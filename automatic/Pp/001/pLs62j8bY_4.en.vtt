00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.649
 ah 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.400
 [Music] 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.250
 ah 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.860
 usually the kittens learn to use 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:25.330
 the sandbox to see his mother do it and 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:27.770
 imitate the others will act instinctively 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.529
 but in many occasions it's our turn to 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:33.379
 ourselves teach or train them 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:35.690
 to use your sandbox in the video of 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:37.970
 today I will show you some ways how 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.550
 They can teach their cats or kittens 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.949
 to use your sandbox 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.590
 I hope the video you like let me 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:47.120
 know your opinion and well let's go to 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.899
 start 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.899
 ah 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.440
 from the fourth and fifth week of 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.860
 life of a kitten we can start 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.600
 train him to use his sandbox 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:04.090
 first of all the sandbox must be 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.840
 short so the kitten can get in 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:09.430
 and leave without problems 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.950
 we will need to put the kitten inside 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.920
 the sandbox in the morning after 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.290
 wake up after every meal and 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.720
 after we've had a session 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.570
 of playing with him once we have it 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.240
 In January we will help you and with 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.100
 his little legs we are going to dig a little 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.170
 so you understand what you can do 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.140
 single 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.180
 usually this method works and for 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.820
 be sincere is the same method that 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.540
 use to teach mumbai to his 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.420
 little brothers to use their litter box 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.390
 another option is to put the kitten inside 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.640
 the box and with the finger play moving the 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.240
 sand as if we were going to bury something 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.440
 surely the kitten out of curiosity 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.930
 will try to imitate the movement and 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.520
 will try to dig the sand may 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.220
 if we are lucky until the kitten 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.650
 use the box at that moment but 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.200
 it will simply come out of it and then 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.870
 we will have to try again a little 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.210
 later on so on until the 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.640
 kitten finally use the sandbox 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:14.250
 and once the kitten has 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.410
 used in the correct way is very 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.320
 important to reward him with either 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.930
 positive words with a toy some 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:25.310
 caress the important thing is to let them know 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.310
 who has done something right 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:32.340
 [Music] 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.800
 to teach an adult cat to use 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.410
 your sandbox let's put the cat 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.890
 inside the sandbox in the morning after 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:43.410
 to wake up and after every meal of 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.920
 same way if your cat uses the box 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:49.410
 correctly make sure to praise him of 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.880
 give a prize to let you know that you have 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.220
 done a good job so that you 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.180
 understand that this is the place where you should 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:59.850
 to do your needs 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.850
 [Music] 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:16.650
 some cats will need to repeat the 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.170
 process several times so that they learn 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.930
 although most of the time 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.450
 Kittens learn the first and are guided 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.000
 by smell to know that that's where 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.490
 they should go but if your cat is a little 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.860
 problematic and you need a little more of 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:34.950
 training one of the things that 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:37.650
 you can do is first choose a 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:40.170
 small room or a bathroom where 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:43.410
 You can confine your cat so 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:46.980
 safe in this room should not be 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:49.590
 no carpets rugs beds or some other 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.660
 surface that your cat can find 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:56.050
 attractive to use as a toilet 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:58.390
 with your food water and bed at one end 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:01.920
 of the room and the sandbox the 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.920
 you are going to place the other end 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.700
 i 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:11.970
 [Music] 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:14.550
 if an accident happens and the cat does 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:17.010
 outside the sandbox lifts the stool and 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:19.079
 put them inside the sandbox and cover it with 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.620
 the sand for the kitten to be guided by 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.620
 the smell 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:31.000
 [Music] 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:40.320
 never hit or yell at the kitten for 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:42.270
 punish him much less if he's inside 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.880
 the sandbox this only 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.360
 It will cause your cat to be afraid of 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:50.370
 you or the box can be counterproductive 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:52.880
 and cause you no longer want to use the 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.880
 sandbox

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.090

 if you tried to change the type of 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:09.340
 sand the box type or the place where 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:12.490
 It is the sandbox and your cat 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:15.419
 still do not want to use it then what 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:18.610
 It is advisable to take him to the vet 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:20.710
 so he can review it and make sure 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.860
 that the problem is not caused by any 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.860
 disease 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.950
