00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
reviews so I got a metal drill bit and I

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.940 
reviews so I got a metal drill bit and I
drilled<00:01:59.420> out<00:01:59.600> and<00:01:59.810> opened<00:02:00.110> up<00:02:00.200> the<00:02:00.380> holes

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.910 

you<00:02:03.950> can't<00:02:04.160> just<00:02:04.369> mount<00:02:05.240> the<00:02:05.500> LCD<00:02:06.500> panel<00:02:06.530> the

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
you can't just mount the LCD panel the

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.150 
you can't just mount the LCD panel the
way<00:02:07.039> it<00:02:07.130> is<00:02:07.280> on<00:02:07.490> the<00:02:08.030> top<00:02:08.239> two<00:02:08.479> screws<00:02:08.950> but<00:02:09.950> all

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
way it is on the top two screws but all

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.900 
way it is on the top two screws but all
the<00:02:10.340> bottom<00:02:10.880> screws<00:02:11.180> won't<00:02:11.360> line<00:02:11.840> up<00:02:12.910> the

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
the bottom screws won't line up the

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:27.120 
the bottom screws won't line up the
bezel<00:02:14.269> will<00:02:14.450> actually<00:02:15.140> ultimately<00:02:15.760> secure

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.430 

now<00:02:28.130> it<00:02:28.520> fits<00:02:29.120> perfectly<00:02:29.630> with<00:02:30.080> the<00:02:30.200> screw

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
now it fits perfectly with the screw

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.050 
now it fits perfectly with the screw
holes<00:02:30.650> opened<00:02:31.190> up<00:02:31.340> the<00:02:32.240> screws<00:02:32.600> fit<00:02:33.820> now<00:02:34.820> put
