00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:16.189
 in the german eschweiler erfurt bart peeters especially 

00:00:17.159 --> 00:00:20.159
 the reason for the robbery 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.890
 South Korea 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.480
 we will do everything with it 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.070
 there was us all 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.530
 so the user can do a lot of things 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.850
 where true all hold true 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.850
 after the tie 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.250
 a 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.820
 can receive the test 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.820
 France 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.180
 draka headed out with the ladies outside 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.010
 werder bremen 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.320
 our waste water ends up on the ground 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.130
 from the sewers the water ends up in this special factory member whip 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.600
 to clean it 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.630
 here a third of her record is on paper and others 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.280
 coarser material 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.950
 to lay the game rules in large bins as you see yourself now completely on 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.090
 full container 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.050
 He hits then comes up through this motley 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.979
 the 

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:23.229
 the water then ends up one of these hit 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:27.879
 In these two smaller field emails can fall to the bottom 

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:48.879
 after the small bath the water goes underground into the large bath 

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:53.309
 in the latter was a lot of questions being the bacteria 

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:57.329
 This creates methane gas that money was used to power 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:00.539
 different turns and everything about complex 

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:04.149
 here it is added to the water by means of points the 

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:05.639
 is air 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:07.410
 due to the presence of oxygen 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.410
 bacteria in the water can degrade the county 

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:15.389
 warned the water is not so good from the first group 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:21.939
 as the last curator in this large round band the judge I have the last 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:24.939
 small field particles to sink to the bottom 

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:28.790
 the clean water then flows to the next fire 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.839
 only then in canals and rivers 

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:34.039
 or well clean water 

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:36.909
 ready to think they are still less 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:40.489
 Whether you see how much work it is already expecting care 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.719
 because it is a lengthy process 

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:46.409
 we can only use a certain amount of water for water purification 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:48.039
 scoop 

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:51.139
 we must therefore be careful not to go too far for what is good 

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:54.799
 it is about saving water 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:58.709
 this is how you ensure that they are much larger 

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:03.539
 of course the power could be tepco 

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:06.219
 from the ground where it comes to that 

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:09.219
 in Sweden 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.610
 comes in our own twitter account daily 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.680
 the fanatic following 

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:36.189
 can enter the water from the room 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:41.360
 was big 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.360
 yummy 

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:48.699
 the users of gmail 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:49.569
 the min 

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:53.270
 But wherever ANP were there do that after the dance floor 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.900
 ma 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.460
 dad 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.050
 r on 

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:33.539
 the smoke that came with the fire made the third culprit a bit warm 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.330
 He has in the month of May 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.050
 on paper in recent weeks 

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:43.439
 that will come later
