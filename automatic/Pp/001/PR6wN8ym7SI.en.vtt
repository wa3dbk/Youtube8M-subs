00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.659 

so<00:00:00.359> when<00:00:00.690> you<00:00:00.780> put<00:00:00.960> all<00:00:01.079> that<00:00:01.230> together<00:00:01.669> what

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
so when you put all that together what

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.030 
so when you put all that together what
do<00:00:02.820> you<00:00:02.939> get<00:00:03.149> well<00:00:03.840> so<00:00:04.230> we've<00:00:04.380> got<00:00:04.560> lots<00:00:04.859> of

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
do you get well so we've got lots of

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.470 
do you get well so we've got lots of
distant<00:00:05.339> galaxies<00:00:05.759> we're<00:00:05.910> now<00:00:06.000> far<00:00:06.270> they<00:00:06.450> are

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
distant galaxies we're now far they are

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.240 
distant galaxies we're now far they are
away<00:00:06.779> we<00:00:06.990> know<00:00:07.109> how<00:00:07.259> fast<00:00:07.529> they're<00:00:07.740> receding

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
away we know how fast they're receding

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.040 
away we know how fast they're receding
what<00:00:08.760> we<00:00:08.880> find<00:00:09.120> is<00:00:09.420> something<00:00:09.750> called<00:00:09.960> the

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
what we find is something called the

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.509 
what we find is something called the
hubble<00:00:10.320> law<00:00:10.349> and<00:00:10.830> it's<00:00:11.099> basically<00:00:11.429> very

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
hubble law and it's basically very

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.270 
hubble law and it's basically very
simple<00:00:11.910> it<00:00:12.420> says<00:00:12.690> that<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.290> further<00:00:13.559> a<00:00:13.740> galaxy

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
simple it says that the further a galaxy

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.279 
simple it says that the further a galaxy
is<00:00:14.400> away<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:15.089> faster<00:00:15.599> it's<00:00:15.750> flying<00:00:15.990> away<00:00:16.170> from

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
is away the faster it's flying away from

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:16.820 
is away the faster it's flying away from
us

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
us

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.310 
us
now<00:00:17.279> how<00:00:17.730> are<00:00:17.760> we<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.090> interpret<00:00:18.690> that<00:00:18.869> I<00:00:19.140> mean

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
now how are we to interpret that I mean

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.779 
now how are we to interpret that I mean
you<00:00:19.380> might<00:00:19.529> naively<00:00:19.680> say<00:00:20.220> well<00:00:20.430> does<00:00:20.730> that

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
you might naively say well does that

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.130 
you might naively say well does that
mean<00:00:20.880> we're<00:00:21.150> somehow<00:00:21.390> at<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.630> center<00:00:21.990> of<00:00:22.020> the

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
mean we're somehow at the center of the

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.540 
mean we're somehow at the center of the
universe<00:00:22.410> and<00:00:22.800> everything's<00:00:23.130> flying<00:00:23.400> away

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
universe and everything's flying away

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.029 
universe and everything's flying away
well<00:00:24.359> no<00:00:24.510> actually<00:00:24.689> if<00:00:25.320> you<00:00:25.470> think<00:00:25.680> a<00:00:25.800> little

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
well no actually if you think a little

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.800 
well no actually if you think a little
bit<00:00:26.160> more<00:00:26.369> if<00:00:26.580> you<00:00:26.640> think<00:00:26.730> for<00:00:27.300> example<00:00:27.390> about

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
bit more if you think for example about

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.589 
bit more if you think for example about
baking<00:00:28.710> bread<00:00:29.010> if<00:00:29.550> you<00:00:29.609> get<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:29.820> lump<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.359> dough

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
baking bread if you get a lump of dough

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.510 
baking bread if you get a lump of dough
and<00:00:30.900> put<00:00:31.050> raisins<00:00:31.320> in<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.040> stick<00:00:32.309> it<00:00:32.340> in

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
and put raisins in it and stick it in

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.090 
and put raisins in it and stick it in
the<00:00:32.550> oven<00:00:32.880> then<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.540> bread<00:00:33.719> expands<00:00:34.230> so<00:00:34.950> all

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
the oven then the bread expands so all

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.979 
the oven then the bread expands so all
the<00:00:35.309> raisins<00:00:35.520> move<00:00:36.000> away<00:00:36.180> from<00:00:36.329> every<00:00:36.870> other

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
the raisins move away from every other

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.069 
the raisins move away from every other
raisin<00:00:37.530> if<00:00:38.040> you<00:00:38.160> sat<00:00:38.460> on<00:00:38.670> one<00:00:38.850> raisin<00:00:39.480> what<00:00:39.960> you

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
raisin if you sat on one raisin what you

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.470 
raisin if you sat on one raisin what you
would<00:00:40.230> see<00:00:40.469> is<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.980> hubble<00:00:41.399> law<00:00:41.430> exactly<00:00:42.149> the

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
would see is the hubble law exactly the

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.360 
would see is the hubble law exactly the
hubble<00:00:42.719> law<00:00:42.750> you'd<00:00:43.290> see<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.590> ones<00:00:43.770> close<00:00:44.129> to

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
hubble law you'd see the ones close to

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.549 
hubble law you'd see the ones close to
you<00:00:44.520> moving<00:00:45.149> away<00:00:45.360> more<00:00:45.539> slowly<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.379> ones

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
you moving away more slowly the ones

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.069 
you moving away more slowly the ones
further<00:00:46.829> away<00:00:47.190> moving<00:00:47.789> away<00:00:48.000> quicker<00:00:48.390> because

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
further away moving away quicker because

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.529 
further away moving away quicker because
the<00:00:49.200> bread<00:00:49.440> is<00:00:49.680> all<00:00:49.860> stretching<00:00:50.430> all<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:51.239> space

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
the bread is all stretching all of space

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.869 
the bread is all stretching all of space
is<00:00:51.780> stretching<00:00:52.350> at<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.500> constant<00:00:52.829> rate<00:00:53.039> so<00:00:53.789> you

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
is stretching at a constant rate so you

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.580 
is stretching at a constant rate so you
get<00:00:54.000> this<00:00:54.120> fascinating<00:00:54.750> law<00:00:55.110> which<00:00:55.440> is

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
get this fascinating law which is

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.529 
get this fascinating law which is
exactly<00:00:56.100> what<00:00:56.340> we<00:00:56.489> observe<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.329> wanted<00:00:57.480> to

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
exactly what we observe and I wanted to

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.299 
exactly what we observe and I wanted to
give<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.960> number<00:00:58.379> because<00:00:58.949> it's<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.160> very

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
give you the number because it's a very

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.979 
give you the number because it's a very
interesting<00:00:59.609> number<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.270> gave<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.600> lecture<00:01:00.809> I

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
interesting number I gave a lecture I

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:01.970

mean<00:01:31.170> it<00:01:31.680> means<00:01:31.740> that<00:01:32.189> for<00:01:32.369> every<00:01:32.460> 3<00:01:32.850> million

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
mean it means that for every 3 million

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.730 
mean it means that for every 3 million
light<00:01:33.479> years<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:33.930> go<00:01:34.079> away<00:01:34.170> from<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.500> earth

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
light years you go away from the earth

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.880 
light years you go away from the earth
then<00:01:35.430> things<00:01:36.090> well<00:01:36.869> if<00:01:37.049> you<00:01:37.140> go<00:01:37.259> 3<00:01:37.560> million

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
then things well if you go 3 million

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.440 
then things well if you go 3 million
light<00:01:38.009> years<00:01:38.040> from<00:01:38.340> Earth<00:01:38.549> -<00:01:38.820> like<00:01:38.970> just<00:01:39.150> step

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
light years from Earth - like just step

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.390 
light years from Earth - like just step
3<00:01:39.840> million<00:01:40.140> light<00:01:40.290> years<00:01:40.320> away<00:01:40.619> then<00:01:41.159> on

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
3 million light years away then on

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.639 
3 million light years away then on
average<00:01:41.579> things<00:01:42.119> will<00:01:42.270> be<00:01:42.360> moving<00:01:42.630> away<00:01:42.750> 42

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
average things will be moving away 42

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.830 
average things will be moving away 42
miles<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:44.100> second<00:01:44.490> it's<00:01:44.909> pretty<00:01:45.090> slow<00:01:45.329> actually

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
miles a second it's pretty slow actually

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.359 
miles a second it's pretty slow actually
there<00:01:46.259> you<00:01:46.350> go<00:01:46.439> six<00:01:46.770> million<00:01:47.040> light<00:01:47.340> years

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
there you go six million light years

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.639 
there you go six million light years
things<00:01:48.149> have<00:01:48.240> been<00:01:48.390> moving<00:01:48.509> away<00:01:48.750> at<00:01:48.930> 84<00:01:49.409> miles

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
things have been moving away at 84 miles

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.010 
things have been moving away at 84 miles
a<00:01:49.829> second<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:50.369> so<00:01:50.549> on<00:01:50.579> so<00:01:51.149> every<00:01:51.450> three

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
a second and so on so every three

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.109 
a second and so on so every three
million<00:01:52.409> light<00:01:52.619> years<00:01:52.649> step<00:01:53.159> you<00:01:53.310> take<00:01:53.549> you

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
million light years step you take you

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.660 
million light years step you take you
add<00:01:54.240> another<00:01:54.509> 42<00:01:55.259> miles<00:01:55.680> per<00:01:55.890> second<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.640> the

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
add another 42 miles per second to the

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.409 
add another 42 miles per second to the
recession<00:01:57.270> velocity<00:01:57.299> of<00:01:58.140> things
