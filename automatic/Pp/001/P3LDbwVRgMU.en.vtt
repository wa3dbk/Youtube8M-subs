 operation of this gun 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:32.340
 pneumatic and also means in 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:37.800
 protection that land and work will require 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:42.300
 with this machine here 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:46.900
 a good number of sheets 14 sheets 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:50.550
 all very well written correctly with

 paragraphs with excerpts 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:56.470
 recommended air pressure lubricants 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:59.730
 funds that need to be added 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:03.600
 during operation 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:06.970
 farther we had such a butter dish 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:09.580
 which was bundled kindly 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.610

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:16.720
 small bonus 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:17.970
 Further lesson which allows very 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.560
 quickly 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:23.320
 I have not used it yet sealed 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.630
 the form is very fast working on 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:30.010
 a few blows there all understood kite 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:33.210
 automatic turn but while I'm at 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:37.300
 studying this device while afraid 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:39.250
 use things in your hands here 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:45.070
 I have a standard nozzle which 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:51.460
 used for hammering it 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:52.110
 I myself have already installed the device 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:58.990
 here 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:05:02.340
 nozzle for working with metal 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:05.020
 fasteners that is, it has 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.970
 specific design which 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.850
 allows us to work without fear 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:13.440
 metal corners of what i'm talking about 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:18.060
 it will be clear to you after I 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:18.060
 I'll show you already ready 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:25.560
 segment you can call it that 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:29.620
 directly 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:31.470
 metal corner 2 to a half 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:38.590
 millimeter 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:40.360
 who was nailed by 67 nails 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:42.510
 what are the nails here 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:45.340
 i'm used here too 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:48.130
 I will demonstrate but it was very important to me 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.870
 so that this unit has the opportunity 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:53.230
 work with metal corners because 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:56.140
 which is very inconvenient to work with large 

00:05:53.230 --> 00:06:00.330
 number of screws if you work 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:04.150
 I will hide with the roof 10k it is used 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:08.830
 this bunch of metal from the tree 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:09.550
 then very very interesting interesting 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:16.720
 addition 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:19.380
 which you need so here for 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:23.080
 safe work we need 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:26.560
 safety glasses were such a menu here 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:29.500
 settings such I found 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:33.340
 will continue to have to wear gloves but 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:36.580
 I have them here just look for reluctance 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:40.870
 two main things you need 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:45.840
 will put on your body for protection 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:49.360
 when working with a pneumatic gun 

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:53.590
 I'll tell you a little nails here 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:59.340
 we are represented by two clips one clip 

00:06:53.590 --> 00:07:02.860
 started already at 90 it goes plastic 

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:05.590
 such a vent that flies in 

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:09.820
 strike time 

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:11.130
 pneumatic rod and nails on 60 

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:13.260
 millimeters 

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:18.810
 which have exactly the same design 

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:22.650
 they are specially made 

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:26.590
 knurled in my opinion it is called 

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:30.010
 ring rolling so which allows 

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:33.540
 very firmly fix the nail in 

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:38.290
 wood and virtually eliminates it 

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:40.660
 any encroachments if you 

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:43.330
 try to rip it out with any 

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:46.420
 way it is already tightly by and large 

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:48.310
 account is now a small introductory 

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:50.060
 video will most likely be over by 

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:51.680
 the reason 

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:54.050
 sparsity of my beloved 

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:58.900
 a battery that is thousands of years old 

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:58.900
 the most necessary moment is discharged
