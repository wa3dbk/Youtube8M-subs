00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
this video I'm going to show you how you

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.929 
this video I'm going to show you how you
can<00:00:17.789> use<00:00:18.570> a<00:00:18.600> math<00:00:19.230> formula<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:20.189> figure<00:00:20.730> out

can use a math formula to figure out

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.390 
can use a math formula to figure out
exactly<00:00:21.270> where<00:00:22.080> to<00:00:22.109> position<00:00:23.480> the<00:00:25.400> center

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
exactly where to position the center

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.890 
exactly where to position the center
point<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:27.590> the<00:00:28.590> circle<00:00:28.920> on<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.580> fence<00:00:30.210> so<00:00:30.689> that

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
point of the circle on the fence so that

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.319 
point of the circle on the fence so that
it<00:00:31.050> will<00:00:31.170> be<00:00:31.430> exactly<00:00:32.430> where<00:00:32.669> you<00:00:32.850> want<00:00:33.090> it<00:00:33.149> to

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
it will be exactly where you want it to

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.170 
it will be exactly where you want it to
first<00:00:34.320> up<00:00:34.559> on<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.770> list<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.370> will<00:00:35.579> need<00:00:35.910> to

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
first up on the list you will need to

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.110 
first up on the list you will need to
start<00:00:36.510> with<00:00:36.780> some<00:00:37.260> extended<00:00:38.120> fencing

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
start with some extended fencing

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.639 
start with some extended fencing
something<00:00:39.750> that's<00:00:39.930> going<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.140> be<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.290> little

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
something that's going to be a little

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.459 
something that's going to be a little
longer<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:42.270> course<00:00:42.540> you<00:00:42.750> will<00:00:43.020> need<00:00:43.260> to

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
longer and of course you will need to

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.270 
longer and of course you will need to
find<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.890> center<00:00:44.399> point<00:00:44.430> of<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.510> fence<00:00:46.280> now

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
find the center point of the fence now

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.470 
find the center point of the fence now
this<00:00:47.430> is<00:00:47.579> what<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:47.820> would<00:00:47.910> look<00:00:47.969> like<00:00:48.270> if<00:00:48.450> you

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
this is what it would look like if you

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.150 
this is what it would look like if you
just<00:00:48.719> do<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:48.930> regular<00:00:49.350> circle<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.860> this<00:00:49.920> might

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
just do a regular circle and this might

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.610 
just do a regular circle and this might
not<00:00:50.340> be<00:00:50.579> what<00:00:50.789> you<00:00:50.820> want<00:00:50.989> so<00:00:51.989> what<00:00:52.199> if<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.440> just

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
not be what you want so what if you just

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.549 
not be what you want so what if you just
wanted<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.329> create<00:00:54.329> something<00:00:54.690> with<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.079> 10

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
wanted to create something with a 10

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.930 
wanted to create something with a 10
inch<00:00:56.149> total<00:00:57.149> arch<00:00:57.920> or<00:00:58.920> arc<00:00:59.280> that<00:00:59.520> that's<00:00:59.730> the

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
inch total arch or arc that that's the

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.390 
inch total arch or arc that that's the
maximum<00:01:00.690> height<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:02.180> the<00:01:03.860> that's<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.010> maximum

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
maximum height of the that's the maximum

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.710 
maximum height of the that's the maximum
height<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.650> gate<00:01:07.729> top<00:01:08.729> of<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.030> gate<00:01:09.270> that

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
height of the gate top of the gate that

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.840 
height of the gate top of the gate that
you<00:01:10.020> want<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.770> again<00:01:11.130> these<00:01:11.280> numbers<00:01:11.670> can

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
you want and again these numbers can

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.609 
you want and again these numbers can
vary<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:12.299> can<00:01:12.479> plug<00:01:12.689> in<00:01:12.869> different<00:01:12.990> numbers

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
vary you can plug in different numbers

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.210 
vary you can plug in different numbers
but<00:01:13.770> we're<00:01:14.010> going<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.310> use<00:01:14.430> 10<00:01:15.030> inches<00:01:15.630> as<00:01:16.220> our

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
but we're going to use 10 inches as our

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.410 
but we're going to use 10 inches as our
height<00:01:18.439> 36<00:01:19.439> inches<00:01:19.979> for<00:01:20.250> our<00:01:20.280> width<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.240> these

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
height 36 inches for our width and these

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.700 
height 36 inches for our width and these
are<00:01:21.540> going<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.720> be<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.049> two<00:01:22.229> numbers<00:01:22.560> we're

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
are going to be the two numbers we're

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.859 
are going to be the two numbers we're
going<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:22.890> need<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.549> go<00:01:24.180> through<00:01:24.420> this<00:01:24.600> math

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
going to need to go through this math

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.320 
going to need to go through this math
formula<00:01:25.409> let's<00:01:25.979> take<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.310> look<00:01:26.460> at<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.729> formula

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
formula let's take a look at the formula

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.260 
formula let's take a look at the formula
for<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.900> gate<00:01:28.080> radius<00:01:28.700> we're<00:01:29.700> going<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.030> have

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
for the gate radius we're going to have

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.440 
for the gate radius we're going to have
the<00:01:30.840> height<00:01:31.259> over<00:01:31.560> 2<00:01:32.100> or<00:01:32.369> height<00:01:32.670> divided<00:01:33.240> by<00:01:33.270> 2

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
the height over 2 or height divided by 2

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.899 
the height over 2 or height divided by 2
plus<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.409> width<00:01:34.680> squared<00:01:36.470> over<00:01:37.470> height<00:01:38.009> times

8 or 8 times height I'm sorry and I'm

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.510 
8 or 8 times height I'm sorry and I'm
going<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:42.930> break<00:01:43.140> it<00:01:43.290> down<00:01:43.320> here<00:01:43.799> for<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.280> on

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
going to break it down here for you on

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.590 
going to break it down here for you on
the<00:01:45.090> Left<00:01:45.770> 10<00:01:46.770> is<00:01:47.100> our<00:01:47.490> height<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:48.360> we're

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
the Left 10 is our height that we're

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.330 
the Left 10 is our height that we're
trying<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.990> achieve<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.590> total<00:01:49.920> height<00:01:50.100> of

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
trying to achieve the total height of

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.100 
trying to achieve the total height of
our<00:01:50.790> arc<00:01:51.210> we<00:01:52.200> are<00:01:52.320> going<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.799> divide<00:01:53.159> that<00:01:53.460> by<00:01:53.520> 2

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
our arc we are going to divide that by 2

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.160 
our arc we are going to divide that by 2
which<00:01:55.110> gives<00:01:55.140> us<00:01:55.619> 5<00:01:55.890> then<00:01:56.700> we're<00:01:56.969> going<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.390> the

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
which gives us 5 then we're going to the

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.840 
which gives us 5 then we're going to the
other<00:01:58.380> side<00:01:58.710> of<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.890> formula<00:01:59.430> we're<00:01:59.579> going<00:01:59.610> to

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
other side of the formula we're going to

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.950 
other side of the formula we're going to
multiply<00:02:00.479> 36<00:02:01.200> times<00:02:01.920> 36<00:02:02.390> which<00:02:03.390> would<00:02:03.630> be<00:02:03.750> the

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
multiply 36 times 36 which would be the

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.490 
multiply 36 times 36 which would be the
width<00:02:04.259> of<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.920> gate<00:02:05.479> squared<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:07.049> width<00:02:07.320> of

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
width of the gate squared the width of

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.339 
width of the gate squared the width of
the<00:02:07.649> gate<00:02:07.890> times<00:02:08.520> itself<00:02:09.330> is<00:02:09.690> how<00:02:09.869> you<00:02:09.929> square

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
the gate times itself is how you square

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.470 
the gate times itself is how you square
a<00:02:10.379> number<00:02:10.679> then<00:02:11.610> we're<00:02:11.760> going<00:02:11.879> to<00:02:11.910> divide<00:02:12.420> that

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
a number then we're going to divide that

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.449 
a number then we're going to divide that
number

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
heights murmur ten is the height we're

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.099 
heights murmur ten is the height we're
trying<00:02:19.950> to<00:02:20.129> achieve<00:02:20.329> so<00:02:21.329> that's<00:02:21.719> going<00:02:21.989> to

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:22.109 
trying to achieve so that's going to

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:29.449 
trying to achieve so that's going to
give<00:02:22.469> us<00:02:22.499> 80<00:02:23.299> 36<00:02:24.299> times<00:02:24.569> 36<00:02:24.950> equals<00:02:26.450> 12<00:02:27.450> 96<00:02:28.260> at<00:02:29.219> 8

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
give us 80 36 times 36 equals 12 96 at 8

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.879 
give us 80 36 times 36 equals 12 96 at 8
times<00:02:29.939> 10<00:02:31.459> the<00:02:32.459> next<00:02:32.849> step<00:02:33.060> is<00:02:33.329> going<00:02:33.659> to<00:02:33.780> be<00:02:34.200> to

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:34.889 
times 10 the next step is going to be to

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:38.690 
times 10 the next step is going to be to
divide<00:02:35.519> 80<00:02:36.239> into<00:02:37.159> twelve<00:02:38.159> hundred<00:02:38.430> and

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
divide 80 into twelve hundred and

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.459 
divide 80 into twelve hundred and
ninety-six<00:02:39.450> when<00:02:39.780> we<00:02:39.900> divide<00:02:40.230> these<00:02:40.409> numbers

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:40.469 
ninety-six when we divide these numbers

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:43.009 
ninety-six when we divide these numbers
we<00:02:41.069> get<00:02:41.219> sixteen<00:02:41.909> point<00:02:42.269> two<00:02:42.389> and<00:02:42.599> remember

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
we get sixteen point two and remember

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.780 
we get sixteen point two and remember
all<00:02:43.230> of<00:02:43.260> our<00:02:43.560> measurements<00:02:43.859> are<00:02:44.280> in<00:02:44.430> inches

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
all of our measurements are in inches

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.959 
all of our measurements are in inches
not<00:02:45.329> feet<00:02:45.810> if<00:02:46.439> you<00:02:46.889> were<00:02:47.040> using<00:02:47.219> feet<00:02:47.700> then

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:47.969 
not feet if you were using feet then

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:50.420 
not feet if you were using feet then
your<00:02:48.239> number<00:02:48.599> here<00:02:49.109> would<00:02:49.530> actually<00:02:49.980> be<00:02:50.189> feet

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
your number here would actually be feet

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.979 
your number here would actually be feet
so<00:02:50.639> you<00:02:50.730> could<00:02:50.849> actually<00:02:51.000> get<00:02:51.389> let's<00:02:51.750> just<00:02:51.900> say

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
so you could actually get let's just say

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.459 
so you could actually get let's just say
you<00:02:52.079> arrived<00:02:52.500> at<00:02:53.810> 0.75<00:02:54.810> then<00:02:55.139> that<00:02:55.290> would<00:02:55.379> be

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:55.469 
you arrived at 0.75 then that would be

00:02:55.469 --> 00:02:59.360 
you arrived at 0.75 then that would be
3/4<00:02:56.069> of<00:02:56.099> a<00:02:56.310> foot<00:02:56.669> that<00:02:57.629> you<00:02:57.870> would<00:02:58.079> be<00:02:58.290> using<00:02:59.040> so

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
3/4 of a foot that you would be using so

3/4 of a foot that you would be using so

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
going to be our radius so hopefully that

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:33.589 
going to be our radius so hopefully that
makes<00:03:32.159> sense<00:03:32.459> and<00:03:32.699> hopefully<00:03:32.819> it's<00:03:33.209> simple

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
makes sense and hopefully it's simple

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.449 
makes sense and hopefully it's simple
enough<00:03:33.689> if<00:03:34.049> not<00:03:34.290> leave<00:03:34.709> some<00:03:34.919> questions<00:03:35.280> in

00:03:39.249 --> 00:03:39.259 
the comment area and I will see if I can

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:41.030 
the comment area and I will see if I can
provide<00:03:40.259> you<00:03:40.319> with<00:03:40.470> a<00:03:40.620> little<00:03:40.889> more

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
provide you with a little more

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.860 
provide you with a little more
information<00:03:41.519> but<00:03:42.090> hopefully<00:03:42.479> that<00:03:42.659> makes

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
information but hopefully that makes

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.800 
information but hopefully that makes
them<00:03:43.109> you<00:03:43.859> can<00:03:44.129> use<00:03:44.370> the<00:03:44.579> radius<00:03:45.090> now<00:03:45.329> that<00:03:45.629> you

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
them you can use the radius now that you

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.699 
them you can use the radius now that you
have<00:03:46.109> it<00:03:46.349> and<00:03:47.629> mark<00:03:48.629> the<00:03:48.989> exact<00:03:49.439> position

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
have it and mark the exact position

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.069 
have it and mark the exact position
instead<00:03:50.609> of<00:03:50.759> guessing<00:03:50.970> like<00:03:51.419> you<00:03:51.629> would<00:03:51.870> have

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
instead of guessing like you would have

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:56.899 
instead of guessing like you would have
in<00:03:52.409> the<00:03:52.530> other<00:03:52.769> two<00:03:53.099> videos<00:03:53.609> and<00:03:55.729> and<00:03:56.729> again

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:56.909 
in the other two videos and and again

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:58.399 
in the other two videos and and again
you<00:03:57.150> don't<00:03:57.239> have<00:03:57.359> to<00:03:57.479> the<00:03:57.900> other<00:03:57.989> two<00:03:58.199> videos

00:03:58.399 --> 00:03:58.409 
you don't have to the other two videos

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:00.649 
you don't have to the other two videos
if<00:03:58.889> that's<00:03:59.099> going<00:03:59.219> to<00:03:59.280> work<00:03:59.489> for<00:03:59.549> you<00:03:59.969> do<00:04:00.449> it

00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:00.659 
if that's going to work for you do it

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:03.740 
if that's going to work for you do it
you<00:04:00.959> can<00:04:01.109> always<00:04:01.290> make<00:04:01.949> a<00:04:02.009> few<00:04:02.280> marks<00:04:02.489> and<00:04:02.819> get

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
you can always make a few marks and get

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.330 
you can always make a few marks and get
close<00:04:04.049> enough<00:04:04.319> it<00:04:04.709> doesn't<00:04:04.979> have<00:04:05.069> to<00:04:05.219> be

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
close enough it doesn't have to be

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.159 
close enough it doesn't have to be
perfect<00:04:05.879> but<00:04:06.060> if<00:04:06.180> you<00:04:06.269> do<00:04:06.389> want<00:04:06.599> it<00:04:06.659> perfect

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:07.169 
perfect but if you do want it perfect

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:09.860 
perfect but if you do want it perfect
this<00:04:07.889> is<00:04:07.949> how<00:04:08.250> you<00:04:08.340> can<00:04:08.669> do<00:04:08.879> it<00:04:08.909> and<00:04:09.419> again<00:04:09.780> this

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
this is how you can do it and again this

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.869 
this is how you can do it and again this
isn't<00:04:10.109> that<00:04:10.319> complicated<00:04:11.250> I<00:04:11.459> should<00:04:11.699> say

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:11.879 
isn't that complicated I should say

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:15.409 
isn't that complicated I should say
hopefully<00:04:12.409> but<00:04:13.409> after<00:04:13.709> you<00:04:13.859> have<00:04:14.069> your<00:04:14.759> radius

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:15.419 
hopefully but after you have your radius

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:17.810 
hopefully but after you have your radius
you<00:04:15.870> will<00:04:16.109> need<00:04:16.349> to<00:04:16.500> measure<00:04:16.739> down<00:04:17.190> from<00:04:17.549> the

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
you will need to measure down from the

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.399 
you will need to measure down from the
top<00:04:18.120> of<00:04:18.560> the<00:04:19.669> curve<00:04:20.669> or<00:04:21.000> the<00:04:21.810> top<00:04:21.989> of<00:04:22.260> the

00:04:22.399 --> 00:04:22.409 
top of the curve or the top of the

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:24.650 
top of the curve or the top of the
circle<00:04:22.650> top<00:04:23.070> of<00:04:23.279> the<00:04:23.460> arch

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
circle top of the arch

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.870 
circle top of the arch
you<00:04:25.410> will<00:04:25.620> not<00:04:25.770> measure<00:04:26.040> from<00:04:26.280> the<00:04:26.430> top<00:04:26.580> of<00:04:26.640> the

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
you will not measure from the top of the

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.090 
you will not measure from the top of the
fence<00:04:27.150> so<00:04:27.690> for<00:04:28.500> example<00:04:29.010> if<00:04:29.580> I'm<00:04:29.940> going<00:04:30.000> to<00:04:30.720> use

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
fence so for example if I'm going to use

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.240 
fence so for example if I'm going to use
21.2<00:04:32.100> for<00:04:32.430> my<00:04:32.520> 36<00:04:33.090> inch<00:04:33.300> wide<00:04:33.570> gate<00:04:33.960> I'm<00:04:34.770> going

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
21.2 for my 36 inch wide gate I'm going

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.630 
21.2 for my 36 inch wide gate I'm going
to<00:04:35.400> need<00:04:35.610> to<00:04:35.910> extend<00:04:36.630> the<00:04:37.170> line<00:04:37.500> 10<00:04:37.950> inches<00:04:38.370> up

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:38.640 
to need to extend the line 10 inches up

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
to need to extend the line 10 inches up
and<00:04:39.590> then<00:04:40.590> or<00:04:40.890> subtract<00:04:41.520> the<00:04:41.700> 10<00:04:41.910> inches<00:04:42.330> and

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
and then or subtract the 10 inches and

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.700 
and then or subtract the 10 inches and
then<00:04:42.990> go<00:04:43.680> 11<00:04:44.640> point<00:04:45.000> 2<00:04:45.150> down<00:04:45.660> from<00:04:46.110> the<00:04:46.230> top<00:04:46.470> of

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
then go 11 point 2 down from the top of

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.010 
then go 11 point 2 down from the top of
the<00:04:47.100> fence<00:04:47.610> so<00:04:48.090> I<00:04:48.120> hope<00:04:48.420> that<00:04:48.450> makes<00:04:48.840> sense

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
the fence so I hope that makes sense

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.960 
the fence so I hope that makes sense
again<00:04:49.530> you<00:04:50.010> have<00:04:50.100> any<00:04:50.220> questions<00:04:50.640> leave<00:04:50.880> them
