this<00:01:15.580> this<00:01:15.940> is<00:01:16.150> a<00:01:16.180> swish<00:01:16.540> rod<00:01:16.869> that<00:01:17.110> they<00:01:17.320> used

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
this this is a swish rod that they used

this this is a swish rod that they used
to<00:01:17.979> make<00:01:18.100> it<00:01:18.280> was<00:01:18.460> concept<00:01:18.910> because<00:01:19.150> we<00:01:19.330> did

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
to make it was concept because we did

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.430 
to make it was concept because we did
have<00:01:19.630> some<00:01:19.840> real<00:01:20.380> deep<00:01:20.860> perch<00:01:21.820> lakes<00:01:22.180> and<00:01:22.510> for

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
have some real deep perch lakes and for

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.109 
have some real deep perch lakes and for
here<00:01:23.680> it's<00:01:23.830> not<00:01:23.979> too<00:01:24.220> practical<00:01:24.520> although<00:01:25.090> i

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
here it's not too practical although i

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:27.390 
here it's not too practical although i
still<00:01:25.210> can<00:01:25.600> use<00:01:25.810> it<00:01:25.990> but<00:01:26.200> what<00:01:26.800> these<00:01:26.979> little

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
still can use it but what these little

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.230 
still can use it but what these little
sort<00:01:27.970> of<00:01:28.090> like<00:01:28.979> almost<00:01:29.979> paperclip<00:01:30.729> things<00:01:31.000> are

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
sort of like almost paperclip things are

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.300 
sort of like almost paperclip things are
let's<00:01:31.780> say<00:01:32.020> you're<00:01:32.200> catching<00:01:32.710> them<00:01:32.800> at<00:01:33.010> this

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
let's say you're catching them at this

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.520 
let's say you're catching them at this

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
depth so i get my rig setup i find out

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.290 
depth so i get my rig setup i find out
where<00:01:35.680> the<00:01:35.800> bottom<00:01:36.160> is<00:01:36.310> and<00:01:36.610> i<00:01:36.940> want<00:01:37.150> to<00:01:37.180> be
