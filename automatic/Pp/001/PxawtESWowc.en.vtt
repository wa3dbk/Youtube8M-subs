00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.690 
which i think i can do I have a 9 inch
of<00:01:03.840> reach<00:01:03.989> advantage<00:01:04.199> here<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:04.949> i<00:01:05.070> think<00:01:05.339> if<00:01:05.519> i

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
of reach advantage here and i think if i

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.789 
of reach advantage here and i think if i
can<00:01:05.880> utilize<00:01:06.119> that<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:07.229> know<00:01:07.290> i<00:01:07.350> should<00:01:07.650> be

see<00:05:28.440> how<00:05:28.620> it<00:05:28.770> could<00:05:29.010> go<00:05:29.190> five<00:05:29.490> rounds<00:05:29.720> so<00:05:31.040> you

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:32.040 
see how it could go five rounds so you

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.680 
see how it could go five rounds so you
know<00:05:32.100> already<00:05:32.490> he<00:05:33.030> can't<00:05:33.270> take<00:05:33.419> much<00:05:33.660> more

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:33.690
