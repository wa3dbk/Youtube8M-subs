00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.990 

the<00:02:28.959> lesson<00:02:29.410> that<00:02:29.830> I'd<00:02:30.280> like<00:02:30.520> everybody<00:02:30.790> to

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
the lesson that I'd like everybody to

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.610 
the lesson that I'd like everybody to
take<00:02:31.239> away<00:02:31.480> from<00:02:31.720> it<00:02:31.810> is<00:02:32.020> that<00:02:32.320> we're<00:02:32.500> actually

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
take away from it is that we're actually

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:46.190

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.380 

the<00:02:47.200> maximum<00:02:50.100> no<00:02:51.100> you<00:02:51.160> probably<00:02:51.820> should<00:02:52.360> call
