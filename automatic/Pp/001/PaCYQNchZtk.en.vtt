00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.299
 very good people good many 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.070
 thanks a video of operations beats 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:14.230
 then we are here with grapes from the 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.390
 go to' 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.770
 Well, more or less we still 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.180
 there are still many attacks to be made and 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.740
 I think we had never taken the 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.990
 dock base for example with which 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.430
 let's see how how to destroy it worth 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.599
 I think that now when we see explore 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.430
 is already completely devastated with what 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:29.289
 which we will not see anything effectively 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.140
 very well and what happens if I give sabotage 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:33.600
 Now I'm not going to spend interest on 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.760
 spend the good ones I will teach how 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.710
 we surpass ourselves the base is very worth it 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.269
 then we start here is worth in 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.550
 thugs and your house is also the army 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:44.829
 that we have faced 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.180
 until this base then well then 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:47.739
 we started with the first attack I'm going to 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.030
 put a little bit a quick poquillo vale 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:51.670
 so that they go forward 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.920
 relatively quickly now then 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.000
 here we have we are removing first 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.620
 the defenses that we 're leaving 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.969
 finding out there and notice how good 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.829
 thus immobilizing the defenses more 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:01.420
 key that more damage they can do it 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:04.019
 yes if it is necessary using smoke 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.190
 the better it break 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.220
 energy containers or things 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:11.800
 green these radioactive mucus is good 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.840
 because every time it breaks is a building 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.860
 loses life in the central core with what 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.479
 which one is fixed or is being removed 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.830
 energy we are taking away life that 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.090
 then in the future at the end that is 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.210
 this is about breaking it 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.950
 with which good then yes that all 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.719
 the energy that you can already remove from 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.859
 beforehand better than better because that's the way it is 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:28.569
 less time you have to be later 

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:30.670
 when you reach the center hitting it 

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:31.960
 Well, here are the advances 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.429
 units the only thing that we have here is the 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.659
 mortar this corpse hurts but as 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:36.219
 It is only one, for the moment it is 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:37.509
 reasonably controlled as soon as 

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:39.340
 trout arrive as it is entertaining 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:41.350
 and with the buttons, the poor thing does not 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.659
 he finds out he does not know anything and he's 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.329
 dying to marches to forced marches 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.530
 good for here so good the bullies 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:48.549
 they endure what they put up with but now 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.810
 clear as there are no defenses 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:51.220
 splash around here that can make us 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.869
 damage because it is not yet inside the 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.319
 reach of the rocket launchers neither of the nor 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:57.670
 shocked the boom cannon or the cannons 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:58.929
 normal are killing them from a moon with 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.399
 which look at the damage they have done to the 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:01.599
 end all to all the guns that 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.390
 they were the ones that were causing us 

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:07.569
 bigger problems well let's say that 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.129
 we come to a point where the girls 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:11.680
 would enter into the radiation of the 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:13.239
 rocket launcher with which not now 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.340
 we're going to have to do in the raid 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:16.989
 a little faster a little bit more 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.340
 direct but clear with the advantage that 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.329
 we have already removed all the defenses 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.310
 that there was here with which already 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:23.730
 we can go directly to sack 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.769
 take away these cannons that are around here 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.670
 to try to avoid the rocket launcher and 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:32.310
 shocked here the boom cannon 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.870
 has suddenly caught one of the 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.750
 girls but good does not happen either 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.610
 because a sugar at the moment 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.230
 losing one is not going to mark the 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.549
 difference here what what annoys of 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.930
 truth is that the rocket launcher suddenly 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:44.610
 of busting the whole group of his 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.560
 so the jacket which was a doctor 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.319
 the cannon ship is being this 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:53.579
 warrior that good cannon come in already 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:58.349
 here it's worth sticking to the units and 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:59.579
 clearly and logically the thugs are the 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:00.810
 who are receiving the most 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:03.060
 of damage but yes while we have 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.010
 immobilized to all the medium cannons 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.780
 endure and are the ones that can 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.549
 receive the damage the damage 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.989
 rocket launcher then that goes around 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:12.750
 well it has also released a little bit 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.519
 ammunition to support the gunboat to 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.720
 those cannon boom but good up here 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.670
 is how good is it then another 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.440
 another small incursion with which we are going 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.180
 advancing more and more you see every time 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:25.019
 we are already like more in then 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.849
 now it is the turn of the next voucher 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.360
 that we would have it here we are going to give it 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:30.540
 here to see 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:33.300
 to see the battle here we have it we are going to 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.830
 Give a little cane and it's worth positions 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.510
 who comes here again takes them 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.460
 there the lateral one we are going to give him there is a 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.830
 little bit of speed all this ride that 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.870
 they give themselves that the troops are given already you know 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.160
 always always always always and now 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.080
 we are going to enter already here we are going to 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.600
 put us in an area that is already far away 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.340
 of these of these rocket launchers for 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.930
 enter from that side it's worth identifying 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.030
 that we forgot about these cannons 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.260
 that we already say that they are annoying and that 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.690
 The only thing they do is destroy us 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.459
 things and good luck very much now not 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.440
 have lost that little group of sugar and 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.600
 notice that it is loading a lot 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.980
 many, many, many defenses 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.780
 lots of buildings out there so 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.130
 that we already have all this pretty done 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.610
 look at the boom cannon is also a 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:13.230
 point to fall is he has been wrong 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.360
 launching releasing the immobilization 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.829
 over with which better still better or 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.780
 let's say that the attack already works 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:20.459
 reasonably well and notice that you have already 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.079
 reached a point where he has cleared 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.520
 much of the area of â€‹â€‹the area 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.910
 up we only have one rocket launcher those 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.380
 and the others operate and the rocket launchers 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.510
 they do not arrive they do not reach so far 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.969
 now it's breaking buildings because you 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:35.509
 again say the same 

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:38.809
 the basic ones are radioactive mucus 

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:42.080
 help because in the end it is what goes 

00:04:38.809 --> 00:04:44.539
 that is slowly subtracting life 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.370
 the supposed headquarters the basic one is 

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:47.659
 in search of a sugar that stays 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.979
 for one minute in an area where 

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:50.569
 does not shoot anything with which good 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:52.969
 When this happens, you do not have more 

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:54.620
 remedy to wait and see how much damage 

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:56.210
 can you do the truth that I do not know 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.219
 if he broke it he did not break it right now 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.050
 right now we see it yes I think yes 

00:04:58.219 --> 00:05:01.639
 he broke it then it's good because 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.150
 at least that is what we have won 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:04.680
 OK 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.480
 novice that the game is going to 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.620
 interrupt in five minutes due to a 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.180
 maintenance servers with which 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.410
 let's see this super fast, it's worth 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.780
 we are about to finish this is 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.490
 the penultimate attack indicated and we bring 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.620
 everything here forward and now nothing 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.910
 just new player that comes as 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.500
 let's say with all the energy of the 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:22.110
 gunship the only thing that is 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.610
 doing is going and half defending their 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.320
 units causing damage to the building 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.570
 central and good because in the end it has 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.550
 removed half of the life he brought 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:32.730
 we go quickly to see the last vale 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:34.830
 squeeze that basically already once 

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:36.810
 arrived at this point is to repeat it one and 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:40.380
 again until you have it until 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:41.670
 that already break the vessel and already in 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.320
 that moment, because that's what all the 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:44.940
 defenses and you take all the all the 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.740
 victory points not only the usual no 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.480
 then nothing to see let's put it here 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.470
 and a little more slowly let's say 

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:52.080
 starts starts shooting the 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:54.210
 rocket launcher at the moment leaves them and now 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.500
 is when you immobilize fix the damage 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.820
 what they do is they are three rocket launchers that 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.170
 man to be of such a high level because yes 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:00.480
 they do quite a lot 

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:02.100
 little but at the moment then nothing 

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.930
 simply also supports a little bit with 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.810
 he with his own gunship also supports 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:07.120
 to the 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:08.350
 to destruction and throwing him there is a 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.730
 little missiles are still there 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:12.070
 many routes that do a lot 

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:13.150
 damage per second heals and a little to those 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:14.980
 Turkish so that he can hold the first 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:16.450
 blows that there is a free thug and what 

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.500
 get a little in extremis in 

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:20.680
 any case if I had not gotten 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:22.000
 we would have this to the next 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.160
 next attempt with what good then 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.470
 that 's how we spent dock grapes 

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.960
 anger with fundamentally decreed been 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:30.820
 thugs and you homes with what is with what 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.010
 that we have spent quite simple and 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:34.480
 well, nothing in case yours 

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:35.830
 operational form is stuck with me in 

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.510
 this mission dock either new from the 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:38.919
 one way or any other because then yes 

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:40.389
 I feel that the appearance of defenses 

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:41.800
