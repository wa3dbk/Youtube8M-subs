 hello to all guys I welcome 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.759
 in this second video where I will make you 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.370
 see all the official trailers of 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.650
 total drama all stars that have gone 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.599
 broadcast on cartoon network 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.549
 these 3 trailers have given many 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.699
 confirmations especially regarding the 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.310
 teams in fact as we will see shortly 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.869
 in the trailer you can see wen with the vultures 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.699
 also in this video 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.949
 I would like to share some of you with you 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.560
 impressions and comment on images 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.769
 you can write yours in the comments 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.920
 I will be happy to read them and respond to you 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:33.630
 ok 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.670
 let's start right away from the first trailer 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:55.410
 aired on cartoon network 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:57.420
 then we will comment on it together as it is 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.120
 you could see this trailer not 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.559
 reveals nothing sensational but since 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.629
 you have all three in English 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.460
 I decided today to convene the 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.909
 professor of the University of 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.250
 London 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.830
 don't ask me how it ended up there 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.820
 teach there but so are the traumas of 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.799
 life 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.990
 I remind you that because of the shameful 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.450
 quality of his cam band probably 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.820
 the video will have a low resolution but 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:25.400
 the important thing is to hear the audio I say well 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.400
 ok let's make a round of applause to jack 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.280
 language 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:52.069
 I hope in poverty but she sucks is a 

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:57.319
 worm you will have clearly preferred a 

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:59.509
 tramp without 20 thanks professor jack 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:01.450
 we will contact you in the future if we have any 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:04.130
 need 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.860
 ok let's forget the crap and 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.450
 let's enjoy something more exciting 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.579
 the first time I saw this 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.530
 trailer I got so excited about 

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:15.380
 almost not sleeping for a whole night 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:18.040
 ok enough with the chat we send the 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.040
 second trailer 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.569
 the first time you see this video 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.520
 besides being cited as gods 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.870
 chameleons will also be partially 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.670
 confused 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.950
 let's start from the beginning with this one first 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.630
 photo in this image 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.790
 we easily notice the team of 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.770
 heroic hamsters with short hair of 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.380
 sierra but concord in the undecided on 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.150
 something maybe he wanted to be in 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.959
 team with duncan 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.190
 but how come we get upset ok? 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.019
 in this other photo 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.519
 we note that duncan and gwen collaborate e 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.260
 they smile at each other 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:20.440
 maybe this is the signal they are 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:26.110
 still together with this photo I enjoy from 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:28.989
 die scott you are one i hope the 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.670
 concept be clear well guys now vi 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:32.680
 I leave to some images that you can 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.970
 admire with excitement at the end 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.970
 we will comment on the most important ones 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:12.370
 I hope the images are fine 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:14.169
 liked we could comment on one but one 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.849
 unfortunately there is time and I would not 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:17.650
 make video too long which 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:19.389
 length is determined by mine 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.590
 comments that you could also 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:22.590
 be incorrect 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:25.240
 but everyone has their own thoughts 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:28.090
 however we comment or some 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.130
 just to do some reflection in 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.740
 this scene the first thing there is 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:34.900
 jumped to mind is alejandro robot o 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.599
 fuck my leandro has become a 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:40.090
 robots they boys alejandro will be a 

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:41.919
 robot but it could be for little 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:43.449
 there are rumors around who have 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:45.340
 inserted the robot because the new one 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:46.750
 Alejandro's voice actor was not yet 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.460
 available 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:51.430
 okay I think it will be a season 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:53.560
 epic with a capital letter 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.300
 meanwhile we also see scott trying to 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:58.210
 make your team lose while 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.680
 bank looks bad this photo has me 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:01.539
 hit a lot 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.610
 we see the whole team of vultures 

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:05.680
 evil to make a wicked laugh 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:09.699
 against gwen including duncan 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:12.370
 how come what eder has i 

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:13.240
 many collected hair say it is one 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.830
 tour scene 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.570
 but if you notice it has no gold tooth 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:17.770
 so it's authentic 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:20.139
 the strange thing is that in another 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:22.419
 image to the longest ponytail 

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:24.190
 what is the explanation 

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:27.070
 we will see it only when the 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:29.139
 series in this last image we see 

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:31.419
 that both hamsters and vultures 

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:33.099
 they rejoice for something, perhaps for the 

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:34.960
 loss of vultures 

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:38.469
 maybe the vultures want to throw 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:40.960
 out gwen and lose so rejoice 

00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:41.639
 I strongly doubt it so you what 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.590
 think 

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:46.719
 very little time ago christian power up 

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:49.690
 facebook announced the return of 

00:06:46.719 --> 00:06:53.820
 Mr. Coconut Professor Jack Can Read Us 

00:06:49.690 --> 00:07:00.630
 what he wrote and translate thanks on 

00:06:53.820 --> 00:07:00.630
 campus air office and central drinks 

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:13.540
 but what kind of crap then I translate 

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:15.370
 me since she can't do shit 

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:16.870
 in practice christian power has 

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:19.750
 announced the return of an old man 

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:22.510
 character the coconut mister is not known 

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:25.750
 no success in the fifth season 

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:27.850
 ok guys for today it's all i salute you 

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:28.780
