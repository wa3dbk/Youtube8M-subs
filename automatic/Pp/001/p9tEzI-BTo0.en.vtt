00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
this tastes like if it has multiple

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.309

layers<00:02:31.310> of<00:02:31.519> smell<00:02:32.090> look<00:02:32.569> at<00:02:32.660> this<00:02:32.780> I<00:02:32.989> mean<00:02:33.079> this

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
layers of smell look at this I mean this

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:34.960 
layers of smell look at this I mean this
but<00:02:33.500> this<00:02:33.680> head<00:02:33.920> stays<00:02:34.190> I<00:02:34.519> mean<00:02:34.700> it's<00:02:34.850> like<00:02:34.910> a

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
but this head stays I mean it's like a

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.699 
but this head stays I mean it's like a
real<00:02:35.239> good<00:02:35.480> quality<00:02:36.069> or<00:02:37.069> not<00:02:37.370> or<00:02:38.329> not<00:02:38.359> we<00:02:39.319> can

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
real good quality or not or not we can

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.640 
real good quality or not or not we can
we<00:02:40.579> can<00:02:40.880> probably<00:02:41.209> the<00:02:41.510> kind<00:02:41.690> of<00:02:41.720> glass<00:02:41.870> that's

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
we can probably the kind of glass that's

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.410 
we can probably the kind of glass that's
why<00:02:42.859> they<00:02:43.069> actually<00:02:43.459> use<00:02:43.609> the<00:02:43.760> faux<00:02:43.940> mason<00:02:44.359> jar

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420
