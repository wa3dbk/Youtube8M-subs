00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:13.490
 draw me a fish to draw a

 fish nothing more simple 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:21.650
 first very curved shaped 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.650
 wave to draw the back of the fish 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.050
 simulate the lips 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.960
 and draws a curve for the bottom of the 

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:45.089
 head it's him the first fins in 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.589
 triangle shape then traces three 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:53.760
 traits inside to make his 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:59.129
 edges then connect the fin to 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:01.170
 beginning of the tail now refers to 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.859
 dorsal fin and trace traits 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.859
 for the stops 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.040
 ed the fish to swim and made him a 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:21.090
 beautiful tail shaped triangle 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.090
 do not forget to make him ridges 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:40.619
 draw a curve to delimit the head 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:46.200
 of the body and trace his branch ea did him 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:47.819
 a fin with a point in the center it does not 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:02:12.660
 you just have to add more 

00:01:47.819 --> 00:02:16.310
 scales on the rest of the body and 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.310
 now you can color it
