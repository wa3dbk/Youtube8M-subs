00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.190 

I<00:01:24.280> think<00:01:24.520> the<00:01:24.880> thing<00:01:25.180> looking<00:01:25.660> forward<00:01:25.990> to<00:01:26.080> the

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
I think the thing looking forward to the

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.430 
I think the thing looking forward to the
losses<00:01:26.620> is<00:01:26.920> our<00:01:27.160> first<00:01:27.370> performance<00:01:27.940> and<00:01:28.440> the

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
losses is our first performance and the

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.200 
losses is our first performance and the
reason<00:01:29.770> is<00:01:29.920> is<00:01:30.130> because<00:01:30.160> the<00:01:30.610> band<00:01:30.850> has<00:01:31.060> been

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
reason is is because the band has been

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.260 
reason is is because the band has been
here<00:01:31.450> for<00:01:31.690> a<00:01:31.930> week<00:01:32.230> already<00:01:32.950> just<00:01:33.610> working<00:01:34.090> day
