haven't been out doing working this hard
but<00:01:54.390> I<00:01:54.900> expect<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.409> lot<00:01:55.530> from<00:01:55.590> this<00:01:55.800> team<00:01:55.980> as<00:01:56.280> a

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
but I expect a lot from this team as a

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:04.600 
but I expect a lot from this team as a
captain

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.430 

kind<00:02:04.850> of<00:02:04.910> carry<00:02:05.150> down<00:02:05.330> the<00:02:05.510> line<00:02:05.660> and<00:02:05.990> I<00:02:06.230> think

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
kind of carry down the line and I think

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.780 
kind of carry down the line and I think
a<00:02:06.620> lot<00:02:06.980> of<00:02:07.010> work<00:02:07.220> was<00:02:07.400> done<00:02:07.490> over<00:02:07.670> the<00:02:07.760> summer

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.890 
a lot of work was done over the summer
