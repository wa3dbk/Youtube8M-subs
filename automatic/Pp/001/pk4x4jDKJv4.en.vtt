00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
speed shop here in lynnwood and i just

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.240 
speed shop here in lynnwood and i just
want<00:00:06.990> to<00:00:07.140> give<00:00:07.200> you<00:00:07.379> guys<00:00:07.410> a<00:00:07.529> quick<00:00:07.890> and<00:00:08.099> dirty

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
want to give you guys a quick and dirty

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.629 
want to give you guys a quick and dirty
idea<00:00:09.030> of<00:00:09.360> my<00:00:09.840> quick<00:00:10.110> and<00:00:10.290> dirty<00:00:10.639> alignment

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
idea of my quick and dirty alignment

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.320 
idea of my quick and dirty alignment
system<00:00:12.269> I<00:00:12.750> made<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:14.610> cool<00:00:14.820> thing<00:00:14.969> about<00:00:15.000> this

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
system I made the cool thing about this

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.269 
system I made the cool thing about this
is<00:00:15.570> it'll<00:00:15.960> get<00:00:16.139> you<00:00:16.260> in<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.410> ballpark<00:00:16.619> pretty

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
is it'll get you in the ballpark pretty

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.420 
is it'll get you in the ballpark pretty
close<00:00:18.080> then<00:00:19.080> having<00:00:19.529> proper<00:00:19.890> alignment<00:00:20.039> will

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
close then having proper alignment will

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.170 
close then having proper alignment will
reduce<00:00:21.060> tire<00:00:21.330> wear<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:21.869> increase<00:00:22.740> handling

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180 
reduce tire wear and increase handling

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.970 
reduce tire wear and increase handling
so<00:00:24.180> basically<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.900> idea<00:00:24.930> here<00:00:25.439> is<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.680> get

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
so basically the idea here is to get

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.130 
so basically the idea here is to get
these<00:00:26.130> two<00:00:26.340> front<00:00:26.640> tires<00:00:26.789> pointed<00:00:27.510> straight

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
these two front tires pointed straight

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.470 
these two front tires pointed straight
forward<00:00:28.310> perfectly<00:00:29.310> parallel<00:00:29.580> when<00:00:30.359> the

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
forward perfectly parallel when the

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.240 
forward perfectly parallel when the
steering<00:00:30.660> wheel<00:00:30.900> is<00:00:31.080> locked<00:00:31.679> in<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.009> center

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
steering wheel is locked in the center

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.299 
steering wheel is locked in the center
position<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.840> way<00:00:33.960> that<00:00:34.170> I've<00:00:34.920> decided

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
position and the way that I've decided

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.970 
position and the way that I've decided
to<00:00:35.430> go<00:00:35.610> about<00:00:35.790> doing<00:00:35.969> that<00:00:36.559> which<00:00:37.559> may<00:00:37.770> not<00:00:37.800> be

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
to go about doing that which may not be

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.950 
to go about doing that which may not be
the<00:00:38.309> best<00:00:38.340> most<00:00:38.910> efficient<00:00:39.420> way<00:00:39.480> or<00:00:39.690> whatever

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
the best most efficient way or whatever

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.450 
the best most efficient way or whatever
it's<00:00:40.170> just<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.500> first<00:00:40.710> idea<00:00:40.920> that<00:00:41.070> came<00:00:41.309> to

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
it's just the first idea that came to

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.830 
it's just the first idea that came to
mind<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:41.879> it<00:00:41.969> seems<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.239> be<00:00:42.300> working<00:00:42.450> pretty

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
mind and it seems to be working pretty

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.049 
mind and it seems to be working pretty
well<00:00:42.960> so<00:00:43.290> far<00:00:43.610> basically<00:00:44.610> I've<00:00:44.700> taken<00:00:44.910> these

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
well so far basically I've taken these

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.779 
well so far basically I've taken these
two<00:00:45.270> pieces<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.719> metal<00:00:45.960> here<00:00:46.640> and<00:00:47.640> I've

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
two pieces of metal here and I've

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.740 
two pieces of metal here and I've
securely<00:00:48.390> zip<00:00:48.660> tied<00:00:48.899> them<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.890> wheel

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
securely zip tied them to the wheel

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.819 
securely zip tied them to the wheel
these<00:00:51.750> are<00:00:51.840> about<00:00:51.930> as<00:00:52.110> tight<00:00:52.289> as<00:00:52.440> I<00:00:52.530> can<00:00:52.590> get

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
these are about as tight as I can get

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.760 
these are about as tight as I can get
them<00:00:52.980> in<00:00:53.100> this<00:00:53.789> metal<00:00:54.300> is<00:00:54.510> actually<00:00:55.289> resting

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
them in this metal is actually resting

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.860 
them in this metal is actually resting
on<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.100> two<00:00:56.309> highest<00:00:56.579> points<00:00:57.120> of<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.300> tire<00:00:57.480> so

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
on the two highest points of the tire so

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.849 
on the two highest points of the tire so
that<00:00:58.469> happens<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:59.039> be<00:00:59.070> this<00:00:59.309> lip<00:00:59.640> right<00:00:59.850> here

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859 
that happens to be this lip right here

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:03.290 
that happens to be this lip right here
so<00:01:01.859> I've<00:01:01.949> made<00:01:02.129> sure<00:01:02.160> that<00:01:02.370> this<00:01:02.670> bar<00:01:03.000> is

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
so I've made sure that this bar is

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.260 
so I've made sure that this bar is
stretched<00:01:04.140> across<00:01:04.350> at<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:04.830> point<00:01:05.129> in<00:01:05.369> that

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
stretched across at that point in that

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.899 
stretched across at that point in that
point<00:01:06.600> right<00:01:06.750> there<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:07.250> that<00:01:08.250> way<00:01:08.760> i<00:01:08.790> can

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
point right there and that way i can

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.000 
point right there and that way i can
assume<00:01:09.360> that<00:01:10.080> this<00:01:10.290> bar<00:01:10.560> is<00:01:10.590> going<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.920> be

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
assume that this bar is going to be

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.340 
assume that this bar is going to be
perfectly<00:01:11.369> parallel<00:01:11.610> with<00:01:12.420> this<00:01:12.630> so<00:01:12.930> these

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
perfectly parallel with this so these

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.969 
perfectly parallel with this so these
are<00:01:13.409> all<00:01:13.560> pretty<00:01:13.770> tight<00:01:15.619> got<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.740> same<00:01:16.950> thing

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
are all pretty tight got the same thing

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.789 
are all pretty tight got the same thing
going<00:01:17.400> on<00:01:17.490> over<00:01:17.729> here<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.409> the<00:01:19.409> way<00:01:19.530> that<00:01:19.650> will

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
going on over here and the way that will

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.030 
going on over here and the way that will
make<00:01:19.979> our<00:01:20.009> adjustments<00:01:20.220> is<00:01:20.880> by<00:01:21.630> rotating<00:01:22.080> the

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
make our adjustments is by rotating the

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.060 
make our adjustments is by rotating the
inner<00:01:23.400> tie<00:01:23.640> rod<00:01:24.110> and<00:01:25.820> and<00:01:26.869> the<00:01:27.869> key<00:01:28.080> thing<00:01:28.320> make

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
inner tie rod and and the key thing make

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.590 
inner tie rod and and the key thing make
sure<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.460> your<00:01:29.549> steering<00:01:29.880> wheel<00:01:29.970> is<00:01:30.329> locked

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
sure that your steering wheel is locked

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.050 
sure that your steering wheel is locked
in<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.229> center<00:01:31.470> position<00:01:31.820> since<00:01:32.820> we<00:01:32.970> don't

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
in the center position since we don't

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.300 
in the center position since we don't
have<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.270> lock<00:01:33.570> right<00:01:33.600> now<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:34.290> just<00:01:34.650> have<00:01:35.100> to

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
have a lock right now I just have to

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.010 
have a lock right now I just have to
keep<00:01:35.460> checking<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.180> make<00:01:36.210> sure<00:01:36.540> that<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:36.869> is

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
keep checking it to make sure that it is

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.749 
keep checking it to make sure that it is
centered<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.530> I'd<00:01:37.680> say<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.159> pretty<00:01:38.610> much<00:01:38.729> is

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
centered and I'd say it pretty much is

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.670 
centered and I'd say it pretty much is
right<00:01:39.150> there<00:01:39.860> and<00:01:40.860> basically<00:01:41.250> what<00:01:41.640> we<00:01:41.729> do<00:01:42.150> is

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
right there and basically what we do is

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.260 
right there and basically what we do is
we<00:01:43.680> use<00:01:43.829> a<00:01:43.860> tape<00:01:44.130> measure<00:01:44.340> we're<00:01:45.090> going<00:01:45.180> to

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
we use a tape measure we're going to

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.950 
we use a tape measure we're going to
pick<00:01:45.600> two<00:01:45.810> points<00:01:47.659> and<00:01:48.659> we're<00:01:48.780> going<00:01:48.899> to

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
pick two points and we're going to

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.870 
pick two points and we're going to
measure<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.500> distance<00:01:49.920> between<00:01:50.189> these<00:01:50.820> two

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
measure the distance between these two

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.719 
measure the distance between these two
bars<00:01:51.270> at<00:01:51.509> those<00:01:51.810> two<00:01:52.020> points<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.530> once<00:01:53.490> those

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
bars at those two points and once those

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.950 
bars at those two points and once those
measurements<00:01:54.630> are<00:01:55.590> equal<00:01:56.579> then<00:01:57.540> we'll<00:01:57.780> know

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
measurements are equal then we'll know

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.080 
measurements are equal then we'll know
that<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.320> two<00:01:58.500> bars<00:01:58.740> are<00:01:59.040> perfectly<00:01:59.820> parallel

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
that the two bars are perfectly parallel

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.240 
that the two bars are perfectly parallel
and<00:02:00.420> when<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.200> bars<00:02:01.409> are<00:02:01.500> parallel<00:02:01.950> we<00:02:02.070> can

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
and when the bars are parallel we can

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.459 
and when the bars are parallel we can
assume<00:02:02.490> that<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:03.119> tires<00:02:03.329> are<00:02:03.570> also<00:02:03.750> perfectly

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
assume that the tires are also perfectly

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:10.180 
assume that the tires are also perfectly
parallel<00:02:04.909> so<00:02:05.909> you<00:02:06.540> can<00:02:06.689> see<00:02:06.899> right<00:02:06.930> here

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.100 

the<00:02:11.190> 81<00:02:11.700> and<00:02:11.790> a<00:02:11.880> quarter<00:02:12.150> mark<00:02:12.390> is<00:02:12.540> right<00:02:12.990> in

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
the 81 and a quarter mark is right in

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.840 
the 81 and a quarter mark is right in
the<00:02:13.170> middle<00:02:13.380> of<00:02:13.590> this<00:02:13.830> dip<00:02:14.190> in<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.459> bar<00:02:14.640> right

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
the middle of this dip in the bar right

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.180 
the middle of this dip in the bar right
here<00:02:14.880> so<00:02:15.390> we're<00:02:15.540> going<00:02:15.630> to<00:02:15.720> check<00:02:15.959> to<00:02:15.990> see<00:02:16.190> down

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
here so we're going to check to see down

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.240 
here so we're going to check to see down
here<00:02:17.370> at<00:02:17.490> the<00:02:17.520> end<00:02:17.760> of<00:02:17.880> the<00:02:17.970> bar<00:02:18.950> if<00:02:19.950> we<00:02:20.130> have

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
here at the end of the bar if we have

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.790 
here at the end of the bar if we have
the<00:02:20.370> same<00:02:20.580> results<00:02:21.090> and<00:02:21.300> I've<00:02:22.260> kind<00:02:22.590> of<00:02:22.680> gone

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
the same results and I've kind of gone

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.920 
the same results and I've kind of gone
back<00:02:23.069> and<00:02:23.220> forth<00:02:23.310> and<00:02:23.670> adjusted<00:02:24.120> bees<00:02:24.300> and<00:02:24.569> i'm

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
back and forth and adjusted bees and i'm

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.800 
back and forth and adjusted bees and i'm
pretty<00:02:25.230> sure<00:02:25.500> that<00:02:25.740> we're<00:02:26.010> there<00:02:26.340> right<00:02:26.970> now

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:42.640 

and<00:02:31.310> see<00:02:33.680> i<00:02:37.190> would<00:02:38.190> say<00:02:38.520> that's<00:02:38.760> perfect

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.130 

so<00:02:43.489> you<00:02:44.000> can<00:02:44.090> kind<00:02:44.269> of<00:02:44.299> see<00:02:44.450> what<00:02:44.599> what<00:02:45.049> I've

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
so you can kind of see what what I've

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.399 
so you can kind of see what what I've
