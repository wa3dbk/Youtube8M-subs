into that I'm gonna load up my LP world
here<00:05:47.940> it<00:05:48.030> is<00:05:48.150> and<00:05:48.420> as<00:05:48.840> you<00:05:48.930> can<00:05:49.020> see<00:05:49.170> it<00:05:49.230> works

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
here it is and as you can see it works

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.920 
here it is and as you can see it works
it's<00:05:49.950> the<00:05:50.460> sprint<00:05:50.760> doesn't<00:05:51.120> work<00:05:51.330> extremely

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
it's the sprint doesn't work extremely

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:56.360 
it's the sprint doesn't work extremely
well<00:05:52.340> I<00:05:53.340> can<00:05:53.880> it's<00:05:54.480> sort<00:05:54.900> of<00:05:54.930> hard<00:05:55.140> to<00:05:55.290> do<00:05:55.500> the

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
well I can it's sort of hard to do the

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:57.860 
well I can it's sort of hard to do the
movements<00:05:56.880> are<00:05:56.970> a<00:05:57.000> little<00:05:57.120> bit<00:05:57.300> jittery<00:05:57.480> so

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:57.870 
movements are a little bit jittery so

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.750 
movements are a little bit jittery so
unless<00:05:58.140> you<00:05:58.290> don't<00:05:58.470> mind<00:05:58.740> that<00:05:58.830> it's<00:05:59.580> not

00:05:59.750 --> 00:05:59.760 
unless you don't mind that it's not

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.000 
unless you don't mind that it's not
quite<00:05:59.970> as<00:06:00.090> smooth<00:06:00.240> as<00:06:00.330> the<00:06:00.450> Xbox<00:06:00.660> addition<00:06:01.170> to

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.010 
quite as smooth as the Xbox addition to

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:05.270 
quite as smooth as the Xbox addition to
when<00:06:02.820> you<00:06:02.970> shift<00:06:03.420> as<00:06:03.870> if<00:06:04.320> if<00:06:04.590> you're<00:06:04.830> shifting

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280 
when you shift as if if you're shifting

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.490 
when you shift as if if you're shifting
you're<00:06:05.550> sprinting<00:06:05.790> it<00:06:06.600> actually<00:06:06.900> holds<00:06:07.200> it

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:07.500 
you're sprinting it actually holds it

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.830 
you're sprinting it actually holds it
down<00:06:07.530> so<00:06:08.520> which<00:06:08.760> is<00:06:08.910> sort<00:06:09.090> of<00:06:09.150> good<00:06:09.390> instead<00:06:09.780> of

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:09.840 
down so which is sort of good instead of

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.740 
down so which is sort of good instead of
just<00:06:09.930> constant<00:06:10.440> havin<00:06:10.620> to<00:06:10.680> hold<00:06:10.830> it<00:06:10.950> down<00:06:11.750> but

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:12.750 
just constant havin to hold it down but

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:15.170 
just constant havin to hold it down but
it<00:06:13.230> still<00:06:13.470> works<00:06:13.710> it's<00:06:14.010> just<00:06:14.190> not<00:06:14.400> as<00:06:14.670> smooth

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.180 
it still works it's just not as smooth

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.990 
it still works it's just not as smooth
as<00:06:15.420> you'd<00:06:15.660> probably<00:06:15.690> want<00:06:16.290> it<00:06:16.500> to<00:06:16.620> be<00:06:16.770> but<00:06:17.760> just

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 
as you'd probably want it to be but just

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.600 
as you'd probably want it to be but just
for<00:06:18.150> a<00:06:18.180> novelty<00:06:18.510> it's<00:06:18.840> quite<00:06:19.110> cool<00:06:19.370> of<00:06:20.370> course
