00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:10.920
 occasion I bring you how to make a tea 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.590
 homemade lemon and good for this 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.730
 we need 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:18.440
 a small lemon if this is for a 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.200
 cup then we need a lemon 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:24.700
 small if it's from the big lemons 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:28.420
 half lemon sugar 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:31.720
 honey can be more can be bee and 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:34.410
 we go to pure water of course and to 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:37.410
 do it we're going to be a little pot 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.410
 so 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.850
 let say 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:45.989
 this pure water you can serve it in 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:51.600
 his house then is forbidden I have it 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.600
 then we are going to take a low 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.400
 then we take a cup and that cup 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.800
 we are going to add the water to measure 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.070
 more or less the rate that we're going to 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.070
 drink 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.000
 let's fill the cup of water 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:19.270
 the rest and we will warn the girlfriend not 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:21.759
 just to have the measure of the tea that 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.590
 will leave us and we will add a 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:26.920
 little bit because they remember how we are going to 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.980
 connect the water is going to consume a 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.720
 little bit 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.080
 good 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:36.550
 since we have our water 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:38.380
 the exact measurement for our for 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.350
 our tape with the preaching cup 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.250
 let's take we're going to take a 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.500
 knife 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:50.030
 the seeds to us 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.030
 let's go to lemon 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:59.220
 and let's have lemon 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:02.000
 in the water we are going to dilute it 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.000
 perfect 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.900
 we dilute it and go 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:13.420
 the seeds 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.150
 or the nuggets as they want to tell you 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.640
 and we're going to then grab the 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.120
 peel a lemon and let's leave it 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.120
 in 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.000
 this shell is if we do not throw we're going to 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:30.420
 Trow it to the trash 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.310
 you have to have the kitchen clean then 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:38.340
 we already miss what is the 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.890
 lemon liquid the lemon juice 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.220
 Y 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.300
 the water and then we are going to subtract 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.520
 the sugar 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.819
 to start this we are going to throw him 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.790

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:55.210

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:58.620
 a spoon full of sugar 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:03.340
 let's leave it here and let's give it 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:06.400
 a spoonful of honey I repeat it can 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:10.230
 bee honey can be neither the maple 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.230
 any of the two thousand 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.290
 we already have our scoop 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.470
 leave here let's touch the number the 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.470
 honey 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.970
 very good then 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.470
 let's stay 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.470
 to mix them a little 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.260
 do not 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:46.909
 the honey inside him 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:50.430
 the water that we made with our and we're going 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:54.180
 to cover and put it 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:57.000
 in the stove good stove where as 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.700
 you tell me and we are going to wait for 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.200
 hot totally then we go back 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.450
 good since we are here in our 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.350
 burner we are going to put on medium heat 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.230
 here we want what 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:11.320
 it warms up a lot this is a little more 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.320
 Quick 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:16.010
 and we are going to close it then we are going to 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.980
 wait there until it reaches 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.989
 boiling or if you do not want it 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.540
 hot we will remove before 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.700
 then let's wait and let's see 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.230
 How good is friends since 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:31.660
 our 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:31.660
 Enough calientito 

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:37.000
 all right 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.770
 let's take a colander a small 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.060
 strainer 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:44.530
 and we're going 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.530
 to throw in our cup 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.040
 and let's go 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.790
 remove this here 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.710
 if you do not have a colander it does not matter what 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:01.500
 they can let them go and they only take away 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:03.500
 the lemon before and let's take a little 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:07.450
 of sugar 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.450
 and a spoonful but also 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:13.400
 the hand 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:15.620
 and we are going to throw sugar to him because to me 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.560
 I like it 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:25.510
 2 so we're going to take it as we fight 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:25.510
 a spoonful of sweet bread 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:33.230
 forgive a spoonful of more or half 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.230
 spoonful and let's regulate 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:41.440
 and well there we have our tea 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:44.529
 homemade lemon will see that it is a theme 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:47.260
 very good very good natural 

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:49.900
 and the only thing that maybe 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:52.480
 we will get fat so that people 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:55.570
 so that people who are taking care of themselves 

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:57.190
 the line then the only thing that is going to 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.009
 fattening is the amount of sugar the 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:00.749
 can replace 

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:02.990
 when it is already served you can 

00:06:00.749 --> 00:06:08.069
 replace with one and when for these 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:10.139
 sachets that are made of synthetic sugar 

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:13.710
 I recommend you throw it synthetic to the 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:16.460
 time to see the pp well because it is not going to 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:18.809
 leaving the same is not the same then in 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.879
 are you the lemon you have made at home and 

00:06:18.809 --> 00:06:23.719
 I hope you like them and will to 

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:23.719
 next chao
