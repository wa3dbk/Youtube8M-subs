00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.400
 welcome to yesterday first boss of 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:18.259
 summer of eternal spring 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.480
 protectors of eternity in this 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:23.240
 videoguÃ­a we will explain the elite way of 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.270
 this meeting we will need two tanks 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.400
 three genes and five of weight 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.800
 the difference between the normal mode and 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.380
 ite resides when choosing the kill order 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.680
 the ancestors being the elite mode in the 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.540
 what they cause is the last living protector 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.360
 in this case we will kill first the 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.460
 ancestor regal and then to sanz and you have to 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.770
 know that the areas here are of little use 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.220
 since when a protector dies the 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.620
 rest heals in all his life 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.500
 with the three living ancestors we have 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.240
 several skills to solve 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.070
 talking about catching an innate tank and the 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:00.070
 which should cure the touch of the tsja 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.200
 that praise with watering the other tank 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.040
 will take it in agriculture and whenever possible 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.680
 his discharge of lightning will be cut off 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.780
 the pressure of licorice lightning to 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.610
 two relational players who must 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.790
 get away from the band and they should be 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.370
 shot of crossan spears and goes free 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.530
 of water we will try to be separated 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.810
 between all since your water discharge 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.800
 inflicts damage to the target and all 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.010
 that are three meters away from him 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.660
 your furnace attack is purifying water 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.880
 when they make them appear in a puddle of 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:33.670
 water on the ground and both players and 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.980
 ancestors if they stay in it they will get 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.560
 a debut with which they will cure 5% of 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.690
 your life every sumiendo is very important 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.150
 that without watering is in this case the focus 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.700
 they have it, the moment takes off 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:48.220
 those of weights like this we will continue the 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.530
 fight until you give away the arrears after your 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.870
 death one of the tanks will catch each 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.580
 wave and will be turning them around for 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:58.000
 to leave the skill outside the center 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:00.250
 new that gains soil that has been tainted when passing 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.050
 above the tank you will receive a charge 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.570
 that will make the soil damage sullied 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.250
 increase on the other side 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.110
 will remain in the center of the room 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.030
 Away from each other 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.310
 with the new skill that wins Sanz and 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.770
 a water balloon called waters will appear 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.470
 corrupt that should be eliminated in 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.960
 when they leave since it gives 50% of 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.910
 Haste to Shanik or once it's over 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.070
 with the corrupt waters the center of 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.590
 floor will light up and we'll get during 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:29.709
 a few seconds the purifying effect that 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.960
 will increase our celerity 25% is 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.490
 important in this phase 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:36.190
 fight the purified waters of asan and 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:38.410
 when he gets them to him once he dies 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.450
 sam and the whole range and heller will come together 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.270
 to be able to heal in areas that started 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.130
 a career of ps against holland in this 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.800
 case the our skill called 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.110
 expel corruption leaving a cloud of 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.030
 30 meter corruption that will remove 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.610
 very much life every second and a half 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:57.520
 now the tank without soil marks 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.200
 tarnished will catch flow and will change 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.020
 the tanks when you restart your 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.550
 marks, the ideal is that the scrum 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.890
 move before it appears when you press 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.630
 corruption to prevent further damage and it 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.740
 will take the edge here hollande to 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.750
 keep doing dps 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:14.000
 it is important to know what to expel 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.280
 corruption will not disappear until 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.570
 end the fight which will cause if 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.640
 we are well placed clouds of 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:22.400
 corruption we will remain without salting and 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.150
 we will die for the rest will be dps and 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.159
 end with kabul 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.709
 once finished with the protectors of 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:30.420
 eternity will lower your canvas the room and 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.750
 we will be prepared to fight against 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.519
 the 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.670
 good luck and see you in the next 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.670
 guide
