00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:26.539 
you can see how when we go inside yeah

that's the thing okay so that's some of
the<00:00:30.210> key<00:00:30.480> out<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:31.219> we<00:00:32.219> will<00:00:32.399> be<00:00:32.579> using<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:33.059> app

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
Geekbench ass to benchmark i'll be

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.389 
Geekbench ass to benchmark i'll be
making<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.969> speed<00:00:39.360> up<00:00:39.510> test<00:00:40.170> video<00:00:40.530> putting

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
making a speed up test video putting

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.340 
making a speed up test video putting
them<00:00:41.520> up<00:00:41.700> but<00:00:41.910> if<00:00:42.149> you<00:00:42.239> want<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.540> have<00:00:42.660> separate

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
them up but if you want to have separate

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.500 
them up but if you want to have separate
different<00:00:43.559> videos<00:00:44.070> then<00:00:44.489> yeah<00:00:44.820> whatever<00:00:45.270> i

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
different videos then yeah whatever i

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.900 
different videos then yeah whatever i
guess<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.079> air<00:00:46.200> i<00:00:46.230> think<00:00:46.590> for<00:00:46.770> us<00:00:46.890> at<00:00:47.160> the

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
guess the air i think for us at the

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.229 
guess the air i think for us at the
iphone<00:00:48.239> 5<00:00:48.480> I<00:00:48.840> need<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.950> option<00:00:50.219> for<00:00:50.489> fun<00:00:51.210> on

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
iphone 5 I need the option for fun on

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.720 
iphone 5 I need the option for fun on
your<00:00:51.510> phone<00:00:51.870> or<00:00:52.110> may<00:00:52.350> about<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.739> ram<00:00:53.010> same<00:00:53.399> here

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
your phone or may about to ram same here

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.029 
your phone or may about to ram same here
I<00:00:53.879> mean<00:00:54.300> they<00:00:54.600> kind<00:00:54.719> of<00:00:54.809> like<00:00:54.960> TFM<00:00:55.440> for<00:00:55.649> us<00:00:55.770> it

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
I mean they kind of like TFM for us it

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.430 
I mean they kind of like TFM for us it
is<00:00:56.250> like<00:00:56.940> asking<00:00:57.180> for<00:00:57.570> but<00:00:57.780> with<00:00:58.020> an<00:00:58.140> extra

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
is like asking for but with an extra

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.279 
is like asking for but with an extra
core<00:00:58.910> and<00:00:59.910> it<00:01:00.539> really<00:01:00.899> makes<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.260> difference

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
core and it really makes a difference

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.740 
core and it really makes a difference
you<00:01:01.710> really<00:01:02.190> really<00:01:02.520> really<00:01:02.730> makes<00:01:03.600> a

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
you really really really makes a

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.780 
you really really really makes a
difference<00:01:03.780> you<00:01:04.500> can<00:01:04.860> see<00:01:05.070> our<00:01:05.159> apple<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.549> for

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
difference you can see our apple a for

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.510 
difference you can see our apple a for
Apple<00:01:06.060> a5<00:01:06.180> 800<00:01:07.140> megahertz<00:01:07.350> still<00:01:07.740> clock<00:01:08.130> at

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
Apple a5 800 megahertz still clock at

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.880 
Apple a5 800 megahertz still clock at
the<00:01:08.640> processor<00:01:09.119> but<00:01:09.330> one<00:01:09.540> extra<00:01:09.869> core<00:01:10.260> really

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
the processor but one extra core really

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.830 
the processor but one extra core really
makes<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.280> experience<00:01:11.460> so<00:01:11.970> much<00:01:12.150> more<00:01:12.420> smooth

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
makes the experience so much more smooth

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.859 
makes the experience so much more smooth
overall<00:01:13.619> in<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.670> performance<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.360> then<00:01:15.750> we

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
overall in the performance and then we

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.960 
overall in the performance and then we
do<00:01:15.990> have<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.259> iphone<00:01:16.560> 5<00:01:16.799> with<00:01:17.640> twice<00:01:17.939> the

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
do have the iphone 5 with twice the

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.420 
do have the iphone 5 with twice the
amount<00:01:18.240> of<00:01:18.509> ram<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:18.960> then<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.770> dual<00:01:20.100> core

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
amount of ram and then a dual core

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.080 
amount of ram and then a dual core
processor<00:01:20.990> clocked<00:01:21.990> at<00:01:22.310> 1.3<00:01:23.310> hurts<00:01:23.729> instead

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
processor clocked at 1.3 hurts instead

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.050 
processor clocked at 1.3 hurts instead
of<00:01:24.270> autonomy<00:01:24.840> hurts<00:01:25.049> okay<00:01:25.710> let's<00:01:26.250> run<00:01:26.640> this

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
of autonomy hurts okay let's run this

00:01:27.060 --> 00:02:19.420 
of autonomy hurts okay let's run this
test<00:01:27.570> yeah<00:01:31.220> I'm<00:01:32.220> sorry<00:01:32.430> if<00:01:32.549> I<00:01:32.640> piss<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:32.850> off

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
to wait here until the iphone 44s also

00:02:44.650 --> 00:03:44.690 
to wait here until the iphone 44s also
will<00:02:44.830> finish<00:02:45.070> up

iphone 4 sub square out 714 on the

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.380 
iphone 4 sub square out 714 on the
emotional<00:03:57.720> core<00:03:58.340> duo<00:03:59.340> core<00:03:59.700> score<00:04:00.000> of<00:04:00.090> course

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
emotional core duo core score of course

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.830 
emotional core duo core score of course
here<00:04:00.989> it<00:04:01.650> will<00:04:01.860> add<00:04:02.010> up<00:04:02.190> of<00:04:02.400> course<00:04:02.760> and<00:04:03.180> both

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
here it will add up of course and both

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.440 
here it will add up of course and both
course<00:04:04.230> should<00:04:04.860> be<00:04:05.220> about<00:04:05.489> the<00:04:05.819> same<00:04:06.000> kind<00:04:06.269> of

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
course should be about the same kind of

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.040 
course should be about the same kind of
power<00:04:07.140> inside<00:04:07.950> of<00:04:08.010> them<00:04:08.250> let's<00:04:09.000> see<00:04:09.120> here<00:04:09.300> if

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
power inside of them let's see here if

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:18.830 
power inside of them let's see here if
you<00:04:10.230> take<00:04:12.590> 714<00:04:13.590> times<00:04:13.950> two<00:04:16.370> 14-28<00:04:17.370> ok<00:04:17.729> so<00:04:17.840> so

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
you take 714 times two 14-28 ok so so

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.449 
you take 714 times two 14-28 ok so so
one<00:04:19.049> of<00:04:19.079> those<00:04:19.320> cores<00:04:19.680> are<00:04:19.950> a<00:04:19.979> little<00:04:20.310> bit

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
one of those cores are a little bit

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:51.610 
one of those cores are a little bit
weaker<00:04:20.959> yeah<00:04:23.220> happen<00:04:23.580> sometimes

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.350 

okay<00:04:52.620> we're<00:04:52.800> getting<00:04:52.889> to<00:04:53.159> school<00:04:53.279> now<00:04:53.580> also<00:04:54.240> on

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
okay we're getting to school now also on

00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:05.570 
okay we're getting to school now also on
a<00:04:54.389> lot<00:04:54.659> of<00:04:54.809> ice

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:11.130 

white<00:05:06.580> so<00:05:08.250> there<00:05:09.250> is<00:05:09.280> very<00:05:10.000> difference<00:05:10.540> here

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:11.140 
white so there is very difference here

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.910 
white so there is very difference here
between<00:05:11.380> you<00:05:12.280> having<00:05:12.520> five<00:05:12.730> and<00:05:13.050> e4s<00:05:14.050> as<00:05:14.560> well

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:14.920 
between you having five and e4s as well

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:19.310 
between you having five and e4s as well
I<00:05:15.190> mean<00:05:16.030> wow<00:05:16.270> I<00:05:16.710> think<00:05:17.710> that<00:05:17.770> they<00:05:18.010> made<00:05:18.340> around

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
I mean wow I think that they made around

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:24.060 
I mean wow I think that they made around
a<00:05:20.820> 50-percent<00:05:21.820> speed<00:05:22.750> bump<00:05:23.020> or<00:05:23.230> something<00:05:23.590> or

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.070 
a 50-percent speed bump or something or

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.220 
a 50-percent speed bump or something or
maybe<00:05:24.190> one<00:05:24.610> on<00:05:24.760> some<00:05:25.030> speed<00:05:25.300> on<00:05:25.480> between<00:05:25.870> the

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:26.230 
maybe one on some speed on between the

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.830 
maybe one on some speed on between the
for<00:05:26.650> us<00:05:26.770> and<00:05:27.250> they<00:05:27.460> often<00:05:27.580> follow<00:05:27.910> me<00:05:28.120> look<00:05:28.690> at

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
for us and they often follow me look at

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.040 
for us and they often follow me look at
this<00:05:28.930> this<00:05:29.290> is<00:05:29.350> pretty<00:05:30.100> insane<00:05:30.720> just<00:05:31.720> because

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
this this is pretty insane just because

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.020 
this this is pretty insane just because
I<00:05:32.290> mean<00:05:32.440> first<00:05:33.010> of<00:05:33.130> all<00:05:33.220> it's<00:05:33.520> the<00:05:33.760> same<00:05:33.910> time

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030 
I mean first of all it's the same time

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:36.570 
I mean first of all it's the same time
dual<00:05:34.300> core<00:05:34.720> but<00:05:35.500> its<00:05:35.680> high<00:05:35.770> clock<00:05:36.100> to<00:05:36.250> me<00:05:36.370> wait

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
dual core but its high clock to me wait

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.370 
dual core but its high clock to me wait
hard<00:05:36.760> loss<00:05:36.970> one<00:05:37.540> point<00:05:37.780> three<00:05:37.840> gigahertz

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
hard loss one point three gigahertz

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.740 
hard loss one point three gigahertz
instead<00:05:38.860> of<00:05:38.950> 800<00:05:39.220> megahertz<00:05:39.520> that's<00:05:40.030> 500

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750 
instead of 800 megahertz that's 500

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.800 
instead of 800 megahertz that's 500
megahertz<00:05:41.160> increase<00:05:42.160> and<00:05:42.430> if<00:05:42.940> we<00:05:43.180> add<00:05:43.480> it<00:05:43.510> up

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
megahertz increase and if we add it up

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.280 
megahertz increase and if we add it up
it's<00:05:44.050> a<00:05:44.260> 1<00:05:45.190> gigahertz<00:05:45.690> increase<00:05:46.690> their<00:05:47.020> in

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:47.290 
it's a 1 gigahertz increase their in

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:50.670 
it's a 1 gigahertz increase their in
power<00:05:48.070> and<00:05:48.720> that<00:05:49.720> will<00:05:49.930> really<00:05:50.290> make<00:05:50.440> a

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:50.680 
power and that will really make a

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.650 
power and that will really make a
difference<00:05:51.040> once<00:05:51.700> you<00:05:51.970> start<00:05:52.270> to<00:05:52.330> add

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:52.660 
difference once you start to add

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.020 
difference once you start to add
everything<00:05:53.080> up<00:05:53.500> you<00:05:54.160> can<00:05:54.400> see<00:05:54.520> you<00:05:54.610> get<00:05:54.790> triple

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:55.030 
everything up you can see you get triple

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.340 
everything up you can see you get triple
the<00:05:55.390> score<00:05:55.750> here<00:05:55.980> of<00:05:56.980> the<00:05:57.190> single<00:05:57.580> core<00:05:57.850> and

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:58.350 
the score here of the single core and

the score here of the single core and
multi-core<00:05:59.350> score<00:05:59.500> here<00:06:00.010> is<00:06:00.130> almost<00:06:01.020> four

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:02.020 
multi-core score here is almost four

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:06.450 
multi-core score here is almost four
times<00:06:02.080> the<00:06:02.710> amount<00:06:03.330> it's<00:06:04.330> pretty<00:06:04.600> insane<00:06:05.460> it's

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:06.460 
times the amount it's pretty insane it's

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:15.170 
times the amount it's pretty insane it's
pretty<00:06:06.730> intense<00:06:08.640> pretty<00:06:09.640> awesome

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.180 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.000 

and<00:06:16.180> we<00:06:16.330> having<00:06:16.630> for<00:06:16.900> its<00:06:17.260> going<00:06:17.710> to<00:06:17.770> struggle

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.010 
and we having for its going to struggle

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:20.760 
and we having for its going to struggle
a<00:06:18.190> little<00:06:18.310> bit<00:06:18.460> because<00:06:19.330> so<00:06:19.900> many<00:06:19.990> single<00:06:20.530> core

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:20.770 
a little bit because so many single core

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:38.520 
a little bit because so many single core
800<00:06:21.520> megahertz<00:06:21.850> oh<00:06:22.270> my<00:06:22.960> god<00:06:37.350> also<00:06:38.350> remember

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:38.530 
800 megahertz oh my god also remember

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:39.630 
800 megahertz oh my god also remember
that<00:06:38.680> this<00:06:38.860> is<00:06:38.920> probably<00:06:39.160> the<00:06:39.400> heaviest

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:39.640 
that this is probably the heaviest

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:44.930 
that this is probably the heaviest
geekbench<00:06:40.390> test<00:06:40.840> because<00:06:41.740> it's<00:06:41.920> the<00:06:42.330> ps3

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:44.940 
geekbench test because it's the ps3

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:48.000 
geekbench test because it's the ps3
sender<00:06:45.940> versions<00:06:46.360> before<00:06:46.570> that<00:06:46.930> but<00:06:47.200> hey<00:06:47.350> this

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:48.010 
sender versions before that but hey this

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:57.300 
sender versions before that but hey this
is<00:06:48.160> probably<00:06:48.460> the<00:06:48.580> heaviest<00:06:48.760> one<00:06:55.980> okay<00:06:56.980> so<00:06:57.070> get

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:57.310 
is probably the heaviest one okay so get

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:00.090 
is probably the heaviest one okay so get
the<00:06:57.490> score<00:06:57.730> here<00:06:57.760> and<00:06:58.500> this<00:06:59.500> is<00:06:59.560> pretty<00:06:59.800> fun<00:07:00.040> I

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:00.100 
the score here and this is pretty fun I

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:03.060 
the score here and this is pretty fun I
mean<00:07:00.340> Signal<00:07:01.060> Corps<00:07:01.240> score<00:07:01.570> is<00:07:01.930> almost<00:07:02.200> I<00:07:02.800> mean

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:03.070 
mean Signal Corps score is almost I mean

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:04.590 
mean Signal Corps score is almost I mean
it's<00:07:03.250> kind<00:07:03.580> of<00:07:03.640> like<00:07:03.730> identical<00:07:04.270> to<00:07:04.510> the

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:04.600 
it's kind of like identical to the

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.320 
it's kind of like identical to the
iphone<00:07:04.870> 4s<00:07:05.340> but<00:07:06.340> just<00:07:06.550> because<00:07:06.640> you<00:07:06.970> have<00:07:07.150> that

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:07.330 
iphone 4s but just because you have that

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:10.080 
iphone 4s but just because you have that
extra<00:07:07.660> core<00:07:08.080> inside<00:07:08.830> of<00:07:09.010> the<00:07:09.100> iphone<00:07:09.400> 4s<00:07:09.790> you

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:10.090 
extra core inside of the iphone 4s you

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:12.300 
extra core inside of the iphone 4s you
can<00:07:10.270> get<00:07:10.450> a<00:07:10.480> super<00:07:11.020> smooth<00:07:11.260> experience<00:07:11.680> many

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:12.310 
can get a super smooth experience many

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:15.120 
can get a super smooth experience many
times<00:07:12.640> menus<00:07:13.420> and<00:07:13.660> everything<00:07:14.080> compared<00:07:15.040> to

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:15.130 
times menus and everything compared to

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:19.290 
times menus and everything compared to
the<00:07:15.280> iphone<00:07:15.400> 4<00:07:16.860> so<00:07:17.860> you<00:07:18.670> can<00:07:18.790> see<00:07:18.880> a<00:07:18.910> multi-core

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:19.300 
the iphone 4 so you can see a multi-core
