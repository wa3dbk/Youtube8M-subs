to the ground we collect an enormous

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.650 
to the ground we collect an enormous
amount<00:03:08.250> of<00:03:08.280> data<00:03:08.459> out<00:03:08.730> in<00:03:08.940> space<00:03:09.180> we<00:03:09.450> need<00:03:09.510> to

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
amount of data out in space we need to

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.090 
amount of data out in space we need to
get<00:03:09.780> it<00:03:09.840> all<00:03:09.959> to<00:03:10.080> the<00:03:10.170> ground<00:03:10.410> and<00:03:10.650> so<00:03:10.770> this<00:03:10.950> is

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
get it all to the ground and so this is

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.190 
get it all to the ground and so this is
an<00:03:11.190> alternative<00:03:11.790> that's<00:03:12.360> much<00:03:12.570> faster<00:03:12.600> than

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
an alternative that's much faster than

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.840 
an alternative that's much faster than
our<00:03:13.290> traditional<00:03:13.380> radio<00:03:13.950> waves<00:03:14.190> we<00:03:14.430> used<00:03:14.760> to

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
our traditional radio waves we used to

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.310 
our traditional radio waves we used to
communicate<00:03:15.209> to<00:03:15.300> the<00:03:15.390> ground<00:03:15.600> and<00:03:15.870> so<00:03:16.170> with

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
communicate to the ground and so with

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.630 
communicate to the ground and so with
this<00:03:16.410> demonstration<00:03:16.890> we're<00:03:17.250> paving<00:03:17.430> the<00:03:17.580> way

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
this demonstration we're paving the way

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.550 
this demonstration we're paving the way
for<00:03:17.730> the<00:03:17.940> future<00:03:18.239> of<00:03:18.480> communications<00:03:19.080> to<00:03:19.470> and

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
for the future of communications to and

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.949 
for the future of communications to and
from<00:03:19.680> space<00:03:20.060> so<00:03:21.060> we<00:03:21.150> have<00:03:21.239> a<00:03:21.269> special<00:03:21.540> message

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
from space so we have a special message

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.570 
from space so we have a special message
now<00:03:22.140> from<00:03:22.410> the<00:03:22.470> International<00:03:22.950> Space<00:03:22.980> Station

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
now from the International Space Station

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.640 
now from the International Space Station
it's<00:03:23.790> our<00:03:24.180> first<00:03:24.480> video<00:03:24.720> called<00:03:25.320> hello<00:03:25.620> world
