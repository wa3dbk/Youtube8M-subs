of people just think bread and pasta

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.500 
of people just think bread and pasta
when<00:00:49.530> they<00:00:49.649> think<00:00:49.920> carbs<00:00:50.370> when<00:00:50.850> really<00:00:51.180> fruits

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
when they think carbs when really fruits

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.910 
when they think carbs when really fruits
and<00:00:51.690> vegetables<00:00:52.230> can<00:00:52.469> give<00:00:52.649> you<00:00:52.770> the

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
and vegetables can give you the

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.700 
and vegetables can give you the
carbohydrates<00:00:53.670> that<00:00:53.790> you<00:00:54.000> need<00:00:54.210> as<00:00:54.420> well<00:00:54.710> so

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
carbohydrates that you need as well so

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.920 
carbohydrates that you need as well so
when<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:56.010> eat<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.280> carbohydrate<00:00:57.180> your<00:00:57.660> body

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
when you eat a carbohydrate your body

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.080 
when you eat a carbohydrate your body
takes<00:00:58.440> them<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:58.950> breaks<00:00:59.309> them<00:00:59.520> down<00:00:59.579> and

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
takes them and breaks them down and

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.170 
takes them and breaks them down and
create<00:01:00.600> glucose<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:02.250> need<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.489> glucose

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
create glucose and you need that glucose

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.719 
create glucose and you need that glucose
in<00:01:03.420> your<00:01:03.690> blood<00:01:03.750> in<00:01:04.379> order<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.100> function<00:01:05.339> well

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
in your blood in order to function well

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.420 
in your blood in order to function well
it<00:01:06.420> also<00:01:06.750> takes<00:01:07.170> these<00:01:07.410> carbohydrates<00:01:07.830> and

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
it also takes these carbohydrates and

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.389 
it also takes these carbohydrates and
stores<00:01:08.819> it<00:01:08.910> as<00:01:09.360> energy<00:01:10.080> in<00:01:10.319> your<00:01:10.560> liver<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:10.979> in

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:11.399 
stores it as energy in your liver and in

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:13.760 
stores it as energy in your liver and in
your<00:01:11.580> muscles<00:01:11.759> so<00:01:12.479> if<00:01:12.600> you<00:01:12.750> exercise<00:01:13.140> you

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
your muscles so if you exercise you

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.699 
your muscles so if you exercise you
really<00:01:14.160> do<00:01:14.369> need<00:01:14.550> to<00:01:14.610> eat<00:01:14.940> carbs<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:16.110> problem

00:01:16.699 --> 00:01:16.709 
really do need to eat carbs the problem

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:18.859 
really do need to eat carbs the problem
is<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:17.160> that<00:01:17.190> a<00:01:17.369> lot<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:17.700> people<00:01:17.819> are<00:01:18.330> eating<00:01:18.509> an

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
is is that a lot of people are eating an

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.139 
is is that a lot of people are eating an
overabundance<00:01:19.380> of<00:01:20.149> carbohydrates

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:21.149 
overabundance of carbohydrates

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:23.300 
overabundance of carbohydrates
especially<00:01:21.330> in<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.349> form<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:22.740> processed

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
especially in the form of processed

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.730 
especially in the form of processed
foods<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.940> baked<00:01:24.330> goods<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:25.020> different

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
foods and baked goods and different

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.100 
foods and baked goods and different
breads<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.399> a<00:01:26.550> lot<00:01:26.789> of<00:01:26.970> pasta<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.569> that's

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
breads and a lot of pasta and that's

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.469 
breads and a lot of pasta and that's
where<00:01:28.380> we're<00:01:28.560> going<00:01:28.830> wrong<00:01:29.149> another<00:01:30.149> thing

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
where we're going wrong another thing

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.839 
where we're going wrong another thing
that<00:01:30.509> happens<00:01:31.110> with<00:01:31.349> carbohydrates<00:01:32.310> is<00:01:32.520> they

00:01:32.839 --> 00:01:32.849 
that happens with carbohydrates is they

00:01:32.849 --> 00:01:34.880 
that happens with carbohydrates is they
turn<00:01:33.119> into<00:01:33.330> glucose<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.110> if<00:01:34.500> your<00:01:34.649> body

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
turn into glucose and if your body

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.070 
turn into glucose and if your body
doesn't<00:01:35.009> use<00:01:35.550> them<00:01:35.819> then<00:01:36.179> it<00:01:36.330> turns<00:01:36.599> them<00:01:36.869> into

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
doesn't use them then it turns them into

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.130 
doesn't use them then it turns them into
fat<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:38.640> stores<00:01:38.910> them<00:01:39.240> in<00:01:39.479> your<00:01:39.630> body<00:01:39.869> as

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
fat and it stores them in your body as

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.999 
fat and it stores them in your body as
fat<00:01:40.860> so<00:01:41.729> okay<00:01:42.660> what<00:01:42.929> are<00:01:42.959> you<00:01:43.050> going<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.319> do<00:01:43.500> you

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
fat so okay what are you going to do you

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.650 
fat so okay what are you going to do you
need<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.369> eat<00:01:44.490> carbs<00:01:44.849> for<00:01:45.000> energy<00:01:45.060> into

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.660 
need to eat carbs for energy into

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.169 
need to eat carbs for energy into
function<00:01:46.140> but<00:01:46.830> you<00:01:47.310> don't<00:01:47.610> want<00:01:47.789> to<00:01:47.849> eat<00:01:47.970> too

00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:48.179 
function but you don't want to eat too

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:50.660 
function but you don't want to eat too
many<00:01:48.300> carbs<00:01:48.630> so<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:49.050> you<00:01:49.170> gain<00:01:49.470> weight<00:01:49.670> will

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
many carbs so that you gain weight will

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.180 
many carbs so that you gain weight will
follow<00:01:50.970> these<00:01:51.300> rules<00:01:51.690> and<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.890> will<00:01:53.039> have

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
follow these rules and you will have

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.979 
follow these rules and you will have
enough<00:01:53.489> energy<00:01:53.700> from<00:01:54.090> your<00:01:54.209> carbohydrates

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:54.989 
enough energy from your carbohydrates

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:58.669 
enough energy from your carbohydrates
without<00:01:55.440> gaining<00:01:55.709> weight<00:01:56.450> only<00:01:57.450> eat<00:01:57.690> starchy

00:01:58.669 --> 00:01:58.679 
without gaining weight only eat starchy

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:01.729 
without gaining weight only eat starchy
carbohydrates<00:01:59.610> after<00:02:00.300> activity<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.259> after

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:01.739 
carbohydrates after activity and after

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:04.850 
carbohydrates after activity and after
