00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:13.160
 service and welcome here 

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:14.990
 research i am the role and i have 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.700
 a brand new cradle for you and indeed 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.070
 I recently had luck 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.690
 shopping at the weekend on the 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.930
 a discounter's parking 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:26.630
 see brand new mercedes gl e 63 amg 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.240
 and I assume that one 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.369
 angeber because pretty cheap pretty 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.930
 but moderately anything could equal itself 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.970
 I see here playing all night 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.320
 into it and that I had the 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.520
 possibility times drum to run the 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.199
 whole thing times in the wild too 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.059
 see without much disguise without everything 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:44.269
 All in all , mercedes presents this 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:46.640
 vehicle straight on many measure around 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:47.930
 around the globe and official 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.960
 the start of sales is third 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.970
 2015 does not fool me 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.229
 should come with v6 and v8 engines but 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.570
 I obviously have the top version 

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:59.350
 got in front of the lens and a few 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.350
 details follow now 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.170
 so I'm the gls again 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.010
 principle nothing else like that 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.150
 counterpart to the bmw x6 I do not know 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.580
 why tell it for so long 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.200
 used this vehicle class 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:07.040
 Both can see each other out as well 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:10.220
 very similar to higher qps 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.630
 I say it's a thing in itself because 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.370
 technically we bring space 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.620
 not much so I know what and x6 should 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.170
 you 're sitting there headless and so on 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.520
 Next is not the bringer 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.050
 also trunk space is limited by the 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.530
 sloping tailgate I know it 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.750
 myself from my rx 450 lexus has 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.690
 not again ml quasi such a big one 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.130
 beautiful from so nice tailgate should 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.959
 with a nice angular trunk where 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.100
 you get a lot of stuff but they fall 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.140
 then take the slices in the 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.250
 Seriously , always take a seat on it 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.020
 that is of course as always 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.420
 lifestyle cars many people let themselves 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:44.780
 the badges are simply super suv too 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.130
 find powerful and I just think so 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.150
 Everyone has to decide for themselves if he wants to 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.370
 to have something like that or not 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.130
 I just wanted to show for 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.830
 more videos stay tuned 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.530
 shares leigt and pulls you main channel 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:01.390
 again and again I would be happy 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.390
 so have fun and see you soon
