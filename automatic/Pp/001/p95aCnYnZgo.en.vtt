00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
versus oz and you know I'm gonna expect

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.020

good<00:00:48.989> things<00:00:49.050> from<00:00:49.289> him<00:00:49.559> on<00:00:49.739> this<00:00:50.280> in<00:00:50.879> this

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
good things from him on this in this

matchup<00:00:51.239> on<00:00:51.539> Shin<00:00:52.350> Heung<00:00:52.800> young<00:00:53.370> chap<00:00:54.210> on

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
matchup on Shin Heung young chap on

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.080 
matchup on Shin Heung young chap on
byung<00:00:54.600> is<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:55.140> fairly<00:00:55.559> down<00:00:55.800> SMAP<00:00:56.129> might<00:00:56.879> be<00:00:57.059> a

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
byung is a fairly down SMAP might be a

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.510 
byung is a fairly down SMAP might be a
little<00:00:57.570> bit<00:00:57.809> balanced<00:00:58.350> towards<00:00:58.890> pro<00:00:59.070> laws<00:00:59.250> but

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
little bit balanced towards pro laws but

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.979 
little bit balanced towards pro laws but
I<00:00:59.579> think<00:00:59.820> maybe<00:00:59.969> that<00:01:00.180> was<00:01:00.270> just<00:01:00.300> old<00:01:00.629> chip<00:01:00.870> on

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
I think maybe that was just old chip on

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.840 
I think maybe that was just old chip on
my<00:01:01.020> own<00:01:01.289> looking<00:01:02.100> up<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.250> stats<00:01:02.520> right<00:01:02.699> now

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
my own looking up the stats right now

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.210 
my own looking up the stats right now
it's<00:01:03.090> actually<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.570> Terran<00:01:04.470> favor<00:01:04.739> down<00:01:04.979> Wow

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
it's actually a Terran favor down Wow

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.570 
it's actually a Terran favor down Wow
okay<00:01:05.909> so<00:01:05.970> it's<00:01:06.240> actually<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.600> 13<00:01:07.200> Terran<00:01:07.860> 7

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
okay so it's actually a 13 Terran 7

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.179 
okay so it's actually a 13 Terran 7
Protoss<00:01:08.970> interesting<00:01:09.540> because<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.770> previous

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
Protoss interesting because the previous

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.859 
Protoss interesting because the previous
version<00:01:11.549> was<00:01:11.729> 19<00:01:12.420> /<00:01:12.630> r<00:01:12.659> us<00:01:12.810> 10<00:01:13.439> Terran<00:01:14.130> so

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
version was 19 / r us 10 Terran so

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:17.929 
version was 19 / r us 10 Terran so
somehow<00:01:15.869> but<00:01:16.619> with<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:16.979> small<00:01:17.189> modifications

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
somehow but with the small modifications

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.109 
somehow but with the small modifications
on<00:01:18.119> this<00:01:18.270> map<00:01:18.479> it's<00:01:18.750> become<00:01:19.140> much<00:01:19.409> more<00:01:20.119> Terran

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
on this map it's become much more Terran

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.789 
on this map it's become much more Terran
favor<00:01:21.390> than<00:01:21.630> Protoss<00:01:21.990> favorite<00:01:22.350> interesting

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
favor than Protoss favorite interesting

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.850 
favor than Protoss favorite interesting

the pause i believe to fix his
headphones<00:01:36.829> it<00:01:37.829> was<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:38.009> sound<00:01:38.189> issue<00:01:38.369> i<00:01:38.520> think

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.399 
starcraft and obviously having a pause
being<00:01:47.610> thrown<00:01:47.850> in<00:01:48.030> there<00:01:48.149> is<00:01:48.360> very<00:01:49.229> bad

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
being thrown in there is very bad

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.289 
being thrown in there is very bad
possibly<00:01:50.040> in<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.460> lots<00:01:50.759> of<00:01:50.850> parts<00:01:51.090> of<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.240> game

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
possibly in a lots of parts of the game

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.969 
possibly in a lots of parts of the game
and<00:01:51.450> could<00:01:51.570> change<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.960> outcome<00:01:51.990> even<00:01:52.560> so

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
and could change the outcome even so

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.249 
and could change the outcome even so
that<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.460> why<00:01:53.689> obviously<00:01:54.689> you<00:01:54.780> can't<00:01:55.020> pause

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
that is why obviously you can't pause

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.530 
that is why obviously you can't pause
without<00:01:55.590> reason<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.880> you<00:01:56.969> also<00:01:57.119> get<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.299> chat

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
without reason and you also get a chat

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.880 
without reason and you also get a chat
anymore<00:01:57.719> years<00:01:58.229> ago<00:01:58.409> you<00:01:58.469> could<00:01:58.680> but<00:01:58.829> you

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
anymore years ago you could but you

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.490 
anymore years ago you could but you
can't<00:01:59.130> now<00:01:59.329> and<00:02:00.329> I<00:02:00.689> don't<00:02:00.930> know<00:02:01.079> really<00:02:01.290> why

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
can't now and I don't know really why

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.730 
can't now and I don't know really why
that<00:02:01.799> is<00:02:01.979> I<00:02:02.250> guess<00:02:02.399> they<00:02:02.909> just<00:02:02.939> want

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
that is I guess they just want

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.350 
that is I guess they just want
make<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.830> game<00:02:05.010> more<00:02:05.040> civil<00:02:05.760> perhaps<00:02:06.090> many

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
make the game more civil perhaps many

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.450 
make the game more civil perhaps many

maybe<00:05:14.530> that's<00:05:14.919> going<00:05:15.130> to<00:05:15.190> be<00:05:15.250> a<00:05:15.280> little<00:05:15.460> bit<00:05:15.580> of

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:15.699 
maybe that's going to be a little bit of

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:19.290 
maybe that's going to be a little bit of
an<00:05:15.820> benefit<00:05:16.360> for<00:05:16.620> for<00:05:17.620> iris<00:05:17.949> and<00:05:18.130> here<00:05:19.120> we're

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
an benefit for for iris and here we're

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.640 
an benefit for for iris and here we're
seeing<00:05:19.479> a<00:05:19.510> second<00:05:19.840> gate<00:05:19.930> going<00:05:20.169> up<00:05:20.289> okay<00:05:20.590> so

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
seeing a second gate going up okay so

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.950 
seeing a second gate going up okay so
it's<00:05:20.949> going<00:05:21.039> to<00:05:21.099> be<00:05:21.220> a<00:05:21.250> to<00:05:21.460> gate<00:05:21.669> here<00:05:22.180> we'll

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 
it's going to be a to gate here we'll

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.629 
it's going to be a to gate here we'll
see<00:05:23.139> if<00:05:23.199> he<00:05:23.260> decides<00:05:23.500> to<00:05:23.620> pursue<00:05:23.860> this<00:05:24.159> really

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:24.639 
see if he decides to pursue this really

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:25.710 
see if he decides to pursue this really
heavily<00:05:24.820> or<00:05:25.180> if<00:05:25.300> you're<00:05:25.389> just<00:05:25.419> going<00:05:25.630> to

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 
heavily or if you're just going to

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.580 
heavily or if you're just going to
transition<00:05:26.139> into<00:05:26.409> a<00:05:26.560> fast<00:05:27.310> expand<00:05:27.789> and<00:05:28.590> for

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.590 
transition into a fast expand and for

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.770 
transition into a fast expand and for
for<00:05:30.130> iris<00:05:31.030> it<00:05:31.180> looks<00:05:31.330> like<00:05:31.449> we're<00:05:31.599> going<00:05:31.720> to

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:31.780 
for iris it looks like we're going to

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.890 
for iris it looks like we're going to
probably<00:05:32.050> see<00:05:32.409> a<00:05:32.440> to<00:05:33.340> factory<00:05:33.760> here<00:05:33.970> because<00:05:34.840> i

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
probably see a to factory here because i

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.320 
probably see a to factory here because i
see<00:05:35.110> all<00:05:35.470> the<00:05:35.710> SUV's<00:05:36.039> stolen<00:05:36.370> gas<00:05:36.520> and<00:05:36.880> it

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
see all the SUV's stolen gas and it

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.089 
see all the SUV's stolen gas and it
looks<00:05:37.510> like<00:05:37.570> you<00:05:38.169> know<00:05:38.260> he<00:05:38.409> by<00:05:38.560> sealing<00:05:38.979> off

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:39.099 
looks like you know he by sealing off

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:41.430 
looks like you know he by sealing off
his<00:05:39.250> wall<00:05:39.430> sealing<00:05:40.300> off<00:05:40.389> his<00:05:40.539> choke<00:05:41.080> point<00:05:41.349> i

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 
his wall sealing off his choke point i

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.260 
his wall sealing off his choke point i
think<00:05:41.620> that<00:05:41.770> was<00:05:42.039> signal<00:05:42.699> to<00:05:42.789> us<00:05:42.909> at<00:05:43.120> least

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.270 
think that was signal to us at least

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.149 
think that was signal to us at least
he's<00:05:43.479> be<00:05:43.599> trying<00:05:43.840> to<00:05:43.870> be<00:05:43.990> sneaky<00:05:44.110> and<00:05:44.440> it<00:05:44.979> might

00:05:45.149 --> 00:05:45.159 
he's be trying to be sneaky and it might

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:47.279 
he's be trying to be sneaky and it might
be<00:05:45.190> what<00:05:45.639> is<00:05:45.729> it<00:05:45.880> um<00:05:46.060> interesting<00:05:46.990> enough

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:47.289 
be what is it um interesting enough

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:48.480 
be what is it um interesting enough
looks<00:05:47.530> like<00:05:47.650> he's<00:05:47.770> just<00:05:47.860> scouting<00:05:48.159> with<00:05:48.340> that

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.490 
looks like he's just scouting with that

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:52.920 
looks like he's just scouting with that
a<00:05:48.520> CB<00:05:49.680> and<00:05:51.300> really<00:05:52.300> i<00:05:52.330> don't<00:05:52.510> know<00:05:52.630> what<00:05:52.750> it<00:05:52.840> is

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:52.930 
a CB and really i don't know what it is

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.490 
a CB and really i don't know what it is
yet<00:05:54.210> we're<00:05:55.210> seeing<00:05:55.479> the<00:05:55.659> barracks<00:05:56.110> floating

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:56.500 
yet we're seeing the barracks floating

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:57.750 
yet we're seeing the barracks floating
yeah<00:05:56.770> so<00:05:57.070> the<00:05:57.159> barracks<00:05:57.430> is<00:05:57.520> going<00:05:57.639> to<00:05:57.699> be

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:57.760 
yeah so the barracks is going to be

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.000 
yeah so the barracks is going to be
trying<00:05:58.030> to<00:05:58.060> scout<00:05:58.330> there<00:05:58.630> it<00:05:59.560> might<00:05:59.740> even<00:05:59.770> get

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.010 
trying to scout there it might even get

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:02.730 
trying to scout there it might even get
killed<00:06:00.280> by<00:06:00.370> dragoon<00:06:01.020> probably<00:06:02.020> not<00:06:02.139> but<00:06:02.500> it

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:02.740 
killed by dragoon probably not but it

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.469 
killed by dragoon probably not but it
looks<00:06:02.889> like<00:06:02.919> just<00:06:03.250> a<00:06:03.340> tank<00:06:03.520> being<00:06:04.210> built<00:06:04.419> there

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:04.479 
looks like just a tank being built there

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:06.270 
looks like just a tank being built there
and<00:06:04.900> it<00:06:05.289> looks<00:06:05.440> like<00:06:05.530> it<00:06:05.740> will<00:06:05.860> be<00:06:05.919> just<00:06:06.159> the

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:06.280 
and it looks like it will be just the

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.420 
and it looks like it will be just the
fast<00:06:06.460> expand<00:06:07.650> well<00:06:08.650> at<00:06:08.710> least<00:06:08.800> it<00:06:09.070> seems<00:06:09.280> like

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:09.430 
fast expand well at least it seems like

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:12.719 
fast expand well at least it seems like
it<00:06:09.610> uh<00:06:10.080> yeah<00:06:11.080> is<00:06:11.380> it<00:06:11.949> just<00:06:12.280> going<00:06:12.370> to<00:06:12.430> be<00:06:12.490> fast

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:12.729 
it uh yeah is it just going to be fast

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:14.670 
it uh yeah is it just going to be fast
expand<00:06:13.060> it<00:06:13.270> will<00:06:13.449> just<00:06:13.750> be<00:06:13.810> a<00:06:13.900> fastest<00:06:14.259> man<00:06:14.409> ok

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:14.680 
expand it will just be a fastest man ok

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.890 
expand it will just be a fastest man ok
so<00:06:15.009> i<00:06:15.280> guess<00:06:15.580> i<00:06:15.880> saw<00:06:16.060> wrong<00:06:16.330> i<00:06:16.360> guess<00:06:16.630> there<00:06:16.780> was

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:16.900 
so i guess i saw wrong i guess there was

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.290 
so i guess i saw wrong i guess there was
only<00:06:17.259> one<00:06:17.860> sec<00:06:18.430> on<00:06:18.550> gas<00:06:18.759> somehow<00:06:19.030> it's<00:06:19.240> all

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:19.300 
only one sec on gas somehow it's all

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.769 
only one sec on gas somehow it's all
three<00:06:19.860> anyway<00:06:20.860> so<00:06:20.940> looks<00:06:21.940> like<00:06:22.000> expansion

00:06:22.769 --> 00:06:22.779 
three anyway so looks like expansion

00:06:22.779 --> 00:06:24.360 
three anyway so looks like expansion
coming<00:06:22.930> down<00:06:23.110> for<00:06:23.260> any<00:06:23.409> time<00:06:23.650> also<00:06:23.830> so<00:06:24.130> both

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:24.370 
coming down for any time also so both

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:25.530 
coming down for any time also so both
players<00:06:24.520> expanding<00:06:25.090> and<00:06:25.180> this<00:06:25.300> is<00:06:25.389> actually

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:25.540 
players expanding and this is actually

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.409 
players expanding and this is actually
both<00:06:26.139> incredibly<00:06:27.070> standard<00:06:27.520> builds<00:06:27.910> you<00:06:28.330> know

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:28.419 
both incredibly standard builds you know

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:31.140 
both incredibly standard builds you know
to<00:06:29.290> get<00:06:29.470> core<00:06:29.740> into<00:06:30.010> expansion<00:06:30.520> is<00:06:30.699> like<00:06:30.940> the

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:31.150 
to get core into expansion is like the

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:35.580 
to get core into expansion is like the
most<00:06:31.300> common<00:06:31.810> pvt<00:06:32.680> build<00:06:32.889> ever<00:06:33.130> I<00:06:34.500> think<00:06:35.500> if

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:35.590 
most common pvt build ever I think if

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:36.870 
most common pvt build ever I think if
they<00:06:35.680> did<00:06:35.830> a<00:06:35.860> study<00:06:35.949> it<00:06:36.430> would<00:06:36.550> actually<00:06:36.669> be

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:36.880 
they did a study it would actually be

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.820 
they did a study it would actually be
the<00:06:37.150> most<00:06:37.300> common<00:06:37.750> at<00:06:38.050> least<00:06:38.229> on<00:06:38.350> the<00:06:38.440> amateur

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:38.830 
the most common at least on the amateur

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:40.920 
the most common at least on the amateur
level<00:06:38.979> it<00:06:39.190> really<00:06:39.400> is<00:06:39.610> one<00:06:40.180> gate<00:06:40.360> expand<00:06:40.810> is

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:40.930 
level it really is one gate expand is

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:44.310 
level it really is one gate expand is
also<00:06:41.199> very<00:06:41.710> common<00:06:42.120> one<00:06:43.120> gate<00:06:43.360> Robo<00:06:43.750> ops

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:44.320 
also very common one gate Robo ops

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.040 
also very common one gate Robo ops
expansion<00:06:45.310> that's<00:06:46.210> more<00:06:46.360> of<00:06:46.479> a<00:06:46.540> pro<00:06:46.780> built

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:47.050 
expansion that's more of a pro built

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:49.620 
expansion that's more of a pro built
though<00:06:47.199> I<00:06:47.260> think<00:06:47.910> when<00:06:48.910> the<00:06:49.060> pro<00:06:49.389> players

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:49.630 
though I think when the pro players

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:51.390 
though I think when the pro players
really<00:06:50.080> feel<00:06:50.260> like<00:06:50.410> they<00:06:50.530> need<00:06:50.770> observers

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:51.400 
really feel like they need observers

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.820 
really feel like they need observers
because<00:06:51.669> you<00:06:52.030> know<00:06:52.120> pro<00:06:52.600> vulture<00:06:53.320> micros<00:06:53.650> so

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:53.830 
because you know pro vulture micros so

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:56.010 
because you know pro vulture micros so
good<00:06:54.040> anyway<00:06:55.000> that<00:06:55.150> looks<00:06:55.510> like<00:06:55.570> a<00:06:55.630> robotics

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:56.020 
good anyway that looks like a robotics

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.840 
good anyway that looks like a robotics
facility<00:06:56.110> going<00:06:56.500> down<00:06:56.680> now<00:06:56.860> as<00:06:57.100> expected<00:06:57.669> and
