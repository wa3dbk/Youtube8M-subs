 we're going to Mexico and the youth are the 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.450
 sector most affected by unemployment in 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.309
 December of last year in that country 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.590
 approved the labor reform which 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.710

 for hours also the outsourcing 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.820
 also known as outsourcing let's 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.680
 to learn more about the situation of the hand 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.000
 from our correspondent in that country 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.190
 jorge appointment 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.320
 several months ago Jorge Castro 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:28.540
 finished the advertising career 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.460
 since then he looks for offers daily 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.650
 of work in various portals of 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.140
 internet has already had several interviews 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.840
 but in all claims he has obtained the 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.460
 same answer if one day you have the 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.890
 experience that we are asking comes back 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.390
 because if we like how it works 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.879
 then it 's that kind of thing and it's 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.370
 well then how do I not go to 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.989
 start doing it right now 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.480
 I have no experience and everyone is 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.820
 asking fairs like this come thousands 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.980
 of young Mexicans hoping to 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.530
 find an opportunity that changes your 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.629
 lives 60 percent of those who have 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.540
 university studies lack 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:06.910
 employment, sometimes the family does not 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.940
 Lends to understand the reader that no 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.860
 he has work for the cautious kit and sometimes 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.600
 they think you 're lazy when you do not stop 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.910
 keep studying I need to have money 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.610
 because in a government school because 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.950
 in the university because it is complicated that 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.520
 this is the books that are too much 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.590
 expensive is notebooks to cover the 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.940
 demand for jobs the Mexican economy 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.220
 I should create more 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.050
 of one million jobs a year in the 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.360
 Currently, half of the 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.910
 calculation with almost 7 million 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.250
 unemployed the sector most punished by 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:42.760
 this situation is the one of understood age 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.710
 between 15 and 25 years old all that 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.920
 investment that the state made to 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:50.100
 can 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.700
 keep in that status then it comes 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.460
 down and it becomes a frustration 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:02:00.030
 for the print as a person and for his 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.979
 family later because he says so 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.400
 is the most practical thing is to grab me 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.830
 to informality 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.800
 practical and above all the only option 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.390
 for most of the Mexicans and 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.580
 is that more than 29 million 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.770
 workers 60% of the population 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.700
 economically active works in the
