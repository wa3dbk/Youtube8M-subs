00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
higher side but having said that if

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.360 
higher side but having said that if
you're<00:02:38.320> looking<00:02:38.560> at<00:02:38.650> this<00:02:38.830> kind<00:02:39.160> of<00:02:39.280> a

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
you're looking at this kind of a

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.580

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
processing power in this size and weight

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.410 
processing power in this size and weight
then<00:02:42.190> it's<00:02:42.370> a<00:02:42.460> reasonable<00:02:42.850> premium<00:02:43.150> to<00:02:43.270> pay

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
then it's a reasonable premium to pay

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.930 
then it's a reasonable premium to pay
but<00:02:43.960> that's<00:02:44.140> your<00:02:44.290> call<00:02:44.430> so<00:02:45.430> before<00:02:45.580> we<00:02:45.730> wrap

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
but that's your call so before we wrap

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.550 
but that's your call so before we wrap
this<00:02:46.000> let's<00:02:46.390> quickly<00:02:46.570> revisit<00:02:47.080> its<00:02:47.260> pros<00:02:47.530> and

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
this let's quickly revisit its pros and

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.290 
this let's quickly revisit its pros and
cons<00:02:47.890> what<00:02:48.310> goes<00:02:48.490> in<00:02:48.610> favour<00:02:48.760> of<00:02:48.850> this<00:02:49.030> laptop

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
as I said before is its size and weight

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.830 
as I said before is its size and weight
and<00:02:51.490> also<00:02:51.910> the<00:02:52.000> impressive<00:02:52.420> screen<00:02:52.660> that<00:02:52.810> is

it has along with its touch sensitivity
of<00:02:55.000> course<00:02:55.330> what<00:02:55.960> goes<00:02:56.230> against<00:02:56.770> it<00:02:56.890> is<00:02:57.070> its

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
of course what goes against it is its

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.090 
of course what goes against it is its
inability<00:02:58.030> to<00:02:58.540> play<00:02:58.690> high<00:02:58.930> in<00:02:59.050> games<00:02:59.260> and<00:02:59.530> of

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
course there is no optical drive here

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.630 
course there is no optical drive here
because<00:03:01.630> of<00:03:01.750> its<00:03:01.900> size<00:03:02.110> and<00:03:02.350> last<00:03:03.220> but<00:03:03.310> not<00:03:03.580> the
