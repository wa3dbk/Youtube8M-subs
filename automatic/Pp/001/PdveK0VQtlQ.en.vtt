00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
there was a very there was an ingenious

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.310 
there was a very there was an ingenious
woman<00:02:02.700> at<00:02:03.000> one<00:02:03.240> time<00:02:03.420> she<00:02:03.600> got<00:02:03.750> tired<00:02:04.079> of

woman at one time she got tired of

washing her husband's clothing and she

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.479 
washing her husband's clothing and she
said<00:02:07.079> you<00:02:07.229> know<00:02:07.350> wouldn't<00:02:08.009> it<00:02:08.069> be<00:02:08.160> easier

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
said you know wouldn't it be easier

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.809 
said you know wouldn't it be easier
because<00:02:08.640> it's<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.209> cuffs<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:09.959> it's<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:10.979> the

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
because it's the cuffs and it's the the

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.520 
because it's the cuffs and it's the the
collar<00:02:12.090> they<00:02:12.360> get<00:02:12.540> dirty<00:02:12.750> all<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.020> time<00:02:13.170> in<00:02:13.470> a

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
collar they get dirty all the time in a

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.730 
collar they get dirty all the time in a
way

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
way

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.010 
way
and<00:02:14.040> I<00:02:14.100> have<00:02:14.250> what<00:02:15.120> if<00:02:15.210> I<00:02:15.300> just<00:02:15.480> made<00:02:15.690> them<00:02:15.840> you

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
and I have what if I just made them you

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.540 
and I have what if I just made them you
know<00:02:16.110> so<00:02:16.260> that<00:02:16.440> they<00:02:16.560> came<00:02:16.860> off<00:02:17.100> and<00:02:17.340> so<00:02:17.460> she

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
know so that they came off and so she

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.090 
know so that they came off and so she
did<00:02:18.060> that<00:02:18.210> and<00:02:18.450> this<00:02:19.110> is<00:02:19.230> a<00:02:19.350> white<00:02:19.650> on<00:02:19.860> white

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
did that and this is a white on white

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.160 
did that and this is a white on white
shirt<00:02:20.160> because<00:02:21.060> that's<00:02:21.240> what<00:02:21.450> was<00:02:21.630> primarily

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
shirt because that's what was primarily

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.190 
shirt because that's what was primarily
worn<00:02:22.560> about<00:02:22.770> 100<00:02:23.250> years<00:02:23.460> ago<00:02:23.730> and<00:02:24.060> so<00:02:24.660> she<00:02:24.720> took

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
worn about 100 years ago and so she took

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.070 
worn about 100 years ago and so she took
it<00:02:25.260> so<00:02:25.620> it<00:02:25.890> was<00:02:26.100> she<00:02:26.610> basically<00:02:27.120> just<00:02:27.390> made<00:02:27.960> it

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
it so it was she basically just made it

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.830 
it so it was she basically just made it
so<00:02:28.410> that<00:02:28.440> they<00:02:28.680> were<00:02:28.770> interchangeable<00:02:29.550> and<00:02:29.840> so

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
so that they were interchangeable and so

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.540 
so that they were interchangeable and so
she<00:02:30.900> saved<00:02:31.230> herself<00:02:31.440> on<00:02:31.770> doing<00:02:32.040> laundry<00:02:32.250> and

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
she saved herself on doing laundry and

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.570 
she saved herself on doing laundry and
what<00:02:33.030> we<00:02:33.150> had<00:02:33.390> was<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:34.110> removable<00:02:34.920> collar<00:02:35.250> and

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
what we had was the removable collar and

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:36.920 
what we had was the removable collar and
the<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.540> cuff

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
the the cuff

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.020 
the the cuff
now<00:02:37.200> this<00:02:37.440> fell<00:02:37.740> out<00:02:37.950> of<00:02:38.040> style<00:02:38.520> because<00:02:38.760> it

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
now this fell out of style because it

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.360 
now this fell out of style because it
was<00:02:39.150> kind<00:02:39.390> of<00:02:39.450> a<00:02:39.600> pain<00:02:39.930> in<00:02:40.080> the<00:02:40.110> butt<00:02:40.350> to<00:02:40.590> to

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
was kind of a pain in the butt to to

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.090 
was kind of a pain in the butt to to
mess<00:02:41.520> with<00:02:41.670> this<00:02:41.820> stuff<00:02:42.060> to<00:02:42.210> attach<00:02:42.570> it<00:02:42.810> and

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
mess with this stuff to attach it and

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.340 
mess with this stuff to attach it and
laundry<00:02:44.100> became<00:02:44.490> easier<00:02:45.000> to<00:02:45.240> do<00:02:45.390> but<00:02:46.110> what

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
laundry became easier to do but what

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.040 
laundry became easier to do but what
stuck<00:02:46.710> around<00:02:46.890> was<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:47.700> idea<00:02:48.210> that<00:02:48.300> you<00:02:48.810> know

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
stuck around was the idea that you know

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.260 
stuck around was the idea that you know
you<00:02:49.140> could<00:02:49.500> actually<00:02:49.710> mix<00:02:50.190> and<00:02:50.430> match<00:02:50.580> collars

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
you could actually mix and match collars

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.020 
you could actually mix and match collars
and<00:02:51.450> cuffs<00:02:51.540> and<00:02:52.020> it<00:02:52.830> used<00:02:53.070> to<00:02:53.250> again<00:02:53.520> be<00:02:53.760> white

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
and cuffs and it used to again be white

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.700 
and cuffs and it used to again be white
on<00:02:54.240> white<00:02:54.450> but<00:02:54.690> then<00:02:54.840> you<00:02:54.990> saw<00:02:55.230> the<00:02:55.290> white

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
on white but then you saw the white

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.740 
on white but then you saw the white
probably<00:02:56.580> getting<00:02:56.910> stuck<00:02:57.180> on<00:02:57.330> blue<00:02:57.510> and<00:02:57.540> I'm

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
probably getting stuck on blue and I'm

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.240 
probably getting stuck on blue and I'm
sure<00:02:57.990> it<00:02:58.110> happened<00:02:58.410> the<00:02:58.500> first<00:02:58.530> time<00:02:58.800> because

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
sure it happened the first time because

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.430 
sure it happened the first time because
you<00:02:59.790> know<00:02:59.880> a<00:02:59.910> guy<00:03:00.300> had<00:03:00.630> to<00:03:00.780> head<00:03:00.930> to<00:03:01.050> work<00:03:01.260> he

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
you know a guy had to head to work he

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.600 
you know a guy had to head to work he
was<00:03:01.500> a<00:03:01.560> little<00:03:01.830> bit<00:03:01.920> maybe<00:03:02.130> he<00:03:02.310> didn't<00:03:02.520> really

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
was a little bit maybe he didn't really

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.760 
was a little bit maybe he didn't really
mind<00:03:03.270> so<00:03:03.510> much<00:03:03.690> and<00:03:03.840> his<00:03:03.930> wife<00:03:04.110> is<00:03:04.320> like<00:03:04.470> okay

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
mind so much and his wife is like okay

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.260 
mind so much and his wife is like okay
we're<00:03:05.010> putting<00:03:05.310> this<00:03:05.370> together<00:03:05.580> and<00:03:05.910> you're

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
we're putting this together and you're

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.640 
we're putting this together and you're
wearing<00:03:06.540> it<00:03:06.780> you<00:03:07.080> know<00:03:07.170> that's<00:03:07.350> how<00:03:07.470> I'd<00:03:07.620> like

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
wearing it you know that's how I'd like

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.740 
wearing it you know that's how I'd like
to<00:03:07.860> think<00:03:08.040> it<00:03:08.190> evolved<00:03:08.550> who<00:03:08.910> knows<00:03:09.090> yeah<00:03:09.600> it's

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
to think it evolved who knows yeah it's

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.390 
to think it evolved who knows yeah it's
probably<00:03:09.870> lost<00:03:10.290> there<00:03:10.530> in<00:03:10.620> history<00:03:10.920> but<00:03:11.250> in

sounds<00:04:47.800> like<00:04:47.980> a<00:04:48.070> good<00:04:48.400> combination<00:04:48.700> but<00:04:49.540> just

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
sounds like a good combination but just

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.159 
sounds like a good combination but just
know<00:04:49.960> the<00:04:50.169> history<00:04:50.530> and<00:04:50.800> know<00:04:51.490> the<00:04:52.210> the

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 
know the history and know the the

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:54.180 
know the history and know the the
symbolism<00:04:53.740> which<00:04:53.860> you're<00:04:53.980> going<00:04:54.070> to<00:04:54.130> be

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
symbolism which you're going to be

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.220 
symbolism which you're going to be
sending<00:04:54.580> out<00:04:54.880> there<00:04:55.150> to<00:04:55.330> the<00:04:55.419> world<00:04:55.660> but<00:04:56.080> it

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.230 
sending out there to the world but it

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.530 
sending out there to the world but it
sounds<00:04:56.590> like<00:04:56.770> you're<00:04:57.550> pretty<00:04:57.850> aware<00:04:58.330> of<00:04:58.450> it

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
sounds like you're pretty aware of it

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.000 
sounds like you're pretty aware of it
and<00:04:58.660> hopefully<00:04:59.320> with<00:04:59.470> that<00:04:59.590> little<00:04:59.740> bit<00:04:59.860> of<00:04:59.919> a

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.010 
and hopefully with that little bit of a

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:02.550 
and hopefully with that little bit of a
history<00:05:00.340> lesson<00:05:00.570> you<00:05:01.570> know<00:05:01.690> you'll<00:05:02.290> be<00:05:02.350> a

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
history lesson you know you'll be a

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.080 
history lesson you know you'll be a
little<00:05:02.800> bit<00:05:03.010> more<00:05:03.190> prepared<00:05:03.400> when<00:05:03.760> you<00:05:03.850> put

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
little bit more prepared when you put

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:05.970 
little bit more prepared when you put
this<00:05:04.210> together<00:05:04.419> the<00:05:04.840> other<00:05:04.990> thing<00:05:05.320> that<00:05:05.650> I

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:05.980 
this together the other thing that I

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:09.840 
this together the other thing that I
would<00:05:06.160> talk<00:05:06.490> about<00:05:06.520> is<00:05:08.400> okay<00:05:09.400> I'm<00:05:09.490> sorry

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:09.850 
would talk about is okay I'm sorry

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:12.240 
would talk about is okay I'm sorry
you<00:05:10.120> want<00:05:10.300> to<00:05:10.360> tone<00:05:10.690> down<00:05:10.720> the<00:05:11.620> rest<00:05:11.919> of<00:05:12.100> your

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
you want to tone down the rest of your

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.540 
you want to tone down the rest of your
outfit<00:05:12.669> because<00:05:12.940> this<00:05:13.570> contrast<00:05:14.320> is<00:05:14.530> going<00:05:15.460> to

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
outfit because this contrast is going to

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.640 
outfit because this contrast is going to
be<00:05:15.669> probably<00:05:16.030> the<00:05:16.180> style<00:05:16.630> feature<00:05:16.990> so<00:05:17.620> you

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
be probably the style feature so you

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.500 
be probably the style feature so you
want<00:05:18.160> to<00:05:18.430> you<00:05:18.729> know<00:05:18.850> be<00:05:19.000> looking<00:05:19.390> at

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:19.510 
want to you know be looking at

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:20.969 
want to you know be looking at
everything<00:05:20.080> else<00:05:20.229> you're<00:05:20.470> wearing<00:05:20.800> and

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:20.979 
everything else you're wearing and

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:22.590 
everything else you're wearing and
perhaps<00:05:21.280> tone<00:05:21.790> it<00:05:21.910> down<00:05:22.030> so<00:05:22.210> you<00:05:22.300> don't<00:05:22.330> want

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:22.600 
perhaps tone it down so you don't want

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.480 
perhaps tone it down so you don't want
to<00:05:22.690> necessarily<00:05:22.810> wear<00:05:23.260> your<00:05:23.770> brightest<00:05:24.280> tie

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
to necessarily wear your brightest tie

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.190 
to necessarily wear your brightest tie
you<00:05:25.000> don't<00:05:25.180> want<00:05:25.330> to<00:05:25.389> wear<00:05:25.510> an<00:05:25.630> outlandish

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:26.200 
you don't want to wear an outlandish

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.230 
you don't want to wear an outlandish
pocket<00:05:26.680> square<00:05:26.979> you<00:05:27.490> don't<00:05:27.700> want<00:05:27.910> it<00:05:28.000> to<00:05:28.120> be

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
pocket square you don't want it to be

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.730 
pocket square you don't want it to be
with<00:05:28.419> a<00:05:28.450> suit<00:05:28.810> that's<00:05:29.050> already<00:05:29.350> drawing

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 
with a suit that's already drawing

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.159 
with a suit that's already drawing
attention<00:05:29.889> basically<00:05:30.430> your<00:05:30.940> shirt<00:05:31.360> because

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:32.169 
attention basically your shirt because

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:33.780 
attention basically your shirt because
of<00:05:32.350> this<00:05:32.500> contrast<00:05:33.130> and<00:05:33.310> because<00:05:33.520> it's<00:05:33.700> not

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:33.790 
of this contrast and because it's not

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:36.180 
of this contrast and because it's not
you<00:05:34.540> know<00:05:34.630> the<00:05:34.930> most<00:05:35.110> common<00:05:35.530> thing<00:05:35.680> and<00:05:35.860> again

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190 
you know the most common thing and again

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:37.560 
you know the most common thing and again
this<00:05:36.310> depends<00:05:36.669> on<00:05:36.820> your<00:05:36.940> environment

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:37.570 
this depends on your environment

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:40.170 
this depends on your environment
but<00:05:37.990> you<00:05:38.169> probably<00:05:38.560> want<00:05:39.070> to<00:05:39.100> let<00:05:39.250> that<00:05:39.310> be<00:05:39.850> the

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
but you probably want to let that be the

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.390 
but you probably want to let that be the
item<00:05:40.630> that<00:05:41.200> you're<00:05:41.410> actually<00:05:41.560> wearing<00:05:41.919> that

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 
item that you're actually wearing that

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.120 
item that you're actually wearing that
pops<00:05:42.729> okay<00:05:43.720> well<00:05:44.080> hopefully<00:05:44.289> that<00:05:44.500> answers

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.130 
pops okay well hopefully that answers

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:47.640 
pops okay well hopefully that answers
your<00:05:45.220> question<00:05:45.669> and<00:05:46.020> you<00:05:47.020> know<00:05:47.140> we<00:05:47.260> didn't<00:05:47.530> get

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:47.650 
your question and you know we didn't get

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:50.700 
your question and you know we didn't get
into<00:05:48.250> a<00:05:48.550> lot<00:05:48.789> of<00:05:48.820> other<00:05:49.120> colors<00:05:49.600> I<00:05:49.810> think<00:05:50.320> this

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:50.710 
into a lot of other colors I think this

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.650 
into a lot of other colors I think this
contrast<00:05:51.280> it<00:05:51.430> works<00:05:51.640> great<00:05:51.970> with<00:05:52.150> light<00:05:52.450> blue

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:52.660 
contrast it works great with light blue

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.830 
contrast it works great with light blue
with<00:05:53.080> dark<00:05:53.410> blue<00:05:53.650> with<00:05:54.610> a<00:05:54.880> crew<00:05:55.150> I've<00:05:55.450> seen<00:05:55.750> it

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 
with dark blue with a crew I've seen it

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.290 
with dark blue with a crew I've seen it
with<00:05:55.960> pink<00:05:56.289> I've<00:05:56.710> seen<00:05:57.039> it<00:05:57.130> with<00:05:57.220> lavender<00:05:57.729> so

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300 
with pink I've seen it with lavender so

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.800 
with pink I've seen it with lavender so
but<00:05:59.050> but<00:05:59.289> primarily<00:05:59.919> it<00:06:00.820> works<00:06:01.060> with<00:06:01.330> solids

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:01.810 
but but primarily it works with solids

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.200 
but but primarily it works with solids
now<00:06:02.229> once<00:06:02.530> you<00:06:02.680> start<00:06:02.919> mixing<00:06:03.130> the<00:06:03.729> solid

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:04.210 
now once you start mixing the solid

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:08.400 
now once you start mixing the solid
white<00:06:04.530> collar<00:06:05.530> and<00:06:05.710> cuff<00:06:06.610> with<00:06:07.330> stripes<00:06:08.080> like
