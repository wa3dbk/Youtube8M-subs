00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
Anna Domino stretch piledriver I think I

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:58.300

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
big upset the pilot driver would

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.340 
big upset the pilot driver would
definitely<00:02:01.009> give<00:02:01.250> them<00:02:01.369> a<00:02:01.429> little<00:02:01.610> slow<00:02:01.910> ahead
