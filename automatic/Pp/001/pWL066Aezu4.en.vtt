for more videos so here I have the forum
setup<00:00:27.330> guess<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.960> number

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
setup guess the number

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.919 
setup guess the number
that's<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.460> LBL<00:00:29.760> answer<00:00:30.179> it's<00:00:30.630> basically

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
that's the LBL answer it's basically

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.959 
that's the LBL answer it's basically
display<00:00:31.380> that's<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.399> number<00:00:32.640> of<00:00:32.700> guesses

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
display that's the number of guesses

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.270 
display that's the number of guesses
will<00:00:33.329> be<00:00:33.450> shown<00:00:33.660> there<00:00:33.870> number<00:00:34.410> games<00:00:34.860> we've

goo box and here is a text box label the

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.650 
goo box and here is a text box label the
actual<00:00:47.280> button<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.940> actually<00:00:48.270> check<00:00:48.480> your

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
actual button to actually check your

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.639 
actual button to actually check your
guess<00:00:48.920> let's<00:00:49.920> get<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.250> code<00:00:51.199> so<00:00:52.199> first<00:00:52.469> I

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
guess let's get to the code so first I

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.130 
guess let's get to the code so first I
have<00:00:53.070> declared<00:00:55.309> these<00:00:56.309> six<00:00:57.210> variables<00:00:57.660> make

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
have declared these six variables make

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.369 
have declared these six variables make
sure<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.410> have<00:00:58.620> these<00:00:59.629> short<00:01:00.629> random<00:01:00.870> it's

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
sure you have these short random it's

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.460 
sure you have these short random it's
your<00:01:01.649> actual<00:01:02.219> random<00:01:02.699> comm<00:01:03.510> from<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.260> let

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
your actual random comm from the let

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.010 
your actual random comm from the let
random<00:01:04.890> class<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:07.939> making<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:09.000> new<00:01:09.180> random<00:01:09.570> and

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
random class and making a new random and

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.520 
random class and making a new random and
here<00:01:10.799> you're<00:01:11.520> short<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.970> secret<00:01:12.390> number<00:01:12.570> that's

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
here you're short a secret number that's

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.050 
here you're short a secret number that's
gonna<00:01:13.680> be<00:01:13.799> assigned<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.430> value<00:01:14.549> of<00:01:14.760> short

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
gonna be assigned to the value of short

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.450 
gonna be assigned to the value of short
random<00:01:15.210> dot<00:01:15.479> next<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:16.560> this<00:01:16.770> that<00:01:17.009> is<00:01:17.340> the

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
random dot next and this that is the

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.440 
random dot next and this that is the
number<00:01:17.729> from<00:01:17.880> one<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.150> hundred<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:20.450> short

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.290 
every time you click bTW and guess
button<00:02:17.070> so<00:02:18.070> I<00:02:18.130> have<00:02:18.280> a<00:02:18.310> try/catch<00:02:18.790> structure

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
button so I have a try/catch structure

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.170 
button so I have a try/catch structure
yeah<00:02:20.050> I<00:02:20.290> set<00:02:20.620> up<00:02:20.650> the<00:02:20.860> input<00:02:21.280> and<00:02:21.490> I<00:02:21.730> convert

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
yeah I set up the input and I convert

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.790 
yeah I set up the input and I convert
that<00:02:22.450> so<00:02:23.020> TX<00:02:23.590> input<00:02:24.040> text<00:02:24.550> is<00:02:24.840> um<00:02:25.840> converted<00:02:26.650> to

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
that so TX input text is um converted to

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.500 
that so TX input text is um converted to
short<00:02:27.160> and<00:02:27.370> it's<00:02:27.550> a<00:02:27.700> timed<00:02:27.970> to<00:02:28.570> short<00:02:28.870> input

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
short and it's a timed to short input

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.110 
short and it's a timed to short input
short<00:02:31.510> counter<00:02:32.050> here<00:02:32.500> is<00:02:32.710> gonna<00:02:33.520> be<00:02:33.670> added<00:02:34.000> by

play games right here and that's

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.610 
play games right here and that's
assigned<00:02:50.290> to<00:02:50.800> this<00:02:51.390> which<00:02:52.390> I<00:02:52.510> showed<00:02:52.720> you<00:02:52.750> all

just follow this part if it equals then

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.330 
just follow this part if it equals then
um<00:03:00.580> if<00:03:01.360> they<00:03:01.630> both<00:03:01.780> equal<00:03:02.080> then<00:03:02.860> you<00:03:03.010> guess<00:03:03.190> it

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
um if they both equal then you guess it

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.310 
um if they both equal then you guess it
right<00:03:03.370> L<00:03:03.760> the<00:03:03.940> other<00:03:04.060> answer<00:03:04.300> text<00:03:04.840> it<00:03:05.020> equals

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
right L the other answer text it equals

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.590 
right L the other answer text it equals
to<00:03:05.380> short<00:03:05.620> input<00:03:06.010> and<00:03:06.220> it's<00:03:06.700> correct<00:03:08.700> in<00:03:09.700> here

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
to short input and it's correct in here

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.660 
to short input and it's correct in here
I<00:03:10.630> just<00:03:10.720> had<00:03:10.990> it<00:03:11.110> a<00:03:11.170> bunch<00:03:11.380> of<00:03:11.500> colors<00:03:11.950> if<00:03:12.460> you

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
I just had it a bunch of colors if you

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.590 
I just had it a bunch of colors if you
want<00:03:12.850> to<00:03:13.030> you<00:03:13.300> can<00:03:13.450> have<00:03:13.480> that<00:03:14.070> um<00:03:15.210> the<00:03:16.210> code<00:03:16.420> is

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
want to you can have that um the code is

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.090 
want to you can have that um the code is
pretty<00:03:16.750> long<00:03:16.990> so<00:03:17.320> I'll<00:03:17.440> probably<00:03:17.650> put<00:03:17.860> this<00:03:17.980> in

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
pretty long so I'll probably put this in

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.050 
pretty long so I'll probably put this in
the<00:03:18.190> comment<00:03:18.550> section

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
I'll select case s HRT counter here it

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.770 
I'll select case s HRT counter here it
will<00:03:26.950> actually<00:03:27.100> grade<00:03:27.670> number<00:03:28.450> of<00:03:28.540> guesses

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
will actually grade number of guesses

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:29.460 
will actually grade number of guesses
you<00:03:29.050> did

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
you did

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.530

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
don't make sure of this code because it

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.280 
don't make sure of this code because it
needs<00:04:24.370> to<00:04:24.490> be<00:04:24.610> in<00:04:24.850> this<00:04:25.510> order<00:04:25.750> if<00:04:26.560> you<00:04:26.740> mix<00:04:26.919> it

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290 
needs to be in this order if you mix it

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.770 
needs to be in this order if you mix it
then<00:04:27.500> you<00:04:27.860> might<00:04:28.010> have<00:04:28.070> some<00:04:28.280> errors<00:04:28.820> have

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
you can delete some stuff like color

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.800 
you can delete some stuff like color
parts<00:04:33.770> and<00:04:34.070> stuff<00:04:34.340> but<00:04:35.240> here<00:04:35.480> I'm<00:04:35.600> just<00:04:35.720> saying

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
parts and stuff but here I'm just saying

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
parts and stuff but here I'm just saying
nothing

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
nothing

so after your answers is it's displayed

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:41.260 
so after your answers is it's displayed
it's<00:04:40.820> correct

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
it's correct

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:46.570 
it's correct
I'll<00:04:41.390> just<00:04:41.540> clear<00:04:41.840> it<00:04:41.870> out<00:04:43.510> next<00:04:44.510> else<00:04:45.170> if<00:04:45.580> if

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
I'll just clear it out next else if if

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.490 
I'll just clear it out next else if if
it's<00:04:46.850> greater<00:04:47.150> than<00:04:47.270> then<00:04:47.720> it<00:04:47.990> says<00:04:48.170> it's<00:04:48.350> too

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
it's greater than then it says it's too

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.940 
it's greater than then it says it's too
high

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950 
high

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.210 
high
else<00:04:49.370> too<00:04:50.120> low<00:04:50.300> then<00:04:50.780> I'll<00:04:51.590> just<00:04:51.830> had<00:04:51.980> another

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
else too low then I'll just had another

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.520 
else too low then I'll just had another

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:10.700 
and your new number numbers all might be

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.640 
and your new number numbers all might be
generated<00:06:11.180> so<00:06:11.210> it<00:06:11.540> isn't<00:06:11.780> as<00:06:11.900> I<00:06:11.930> say<00:06:12.140> isn't<00:06:12.530> the

generated so it isn't as I say isn't the

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:15.730 
generated so it isn't as I say isn't the
same<00:06:12.860> thing<00:06:12.890> that's<00:06:13.160> ten<00:06:13.430> tenths<00:06:14.060> -<00:06:14.240> no<00:06:14.740> yeah

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:15.740 
same thing that's ten tenths - no yeah
