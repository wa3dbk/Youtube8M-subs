00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
obviously see the belts are really

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.859 
obviously see the belts are really
cracked<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.789> what's<00:00:27.180> been<00:00:27.390> alerting<00:00:27.840> me

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
cracked and and what's been alerting me

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.109 
cracked and and what's been alerting me
to<00:00:27.990> this<00:00:28.260> problem<00:00:28.769> is<00:00:28.890> every<00:00:29.490> time<00:00:29.519> I<00:00:29.699> start<00:00:30.029> up

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
to this problem is every time I start up

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.340 
to this problem is every time I start up
the<00:00:30.210> car<00:00:30.650> squeals<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:32.750> just<00:00:33.750> indicates<00:00:34.170> that

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
the car squeals and just indicates that

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.440 
the car squeals and just indicates that
the<00:00:34.469> belts<00:00:34.770> are<00:00:34.890> worn<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.460> loose<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.390> I

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
the belts are worn and loose and I

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.639 
the belts are worn and loose and I
thought<00:00:36.600> maybe<00:00:36.780> I<00:00:36.899> could<00:00:36.960> tighten<00:00:37.350> them<00:00:37.440> but

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
thought maybe I could tighten them but

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.619 
thought maybe I could tighten them but
after<00:00:38.280> getting<00:00:38.730> underneath<00:00:38.940> here<00:00:39.270> it's

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
after getting underneath here it's

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:40.940 
after getting underneath here it's
pretty<00:00:39.840> obvious<00:00:40.290> that<00:00:40.440> they<00:00:40.590> need<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.770> be

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
pretty obvious that they need to be

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.010 
pretty obvious that they need to be
replaced<00:00:41.309> so<00:00:41.520> then<00:00:42.270> locate<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.600> parts<00:00:42.930> and

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
replaced so then locate the parts and

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.900 
replaced so then locate the parts and
we'll<00:00:43.110> see<00:00:43.230> if<00:00:43.290> we<00:00:43.379> get<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.620> off<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.700> just<00:00:44.850> a

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
we'll see if we get it off and just a

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.029 
we'll see if we get it off and just a
couple<00:00:45.030> other<00:00:45.300> side<00:00:45.539> notes<00:00:45.780> that<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.020> piece<00:00:46.920> of

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
couple other side notes that a piece of

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.049 
couple other side notes that a piece of
plastic<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:47.520> was<00:00:47.730> in<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.000> rear<00:00:48.239> well<00:00:49.140> on

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
plastic that was in the rear well on

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:52.520 
plastic that was in the rear well on
comes<00:00:51.059> off<00:00:51.180> three<00:00:51.449> bolts<00:00:51.750> one<00:00:52.079> bolts<00:00:52.379> right

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
comes off three bolts one bolts right

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.979 
comes off three bolts one bolts right
there<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.670> bolts<00:00:53.940> right<00:00:54.059> there<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.809> there's

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
there the bolts right there and there's

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.750 
there the bolts right there and there's
one<00:00:55.199> on<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.500> bolt<00:00:55.860> right<00:00:56.039> there<00:00:56.100> you<00:00:56.610> gotta

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
one on the bolt right there you gotta

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.450 
one on the bolt right there you gotta
loosen<00:00:56.910> up<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.239> get<00:00:57.360> that<00:00:57.390> off<00:00:58.219> once<00:00:59.219> again

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
loosen up to get that off once again

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.010 
loosen up to get that off once again
that's<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.820> tensioner<00:01:00.270> right<00:01:00.449> there<00:01:00.660> for<00:01:00.870> one

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
that's a tensioner right there for one

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.599 
that's a tensioner right there for one
of<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.170> belts

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.609 
of the belts

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:04.880 
of the belts
there's<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.789> alternator<00:01:03.180> tensioner<00:01:03.719> for<00:01:03.930> the

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
there's the alternator tensioner for the

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.920 
there's the alternator tensioner for the
other<00:01:04.979> belt<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.489> if<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.090> come<00:01:06.270> up<00:01:06.299> here<00:01:06.750> you

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
other belt and if you come up here you

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.990 
other belt and if you come up here you
can<00:01:07.260> see<00:01:07.700> right<00:01:08.700> down<00:01:09.030> there<00:01:10.280> is<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.340> tensioner

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
can see right down there is a tensioner

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.700 
can see right down there is a tensioner
for<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.360> third<00:01:12.570> belt<00:01:12.840> there's<00:01:13.170> three<00:01:13.380> belts

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
for the third belt there's three belts

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.070 
for the third belt there's three belts
and<00:01:14.220> it's<00:01:15.060> usually<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.360> pretty<00:01:15.420> good<00:01:15.659> idea<00:01:15.869> I

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
and it's usually a pretty good idea I

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.359 
and it's usually a pretty good idea I
guess<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.350> replace<00:01:16.619> all<00:01:16.830> three<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:17.310> that's

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
guess to replace all three so that's

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.120 
guess to replace all three so that's
what<00:01:17.580> I'm<00:01:17.790> probably<00:01:17.909> going<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.210> do<00:01:18.890> and<00:01:19.890> so

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
what I'm probably going to do and so

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.440 
what I'm probably going to do and so
regards<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.759> belts<00:01:21.060> we're<00:01:21.150> going<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.330> do

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
regards to the belts we're going to do

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.300 
regards to the belts we're going to do
the<00:01:21.600> one<00:01:22.049> closest<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.530> us<00:01:22.650> first<00:01:23.009> we're<00:01:23.220> going

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
the one closest to us first we're going

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.649 
the one closest to us first we're going
to<00:01:23.369> take<00:01:23.490> that<00:01:23.640> one<00:01:23.729> off<00:01:23.880> so<00:01:24.420> we're<00:01:24.509> going<00:01:24.600> to

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
to take that one off so we're going to

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.469 
to take that one off so we're going to
get<00:01:24.780> this<00:01:24.900> tensioner<00:01:25.439> up<00:01:25.560> here<00:01:26.150> and<00:01:27.150> what<00:01:27.390> I've

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
get this tensioner up here and what I've

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.870 
get this tensioner up here and what I've
been<00:01:27.509> doing<00:01:27.780> is<00:01:28.080> uh<00:01:29.270> seeing<00:01:30.270> that<00:01:31.880> unscrewing

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
been doing is uh seeing that unscrewing

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.359 
been doing is uh seeing that unscrewing
that<00:01:33.090> counterclockwise<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:34.259> it<00:01:34.979> was<00:01:35.070> kind<00:01:35.310> of

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
that counterclockwise and it was kind of

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.179 
that counterclockwise and it was kind of
stuck<00:01:35.640> so<00:01:35.820> I<00:01:35.850> wd-40<00:01:36.659> did<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.840> lot<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.320> just

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
stuck so I wd-40 did a lot and just

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.539 
stuck so I wd-40 did a lot and just
hammered<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:39.000> down<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:40.430> definitely<00:01:41.430> got

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
hammered it down and definitely got

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.999 
hammered it down and definitely got
looser<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.180> this<00:01:42.450> bolt<00:01:42.689> is<00:01:42.960> that<00:01:43.680> was<00:01:43.829> now

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
looser and this bolt is that was now

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.219 
looser and this bolt is that was now
almost<00:01:44.310> loose<00:01:44.610> enough<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:44.880> pull<00:01:45.270> off<00:01:45.450> I'm

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
almost loose enough to pull off I'm

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.139 
almost loose enough to pull off I'm
gonna<00:01:46.380> do<00:01:46.439> that<00:01:46.590> belt<00:01:46.799> first<00:01:47.009> then<00:01:48.000> the

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
gonna do that belt first then the

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.090 
gonna do that belt first then the
alternator<00:01:48.509> belt<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:48.960> then<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.619> serpentine

it back on the same way and you just

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.800 
it back on the same way and you just
tighten<00:03:03.190> that<00:03:03.340> bolt<00:03:03.610> up<00:03:03.880> and<00:03:04.480> we're<00:03:04.630> turning

belt and the alternator is a little bit

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:14.460 
belt and the alternator is a little bit
more<00:03:11.950> complex<00:03:12.640> you<00:03:12.850> have<00:03:12.910> to<00:03:13.200> remember<00:03:14.200> to

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
more complex you have to remember to

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.789 
more complex you have to remember to
tighten<00:03:14.709> this<00:03:14.980> bolt<00:03:15.190> first<00:03:16.620> and<00:03:17.620> you're
