00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:03.079
 all right 

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:07.600
 Welcome to online drawing and today 

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:09.879
 let's draw the figure in three 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.980
 three-quarter view rooms of the 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:13.539
 woman and we already did it in the figure 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.010
 male the object do it with the 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:16.960
 female figure is because there are some 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.730
 small differences and also because 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.220
 how is the figure a bit complicated 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.650
 it never hurts to do a brief review 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.449
 well let's do the same steps as 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.939
 we explained previously we do the 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:29.919
 small head and we make the shape of the 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:32.360
 body we said that here we go straight 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:35.120
 to the base 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.590
 something like that and this will be one of the two feet 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.870
 and here 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.160
 we said that this section of the 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.580
 clavicles is small while 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:46.600
 section is big big and small and 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.600
 we made this foot 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.789
 with this curve shape 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:56.750
 we make this foot with a direction towards 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:58.100
 here and this opens a little this foot very 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.170
 well now what will be the difference 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.269
 fundamental in the case of women for 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.369
 that seems more woman we are going to emphasize 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:07.369
 that shape of the hourglass that we have 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:09.409
 been commenting on either the two way 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:11.390
 trapezoids that is a very simple way 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.970
 to understand the woman's body and to 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.970
 do this we will emphasize here what 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:20.690
 would be the waist and emphasize what 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:23.570
 would be the hips already from the beginning this 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.610
 will help a lot to look like a woman 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.630
 the body and on the other hand we know that 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.720
 the body of the woman must be in 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.270
 overall thinner so when 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.950
 we draw the sketch of the arm we do not 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.950
 we will seek to go very far from this dot 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:42.850
 more or less like that we also know that pos 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:45.810
 we complain about the arm as thin as possible 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:50.820
 and well we also draw the neck 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.820
 thinnest possible 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.780
 and this can work like the sketch 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.490
 of the female figure 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.930
 now we will add other details 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.549
 that come out of what we already had 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.280
 talked about the fundamentals of the figure 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.140
 of three quarters well let's put this 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.819
 as the center line and it's in my set 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.920
 central body and here we are going to do 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.200
 one curvature out and here another 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.660
 outward curvature more or less this 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.010
 is the shape of the body let's say this 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.989
 is the central line of the rib cage 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.180
 and this is the centerline of the box 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.130
 pelvic and here more or less in the center 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.470
 would be the navel we are going to 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.290
 a little help to understand how to 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.250
 the body of the woman also fit 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.900
 of the man's body problems 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.910
 features these curvatures inside 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.970
 of the woman's body and more or less 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:39.140
 let's sketch the chest 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:42.380
 then as you can see 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:45.080
 this chest in this case touch the 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.790
 central line and in this case leaves the 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.790
 body line 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:55.040
 very well then let's do this 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:58.500
 we simply remark and let's draw 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.329
 here the shoulder just like we did in the 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.180
 arm profile without doubts with this arm 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:06.209
 you can check the tutorial of the arm of 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:09.209
 profile and you'll see that these things are 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.920
 comment there and well with the drawing of 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.900
 the legs is a bit difficult 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.750
 also if you have not seen in the tutorials 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.819
 and if not girls of the classes of the 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.489
 legs may cost you a little bit 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:22.290
 I work on the videos that we saw of 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.879
 legs let's clarify many of the 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.950
 things that we do here in a way 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:27.150
 Fast without changing anyway the 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.760
 legs in three rooms we're going to 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.739
 check in a class apart from the process 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.200
 we comment that here arribita of the 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.060
 central line with the center of the 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.519
 legs up are knees and 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.159
 we justify the legs slightly with 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:44.530
 this address because this is the view of 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:46.750
 three fourths and then we join 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.460
 this curvature and we saw it when we had 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.230
 legs 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:53.770
 also all these lines when we saw 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:56.340
 legs we talk about them 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.340
 A) Yes 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.670
 here with the sketch of the figure 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:12.400
 female really the only thing that we 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:15.739
 subtraction is maybe detail a little and 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.180
 trace on this sketch so you can see 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:19.389
 the figures that we can perform with 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.389
 they 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.040
 As you can see, draw a figurine of 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:27.170
 three quarters can be quite fast 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.820
 but if it requires us to do some 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:30.800
 how many repetitions of this drawing but 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:34.180
 every time we can do it with greater 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.180
 speed and with greater precision 

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:38.909
 clint up here today's class 

00:04:36.959 --> 00:04:41.129
 we hope it will be useful with simple 

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:44.809
 do not stop passing our tutorials and 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:44.809
 do not stop practicing until the next
