tool allen key let's show you that a

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.640 
tool allen key let's show you that a
second<00:01:26.400> as<00:01:26.549> well<00:01:27.020> here<00:01:28.020> we<00:01:28.140> go<00:01:28.290> with<00:01:28.470> the

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
second as well here we go with the

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.600 
second as well here we go with the
actual<00:01:29.450> wire<00:01:30.450> now<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.500> instructions<00:01:32.340> tell

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
actual wire now the instructions tell

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.340 
actual wire now the instructions tell
you<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:32.939> you<00:01:33.030> really<00:01:33.450> got<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.630> push<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.170> you

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
you that you really got to push and you

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.990 
you that you really got to push and you
do<00:01:34.650> because<00:01:35.250> I<00:01:35.340> think<00:01:35.400> it<00:01:35.640> makes<00:01:35.759> like<00:01:35.970> a

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
do because I think it makes like a

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.730 
do because I think it makes like a
little<00:01:36.299> it's<00:01:36.600> nicely<00:01:36.900> made<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.439> takes<00:01:37.650> a

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
little it's nicely made it takes a

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.370 
little it's nicely made it takes a
little<00:01:37.890> watertight<00:01:38.520> connection<00:01:39.210> where<00:01:39.780> this

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
little watertight connection where this

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.910 
little watertight connection where this
little<00:01:41.040> adapter<00:01:42.030> goes<00:01:42.540> into<00:01:43.200> right<00:01:43.649> into

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
little adapter goes into right into

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.280 
little adapter goes into right into
there<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:44.640> got<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:44.880> really<00:01:44.990> push<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.170> in

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
there and you got to really push it in

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.260 
there and you got to really push it in
there<00:01:46.470> hard<00:01:46.979> it<00:01:47.280> kind<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:47.790> makes<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.240> makes

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
there hard it kind of makes it it makes

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.929 
there hard it kind of makes it it makes
it<00:01:48.540> pretty<00:01:48.689> tight<00:01:49.340> again<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.460> make<00:01:50.579> gives<00:01:50.790> it<00:01:50.880> a

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
it pretty tight again it make gives it a

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.179 
it pretty tight again it make gives it a
little<00:01:51.090> waterproofness<00:01:51.750> on<00:01:52.140> there<00:01:52.350> how

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
little waterproofness on there how

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.889 
little waterproofness on there how
waterproof<00:01:53.549> is<00:01:53.880> it<00:01:54.030> I<00:01:54.149> don't<00:01:54.329> know<00:01:54.450> but<00:01:54.630> the

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
waterproof is it I don't know but the

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.260 
waterproof is it I don't know but the
connection<00:01:55.350> is<00:01:55.470> pretty<00:01:55.619> good<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:56.850> next<00:01:57.119> thing

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
connection is pretty good the next thing

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.429 
connection is pretty good the next thing

I'm sure you have a million things that

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.140 
I'm sure you have a million things that
take<00:02:09.989> that<00:02:10.170> reason<00:02:10.560> it's<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:10.800> little<00:02:11.009> screwy

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
take that reason it's a little screwy

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.090 
take that reason it's a little screwy
if<00:02:12.210> you<00:02:12.600> have<00:02:12.780> to<00:02:13.010> instruction<00:02:14.010> on<00:02:14.130> never

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
if you have to instruction on never

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.860 
if you have to instruction on never
flatten<00:02:17.100> out<00:02:17.190> you<00:02:17.310> think<00:02:17.580> a<00:02:17.730> nice<00:02:18.060> flatten<00:02:18.780> out

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
flatten out you think a nice flatten out

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.820 
flatten out you think a nice flatten out
the<00:02:19.020> wire<00:02:19.170> a<00:02:19.380> nice<00:02:19.850> silicon<00:02:20.850> stretchy<00:02:21.600> goes<00:02:22.590> on

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
the wire a nice silicon stretchy goes on

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.390 
the wire a nice silicon stretchy goes on
to<00:02:23.010> any<00:02:23.190> handlebar<00:02:23.880> type<00:02:24.270> of<00:02:24.450> thing<00:02:25.190> goes<00:02:26.190> on

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
to any handlebar type of thing goes on

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.120 
to any handlebar type of thing goes on
there<00:02:26.580> like<00:02:26.760> that<00:02:26.790> okay<00:02:27.150> and<00:02:27.900> it's<00:02:28.290> a<00:02:28.500> button

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
there like that okay and it's a button

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.760 
there like that okay and it's a button
like<00:02:30.110> membrane<00:02:31.110> type<00:02:31.680> button<00:02:33.440> then<00:02:34.440> it's<00:02:34.620> got

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
like membrane type button then it's got

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.920 
like membrane type button then it's got
the<00:02:34.890> bracket<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.820> bracket<00:02:35.850> itself<00:02:36.510> goes<00:02:36.780> on

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
the bracket the bracket itself goes on

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.660 
the bracket the bracket itself goes on
with<00:02:37.140> an<00:02:37.260> allen<00:02:37.590> key<00:02:37.620> it's<00:02:38.040> a<00:02:38.160> one<00:02:38.370> size<00:02:38.640> fits

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
with an allen key it's a one size fits

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.870 
with an allen key it's a one size fits
most<00:02:39.150> it<00:02:39.660> just<00:02:39.960> it's<00:02:40.260> like<00:02:40.410> at<00:02:40.530> like<00:02:40.770> a<00:02:40.880> hose

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
most it just it's like at like a hose

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.220 
most it just it's like at like a hose
clamp<00:02:42.120> it<00:02:42.360> just<00:02:42.540> keeps<00:02:42.720> gripping<00:02:43.140> and

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
clamp it just keeps gripping and

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.050 
clamp it just keeps gripping and
gripping<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:43.890> more<00:02:44.070> you<00:02:44.190> twist<00:02:44.550> it<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:44.880> more

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
gripping the more you twist it the more

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.580 
gripping the more you twist it the more
it<00:02:45.180> starts<00:02:45.390> to<00:02:45.570> come<00:02:45.750> out<00:02:45.900> and<00:02:46.050> a<00:02:46.080> tighter<00:02:46.350> the

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
it starts to come out and a tighter the

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.250 
it starts to come out and a tighter the
hole<00:02:47.630> the<00:02:48.630> loop<00:02:48.840> gets<00:02:49.100> and<00:02:50.630> what<00:02:51.630> happens<00:02:52.020> is

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
hole the loop gets and what happens is

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.360 
hole the loop gets and what happens is
that<00:02:52.530> once<00:02:52.740> this<00:02:52.920> is<00:02:52.980> on<00:02:53.130> and<00:02:53.550> this<00:02:53.670> is<00:02:53.820> on<00:02:55.370> this

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
that once this is on and this is on this

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.460 
that once this is on and this is on this
and<00:02:56.730> this<00:02:57.030> slide<00:02:57.600> right<00:02:57.900> on<00:02:58.110> and<00:02:58.860> it<00:02:59.430> clicks<00:02:59.700> on

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
and this slide right on and it clicks on

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.640 
and this slide right on and it clicks on
there<00:03:01.470> she<00:03:01.710> is<00:03:01.740> on<00:03:02.840> right<00:03:03.840> get<00:03:04.140> it<00:03:04.230> off

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
there she is on right get it off

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.230 
there she is on right get it off
you<00:03:05.040> got<00:03:05.130> to<00:03:05.220> reach<00:03:05.370> underneath<00:03:05.670> there<00:03:06.030> and

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
mounted it onto the the bracket is

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.130 
mounted it onto the the bracket is
mounted<00:03:34.440> on<00:03:34.560> to<00:03:34.740> the<00:03:34.860> stem<00:03:35.780> not<00:03:36.780> onto<00:03:37.080> the

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
mounted on to the stem not onto the

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.420 
mounted on to the stem not onto the
handlebar<00:03:37.470> but<00:03:37.620> you<00:03:37.710> can<00:03:37.860> mount<00:03:37.980> it<00:03:38.130> onto<00:03:38.280> the

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
handlebar but you can mount it onto the

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.390 
handlebar but you can mount it onto the
handlebar<00:03:38.790> the<00:03:39.330> the<00:03:39.720> the<00:03:40.470> only<00:03:40.650> limitation<00:03:41.310> of

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
handlebar the the the only limitation of

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.070 
handlebar the the the only limitation of
where<00:03:41.640> you<00:03:41.820> mount<00:03:42.030> it<00:03:42.210> is<00:03:42.360> the<00:03:42.510> length<00:03:42.780> of<00:03:42.960> that

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
where you mount it is the length of that

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:50.570 
where you mount it is the length of that
wire<00:03:43.380> the<00:03:43.950> wire<00:03:44.220> is<00:03:44.550> only<00:03:46.400> this<00:03:47.400> long<00:03:49.100> so<00:03:50.100> you

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
wire the wire is only this long so you

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.820 
wire the wire is only this long so you
could<00:03:50.790> maybe<00:03:51.000> even<00:03:51.360> mount<00:03:51.570> it<00:03:51.750> down<00:03:51.930> here<00:03:52.260> or

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
could maybe even mount it down here or

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.980 
could maybe even mount it down here or
you<00:03:53.010> can<00:03:53.160> maybe<00:03:53.340> get<00:03:53.610> really<00:03:54.270> technical<00:03:54.570> and

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:54.990 
you can maybe get really technical and

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.200 
you can maybe get really technical and
get<00:03:55.470> a<00:03:55.500> new<00:03:55.710> end<00:03:55.920> and<00:03:56.160> make<00:03:56.340> it<00:03:56.490> length<00:03:56.730> it<00:03:56.910> but

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:57.210 
get a new end and make it length it but

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:59.690 
get a new end and make it length it but
here's<00:03:57.720> where<00:03:57.930> we<00:03:58.140> put<00:03:58.320> art<00:03:58.560> we<00:03:58.740> put<00:03:58.950> our<00:03:59.070> horn

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
here's where we put art we put our horn

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.560 
here's where we put art we put our horn
our<00:04:00.050> button<00:04:01.050> right<00:04:01.920> there<00:04:01.950> and<00:04:02.430> wrap<00:04:03.390> it

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
our button right there and wrap it

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.980 
our button right there and wrap it
around

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:03.990 
around

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:05.690
