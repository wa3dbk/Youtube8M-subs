00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 hello to all and welcome to this 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.270
 new video in which I'm going 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.770
 introduce you to a theme of attack 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.139
 classic in the accelerated dragon 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.019
 introduced by the awesome american bobby 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.809
 fischer the dragon accelerated them four 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.490
 these five riders three riders c6 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.160
 of the four falls in love with the four horsemen 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.350
 takes 10 4 and here the accelerated dragon 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.359
 after the push of the angels pawn 6 you 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.810
 see the position of the dragon of the pawns 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.640
 blacks with hatchet g6 f7 etc that makes 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.009
 a little think of a dragon that's why 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.690
 so named here the whites 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.550
 play jumper these three classic moves 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.370
 who develops a room and who protects 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:42.149
 the pawn and 4 the blacks answer by crazy 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.410
 g7 whip three now we see that 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.820
 the blacks are in a position of 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.090
 eto'o droppings since their crazy 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.860
 and angers 7 whip three to protect the 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.920
 rider of the four attacked by this madman 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.010
 I have seven riders f6 attack the pawn 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.140
 and 4 also threatens the push of 5 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.710
 so it's white answer logically 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.260
 by crazy c4 who by the thrust of 5 and 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.090
 who puts pressure on the fire on the pawn 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.040
 in eps vii and we'll see to which 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.080
 point is important 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.960
 the blacks play little rock and the 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.360
 white jouf oven b3 but why bobby 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.159
 does fischer play b3 oven and well you 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.400
 will understand why in this 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.689
 variant the blacks and has 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.750
 regularly exchange their riders 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.189
 his 6 against the madman in b3 in order to 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.920
 ability to push 5 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.780
 for example is fine here fischer has everything 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.119
 just found the parade 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.430
 since on riders to 5 to exchange 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.920
 Lecavalier at 5 worked a lot 6 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.950
 against the madman in May three white and 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.439
 well they play them 5th saint louis the 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.820
 jumper c6 prevented the thrust e5 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.340
 since he could have simply 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.159
 take in the variant where he stays in 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.509
 these six riders takes b3 clashes 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.329
 unfortunately to a complication 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.610
 tactical that will make black people lose 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:00.500
 quite soon after them pro f 5 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:03.240
 riders takes to a place seven 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.189
 riders takes these two French ladies 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.320
 2 the rider thought of on failure the 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.509
 French lady to strive and after roy 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.780
 takes g7 and of course 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.870
 how to say whites have 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.790
 London - but it has two rooms 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.590
 against a tower is their parts 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.630
 are very active it will only remain to them 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.190
 more than at rock-hard and to be able to activate the 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.709
 rest of their room ie the tower 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.370
 located in h1 which is currently blocked 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.920
 by his king 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.510
 in e1 so this position is 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.459
 completely winning for whites 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.890
 we're not going to analyze it anymore 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.420
 serves just nothing actually there 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.690
 the white pieces are much more 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:42.840
 active and therefore the gain will be easy after 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.970
 e5 blacks can try to play by 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.489
 example riders h5 but they lose the 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.900
 jumper because of the thrust g4 and the 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.600
 black jumper naples with the eyes that 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.330
 case since if since silva on the 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:57.930
 box f6 it is engaged by the pawn 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:00.540
 five on the box f4 by the fool in e3 and 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.670
 finally on the box d3 by the pawn in hd 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.430
 or speak more one f2 so he can not 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.010
 play like that on the other hand if he goes 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.400
 on box g4 the white lady can 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.459
 take 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.220
 silva on the box e 4 the rider c3 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:16.019
 can take it and silva on the box of 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.420
 5 and the rider can still 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.280
 so take the black jumper no longer 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:25.190
 only one breaks to not be taken 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:28.350
 right now it's box 1.8 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.900
 only after the jump 1.8 jumpers 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.280
 the black lady does not have a lot of 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.440
 boxes and we'll see that it's a 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.150
 problem since after crazy takes f7 no 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.579
 you do not dream you take it to vii it's 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.799
 well the good move and well there would be by 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:43.109
 example everything resumes 9 7 and after 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.970
 riders in the cices the black lady has 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:47.400
 no more boxes are not protected 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.680
 therefore she is lost if she 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.510
 goes on his seven lecavalier learns if 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.090
 she stays on to learn how to learn 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:59.010
 and finally if she goes on b6 the crazy and 3 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:00.090
 take the lady in b 6 and so if we take 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.980
 last variant 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.930
 Well, it's the lady who takes care of 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:08.880
 capture his opponent in a 8 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.390
 that's why everything resumes at vii is 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.340
 not playable 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.650
 we'll see that roy takes f7 is 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.660
 no better given that riders 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.370
 of the six brings us the same threats 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.609
 for blacks so we see that 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.169
 scipion takes a program 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.909
 if the remaining lady of the eight lecavalier 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:26.490
 learns if she goes years and 7 

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:29.460
 the rider after also and if she 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.990
 in b 6 eh well the fool 3 would take this 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.970
 lady 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.770
 therefore the game would be lost 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.669
 then we will see the only variant 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.270
 still to be studied 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:41.669
 that is to say king f7 takes the ship here 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.199
 in May 6 after amd healthy there 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:46.020
 would have a quick math given 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:47.910
 that after forced wife 5 since the 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.710
 class f if this hold by the pawn 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.870
 to the 5 and the lady control this 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.780
 diagonal here and so especially the two 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:57.630
 boxes e6 and f7 well there would be 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:59.669
 simply g4 forcing the king extended 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:02.759
 4 since all the others 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:05.669
 boxes are taken and by the madman in e3 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:09.659
 who controls the box f4 and g5 the lady 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:11.370
 check boxes e4 e5 and e6 by 

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:15.270
 therefore the king must take this pawn 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:16.409
 angers 4 rounds failure is here if the king 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.569
 return to f5 

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:20.699
 it is matte immediately by 

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:25.409
 through the coup shots I have five 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:28.979
 chess and mat silva 1 h 5 is hardly 

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:32.759
 better since any 5denain rejection 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:37.050
 first ladies chess 4 is here so by 

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:38.820
 example the king h3 of alger four failures 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:44.419
 three points to them two and then by 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:47.130
 example lady I have two chess and dull 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:53.370
 therefore the last variant 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:58.400
 serwa h4 and after rouach 4 always the 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:06:03.150
 same idea ladies 4 and 6 for example king 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:04.080
 h3 and well just lady g4 esch 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.569
 failure 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.789
 roy takes h2 and the mat well let's talk about it 

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:12.930
 match of course pretty much everything 

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:14.550
 all the boxes for example g2 or g3 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.139
 we will also see each other 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:21.030
 variant ie after a failure 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:23.669
 if the king tries to leave via the 

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:26.699
 box h5 well he would have everything 

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:27.030
 simply lady g4 also fail and 

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:30.030
 mast 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:34.830
 therefore after turn failure the blow 

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:36.389
 the one who holds the most would be king h4 but 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:37.889
 they would be confronted also so 

00:06:36.389 --> 00:06:39.580
 shoulder to Leucate should see 

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:40.780
 and would be mater 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:43.569
 the black king would be very up 

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:47.650
 quickly that's why in this 

00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:49.870
 variant with little rock that comes 

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:52.000
 to be played for black bobby fischer 

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:54.280
 opt for the excellent shot and very 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.409
 brilliant b3 oven and quite simply 

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.150
 because oven b3 forbidden so 

00:06:56.409 --> 00:06:59.860
 tactical 

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:02.020
 the coming of the rider in 1-5 and therefore the 

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:03.490
 change this jumper against the oven b3 

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.810
 which is an important fund in this 

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:06.610
 position since they control the box 

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:08.650
 platform 5 and another and 

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:09.460
 prevent it from pushing black pawn 17 

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:12.099
 in d5 

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:14.500
 here is I hope this video has you 

00:07:12.099 --> 00:07:15.849
