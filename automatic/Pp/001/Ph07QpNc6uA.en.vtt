Johnson<00:00:11.700> at<00:00:11.880> all<00:00:12.059> then<00:00:12.719> she<00:00:12.960> did<00:00:13.139> a<00:00:13.170> tutorial

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
Johnson at all then she did a tutorial

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.640 
Johnson at all then she did a tutorial
on<00:00:13.950> this<00:00:14.160> but<00:00:14.910> she<00:00:15.089> has<00:00:15.210> dark<00:00:15.480> hair<00:00:15.619> so<00:00:16.619> I

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
on this but she has dark hair so I

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.099 
on this but she has dark hair so I
wanted<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:17.010> try<00:00:17.279> out<00:00:17.310> on<00:00:17.609> my<00:00:18.109> particularly

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
wanted to try out on my particularly

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.279 
wanted to try out on my particularly
super<00:00:19.439> blonde<00:00:19.770> hair<00:00:19.980> at<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.189> moment<00:00:20.990> which<00:00:21.990> I

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
super blonde hair at the moment which I

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.929 
super blonde hair at the moment which I
think<00:00:22.619> it<00:00:22.740> works<00:00:22.949> pretty<00:00:23.130> well<00:00:23.369> on<00:00:23.640> if<00:00:23.820> you

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
think it works pretty well on if you

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.689 
think it works pretty well on if you
have<00:00:24.180> like<00:00:24.570> light<00:00:25.289> hair<00:00:25.560> so<00:00:26.099> if<00:00:26.189> you<00:00:26.310> have<00:00:26.430> dark

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
have like light hair so if you have dark

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.019 
have like light hair so if you have dark
hair<00:00:26.760> I'll<00:00:27.119> put<00:00:27.330> a<00:00:27.359> link<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:28.470> her<00:00:28.650> tutorial<00:00:29.310> um

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
haven't wet mine at all and I feel like

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.940 
haven't wet mine at all and I feel like
it<00:01:38.460> I<00:01:38.759> tried<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.570> piece<00:01:39.900> of<00:01:40.140> down<00:01:40.350> here<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:40.890> I

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
it I tried a piece of down here and I

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.410 
it I tried a piece of down here and I
don't<00:01:41.100> even<00:01:41.189> know<00:01:41.430> where<00:01:41.610> it<00:01:41.700> is<00:01:41.820> there<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.360> is

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
don't even know where it is there it is

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.340 
don't even know where it is there it is
it<00:01:43.290> didn't<00:01:43.649> work<00:01:43.920> super<00:01:44.640> well<00:01:44.880> for<00:01:44.909> me<00:01:45.350> with

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
it didn't work super well for me with

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.080 
it didn't work super well for me with
wetting<00:01:46.680> it<00:01:46.829> but<00:01:47.159> I<00:01:47.189> don't<00:01:47.280> know<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.700> piece

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
wetting it but I don't know that piece

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.719 
wetting it but I don't know that piece
is<00:01:48.270> not<00:01:48.479> as<00:01:48.720> bright<00:01:48.990> light<00:01:49.710> blonde<00:01:50.310> so<00:01:50.579> I<00:01:50.610> think

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
is not as bright light blonde so I think

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.609 
is not as bright light blonde so I think
-<00:01:51.090> if<00:01:51.210> you<00:01:51.329> have<00:01:51.570> like<00:01:51.810> kind<00:01:52.140> of<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.350> bleached

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
- if you have like kind of a bleached

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.060 
- if you have like kind of a bleached
hair<00:01:53.549> look<00:01:53.880> this<00:01:54.180> might<00:01:54.810> work<00:01:54.990> better<00:01:55.590> on<00:01:55.710> that

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
hair look this might work better on that

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.179 
hair look this might work better on that
hair<00:01:56.399> -<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:57.390> just<00:01:57.600> shows<00:01:57.810> up<00:01:58.020> brighter<00:01:58.469> so

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
hair - it just shows up brighter so

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.819 
hair - it just shows up brighter so
maybe<00:01:59.399> on<00:01:59.579> darker<00:01:59.969> pieces<00:02:00.329> I<00:02:00.689> don't<00:02:00.810> know<00:02:00.869> but

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
maybe on darker pieces I don't know but

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.300 
maybe on darker pieces I don't know but
this<00:02:02.040> is<00:02:03.140> basically<00:02:04.140> what<00:02:04.380> I<00:02:04.409> did<00:02:04.560> like<00:02:05.100> she

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
this is basically what I did like she

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.920 
this is basically what I did like she
twists<00:02:05.790> her<00:02:05.820> here<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.240> I<00:02:06.329> tried<00:02:06.630> like

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930

and down I'm gonna use like the flat
part<00:02:25.160> of<00:02:25.280> this<00:02:25.460> sorry<00:02:26.150> this<00:02:26.240> one<00:02:26.540> broke<00:02:26.980> and

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
part of this sorry this one broke and

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.820 
part of this sorry this one broke and
just<00:02:28.280> go<00:02:28.460> down<00:02:28.670> like<00:02:29.000> this<00:02:29.270> on<00:02:29.510> that<00:02:32.590> I'm<00:02:33.590> just

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
just go down like this on that I'm just

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.880 
just go down like this on that I'm just
defined<00:02:34.310> a<00:02:34.430> the<00:02:35.260> flattest<00:02:36.260> piece<00:02:36.560> where<00:02:36.800> it's

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
defined a the flattest piece where it's

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:57.690 
defined a the flattest piece where it's
not<00:02:37.130> gonna<00:02:39.550> rub<00:02:40.550> against<00:02:41.030> your<00:02:41.210> hair<00:02:41.360> too<00:02:41.660> much

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.780 

it's<00:02:58.700> like<00:02:58.850> harder<00:02:59.150> for<00:02:59.330> me<00:02:59.450> to<00:02:59.540> get<00:02:59.630> the<00:02:59.780> ends

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
it's like harder for me to get the ends

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:14.730 
it's like harder for me to get the ends
just<00:03:01.790> like<00:03:01.970> slide<00:03:02.510> it<00:03:02.720> over<00:03:02.870> it<00:03:03.140> like<00:03:03.350> that<00:03:03.590> I

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.550 

just<00:03:15.740> like<00:03:15.920> like<00:03:16.760> the<00:03:16.970> subtlety<00:03:17.570> so<00:03:17.840> I<00:03:18.350> guess

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
just like like the subtlety so I guess

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.190 
just like like the subtlety so I guess
if<00:03:18.710> you<00:03:18.830> want<00:03:19.040> to<00:03:19.160> do<00:03:19.310> it<00:03:19.370> really<00:03:19.580> like<00:03:20.200> right

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
if you want to do it really like right

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.960 
if you want to do it really like right
maybe<00:03:21.710> the<00:03:21.980> water<00:03:22.190> would<00:03:22.460> work<00:03:22.640> well<00:03:22.940> with

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
maybe the water would work well with

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.840 
maybe the water would work well with
that<00:03:23.410> but<00:03:24.410> you<00:03:24.770> know<00:03:24.890> just<00:03:25.130> doing<00:03:25.310> like<00:03:25.550> little

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
that but you know just doing like little

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.230 
that but you know just doing like little
bits<00:03:26.090> and<00:03:26.330> pieces<00:03:26.420> here<00:03:27.130> and<00:03:28.130> like<00:03:28.730> I<00:03:29.150> just

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:29.240 
bits and pieces here and like I just

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.960 
bits and pieces here and like I just
really<00:03:29.510> like<00:03:29.780> mine<00:03:29.990> like<00:03:30.020> on<00:03:30.410> the<00:03:30.560> ends<00:03:30.950> to<00:03:31.880> you

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
really like mine like on the ends to you

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:37.840 
really like mine like on the ends to you
so<00:03:32.590> um<00:03:33.590> yeah<00:03:34.520> I<00:03:34.550> just<00:03:34.670> keep<00:03:35.030> the<00:03:35.240> piece<00:03:35.450> flat<00:03:36.850> no

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
so um yeah I just keep the piece flat no

00:03:37.850 --> 00:04:03.650 
so um yeah I just keep the piece flat no
do<00:03:38.240> a<00:03:38.270> green<00:03:38.630> on

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.630 

and<00:04:04.660> I<00:04:04.750> find<00:04:05.050> you<00:04:05.320> like<00:04:05.530> if<00:04:05.710> it's<00:04:05.920> not<00:04:06.130> wet<00:04:06.340> then

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
that it came off onto my clothes very

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:26.330 
that it came off onto my clothes very
much<00:04:20.730> but<00:04:21.730> least<00:04:21.940> not<00:04:22.150> yet

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:33.810 

just<00:04:27.340> like<00:04:27.550> just<00:04:27.730> keep<00:04:28.210> repeating<00:04:28.420> it<00:04:32.820> and

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
just like just keep repeating it and

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.460 
just like just keep repeating it and
then<00:04:34.090> it's<00:04:34.450> already<00:04:34.750> dry<00:04:34.960> so<00:04:35.200> you<00:04:35.290> don't<00:04:35.410> have

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
then it's already dry so you don't have

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:36.990 
then it's already dry so you don't have
to<00:04:35.650> worry<00:04:35.800> about<00:04:35.830> blow-drying<00:04:36.520> it<00:04:36.850> or

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
to worry about blow-drying it or

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
to worry about blow-drying it or
anything

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.190 

so<00:04:44.860> there's<00:04:45.280> that<00:04:45.430> piece<00:04:45.730> and<00:04:45.970> I<00:04:46.060> did<00:04:46.420> try<00:04:47.050> the

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
so there's that piece and I did try the

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.550 
so there's that piece and I did try the
yellow<00:04:47.800> on<00:04:47.980> here<00:04:48.540> if<00:04:49.540> you<00:04:49.720> can<00:04:49.900> see<00:04:50.170> it<00:04:50.350> like<00:04:50.530> a

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
yellow on here if you can see it like a

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.190 
yellow on here if you can see it like a
little<00:04:50.950> piece<00:04:51.220> right<00:04:51.400> there<00:04:51.840> now<00:04:52.840> my<00:04:52.960> hands

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:53.200 
little piece right there now my hands

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.890 
little piece right there now my hands
are<00:04:53.380> all<00:04:53.500> green<00:04:54.030> so<00:04:55.030> I'm<00:04:55.090> not<00:04:55.240> really<00:04:55.420> sure<00:04:55.540> the

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
are all green so I'm not really sure the

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.180 
are all green so I'm not really sure the
yellow<00:04:56.020> doesn't<00:04:56.440> show<00:04:56.650> up<00:04:56.770> super<00:04:57.010> well<00:04:59.190> just

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
yellow doesn't show up super well just

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:36.619 
yellow doesn't show up super well just
take<00:05:00.460> this<00:05:00.670> piece<00:05:01.000> and<00:05:01.030> try<00:05:01.390> it

00:05:36.619 --> 00:05:36.629 

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:38.809 

so<00:05:37.259> you<00:05:37.409> can<00:05:37.589> kind<00:05:37.830> of<00:05:37.919> see<00:05:38.099> the<00:05:38.279> yellow<00:05:38.580> a

00:05:38.809 --> 00:05:38.819 
so you can kind of see the yellow a

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:41.719 
so you can kind of see the yellow a
little<00:05:38.999> bit<00:05:39.330> and<00:05:39.979> then<00:05:40.979> they<00:05:41.159> kind<00:05:41.369> of<00:05:41.490> just

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:41.729 
little bit and then they kind of just

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:44.329 
little bit and then they kind of just
hold<00:05:41.879> it<00:05:42.119> in<00:05:42.270> you<00:05:43.259> can<00:05:43.439> take<00:05:43.679> your<00:05:43.860> curling

00:05:44.329 --> 00:05:44.339 
hold it in you can take your curling

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:48.079 
hold it in you can take your curling
iron<00:05:44.520> and<00:05:45.059> not<00:05:45.360> bring<00:05:45.629> yourself<00:05:46.969> curling<00:05:47.969> in

00:05:48.079 --> 00:05:48.089 
iron and not bring yourself curling in

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:52.059 
iron and not bring yourself curling in
and<00:05:48.419> then<00:05:48.569> just<00:05:48.899> kind<00:05:49.169> of<00:05:49.259> run<00:05:49.619> it<00:05:50.119> through<00:05:51.119> the

00:05:52.059 --> 00:05:52.069 
and then just kind of run it through the

00:05:52.069 --> 00:05:54.709 
and then just kind of run it through the
the<00:05:53.069> color<00:05:53.309> and<00:05:53.789> that<00:05:53.909> kind<00:05:54.209> of<00:05:54.300> just<00:05:54.509> like

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:00.770 
hold it in a little bit and then they're

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.230 
hold it in a little bit and then they're
washable<00:06:02.029> chalks

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 
washable chalks

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.969 
washable chalks
like<00:06:03.449> it<00:06:03.659> will<00:06:03.839> come<00:06:03.869> off<00:06:04.199> the<00:06:04.379> sidewalk<00:06:04.770> if

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:04.979 
like it will come off the sidewalk if

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:08.089 
like it will come off the sidewalk if
you<00:06:05.129> use<00:06:05.249> them<00:06:05.399> on<00:06:05.490> the<00:06:05.610> sidewalk<00:06:05.990> so<00:06:07.099> you

00:06:08.089 --> 00:06:08.099 
you use them on the sidewalk so you

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:09.439 
you use them on the sidewalk so you
should<00:06:08.399> come<00:06:08.610> out<00:06:08.639> of<00:06:08.849> your<00:06:09.059> hair<00:06:09.240> pretty

00:06:33.379 --> 00:06:33.389 
just kind of sets it in there so that

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:39.020 
just kind of sets it in there so that
it'll<00:06:34.319> stay<00:06:34.620> longer<00:06:37.610> so<00:06:38.610> it's<00:06:38.759> really<00:06:38.879> easy

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:39.030

and it's just fun to like I don't know
