00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
this is the tip of the week and it's

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:04.610 
this is the tip of the week and it's
about<00:00:02.330> vertical<00:00:03.330> buttonholes<00:00:03.629> I<00:00:04.200> realized

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
about vertical buttonholes I realized

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.030 
about vertical buttonholes I realized
when<00:00:05.490> I<00:00:05.520> was<00:00:05.640> hey<00:00:06.299> George<00:00:06.620> when<00:00:07.620> I<00:00:07.649> was

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
when I was hey George when I was

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.959 
when I was hey George when I was
teaching<00:00:09.030> this<00:00:09.389> past<00:00:10.130> conference<00:00:11.130> that<00:00:11.820> I<00:00:11.849> had

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
teaching this past conference that I had

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.990 
teaching this past conference that I had
not<00:00:12.090> done<00:00:12.150> a<00:00:12.330> video<00:00:12.540> for<00:00:12.870> this<00:00:13.019> it's<00:00:13.290> kind<00:00:13.500> of

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:14.000 
not done a video for this it's kind of

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.939 
not done a video for this it's kind of
obvious<00:00:15.000> but<00:00:15.030> you<00:00:15.420> never<00:00:15.570> know<00:00:15.750> I'm<00:00:16.740> going<00:00:16.920> to

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
obvious but you never know I'm going to

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.680 
obvious but you never know I'm going to
do<00:00:17.070> a<00:00:17.100> vertical<00:00:17.310> buttonhole<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:17.940> when<00:00:18.570> you're

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
do a vertical buttonhole and when you're

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:19.670 
do a vertical buttonhole and when you're
talking<00:00:18.960> about<00:00:19.080> vertical<00:00:19.439> or<00:00:19.650> horizontal

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
talking about vertical or horizontal

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.470 
talking about vertical or horizontal
buttonholes<00:00:20.609> it<00:00:20.789> doesn't<00:00:21.060> mean<00:00:21.180> how<00:00:21.330> they

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
buttonholes it doesn't mean how they

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.000 
buttonholes it doesn't mean how they
appear<00:00:21.810> on<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:21.990> garment<00:00:22.350> that<00:00:22.560> means<00:00:22.800> how

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
appear on the garment that means how

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.109 
appear on the garment that means how
they're<00:00:23.160> worked<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.580> this<00:00:23.640> is<00:00:23.789> going<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:24.000> be

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
they're worked and this is going to be

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.189 
they're worked and this is going to be
vertical<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.750> my<00:00:24.869> stitches<00:00:25.880> so<00:00:26.880> that's<00:00:27.300> why<00:00:27.570> it

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
vertical to my stitches so that's why it

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.900 
vertical to my stitches so that's why it
is<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.439> vertical<00:00:28.769> hey<00:00:29.250> George

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
is a vertical hey George

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.280 
is a vertical hey George
why<00:00:30.449> it's<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.689> vertical<00:00:30.869> buttonhole<00:00:31.560> and

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 
why it's a vertical buttonhole and

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.080 
why it's a vertical buttonhole and
basically<00:00:34.290> you<00:00:35.100> work<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.550> where<00:00:35.670> you<00:00:35.760> want<00:00:35.969> the

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
basically you work to where you want the

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.850 
basically you work to where you want the
buttonhole<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.630> start<00:00:36.870> age<00:00:37.260> Ricky<00:00:39.770> taking<00:00:40.770> a

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
buttonhole the start age Ricky taking a

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:48.500 
buttonhole the start age Ricky taking a
nap<00:00:41.070> okay<00:00:44.000> and<00:00:45.230> you<00:00:46.230> drop<00:00:46.969> one<00:00:47.969> ball<00:00:48.239> of<00:00:48.270> yarn

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
nap okay and you drop one ball of yarn

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.119 
nap okay and you drop one ball of yarn
now<00:00:48.870> typically<00:00:49.320> you'd<00:00:49.469> be<00:00:49.590> doing<00:00:49.800> isn't<00:00:50.070> the

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
now typically you'd be doing isn't the

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.049 
now typically you'd be doing isn't the
same<00:00:50.340> Molly

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
same Molly

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.479 
same Molly

you just work in the new with a new ball
of<00:01:19.409> yarn<00:01:19.500> now<00:01:19.860> in<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.520> real<00:01:20.700> project<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:21.210> course

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
of yarn now in a real project of course

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.570 
of yarn now in a real project of course
this<00:01:21.570> would<00:01:21.720> be<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.960> same<00:01:22.170> color<00:01:22.470> okay<00:01:23.100> you

this would be the same color okay you

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:32.220 
this would be the same color okay you
just<00:01:23.640> turn<00:01:25.040> and<00:01:26.659> you<00:01:27.659> work

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:32.230 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.310 

as<00:01:32.820> many<00:01:33.820> rows<00:01:34.120> as<00:01:34.150> you<00:01:34.600> want<00:01:34.780> the<00:01:34.930> buttonhole

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
as many rows as you want the buttonhole

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.750 
as many rows as you want the buttonhole
to<00:01:35.440> be<00:01:35.590> now<00:01:35.800> the<00:01:35.860> thing<00:01:36.160> that's<00:01:36.340> important<00:01:36.730> to

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:36.760 
to be now the thing that's important to

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.370 
to be now the thing that's important to
realize<00:01:37.120> about<00:01:37.300> a<00:01:37.420> vertical<00:01:37.660> buttonhole<00:01:38.230> is

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
realize about a vertical buttonhole is

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.270 
realize about a vertical buttonhole is
it<00:01:38.620> is<00:01:38.740> not<00:01:39.010> very<00:01:39.340> strong<00:01:39.730> it's<00:01:40.480> a<00:01:40.810> pretty<00:01:41.590> limp

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
it is not very strong it's a pretty limp

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.650 
it is not very strong it's a pretty limp
okay<00:01:43.060> I<00:01:43.470> worked<00:01:44.470> pick<00:01:45.190> up<00:01:45.310> the<00:01:45.430> new<00:01:45.580> color<00:01:45.880> or

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:46.660 
okay I worked pick up the new color or

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:55.680 
okay I worked pick up the new color or
the<00:01:46.870> original<00:01:47.650> ball<00:01:48.010> of<00:01:48.190> yarn<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:54.480> work<00:01:55.480> to

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
the original ball of yarn and work to

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.960 
the original ball of yarn and work to
the<00:01:55.810> end<00:01:56.100> but<00:01:57.100> again<00:01:57.340> this<00:01:57.490> isn't<00:01:57.670> a<00:01:57.790> very

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
the end but again this isn't a very

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.360 
the end but again this isn't a very
strong<00:01:58.300> buttonhole<00:01:58.840> it<00:01:59.140> is<00:01:59.410> an<00:01:59.560> excellent

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:00.370 
strong buttonhole it is an excellent

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.670 
strong buttonhole it is an excellent
buttonhole<00:02:00.880> for<00:02:01.150> oversized<00:02:01.720> large<00:02:02.170> buttons

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
buttonhole for oversized large buttons

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.920 
buttonhole for oversized large buttons
because<00:02:03.280> it's<00:02:03.550> very<00:02:03.790> easy<00:02:04.150> to<00:02:04.300> make<00:02:04.480> it<00:02:04.540> big

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
because it's very easy to make it big

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.980 
because it's very easy to make it big
unlike<00:02:05.500> eyelet<00:02:06.040> buttonholes<00:02:06.610> and<00:02:07.060> it's

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
unlike eyelet buttonholes and it's

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.620 
unlike eyelet buttonholes and it's
easier<00:02:08.350> to<00:02:08.500> work<00:02:08.649> than<00:02:09.010> a<00:02:09.510> horizontal<00:02:10.510> one

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
easier to work than a horizontal one

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.240 
easier to work than a horizontal one
which<00:02:10.869> I'll<00:02:11.050> do<00:02:11.200> next<00:02:11.410> week<00:02:11.680> I<00:02:11.890> don't<00:02:11.950> think

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
which I'll do next week I don't think

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.470 
which I'll do next week I don't think
I've<00:02:12.400> done<00:02:12.580> that<00:02:12.820> one<00:02:13.000> yet

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
I've done that one yet

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.420 
I've done that one yet
I'm<00:02:14.350> just<00:02:14.500> going<00:02:14.620> to<00:02:14.650> make<00:02:14.770> this<00:02:14.950> a<00:02:15.010> few<00:02:15.250> more

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
I'm just going to make this a few more

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.910 
I'm just going to make this a few more
rows<00:02:15.610> now<00:02:15.970> the<00:02:16.750> most<00:02:16.930> important<00:02:17.500> thing<00:02:17.680> about

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
rows now the most important thing about

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.360 
rows now the most important thing about
this<00:02:18.490> guy<00:02:18.760> is<00:02:19.230> that<00:02:20.230> when<00:02:20.500> you<00:02:20.740> are<00:02:20.890> done<00:02:21.130> with

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
this guy is that when you are done with

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.730 
this guy is that when you are done with
it<00:02:21.400> you<00:02:22.390> do<00:02:22.600> some<00:02:23.110> clean<00:02:23.410> up<00:02:25.230> with<00:02:26.230> those<00:02:26.440> yarn

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
it you do some clean up with those yarn

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.260 
it you do some clean up with those yarn
tails<00:02:27.010> so<00:02:27.250> you<00:02:27.310> want<00:02:27.550> to<00:02:27.610> make<00:02:27.760> sure<00:02:27.790> that

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
tails so you want to make sure that

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:37.830 
tails so you want to make sure that
those<00:02:28.450> yarn<00:02:28.750> tails<00:02:29.700> are<00:02:30.700> nice<00:02:31.480> and<00:02:31.720> long

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.250 

and<00:02:39.040> you<00:02:40.040> can<00:02:40.190> use<00:02:40.310> them<00:02:40.459> to<00:02:40.550> strengthen<00:02:41.020> or<00:02:42.020> to

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
and you can use them to strengthen or to

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.780 
and you can use them to strengthen or to
make<00:02:42.440> the<00:02:42.560> buttonhole<00:02:42.890> smaller<00:02:43.220> and<00:02:43.400> as<00:02:43.490> I

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
make the buttonhole smaller and as I

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.010 
make the buttonhole smaller and as I
said<00:02:44.000> one<00:02:44.209> of<00:02:44.240> the<00:02:44.390> problems<00:02:44.510> I<00:02:44.810> have<00:02:44.990> with

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
said one of the problems I have with

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.750 
said one of the problems I have with
this<00:02:45.200> buttonhole<00:02:45.650> is<00:02:45.680> it<00:02:45.920> always<00:02:46.069> seems<00:02:46.459> to<00:02:46.640> be

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
this buttonhole is it always seems to be

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.100 
this buttonhole is it always seems to be
bigger<00:02:47.080> than<00:02:48.080> I<00:02:48.110> had<00:02:48.560> originally<00:02:48.680> planned

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
bigger than I had originally planned

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.360 
bigger than I had originally planned
it's<00:02:51.110> hard<00:02:51.410> to<00:02:51.530> get<00:02:51.680> it<00:02:51.800> to<00:02:51.830> be<00:02:52.040> right<00:02:52.190> the

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
it's hard to get it to be right the

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.760 
it's hard to get it to be right the
right<00:02:52.580> size<00:02:52.910> so<00:02:53.660> I'll<00:02:53.750> do<00:02:53.930> one<00:02:54.140> more<00:02:54.170> row<00:02:54.530> and

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
right size so I'll do one more row and

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.720 
right size so I'll do one more row and
then<00:02:54.860> I'll<00:02:54.980> finish<00:02:55.250> it<00:02:55.520> off<00:02:57.489> George<00:02:58.489> you<00:02:58.610> got

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
then I'll finish it off George you got

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.130 
then I'll finish it off George you got
an<00:02:58.819> embarrassment<00:02:59.180> of<00:02:59.420> riches<00:02:59.480> down<00:02:59.930> there

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
an embarrassment of riches down there

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.760 
an embarrassment of riches down there
with<00:03:00.290> yarn

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
with yarn

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:08.500

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
size that you want what you do in a turn

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.259 
size that you want what you do in a turn
is<00:03:30.050> you<00:03:30.590> just<00:03:30.830> simply<00:03:31.190> drop<00:03:31.489> the<00:03:31.730> second<00:03:32.090> ball

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
of yarn and you continue to work with

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.300 
of yarn and you continue to work with
your<00:03:34.819> first<00:03:35.060> ball<00:03:35.300> of<00:03:35.420> yarn<00:03:35.800> now<00:03:36.800> again<00:03:37.130> the

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
leave long long tails because I see I'm

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.530 
leave long long tails because I see I'm
just<00:03:48.620> going<00:03:48.890> to<00:03:48.950> continue<00:03:49.130> working<00:03:49.730> with<00:03:50.030> in

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
just going to continue working with in

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.569 
just going to continue working with in
pattern<00:03:51.380> whatever<00:03:51.709> the<00:03:51.890> pattern<00:03:52.040> is<00:03:52.340> that's

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
established I'm going to one more row

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.660 
established I'm going to one more row
that<00:03:57.260> you<00:03:57.500> have<00:03:57.680> that<00:03:57.860> tail<00:03:58.190> long<00:03:58.400> because

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
that you have that tail long because

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
that you have that tail long because
you're<00:03:58.760> going<00:03:58.880> to<00:03:58.940> be<00:03:59.000> using<00:03:59.180> it<00:03:59.420> for<00:03:59.450> some

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
you're going to be using it for some

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.800 
you're going to be using it for some
cleanup<00:03:59.959> and<00:04:00.410> in<00:04:01.190> the<00:04:01.970> blog<00:04:02.360> I'll<00:04:02.600> have<00:04:02.780> a

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
cleanup and in the blog I'll have a

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.800 
cleanup and in the blog I'll have a
photo<00:04:03.110> of<00:04:03.200> this<00:04:03.500> with<00:04:04.489> the<00:04:04.820> cleanup<00:04:05.450> that<00:04:05.480> I've

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
photo of this with the cleanup that I've

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:06.340 
photo of this with the cleanup that I've
done

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
done

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.680 
done
I'm<00:04:06.530> not<00:04:06.739> going<00:04:06.950> to<00:04:07.060> videotape<00:04:08.060> the<00:04:08.450> cleanup

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
I'm not going to videotape the cleanup

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:14.800 
I'm not going to videotape the cleanup
as<00:04:10.090> the<00:04:11.090> video<00:04:11.359> would<00:04:11.600> be<00:04:11.660> too<00:04:11.780> long<00:04:11.959> so<00:04:13.810> just

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
as the video would be too long so just

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:21.409 
as the video would be too long so just
going<00:04:15.200> to<00:04:15.290> work<00:04:15.709> one<00:04:15.890> more<00:04:16.100> row<00:04:16.310> across

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.120 

now<00:04:22.419> again<00:04:22.780> what<00:04:23.080> this<00:04:23.259> is<00:04:23.440> particularly<00:04:23.919> good

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
now again what this is particularly good

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.379 
now again what this is particularly good
for<00:04:24.460> is<00:04:24.639> a<00:04:24.669> large<00:04:25.330> button<00:04:25.900> and<00:04:27.330> this<00:04:28.330> button

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:28.389 
for is a large button and this button

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:30.659 
for is a large button and this button
hole<00:04:28.810> does<00:04:29.020> tend<00:04:29.380> to<00:04:29.470> stretch<00:04:29.800> out<00:04:30.069> a<00:04:30.099> bit<00:04:30.220> too

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
hole does tend to stretch out a bit too

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:33.150 
hole does tend to stretch out a bit too
and<00:04:31.120> you<00:04:31.509> can<00:04:31.720> see<00:04:31.990> about<00:04:32.560> my<00:04:32.710> buttonholes

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
and you can see about my buttonholes

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.320 
and you can see about my buttonholes
there<00:04:33.400> and<00:04:33.669> that<00:04:33.819> is<00:04:33.970> a<00:04:34.000> pretty<00:04:34.240> big

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
there and that is a pretty big

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.870 
there and that is a pretty big
buttonhole<00:04:34.990> but<00:04:35.919> notice<00:04:36.280> that<00:04:36.430> it's<00:04:36.819> very

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
buttonhole but notice that it's very

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.670 
buttonhole but notice that it's very
flimsy<00:04:37.419> because<00:04:37.750> it's<00:04:38.020> just<00:04:38.199> a<00:04:38.289> selvage

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
flimsy because it's just a selvage

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.240 
flimsy because it's just a selvage
stitch<00:04:38.919> on<00:04:39.160> the<00:04:39.280> side<00:04:39.520> and<00:04:40.199> it<00:04:41.199> also<00:04:41.380> is<00:04:41.800> maybe

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
stitch on the side and it also is maybe
