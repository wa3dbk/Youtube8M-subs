00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.850
 He will probably be one more match in the second race 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:07.020
 I very exciting his name but when we start with 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.969
 we still have 0 sam year 10 you get but when the first half comes am happy 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.550
 that you can get the super farmers lead and yes it was nice to have it 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.240
 was a difficult start for us 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.790
 the first half, certainly the first twenty minutes of waregem me played well 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.210
 football something with half what is that 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.109
 we were very hungry 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:29.210
 but still mark rutte in the form 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.899
 and just there she was still motivated 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:33.620
 in the plow content 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.390
 then just with a head start to the dressing room 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.990
 0 2 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:39.530
 in the end 0 3 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.270
 and then in 3 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.740
 2 3 and then it was still exciting 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.350
 and where I had a little seasickness 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.300
 that we can play or lose cincinnati again 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.330
 but once started and it does very well for us for the team of the 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:54.890
 supporters for everyone 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.550
 in the water that is called itself 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.710
 also borrow less that requires short which diesel to plant making it whole 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.950
 yes that is that I am indeed indeed short in the eleventh game already 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:04.739
 played 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.820
 because that is different so you also lose or tie differently 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.470
 so I thought the team performed well today even though it wasn't one of them 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:13.790
 our best competitions 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.110
 but have shown that your mentality have character and that became 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.240
 nevertheless touched that we can win 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.490
 first goal was with a copy of which initially against tomorrow 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:23.220
 to lure 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.910
 yes i found that in this one too 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.630
 I am very happy with these products of course 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.820
 but I also got the no content with the win that we 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.120
 have achieved today because it sure nos 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.640
 and for the next week also gives us proposals too 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.909
 he said then the team came to the 30 celebration that there is a lot in mosul and 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:41.440
 one tenth percent 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.160
 Yes indeed 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.160
 micro all came together to say hello everything broke 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.020
 yet Groningen concerts if you already have that then a month after 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.830
 like pauli 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.990
 the share from behind city that if allowed then made it 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.650
 raw material to Schiphol 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.530
 and we did very well today to show that they are theirs 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.490
 mentality and character 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.649
 the supporters were more able to sanderock behind the team but also one 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:08.179
 nice to be able to celebrate him afterwards 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.369
 of course she did not expect that is what we see today 

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:13.699
 I thought maybe a somewhat vague talman 

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:15.399
 but that was much more 

00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:18.569
 and then the victory was well under control 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.770
 We show and that we could celebrate more and of course that it was about one 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:23.659
 in the stands 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:25.359
 who won the name 

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:29.019
 it anyway a man from the stands yes of course always stays around the cios 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.649
 The fastest thing to keep is that he could take the team out of the team or 

00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:34.239
 continues to play vantomme 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.040
 In May, beach day remember that they still have the cabin with these products 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.439
 a fair price per type sees a perspective in this competition 

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:41.519
 loss 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.519
 yes I hope so, but we should not be too fast now 

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:48.699
 how should we stay on CD and stay on the ground two feet on the ground 

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:52.379
 and hope that next week they also have a good club if the performance comes down to you 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:53.589
 and you can win 

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:56.419
 And then there was a future that only has one game per game 

00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:57.129
 see 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:58.410
 more 50 percent
