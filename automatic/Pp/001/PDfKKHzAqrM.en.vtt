00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
this is a plant that tends to get more

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.410 
this is a plant that tends to get more
flowers<00:02:27.040> on<00:02:27.370> the<00:02:27.459> end<00:02:27.550> it's<00:02:27.700> a<00:02:27.790> beautiful

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
flowers on the end it's a beautiful

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.630 
flowers on the end it's a beautiful

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
plant most people don't use it and they

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.699 
plant most people don't use it and they
should<00:02:30.700> use<00:02:31.060> it<00:02:31.239> more<00:02:31.269> but<00:02:32.080> to<00:02:32.290> make<00:02:32.410> a<00:02:32.440> push

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
should use it more but to make a push

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.410 
should use it more but to make a push
out<00:02:32.890> and<00:02:33.130> make<00:02:33.310> more<00:02:33.550> growth<00:02:33.849> to<00:02:34.060> note<00:02:34.209> back

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
out and make more growth to note back

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.020 
out and make more growth to note back
here<00:02:34.750> just<00:02:35.680> better<00:02:35.830> prune<00:02:36.190> off<00:02:36.400> the<00:02:36.640> ends<00:02:36.790> of

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
here just better prune off the ends of

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.289 
here just better prune off the ends of
it<00:02:37.709> and<00:02:38.709> that<00:02:39.340> will<00:02:39.459> force<00:02:39.730> growth<00:02:40.060> out

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
it and that will force growth out

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:41.580 
it and that will force growth out
through<00:02:40.690> the<00:02:40.780> back<00:02:40.930> seat<00:02:41.230> and<00:02:41.319> get<00:02:41.440> more

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
through the back seat and get more

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.699 
through the back seat and get more
