keep looking through there and so the

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.750 
keep looking through there and so the
version<00:00:55.880> is<00:00:56.060> somewhat<00:00:56.480> nice<00:00:56.720> that<00:00:57.260> if<00:00:58.070> when

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
version is somewhat nice that if when

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.290 
version is somewhat nice that if when
you<00:00:58.880> pick<00:00:59.120> up<00:00:59.270> their<00:00:59.600> hair<00:01:00.070> try<00:01:01.070> to<00:01:01.129> hold<00:01:02.030> it

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
you pick up their hair try to hold it

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.820 
you pick up their hair try to hold it
kind<00:01:02.540> of<00:01:02.660> loosely<00:01:03.080> against<00:01:03.470> their<00:01:03.680> head

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:03.830 
kind of loosely against their head

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.969 
kind of loosely against their head
because<00:01:04.699> the<00:01:04.990> short<00:01:05.990> hair<00:01:06.290> is<00:01:06.440> under<00:01:06.710> here<00:01:06.830> by

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
because the short hair is under here by

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.880 
because the short hair is under here by
the<00:01:07.040> neck<00:01:07.310> are<00:01:07.520> very<00:01:07.880> sensitive<00:01:08.810> and<00:01:09.560> when<00:01:09.619> you

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
the neck are very sensitive and when you

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.150 
the neck are very sensitive and when you
pull<00:01:10.220> out<00:01:10.400> it<00:01:11.330> kind<00:01:11.570> of<00:01:11.600> hurts<00:01:11.840> doesn't<00:01:12.110> it<00:01:12.350> so

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:13.160 
pull out it kind of hurts doesn't it so

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.249 
pull out it kind of hurts doesn't it so
we<00:01:13.820> try<00:01:14.090> not<00:01:14.300> to<00:01:14.420> do<00:01:14.570> so<00:01:15.260> then<00:01:15.470> we<00:01:15.790> do<00:01:16.790> a<00:01:16.850> little

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
we try not to do so then we do a little

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:24.820 
we try not to do so then we do a little
angler<00:01:18.259> burst<00:01:21.910> and<00:01:23.110> sometimes<00:01:24.110> I<00:01:24.259> found<00:01:24.590> it's

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
angler burst and sometimes I found it's

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.350
