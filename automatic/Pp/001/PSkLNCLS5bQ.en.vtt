00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.179 
they made something like that before I
think<00:01:45.509> I<00:01:45.720> don't<00:01:45.930> really<00:01:46.170> know<00:01:46.409> their<00:01:46.950> games

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
think I don't really know their games

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.569 
think I don't really know their games
outside<00:01:47.490> of<00:01:48.079> the<00:01:49.079> Naruto<00:01:49.409> game<00:01:49.770> so<00:01:50.070> maybe<00:01:50.369> they

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
outside of the Naruto game so maybe they

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:51.800 
outside of the Naruto game so maybe they
could<00:01:50.759> make<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:50.939> game<00:01:51.149> like<00:01:51.360> that<00:01:51.390> who<00:01:51.630> knows

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
could make a game like that who knows

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.469 
could make a game like that who knows
but<00:01:52.470> um<00:01:52.680> I<00:01:53.070> know<00:01:53.460> that<00:01:53.610> they're<00:01:53.909> made<00:01:54.180> or

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
but um I know that they're made or

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.050 
but um I know that they're made or
they're<00:01:54.899> mainly<00:01:55.619> known<00:01:55.799> at<00:01:56.100> least<00:01:56.280> for<00:01:56.460> me<00:01:56.610> for

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
they're mainly known at least for me for

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.270 
they're mainly known at least for me for
making<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:58.020> Naruto<00:01:58.350> storm<00:01:58.680> games<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.189> those

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
making the Naruto storm games and those

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.630 
making the Naruto storm games and those
games<00:01:59.549> are<00:01:59.700> awesome<00:02:00.270> they're<00:02:00.390> very<00:02:00.570> very<00:02:00.780> fun

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
games are awesome they're very very fun

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.100 
games are awesome they're very very fun
but<00:02:02.640> could<00:02:02.820> they<00:02:02.909> make<00:02:03.060> an<00:02:03.210> attack<00:02:03.509> on<00:02:03.630> Titan

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
but could they make an attack on Titan

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.170 
but could they make an attack on Titan
game<00:02:04.320> I<00:02:04.590> don't<00:02:05.399> know<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:05.729> I<00:02:05.790> don't<00:02:05.880> think<00:02:06.000> I

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
game I don't know and I don't think I

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.560 
game I don't know and I don't think I
want<00:02:06.450> one<00:02:06.540> to<00:02:06.780> be<00:02:06.810> honest

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
want one to be honest

are just automatically on board with an

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.290 
are just automatically on board with an
attack<00:02:14.830> on<00:02:14.980> saying<00:02:15.220> if<00:02:15.430> they<00:02:15.520> want<00:02:15.820> an<00:02:16.030> attack

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
on certain games so fucking bad but me

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.470 
on certain games so fucking bad but me
personally<00:02:19.540> I<00:02:20.010> don't<00:02:21.010> see<00:02:21.880> how<00:02:22.120> it<00:02:22.300> could<00:02:22.450> work

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
personally I don't see how it could work

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.650 
personally I don't see how it could work
now<00:02:23.410> if<00:02:23.620> it's<00:02:23.800> a<00:02:23.950> game<00:02:24.250> sort<00:02:24.670> of<00:02:24.820> like<00:02:25.209> that<00:02:25.390> web

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
now if it's a game sort of like that web

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.780 
now if it's a game sort of like that web
game<00:02:25.900> that<00:02:26.050> I've<00:02:26.170> been<00:02:26.590> talking<00:02:26.860> about<00:02:27.160> then<00:02:27.760> I

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
game that I've been talking about then I

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.430 
game that I've been talking about then I
can<00:02:28.030> see<00:02:28.209> it<00:02:28.330> working<00:02:28.570> because<00:02:28.900> that's<00:02:29.080> very

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
can see it working because that's very

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.750 
can see it working because that's very
fun<00:02:29.709> there's<00:02:29.920> a<00:02:29.980> lot<00:02:30.010> of<00:02:30.220> strategy<00:02:30.610> that's

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
fun there's a lot of strategy that's

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.340 
fun there's a lot of strategy that's
involved<00:02:31.120> and<00:02:31.270> you<00:02:31.420> know<00:02:31.570> you<00:02:31.630> can<00:02:31.990> do<00:02:32.080> co-op

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
involved and you know you can do co-op

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:33.930 
involved and you know you can do co-op
and<00:02:32.620> stuff<00:02:32.800> with<00:02:32.920> your<00:02:33.010> friends<00:02:33.100> and<00:02:33.550> I<00:02:33.760> think

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
and stuff with your friends and I think

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.790 
and stuff with your friends and I think
that<00:02:34.060> could<00:02:34.180> work<00:02:34.209> really<00:02:34.510> well<00:02:34.780> however<00:02:35.709> a

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
that could work really well however a

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.590 
that could work really well however a
lot<00:02:36.040> of<00:02:36.070> people<00:02:36.190> wants<00:02:36.670> an<00:02:36.790> attack<00:02:37.090> on<00:02:37.270> Titan

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
lot of people wants an attack on Titan

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.560 
lot of people wants an attack on Titan
fighting<00:02:38.230> game<00:02:38.410> and<00:02:38.850> that<00:02:39.850> I<00:02:40.090> don't<00:02:40.150> think<00:02:40.450> is

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
fighting game and that I don't think is

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.000 
fighting game and that I don't think is
going<00:02:40.750> to<00:02:40.840> work<00:02:41.080> and<00:02:41.350> the<00:02:41.440> main<00:02:41.590> reason<00:02:41.620> being

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
going to work and the main reason being

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.979 
going to work and the main reason being
is<00:02:42.250> because<00:02:42.430> fighting<00:02:43.330> games<00:02:43.630> are<00:02:43.780> generally

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
is because fighting games are generally

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:48.800 
is because fighting games are generally
small<00:02:44.739> and<00:02:44.980> scale<00:02:45.340> and<00:02:46.770> attack<00:02:47.770> on<00:02:47.950> Titan<00:02:48.370> is

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
small and scale and attack on Titan is

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.290 
small and scale and attack on Titan is
huge<00:02:49.810> in<00:02:50.110> scale<00:02:50.260> literally<00:02:51.220> like<00:02:51.670> the<00:02:51.970> Titans

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
huge in scale literally like the Titans

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.540 
huge in scale literally like the Titans
are<00:02:52.450> ginormous<00:02:53.080> and<00:02:53.650> if<00:02:54.220> you're<00:02:54.340> talking

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
are ginormous and if you're talking

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.090 
are ginormous and if you're talking
about<00:02:54.820> a<00:02:55.030> fighting<00:02:55.600> game<00:02:55.810> for<00:02:56.680> attack<00:02:56.920> on

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
about a fighting game for attack on

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.060 
about a fighting game for attack on
Titan<00:02:57.489> I<00:02:57.670> don't<00:02:58.120> think<00:02:58.300> that's<00:02:58.420> going<00:02:58.600> to<00:02:58.720> work

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
Titan I don't think that's going to work

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.040 
Titan I don't think that's going to work
mainly<00:03:00.070> because<00:03:00.550> one<00:03:00.910> that's<00:03:01.330> not<00:03:01.540> really

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
mainly because one that's not really

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.780 
mainly because one that's not really
what<00:03:02.260> attack<00:03:02.500> on<00:03:02.650> Titan<00:03:02.950> is<00:03:03.070> about<00:03:03.459> there's

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
what attack on Titan is about there's

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.280 
what attack on Titan is about there's
not<00:03:03.970> really<00:03:04.239> you<00:03:04.390> know<00:03:04.420> one-on-one<00:03:05.019> fights

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
not really you know one-on-one fights

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.800 
not really you know one-on-one fights
between<00:03:05.830> you<00:03:06.760> know<00:03:06.880> people<00:03:07.239> using<00:03:07.540> the<00:03:07.600> third

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
between you know people using the third

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.960 
between you know people using the third
maneuver<00:03:08.230> gear<00:03:08.290> and<00:03:08.560> even<00:03:08.739> if<00:03:08.800> there<00:03:08.950> was<00:03:09.340> it's

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
maneuver gear and even if there was it's

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.580 
maneuver gear and even if there was it's
hard<00:03:10.060> to<00:03:10.360> implement<00:03:10.690> the<00:03:10.959> third<00:03:11.170> maneuver

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
hard to implement the third maneuver

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.530 
hard to implement the third maneuver
gear<00:03:11.730> into<00:03:12.730> a<00:03:13.060> fighting<00:03:13.660> game<00:03:14.040> simply<00:03:15.040> because

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
gear into a fighting game simply because

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.880 
gear into a fighting game simply because
fighting<00:03:16.540> games<00:03:16.720> are<00:03:16.930> small<00:03:17.470> in<00:03:17.620> scale

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
fighting games are small in scale

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.550 
fighting games are small in scale
whereas<00:03:18.489> attack<00:03:18.820> on<00:03:19.000> Titan<00:03:19.330> is<00:03:19.450> huge<00:03:20.140> so<00:03:20.530> I

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
whereas attack on Titan is huge so I

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.690 
whereas attack on Titan is huge so I
don't<00:03:20.799> know<00:03:20.890> how<00:03:21.040> that's<00:03:21.190> gonna<00:03:21.370> translate

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
don't know how that's gonna translate

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.420 
don't know how that's gonna translate
well<00:03:22.150> enough<00:03:22.480> if<00:03:23.230> it's<00:03:23.440> going<00:03:23.590> to<00:03:23.739> be<00:03:23.860> a<00:03:23.890> co-op

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
well enough if it's going to be a co-op

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.420 
well enough if it's going to be a co-op
only<00:03:24.790> game<00:03:25.060> then<00:03:25.660> maybe<00:03:25.989> you<00:03:26.470> know<00:03:26.590> I'd<00:03:27.250> be

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
only game then maybe you know I'd be

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:28.710 
only game then maybe you know I'd be
pretty<00:03:27.700> much<00:03:27.880> down<00:03:28.090> for<00:03:28.299> that<00:03:28.390> if<00:03:28.510> it's<00:03:28.630> a

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
pretty much down for that if it's a

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.660 
pretty much down for that if it's a
co-op<00:03:29.019> game<00:03:29.049> you<00:03:29.829> know<00:03:29.920> you<00:03:30.010> can't<00:03:30.190> you<00:03:30.340> get<00:03:30.489> to

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
co-op game you know you can't you get to

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.780 
co-op game you know you can't you get to
maybe<00:03:31.120> even<00:03:31.420> create<00:03:31.780> your<00:03:31.810> own<00:03:32.640> your<00:03:33.640> own

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
maybe even create your own your own

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.280 
maybe even create your own your own
character<00:03:34.329> or<00:03:34.540> something<00:03:34.810> like<00:03:34.900> that<00:03:34.959> maybe

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
character or something like that maybe

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.170 
character or something like that maybe
that<00:03:35.560> would<00:03:35.650> be<00:03:35.769> cool<00:03:36.070> or<00:03:36.430> even<00:03:36.700> just<00:03:36.730> using

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
that would be cool or even just using

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.120 
that would be cool or even just using
the<00:03:37.269> regular<00:03:37.510> old<00:03:37.840> cast<00:03:38.170> I<00:03:38.470> think<00:03:38.860> that<00:03:39.010> would

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
the regular old cast I think that would

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.330 
the regular old cast I think that would
be<00:03:39.160> great<00:03:39.400> as<00:03:39.640> well<00:03:39.820> but<00:03:40.060> in<00:03:40.720> general<00:03:41.620> I<00:03:41.890> think

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
be great as well but in general I think

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.699 
be great as well but in general I think
if<00:03:42.820> there<00:03:43.150> weren't<00:03:43.510> going<00:03:44.110> if<00:03:44.320> there<00:03:44.470> wasn't

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
if there weren't going if there wasn't

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:46.140 
if there weren't going if there wasn't
going<00:03:44.829> to<00:03:44.920> be<00:03:45.010> an<00:03:45.100> attack<00:03:45.340> constant<00:03:45.700> in<00:03:45.760> game<00:03:45.970> I

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
going to be an attack constant in game I

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.390 
going to be an attack constant in game I
wouldn't<00:03:46.420> be<00:03:46.600> losing<00:03:46.750> any<00:03:47.019> sleep<00:03:47.220> that's<00:03:48.220> just

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
wouldn't be losing any sleep that's just

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.250 
wouldn't be losing any sleep that's just
me<00:03:48.519> personally<00:03:48.760> I<00:03:49.120> know<00:03:49.239> a<00:03:49.390> lot<00:03:49.720> a<00:03:49.750> lot<00:03:50.049> of
