with those little mountains and valleys

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.330 
with those little mountains and valleys
so<00:01:59.030> that<00:01:59.149> I<00:01:59.180> have<00:01:59.479> the<00:01:59.659> space<00:01:59.899> is<00:02:00.140> in<00:02:00.320> there<00:02:00.619> to

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
so that I have the space is in there to

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.289 
so that I have the space is in there to
put<00:02:01.640> my<00:02:02.119> letters<00:02:02.509> into<00:02:03.670> so<00:02:04.670> what<00:02:04.850> I<00:02:04.880> mean<00:02:05.149> by

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
put my letters into so what I mean by

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:09.790 
put my letters into so what I mean by
that<00:02:05.330> is<00:02:05.539> I<00:02:06.170> wanted<00:02:07.100> to<00:02:07.220> have<00:02:07.460> a<00:02:07.970> full<00:02:08.959> open

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
that is I wanted to have a full open

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.009 
that is I wanted to have a full open
block<00:02:10.130> at<00:02:10.429> each<00:02:10.640> end<00:02:10.970> rather<00:02:11.269> than<00:02:11.480> going<00:02:11.690> down

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 
block at each end rather than going down

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:14.680 
block at each end rather than going down
to<00:02:12.290> make<00:02:12.440> a<00:02:12.470> V<00:02:13.090> so<00:02:14.090> I'm<00:02:14.180> going<00:02:14.300> to<00:02:14.330> lift<00:02:14.510> that

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
to make a V so I'm going to lift that

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.960 
to make a V so I'm going to lift that
off<00:02:14.750> and<00:02:15.319> then<00:02:16.250> I'm<00:02:16.370> going<00:02:16.459> to<00:02:16.519> turn<00:02:16.700> it<00:02:16.880> over

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
off and then I'm going to turn it over

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:27.220 
off and then I'm going to turn it over
line<00:02:19.970> it<00:02:20.150> up<00:02:20.269> to<00:02:20.330> make<00:02:20.630> the<00:02:20.810> squares<00:02:25.269> away<00:02:26.269> okay

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
line it up to make the squares away okay

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.720 
line it up to make the squares away okay
so<00:02:27.290> you<00:02:27.560> do<00:02:27.739> pick<00:02:27.950> up<00:02:28.100> a<00:02:28.190> little<00:02:28.400> bit<00:02:28.519> of<00:02:28.640> that

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
so you do pick up a little bit of that

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.280 
so you do pick up a little bit of that
texture<00:02:29.150> just<00:02:29.420> from<00:02:29.569> the<00:02:29.690> dust<00:02:29.870> and<00:02:30.140> things

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
texture just from the dust and things

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.690 
texture just from the dust and things
even<00:02:30.680> though<00:02:30.769> I<00:02:30.799> have<00:02:31.069> the<00:02:31.190> stamp<00:02:31.459> really

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
even though I have the stamp really

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.460 
even though I have the stamp really
clean<00:02:31.970> but<00:02:32.450> I<00:02:32.480> kind<00:02:32.720> of<00:02:32.780> like<00:02:32.989> the<00:02:33.140> texture

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
clean but I kind of like the texture

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.559 
clean but I kind of like the texture
that<00:02:33.680> adds<00:02:33.980> all<00:02:34.730> right<00:02:34.940> now<00:02:35.060> let's<00:02:35.239> go<00:02:35.450> ahead

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
that adds all right now let's go ahead

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:38.289 
that adds all right now let's go ahead
and<00:02:35.780> do<00:02:36.200> our<00:02:36.230> scoring<00:02:36.769> or<00:02:37.549> you<00:02:37.760> can<00:02:37.910> save<00:02:38.120> this

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299 
and do our scoring or you can save this

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:40.930 
and do our scoring or you can save this
to<00:02:38.510> the<00:02:38.600> end<00:02:39.010> so<00:02:40.010> I'm<00:02:40.280> just<00:02:40.459> going<00:02:40.610> to<00:02:40.670> go<00:02:40.730> ahead

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
to the end so I'm just going to go ahead

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.090 
to the end so I'm just going to go ahead
and<00:02:41.090> not<00:02:41.330> even<00:02:41.600> a<00:02:41.630> bother<00:02:41.840> measuring<00:02:42.530> but<00:02:43.070> I

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
and not even a bother measuring but I

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.400 
and not even a bother measuring but I
always<00:02:43.430> just<00:02:43.610> line<00:02:43.910> up<00:02:43.940> one<00:02:44.450> edge<00:02:44.750> of<00:02:45.170> my

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
always just line up one edge of my

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.470 
always just line up one edge of my
cardstock<00:02:45.769> with<00:02:46.220> one<00:02:46.400> of<00:02:46.519> those<00:02:46.640> tracks<00:02:47.090> I

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
cardstock with one of those tracks I

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.300 
cardstock with one of those tracks I
like<00:02:48.019> to<00:02:48.049> leave<00:02:48.290> a<00:02:48.350> little<00:02:48.530> space<00:02:48.829> at<00:02:49.190> the<00:02:49.220> top

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
like to leave a little space at the top

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.050 
like to leave a little space at the top
before<00:02:49.700> I<00:02:49.970> do<00:02:50.120> the<00:02:50.329> scoring<00:02:50.870> and<00:02:51.670> then<00:02:52.670> you're

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
before I do the scoring and then you're

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.360 
before I do the scoring and then you're
just<00:02:53.090> going<00:02:53.329> to<00:02:53.420> go<00:02:53.570> in<00:02:53.890> and<00:02:54.890> go<00:02:55.040> into<00:02:55.190> that

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
just going to go in and go into that

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.740 
just going to go in and go into that
score<00:02:55.760> a<00:02:55.790> couple<00:02:56.000> times<00:02:58.060> and<00:02:59.060> it<00:02:59.329> works<00:02:59.510> both

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
score a couple times and it works both

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.530 
score a couple times and it works both
ways<00:03:00.019> if<00:03:00.500> you<00:03:00.709> like<00:03:00.920> to<00:03:01.100> have<00:03:01.280> addy<00:03:01.579> boss<00:03:01.790> where

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
ways if you like to have addy boss where

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.780 
ways if you like to have addy boss where
it's<00:03:02.810> up<00:03:03.079> on<00:03:03.320> your<00:03:03.650> designs<00:03:04.010> you<00:03:04.400> can<00:03:04.430> do<00:03:04.670> that

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
it's up on your designs you can do that

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.400 
it's up on your designs you can do that
too<00:03:05.060> but<00:03:05.090> for<00:03:05.420> this<00:03:05.540> one<00:03:05.600> since<00:03:06.019> I<00:03:06.140> want<00:03:06.320> to

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.670 
too but for this one since I want to
have<00:03:06.500> it<00:03:06.620> centered<00:03:06.980> around<00:03:07.870> that<00:03:08.870> Chevron<00:03:09.500> I'm

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.250 
have it centered around that Chevron I'm
just<00:03:09.859> doing<00:03:10.130> it<00:03:10.220> this<00:03:10.370> way<00:03:11.019> so<00:03:12.019> I'm<00:03:12.079> going<00:03:12.230> to

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:25.170 
just doing it this way so I'm going to
line<00:03:12.440> it<00:03:12.470> up<00:03:12.650> with<00:03:12.709> that<00:03:12.950> same<00:03:13.190> track

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.250 

okay<00:03:26.560> all<00:03:27.560> right<00:03:27.740> now<00:03:28.930> I'm<00:03:29.930> going<00:03:30.080> to<00:03:30.140> go<00:03:30.230> ahead

and I'm going to put my letters right
over<00:03:35.030> this<00:03:35.920> how<00:03:36.920> to<00:03:36.980> spell<00:03:37.370> it<00:03:37.400> out<00:03:37.580> backwards

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
over this how to spell it out backwards

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:51.500 
over this how to spell it out backwards
so<00:03:40.370> got<00:03:41.300> the<00:03:41.480> edge<00:03:43.180> there's<00:03:44.180> the<00:03:44.300> T<00:03:47.410> H

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.929

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.619 
to do that with a smooth flat surface
but<00:04:13.950> this<00:04:14.159> is<00:04:14.280> just<00:04:14.310> a<00:04:14.549> really<00:04:14.819> easy<00:04:15.030> way<00:04:15.329> to<00:04:15.390> do

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:15.629 
but this is just a really easy way to do

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:20.110 
but this is just a really easy way to do
it<00:04:17.030> okay<00:04:18.030> so<00:04:18.539> we're<00:04:18.660> going<00:04:18.750> to<00:04:18.840> flip<00:04:18.989> that<00:04:19.169> over

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
it okay so we're going to flip that over

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.420 
it okay so we're going to flip that over
put<00:04:21.120> that<00:04:21.329> right<00:04:21.630> inside<00:04:22.229> those<00:04:22.470> boxes<00:04:22.710> and

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
put that right inside those boxes and

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:30.590 
put that right inside those boxes and
stamp<00:04:24.470> okay<00:04:25.490> now<00:04:26.870> i'm<00:04:27.870> going<00:04:28.139> to<00:04:28.229> take<00:04:29.600> my

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
stamp okay now i'm going to take my

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.779 
stamp okay now i'm going to take my
smaller<00:04:30.960> block<00:04:31.289> and<00:04:31.620> I<00:04:31.650> have<00:04:31.680> an<00:04:31.889> end<00:04:32.100> on<00:04:32.340> here

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:32.789 
smaller block and I have an end on here

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:36.080 
smaller block and I have an end on here
so<00:04:33.330> the<00:04:33.510> N<00:04:33.690> works<00:04:34.410> perfectly<00:04:35.039> as<00:04:35.310> an<00:04:35.490> R<00:04:35.699> so<00:04:36.030> you

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
so the N works perfectly as an R so you

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.230 
so the N works perfectly as an R so you
can<00:04:36.300> put<00:04:36.479> it<00:04:36.600> right<00:04:36.840> on<00:04:37.139> the<00:04:37.260> corner<00:04:37.530> of<00:04:38.240> that

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
can put it right on the corner of that

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.790 
can put it right on the corner of that
ink<00:04:39.389> pad<00:04:39.630> you<00:04:39.840> want<00:04:39.990> to<00:04:40.050> make<00:04:40.169> sure<00:04:40.199> it's<00:04:40.530> clean

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
ink pad you want to make sure it's clean

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.980 
ink pad you want to make sure it's clean
and<00:04:40.949> dry<00:04:41.190> to<00:04:41.490> begin<00:04:41.660> so<00:04:42.660> that<00:04:42.810> you're<00:04:42.960> not

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
and dry to begin so that you're not

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:48.100 
and dry to begin so that you're not
picking<00:04:43.350> up<00:04:43.590> any<00:04:43.830> other<00:04:44.510> ink<00:04:45.510> from<00:04:45.750> before<00:04:46.229> and

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
picking up any other ink from before and

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.390 
picking up any other ink from before and
you<00:04:49.110> can<00:04:49.229> pick<00:04:49.410> it<00:04:49.560> up<00:04:49.710> and<00:04:49.889> you'll<00:04:50.010> be<00:04:50.130> able<00:04:50.250> to

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
you can pick it up and you'll be able to

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.290 
you can pick it up and you'll be able to
see<00:04:51.020> where<00:04:52.020> it's<00:04:52.169> inked<00:04:52.850> so<00:04:53.850> you<00:04:53.910> just<00:04:53.940> add

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
see where it's inked so you just add

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.860 
see where it's inked so you just add
that<00:04:54.449> right<00:04:54.660> in<00:04:55.280> so<00:04:56.280> there's<00:04:56.490> your<00:04:56.550> are<00:04:56.880> and

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
that right in so there's your are and

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.670 
that right in so there's your are and
then<00:04:58.289> let's<00:04:58.470> go<00:04:58.650> ahead<00:04:58.680> and<00:04:58.919> do<00:05:00.650> tapping<00:05:01.650> that

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
then let's go ahead and do tapping that

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:09.800 
then let's go ahead and do tapping that
off<00:05:02.389> I'm<00:05:03.389> going<00:05:03.510> to<00:05:03.599> make<00:05:03.720> an<00:05:03.840> a<00:05:05.690> out<00:05:06.690> of<00:05:08.270> my<00:05:09.270> D

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
off I'm going to make an a out of my D
