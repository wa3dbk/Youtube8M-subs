00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.310
 welcome to a new one on tv 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.579
 1 very special 

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:24.380
 thanks all the necessary processes 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.869
 to end once and for all with the alien invasion 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.730
 because we are against and zero 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:33.200
 new York 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.300
 decades ago trip to leave that the law 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.300
 it's you 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.699
 the world is being shaken by all kinds of climatic catastrophes 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:52.979
 our society is on the verge of chaos 

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:55.979
 and the apocalypse I have not done anything but start 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.020
 alien troops are trying to end life on the face of the 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.770
 land 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.630
 for this they are beginning to destroy some of the most important cities 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.690
 of the world 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.210
 we are one of the greatest hopes of our species we are a 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.370
 soldier of elite that has the powerful shows the others 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.910
 a suit with which we can perform all kinds of feats dick a 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.910
 Super Hero 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.030
 to go out game you have to be strong 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.880
 they are the hardest they will endure disburse 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.880
 will be prepared to accept 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.880
 sporting 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.079
 between these there are two really strong elements 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:51.560
 On the one hand we are our suits able to convert we ask a 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.350
 human weapon 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.880
 we are a machine to kill both melee and thanks to all the 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.880
 armament that we will have 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.310
 on the other hand to strong the graphic engine 33 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.810
 thanks to the latest technology of playtech we can see a new york 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.599
 completely destroyed really incredible a graphic environment that 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:14.560
 exceeds everything seen above and that is even more surprising 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.509
 stereoscopic monitors 

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:19.909
 an unprecedented experience that for the first time 2 in the world of 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:22.909
 video game consoles 

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:28.039
 must be done 

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:30.979
 in which not even force 

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:35.319
 in those moments I thought of the interpol so practice three camouflage fronts 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:36.670
 that is 2 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.610
 When the face-to-face fails, the best thing is to be invincible 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:53.299
 in crysis 2 an artificial intelligence has been created that will put us 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:54.789
 the difficult things 

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:57.859
 that is why we will not always have to face face to face with our 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:00.809
 adversaries 

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:02.249
 they are thinking 

00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:04.210
 we will also have to do it 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.360
 to get it we can use the environment to be more deadly 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.409
 if we wish we can use our camouflage skills 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:14.759
 because if there is something for your advice 

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:18.049
 it is a blunt blow that the enemy has not even seen coming 

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:29.759
 if we look at the door of the sun people continue with their idea 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:33.429
 all the ccaa so that we get 

00:03:33.429 --> 00:03:35.669
 the reason is that it is worth 

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:38.669
 the war is not made to pray together close 

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:44.309
 you will win 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:55.959
 both in the new online mode of crysis 2 and its spectacular 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:00.019
 campaign we will have to show that we are the most agile characters in 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:03.019
 all the planet earth to achieve our purposes 

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:11.389
 take advantage of all the elements that the scenario gives you to run the most 

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:14.389
 as fast as you can and take advantage of the surprise factor 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:18.829
 between their two the strongest win but especially in the first to give 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.599
 the blow that yes the enemies are not lame either 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:33.569
 we want to show the palms that we have 

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:37.550
 we have one last 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:38.949
 it acted 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:42.580
 its speed strength the smart one to be able to make through training 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.919
 we wait at home 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:49.020
 as long as we have this stellar event 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.729
 until then 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:51.549
 the drawer
