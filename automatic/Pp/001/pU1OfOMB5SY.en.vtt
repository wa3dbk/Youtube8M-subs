 like a tightrope walker on a wire and to 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.840
 every moment you think you can 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.369
 to fall and every obstacle is a little 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.670
 a deliverance located when he won the 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.650
 two 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.909
 two years ago I was counting 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.220
 really then there was really 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.450
 pressure really pressure let's say 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.189
 that I really crossed my fingers 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.400
 this time I think I'm going to squeeze 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.400
 the buttocks 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.930
 he who is not driven by a weight 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.430
 heavy but by dominique braye under 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.050
 the former jockey who had to leave paris 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.430
 in 2013 to find a second wind 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:52.790
 at Dragey in Mont Saint Bay 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.980
 michel 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.080
 miller thomas looking to ride on a 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.660
 pedestal they deserve yet already 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.190
 this kapgarde son raised by the family 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.410
 Michel and the young thomas leboucher 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.090
 houara of the place of the fields in normandy has 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.860
 won his first race to dieppe before 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.020
 to suddenly show up in the fall 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.860
 2013 in auteuil at 4 years the media 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.980
 find 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.360
 after winning and hemorrhage law and 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.060
 the hague jousselin did not make it a 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.910
 great horse not even a very good horse 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.250
 of which just fall landes of abnormal wants 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.850
 So here it is for me it is the mind that 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.800
 spit 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.930
 nothing disturbs him always had to 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.150
 embarrassment even if internally when he is 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.440
 going on if he's a bit stressed but the 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:36.320
 morning workout walk the economy 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:40.390
 a job is never hard here you go 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.390
 the mind of the cracks 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.020
 when we know that some people 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.420
 have been waiting for this moment all their life and 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.970
 that I am 21 years old 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.700
 it is the horse the horse of the family 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.140
 running on the big steeplechase 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.500
 today is a moment a moment 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.500
 extraordinary 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.599
 they have won everything for a long time and 

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:16.519
 many times putting the jockey 2011 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:19.489
 thomas jacques ricou quadruples whips 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:21.170
 golden maggie brilliant 87 years the lady 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.459
 to the famous red hat of 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.859
 owners in France since 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.879
 70s did not win the big 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:28.340
 steeplechase of paris 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:29.959
 a consecration that also escaped 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.569
 his coach dominique bressot then 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:34.219
 jockey in 2003 and following a 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:36.109
 foot suffered in italy had to look 

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:39.739
 from the grandstands fly away line 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:42.769
 marine with christophe pious and that's 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:44.310
 sure the ovation of the crowd rushes for 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:46.920
 a long trip 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.090
 6 km doubled for bronze 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.620
 only his bet 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.060
 2 while he took the northern head 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.830
 thomas will give the public a huge 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.390
 scare by putting a brake on 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.580
 first pass of the arena the team 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.379
 but he is recovering right away in the 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.629
 rhythm next to shannon rock that has 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:02.310
 close up miller thomas franchissant 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:04.080
 hours the river for the second time 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.450
 then they fly over their wing ditch and 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.720
 fence in front of which beautiful life must 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.720
 stop 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.120
 with 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.000
 I see our customers 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.670
 I do not win 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.009
 2 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:32.749
 he knew 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:35.199
 proud and I believe that one is conceived as 

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:35.199
 one 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:47.230
 and last 150 meters it was to whom 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.260
 I called karl after the last 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:52.570
 and here I am asked if he will leave 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.620
 but hey it's a good horse and you 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.820
 personal title she comforts us 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.020
 with the group it's because he's 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.870
 remained one am here I still had 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:01.570
 that I live between equals and win it with 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:17.470
 his horse there that I made that I 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:19.110
 brought the day to the top level and 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.670
 will have scared the resin is 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.710

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:25.540

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:30.100
 rarely lived tall and afraid you arrived 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:33.910
 at the same time the follower boat goatherd 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:35.680
 sherbrooke i know it's not possible 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:37.510
 but I know that my horse is cracking 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.820
 never said do we go then 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:48.280
 will it start well? 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:49.840
 franÃ§oise to jump it's amazing 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.730
 a dream that becomes reality 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.740
 thirty years that I wait maybe more 

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:55.840
 since my brother george hurst reindeer 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:59.919
 could here he would have deserved to win 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:01.570
 it was a good guy really got scared to 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:03.310
 the river and before it does not 

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:05.919
 did not want very well and I got 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:07.900
 say where we will have to stop because we 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:11.350
 must always protected from horses it was 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:12.850
 the wise option and after the river he has 

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:15.130
 seemed to find the right rhythm 

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:18.970
 he was able to resume his action from 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:21.130
 forward then it's a good finisher 

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:22.750
 and if we saw doubts before costs and 

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:24.930
 to the obvious managers that she wanted in 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:27.490
 to know if we really had to run 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:29.500
 after four decades of maggie efforts 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:29.949

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.020
