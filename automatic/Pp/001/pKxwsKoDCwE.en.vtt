sometimes it is sometimes it it and I'm
not<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.630> of<00:01:33.630> course<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:34.049> can<00:01:34.229> use<00:01:34.409> this

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
not and of course you can use this

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.999 
not and of course you can use this
technique<00:01:34.890> on<00:01:35.720> tanks<00:01:36.720> of<00:01:36.930> any<00:01:38.479> nationality

technique on tanks of any nationality

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.280 
technique on tanks of any nationality
doesn't<00:01:41.009> have<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.369> be<00:01:41.460> Sherman's

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.260 

you<00:01:45.220> could<00:01:45.370> possibly<00:01:45.730> also<00:01:46.090> do<00:01:46.300> this<00:01:46.510> with<00:01:46.720> a

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
you could possibly also do this with a

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.620 
you could possibly also do this with a
triad<00:01:49.270> German<00:01:49.690> 3<00:01:50.200> tone<00:01:50.500> is<00:01:51.430> a<00:01:51.490> 2<00:01:51.760> tone<00:01:51.970> now<00:01:52.390> 3

that<00:02:06.010> would<00:02:06.100> work<00:02:06.310> but<00:02:07.110> it<00:02:08.110> sounds

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
that would work but it sounds

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.310 
that would work but it sounds
interesting<00:02:08.470> I<00:02:08.920> think<00:02:09.220> it<00:02:09.490> would<00:02:09.610> work<00:02:10.320> now

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
interesting I think it would work now

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.590 
interesting I think it would work now

that well ideally you want to use an

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.400 
that well ideally you want to use an
airbrush<00:02:17.920> to<00:02:18.850> paint<00:02:19.060> these<00:02:19.240> but<00:02:19.930> if<00:02:20.080> you<00:02:20.200> don't

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
airbrush to paint these but if you don't

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:21.690 
airbrush to paint these but if you don't
have<00:02:20.560> an<00:02:20.709> airbrush<00:02:21.100> you<00:02:21.280> can<00:02:21.430> use<00:02:21.550> this

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
have an airbrush you can use this

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
so I'm with an airbrush you could paint

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.949 
so I'm with an airbrush you could paint
these<00:02:28.129> by<00:02:28.340> hand<00:02:28.579> if<00:02:28.730> you<00:02:28.760> wanted<00:02:28.849> if<00:02:29.780> you're

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
don't have access that an airbrush would

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.670 
don't have access that an airbrush would
work<00:02:34.579> or<00:02:34.819> possibly<00:02:35.540> even<00:02:35.659> a<00:02:36.049> regular<00:02:36.230> brush

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680

you<00:02:36.980> just<00:02:37.159> have<00:02:37.280> to<00:02:37.370> make<00:02:37.519> sure<00:02:37.640> not<00:02:37.849> to<00:02:38.120> move

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
you just have to make sure not to move

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.140 
you just have to make sure not to move

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:34.379 
because you can reuse this so you can do

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:36.860 
because you can reuse this so you can do

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
using the silly putty technique here I

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.330 
using the silly putty technique here I
should<00:03:40.720> mention<00:03:41.019> that<00:03:41.230> this<00:03:41.470> actually<00:03:42.159> came

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
should mention that this actually came

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:49.559 
should mention that this actually came
from<00:03:42.450> 35<00:03:44.549> 135th<00:03:45.549> scale<00:03:45.849> armor<00:03:46.239> and<00:03:48.329> just<00:03:49.329> as

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:49.569 
from 35 135th scale armor and just as

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:52.649 
from 35 135th scale armor and just as
here<00:03:50.019> it<00:03:50.170> is<00:03:50.319> used<00:03:50.530> to<00:03:50.769> do<00:03:51.310> camouflage<00:03:51.909> schemes

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:52.659 
here it is used to do camouflage schemes

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:55.020 
here it is used to do camouflage schemes
on<00:03:52.930> tanks<00:03:53.379> I<00:03:53.530> wanted<00:03:54.220> to<00:03:54.280> see<00:03:54.459> if<00:03:54.579> it<00:03:54.700> can<00:03:54.879> work

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
on tanks I wanted to see if it can work

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:02.500 
on tanks I wanted to see if it can work
on<00:03:55.269> 15<00:03:55.870> millimeter<00:03:56.319> and<00:03:56.500> I<00:03:56.849> believe<00:03:57.849> it<00:03:57.940> does

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.510 

now<00:04:03.510> here's<00:04:03.750> the<00:04:03.870> tank<00:04:04.080> all<00:04:04.710> the<00:04:05.160> details

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
now here's the tank all the details

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.990 
now here's the tank all the details
painted<00:04:06.440> decals<00:04:07.440> applied<00:04:07.860> and<00:04:08.190> gloss<00:04:08.490> coated

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.870 
painted decals applied and gloss coated
put<00:04:09.990> a<00:04:10.020> lot<00:04:10.230> of<00:04:10.320> stars<00:04:10.590> on<00:04:11.010> the<00:04:11.220> tank<00:04:11.460> because

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
put a lot of stars on the tank because

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.290 
put a lot of stars on the tank because
this<00:04:12.690> camo<00:04:13.020> scheme<00:04:13.380> does<00:04:13.650> look<00:04:13.860> a<00:04:13.890> little

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.300 
this camo scheme does look a little

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.509 
this camo scheme does look a little
German<00:04:15.300> ish<00:04:15.650> so<00:04:16.650> I<00:04:16.709> want<00:04:17.040> to<00:04:17.100> make<00:04:17.190> it<00:04:17.310> clear

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
German ish so I want to make it clear

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.180 
German ish so I want to make it clear
that<00:04:17.760> these<00:04:17.910> are<00:04:17.970> US<00:04:18.390> tanks<00:04:18.840> and<00:04:19.019> you<00:04:19.890> notice

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
that these are US tanks and you notice

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.510 
that these are US tanks and you notice
all<00:04:20.400> the<00:04:20.549> numbers<00:04:20.910> on<00:04:21.180> the<00:04:21.750> hulls<00:04:22.340> there<00:04:23.340> are

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
all the numbers on the hulls there are

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.700 
all the numbers on the hulls there are
corresponding<00:04:23.970> matching<00:04:24.660> numbers<00:04:25.170> on<00:04:25.500> the

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
corresponding matching numbers on the

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.520 
corresponding matching numbers on the
turrets<00:04:26.420> because<00:04:27.420> each<00:04:27.720> tank<00:04:28.290> has<00:04:28.380> a

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
turrets because each tank has a

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.040 
turrets because each tank has a
different<00:04:28.890> camouflage<00:04:29.370> scheme<00:04:29.850> and<00:04:30.120> I<00:04:30.840> wanted

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
different camouflage scheme and I wanted

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.740 
different camouflage scheme and I wanted
to<00:04:31.110> make<00:04:31.290> sure<00:04:31.320> to<00:04:31.710> match<00:04:31.860> the<00:04:31.920> right<00:04:32.280> tanks

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
to make sure to match the right tanks

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.280 
to make sure to match the right tanks
with<00:04:33.750> the<00:04:33.840> right<00:04:33.990> turrets<00:04:35.480> so<00:04:36.480> at<00:04:36.810> this<00:04:37.050> stage

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
with the right turrets so at this stage

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.560 
with the right turrets so at this stage
the<00:04:37.770> only<00:04:37.950> thing<00:04:38.070> left<00:04:38.190> to<00:04:38.280> do<00:04:38.460> is<00:04:38.730> the

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
the only thing left to do is the

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.750 
the only thing left to do is the
