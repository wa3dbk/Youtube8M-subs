00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 we know the track now a food entered 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.830
 fully in the Mediterranean diet 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.990
 a marked and a greedy ria that 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.110
 replaces a meal very well 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.420
 complete therefore as we know the track is 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.730
 prepared with a flour base 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.010
 mixed with water, salt and yeast ed 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.650
 a known quantity of extra virgin olive oil 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.420
 of olive therefore making some calculations 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.609
 in short, we realize that pizza 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.420
 classical is a real source of 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.700
 carbohydrates but how to adapt the pizza 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.649
 to our needs if we are following 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.140
 for example a high-protein diet 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.600
 so rich in proteins is very 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.180
 in short, simple enough to distort it 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.690
 the whole structure of the pizza as is 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.030
 does 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.879
 let's replace the classic water 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.969
 that is used in the mixture with source 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.610
 of proteins such as egg whites then 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.710
 spreadable and fortifying cheese 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.379
 imola protein content with proteins 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.449
 of ultra concentrated milk whey 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.680
 microfiltered we will go to discover them 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:07.680
 together ingredients to prepare the 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.619
 Protein pizza base is needed 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.740
 40 grams of oat bran then fiber 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:17.520
 soluble 40 grams of wheat bran 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.340
 insoluble fiber predominantly then 100 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.590
 g of whole wheat flour 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.830
 then we have all the powerful cheese 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.439
 spreadable 70 g 20 grams of protein 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.360
 of ultra microfiltered whey 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.110
 and concentrate neutral taste clearly 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:37.350
 because we are doing 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:40.079
 the pizza 3 egg whites then 5 grams of salt 5 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.680
 grams of sugar and 3 grams of yeast 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:49.020
 of dried beer for seasoning 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:50.939
 instead I chose 150 g of tuna a 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.780
 natural then source of proteins also 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:58.710
 this 100 grams 150 grams of puree 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:02.240
 of tomato 30 grams of capers under 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:06.299
 salt well knows almost under running water 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.990
 125 g of mozzarella for pizza and oregano 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.990
 enough 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.870
 I forgot a drop of oil 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:15.849
 extra virgin olive oil to oil the 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:19.239
 pot me 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:22.890
 we immediately begin to prepare take 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:26.560
 a nice headline from then we think first 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:30.459
 all dust so bran of 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:37.150
 whole wheat flour and bran 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:39.849
 then add the salt 5 more 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.470
 sugar sugar grams 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:44.139
 important to promote fermentation 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:50.519
 of yeast dry yeast the yeast of 

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:55.750
 dry beer here and now we mix 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:57.939
 to mix everything well then 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.010
 we also add whey proteins 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:01.659
 some milk 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.790
 us at my personal trainer tv mille 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:10.329
 we compare from the production site 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:13.060
 publish supplements ok 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:15.909
 and then add the liquid part then 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:19.750
 egg whites source of proteins 3 egg whites here they are 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:21.900
 here and then we also add the cheese 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.900
 spreadable 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:33.380
 for a nice load of proteins then 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:36.230
 now let's go on to mix well for the 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.840
 all with the wooden ladle 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.720
 it must still be a dough 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.640
 rather soft so you don't have to 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.620
 go and mix it as it is 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.890
 used to do for the classic dough of the 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:52.580
 pizza or bread because then practically 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:54.920
 we're going to spread it on a baking sheet 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:57.489
 then we continue to baking 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.489
 mix 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.860
 we are therefore mixing a little with the 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.630
 hands but how do you see the dough and a lot 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.910
 sticky so you don't have to like it 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:11.600
 in short, I said, making a ball 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.860
 rather dry it is ok now the dough is 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.500
 ready because we never called for 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:18.979
 well the ingredients I've already put a 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:22.729
 some oil in a pan on a baking sheet 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:25.150
 baked and now we go to take the 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:28.100
 base of protein pizza and let's go to 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:30.830
 push it with your hands then turn it 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:35.320
 in short, to facilitate drafting 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:37.700
 of the dough and not to cover completely 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.610
 the pan then also crushed 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:42.950
 with poles just like I'm doing 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:45.229
 then when you have given the right shape 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:48.710
 the perfect shape 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:51.530
 let it rise for about an hour and 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:54.620
 half two, in short, until you see 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:56.000
 that the dough becomes pretty swollen 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:02.289
 then in short we will go to 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.289
 stuff it and tell her here 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:08.360
 after about an hour and a half rest 

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:10.250
 in a warm environment this is a 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.190
 result you see that in short the pizza 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:15.830
 protein has slightly swollen now 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:18.590
 we proceed to the filling with the 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:21.669
 filling then we distribute some 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.669
 tomato puree 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:38.240
 then we add the classic mozzarella 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.240
 I distribute a little better 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:45.090
 we add the classic mozzarella for 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.280
 Pizza 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:48.780
 so I advise you against using the 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.390
 mozzarella fiordilatte not because it is 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:53.520
 because it is not a good favorite but rather 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:55.890
 tends to produce some water in 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:06:01.230
 cooking so do not recommend it because of 

00:05:55.890 --> 00:06:05.870
 for this reason we add some 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:05.870
 capers a bit of quality 

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:17.340
 the center is now a bit of tuna at 

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:22.560
 natural 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:27.620
 also this a little here and a little there and 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:31.200
 now last touch powdered with 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:33.120
 abundant oregano here it is the beautiful one 

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:36.110
 pizza protests therefore ready to be 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:39.890
 informed then hot oven 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:43.430
 preheated to 190 200 degrees for approx 

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:43.430
 15 20 minutes 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:47.010
 I hope my high-protein pizza will 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:49.980
 both liked it 

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:50.790
 a perfect combination of goodness and 

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:52.770
 protein 

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:55.050
 if you were you would go to look around 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:56.669
 in the protein recipes section of Maida 

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:58.980
 among the tv kingdom where you can find 

00:06:56.669 --> 00:07:01.250
 other interesting research they do at 

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:01.250
 your case
