hearing<00:02:09.090> now<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:09.569> again<00:02:10.470> it's<00:02:10.739> atop<00:02:11.100> the

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
hearing now and again it's atop the

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.870 
hearing now and again it's atop the
Panasonic<00:02:12.150> gh3<00:02:12.480> and<00:02:13.260> recording<00:02:13.680> ATC<00:02:14.160> HD<00:02:14.610> and

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
Panasonic gh3 and recording ATC HD and

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.059 
Panasonic gh3 and recording ATC HD and
this<00:02:15.600> is<00:02:15.720> 24<00:02:16.140> frames<00:02:16.290> a<00:02:16.500> second

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
this is 24 frames a second

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.360 
this is 24 frames a second
I<00:02:17.100> believe<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:17.880> bitrate<00:02:18.150> on<00:02:18.510> that<00:02:18.720> is<00:02:18.930> like<00:02:19.370> 24

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
I believe the bitrate on that is like 24

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.970 
I believe the bitrate on that is like 24
Mbps<00:02:20.940> or<00:02:21.120> something<00:02:21.390> nothing<00:02:22.110> very<00:02:22.410> high<00:02:22.680> but

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
Mbps or something nothing very high but

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.280 
Mbps or something nothing very high but
again<00:02:23.190> this<00:02:23.370> is<00:02:23.580> typical<00:02:24.270> for<00:02:24.569> YouTube<00:02:24.959> videos

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
again this is typical for YouTube videos

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.880 
again this is typical for YouTube videos
and<00:02:25.910> just<00:02:26.910> a<00:02:27.090> good<00:02:27.480> good<00:02:28.140> old<00:02:28.260> comparison

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
and just a good good old comparison

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.130 
and just a good good old comparison
between<00:02:29.069> the<00:02:29.340> two<00:02:29.370> microphones<00:02:29.910> to<00:02:30.630> be<00:02:30.750> fair

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
between the two microphones to be fair

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.030 
between the two microphones to be fair
this<00:02:31.980> is<00:02:32.190> a<00:02:32.370> very<00:02:33.000> echoey<00:02:33.420> room<00:02:33.780> I<00:02:34.019> do<00:02:34.290> hear<00:02:34.860> an

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
this is a very echoey room I do hear an

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.309 
this is a very echoey room I do hear an
attic<00:02:35.370> fan<00:02:35.670> that<00:02:36.239> is<00:02:36.390> going<00:02:36.660> with<00:02:36.840> my<00:02:36.959> own<00:02:37.110> ear

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
attic fan that is going with my own ear

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.080 
attic fan that is going with my own ear
and<00:02:37.560> every<00:02:37.830> once<00:02:38.010> in<00:02:38.100> a<00:02:38.190> while<00:02:38.220> a<00:02:38.340> car<00:02:38.489> will<00:02:38.970> go

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
and every once in a while a car will go

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.270 
and every once in a while a car will go
by<00:02:39.269> so<00:02:39.600> the<00:02:39.750> tests<00:02:40.110> might<00:02:40.290> not<00:02:40.470> be<00:02:40.590> exactly<00:02:40.680> the

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
by so the tests might not be exactly the

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.110 
by so the tests might not be exactly the
same<00:02:41.310> as<00:02:41.670> far<00:02:41.880> as<00:02:42.030> constant<00:02:42.959> sound<00:02:43.910> it's<00:02:44.910> not<00:02:45.090> a

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
same as far as constant sound it's not a

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.020 
same as far as constant sound it's not a
super<00:02:45.660> controlled<00:02:46.100> environment<00:02:47.100> but<00:02:47.280> as<00:02:47.850> it

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
super controlled environment but as it

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.300 
super controlled environment but as it
controlled<00:02:48.480> as<00:02:48.600> I<00:02:48.720> can<00:02:48.930> make<00:02:49.140> it<00:02:49.319> so<00:02:50.220> again

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
controlled as I can make it so again

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.250 
controlled as I can make it so again
this<00:02:50.610> room<00:02:50.850> is<00:02:50.970> very<00:02:51.180> echoey<00:02:51.510> hardwood<00:02:52.019> floors

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
this room is very echoey hardwood floors

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.360 
this room is very echoey hardwood floors
and<00:02:53.299> these<00:02:54.299> two<00:02:54.540> mics<00:02:54.750> should<00:02:55.350> be<00:02:55.590> somewhat

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
and these two mics should be somewhat

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.000 
and these two mics should be somewhat
different<00:02:56.790> they<00:02:57.630> are<00:02:57.660> very<00:02:58.079> similar<00:02:58.410> in<00:02:58.709> size

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
different they are very similar in size

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.560 
different they are very similar in size
and<00:02:59.400> look<00:03:00.299> and<00:03:00.570> price<00:03:00.959> so<00:03:02.239> I'm<00:03:03.239> going<00:03:03.420> to<00:03:03.450> go

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
and look and price so I'm going to go

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.600 
and look and price so I'm going to go
ahead<00:03:03.720> and<00:03:03.870> let<00:03:04.049> it<00:03:04.170> be<00:03:04.440> quiet<00:03:04.920> now<00:03:05.190> so<00:03:05.400> you<00:03:05.489> can

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
ahead and let it be quiet now so you can

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:14.100 
ahead and let it be quiet now so you can
hear<00:03:05.850> the<00:03:06.230> sound<00:03:07.230> of<00:03:07.489> quietness

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.170 

okay<00:03:14.920> and<00:03:15.160> the<00:03:15.310> only<00:03:15.430> thing<00:03:15.610> I<00:03:15.670> can<00:03:15.850> hear<00:03:16.000> when

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
okay and the only thing I can hear when

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.200 
okay and the only thing I can hear when
it's<00:03:16.300> quiet<00:03:16.480> is<00:03:16.810> that<00:03:17.400> fan<00:03:18.400> going<00:03:18.790> off<00:03:19.000> in<00:03:19.180> the

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:19.210 
it's quiet is that fan going off in the

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:20.640 
it's quiet is that fan going off in the
Attic<00:03:19.570> so<00:03:19.600> I<00:03:19.780> don't<00:03:20.020> know<00:03:20.080> if<00:03:20.170> these<00:03:20.290> mites<00:03:20.500> are

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
Attic so I don't know if these mites are

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.410 
Attic so I don't know if these mites are
picking<00:03:20.920> it<00:03:21.010> up<00:03:21.100> let<00:03:21.610> me<00:03:21.640> know<00:03:21.730> that<00:03:21.970> in<00:03:22.270> the

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
picking it up let me know that in the

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.290 
picking it up let me know that in the
comments<00:03:22.990> below<00:03:23.050> if<00:03:23.200> you<00:03:23.350> can<00:03:23.470> hear<00:03:23.620> that<00:03:24.300> so

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
comments below if you can hear that so

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:43.729 
comments below if you can hear that so
here<00:03:25.570> is<00:03:25.660> a<00:03:25.690> guitar<00:03:26.200> last<00:03:26.740> test<00:03:27.160> here

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.140 

so<00:03:44.739> let<00:03:45.129> me<00:03:45.190> know<00:03:45.280> in<00:03:45.400> the<00:03:45.489> comments<00:03:45.879> below<00:03:45.970> if

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
so let me know in the comments below if

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.660 
so let me know in the comments below if
you<00:03:46.629> liked<00:03:47.140> one<00:03:47.470> versus<00:03:48.010> the<00:03:48.159> other<00:03:48.190> if<00:03:48.549> you

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
you liked one versus the other if you

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.190 
you liked one versus the other if you
heard<00:03:48.879> a<00:03:48.970> difference<00:03:49.330> if<00:03:49.540> you<00:03:49.659> think<00:03:49.900> that<00:03:50.080> the

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
heard a difference if you think that the

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.809 
heard a difference if you think that the
difference<00:03:50.500> is<00:03:50.620> so<00:03:50.769> negligible<00:03:51.400> that<00:03:51.730> it

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
difference is so negligible that it

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:53.309 
difference is so negligible that it
really<00:03:52.060> doesn't<00:03:52.450> matter<00:03:52.540> just<00:03:52.720> go<00:03:53.049> for<00:03:53.230> the

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:53.319 
really doesn't matter just go for the

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:56.009 
really doesn't matter just go for the
cheapest<00:03:53.739> mic<00:03:54.239> let<00:03:55.239> me<00:03:55.299> know<00:03:55.420> I<00:03:55.660> want<00:03:55.900> to<00:03:55.930> know

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
cheapest mic let me know I want to know

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:58.050 
cheapest mic let me know I want to know
what<00:03:56.110> you<00:03:56.200> guys<00:03:56.349> think<00:03:56.830> both<00:03:57.549> of<00:03:57.700> these<00:03:57.790> mics

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
what you guys think both of these mics

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.180 
what you guys think both of these mics
are<00:03:58.330> priced<00:03:58.660> fairly<00:03:58.959> similarly<00:03:59.680> I<00:03:59.709> think<00:03:59.830> the

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
are priced fairly similarly I think the

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.130 
are priced fairly similarly I think the
rode<00:04:00.430> videomic<00:04:00.790> pro<00:04:00.940> costs<00:04:01.750> a<00:04:01.810> little<00:04:02.019> bit

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
rode videomic pro costs a little bit

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.819 
rode videomic pro costs a little bit
more<00:04:02.580> but<00:04:03.580> I<00:04:03.790> just<00:04:04.150> picked<00:04:04.390> up<00:04:04.510> a<00:04:04.660> shure<00:04:04.930> vpat<00:04:05.500> 3

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:05.829 
more but I just picked up a shure vpat 3

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:07.199 
more but I just picked up a shure vpat 3
and<00:04:05.980> i<00:04:06.040> was<00:04:06.129> very<00:04:06.370> curious<00:04:06.640> to<00:04:06.790> see<00:04:06.910> how<00:04:07.090> this

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
and i was very curious to see how this

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.390 
and i was very curious to see how this
performs<00:04:07.750> the<00:04:08.079> build<00:04:08.379> quality<00:04:08.680> of<00:04:08.920> these<00:04:09.129> 2

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
performs the build quality of these 2

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.270 
performs the build quality of these 2
mics<00:04:09.640> is<00:04:09.909> fairly<00:04:10.569> different<00:04:11.010> the<00:04:12.010> rode

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
mics is fairly different the rode

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.039 
mics is fairly different the rode
videomic<00:04:12.640> pro<00:04:12.790> is<00:04:13.239> made<00:04:13.420> out<00:04:13.569> of<00:04:13.599> plastic

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:14.049 
videomic pro is made out of plastic

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:16.590 
videomic pro is made out of plastic
material<00:04:14.890> with<00:04:15.190> a<00:04:15.220> shock<00:04:15.730> mount<00:04:15.970> and<00:04:16.269> it<00:04:16.479> also

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
material with a shock mount and it also

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.750 
material with a shock mount and it also
takes<00:04:16.959> a<00:04:17.109> 9-volt<00:04:17.530> battery<00:04:17.889> and<00:04:18.130> I<00:04:18.340> will<00:04:18.549> say

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
takes a 9-volt battery and I will say

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.370 
takes a 9-volt battery and I will say
