take<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.080> look<00:00:28.320> at<00:00:28.529> another<00:00:28.890> snare<00:00:29.460> drum<00:00:29.730> a

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
take a look at another snare drum a

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.540 
take a look at another snare drum a
couple<00:00:30.539> of<00:00:30.599> weeks<00:00:30.750> ago<00:00:30.900> we<00:00:31.199> looked<00:00:31.410> at<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:31.949> very

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
couple of weeks ago we looked at a very

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.959 
couple of weeks ago we looked at a very
artificial<00:00:33.149> sort<00:00:34.020> of<00:00:34.110> vintage<00:00:34.350> sounding<00:00:35.070> drum

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
artificial sort of vintage sounding drum

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.639 
artificial sort of vintage sounding drum
machine<00:00:36.239> snare<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:36.809> this<00:00:37.230> week<00:00:37.410> we're<00:00:37.530> going

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
machine snare and this week we're going

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.319 
machine snare and this week we're going
to<00:00:37.739> take<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:37.950> look<00:00:38.160> at<00:00:38.250> something<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.820> little<00:00:39.180> bit

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
to take a look at something a little bit

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.180 
to take a look at something a little bit
more<00:00:39.360> realistic<00:00:40.110> that<00:00:40.230> uses<00:00:40.680> velocity

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
more realistic that uses velocity

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.190 
more realistic that uses velocity
dynamics<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:42.120> create<00:00:42.570> something<00:00:42.780> that's<00:00:43.079> a

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
dynamics to create something that's a

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.319 
dynamics to create something that's a
little<00:00:43.320> bit<00:00:43.469> more<00:00:43.860> dynamic<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.940> playable

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
little bit more dynamic and playable

00:00:45.329 --> 00:01:00.760 
little bit more dynamic and playable
let's<00:00:45.780> take<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:45.989> listen<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.500> preset

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:11.000 

and<00:01:01.770> let's<00:01:01.920> take<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.130> listen<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.640> snare<00:01:10.010> you

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
and let's take a listen to the snare you

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.950 
and let's take a listen to the snare you
can<00:01:11.160> hear<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.610> snare<00:01:11.850> varies<00:01:12.360> when<00:01:12.690> the

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
can hear that the snare varies when the

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.350 
can hear that the snare varies when the
velocity<00:01:13.530> varies<00:01:13.920> in<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.400> pattern<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:14.910> this

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
velocity varies in the pattern and this

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.880 
velocity varies in the pattern and this
is<00:01:15.480> part<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:15.870> the<00:01:15.990> advantage<00:01:16.410> of<00:01:16.530> having<00:01:16.620> a

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
is part of the advantage of having a

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.740 
is part of the advantage of having a
drums<00:01:17.160> synthesizer<00:01:17.400> over<00:01:18.120> just<00:01:18.300> playing<00:01:18.540> back

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
drums synthesizer over just playing back

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.240 
drums synthesizer over just playing back
straight<00:01:19.110> samples<00:01:19.590> because<00:01:19.950> you<00:01:20.070> can

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
straight samples because you can

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.030 
straight samples because you can
actually<00:01:20.400> tailor<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.480> synthesizer<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.470> alter

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
actually tailor the synthesizer to alter

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.800 
actually tailor the synthesizer to alter
the<00:01:23.160> sound<00:01:23.460> however<00:01:23.730> you<00:01:23.970> want<00:01:24.240> really

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
the sound however you want really

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.600 
the sound however you want really
whereas<00:01:25.350> with<00:01:25.500> samples<00:01:25.950> you're<00:01:26.160> stuck<00:01:26.400> with<00:01:26.550> a

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
whereas with samples you're stuck with a

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.270 
whereas with samples you're stuck with a
very<00:01:26.820> static<00:01:27.390> sound<00:01:27.780> so<00:01:28.620> I'm<00:01:28.710> going<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:28.980> reset

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
very static sound so I'm going to reset

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.830 
very static sound so I'm going to reset
this<00:01:29.400> sound<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:29.790> we'll<00:01:29.910> program<00:01:30.300> it<00:01:30.450> again

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
this sound and we'll program it again

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.640 
this sound and we'll program it again
from<00:01:31.080> scratch<00:01:32.030> I'm<00:01:33.030> just<00:01:33.270> going<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.540> move<00:01:33.960> the

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
from scratch I'm just going to move the

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.980 
from scratch I'm just going to move the
pattern<00:01:35.220> here<00:01:35.610> because<00:01:35.910> when<00:01:36.060> I<00:01:36.090> reset<00:01:36.630> it's

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
pattern here because when I reset it's

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.620 
pattern here because when I reset it's
going<00:01:37.440> to<00:01:37.590> delete<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:40.040> and<00:01:41.360> then<00:01:42.360> I'll<00:01:42.479> move

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
going to delete that and then I'll move

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:50.990 
going to delete that and then I'll move
it<00:01:42.780> straight<00:01:42.900> back<00:01:48.950> and<00:01:49.950> we<00:01:50.520> can<00:01:50.670> hear<00:01:50.850> there

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
it straight back and we can hear there

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.640 
it straight back and we can hear there
the<00:01:51.150> snare<00:01:51.360> has<00:01:51.420> been<00:01:51.720> replaced<00:01:52.260> by<00:01:52.590> the

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 
the snare has been replaced by the

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.370 
the snare has been replaced by the
default<00:01:53.369> tremor<00:01:53.700> sound<00:01:54.060> so<00:01:54.900> the<00:01:55.020> first<00:01:55.229> thing

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
default tremor sound so the first thing

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.990 
default tremor sound so the first thing
I'm<00:01:55.500> going<00:01:55.650> to<00:01:55.740> do<00:01:55.890> ours<00:01:56.070> always<00:01:56.220> is<00:01:56.580> set<00:01:56.850> up

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
I'm going to do ours always is set up

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.990 
I'm going to do ours always is set up
the<00:01:57.150> amplitude<00:01:57.720> envelope<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:58.530> be<00:01:58.619> correct<00:01:59.000> now

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
the amplitude envelope to be correct now

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.820 
the amplitude envelope to be correct now
it's<00:02:00.150> a<00:02:00.210> very<00:02:00.240> short<00:02:00.450> punchy<00:02:01.200> snare<00:02:01.470> so<00:02:01.680> we

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
it's a very short punchy snare so we

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.859 
it's a very short punchy snare so we
want<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.070> very<00:02:02.250> short<00:02:02.520> decay<00:02:02.880> less<00:02:03.630> than<00:02:03.810> a

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
want a very short decay less than a

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.350 
want a very short decay less than a
second<00:02:04.260> and<00:02:04.470> then<00:02:05.430> we'll<00:02:05.550> do<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.670> little<00:02:05.760> setup

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
second and then we'll do a little setup

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.690 
second and then we'll do a little setup
on<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.840> oscillator<00:02:07.070> I'm<00:02:08.070> going<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:08.310> tune<00:02:08.550> it

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
on the oscillator I'm going to tune it

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.979 
on the oscillator I'm going to tune it
to<00:02:08.940> somewhere<00:02:09.899> around<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:10.200> D<00:02:10.380> sharp<00:02:10.800> 2<00:02:11.600> and<00:02:12.600> I'm

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
to somewhere around a D sharp 2 and I'm

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.570 
to somewhere around a D sharp 2 and I'm
going<00:02:13.140> to<00:02:13.200> change<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.800> wave<00:02:14.040> shape<00:02:14.340> to<00:02:14.550> a

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
going to change the wave shape to a

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.740 
going to change the wave shape to a
triangle<00:02:16.459> I'm<00:02:17.459> going<00:02:17.610> to<00:02:17.670> pull<00:02:17.910> down<00:02:18.209> the<00:02:18.540> role

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
triangle I'm going to pull down the role

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.360 
triangle I'm going to pull down the role
parameter<00:02:19.350> in<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.800> harmonics<00:02:20.400> section<00:02:22.370> so

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
parameter in the harmonics section so

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.470 
parameter in the harmonics section so
that<00:02:23.519> we're<00:02:23.640> not<00:02:23.670> hearing<00:02:24.060> all<00:02:24.269> those

that we're not hearing all those

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.570 
that we're not hearing all those
harmonics<00:02:25.110> maybe<00:02:25.739> not<00:02:25.890> all<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.070> way<00:02:26.280> we<00:02:26.430> can

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
harmonics maybe not all the way we can

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:33.920 
harmonics maybe not all the way we can
leave<00:02:26.730> in<00:02:26.880> just<00:02:27.030> a<00:02:27.209> little<00:02:27.239> bit<00:02:32.480> so<00:02:33.480> that<00:02:33.510> gives

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
leave in just a little bit so that gives

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.930 
leave in just a little bit so that gives
us<00:02:34.110> the<00:02:34.650> kind<00:02:34.860> of<00:02:34.920> tone<00:02:35.190> and<00:02:35.430> body<00:02:35.550> of<00:02:35.700> the

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
us the kind of tone and body of the

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.840 
us the kind of tone and body of the
snare<00:02:36.560> but<00:02:37.560> we'll<00:02:37.680> also<00:02:37.800> need<00:02:38.130> some<00:02:38.310> noise<00:02:38.550> in

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
snare but we'll also need some noise in

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.210 
snare but we'll also need some noise in
there<00:02:39.060> I'm<00:02:39.570> going<00:02:39.780> to<00:02:39.840> pull<00:02:40.050> down<00:02:40.080> the<00:02:40.769> level

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
there I'm going to pull down the level

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.680 
there I'm going to pull down the level
of<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.400> oscillator<00:02:41.820> in<00:02:42.060> the<00:02:42.150> mixer<00:02:42.540> because

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
of the oscillator in the mixer because

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.320 
of the oscillator in the mixer because
later<00:02:43.380> on<00:02:43.680> we'll<00:02:44.130> be<00:02:44.220> using<00:02:44.370> an<00:02:44.580> envelope<00:02:44.940> to

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
later on we'll be using an envelope to

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.060 
later on we'll be using an envelope to
increase<00:02:45.870> that<00:02:46.080> just<00:02:46.380> for<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:46.560> attack

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
increase that just for the attack

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.020 
increase that just for the attack

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
portion of the snare I'm going to be

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.530

using quite a lot of pre-filter drive on
this<00:02:54.690> patch<00:02:56.120> so<00:02:57.120> I'm<00:02:57.239> going<00:02:57.390> to<00:02:57.420> give<00:02:57.600> it<00:02:57.720> sort

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
this patch so I'm going to give it sort

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.009 
this patch so I'm going to give it sort

the<00:03:01.769> filter<00:03:02.130> I'm<00:03:02.340> going<00:03:02.519> to<00:03:02.580> put<00:03:02.730> in<00:03:02.820> fat<00:03:03.090> mode

the filter I'm going to put in fat mode
and<00:03:03.660> I'm<00:03:03.810> going<00:03:04.019> to<00:03:04.080> choose<00:03:04.500> a<00:03:05.750> two-pole<00:03:06.750> peak

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
and I'm going to choose a two-pole peak

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.470 
and I'm going to choose a two-pole peak
which<00:03:07.769> allows<00:03:08.100> me<00:03:08.310> to<00:03:08.430> just<00:03:08.609> boost<00:03:08.850> certain

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
which allows me to just boost certain

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.390 
which allows me to just boost certain
frequencies<00:03:10.350> and<00:03:10.680> I'm<00:03:10.950> going<00:03:11.100> to<00:03:11.130> put<00:03:11.340> the

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
frequencies and I'm going to put the

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.790 
frequencies and I'm going to put the
cutoff<00:03:11.670> for<00:03:12.120> now

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
cutoff for now

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:19.180 
cutoff for now
down<00:03:12.920> to<00:03:13.130> about<00:03:13.370> 60<00:03:14.060> Hertz<00:03:15.820> 70<00:03:16.820> Hertz<00:03:16.940> a<00:03:18.190> little

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
down to about 60 Hertz 70 Hertz a little

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.190 
down to about 60 Hertz 70 Hertz a little
bit<00:03:19.310> of<00:03:19.400> resonance<00:03:19.820> to<00:03:20.540> increase<00:03:20.840> the<00:03:21.020> peak

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
bit of resonance to increase the peak

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:35.980 
bit of resonance to increase the peak
amount<00:03:34.120> so<00:03:35.120> it's<00:03:35.240> starting<00:03:35.600> to<00:03:35.690> sound<00:03:35.780> like<00:03:35.900> a

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:35.990 
amount so it's starting to sound like a

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.020 
amount so it's starting to sound like a
snare<00:03:36.260> already<00:03:36.620> we'll<00:03:37.400> just<00:03:37.610> tune<00:03:37.850> up<00:03:38.000> the

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
snare already we'll just tune up the

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.540 
snare already we'll just tune up the
noise<00:03:38.270> a<00:03:38.300> little<00:03:38.690> bit<00:03:38.840> I<00:03:39.190> want<00:03:40.190> it<00:03:40.310> to<00:03:40.430> be

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 
noise a little bit I want it to be

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:50.530 
noise a little bit I want it to be
slightly<00:03:40.850> brighter<00:03:48.820> so<00:03:49.820> I've<00:03:50.060> just<00:03:50.090> put<00:03:50.420> the

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
slightly brighter so I've just put the

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.050 
slightly brighter so I've just put the
tone<00:03:50.780> up<00:03:51.020> there<00:03:51.380> and<00:03:51.620> reduced<00:03:52.550> the<00:03:52.700> stereo

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
tone up there and reduced the stereo

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.450 
tone up there and reduced the stereo
with<00:03:53.300> slightly<00:03:53.780> so<00:03:54.140> it's<00:03:54.290> not<00:03:54.470> a<00:03:54.800> huge<00:03:55.070> wide

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:55.460 
with slightly so it's not a huge wide

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.850 
with slightly so it's not a huge wide
snare<00:03:55.970> and<00:03:56.600> what<00:03:56.750> we'll<00:03:56.870> do<00:03:56.990> now<00:03:57.140> is<00:03:57.170> we'll<00:03:57.560> use

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
snare and what we'll do now is we'll use

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.190 
snare and what we'll do now is we'll use
one<00:03:58.580> of<00:03:58.670> the<00:03:58.760> envelopes<00:03:59.180> the<00:03:59.420> fast<00:03:59.720> envelope

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
one of the envelopes the fast envelope

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.090 
one of the envelopes the fast envelope
here<00:04:01.540> to<00:04:02.540> modulate<00:04:02.930> a<00:04:02.990> few<00:04:03.230> things<00:04:03.500> now<00:04:03.800> I<00:04:03.830> want

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
here to modulate a few things now I want

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
here to modulate a few things now I want
this<00:04:04.580> to<00:04:04.820> be<00:04:04.850> a<00:04:05.000> very<00:04:05.660> fast<00:04:06.250> decay<00:04:07.250> and<00:04:08.030> we're

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
this to be a very fast decay and we're

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.270 
this to be a very fast decay and we're
going<00:04:08.240> to<00:04:08.300> use<00:04:08.450> this<00:04:08.630> to<00:04:08.930> create<00:04:09.500> a<00:04:09.770> really

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
going to use this to create a really

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.600 
going to use this to create a really
sharp<00:04:10.550> attack<00:04:11.110> we<00:04:12.110> use<00:04:12.350> it<00:04:12.500> to<00:04:12.770> just<00:04:13.280> increase

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
sharp attack we use it to just increase

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.539 
sharp attack we use it to just increase
the<00:04:13.760> pitch<00:04:14.030> a<00:04:14.420> little<00:04:14.720> bit<00:04:14.870> but<00:04:15.830> mostly<00:04:16.220> to

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
the pitch a little bit but mostly to

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:18.520 
the pitch a little bit but mostly to
increase<00:04:17.419> this<00:04:17.600> gain<00:04:17.870> amount<00:04:18.260> and<00:04:18.440> we're

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
increase this gain amount and we're

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.220 
increase this gain amount and we're
using<00:04:18.709> large<00:04:19.310> amounts<00:04:19.760> of<00:04:19.910> pre<00:04:20.630> filter<00:04:20.989> gain

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.730 
using large amounts of pre filter gain
here<00:04:21.620> I<00:04:22.480> might<00:04:23.480> even<00:04:23.720> add<00:04:23.930> some<00:04:23.960> on<00:04:24.290> the<00:04:24.410> filter

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
here I might even add some on the filter

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.850 
here I might even add some on the filter

three<00:04:30.200> filter<00:04:30.620> gains<00:04:30.860> here<00:04:31.280> there's<00:04:31.520> pre

three filter gains here there's pre
filter<00:04:32.060> gain<00:04:32.360> there's<00:04:33.020> a<00:04:33.140> gain<00:04:33.320> on<00:04:33.500> the<00:04:33.620> filter

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:33.890 
filter gain there's a gain on the filter

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:35.200 
filter gain there's a gain on the filter
itself<00:04:34.040> which<00:04:34.490> gives<00:04:34.520> a<00:04:34.790> slightly<00:04:35.030> different

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
itself which gives a slightly different

character<00:04:35.960> to<00:04:36.110> this<00:04:36.260> one<00:04:36.530> and<00:04:36.770> then<00:04:37.220> there's<00:04:37.400> a

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
character to this one and then there's a

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:38.890 
character to this one and then there's a

post filter gain which I'm actually

incredibly useful for shaping the attack
portion<00:04:44.419> particularly<00:04:45.050> of<00:04:45.370> certain<00:04:46.370> sounds

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
portion particularly of certain sounds

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.180 
portion particularly of certain sounds
and<00:04:46.970> this<00:04:47.060> snare<00:04:47.360> is<00:04:47.540> a<00:04:47.570> very<00:04:47.780> good<00:04:47.930> example

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
and this snare is a very good example

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.250 
and this snare is a very good example
I'm<00:04:49.190> going<00:04:49.400> to<00:04:49.520> use<00:04:49.700> a<00:04:50.120> second<00:04:50.630> envelope<00:04:50.810> the

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260 
I'm going to use a second envelope the

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:52.780 
I'm going to use a second envelope the
slow<00:04:51.650> envelope<00:04:52.100> although<00:04:52.520> I'm<00:04:52.640> actually

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790 
slow envelope although I'm actually

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:58.300 
slow envelope although I'm actually
going<00:04:53.060> to<00:04:53.150> put<00:04:53.270> it<00:04:53.360> to<00:04:53.510> quite<00:04:54.080> a<00:04:54.110> fast<00:04:54.730> time<00:04:57.310> put

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
going to put it to quite a fast time put

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.100 
going to put it to quite a fast time put
a<00:04:58.340> bit<00:04:58.490> of<00:04:58.550> a<00:04:58.640> curve<00:04:58.850> on<00:04:59.060> it<00:04:59.180> and<00:04:59.300> this<00:04:59.690> one<00:04:59.870> I'm

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
a bit of a curve on it and this one I'm

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.590 
a bit of a curve on it and this one I'm
going<00:05:00.290> to<00:05:00.350> use<00:05:00.560> to<00:05:00.860> bring<00:05:01.280> up<00:05:01.430> the<00:05:01.669> volume<00:05:02.450> of

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
going to use to bring up the volume of

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.990 
going to use to bring up the volume of
the<00:05:02.720> oscillator<00:05:03.140> in<00:05:03.530> the<00:05:04.070> attack<00:05:04.340> portion<00:05:04.790> and

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
the oscillator in the attack portion and

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.430 
the oscillator in the attack portion and
I'm<00:05:05.390> actually<00:05:05.540> going<00:05:05.780> to<00:05:05.870> use<00:05:05.990> it<00:05:06.140> to<00:05:06.260> bring

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 
I'm actually going to use it to bring

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.120 
I'm actually going to use it to bring
down<00:05:06.830> the<00:05:07.280> level<00:05:07.310> of<00:05:07.760> the<00:05:08.180> noise<00:05:08.890> so<00:05:09.890> the<00:05:10.010> noise

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
down the level of the noise so the noise

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.370 
down the level of the noise so the noise
actually<00:05:10.610> will<00:05:11.090> be<00:05:11.210> less<00:05:11.570> prevalent<00:05:12.080> in<00:05:12.230> the

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
actually will be less prevalent in the

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:20.490 
actually will be less prevalent in the
attack<00:05:12.650> portion<00:05:13.070> of<00:05:13.160> the<00:05:13.250> snare

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.050 

lastly<00:05:21.500> let's<00:05:21.770> get<00:05:21.950> our<00:05:22.070> velocity<00:05:22.640> modulation

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
lastly let's get our velocity modulation

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.750 
lastly let's get our velocity modulation
going<00:05:23.510> this<00:05:23.960> I'm<00:05:24.230> going<00:05:24.440> to<00:05:24.560> use<00:05:24.800> largely<00:05:25.460> for

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:25.760 
going this I'm going to use largely for

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.520 
going this I'm going to use largely for
the<00:05:25.820> obvious<00:05:26.150> which<00:05:26.360> is<00:05:26.390> to<00:05:26.810> increase<00:05:27.290> the

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
the obvious which is to increase the

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.650 
the obvious which is to increase the
overall<00:05:27.650> volume<00:05:28.070> of<00:05:28.430> the<00:05:28.760> whole<00:05:28.910> thing<00:05:29.150> but

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:29.660 
overall volume of the whole thing but

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.570 
overall volume of the whole thing but
we're<00:05:29.780> also<00:05:29.900> going<00:05:30.230> to<00:05:30.320> use<00:05:30.500> velocity<00:05:31.040> just<00:05:31.310> to

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 
we're also going to use velocity just to

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.580 
we're also going to use velocity just to
adjust<00:05:31.910> a<00:05:32.330> few<00:05:32.510> other<00:05:32.630> parameters<00:05:33.170> maybe<00:05:33.440> a

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
adjust a few other parameters maybe a

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:35.740 
adjust a few other parameters maybe a
little<00:05:33.770> bit<00:05:34.010> of<00:05:34.160> the<00:05:34.400> frequency<00:05:34.910> cutoff<00:05:35.330> of

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:35.750 
little bit of the frequency cutoff of

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:39.010 
little bit of the frequency cutoff of
the<00:05:35.870> filter<00:05:36.350> and<00:05:37.240> definitely<00:05:38.240> of<00:05:38.510> the<00:05:38.540> decay

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.020 
the filter and definitely of the decay

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.710 
the filter and definitely of the decay
parameter<00:05:39.710> of<00:05:39.920> the<00:05:40.250> amplitude<00:05:40.910> envelope<00:05:41.150> so

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:41.720 
parameter of the amplitude envelope so

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.570 
parameter of the amplitude envelope so
they're<00:05:41.900> harder<00:05:42.260> the<00:05:42.380> snare<00:05:42.650> is<00:05:42.830> hit<00:05:43.070> the

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
they're harder the snare is hit the

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.270 
they're harder the snare is hit the
longer<00:05:43.940> it<00:05:44.030> rings<00:05:44.240> for<00:05:44.620> finally<00:05:45.620> I<00:05:45.800> might<00:05:46.070> use

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280 
longer it rings for finally I might use

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.180 
longer it rings for finally I might use
it<00:05:46.490> just<00:05:46.790> to<00:05:46.970> adjust<00:05:47.780> the<00:05:47.930> pitch<00:05:48.230> slightly<00:05:48.980> not

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.190 
it just to adjust the pitch slightly not

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.500 
it just to adjust the pitch slightly not
very<00:05:49.370> much<00:05:49.580> which<00:05:49.790> is<00:05:49.820> why<00:05:49.940> I'm<00:05:50.150> using<00:05:50.180> the

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:50.510 
very much which is why I'm using the

00:05:50.510 --> 00:06:00.460 
very much which is why I'm using the
fine<00:05:50.720> pitch<00:05:51.020> of<00:05:51.650> the<00:05:52.310> oscillator<00:05:59.470> that's

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:00.470 
fine pitch of the oscillator that's

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:08.590 
fine pitch of the oscillator that's
sounding<00:06:00.770> pretty<00:06:00.920> good<00:06:07.300> just<00:06:08.300> bring<00:06:08.510> the

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:08.600 
sounding pretty good just bring the

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:41.500 
sounding pretty good just bring the
level<00:06:08.840> down<00:06:09.020> so<00:06:09.260> it<00:06:09.320> doesn't<00:06:09.380> peak<00:06:40.330> I'm<00:06:41.330> just

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:41.510 
level down so it doesn't peak I'm just

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:43.120 
level down so it doesn't peak I'm just
going<00:06:41.630> to<00:06:41.660> make<00:06:41.780> one<00:06:42.020> small<00:06:42.230> adjustment<00:06:42.560> there

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:43.130 
going to make one small adjustment there

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:46.060 
going to make one small adjustment there
and<00:06:43.370> that<00:06:43.550> is<00:06:43.700> the<00:06:44.690> sort<00:06:44.930> of<00:06:44.990> tonal<00:06:45.710> element

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:46.070 
and that is the sort of tonal element

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:47.980 
and that is the sort of tonal element
the<00:06:46.190> oscillator<00:06:46.640> element<00:06:47.150> of<00:06:47.300> the<00:06:47.419> snare<00:06:47.660> is

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:47.990 
the oscillator element of the snare is

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:50.650 
the oscillator element of the snare is
just<00:06:48.890> feels<00:06:49.070> a<00:06:49.190> bit<00:06:49.220> too<00:06:49.400> static<00:06:50.150> so<00:06:50.330> I'm<00:06:50.450> going

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:50.660 
just feels a bit too static so I'm going

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:52.630 
just feels a bit too static so I'm going
to<00:06:50.720> use<00:06:50.840> the<00:06:50.990> frequency<00:06:51.200> modulation<00:06:51.680> here<00:06:52.430> and

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:52.640 
to use the frequency modulation here and

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.020 
to use the frequency modulation here and
by<00:06:53.570> default<00:06:53.900> that<00:06:54.140> comes<00:06:54.410> from<00:06:54.680> LFO<00:06:55.190> one<00:06:55.520> so

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:56.030 
by default that comes from LFO one so

00:06:56.030 --> 00:07:00.250 
by default that comes from LFO one so
I'm<00:06:56.510> going<00:06:56.660> to<00:06:56.780> switch<00:06:57.050> off<00:06:57.260> the<00:06:58.150> master<00:06:59.260> tempo

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:00.260 
I'm going to switch off the master tempo

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.470 
I'm going to switch off the master tempo
sync<00:07:00.530> of<00:07:00.680> LFO<00:07:01.010> one<00:07:01.310> I'm<00:07:01.580> going<00:07:01.790> to<00:07:01.850> dial<00:07:02.210> in<00:07:02.390> a

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:02.480 
sync of LFO one I'm going to dial in a

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.320 
sync of LFO one I'm going to dial in a
rate<00:07:02.690> of<00:07:03.430> somewhere<00:07:04.430> around<00:07:04.490> a<00:07:04.730> hundred<00:07:04.760> Hertz

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:05.330 
rate of somewhere around a hundred Hertz

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:07.330 
rate of somewhere around a hundred Hertz
and<00:07:06.020> I'm<00:07:06.169> just<00:07:06.380> going<00:07:06.530> to<00:07:06.560> put<00:07:06.800> a<00:07:06.980> small<00:07:07.280> amount

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:07.340 
and I'm just going to put a small amount

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:10.180 
and I'm just going to put a small amount
of<00:07:07.850> frequency<00:07:08.090> modulation<00:07:08.540> in<00:07:09.110> there<00:07:09.350> not<00:07:10.160> a

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:10.190 
of frequency modulation in there not a

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:11.710 
of frequency modulation in there not a
huge<00:07:10.610> amount<00:07:10.730> because<00:07:11.030> that'll<00:07:11.330> affect<00:07:11.419> the

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:11.720 
huge amount because that'll affect the

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:21.690 
huge amount because that'll affect the
tone<00:07:11.930> too<00:07:12.200> much

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:21.700 

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.040 

and<00:07:22.700> it's<00:07:22.880> just<00:07:23.090> helped<00:07:23.360> to<00:07:23.420> break<00:07:23.750> up<00:07:23.930> the

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:24.050 
and it's just helped to break up the

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:34.450 
and it's just helped to break up the
tone<00:07:31.030> a<00:07:32.030> solid<00:07:32.570> snare<00:07:33.100> join<00:07:34.100> me<00:07:34.220> soon<00:07:34.430> for

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:34.460 
tone a solid snare join me soon for

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:37.570 
tone a solid snare join me soon for
another<00:07:34.700> drum<00:07:35.030> synthesis
