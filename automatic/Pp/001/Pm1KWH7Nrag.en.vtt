Hey guys, Chef Kendra here and today we’re
making the English classic fish and chips.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.620
I like to have them with Malt Vinegar.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.240
I was first introduced to Malt vinegar in
a Winsor Ontario race track when I was a little

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.920
kid served and alongside a big paper platter
of French fries.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.700
But that’s another story for another time.
Tatar sauce and hot sauce is also fine choices.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.130
Now I done a video on making French fries
and go watch it right here to watch it.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.730
Now I’m pouring about 2 inches of oil in
this pot. This is another time that I deviate

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:39.440
from a giant vat of oil. It’s just not necessary
and it’s a complete waste of oil, and oil

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.219
is not cheap SON, well not the good stuff
at least.

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:45.030
And I'm going to give them their first fry at about

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.309
300 degrees, remove them to some paper towl
to drain, etc, etc.

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.870
That’s all explained in the French fry video.
However, in this case I’m going to fry them

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.899
once for few minutes, remove them and finish
off right after our wonderful fish is done.

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:01.739
Haddock, and cod
are traditionally used for fish and chips.

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.310
But I’ve found that tilapia is an inexpensive choice,
at least where I live. I’m cutting a couple

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.250
of fillets into about six pieces.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.570
Trivia Time!

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.890
What year was the first Fish and Chips Shop
opened in London, England?

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.299
a. 1860
b. 1778

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.570
c. 1901

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.770
Leave your answer in the comments below!

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.020
I’m going to prepare our batter likes a
BOSS. We’ve got our fish, and I’m going

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.380
to season it in a second.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.299
We’ve got some flour here and this is going
to help our batter stick to the fish. We have

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:46.390
some beer, and a little milk. In the big bowl
is some flour. We have some salt and a little

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:47.460
cayenne pepper.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:59.119
We’re going to get this beer into our bowl,
just like so. Now the milk goes in. Now I’m

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:00.920
just going to whisk this up guys.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:08.490
No brain surgery involved. Once it’s mix
I’m going to set it aside and season the

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:22.510
first with some salt, and the cayenne pepper.
I’m going to mix the seasoning in with my

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:23.260
hands.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:29.379
Remember the oil we blanched our fries in?
I’m going to preheat that same oil to 350

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:31.220
degrees Fahrenheit.

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:42.849
Our trusty fry station is in full effect.
Our fish gets dipped in a thin coat of flour.

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:47.180
Now I’m dipping it in the batter. The thing
I want to make sure of that I let some of

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.659
the excess batter drip off.

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:57.269
Now we gently lower the fish pieces into the
oil, laying them away from us so we don’t

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:02.090
splatter ourselves with hot oil. Don’t just
drop them do it gently and slowly so they

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.530
begin to cook before they hit the bottom.

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.909
Having the correct temperature when you start
and gently lowering them in prevents sticking

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:11.489
and that means more glorious crunchy coating
on our plate.

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:17.879
We’re going to fry them, turning them once
in a while until they develop a beautiful

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:19.980
golden brown color and becomes very crispy.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.290
It doesn’t take long at all. Then we’re
going to move them to a cooling rack and sprinkle

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.409
them with salt and fry the rest of the pieces.

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:33.790
Now I’m going to attend to these fry boys,
or as the English call them chips.

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.840
I’m going to check the temperature and let
the oil come back up to 350 degrees and I’m

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.150
going to finish cooking the French fries until
they are crispy and also golden brown in color.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.599
I’m going to remove them to a cooling rack.

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:51.860
Alright, I’m going to finish with a generous
amount of salt. Then I’m going to plate

00:03:51.860 --> 00:04:08.939
this dish. A little greenery, some fresh lemon
and that’s all it is to it.

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:18.280
Yo, you can grab the recipes at chefkendraseasycooking.com.
You know I got you.

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.910
Check out one of my last videos and share
them. That’s all I have for this week, I’ll

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.900

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:34.490
The first Fish and Chip shop in London is
considered to have opened in 1860 on Cleveland

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.210
Street.
