really really well which is something

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.170 
really really well which is something

getting<00:02:29.400> those<00:02:29.519> killstreaks<00:02:30.120> then<00:02:30.359> is<00:02:30.569> the

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
getting those killstreaks then is the

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.229 
getting those killstreaks then is the
other<00:02:31.170> half<00:02:31.439> and<00:02:31.680> being<00:02:31.980> able<00:02:32.129> to<00:02:32.430> stack<00:02:32.849> them

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
tact well into other scorestreaks so

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.520 
tact well into other scorestreaks so
you're<00:02:51.269> going<00:02:51.389> to<00:02:51.480> notice<00:02:51.629> he's<00:02:52.139> using<00:02:52.500> the

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
you're going to notice he's using the

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.030 
you're going to notice he's using the
lodestar<00:02:53.069> dog<00:02:53.340> swarm<00:02:53.730> this<00:02:53.939> game<00:02:54.180> so<00:02:54.959> what<00:02:55.889> he

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
lodestar dog swarm this game so what he

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.429 
lodestar dog swarm this game so what he
does<00:02:56.220> is<00:02:56.280> he<00:02:56.519> uses<00:02:57.419> his<00:02:57.569> lodestar<00:02:58.049> and<00:02:58.319> then

00:02:58.429 --> 00:02:58.439 
does is he uses his lodestar and then

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:00.140 
does is he uses his lodestar and then
calls<00:02:58.680> in<00:02:58.889> his<00:02:58.919> dogs<00:02:59.280> and<00:02:59.430> swarm<00:02:59.760> which<00:03:00.000> is

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
calls in his dogs and swarm which is

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.539 
calls in his dogs and swarm which is
most<00:03:00.780> of<00:03:00.959> the<00:03:01.019> time<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.530> best<00:03:01.769> way<00:03:02.040> to<00:03:02.099> do<00:03:02.370> it

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
most of the time the best way to do it

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.819 
most of the time the best way to do it
that<00:03:03.359> you're<00:03:03.719> going<00:03:03.810> to<00:03:03.900> notice<00:03:04.079> earlier<00:03:04.409> he

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:04.829 
that you're going to notice earlier he

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:06.709 
that you're going to notice earlier he
actually<00:03:05.010> I<00:03:05.250> think<00:03:05.370> he<00:03:05.669> actually<00:03:05.819> overlaps<00:03:06.540> a

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:06.719 
actually I think he actually overlaps a

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:08.330 
actually I think he actually overlaps a
lodestar<00:03:07.169> which<00:03:07.379> is<00:03:07.530> something<00:03:07.859> that<00:03:07.980> they

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
lodestar which is something that they

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.129 
lodestar which is something that they
probably<00:03:08.579> should<00:03:08.969> patch<00:03:09.180> it's<00:03:09.540> a<00:03:09.750> it's<00:03:10.019> a

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:10.139 
probably should patch it's a it's a

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:11.959 
probably should patch it's a it's a
glitch<00:03:10.379> where<00:03:10.620> if<00:03:10.859> you<00:03:11.099> earn<00:03:11.310> a<00:03:11.340> lodestar

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:11.969 
glitch where if you earn a lodestar

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:13.849 
glitch where if you earn a lodestar
while<00:03:12.180> your<00:03:12.359> aunt<00:03:12.540> lodestar<00:03:13.049> you<00:03:13.349> lose<00:03:13.620> that

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:13.859 
while your aunt lodestar you lose that

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:17.839 
while your aunt lodestar you lose that
second<00:03:14.250> lodestar<00:03:14.700> so<00:03:15.269> if<00:03:15.889> you<00:03:16.889> end<00:03:17.280> up<00:03:17.459> calling

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
second lodestar so if you end up calling

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:20.059 
second lodestar so if you end up calling
in<00:03:17.940> your<00:03:18.060> dogs<00:03:18.329> in<00:03:18.510> swarm<00:03:18.780> first<00:03:19.079> and<00:03:19.409> don't

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
in your dogs in swarm first and don't

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:21.589 
in your dogs in swarm first and don't
call<00:03:20.250> in<00:03:20.340> your<00:03:20.430> lodestar<00:03:20.909> immediately<00:03:21.419> which

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
call in your lodestar immediately which

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.000 
call in your lodestar immediately which
you<00:03:21.870> probably<00:03:22.109> don't<00:03:22.409> want<00:03:22.590> to<00:03:22.620> call<00:03:22.799> it<00:03:22.829> in

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
you probably don't want to call it in

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.990 
you probably don't want to call it in
immediately<00:03:23.400> because<00:03:23.699> then<00:03:23.849> you're<00:03:23.970> just

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
immediately because then you're just

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.250 
immediately because then you're just
going<00:03:24.209> to<00:03:24.299> be<00:03:24.359> stealing<00:03:24.720> kills<00:03:24.930> from<00:03:25.109> your

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
going to be stealing kills from your

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.069 
going to be stealing kills from your
other<00:03:25.379> kill<00:03:25.680> streak<00:03:26.120> if<00:03:27.120> you<00:03:27.569> do<00:03:27.750> call<00:03:27.930> your

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
other kill streak if you do call your

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:29.750 
other kill streak if you do call your
dogs<00:03:28.260> and<00:03:28.470> swarm<00:03:28.680> in<00:03:28.799> first<00:03:29.040> I<00:03:29.220> would<00:03:29.459> try<00:03:29.699> and

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760

possible<00:03:31.919> that<00:03:32.069> is<00:03:32.189> if<00:03:32.400> you're<00:03:32.579> running<00:03:32.790> these

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
possible that is if you're running these

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.330

streaks<00:03:35.639> that<00:03:35.790> I've<00:03:35.939> actually<00:03:36.120> had<00:03:36.540> a<00:03:36.599> lot<00:03:37.139> of

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:37.169 
streaks that I've actually had a lot of

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:40.219 
streaks that I've actually had a lot of
fun<00:03:37.500> using<00:03:37.829> and<00:03:38.329> not<00:03:39.329> only<00:03:39.569> are<00:03:39.689> they<00:03:39.810> fun<00:03:40.049> but

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:40.229 
fun using and not only are they fun but

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:42.469 
fun using and not only are they fun but
they<00:03:40.319> help<00:03:40.500> you<00:03:40.590> level<00:03:40.829> up<00:03:41.010> quickly<00:03:41.310> the<00:03:41.970> UAV

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:42.479 
they help you level up quickly the UAV

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:44.360 
they help you level up quickly the UAV
the<00:03:42.870> counter<00:03:43.169> UAV<00:03:43.349> and<00:03:43.739> the<00:03:43.799> lightning<00:03:44.009> strike

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
the counter UAV and the lightning strike

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.369 
the counter UAV and the lightning strike
stack<00:03:44.729> really<00:03:45.269> well<00:03:45.449> together<00:03:45.659> your

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:46.379 
stack really well together your

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:47.780 
stack really well together your
lightning<00:03:46.590> strike<00:03:46.979> will<00:03:47.159> more<00:03:47.340> often<00:03:47.519> than

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
lightning strike will more often than

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.789 
lightning strike will more often than
not<00:03:47.849> get<00:03:48.269> you<00:03:48.509> pretty<00:03:49.079> close<00:03:49.199> to<00:03:49.470> your<00:03:49.590> next

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
not get you pretty close to your next

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.759 
not get you pretty close to your next
UAV<00:03:50.220> thus<00:03:51.030> going<00:03:51.389> into<00:03:51.599> your<00:03:51.689> counter<00:03:51.989> UAV<00:03:52.139> the

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
UAV thus going into your counter UAV the

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.469 
UAV thus going into your counter UAV the
assists<00:03:53.159> from<00:03:53.250> those<00:03:53.489> will<00:03:53.790> then<00:03:53.939> add<00:03:54.150> up<00:03:54.329> to

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:54.479 
assists from those will then add up to

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:56.270 
assists from those will then add up to
your<00:03:54.599> next<00:03:54.840> lightning<00:03:55.169> strike<00:03:55.439> and<00:03:55.680> you<00:03:56.129> can

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
your next lightning strike and you can

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.710 
your next lightning strike and you can
keep<00:03:56.489> cycling<00:03:56.790> through<00:03:57.150> your<00:03:57.269> killstreak

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
keep cycling through your killstreak

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.009 
keep cycling through your killstreak
obviously<00:03:58.319> if<00:03:59.159> you<00:03:59.310> do<00:03:59.459> not<00:03:59.579> die<00:03:59.849> another<00:04:00.810> one

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
obviously if you do not die another one

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.289 
obviously if you do not die another one
you<00:04:01.680> guys<00:04:01.829> might<00:04:02.129> know<00:04:02.280> the<00:04:02.459> non-lethal<00:04:02.909> set

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
you guys might know the non-lethal set

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.509 
you guys might know the non-lethal set
up<00:04:03.419> the<00:04:03.689> UAV<00:04:04.199> the<00:04:04.319> counter<00:04:04.620> UAV<00:04:04.739> in<00:04:05.040> the<00:04:05.159> V<00:04:05.280> set

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
up the UAV the counter UAV in the V set

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.210 
up the UAV the counter UAV in the V set
which<00:04:05.790> is<00:04:05.939> all<00:04:06.090> kind<00:04:06.449> of<00:04:06.859> what<00:04:07.859> you're<00:04:07.979> trying

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
which is all kind of what you're trying

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.949 
which is all kind of what you're trying
to<00:04:08.280> do<00:04:08.370> there<00:04:08.549> is<00:04:08.729> stack<00:04:09.030> the<00:04:09.239> assists<00:04:09.750> that

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
to do there is stack the assists that

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.589 
to do there is stack the assists that
you<00:04:10.109> get<00:04:10.349> while<00:04:10.620> you're<00:04:10.829> getting<00:04:11.040> kills<00:04:11.599> from

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 
you get while you're getting kills from

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:14.420 
you get while you're getting kills from
the<00:04:12.780> score<00:04:13.049> streak<00:04:13.290> so<00:04:13.560> if<00:04:13.979> you<00:04:14.069> guys<00:04:14.220> don't

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
the score streak so if you guys don't

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.120 
the score streak so if you guys don't
know<00:04:14.639> you<00:04:14.699> get<00:04:15.120> a<00:04:15.150> UAV<00:04:15.750> counter<00:04:16.229> UAV<00:04:16.380> vsat

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
know you get a UAV counter UAV vsat

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.170 
know you get a UAV counter UAV vsat
assists<00:04:17.840> for<00:04:18.840> every<00:04:19.109> kill<00:04:19.409> that<00:04:20.310> anybody<00:04:20.880> gets

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
assists for every kill that anybody gets

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.860 
assists for every kill that anybody gets
throughout<00:04:22.169> the<00:04:22.289> game<00:04:22.469> so<00:04:23.120> and<00:04:24.120> those<00:04:24.330> add<00:04:24.630> to

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
throughout the game so and those add to

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.420 
throughout the game so and those add to
your<00:04:24.990> score<00:04:25.320> streaks<00:04:25.650> so<00:04:25.950> some

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
your score streaks so some

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.540 
your score streaks so some
like<00:04:26.639> UAV<00:04:27.570> counter<00:04:27.900> UAV<00:04:28.020> vsat<00:04:28.650> stacks<00:04:29.039> really

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
like UAV counter UAV vsat stacks really

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.330 
like UAV counter UAV vsat stacks really
well<00:04:29.759> together<00:04:30.000> as<00:04:30.479> compared<00:04:31.199> to<00:04:31.310> you<00:04:32.310> know

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
well together as compared to you know

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.969 
well together as compared to you know
maybe<00:04:32.699> UAV<00:04:33.360> counter<00:04:33.720> UAV<00:04:33.870> and<00:04:34.169> and<00:04:34.710> maybe

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:34.979 
maybe UAV counter UAV and and maybe

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:38.300 
maybe UAV counter UAV and and maybe
something<00:04:35.400> higher<00:04:35.639> than<00:04:35.940> V<00:04:36.120> set<00:04:36.360> so<00:04:37.130> just<00:04:38.130> some

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
something higher than V set so just some

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:39.260 
something higher than V set so just some
things<00:04:38.520> to<00:04:38.669> think<00:04:38.699> about<00:04:38.910> when<00:04:39.180> you're

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
things to think about when you're

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:40.460 
things to think about when you're
playing<00:04:39.449> this<00:04:39.600> game<00:04:39.780> maybe<00:04:40.110> if<00:04:40.320> you're

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
struggling you can't get these really

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.969
