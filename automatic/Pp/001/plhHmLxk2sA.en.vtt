finishing at a canter as well I'll just

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.920 
finishing at a canter as well I'll just
step<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.070> side<00:00:41.250> so<00:00:41.490> you<00:00:41.520> can<00:00:41.730> see<00:00:41.930> oddly

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
step to the side so you can see oddly

step to the side so you can see oddly
Harrison<00:00:43.350> there<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.650> is<00:00:43.740> his<00:00:43.890> brother<00:00:44.130> Terry

Harrison there and is his brother Terry
behind<00:00:44.850> them<00:00:45.030> they're<00:00:45.660> leading<00:00:45.990> the<00:00:46.110> pack<00:00:46.350> but

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:47.330 
behind them they're leading the pack but

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.120 
behind them they're leading the pack but
this<00:00:48.330> is<00:00:48.510> all<00:00:48.690> about<00:00:48.720> high<00:00:49.290> altitude<00:00:49.920> training

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:50.130 
this is all about high altitude training

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.350 
this is all about high altitude training
if<00:00:50.460> you<00:00:50.550> don't<00:00:50.700> know<00:00:50.790> too<00:00:50.850> much<00:00:51.180> about

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
if you don't know too much about

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.080 
if you don't know too much about
altitude<00:00:51.930> training<00:00:52.310> it<00:00:53.310> really<00:00:53.580> benefits

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
altitude training it really benefits

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.630 
altitude training it really benefits
athletes<00:00:54.870> in<00:00:55.170> two<00:00:55.410> main<00:00:55.620> areas<00:00:55.830> on<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.460> on<00:00:56.550> the

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
athletes in two main areas on and on the

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.000 
athletes in two main areas on and on the
one<00:00:56.760> hand<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.210> buffer<00:00:57.720> is<00:00:57.840> hydrogen<00:00:58.440> ions<00:00:58.860> now

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
one hand the buffer is hydrogen ions now

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.130 
one hand the buffer is hydrogen ions now
that<00:00:59.160> means<00:00:59.340> you<00:00:59.430> can<00:00:59.640> combat<00:01:00.060> lactic<00:01:00.780> acid

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
that means you can combat lactic acid

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.609 
that means you can combat lactic acid
and<00:01:01.350> your<00:01:01.830> muscles<00:01:02.220> much<00:01:02.490> much<00:01:02.820> better<00:01:03.090> and

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:03.619 
and your muscles much much better and

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:06.020 
and your muscles much much better and
for<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.650> muscle-bound<00:01:05.040> guy<00:01:05.430> like<00:01:05.700> Audley

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
for a muscle-bound guy like Audley

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.580 
for a muscle-bound guy like Audley
Harris<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.540> danger<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:07.049> that<00:01:07.079> you<00:01:07.469> know

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
Harris and the danger is that you know

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.770 
Harris and the danger is that you know
lactic<00:01:08.189> acid<00:01:08.549> could<00:01:08.759> pile<00:01:09.030> up<00:01:09.210> during<00:01:09.509> a<00:01:09.600> fight

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
lactic acid could pile up during a fight

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.209 
lactic acid could pile up during a fight
he<00:01:09.899> could<00:01:10.049> tighten<00:01:10.499> up<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:10.920> kind<00:01:11.159> of

00:01:11.209 --> 00:01:11.219 
he could tighten up and that kind of

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:12.319 
he could tighten up and that kind of
thing<00:01:11.369> so<00:01:11.399> this<00:01:11.670> kind<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:11.999> training<00:01:12.210> is

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:12.329 
thing so this kind of training is

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:14.630 
thing so this kind of training is
beneficial<00:01:12.749> for<00:01:12.990> that<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:14.009> other<00:01:14.130> area<00:01:14.520> of

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
beneficial for that the other area of

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.359 
beneficial for that the other area of
course<00:01:14.909> is<00:01:15.119> in<00:01:15.270> terms<00:01:15.509> of<00:01:15.749> the<00:01:16.380> way<00:01:16.530> oxygen<00:01:17.009> is

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
course is in terms of the way oxygen is

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.230 
course is in terms of the way oxygen is
recycled<00:01:18.030> around<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.359> body<00:01:18.590> because<00:01:20.240> with

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
recycled around the body because with

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.730 
recycled around the body because with
the<00:01:21.359> air<00:01:21.479> being<00:01:21.749> thinner<00:01:21.990> up<00:01:22.079> here<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.560> body

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
the air being thinner up here the body

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.010 
the air being thinner up here the body
naturally<00:01:22.979> develops<00:01:23.700> more<00:01:23.969> red<00:01:24.329> blood<00:01:24.659> cells

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
naturally develops more red blood cells

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.520 
naturally develops more red blood cells
and<00:01:25.319> that<00:01:25.950> enables<00:01:27.079> oxygen<00:01:28.079> to<00:01:28.409> be

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
and that enables oxygen to be

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.069 
and that enables oxygen to be
transferred<00:01:29.159> around<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.969> body<00:01:30.179> much<00:01:30.810> much

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
transferred around the body much much

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.800 
transferred around the body much much
better<00:01:31.350> much<00:01:32.100> more<00:01:32.340> advantageous<00:01:32.639> sleep<00:01:33.329> on

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
better much more advantageous sleep on

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.480 
better much more advantageous sleep on
your<00:01:33.929> back<00:01:34.139> down<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.530> sea<00:01:34.740> level<00:01:34.770> again<00:01:35.310> but

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
your back down to sea level again but

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.219 
your back down to sea level again but
oddly<00:01:35.670> maybe<00:01:36.299> it's<00:01:36.509> just<00:01:36.600> about<00:01:36.869> got<00:01:37.109> his

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
oddly maybe it's just about got his

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.870 
oddly maybe it's just about got his
breath<00:01:37.439> back<00:01:37.679> you<00:01:37.920> saw<00:01:38.100> we<00:01:38.189> grab<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.399> quick<00:01:38.700> word

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
breath back you saw we grab a quick word

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:39.230 
breath back you saw we grab a quick word
with<00:01:38.909> you

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
with you

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.330 
with you
that's<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:39.780> punishing<00:01:40.259> punishing<00:01:40.740> run<00:01:40.920> to

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
that's a punishing punishing run to

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.879 
that's a punishing punishing run to
watch<00:01:41.490> oddly<00:01:42.240> but<00:01:42.479> how<00:01:43.109> much<00:01:43.289> benefit<00:01:43.679> do<00:01:43.829> you

00:01:43.879 --> 00:01:43.889 
watch oddly but how much benefit do you

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:45.649 
watch oddly but how much benefit do you
derive<00:01:44.130> from<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.460> is<00:01:44.549> it<00:01:44.639> you've<00:01:45.179> got<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:45.359> you

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
derive from it is it you've got a you

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:46.849 
derive from it is it you've got a you
could<00:01:45.810> do<00:01:45.899> it<00:01:46.020> quite<00:01:46.170> easily<00:01:46.319> now<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:46.619> guess

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:46.859 
could do it quite easily now I guess
