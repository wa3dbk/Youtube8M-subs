of grass right the artificial turf you

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.790 
of grass right the artificial turf you
know<00:00:42.540> it's<00:00:42.899> better<00:00:43.170> looking<00:00:43.350> than<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.710> ever

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.330 

no<00:00:51.120> it's<00:00:51.300> it's<00:00:51.570> just<00:00:51.660> based<00:00:52.260> on<00:00:52.500> place<00:00:52.829> right

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
so it's not personal performance it's

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.660 
so it's not personal performance it's
team<00:00:55.260> performance<00:00:55.800> if<00:00:56.039> you<00:00:56.160> kind<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.430> think<00:00:56.489> of

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
team performance if you kind of think of

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.099 
team performance if you kind of think of
it<00:00:56.760> that<00:00:56.910> way<00:00:57.090> again<00:00:57.449> they're<00:00:57.899> the

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
here right here are the recommendations

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.020 
here right here are the recommendations
for<00:01:37.290> their<00:01:37.409> defense<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:38.130> stop<00:01:38.189> me<00:01:38.610> in<00:01:38.759> this<00:01:38.850> one

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
for their defense to stop me in this one

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.850 
for their defense to stop me in this one
one<00:01:39.240> three<00:01:39.420> right<00:01:39.869> I<00:01:40.049> can't<00:01:40.439> select<00:01:40.590> that

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
one three right I can't select that

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.460 
one three right I can't select that
because<00:01:41.130> I'm<00:01:41.250> not<00:01:41.400> that<00:01:41.610> team<00:01:41.880> right<00:01:42.420> so<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.140> can

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
because I'm not that team right so I can

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.929 
because I'm not that team right so I can
probably<00:01:43.799> guess<00:01:44.280> that<00:01:44.490> they're<00:01:44.610> going<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.850> be

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
probably guess that they're going to be

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.190 
probably guess that they're going to be
in<00:01:45.030> one<00:01:45.149> of<00:01:45.270> these<00:01:45.329> packages<00:01:45.840> so<00:01:46.049> it's

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
in one of these packages so it's

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.249 
in one of these packages so it's
actually<00:01:46.590> giving<00:01:46.950> me<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.340> results<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:48.259> true

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
actually giving me the results of true

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.950 
actually giving me the results of true
