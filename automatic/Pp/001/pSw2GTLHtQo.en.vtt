00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.980 

I<00:00:05.130> think<00:00:05.970> if<00:00:06.029> you<00:00:06.090> look<00:00:06.240> at<00:00:06.330> the<00:00:06.450> four<00:00:06.690> key

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
I think if you look at the four key

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.260 
I think if you look at the four key
value<00:00:07.260> propositions<00:00:07.859> of<00:00:07.979> Barcelona<00:00:08.520> you<00:00:09.180> know

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:09.270 
value propositions of Barcelona you know

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:10.810 
value propositions of Barcelona you know
it's<00:00:09.389> going<00:00:09.540> to<00:00:09.629> be<00:00:09.750> the<00:00:09.900> highest<00:00:10.049> performing

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:10.820 
it's going to be the highest performing

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.129 
it's going to be the highest performing
x86<00:00:11.820> processor<00:00:12.389> out<00:00:12.540> there<00:00:12.750> it's<00:00:12.930> going<00:00:13.080> to

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
x86 processor out there it's going to

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.609 
x86 processor out there it's going to
completely<00:00:14.120> blow<00:00:15.120> away<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.870> existing<00:00:16.320> clover

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619

parcel ona is going to be clearly a
leading<00:00:24.599> performance<00:00:24.960> product<00:00:25.500> secondly<00:00:25.980> we

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
leading performance product secondly we

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.580 
leading performance product secondly we
talked<00:00:26.700> about<00:00:26.910> performance<00:00:27.210> for<00:00:27.599> what<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:28.500> in

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
talked about performance for what and in

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.859 
talked about performance for what and in
fact<00:00:28.770> I<00:00:28.890> see<00:00:29.099> that<00:00:29.279> dimension<00:00:29.790> growing<00:00:30.570> much

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
fact I see that dimension growing much

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.990 
fact I see that dimension growing much
stronger<00:00:31.200> as<00:00:31.439> I<00:00:31.980> said<00:00:32.189> earlier<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.700> that<00:00:32.759> is

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
stronger as I said earlier and that is

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.850 
stronger as I said earlier and that is
you're<00:00:33.510> going<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.660> see<00:00:33.899> us<00:00:34.050> continue<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.680> put

and saying you know that piece of paper
again<00:00:42.360> I'm<00:00:42.660> buying<00:00:42.870> on<00:00:43.050> performance<00:00:43.560> for<00:00:43.710> an

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
again I'm buying on performance for an

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.100 
again I'm buying on performance for an
auth<00:00:44.070> per<00:00:44.310> watt<00:00:44.490> no<00:00:44.760> longer<00:00:45.090> am<00:00:45.180> i<00:00:45.240> buying<00:00:45.450> just

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
auth per watt no longer am i buying just

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.780 
auth per watt no longer am i buying just
based<00:00:46.350> on<00:00:46.530> performance<00:00:47.070> so<00:00:47.220> you'll<00:00:47.640> continue

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:47.790 
based on performance so you'll continue

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.630 
based on performance so you'll continue
to<00:00:48.180> see<00:00:48.270> us<00:00:48.690> emphasize<00:00:49.650> our<00:00:50.040> product

thirdly<00:00:56.250> what<00:00:56.730> Steve<00:00:56.970> talked<00:00:57.239> about

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:57.450 
thirdly what Steve talked about

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.780 
thirdly what Steve talked about
virtualization<00:00:58.200> we<00:00:58.890> feel<00:00:59.400> like<00:00:59.579> the

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
virtualization we feel like the

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.300 
virtualization we feel like the
transition<00:01:00.750> to<00:01:00.870> virtualization<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:01.920> not<00:01:02.160> too

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:02.310 
transition to virtualization is not too

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.130 
transition to virtualization is not too
different<00:01:02.730> then<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.420> transition<00:01:03.989> to

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
different then the transition to

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.810 
different then the transition to
performance<00:01:04.619> per<00:01:04.769> watt<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:05.339> know<00:01:05.430> one<00:01:05.640> of<00:01:05.670> the

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
performance per watt you know one of the

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.580 
performance per watt you know one of the
things<00:01:05.880> that<00:01:06.180> happened<00:01:06.570> as<00:01:06.899> people<00:01:07.290> really

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
things that happened as people really

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.200 
things that happened as people really
started<00:01:07.860> purchasing<00:01:08.340> based<00:01:08.579> on<00:01:08.759> performance

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
started purchasing based on performance

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.910 
started purchasing based on performance
for<00:01:09.390> what<00:01:09.540> they<00:01:09.930> saw<00:01:10.110> that<00:01:10.229> Opteron<00:01:10.650> was<00:01:10.800> the

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
for what they saw that Opteron was the

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.710 
for what they saw that Opteron was the
clear<00:01:11.130> leader<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.610> in<00:01:12.090> fact<00:01:12.300> if<00:01:12.479> you<00:01:12.510> went

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
clear leader and in fact if you went

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.780 
clear leader and in fact if you went
into<00:01:12.960> all<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.440> large<00:01:13.650> data<00:01:13.860> centers<00:01:14.310> what

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
into all of the large data centers what

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.570 
into all of the large data centers what
you<00:01:14.940> saw<00:01:15.210> was<00:01:15.659> as<00:01:16.050> people<00:01:16.470> came<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.250> point<00:01:17.490> of

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
you saw was as people came to a point of

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.700 
you saw was as people came to a point of
realizing<00:01:18.210> they<00:01:18.300> could<00:01:18.510> not<00:01:18.690> continue<00:01:19.260> to

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
realizing they could not continue to

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.620 
realizing they could not continue to
scale<00:01:20.220> up<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.520> capability<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.330> their<00:01:21.420> data

customers<00:01:47.040> because<00:01:47.250> they<00:01:47.460> don't<00:01:47.610> have<00:01:47.640> to

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
customers because they don't have to

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.969 
customers because they don't have to
completely<00:01:48.229> re-engineer<00:01:49.229> their<00:01:49.380> platforms

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
completely re-engineer their platforms

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.090 
completely re-engineer their platforms
it<00:01:50.880> also<00:01:51.030> becomes<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.659> big<00:01:51.990> benefit<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.830> our<00:01:52.950> end

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
it also becomes a big benefit to our end

in fact we've had a few customers come

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.480 
in fact we've had a few customers come
in<00:03:41.330> that<00:03:42.230> we're<00:03:42.350> doing<00:03:42.440> some<00:03:42.710> long-term<00:03:42.920> bids

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:43.490

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.360 
in that we're doing some long-term bids
and<00:03:43.880> run<00:03:44.630> their<00:03:44.840> workloads<00:03:45.350> on<00:03:45.710> some<00:03:46.160> of<00:03:46.250> our

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
prototype hardware that you've seen here

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.070 
prototype hardware that you've seen here
today<00:03:48.440> and<00:03:48.920> on<00:03:49.760> all<00:03:50.060> of<00:03:50.330> those<00:03:50.450> cases<00:03:50.750> they

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
today and on all of those cases they

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.010 
today and on all of those cases they
said<00:03:51.260> my<00:03:51.380> goodness<00:03:51.710> this<00:03:52.310> is<00:03:52.720> this<00:03:53.720> is<00:03:53.870> way

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.020 
said my goodness this is this is way

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:55.660 
said my goodness this is this is way
better<00:03:54.200> than<00:03:54.440> we<00:03:54.560> thought<00:03:54.740> so<00:03:55.040> we've<00:03:55.610> been

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
better than we thought so we've been

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.120 
better than we thought so we've been
very<00:03:55.880> encouraged<00:03:56.360> by<00:03:56.480> some<00:03:56.810> of<00:03:56.960> those<00:03:57.410> you

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
very encouraged by some of those you

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:59.950 
very encouraged by some of those you
know<00:03:58.160> it's<00:03:58.490> three<00:03:58.670> data<00:03:58.850> points<00:03:58.940> I<00:03:59.300> think<00:03:59.330> so

00:03:59.950 --> 00:03:59.960 
know it's three data points I think so

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.270 
know it's three data points I think so
you<00:04:00.020> don't<00:04:00.140> want<00:04:00.260> to<00:04:00.320> read<00:04:00.470> too<00:04:00.590> much<00:04:00.740> into<00:04:00.950> it

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
you don't want to read too much into it

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.500 
you don't want to read too much into it
they're<00:04:01.490> very<00:04:01.580> encouraged<00:04:01.940> interesting<00:04:02.330> to

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
they're very encouraged interesting to

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.260 
they're very encouraged interesting to
that<00:04:02.750> story<00:04:03.170> I<00:04:03.230> told<00:04:03.290> earlier<00:04:03.740> about<00:04:04.430> some<00:04:05.180> of

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.270 
that story I told earlier about some of

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:06.490 
that story I told earlier about some of

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
performance for what they're now

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.910 
performance for what they're now

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
wall because they've seen you know that

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.710

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
they're running and so what you'll see

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.510 
they're running and so what you'll see
is<00:04:20.120> a<00:04:20.150> continued<00:04:20.690> emphasis<00:04:20.870> in<00:04:21.440> us<00:04:21.830> educating

folks at power at the wall Opteron looks
even<00:04:26.150> better<00:04:26.300> than<00:04:26.630> it<00:04:26.810> does<00:04:26.930> from<00:04:27.020> TDP<00:04:27.500> steps

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
even better than it does from TDP steps

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.970 
even better than it does from TDP steps
thank<00:04:28.310> mr.<00:04:28.910> competitor<00:04:29.540> I<00:04:30.290> was<00:04:30.590> trying<00:04:30.890> to

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:30.980 
thank mr. competitor I was trying to

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.030 
thank mr. competitor I was trying to
make<00:04:31.520> the<00:04:31.640> case<00:04:31.850> that<00:04:32.170> you<00:04:33.170> know<00:04:33.620> that<00:04:33.860> it's

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
make the case that you know that it's

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.790 
make the case that you know that it's
not<00:04:35.030> manufacturable<00:04:35.780> to<00:04:35.930> call<00:04:36.110> four<00:04:36.350> cores<00:04:36.650> on

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
not manufacturable to call four cores on

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.350 
not manufacturable to call four cores on
a<00:04:36.830> single<00:04:37.220> die<00:04:37.370> and<00:04:37.670> that<00:04:37.700> the<00:04:37.790> yields<00:04:38.180> won't

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
a single die and that the yields won't

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.420 
a single die and that the yields won't
support<00:04:38.930> a<00:04:39.050> business<00:04:39.380> and<00:04:39.530> it's<00:04:39.650> just<00:04:39.830> simply

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
support a business and it's just simply

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.010 
support a business and it's just simply
not<00:04:40.520> true<00:04:40.670> I<00:04:41.180> think<00:04:41.570> it's<00:04:41.660> a<00:04:41.720> convenient

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
not true I think it's a convenient

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.020 
not true I think it's a convenient
argument<00:04:42.590> because<00:04:42.860> they<00:04:43.400> don't<00:04:43.610> have<00:04:43.820> that

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
argument because they don't have that

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.940 
argument because they don't have that
right<00:04:44.210> they<00:04:44.450> have<00:04:44.600> two<00:04:45.110> separate<00:04:45.470> dual<00:04:45.680> core

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:45.950 
right they have two separate dual core

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.310 
right they have two separate dual core
so<00:04:46.580> I<00:04:46.610> think<00:04:46.910> it's<00:04:47.060> just<00:04:47.300> an<00:04:47.690> argument<00:04:47.900> that's

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
so I think it's just an argument that's

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.720 
so I think it's just an argument that's
made<00:04:48.410> of<00:04:48.620> their<00:04:48.740> current<00:04:48.980> situation<00:04:49.160> it's

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:49.730 
made of their current situation it's

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.520 
made of their current situation it's
very<00:04:49.790> easy<00:04:50.090> for<00:04:50.360> us<00:04:50.420> to<00:04:50.510> state<00:04:50.930> and<00:04:51.230> I<00:04:51.320> have

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
very easy for us to state and I have

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.500 
very easy for us to state and I have
many<00:04:51.860> times<00:04:52.160> and<00:04:52.610> many<00:04:52.970> of<00:04:53.090> y'all<00:04:53.240> written

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.510 
many times and many of y'all written

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.630 
many times and many of y'all written
about<00:04:53.660> it<00:04:53.810> about<00:04:54.470> our<00:04:54.650> performance<00:04:55.100> advantage

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:55.640 
about it about our performance advantage

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.190 
about it about our performance advantage
over<00:04:55.820> clover<00:04:56.150> town<00:04:56.390> because<00:04:56.630> the<00:04:56.780> results<00:04:57.110> are

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200 
over clover town because the results are

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.020 
over clover town because the results are
published<00:04:57.320> so<00:04:58.220> I<00:04:58.250> can<00:04:58.490> look<00:04:58.610> at<00:04:58.790> what<00:04:58.820> their

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
published so I can look at what their

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.630 
published so I can look at what their
best<00:04:59.270> publish<00:04:59.990> scores<00:05:00.260> are<00:05:00.530> and<00:05:01.130> I<00:05:01.250> know<00:05:01.310> from

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:01.640 
best publish scores are and I know from

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.190 
best publish scores are and I know from
the<00:05:01.880> work<00:05:02.030> that<00:05:02.180> we're<00:05:02.300> doing<00:05:02.330> internal<00:05:03.050> how

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:03.200 
the work that we're doing internal how

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.200 
the work that we're doing internal how
we're<00:05:03.380> gonna<00:05:03.470> position<00:05:03.620> against<00:05:04.220> that<00:05:04.460> their

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
we're gonna position against that their

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:06.730 
we're gonna position against that their
statements<00:05:05.600> about<00:05:05.750> Penryn<00:05:06.140> or<00:05:06.230> their<00:05:06.380> 45

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
statements about Penryn or their 45

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:07.990 
statements about Penryn or their 45
nanometer<00:05:07.190> product<00:05:07.520> they<00:05:07.610> haven't<00:05:07.880> posted

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
nanometer product they haven't posted

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.870 
nanometer product they haven't posted
those<00:05:08.360> results<00:05:08.810> so<00:05:09.350> it's<00:05:09.470> a<00:05:09.530> little<00:05:09.800> bit<00:05:09.980> of<00:05:10.730> a

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
those results so it's a little bit of a

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.220 
those results so it's a little bit of a
trap<00:05:11.180> right<00:05:11.450> for<00:05:11.630> me<00:05:11.720> to<00:05:11.750> say<00:05:11.960> that<00:05:12.140> we're
