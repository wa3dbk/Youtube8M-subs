can<00:00:00.539> you<00:00:00.630> talk<00:00:00.750> about<00:00:01.020> the<00:00:01.110> lighting<00:00:01.639> yeah<00:00:02.639> so

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
can you talk about the lighting yeah so

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.670 
can you talk about the lighting yeah so
the<00:00:03.030> lighting<00:00:03.330> of<00:00:03.419> this<00:00:03.570> tank<00:00:03.870> I<00:00:04.110> switched

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
the lighting of this tank I switched

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.820 
the lighting of this tank I switched
over<00:00:04.890> I<00:00:05.279> had<00:00:06.150> a<00:00:06.420> metal<00:00:06.629> halide<00:00:06.899> and<00:00:07.350> t5

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
over I had a metal halide and t5

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.580 
over I had a metal halide and t5
lighting<00:00:08.189> above<00:00:08.610> the<00:00:08.760> tank<00:00:09.000> before<00:00:09.210> so<00:00:10.200> now<00:00:10.320> as

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
lighting above the tank before so now as

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.310 
lighting above the tank before so now as
you<00:00:10.620> can<00:00:10.860> see<00:00:10.920> I've<00:00:11.460> got<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.840> Ecotech

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
you can see I've got the Ecotech

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.189 
you can see I've got the Ecotech
radiance<00:00:13.950> up<00:00:14.250> here<00:00:14.519> to<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:14.700> pros<00:00:14.969> so<00:00:15.870> with<00:00:16.109> the

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
radiance up here to the pros so with the

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.590 
radiance up here to the pros so with the
Ecotech<00:00:16.500> radians<00:00:17.180> they've<00:00:18.180> been<00:00:18.390> up<00:00:18.480> here

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
Ecotech radians they've been up here

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.590 
Ecotech radians they've been up here
about<00:00:18.779> six<00:00:19.109> months<00:00:19.470> now<00:00:19.529> I<00:00:19.890> love<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.850> light

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
about six months now I love the light

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.200 
about six months now I love the light
they<00:00:21.750> produce<00:00:21.960> it's<00:00:22.350> pretty<00:00:22.619> good<00:00:22.830> I<00:00:23.100> did<00:00:23.789> a

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
they produce it's pretty good I did a

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.839 
they produce it's pretty good I did a
little<00:00:24.570> bit<00:00:24.689> of<00:00:24.750> overkill<00:00:25.140> on<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.859> amount<00:00:26.640> in

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
little bit of overkill on the amount in

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.740 
little bit of overkill on the amount in
the<00:00:26.970> array<00:00:27.210> of<00:00:27.330> these<00:00:27.810> lights<00:00:28.880> but<00:00:29.880> I<00:00:30.240> did<00:00:30.599> that

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
the array of these lights but I did that

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.920 
the array of these lights but I did that
in<00:00:30.929> order<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.910> create<00:00:32.910> lighting<00:00:33.420> where<00:00:33.630> it

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
in order to create lighting where it

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.479 
in order to create lighting where it
wasn't<00:00:34.200> just<00:00:34.380> hitting<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.800> coral<00:00:35.100> from<00:00:35.340> maybe

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
wasn't just hitting the coral from maybe

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.430 
wasn't just hitting the coral from maybe
one<00:00:35.760> side<00:00:36.000> of<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.149> coral<00:00:36.480> or<00:00:36.660> just<00:00:37.200> getting

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
one side of the coral or just getting

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.729 
one side of the coral or just getting
really<00:00:38.360> spotlighted<00:00:39.360> effect<00:00:39.660> so<00:00:40.320> this<00:00:40.530> kind

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
really spotlighted effect so this kind

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.250 
really spotlighted effect so this kind
of<00:00:40.770> gives<00:00:40.950> coral<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.670> chance<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.450> grow<00:00:42.660> with

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
of gives coral a chance to grow with

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.770 
of gives coral a chance to grow with
light<00:00:43.500> coming<00:00:43.829> in<00:00:43.920> all<00:00:44.010> sides<00:00:44.340> of<00:00:44.489> it<00:00:44.640> now<00:00:45.510> with

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
light coming in all sides of it now with

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.680 
light coming in all sides of it now with
metal<00:00:46.079> halides<00:00:46.379> have<00:00:46.620> good<00:00:47.239> spectrum<00:00:48.239> they're

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
metal halides have good spectrum they're

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.470 
metal halides have good spectrum they're
really<00:00:49.260> good<00:00:49.440> spread<00:00:49.770> with<00:00:50.760> these<00:00:50.969> lights<00:00:51.270> I

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
really good spread with these lights I

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.510 
really good spread with these lights I
feel<00:00:51.690> like<00:00:51.870> with<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.289> maybe<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.399> new

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
feel like with the maybe the new

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.430 
feel like with the maybe the new
technology<00:00:54.059> that's<00:00:54.239> out<00:00:54.390> they've<00:00:54.989> caught<00:00:55.289> up

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
technology that's out they've caught up

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.600 
technology that's out they've caught up
or<00:00:55.590> something<00:00:55.860> but<00:00:56.010> it's<00:00:56.129> been<00:00:56.250> doing<00:00:56.460> really

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
or something but it's been doing really

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.880 
or something but it's been doing really
well<00:00:56.730> I've<00:00:57.449> noticed<00:00:57.719> really<00:00:58.079> good<00:00:58.379> growth<00:00:58.649> and

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
well I've noticed really good growth and

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.209 
well I've noticed really good growth and
then<00:00:59.190> coral<00:00:59.840> Entertainment<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:00.899> here<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.379> I

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
then coral Entertainment is here and I

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.149 
then coral Entertainment is here and I
love<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.390> kind<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.199> light<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:04.920> produces

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
love the the kind of light that produces

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.920 
love the the kind of light that produces
I<00:01:05.460> can<00:01:05.610> get<00:01:05.760> anything<00:01:06.000> from<00:01:06.360> yellow<00:01:06.659> lighting

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
I can get anything from yellow lighting

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.380 
I can get anything from yellow lighting
to<00:01:07.260> very<00:01:07.439> blue<00:01:07.740> lighting<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:09.060> can<00:01:09.210> even

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
to very blue lighting and I can even

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.820 
to very blue lighting and I can even
have<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:09.689> change<00:01:09.960> throughout<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.320> door<00:01:10.470> day

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
have that change throughout the door day

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.080 
have that change throughout the door day
so<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.670> starts<00:01:12.000> off<00:01:12.150> as<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.960> know<00:01:13.080> more<00:01:13.290> yellow

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
so it starts off as you know more yellow

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.850 
so it starts off as you know more yellow
sunlight<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.540> then<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.140> goes<00:01:16.290> into<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.619> nice

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
sunlight and then it goes into a nice

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.910 
sunlight and then it goes into a nice
blue<00:01:17.700> lighting<00:01:18.090> as<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.540> night<00:01:18.780> goes<00:01:18.960> on<00:01:19.140> so

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
blue lighting as the night goes on so

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.310 
blue lighting as the night goes on so
right<00:01:20.070> now<00:01:20.220> this<00:01:20.430> is<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.700> equivalent<00:01:21.090> of<00:01:21.320> it's

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
right now this is the equivalent of it's

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.530 
right now this is the equivalent of it's
about<00:01:22.650> 14k<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.909> looks<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.150> little<00:01:24.240> bit<00:01:24.390> more

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
about 14k it looks a little bit more

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.600 
about 14k it looks a little bit more
blue<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:25.020> me<00:01:25.140> but<00:01:26.100> I<00:01:26.369> definitely<00:01:27.150> like<00:01:28.610> the

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
blue to me but I definitely like the

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.950 
blue to me but I definitely like the
amount<00:01:29.790> of<00:01:29.939> lights<00:01:30.210> that<00:01:30.329> we're<00:01:30.570> using<00:01:30.750> and

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
amount of lights that we're using and

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.649 
amount of lights that we're using and
even<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:32.070> height<00:01:32.369> so<00:01:32.790> we<00:01:32.820> have<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.210> height<00:01:33.420> of

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
even the height so we have the height of

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.350 
even the height so we have the height of
it<00:01:33.840> about<00:01:34.020> 18<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.890> 20<00:01:34.920> inches<00:01:35.430> which<00:01:35.970> is<00:01:36.000> more

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
it about 18 to 20 inches which is more

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.899 
it about 18 to 20 inches which is more
than<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.689> suggest

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
than the suggest

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.809 
than the suggest
by<00:01:38.359> the<00:01:38.420> manufacturer<00:01:38.990> but<00:01:39.679> I<00:01:39.950> did<00:01:40.399> that<00:01:40.579> so<00:01:40.759> I

00:01:40.809 --> 00:01:40.819 
by the manufacturer but I did that so I

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:43.270 
by the manufacturer but I did that so I
can<00:01:40.909> get<00:01:41.030> better<00:01:41.119> spread<00:01:41.630> on<00:01:42.020> the<00:01:42.170> coil<00:01:42.380> where

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
can get better spread on the coil where

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.760 
can get better spread on the coil where
if<00:01:43.670> you<00:01:43.850> have<00:01:43.969> it<00:01:44.090> too<00:01:44.270> close<00:01:44.600> you<00:01:45.439> get<00:01:45.560> two

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
if you have it too close you get two

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:46.120 
if you have it too close you get two
things

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
things

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.770 
things
the<00:01:46.340> part<00:01:46.640> might<00:01:46.819> be<00:01:46.850> too<00:01:47.149> strong<00:01:47.420> and<00:01:47.689> these

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
the part might be too strong and these

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.919 
the part might be too strong and these
things<00:01:48.020> do<00:01:48.200> have<00:01:48.380> very<00:01:48.590> good<00:01:48.679> part<00:01:49.929> speaking

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:50.929 
things do have very good part speaking

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:53.679 
things do have very good part speaking
of<00:01:51.020> the<00:01:51.109> part<00:01:51.350> at<00:01:52.060> the<00:01:53.060> par<00:01:53.240> meter<00:01:53.390> we<00:01:53.539> got

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
of the part at the par meter we got

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:55.959 
of the part at the par meter we got
about<00:01:53.810> 600<00:01:54.200> right<00:01:54.709> beneath<00:01:55.009> the<00:01:55.219> surface<00:01:55.429> even

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:55.969 
about 600 right beneath the surface even

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:57.819 
about 600 right beneath the surface even
with<00:01:56.090> the<00:01:56.179> lights<00:01:56.359> being<00:01:56.600> this<00:01:56.689> high<00:01:56.899> about

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 
with the lights being this high about

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:01.830 
with the lights being this high about
450<00:01:58.670> part<00:01:58.939> where<00:01:59.539> most<00:01:59.840> of<00:01:59.959> the<00:02:00.049> SPS<00:02:00.469> start<00:02:00.799> and

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
450 part where most of the SPS start and

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.089 
450 part where most of the SPS start and
300<00:02:02.840> somewhere<00:02:03.259> a<00:02:03.289> little<00:02:03.469> below<00:02:03.799> the<00:02:03.950> middle

300 somewhere a little below the middle
and<00:02:04.700> at<00:02:04.789> the<00:02:04.909> bottom<00:02:05.209> about<00:02:05.329> 250<00:02:06.200> to<00:02:06.319> 200<00:02:06.950> which

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
and at the bottom about 250 to 200 which

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:11.440 
and at the bottom about 250 to 200 which
is<00:02:08.410> overkill<00:02:09.410> for<00:02:09.670> some<00:02:10.670> kinds<00:02:10.910> of<00:02:10.970> LPS<00:02:11.420> and

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
is overkill for some kinds of LPS and

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.380 
is overkill for some kinds of LPS and
softies<00:02:12.019> but<00:02:12.709> they<00:02:13.040> handle<00:02:13.400> it<00:02:13.549> and<00:02:13.700> it<00:02:14.209> gives

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
softies but they handle it and it gives

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.600 
softies but they handle it and it gives
me<00:02:14.599> the<00:02:14.750> opportunity<00:02:15.079> to<00:02:15.590> put<00:02:15.799> SPS<00:02:16.220> plural

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
me the opportunity to put SPS plural

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:17.890 
me the opportunity to put SPS plural
where<00:02:17.180> I<00:02:17.209> please

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
where I please

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.069 
where I please
now<00:02:18.879> they've<00:02:19.879> been<00:02:20.150> like<00:02:20.629> I<00:02:20.660> said<00:02:20.870> up<00:02:20.959> and

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:21.079 
now they've been like I said up and

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:22.449 
now they've been like I said up and
running<00:02:21.260> for<00:02:21.440> six<00:02:21.620> months<00:02:21.920> we've<00:02:22.010> got<00:02:22.220> good

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
running for six months we've got good

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.520 
running for six months we've got good
crawl<00:02:22.760> growth<00:02:23.060> now<00:02:23.900> the<00:02:24.019> other<00:02:24.260> thing<00:02:24.410> that's

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
crawl growth now the other thing that's

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.280 
crawl growth now the other thing that's
been<00:02:24.709> beneficial<00:02:25.069> is<00:02:25.730> I<00:02:26.480> like<00:02:26.720> how<00:02:26.900> my<00:02:27.079> light

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
been beneficial is I like how my light

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.270 
been beneficial is I like how my light
bill<00:02:27.500> looks<00:02:27.799> now

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
bill looks now

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.890 
bill looks now
so<00:02:28.700> my<00:02:28.849> lighting<00:02:29.150> bill<00:02:29.299> has<00:02:29.450> come<00:02:29.480> down

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
so my lighting bill has come down

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.069 
so my lighting bill has come down
substantially<00:02:31.390> some<00:02:32.390> of<00:02:32.480> that<00:02:32.569> is<00:02:32.780> from<00:02:32.959> the

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:33.079 
substantially some of that is from the

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:34.839 
substantially some of that is from the
cost<00:02:33.319> of<00:02:33.590> the<00:02:33.739> lights<00:02:33.950> themselves<00:02:34.220> being

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
cost of the lights themselves being

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.240 
cost of the lights themselves being
cheaper<00:02:35.209> to<00:02:35.540> run<00:02:35.629> per<00:02:35.870> watt<00:02:36.109> but<00:02:36.799> also<00:02:36.980> the

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
cheaper to run per watt but also the

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.190 
cheaper to run per watt but also the
other<00:02:37.430> part<00:02:37.700> of<00:02:37.940> that<00:02:38.090> is<00:02:38.569> the<00:02:38.810> fact<00:02:38.930> that<00:02:39.049> my

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
other part of that is the fact that my

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.770 
other part of that is the fact that my
chiller<00:02:39.530> is<00:02:39.709> not<00:02:39.890> going<00:02:40.160> on<00:02:40.310> as<00:02:41.180> often<00:02:41.569> so

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
chiller is not going on as often so

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.960 
chiller is not going on as often so
throughout<00:02:42.109> the<00:02:42.260> winter<00:02:42.590> I<00:02:42.829> didn't<00:02:43.700> have<00:02:43.819> my

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
throughout the winter I didn't have my

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.599 
throughout the winter I didn't have my
children<00:02:44.209> go<00:02:44.450> on<00:02:44.510> once<00:02:44.950> as<00:02:45.950> to<00:02:46.220> or<00:02:46.340> when<00:02:46.459> I<00:02:46.519> hit

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:46.609 
children go on once as to or when I hit

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:49.720 
children go on once as to or when I hit
the<00:02:46.730> middle<00:02:46.970> halides<00:02:47.329> and<00:02:47.599> the<00:02:47.660> T<00:02:47.840> fives<00:02:48.079> I<00:02:49.069> had

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
the middle halides and the T fives I had

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.490 
the middle halides and the T fives I had
chillers<00:02:50.569> going<00:02:50.840> on<00:02:50.930> at<00:02:51.049> least<00:02:51.260> when<00:02:51.440> the

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
chillers going on at least when the

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.979 
chillers going on at least when the
lights<00:02:51.709> went<00:02:51.889> on<00:02:52.010> so<00:02:52.819> the<00:02:53.299> lighting<00:02:53.510> bill<00:02:53.750> came

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
lights went on so the lighting bill came

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.500 
lights went on so the lighting bill came
down<00:02:54.200> the<00:02:55.040> lights<00:02:55.340> seem<00:02:55.730> to<00:02:55.849> be<00:02:55.970> doing<00:02:56.480> very

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
down the lights seem to be doing very

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.199 
down the lights seem to be doing very
well<00:02:56.720> I<00:02:57.019> have<00:02:57.230> them<00:02:57.440> hooked<00:02:58.069> up<00:02:58.250> to<00:02:58.489> a<00:02:58.519> lift

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
well I have them hooked up to a lift

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.420 
well I have them hooked up to a lift
here<00:02:59.660> where<00:03:00.349> with<00:03:00.530> the<00:03:00.620> present<00:03:00.980> but<00:03:01.130> I<00:03:01.280> can

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
here where with the present but I can

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.759 
here where with the present but I can
get<00:03:01.549> it<00:03:01.579> to<00:03:01.760> go<00:03:01.790> higher<00:03:02.540> or<00:03:02.840> lower<00:03:03.019> I<00:03:03.139> like<00:03:03.530> this

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
get it to go higher or lower I like this

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.979 
get it to go higher or lower I like this
height<00:03:04.040> it<00:03:04.700> actually<00:03:05.030> gives<00:03:05.180> me<00:03:05.329> the<00:03:05.510> ability

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
height it actually gives me the ability

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:07.659 
height it actually gives me the ability
to<00:03:06.230> work<00:03:06.380> on<00:03:06.709> the<00:03:06.799> tank<00:03:06.980> without<00:03:07.160> even<00:03:07.549> moving

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:07.669 
to work on the tank without even moving

00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:11.860 
to work on the tank without even moving
it<00:03:07.970> so<00:03:08.959> the<00:03:09.859> lights<00:03:10.069> have<00:03:10.310> been<00:03:10.690> pretty<00:03:11.690> good

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
it so the lights have been pretty good

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.109 
it so the lights have been pretty good
so<00:03:12.079> far
