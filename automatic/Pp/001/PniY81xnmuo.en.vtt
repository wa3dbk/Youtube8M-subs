00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
connect is unplug from your computer at

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.140 
connect is unplug from your computer at
the<00:00:25.350> time<00:00:25.590> next<00:00:26.130> thing<00:00:26.279> 1<00:00:26.580> download<00:00:26.760> is<00:00:27.060> the

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
Kinect for Windows SDK this I think is

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.099 
Kinect for Windows SDK this I think is
the<00:00:29.490> thing<00:00:29.550> that<00:00:29.699> makes<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.090> Xbox<00:00:30.510> 360

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
the thing that makes the Xbox 360

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.020 
the thing that makes the Xbox 360
version<00:00:31.289> work<00:00:32.070> with<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.489> computer<00:00:32.820> but<00:00:32.910> I'm

so<00:02:33.890> to<00:02:34.160> get<00:02:34.250> a<00:02:34.310> cinematic<00:02:35.150> view<00:02:35.240> where<00:02:35.420> you

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
so to get a cinematic view where you

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.150 
so to get a cinematic view where you
can't<00:02:35.840> see<00:02:35.990> the<00:02:36.080> Connecticut's<00:02:36.590> camera<00:02:36.980> and
