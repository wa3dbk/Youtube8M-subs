at<00:00:19.150> first<00:00:20.050> I<00:00:20.410> was<00:00:20.650> a<00:00:20.680> little<00:00:21.000> skeptical<00:00:22.000> of

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:22.330 
at first I was a little skeptical of

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.600 
at first I was a little skeptical of
trying<00:00:23.230> anything<00:00:23.590> new<00:00:23.800> when<00:00:24.310> we<00:00:24.430> first

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:24.610 
trying anything new when we first

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.880 
trying anything new when we first
started<00:00:24.790> well<00:00:25.180> if<00:00:25.270> we<00:00:25.360> had<00:00:25.510> a<00:00:25.540> certain<00:00:25.840> idea<00:00:26.350> of

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:26.890 
started well if we had a certain idea of

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.150 
started well if we had a certain idea of
what<00:00:27.100> this<00:00:27.580> whole<00:00:27.789> genre<00:00:27.850> was<00:00:28.390> about<00:00:28.690> and

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
what this whole genre was about and

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.490 
what this whole genre was about and
after<00:00:30.160> being<00:00:30.780> more<00:00:31.780> involved<00:00:32.050> with<00:00:32.379> it

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:32.500 
after being more involved with it

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.020 
after being more involved with it
obviously<00:00:32.890> and<00:00:33.190> listening<00:00:33.460> to<00:00:33.520> other<00:00:33.730> stuff

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030 
obviously and listening to other stuff

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.630 
obviously and listening to other stuff
we<00:00:34.780> grew<00:00:35.050> as<00:00:35.289> musicians<00:00:36.010> and<00:00:36.250> we<00:00:36.430> grew<00:00:36.610> our

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.640 
we grew as musicians and we grew our

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.900 
we grew as musicians and we grew our
interest<00:00:37.120> grew<00:00:37.270> and<00:00:37.570> there<00:00:38.050> and<00:00:38.290> also<00:00:38.440> the

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
interest grew and there and also the

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.370 
interest grew and there and also the
music<00:00:39.910> we<00:00:40.180> said<00:00:40.390> you<00:00:40.540> know<00:00:40.630> what<00:00:40.780> there's<00:00:41.290> a

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:41.380 
music we said you know what there's a

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.110 
music we said you know what there's a
lot<00:00:41.560> of<00:00:41.590> new<00:00:41.829> stuff<00:00:41.860> coming<00:00:42.130> out<00:00:42.550> of<00:00:42.610> Germany

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 
lot of new stuff coming out of Germany

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.790 
lot of new stuff coming out of Germany
coming<00:00:43.480> out<00:00:43.570> of<00:00:43.600> Austria<00:00:44.200> at<00:00:44.290> the<00:00:44.410> time<00:00:44.620> it<00:00:44.770> was

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
coming out of Austria at the time it was

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.850 
coming out of Austria at the time it was
Alpine<00:00:45.310> rock<00:00:45.610> and<00:00:45.970> we<00:00:46.960> thought<00:00:47.170> you<00:00:47.230> know<00:00:47.380> this

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:47.860 
Alpine rock and we thought you know this

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.350 
Alpine rock and we thought you know this
is<00:00:47.920> something<00:00:48.280> that<00:00:48.460> I<00:00:48.610> think<00:00:48.850> the<00:00:48.940> American

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.360 
is something that I think the American

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.380 
is something that I think the American
public<00:00:49.510> can<00:00:49.840> really<00:00:50.140> get<00:00:50.380> behind<00:00:51.210> it's<00:00:52.210> not

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
public can really get behind it's not

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.049 
public can really get behind it's not
your<00:00:52.840> typical<00:00:53.260> oompah<00:00:53.980> music<00:00:54.040> I<00:00:54.670> think<00:00:54.940> what

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:55.059 
your typical oompah music I think what

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:57.600 
your typical oompah music I think what
separates<00:00:55.540> DSP<00:00:56.260> from<00:00:56.559> other<00:00:56.980> bands<00:00:57.280> in<00:00:57.489> our

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610 
separates DSP from other bands in our

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.650 
separates DSP from other bands in our
genre<00:00:57.640> is<00:00:58.380> that<00:00:59.380> we<00:00:59.469> use<00:00:59.680> rock<00:00:59.950> as<00:01:00.250> a<00:01:00.660> context

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
genre is that we use rock as a context

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.049 
genre is that we use rock as a context
and<00:01:01.809> the<00:01:01.890> traditional<00:01:02.890> German<00:01:03.190> has<00:01:03.280> a<00:01:03.309> subtext

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
and the traditional German has a subtext

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:05.789 
and the traditional German has a subtext
whereas<00:01:04.839> other<00:01:04.989> bands<00:01:05.320> do<00:01:05.439> it<00:01:05.560> the<00:01:05.649> other<00:01:05.680> way

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:05.799 
whereas other bands do it the other way

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:08.419 
whereas other bands do it the other way
around<00:01:05.890> we<00:01:06.790> always<00:01:06.969> like<00:01:07.299> to<00:01:07.329> take<00:01:07.749> chances
