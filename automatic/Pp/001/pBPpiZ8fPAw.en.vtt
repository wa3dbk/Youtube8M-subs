00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 why does it need good lighting when 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.210
 we do an inlay on a green background 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.490
 hello to all here franÃ§ois for 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:13.019
 pro video training and I'm going to you 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:15.480
 show these here and there is good I move 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.240
 my arms stupidly but all that for you 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:22.140
 show that if you try to flip 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.180
 this image well, well, it'll do 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.269
 something a little disgusting we 'll say 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.800
 to remove this drag this blur of 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.289
 shake 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.120
 it's quite difficult actually to look at 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.899
 when we do an incrustation so 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.300
 the idea is that every move every 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.980
 that here is a move be made to the 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.140
 camera very precisely 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.960
 there for example I set my camera on 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.200
 a 25th 2 seconds my shutter 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.690
 manchester and that I do not do it 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.940
 obviously never especially that's when I 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.610
 goes through a video controller that is a 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.489
 it is a system a little bit capricious 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.359
 to do a live clipping there he 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.090
 there is no right to the error that is to 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.580
 to say that if I'm doing this on 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.500
 this rule I'm going to have a drag a 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.360
 little disgusting that is to say that my 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.010
 blur of shake will mix with the 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.600
 background color and that's them 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.310
 programs have a little trouble managing it 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.280
 and what drives us once again to 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.830
 boost the settings is what he does 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.729
 a degradation of the image and that we do not 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.430
 obviously does not want it so the solution 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:30.659
 it is to put a shooter to 60 even 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:33.030
 120 120 a 120th 2 seconds 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.890
 you can do it normally on to 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.680
 just about every camera 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.600
 which have manual settings even the 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.820
 point cameras lepreau break time 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.299
 in time so check that on your 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.950
 equipment 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.100
 obviously all the cameras pro the 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.500
 background or appliances so picture this 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.670
 you will want to do it though 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.170
 obviously to have good lighting 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.140
 because the more you will have a buyer 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.869
 high - you will have light from where 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.939
 the interest of having good lighting 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.340
 is to see this high shooter and there you 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.780
 have a quality no case there I you 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.700
 thanks for watching this video 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.649
 I hope you have been useful 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.780
 do not hesitate to ask me questions 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.069
 if you have it just below 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.380
 this video and I will be happy 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.700
 to answer them 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:18.460
 I'll see you soon for a 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.460
 new tutorial is good shooting
