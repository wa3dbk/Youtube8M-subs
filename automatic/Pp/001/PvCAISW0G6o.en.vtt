00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.879
 nolwenn we will now learn to 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.190
 ask for work protections so 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:20.310
 leggings so we use gaiters 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:23.700
 to protect the bottom of the members of the 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.630
 pony especially at the level of the tendons of 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.990
 protect from shocks 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.330
 so we use the gaiters on on the 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.250
 work on the dish but also during 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.620
 obstacle sessions or outdoors 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.780
 okay so the materials used 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.679
 so we find plastic gaiters 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.390
 most of the time they 

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:43.800
 can be as leather and now 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.800
 we find leggings with materials 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.530
 composites kind with gel or so of 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.609
 carbon like this but the most 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.460
 current anyway these are the gaiters 

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:57.030
 plastic with tuning velcro 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:00.329
 like this one so for breaks and 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.429
 we put ourselves next to his pony then we 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.749
 will position saga 3 there we did it 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:05.700
 slide a little bit so that the stoves 

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:08.070
 underneath be well smooth and in English 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.360
 the bowl and then we pay attention that 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.009
 the debt is not too high for not 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.680
 annoy the knee crease because there 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:15.030
 also it could hurt him 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.100
 then the scratch will leave 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.770
 always dax to the outside so we go 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.950
 close the first scratch the one below 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.039
 the second here and we flap the little 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.689
 tongue and after we check that the 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:30.719
 gaiters hold well not that the 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.100
 watch it returns niglis okay it takes 

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:34.799
 not too much greenhouse and not for not 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.780
 compress the tendons so there it here 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.179
 is very smooth 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.100
 we have to choose a gaiter to adapt the 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:43.229
 size of his pony 1 the gaiter must 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.049
 not be too big should not go up 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.730
 too high nor too low down must 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.140
 well encompass the bowl and calf 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.780
 you must not choose a strike either 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.400
 to be too small we will place 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.770
 now protects them wanted them 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.930
 therefore have the function of protecting 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.120
 the bouley I remember that we put well 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.880
 gaiters he protects the ball by 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.770
 pair so we position to its protects 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.330
 so wanted the coast inward 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.310
 the scratches always outward 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.500
 I slide a little bit my protector 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.620
 ball game report then the first 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.060
 scratch and the second stage to avoid 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.370
 that whoever is under stand out 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:22.000
 then I check that we protect 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.980
 cannonball can not turn or descend 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.350
 which is not enough 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:30.940
 not for not understood but the 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:32.890
 tendon so now tenor enough of 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.200
 gaiter to the interiors and his two 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.420
 protects ball in the posterior 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.600
 it is well protected and we will be able to 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.600
 to work
