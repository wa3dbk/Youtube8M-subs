00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
cool

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.730 
cool
I'll<00:02:20.280> try<00:02:20.490> to<00:02:20.520> put<00:02:20.850> that<00:02:21.030> under<00:02:21.470> five<00:02:22.470> minute

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
I'll try to put that under five minute

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.950 
I'll try to put that under five minute
so<00:02:23.370> it<00:02:23.490> is<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.730> back<00:02:23.880> sorry<00:02:24.570> for<00:02:24.840> the

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
so it is the back sorry for the

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.920 
so it is the back sorry for the
reflection<00:02:25.380> so<00:02:26.100> it's<00:02:26.400> very<00:02:26.550> nice<00:02:26.820> it's<00:02:27.690> a<00:02:27.810> bit

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
reflection so it's very nice it's a bit

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.250 
reflection so it's very nice it's a bit
like<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.320> insertion<00:02:28.920> thing<00:02:29.660> no<00:02:30.660> with<00:02:30.900> all<00:02:31.110> the

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
like the insertion thing no with all the

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.280 
like the insertion thing no with all the
building<00:02:31.470> and<00:02:31.950> all<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.400> thing<00:02:32.610> and<00:02:32.940> you<00:02:33.690> can't

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
building and all the thing and you can't

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.930 
building and all the thing and you can't
even<00:02:34.440> see<00:02:34.740> me<00:02:34.770> in<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.100> reflection<00:02:35.460> right<00:02:35.760> now

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
even see me in the reflection right now

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.470 
even see me in the reflection right now
so<00:02:36.230> it<00:02:37.230> is<00:02:37.290> what<00:02:37.590> it<00:02:37.620> is<00:02:37.890> so<00:02:38.310> it's<00:02:38.490> very<00:02:38.970> very

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
so it is what it is so it's very very

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:47.780 
so it is what it is so it's very very
cool<00:02:40.130> let's<00:02:41.130> take<00:02:41.280> a<00:02:41.310> look<00:02:41.459> closer<00:02:46.040> so<00:02:47.040> all<00:02:47.310> the

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:04.430 

you<00:02:56.040> got<00:02:56.220> ear<00:02:56.670> um<00:02:58.010> the<00:03:00.500> just<00:03:01.500> a<00:03:01.620> code<00:03:02.900> and<00:03:03.900> after

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
you got ear um the just a code and after

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.540 
you got ear um the just a code and after
that<00:03:05.300> you<00:03:06.300> got<00:03:06.510> the<00:03:06.720> disc<00:03:07.320> with<00:03:08.160> the<00:03:08.280> artwork

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
that you got the disc with the artwork

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:14.740 
that you got the disc with the artwork
very<00:03:09.030> cool<00:03:09.270> I<00:03:09.300> really<00:03:09.450> like<00:03:09.690> it<00:03:09.930> and<00:03:10.880> yes<00:03:12.110> sorry

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
very cool I really like it and yes sorry

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:26.360 
very cool I really like it and yes sorry
okay<00:03:15.750> so<00:03:16.410> and<00:03:17.510> the<00:03:18.510> other<00:03:18.780> one<00:03:23.150> yes<00:03:24.739> very<00:03:25.739> nice

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
okay so and the other one yes very nice

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:36.430 
okay so and the other one yes very nice
so<00:03:27.269> let's<00:03:27.510> check<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:28.489> ice<00:03:29.489> outside<00:03:30.000> artwork

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.220 

try<00:03:37.440> to<00:03:37.500> show<00:03:37.860> you<00:03:37.920> without<00:03:38.220> the<00:03:38.459> reflection

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
try to show you without the reflection

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.630 
try to show you without the reflection
okay<00:03:40.230> I<00:03:40.350> think<00:03:40.590> it's<00:03:40.709> worth<00:03:40.920> right<00:03:41.160> now<00:03:41.190> so<00:03:41.489> as

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
okay I think it's worth right now so as

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.699 
okay I think it's worth right now so as
you<00:03:41.730> can<00:03:41.820> see<00:03:42.000> without<00:03:42.180> the<00:03:42.420> reflection<00:03:42.930> it's

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
you can see without the reflection it's

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.920 
you can see without the reflection it's
like<00:03:43.890> the<00:03:44.070> web<00:03:44.400> and<00:03:44.760> the<00:03:45.000> building<00:03:45.420> on<00:03:45.690> the

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
like the web and the building on the

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.130 
like the web and the building on the
back<00:03:46.400> it's<00:03:47.400> pretty<00:03:47.610> yeah<00:03:47.910> I<00:03:48.360> don't<00:03:48.930> really

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
back it's pretty yeah I don't really

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.170 
back it's pretty yeah I don't really
know<00:03:49.380> at<00:03:50.160> first<00:03:50.220> I<00:03:50.489> thought<00:03:50.640> it<00:03:50.760> was<00:03:50.790> amazing

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
know at first I thought it was amazing

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.360 
know at first I thought it was amazing
and<00:03:51.540> after<00:03:51.810> that<00:03:51.930> I<00:03:51.989> was<00:03:52.530> like<00:03:52.590> mmm

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
and after that I was like mmm

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.310 
and after that I was like mmm
you<00:03:53.820> know<00:03:53.880> sure<00:03:54.060> but<00:03:54.239> still<00:03:54.360> it's<00:03:55.230> a<00:03:55.290> pretty

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
and it is glossy so it will take

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.120 
and it is glossy so it will take
fingerprint<00:04:03.030> of<00:04:03.540> course<00:04:04.140> but<00:04:04.410> still<00:04:04.440> very

amazing<00:04:42.390> still<00:04:42.780> but<00:04:42.960> it<00:04:43.230> is<00:04:43.440> region-free<00:04:43.920> and

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
amazing still but it is region-free and

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.970 
amazing still but it is region-free and
a<00:04:44.730> movie<00:04:45.000> is<00:04:45.030> pretty<00:04:45.420> good<00:04:45.600> I<00:04:45.810> don't<00:04:46.710> really

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:46.980 
a movie is pretty good I don't really

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:50.570 
a movie is pretty good I don't really
like<00:04:47.160> Andrew<00:04:47.820> Garfield<00:04:48.360> in<00:04:49.050> the<00:04:49.140> movie<00:04:49.580> but

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
like Andrew Garfield in the movie but

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.700 
like Andrew Garfield in the movie but
still<00:04:50.940> the<00:04:51.660> movies<00:04:51.930> pretty<00:04:52.140> good<00:04:52.350> I<00:04:52.560> think

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
still the movies pretty good I think

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.480 
still the movies pretty good I think
it's<00:04:53.040> very<00:04:53.640> different<00:04:54.270> from<00:04:54.540> the<00:04:54.860> some<00:04:55.860> Sam

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
it's very different from the some Sam

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.720 
it's very different from the some Sam
Raimi<00:04:56.790> trilogy<00:04:57.200> spider-man<00:04:58.520> it's<00:04:59.520> very

00:04:59.720 --> 00:04:59.730 
Raimi trilogy spider-man it's very

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:03.920 
Raimi trilogy spider-man it's very
different<00:04:59.970> I<00:05:00.360> really<00:05:00.750> like<00:05:00.870> it<00:05:01.140> and<00:05:01.380> yes<00:05:02.930> also

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
different I really like it and yes also
