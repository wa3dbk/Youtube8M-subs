score<00:01:38.100> so<00:01:38.490> we<00:01:38.579> do<00:01:38.729> actually<00:01:39.030> get<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.720> gold<00:01:40.200> one

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
score so we do actually get a gold one

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.590 
score so we do actually get a gold one
on<00:01:40.710> no<00:01:41.369> silver<00:01:41.820> we<00:01:41.939> get<00:01:42.090> silver<00:01:42.450> that's

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
on no silver we get silver that's

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.109 
on no silver we get silver that's
annoying<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.079> will<00:01:43.500> we<00:01:43.530> do<00:01:43.829> do<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.850> next

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
annoying and will we do do the next

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.760 
annoying and will we do do the next
challenge<00:01:45.299> which<00:01:45.600> is<00:01:45.750> apparently<00:01:45.960> kicks<00:01:46.350> now

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
challenge which is apparently kicks now

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.580 
challenge which is apparently kicks now
these<00:01:46.920> ones<00:01:47.130> are<00:01:47.520> pretty<00:01:47.549> easy<00:01:48.299> on<00:01:48.750> this<00:01:49.350> as

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
these ones are pretty easy on this as

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.109 
these ones are pretty easy on this as
you<00:01:49.740> do<00:01:49.920> have<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.159> guide<00:01:50.490> as<00:01:50.700> you<00:01:50.790> can<00:01:50.939> see

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
you do have the guide as you can see

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.670 
you do have the guide as you can see
there<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:51.750> need<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.990> hold<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.380> analog<00:01:52.649> stick

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
there you need to hold the analog stick

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.130 
there you need to hold the analog stick
to<00:01:53.610> like<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.240> don't<00:01:54.479> hold<00:01:54.659> it<00:01:54.840> all<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.049> way

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
to like you don't hold it all the way

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.109 
to like you don't hold it all the way
over<00:01:55.470> you<00:01:55.860> actually<00:01:56.040> aim<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.729> then<00:01:56.969> the

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
over you actually aim and then the

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.969 
over you actually aim and then the
amount<00:01:57.360> of<00:01:57.420> power<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:57.750> put<00:01:57.990> on<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:58.320> depends<00:01:58.649> on

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
amount of power you put on it depends on

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.280 
amount of power you put on it depends on
where<00:01:59.610> where<00:01:59.909> bouts<00:02:00.149> is<00:02:00.329> going<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.570> go<00:02:00.719> so<00:02:01.140> we

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
where where bouts is going to go so we

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.719 
where where bouts is going to go so we
actually<00:02:01.590> didn't<00:02:02.100> hit<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.310> tagger<00:02:02.520> them

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
actually didn't hit the tagger them

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.310 
actually didn't hit the tagger them
which<00:02:02.880> is<00:02:02.909> quite<00:02:03.180> annoying<00:02:03.450> but<00:02:03.990> I'm<00:02:04.049> not<00:02:04.170> bad

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
which is quite annoying but I'm not bad

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.840

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
the ball very well obviously if you can

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.030

who fit with your foot you do get a bit
of<00:05:12.100> an<00:05:12.490> a<00:05:12.940> bit<00:05:13.210> of<00:05:13.300> a<00:05:13.360> bonus<00:05:13.750> as<00:05:13.900> well<00:05:14.139> and

of an a bit of a bonus as well and

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.290 
of an a bit of a bonus as well and
hopefully<00:05:14.800> he<00:05:15.190> does<00:05:15.400> do<00:05:15.520> a<00:05:15.550> low<00:05:15.790> cross<00:05:16.030> so<00:05:16.240> I

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
hopefully he does do a low cross so I

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.740 
hopefully he does do a low cross so I
can<00:05:16.479> assure<00:05:16.570> you<00:05:17.580> bang<00:05:18.580> nice<00:05:19.030> that<00:05:19.510> we

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
can assure you bang nice that we

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.180 
can assure you bang nice that we
actually<00:05:19.900> did<00:05:20.139> that<00:05:20.169> spawned<00:05:20.620> about<00:05:20.919> even

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.190 
actually did that spawned about even

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.760 
actually did that spawned about even
having<00:05:21.400> two<00:05:21.580> were<00:05:21.789> having<00:05:22.450> to<00:05:22.780> retry<00:05:23.380> that<00:05:23.590> and

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 
having two were having to retry that and

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:25.560 
having two were having to retry that and
I<00:05:23.830> struggled<00:05:24.039> at<00:05:24.280> our<00:05:24.370> first<00:05:24.610> time<00:05:24.820> and<00:05:25.479> the

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:25.570 
I struggled at our first time and the

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:27.300 
I struggled at our first time and the
next<00:05:25.750> one<00:05:26.050> and<00:05:26.260> I<00:05:26.410> think<00:05:26.650> this<00:05:26.889> is<00:05:27.070> the<00:05:27.190> last

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
next one and I think this is the last

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.790 
next one and I think this is the last
one<00:05:27.490> as<00:05:27.610> well<00:05:27.760> actually<00:05:28.270> maybe<00:05:28.660> it<00:05:29.560> might<00:05:29.680> not

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
one as well actually maybe it might not

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.860 
one as well actually maybe it might not
be<00:05:29.860> this<00:05:30.070> close<00:05:30.340> control<00:05:30.639> city<00:05:30.970> like<00:05:31.389> skinning

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
be this close control city like skinning

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:33.719 
be this close control city like skinning
and<00:05:32.289> then<00:05:32.380> you<00:05:32.470> shoot<00:05:32.680> in<00:05:32.889> which<00:05:33.280> is<00:05:33.490> pretty

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:33.729 
and then you shoot in which is pretty

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:35.760 
and then you shoot in which is pretty
easy<00:05:34.000> anyway<00:05:34.389> so<00:05:34.720> you<00:05:34.810> pressing<00:05:34.990> the<00:05:35.169> l1

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770 
easy anyway so you pressing the l1

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.779 
easy anyway so you pressing the l1
bought<00:05:36.220> our<00:05:37.120> one<00:05:37.419> button<00:05:37.690> I<00:05:37.870> think<00:05:38.370> yeah<00:05:39.370> is<00:05:39.610> it

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:39.789 
bought our one button I think yeah is it

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:42.000 
bought our one button I think yeah is it
the<00:05:39.880> other<00:05:39.970> one<00:05:40.260> no<00:05:41.260> it's<00:05:41.440> the<00:05:41.530> hour<00:05:41.710> one

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.010 
the other one no it's the hour one

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:43.290 
the other one no it's the hour one
button<00:05:42.250> you<00:05:42.310> press<00:05:42.460> him<00:05:42.580> for<00:05:42.639> the<00:05:42.789> close

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 
button you press him for the close

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.930 
button you press him for the close
control<00:05:43.630> and<00:05:44.620> you<00:05:44.680> just<00:05:44.830> tap<00:05:45.070> it<00:05:45.099> position

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:45.940 
control and you just tap it position

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.909 
control and you just tap it position
yourself<00:05:46.030> and<00:05:46.479> shoot<00:05:46.930> which<00:05:47.349> does<00:05:47.590> come<00:05:47.800> in

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 
yourself and shoot which does come in

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:50.150 
yourself and shoot which does come in
very<00:05:48.099> handy<00:05:48.190> against<00:05:48.820> the<00:05:48.970> opponent's<00:05:49.479> I<00:05:49.599> am

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.160 
very handy against the opponent's I am

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.980 
very handy against the opponent's I am
as<00:05:51.160> you<00:05:51.280> can<00:05:51.460> see<00:05:51.639> there<00:05:51.820> it<00:05:52.690> sends<00:05:52.930> the

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:52.990 
as you can see there it sends the

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:54.870 
as you can see there it sends the
opponent's<00:05:53.410> off<00:05:53.500> it<00:05:53.650> adds<00:05:53.860> a<00:05:54.130> closer<00:05:54.430> dribble

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 
opponent's off it adds a closer dribble

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.060 
opponent's off it adds a closer dribble
as<00:05:54.970> well<00:05:55.150> so<00:05:55.630> you<00:05:55.720> can<00:05:55.780> like<00:05:56.050> sidestep<00:05:56.710> there

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:57.070 
as well so you can like sidestep there

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:59.279 
as well so you can like sidestep there
and<00:05:57.340> completely<00:05:57.760> feel<00:05:58.030> like<00:05:58.210> I<00:05:58.450> just<00:05:58.510> did<00:05:58.780> so

00:05:59.279 --> 00:05:59.289 
and completely feel like I just did so

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:02.839 
and completely feel like I just did so
it'd<00:05:59.410> be<00:05:59.440> a<00:05:59.560> bit<00:05:59.710> quicker<00:05:59.979> on<00:06:00.280> that<00:06:00.520> one<00:06:00.700> I

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:02.849 
it'd be a bit quicker on that one I

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:07.040 
it'd be a bit quicker on that one I
forgot<00:06:03.849> to<00:06:03.970> keep<00:06:04.240> in<00:06:04.389> it<00:06:04.539> now<00:06:04.690> what<00:06:04.900> the<00:06:05.080> hell

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
forgot to keep in it now what the hell

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:10.350 
forgot to keep in it now what the hell
let's<00:06:08.050> try<00:06:08.260> finesse<00:06:08.620> it<00:06:08.800> nice<00:06:09.550> girl<00:06:09.849> oh<00:06:10.030> yeah

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:10.360 
let's try finesse it nice girl oh yeah

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.930 
let's try finesse it nice girl oh yeah
so<00:06:10.810> finesse<00:06:11.340> control<00:06:12.340> shot<00:06:12.550> actually<00:06:12.700> almost

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:12.940 
so finesse control shot actually almost

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:17.310 
so finesse control shot actually almost
light<00:06:13.240> here<00:06:15.180> I've<00:06:16.180> gone<00:06:16.330> out<00:06:16.479> I<00:06:16.720> can<00:06:17.169> actually

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:17.320 
light here I've gone out I can actually

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.990 
light here I've gone out I can actually
I<00:06:17.530> can<00:06:17.860> actually<00:06:18.190> go<00:06:18.280> out<00:06:18.400> with<00:06:18.580> the<00:06:18.820> thing

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:19.000 
I can actually go out with the thing

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.610 
I can actually go out with the thing
I've<00:06:19.120> just<00:06:19.330> realized<00:06:19.720> that<00:06:19.930> so<00:06:20.410> you<00:06:20.500> can

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:20.620 
I've just realized that so you can

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.920 
I've just realized that so you can
actually<00:06:20.650> as<00:06:21.010> long<00:06:21.039> as<00:06:21.250> you<00:06:21.340> press<00:06:21.520> the<00:06:22.180> hour

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:22.930 
actually as long as you press the hour

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:24.420 
actually as long as you press the hour
one<00:06:23.169> button<00:06:23.440> in<00:06:23.560> there<00:06:23.710> to<00:06:23.889> get<00:06:24.039> you<00:06:24.160> dribble

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:24.430 
one button in there to get you dribble

from the nice done it I've actually
teaching<00:06:44.320> myself<00:06:44.440> something<00:06:44.860> yeah<00:06:45.010> I<00:06:45.190> need<00:06:45.460> to

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:45.580 
teaching myself something yeah I need to

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.670

step<00:06:45.850> up<00:06:45.940> my<00:06:46.000> shooting<00:06:46.389> game<00:06:46.570> so<00:06:46.840> that<00:06:47.470> was

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:47.680 
step up my shooting game so that was

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.320 
step up my shooting game so that was
that<00:06:47.860> one<00:06:48.010> done<00:06:48.220> we<00:06:48.340> did<00:06:48.460> get<00:06:48.610> a<00:06:48.669> silver<00:06:49.150> on

that and I think that was the end of

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:54.810 
that and I think that was the end of
this<00:06:52.860> intermediate<00:06:53.860> tutorial<00:06:54.550> as<00:06:54.639> well
