00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 moving moments will be at eifel tv 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.200
 presented to you by the pixel mainz 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:11.960
 media of her video production from mayen 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.960
 thus remains to reliable alive 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.590
 yes, love football fans it is 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.169
 served as you say so beautiful 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.750
 best weather awaits us here today in 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:35.030
 on the twenty-first day of play 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.910
 the meeting is so united Mendig bell 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.790
 against the fv engers the mendiger the yes 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.489
 in the week before 3 to 1 at Eintracht 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.980
 Trier 2 could win today 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:48.530
 here already an important step in 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.540
 the direction to the class whereabouts in the 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.329
 rheaallee gaal but as I said 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.739
 the game must first be played and 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:56.620
 we'll just have a look inside 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.570
 the first half 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:02.320
 the mendiger gave the beginning of the game 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.910
 against engers unfortunately not a good picture 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.789
 Chances really worth mentioning it 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.770
 the hosts had no engers 

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:11.050
 on the other hand, it showed after the success 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.280
 against the sport friends eisbachtal 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.160
 determined also this game for itself 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.700
 to decide 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.700
 16 minutes 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:27.870
 Captain Arne Moskopp gets the ball 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:34.410
 goes well with vitaly popov who shoots 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:36.810
 but only the post after one 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:41.700
 Mario also tries to throw snow white 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:47.550
 on the part of the guests unfortunately luck 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:51.320
 just missed a good 30 minutes after 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.320
 then start this scene 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.830
 Raphael Bernard with a pass to 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.229
 strong björn chandler 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:08.399
 he comes before the late man 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:10.910
 the first goal of the game to 0 1 for the 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.910
 fv engers 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:23.090
 This gate was just the beginning 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:23.090
 five minutes before half-time 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:33.170
 christopher freisberg is kicking the corner and 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.270
 again it was vitaly popov here 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.630
 the supposed second hit 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:41.290
 the impartial decided 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.290
 on the sidelines 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.530
 with the score of 0 2 1 it went in 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.470
 the second half of the game 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.540
 now also the visitors got in mendig 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.310
 more and more the feeling that the 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:02.180
 homeowners do not play the game without a fight 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:11.600
 want to give up chance for niclas 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:14.090
 Heimann the last thirty minutes of play 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:18.590
 were broken and both teams 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:21.080
 now fight emphasizes jan krämer brings 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.420
 thomas nürnberg in the penal area to fall 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:27.130
 what lukas big and also chandler 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:32.650
 to get carried away 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.650
 the consequence twice red and eleven meters 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:47.380
 Niclas heimann certainly transforms here 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:47.380
 for 1 to 1 the compensation for mendig 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:54.300
 now it got really hectic 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:57.010
 substitutes mandy k dennis simon 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.260
 But the ball ends up with Raphael 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:02.620
 bernhard himself with the ball on and 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.890
 of it makes the mendiger salafi sees 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.930
 here only one possibility 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.840
 actually a clear red card though 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:13.620
 umpire emic left it at yellow 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.620
 good luck for the homeowners 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.980
 coach wolfgang müller left 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.510
 new entry lukas runs in the square one 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.410
 smart choice as later 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.410
 will turn out 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:38.169
 2 minutes in the replay time 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:40.870
 my ex captain john rausch plays up 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:44.290
 youngster lukas the link runs the ball 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:46.620
 safe in the housing of the guests to 2 1 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.620
 under 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:55.180
 so that the sg just saved the 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:58.260
 three points and so on the 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.260
 eleventh table place 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.830
 So, 1 0 deserves kids 20 then 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.080
 not acknowledged 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.220
 I personally know 20 too strong 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.720
 But you have to see it then 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.830
 So once I will be expired on ski 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.030
 First you have to see it 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:17.530
 maybe right from the television 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:19.060
 or soja yes then after the half-time I 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.590
 The crew had already said that 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.820
 we there that is hard in the weather 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:24.610
 especially when the enemy makes more and 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:26.650
 then this shed to put more on it 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.390
 yes, that was very difficult for us 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.340
 have the time needed but against 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:33.460
 even stronger guitars deserve to sound 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:35.260
 do it 1 1 yes and then there was one 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.060
 phase I would say was already where 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:40.090
 you thought it was undecided 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:42.280
 and then have the knife out of counter 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:44.140
 now good second round three games three 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:47.260
 points if you still have the catch-up game 

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:49.060
 against karbach so top started first 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.010
 official game for the sg concord 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.300
 mendig bell and then immediately 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:55.240
 important goal 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.890
 how is your conclusion the madness before 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.770
 everything here at the whole scenery horny 

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:01.870
 weather so many spectators and then wolf 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:03.070
 held tomorrow asks lukas roma 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:04.479
 the bag method out says first 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:06.820
 wolfgang I can play for 

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:09.400
 certainly fulfilled 

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:12.280
 10 20 minutes out for him as says okay 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.930
 then just ask for frank this 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:16.690
 if I come in now it was already 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:19.120
 the evening worked out yes dear 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:22.330
 football fans at the end wins the sg 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:24.640
 Eintracht mendig bell with 2 1 against the 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:26.169
 fv engers and one we have to, of course 

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.789
 That's it 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:29.110
 Of course the one who took care of it 

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:30.849
 that it finally comes to an end 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:34.110
 wolfram was still enough for the victory 

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:36.580
 müller overjoyed I think now 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:39.070
 yes already happy to say 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:41.140
 but due to the way of playing tonart 

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:42.909
 We clearly deserve the threesome 

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:45.070
 you were just a team there I was 

00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:46.800
 absolutely not satisfied I think 

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:49.479
 We enjoyed the sun but 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.860
 Now you have the sun in the back came 

00:06:49.479 --> 00:06:54.090
 but playing better back was nice 

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:54.090
 Warm gas subgroups
