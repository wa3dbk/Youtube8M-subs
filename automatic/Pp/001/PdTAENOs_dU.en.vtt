00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.740 
last pair is this down here was too
tight<00:03:06.550> so<00:03:07.530> what<00:03:08.530> I<00:03:08.560> did<00:03:08.680> is<00:03:08.980> I<00:03:09.160> tried<00:03:09.610> to<00:03:09.730> get<00:03:10.090> at

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
tight so what I did is I tried to get at

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.400 
tight so what I did is I tried to get at
least<00:03:11.550> 14<00:03:12.550> inches<00:03:12.880> out<00:03:13.060> of<00:03:13.209> it<00:03:13.360> so<00:03:14.290> that's

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
least 14 inches out of it so that's

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.300 
least 14 inches out of it so that's
about<00:03:14.640> the<00:03:15.640> length<00:03:15.849> of<00:03:15.970> a<00:03:16.860> regular<00:03:17.860> locks<00:03:18.100> off

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
about the length of a regular locks off

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.430 
about the length of a regular locks off
you<00:03:18.459> can<00:03:18.610> buy<00:03:18.900> online<00:03:20.220> so<00:03:22.110> you<00:03:23.110> bring<00:03:23.350> it

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
you can buy online so you bring it

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.979 
you can buy online so you bring it
instead<00:03:23.769> of<00:03:24.209> keeping<00:03:25.209> this<00:03:25.360> on<00:03:25.569> here<00:03:25.810> you

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
instead of keeping this on here you

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:27.509 
instead of keeping this on here you
would<00:03:26.110> just<00:03:26.140> come<00:03:26.410> up<00:03:26.440> about<00:03:26.799> 14<00:03:27.220> inches<00:03:27.459> and

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
would just come up about 14 inches and

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.130 
would just come up about 14 inches and
cut<00:03:27.819> it<00:03:27.940> but<00:03:28.330> usually<00:03:28.540> it's<00:03:28.840> big<00:03:29.019> enough

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
cut it but usually it's big enough

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.759 
cut it but usually it's big enough
because<00:03:29.530> you're<00:03:29.830> using<00:03:30.010> the<00:03:30.130> thigh<00:03:30.400> part<00:03:30.790> down

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
because you're using the thigh part down

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.990 
because you're using the thigh part down
usually<00:03:32.769> the<00:03:32.890> ankle<00:03:33.250> part<00:03:33.459> is<00:03:33.549> a<00:03:33.580> little<00:03:33.850> too

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
usually the ankle part is a little too

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.759 
usually the ankle part is a little too
tight<00:03:34.239> so<00:03:34.269> you<00:03:34.510> just<00:03:34.750> come<00:03:34.930> up<00:03:34.959> about<00:03:35.319> 14

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
tight so you just come up about 14

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:37.440 
tight so you just come up about 14
inches<00:03:35.799> if<00:03:36.400> you<00:03:36.430> have<00:03:36.580> shorter<00:03:36.940> hair<00:03:36.970> you<00:03:37.299> can

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
inches if you have shorter hair you can

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.809 
inches if you have shorter hair you can
even<00:03:37.630> come<00:03:37.750> up<00:03:37.780> 12<00:03:38.170> inches<00:03:38.530> however<00:03:39.519> long<00:03:39.670> you

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:39.819 
even come up 12 inches however long you

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.210 
even come up 12 inches however long you
feel<00:03:40.030> you<00:03:40.180> may<00:03:40.360> need<00:03:40.540> it<00:03:40.720> but<00:03:41.350> I'm<00:03:41.890> not<00:03:42.100> going

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
feel you may need it but I'm not going

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.570 
feel you may need it but I'm not going
to<00:03:42.310> touch<00:03:42.430> this<00:03:42.640> one<00:03:42.880> because<00:03:43.390> this<00:03:43.720> is

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
to touch this one because this is

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.370 
to touch this one because this is
obviously<00:03:45.580> wide<00:03:45.880> enough<00:03:46.150> to<00:03:46.360> use<00:03:46.569> just<00:03:47.319> like

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
obviously wide enough to use just like

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:53.490 
obviously wide enough to use just like
it<00:03:47.620> is<00:03:47.739> so<00:03:49.350> that's<00:03:50.350> it<00:03:50.620> that<00:03:51.459> simple<00:03:52.470> let<00:03:53.470> me

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
it is so that's it that simple let me

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.289 
it is so that's it that simple let me
know<00:03:53.680> if<00:03:53.769> you<00:03:53.890> do<00:03:54.070> this<00:03:54.280> and<00:03:54.579> if<00:03:54.940> you<00:03:55.060> have<00:03:55.150> any

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
know if you do this and if you have any

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:58.590 
know if you do this and if you have any
other<00:03:55.450> ideas<00:03:55.930> I<00:03:56.200> would<00:03:56.320> love<00:03:56.980> to<00:03:57.400> know<00:03:57.579> see<00:03:58.510> you

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
other ideas I would love to know see you

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:07.240 
other ideas I would love to know see you
later

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250
