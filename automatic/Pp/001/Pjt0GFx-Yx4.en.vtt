00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 this question made people argue until 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.259
 hoarses from the time of the ancient Greeks to 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:11.090
 of our days and the answer is still not found 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.090
 first chicken or egg 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.789
 if you understand the question literally the answer 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.490
 simple her cycle of the soul animals appeared 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.750
 well before the hens strictly speaking egg where 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.210
 older chicken 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.220
 but more accurate wording chicken or 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.949
 hen egg confronts us 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.680
 endless loop of cause and effect then 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.739
 eat if chicken hatched from egg 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.680
 where did the egg is probably the other 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.140
 chicken which is also from the egg so it was 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.390
 first on one side of the field team 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.129
 hens according to scientists to form 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.070
 chicken eggs need protein 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.770
 and Ive 17 and he is only in the ovaries 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.079
 chickens without it a chicken eggshell 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.170
 can form that is without chicken 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.629
 no chicken eggs will work but 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.300
 here comes the question of determining what the general 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.659
 such a chicken egg is an egg which 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.290
 laid a chicken or just an egg with a chicken 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.840
 inside 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.340
 it's clear that avi chicken with protein 17 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.619
 was supposed to come from somewhere 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.869
 but if the elephant will carry an egg out of which 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.040
 it was a pizza years old it would be an elephant egg 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.049
 or lion 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.600
 this brings us to the team version 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.640
 opponent egg club in progress 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.549
 breeding two organisms share their 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.610
 genetic code of the form of dna but this dna 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.570
 never copied one hundred percent 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.360
 exactly often in the new organism 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.880
 there are slight differences over 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.640
 thousands of generations these tiny mutations in 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.470
 DNA creates new species but 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.140
 there are mutations in the yawning 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.990
 the original cell and this is 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.119
 one single huge cell then 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.979
 there is very much like a chicken being 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.590
 let's call him about chicken 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.350
 arguing about the rooster and because of the little 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.049
 mutations appeared first chicken of course 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.840
 But from an egg it means at first there was an egg 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:03.180
 Of course the hens team will say that 1 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.640
 the chicken just grew in chicken egg pro 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.190
 however, no species on earth was born 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.560
 from a single mutation though we 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.160
 adore rubbing animals on classes squads 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.750
 and species 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.550
 it reflects today 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.890
 and the state of affairs and not what was 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.110
 millions of years ago the evolutionary process 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.060
 so slow that no particular 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.820
 Kurina Smoked family was not 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.130
 pioneers of a new species here is an example 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.780
 dogs are descended from wolves 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.910
 when people started to lure 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.880
 there was no moment to domesticate the wolves 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.190
 when the wolf suddenly gave birth to a dog instead 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.770
 this was a gradual artificial 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.500
 selection ie we collected wolves which 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.630
 were not afraid of people and were not very angry and 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.910
 after hundreds of generations became noticeable 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.160
 a huge difference in genetics and behavior 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.530
 and what follows from this we have left 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.660
 two options are some ancient eggs 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.390
 the cemetery and the birds gradually turned 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.670
 in about chicken cemetery you about eggs in 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.320
 one of them occurred mutation which 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.989
 gave the domesticated hens some 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:04.050
 advantage this was the first chicken 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:06.660
 who started laying chicken eggs in 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.970
 In this case, the chicken was the first or 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.940
 we have about the chicken that gave birth 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.370
 normal chicken and therefore the egg should be 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.980
 call the chicken then the first was the egg 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:20.190
 and here we are back to the definitions 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.560
 and the question of what is a chicken egg question 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.570
 something must be said in a meaningless finite 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.150
 in the end everyone will agree whether the egg was 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:29.630
 chicken or proto chicken 1 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:33.739
 one hundred percent chicken hatched from an egg 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.739
 the egg was the first 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:41.070
 ehson seems it does not happen much sometimes 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.260
 it even seems that it is acutely lacking but 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.470
 what happens if you completely give up 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.470
 sleep
