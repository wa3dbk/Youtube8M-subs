not

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.369 
not
I<00:00:37.010> think<00:00:38.010> your<00:00:38.129> discretion<00:00:39.090> I<00:00:39.660> think<00:00:40.170> Steve

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
I think your discretion I think Steve

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.650 
I think your discretion I think Steve
might<00:00:40.620> have<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.800> handle<00:00:41.129> on<00:00:41.190> this<00:00:41.309> one<00:00:41.660> okay

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
might have a handle on this one okay

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.630 
might have a handle on this one okay
yeah<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:42.960> suspicion<00:00:43.649> why<00:00:44.219> do<00:00:44.280> you<00:00:44.370> say<00:00:44.489> that

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
yeah a suspicion why do you say that

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.240 
yeah a suspicion why do you say that
well<00:00:45.629> I<00:00:45.660> think<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.379> might<00:00:46.500> be<00:00:46.710> from<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:47.010> place

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
well I think it might be from a place

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.040 
well I think it might be from a place
that<00:00:47.280> he<00:00:47.520> travels<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:47.969> quite<00:00:48.329> frequently

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
that he travels to quite frequently

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.799 
that he travels to quite frequently
he<00:00:49.200> knows<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.590> wines<00:00:49.800> fairly<00:00:50.670> well<00:00:50.850> yeah<00:00:51.780> I

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
he knows the wines fairly well yeah I

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.200 
he knows the wines fairly well yeah I
think<00:00:52.079> it's<00:00:52.199> from<00:00:52.289> New<00:00:52.440> Zealand<00:00:52.469> so<00:00:53.100> I<00:00:53.760> think

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
think it's from New Zealand so I think

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.819 
think it's from New Zealand so I think
the<00:00:54.300> nose<00:00:54.449> kind<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:54.960> gives<00:00:55.170> it<00:00:55.289> away<00:00:55.440> but<00:00:55.739> then

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
the nose kind of gives it away but then

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.049 
the nose kind of gives it away but then
when<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.129> get<00:00:56.190> in<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.340> mouth<00:00:56.460> Lee<00:00:56.730> it's<00:00:56.969> a

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
when you get in the mouth Lee it's a

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.090 
when you get in the mouth Lee it's a
very<00:00:57.239> lightweight<00:00:57.449> rating<00:00:58.050> so<00:00:58.320> other<00:00:58.920> words

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
very lightweight rating so other words

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.319 
very lightweight rating so other words
you<00:00:59.219> start<00:00:59.399> thinking<00:00:59.760> about<00:00:59.820> what<00:01:00.059> could<00:01:00.270> that

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
you start thinking about what could that

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:00.770 
you start thinking about what could that
be

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
be

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.540 
be
and<00:01:00.870> Pinot<00:01:01.590> Noir<00:01:01.680> is<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.160> thing<00:01:02.340> that<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.489> think

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
and Pinot Noir is the thing that I think

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.270 
and Pinot Noir is the thing that I think
of<00:01:02.789> immediately<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.570> nose<00:01:03.840> just<00:01:04.260> leaps<00:01:05.070> out

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
of immediately the nose just leaps out

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.160 
of immediately the nose just leaps out
of<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.430> glass<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.880> just<00:01:06.060> screams<00:01:06.479> red<00:01:06.869> very

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
of the glass it just screams red very

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.100 
of the glass it just screams red very
fruit<00:01:07.590> cherry<00:01:08.070> ripe<00:01:08.820> really<00:01:09.299> ripe<00:01:09.510> red<00:01:09.869> berry

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
herbaceous nough stew which suggests to

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.219 
herbaceous nough stew which suggests to
me<00:01:22.070> maybe<00:01:23.180> one<00:01:24.180> something<00:01:24.600> from<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:24.960> southern
