 very good night this first Saturday of 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:25.120

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.920
 hail rain snowfall at low elevations and 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.420
 above all highlights the day of 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.819
 today is the decrease in temperatures 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.530
 that we have noticed in practically everything 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:34.989
 the country a very sharp decline that 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.819

 those maximum temperatures recorded 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:41.560
 I'm comparing them with yesterday's ones like 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.360
 is the case of bilbao yesterday 22 today 11 so 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.610
 Only in Lugo they beat us in the days 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.440
 of maximum in segovia in córdoba also 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.200
 it was noticeable in the south that thermal descent 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.580
 and yet we talked about the opposite 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.290
 how the temperatures increased 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.860
 Valencian community in Castellón yesterday 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.420
 19 today 24 and that there has also been 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.610
 noticed the step that front system with 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.340
 those skies that appeared above all that 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:05.769
 in a good part of the country this next 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.690
 night will be colder and tomorrow by day 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:09.640
 it will also be a colder day in general 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.489
 with temperatures that will fall 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.890
 about 46 degrees in the downtown area even 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:17.560
 hangars broadcast radio or in the Balearics 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.780
 also tomorrow we will continue talking a 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.079
 snowy spring sunday those 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.030
 snowfall that one 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:24.110
 in the Cantabrian mountain range in areas of 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.479
 the Pyrenees that could even 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.159
 accumulate 5 centimeters thick and 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:30.500
 we will also talk tomorrow, Sunday 

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:32.090
 intense wind that will leave gusts even 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.409
 that could exceed the 80s punctually 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.419
 kilometers per hour in much of the 

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:36.949
 peninsular northeast quadrant and this 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:38.930
 maritime situation that appears again 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:41.750
 altered in the Cantabrian slope with 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.550
 waves up to five meters high 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.250
 We made notice event as a salt can 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.810
 appreciate the step of the tail of that 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.280
 front that has been marking the day 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.110
 is that the first Saturday of spring 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.780
 and moving away from the Mediterranean's headquarters 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.789
 and it is also appreciated as activated those 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.550
 stormy squalls in the afternoon in the 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:05:00.740
 today afternoon in areas of Catalonia these 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.569
 masses these our voided reflect 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.190
 that cold air that keeps coming in with 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:06.770
 the north and that is responsible for leaving 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.569
 a Sunday again cooler in good 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.190
 part of the country although sunnier and is 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:12.590
 that tomorrow we look for a good situation 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.000
 more clear in the downtown area in the 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.039
 south with those clouds that will follow 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.690
 concentrated in the northern third and 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:20.210
 storms still in the morning that could 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:22.520
 affect towards barcelona girona north of 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.930
 Balearics with that level snow 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.750
 It is too low to start the day 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.430
 tomorrow with only 600 800 meters 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.470
 in channels we also expect rain 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.600
 weak that could leave us in the north 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.460
 of the islands especially during the 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.680
 tomorrow with temperatures we have said 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.720
 tonight it will be colder and the morning 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.040
 tomorrow during the day also the 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.630
 maximums will fall in much of the 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.220
 country only reaching 10 degrees of 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:45.370
 maximum for example in the downtown area 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.370
 peninsular 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.920
 we leave it here and remind you that tomorrow 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:52.050
 Sunday follows the rainfall in the 

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.490
 third north and it will be a colder day in 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:56.270
 good part of spain that enjoy 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.270
