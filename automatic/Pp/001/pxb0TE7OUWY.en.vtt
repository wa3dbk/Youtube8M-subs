00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:07.050
 Hello Nakai from beauty 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:10.010
 The other day I was watching a magazine 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:12.040
 Is it a magazine of a piste 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:16.450
 At that time 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:19.550
 Go eyeliner to be drawn snugly from the tactics school in the mood to say to be the 40s 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:23.300
 It is I'm there is songs like Tteyuu not 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:30.050
 Certainly I think that there is ad 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:32.369
 I think that the impression of my eyes changes rapidly when I was young and I think that it is about r 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.520
 The two that were out for planning 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:42.570
 Cosmetics I also bought soon 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:44.720
 So I also want to tell everyone that it was actually how I tried it 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.470
 We are recording 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:50.910
 What do you use? 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:55.010
 Here is a cream shaper, it is one of Clinique's 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:57.630
 It is easy to write because it has some lame 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.460
 I like Naa no thick of the eye to the true 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:03.210
 Though it is gran school irra 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.210
 To tell the truth 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:13.570
 I also I I think you can use to take is mild hotkey That's polish this before 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:16.320
 I'm using something, but is this mild super sharp? 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.830
 Really no more macros 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.420
 Not attached to the lower mouth 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.970
 Black also black 9 colors 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.090
 Using this 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:27.970
 It is very fine even if the strike is easy, too 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:33.880
 is 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:37.750
 I'm not a dexterous person, but I can do that too , so everyone 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:44.820
 Steel frame eyes that I would like to have you naturally 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:50.400
 I have a left eye, I think I want to show how good the impression is different 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:51.720
 First of all it is how to pull the eyeliner later, but I put my hand on the cat a little more 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.740
 Though 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.369
 Hmm 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.369
 From the end 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.479
 Like this 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.420
 It is the last point of sex and dances 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.500
 Do you know I 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.500
 I laid it on the franc 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:25.069
 On top of this 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.490
 Super sharpener 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:30.100
 Better than this 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.730
 Or a place you've too have 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.140
 Wait the same 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:40.980
 There then 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.980
 Yes , there are many different ways to play the liner, but only the last one 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.750
 I too bad day 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.210
 Ah 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.360
 From peace white 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.490
 Toward the Meiji era 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:20.290
 Then I can see a little bit of what I just painted down below 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.600
 Then 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.530
 this 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.560
 The dark black sound line is a bit softer 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.250
 hermit 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.940
 You can see it, too black is too strong 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.360
 do you understand 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.030
 A calm cherry blossom 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:40.850
 If you do not put 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:45.200
 After all Yayoi eyes original sister store completely different also eye size 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:48.550
 You can see that it has changed country and each one and I 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.550
 I have a liner in it 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.780
 Even a year I wrote a little 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:55.630
 It is totally different 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:04:03.560
 It becomes like this 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:07.760
 Well because this about change also happy branch also varies by all means everyone's in 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:11.819
 It's so easy, just playing a line i don't even need to be a love 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:14.370
 It feels like it's going to be my or something bad 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:20.139
 So with this Japanese guy 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:24.389
 I hope you enjoy this woman's difference 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:24.389
