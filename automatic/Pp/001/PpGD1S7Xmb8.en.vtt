miss<00:01:49.920> so<00:01:50.310> I'm<00:01:50.399> going<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.790> describe<00:01:51.060> how<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.329> get

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
miss so I'm going to describe how to get

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.749 
miss so I'm going to describe how to get
those<00:01:51.840> first<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.680> then<00:01:53.070> I<00:01:53.100> will<00:01:53.369> describe<00:01:53.700> how

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
those first and then I will describe how

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.969 
those first and then I will describe how
to<00:01:53.970> easily<00:01:54.630> get<00:01:54.869> all<00:01:55.079> of<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.500> weapons<00:01:55.860> that

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
to easily get all of the weapons that

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.370 
to easily get all of the weapons that
spawn<00:01:56.520> randomly<00:01:56.820> so<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.509> first<00:01:57.780> two<00:01:57.960> weapons

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
spawn randomly so the first two weapons

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.789 
spawn randomly so the first two weapons
that<00:01:58.530> don't<00:01:58.770> spawn<00:01:59.130> are<00:01:59.520> the<00:02:00.420> drill<00:02:00.960> which<00:02:01.649> you

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799

umm<00:05:57.260> da<00:05:58.190> da<00:05:58.340> da<00:05:58.550> da<00:05:58.610> looks<00:05:59.180> like<00:05:59.330> it's<00:05:59.510> going<00:05:59.720> to

00:05:59.740 --> 00:05:59.750 
umm da da da da looks like it's going to

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:01.870 
umm da da da da looks like it's going to
be<00:05:59.900> a<00:05:59.930> ninja<00:06:00.500> star<00:06:00.560> and<00:06:01.130> a<00:06:01.340> double-barrel

be a ninja star and a double-barrel

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.850 
be a ninja star and a double-barrel
shotgun<00:06:01.910> and<00:06:02.690> if<00:06:02.990> you<00:06:03.080> don't<00:06:03.260> like<00:06:03.500> what

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:03.860 
shotgun and if you don't like what

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:05.230 
shotgun and if you don't like what
weapons<00:06:04.190> are<00:06:04.310> there<00:06:04.430> you<00:06:04.610> could<00:06:04.729> just<00:06:04.880> run<00:06:05.060> in

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:05.240 
weapons are there you could just run in

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.490 
weapons are there you could just run in
and<00:06:05.419> die<00:06:05.600> and<00:06:05.960> it<00:06:06.110> would<00:06:06.200> be<00:06:06.289> something

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:06.500 
and die and it would be something

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.159 
and die and it would be something
different<00:06:07.100> each<00:06:07.490> time<00:06:07.910> so<00:06:08.510> you<00:06:08.600> can<00:06:08.810> just<00:06:08.990> keep

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:09.169 
different each time so you can just keep

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:11.620 
different each time so you can just keep

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:38.320 
weapon spawns are also different and

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.870

randomized<00:06:39.320> now<00:06:39.740> I'm<00:06:39.860> not<00:06:40.070> going<00:06:40.340> to<00:06:40.640> record

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:51.260 
been long enough as it is but hopefully

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.860 
been long enough as it is but hopefully
I've<00:06:51.680> kept<00:06:51.920> it<00:06:52.040> brief<00:06:52.190> and<00:06:52.870> informative

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:53.870 
I've kept it brief and informative

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:55.880 
enough that I hope that made sense and

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.250 
enough that I hope that made sense and
with<00:06:55.970> the<00:06:56.060> checklist<00:06:56.480> you<00:06:56.750> should<00:06:56.900> be<00:06:57.020> able<00:06:57.200> to

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:57.260 
with the checklist you should be able to

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.020 
with the checklist you should be able to
check<00:06:57.440> off<00:06:57.650> every<00:06:58.010> single<00:06:58.310> weapon<00:06:58.460> obviously

00:06:59.020 --> 00:06:59.030 
check off every single weapon obviously

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:00.510

I've<00:06:59.210> already<00:06:59.510> gotten<00:06:59.660> the<00:06:59.840> for<00:07:00.020> trophies

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:00.520 
I've already gotten the for trophies

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:04.600 
I've already gotten the for trophies
myself<00:07:01.520> and<00:07:02.590> like<00:07:03.590> I<00:07:03.710> said<00:07:03.770> just<00:07:04.100> make<00:07:04.370> sure

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:04.610 
myself and like I said just make sure

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:07.000 
myself and like I said just make sure
that<00:07:04.640> once<00:07:05.600> you<00:07:05.780> use<00:07:05.810> them<00:07:06.320> you<00:07:06.590> don't<00:07:06.800> check

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:07.010 
that once you use them you don't check

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:08.830 
that once you use them you don't check
it<00:07:07.190> off<00:07:07.340> unless<00:07:07.640> you<00:07:07.880> complete<00:07:08.570> that

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:08.840 
it off unless you complete that

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:12.190

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:12.200 
particular checkpoint and that way the

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.200 
particular checkpoint and that way the
game<00:07:12.380> will<00:07:12.560> save<00:07:12.770> the<00:07:12.980> fact<00:07:13.250> that<00:07:13.370> you<00:07:13.730> use<00:07:13.970> it

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:14.210 
game will save the fact that you use it

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:16.690
