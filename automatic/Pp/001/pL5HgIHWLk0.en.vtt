00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.289
 hello good evening everyone is soussou 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.970
 how are you and the taste of the months 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.310
 it's okay friends we find ourselves 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.890
 today for a new video on 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.660
 a call of duty black ops in match mode 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.580
 to death by team on the map nothing 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.260
 hate I like in this video I'm going 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.930
 play with as a main dish lake 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.320
 the a47 a weapon here I have rather 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.570
 well 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.820
 and in this video you will see that 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.710
 the game will go pretty well and I 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.570
 will finish on a 31 of ratio 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.670
 could more accurate thirty-one 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.170
 eliminating not one death for you 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.420
 to say how much the party has rather 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.610
 well done even if I have to confess 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.829
 I will even do a lot of elimination 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.989
 with my dogs the size and mollard 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.570
 Liked but good in general 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.820
 the game went pretty well 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.680
 less I find it otherwise in the video 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.539
 we will do today just a little 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.700
 debate which I hope obviously we will you 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.890
 like a little debate here is normal 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.750
 quietly put me down 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.430
 in front of my little microphone and I hope 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.920
 just that you too are well 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.210
 asked and in this video as I you 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.710
 it's going to be a little debate 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.200
 really super happy sages give well 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.060
 to confess let's say that what is happier 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.630
 and it'll be more comments space 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.939
 video since you really need to really 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.259
 chat with me there is akÃ§am so it's 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.880
 really you now to tell me a 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.470
 little what you think 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.180
 compared to what I'm going to tell you 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.009
 after in the commentary space of the 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.220
 video so today we're going 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.259
 just talked about a potential break 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.680
 of a peace stats just to see a 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.810
 a bit 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.550
 what are the people who are for 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.440
 and count but also 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.760
 to have your arguments and now 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.670
 it's really you telling me what 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.680
 are your arguments for a ps4 break and 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.720
 what are your arguments account a ps4 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.970
 I broke in this video monks and 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.860
 alright i'll just give you my 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.800
 arguments a personal month so for 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.330
 to begin you must know that me to givet 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.270
 going finally I'm going to have just 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.620
 a single argument by category for you 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.869
 to say how true it is 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.130
 but I really sought I did not 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.110
 found so I really tell you 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.500
 simply if they do not go to the 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.420
 head 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.060
 so I must know that I am 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.760
 really a person who likes 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.480
 change the game simply on ps3 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.130
 I do it 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.380
 I would also like to do on pc 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.600
 theater this is also filing having 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.210
 small fashion like a little speedway is 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.010
 a little game ben really simply 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.520
 to have fun for fun all 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.960
 simply 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.600
 but it's not possible yet 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.250
 since there is no pesca jailbreak or 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.570
 can not change the thresholds for the 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.460
 to do in campaign mode for the moment 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.740
 so for the moment it's not 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.150
 really possible and that's really the 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.010
 solar of the world I am here me 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.690
 I would really like to change 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.800
 some games on pc head but for 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.530
 the art of the month they listen to now 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.300
 it's really the fact that here I am 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.910
 am really a ps4 player since 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.680
 debut that the outputs is really 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.300
 from the beginning she came out I 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.490
 can admit even when I 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.810
 really tried 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:06.050
 to see a little bit about that 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.180
 would look like for example for call of 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.130
 duty on ps3 but I went there 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.020
 also and I really guarantee you 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.440
 had at the time about a year ago kid 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:17.390
 was really not the same since 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.740
 with fashions and without words it's not about 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.930
 column same thing and frankly I 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.430
 really great fun to me of course 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.870
 call of duty now since there is 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.000
 no radar everyone is really 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.830
 the same is really his level that is 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.300
 happy so it's a little bit for that 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.100
 that I like and it's really art 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.450
 of the mans who's against for me what 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.850
 would be good for me what would 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.800
 perfect i will be actually a ps3 gibret 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.000
 coming out but there is a small 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.410
 problem finally not really a small 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.780
 problem but that there is no more 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.340
 rescue or something like that 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.220
 will actually play online 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:49.370
 and if there is a ps4 jailbreak coming out in 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.900
 update it's true we will say 1.50 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.510
 or less points in 70 what is 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.220
 really not the last and well I 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.320
 you say it's done sk I'll buy it 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.740
 limit you dry is not really a 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:03.290
 normal ps4 and I blame him for me 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:05.030
 finally I will have the age to house earlier by 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.780

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.640
