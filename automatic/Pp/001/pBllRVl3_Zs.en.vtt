floor maybe or it doesn't get monitor
it's<00:03:32.049> just<00:03:32.579> some<00:03:33.579> kind<00:03:33.790> of<00:03:33.910> technology<00:03:34.540> don't

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
it's just some kind of technology don't

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:44.839 
it's just some kind of technology don't
