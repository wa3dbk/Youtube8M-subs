through<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:02.910> telescope<00:01:03.270> lens<00:01:03.690> so<00:01:03.989> we<00:01:04.110> zoomed<00:01:04.379> in

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
through a telescope lens so we zoomed in

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.039 
through a telescope lens so we zoomed in
and<00:01:04.890> we<00:01:04.949> slowed<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.280> down<00:01:05.460> as<00:01:06.450> soon<00:01:06.630> as<00:01:06.750> I<00:01:06.869> put

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
and we slowed it down as soon as I put

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.260 
and we slowed it down as soon as I put
the<00:01:07.170> camera<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.710> telescope<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.729> just<00:01:09.030> blew
