demonstrating<00:01:31.810> the<00:01:31.900> power<00:01:32.110> of<00:01:32.500> the<00:01:32.640> 497

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
demonstrating the power of the 497

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.700 
demonstrating the power of the 497
process<00:01:34.120> or<00:01:34.240> single<00:01:34.870> little<00:01:35.050> wafer

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.860 

in<00:01:39.710> a<00:01:39.770> smooth<00:01:40.160> this<00:01:40.370> rendering<00:01:40.880> as<00:01:41.210> you<00:01:41.390> can<00:01:41.600> as

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:41.870 
in a smooth this rendering as you can as

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.100 
in a smooth this rendering as you can as
you<00:01:41.990> can<00:01:42.140> imagine<00:01:42.350> i'll<00:01:42.710> actually<00:01:42.920> zoom<00:01:43.370> is<00:01:43.670> in

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
you can imagine i'll actually zoom is in

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.630 
you can imagine i'll actually zoom is in
so<00:01:45.110> you're<00:01:45.230> running<00:01:45.500> it<00:01:45.590> off<00:01:45.740> this<00:01:45.920> one<00:01:46.190> i<00:01:46.370> am

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
so you're running it off this one i am

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.580 
so you're running it off this one i am
yeah<00:01:46.850> yeah<00:01:47.240> yeah<00:01:47.630> you<00:01:48.020> can<00:01:48.170> see<00:01:48.320> that<00:01:48.350> I've

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
yeah yeah yeah you can see that I've

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.170 
yeah yeah yeah you can see that I've
assumed<00:01:48.890> and<00:01:49.250> all<00:01:49.400> the<00:01:49.490> cube<00:01:49.760> so<00:01:49.910> now<00:01:50.030> we<00:01:50.090> have

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
assumed and all the cube so now we have

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.740 
assumed and all the cube so now we have
a<00:01:50.270> lot<00:01:50.510> less<00:01:50.750> than<00:01:50.990> 500<00:01:51.260> cubes<00:01:51.830> here<00:01:52.690> I'll<00:01:53.690> zoom

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
a lot less than 500 cubes here I'll zoom

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.870 
a lot less than 500 cubes here I'll zoom
back<00:01:54.170> out<00:01:54.410> again<00:01:54.620> you<00:01:55.010> can<00:01:55.160> see<00:01:55.370> how<00:01:55.520> smooth

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
back out again you can see how smooth

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.490 
back out again you can see how smooth
the<00:01:56.060> rendering<00:01:56.540> with<00:01:56.720> bangs<00:01:59.110> how<00:02:00.110> cool<00:02:00.320> is

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
the rendering with bangs how cool is

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.100 
the rendering with bangs how cool is
that<00:02:00.530> I<00:02:01.870> can<00:02:02.870> change<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:03.380> hatch

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
that I can change the hatch

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.270 
that I can change the hatch
it's<00:02:06.110> just<00:02:06.320> an<00:02:06.409> example<00:02:06.560> of<00:02:07.010> an<00:02:07.159> application

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
it's just an example of an application

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.620 
it's just an example of an application
that<00:02:08.270> was<00:02:08.959> developed<00:02:09.500> for<00:02:09.740> us<00:02:09.979> for<00:02:10.340> CES<00:02:10.880> to

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
that was developed for us for CES to

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.630 
that was developed for us for CES to
really<00:02:11.840> demonstrate<00:02:12.050> how<00:02:12.620> information<00:02:13.040> could

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
really demonstrate how information could

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.380 
really demonstrate how information could
be<00:02:13.700> accessed<00:02:14.300> in<00:02:14.450> the<00:02:14.600> future<00:02:16.000> which<00:02:17.000> part<00:02:17.300> of

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
be accessed in the future which part of

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.260 
be accessed in the future which part of
inter<00:02:17.720> research<00:02:18.170> in<00:02:18.380> action

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:28.160

amazing up so what it was the actual

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.830 
amazing up so what it was the actual
display<00:03:20.530> but<00:03:21.430> the<00:03:21.640> displays<00:03:22.030> an<00:03:22.270> optical

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
display but the displays an optical

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.290 
display but the displays an optical
touch<00:03:23.110> it's<00:03:23.560> double<00:03:24.130> high<00:03:24.310> definition<00:03:25.120> so

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
touch it's double high definition so

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.220 
touch it's double high definition so
it's<00:03:25.450> 1920<00:03:26.170> x<00:03:26.290> 1920<00:03:26.740> so<00:03:27.490> there's<00:03:27.700> a<00:03:27.760> career

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
it's 1920 x 1920 so there's a career

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.990 
it's 1920 x 1920 so there's a career
rear<00:03:29.230> projection<00:03:29.620> yep<00:03:30.130> exactly<00:03:30.400> right<00:03:30.760> and

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
rear projection yep exactly right and

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.610 
rear projection yep exactly right and
it's<00:03:31.360> a<00:03:31.480> touch<00:03:31.720> panel<00:03:32.080> it<00:03:32.560> is<00:03:32.830> optical<00:03:33.550> touch

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
it's a touch panel it is optical touch

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.840 
it's a touch panel it is optical touch
yeah<00:03:35.620> you<00:03:35.680> can<00:03:35.920> always<00:03:36.130> say<00:03:36.370> the<00:03:36.520> local
