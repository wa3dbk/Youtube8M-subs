00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
I carry well actually I think I'm

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.380 
I carry well actually I think I'm
carrying<00:00:03.449> too<00:00:03.899> much<00:00:04.460> high<00:00:05.460> explosive<00:00:06.150> because

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
carrying too much high explosive because

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.330 
carrying too much high explosive because
I<00:00:06.569> don't<00:00:06.720> use<00:00:06.930> high<00:00:07.140> explosive<00:00:07.620> that<00:00:07.770> often<00:00:08.160> I

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
I don't use high explosive that often I

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.310 
I don't use high explosive that often I
only<00:00:08.910> typically<00:00:09.540> use<00:00:09.750> that<00:00:09.990> when<00:00:10.230> I'm

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
only typically use that when I'm

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.959 
only typically use that when I'm
shooting<00:00:10.650> from<00:00:10.769> really<00:00:11.040> far<00:00:11.309> away<00:00:11.429> and<00:00:11.880> I'm

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
shooting from really far away and I'm

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.450 
shooting from really far away and I'm
shooting<00:00:12.090> at<00:00:12.300> white<00:00:12.480> tanks<00:00:13.049> all<00:00:13.230> right<00:00:13.380> I<00:00:13.710> am

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460

shooting at white tanks all right I am
you<00:00:15.389> know<00:00:15.509> shooting<00:00:15.809> at<00:00:17.210> artillery<00:00:18.320> because

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
you know shooting at artillery because

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.230 
you know shooting at artillery because
you<00:00:19.529> can<00:00:19.650> get<00:00:19.710> an<00:00:19.830> explosive<00:00:20.220> area<00:00:20.730> with<00:00:20.939> that

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
you can get an explosive area with that

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.529 
you can get an explosive area with that
that<00:00:21.689> that<00:00:22.560> can<00:00:22.890> encompass<00:00:23.279> even<00:00:24.060> if<00:00:24.180> you<00:00:24.300> miss

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
that that can encompass even if you miss

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.150 
that that can encompass even if you miss
a<00:00:24.570> little<00:00:24.840> bit<00:00:25.080> you<00:00:25.230> can<00:00:25.380> do<00:00:25.500> damage<00:00:25.769> to<00:00:25.920> them

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
a little bit you can do damage to them

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.529 
a little bit you can do damage to them
and<00:00:26.250> sometimes<00:00:26.400> even<00:00:26.760> knock<00:00:27.060> him<00:00:27.240> out<00:00:27.359> and

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
and sometimes even knock him out and

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.439 
and sometimes even knock him out and
even<00:00:27.630> without<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:27.990> direct<00:00:28.349> hit<00:00:29.210> but<00:00:30.210> the

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
even without a direct hit but the

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.229 
even without a direct hit but the
armor-piercing<00:00:30.929> rounds

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
armor-piercing rounds

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:35.540 
armor-piercing rounds
those<00:00:33.239> ones<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:33.840> typically<00:00:34.500> need<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:34.920> hit<00:00:35.280> in

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
those ones you typically need a hit in

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.720 
those ones you typically need a hit in
order<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.239> score<00:00:36.989> any<00:00:37.079> damage<00:00:37.530> so<00:00:37.739> what<00:00:38.610> you

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
order to score any damage so what you

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.880 
order to score any damage so what you
notice<00:00:38.879> I<00:00:39.090> did<00:00:39.300> here<00:00:39.510> is<00:00:39.570> I<00:00:39.660> just<00:00:39.690> dragged<00:00:40.260> the

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
notice I did here is I just dragged the

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.970 
notice I did here is I just dragged the
bar<00:00:41.360> so<00:00:42.360> it<00:00:42.480> was<00:00:42.570> up<00:00:42.719> here<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.260> I<00:00:43.290> just<00:00:43.320> drag<00:00:43.800> it

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
bar so it was up here and I just drag it

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.369 
bar so it was up here and I just drag it
down<00:00:44.190> here<00:00:44.700> so<00:00:45.420> that<00:00:45.690> when<00:00:45.989> I<00:00:46.020> hit<00:00:46.079> on<00:00:46.230> a

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
down here so that when I hit on a

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.040 
down here so that when I hit on a
resupply<00:00:46.860> it's<00:00:47.550> only<00:00:47.789> gonna<00:00:47.969> give<00:00:48.239> me<00:00:48.510> let's

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
resupply it's only gonna give me let's

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.959 
resupply it's only gonna give me let's
say<00:00:49.260> eight<00:00:49.500> rounds<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:50.190> don't<00:00:50.640> use<00:00:50.789> it<00:00:50.940> that

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
say eight rounds I don't use it that

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.450 
say eight rounds I don't use it that
much<00:00:51.120> so<00:00:51.719> I<00:00:51.989> don't<00:00:52.050> need<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.500> many<00:00:52.649> now<00:00:53.399> I

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
much so I don't need that many now I

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.470 
much so I don't need that many now I
want<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:53.910> move<00:00:54.059> up<00:00:54.350> this<00:00:55.350> one<00:00:55.620> right<00:00:55.770> here<00:00:56.129> and

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
want to move up this one right here and

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.270 
want to move up this one right here and
so<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.899> armor-piercing<00:00:58.289> I'll<00:00:58.949> be<00:00:59.070> up<00:00:59.160> to

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
so the armor-piercing I'll be up to

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.729 
so the armor-piercing I'll be up to
thirty<00:00:59.520> two<00:00:59.760> rounds<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.480> I<00:01:01.260> can<00:01:01.410> carry<00:01:01.649> a

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.870 
total of 42 rounds on this particular
tank<00:01:05.070> now<00:01:06.060> if<00:01:06.299> I<00:01:06.420> wanted<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:07.130> say<00:01:08.130> carry<00:01:08.610> some

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880

tank now if I wanted to say carry some
of<00:01:09.000> these<00:01:09.060> rounds<00:01:09.479> for<00:01:09.689> gold

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
of these rounds for gold

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.289 
of these rounds for gold
I'd<00:01:10.530> have<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:11.010> lower<00:01:11.220> one<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.640> these<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:12.150> give

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
I'd have to lower one of these to give

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.210 
I'd have to lower one of these to give
it<00:01:12.390> availability<00:01:12.960> see<00:01:13.170> this<00:01:13.320> is<00:01:13.470> this<00:01:13.619> extra

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
it availability see this is this extra

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.730 
it availability see this is this extra
gray<00:01:14.460> line<00:01:14.700> here<00:01:14.970> is<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.090> availability<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:16.140> I

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
gray line here is the availability and I

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.550 
gray line here is the availability and I
could<00:01:16.950> do<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.460> this<00:01:17.610> way<00:01:17.850> now<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.540> don't<00:01:19.080> want<00:01:19.470> to

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
could do it this way now I don't want to

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.550 
could do it this way now I don't want to
spend<00:01:19.799> gold<00:01:20.100> on<00:01:20.520> rounds<00:01:21.030> especially<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:22.439> know

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
spend gold on rounds especially you know

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.210 
spend gold on rounds especially you know
ten<00:01:22.950> ten<00:01:23.939> gold<00:01:24.270> let's<00:01:24.630> see

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
ten ten gold let's see

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.179 
ten ten gold let's see
ten<00:01:26.220> dollars<00:01:26.580> equals<00:01:26.970> 2500<00:01:27.420> gold<00:01:27.840> so<00:01:28.259> one

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
ten dollars equals 2500 gold so one

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.469 
ten dollars equals 2500 gold so one
dollar<00:01:29.400> would<00:01:29.640> equal<00:01:29.880> 250<00:01:30.689> gold<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.400> so<00:01:32.479> it

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
dollar would equal 250 gold and so it

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.789 
dollar would equal 250 gold and so it
would<00:01:33.689> cost<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:34.290> for<00:01:35.119> 25<00:01:36.119> shots<00:01:36.540> would<00:01:37.290> be<00:01:37.530> a

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
would cost you for 25 shots would be a

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.940 
would cost you for 25 shots would be a
dollar<00:01:38.180> so<00:01:39.180> they<00:01:39.869> are<00:01:40.049> about<00:01:40.229> four<00:01:40.290> cents<00:01:40.740> each

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
dollar so they are about four cents each

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.889 
dollar so they are about four cents each
and<00:01:42.920> that's<00:01:43.920> you<00:01:44.850> know<00:01:44.880> I<00:01:45.180> wouldn't<00:01:45.630> want<00:01:45.810> to

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
and that's you know I wouldn't want to

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.190 
and that's you know I wouldn't want to
do<00:01:46.049> that<00:01:46.229> unless<00:01:46.409> I<00:01:46.829> was<00:01:46.920> in<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.670> competition<00:01:48.299> to

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
do that unless I was in a competition to

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.539 
do that unless I was in a competition to
where<00:01:49.409> I<00:01:49.439> am<00:01:50.689> actually<00:01:51.740> you<00:01:52.740> know<00:01:52.860> trying<00:01:53.430> to

compete for you know ladder rankings or
whatnot<00:01:56.189> then<00:01:56.909> I<00:01:57.270> would<00:01:57.630> go

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
whatnot then I would go

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.940 
whatnot then I would go
