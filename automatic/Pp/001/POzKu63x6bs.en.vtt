00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:18.449
 hi this is rades punt and I missed 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.680
 come back this is it's christmas and I have a 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.630
 his pen 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:26.760
 so we put ourselves in the atmosphere boosted 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:29.310
 missed or not I come to talk to you you 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:34.370
 doubted because last night it was on 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:37.110
 my blog cleans it 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.960
 so yes I cracked for the year tier 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.360
 iii i was going to buy source sephora.fr 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.059
 or when there was a species of 2 the 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.350
 exit buzz in preview and in 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.750
 most important of which I had less 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.090
 I was very happy with myself here is the 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.760
 stupid I think you've already seen 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.399
 reviewed and reviewed so I'm not going 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.020
 detail knowing that by going to my house 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.239
 blog you will find pictures of 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.949
 swatch I think it says all keelboat 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.989
 which is rather positive of course even if 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.700
 I do not understand how urbanczyk 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.979
 effect to create works 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.340
 like that I still do not understand what 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:14.159
 finally here it is but in any case it is a 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.659
 palette that kills the colors are 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.700
 beautiful so we're really in 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.920
 romantic tones in pink tones 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.020
 a little bad even the colors 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.110
 Dark neutrons in tent 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.810
 purplish and that's it the little 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.270
 difference from this palette I like 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.409
 sure the year which of love but this one 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.990
 it's his little sister so here I am 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:40.200
 hyper happy so I realized you 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.810
 a very simple little makeup with I 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.570
 shows you that a bit closer so 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.130
 it's very very very very simple 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.369
 sun is here today so we are 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.259
 happy but it's not ultra perfect at 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.210
 level of sun orientation but 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.990
 we're not going too much too much 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.909
 complain do not pay attention to the state 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.850
 of my skin that right now we decided 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.400
 to make a little bit of it at its head and that's 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.120
 foot 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:11.020
 on twitter know that perron kg 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:13.120
 contains vitamins b12 and b6 gives 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.350
 pimples in some people and 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.160
 me that's what happened so in 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.140
 anyway all the good shots 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.580
 vitaminized foods includes one is 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.650
 in winter be careful what there is 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.710
 in because it can destroy your 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.110
 skin and I have trouble recovering on this 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.910
 if you want to know everything how I have 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.210
 do well I'll let you watch the 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.770
 after 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.910
 so I was young my base and we're going 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.740
 go on the eyeshadow 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.740
 beautiful palette 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.810
 I take a brush ranked 239 of 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:41.260
 mac with the beautiful hue that is 2 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:51.100
 this pink pretty iridescent and especially well 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:54.820
 lights and one side of the julien brush 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:58.630
 dray m be the inner half of my 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:01.420
 eye next with the other half of my 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.610
 brush I'm going to take the york 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.450
 the right here and that's a little bit more 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.450
 in purple tones 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.510
 then with 1 217 of mac I will come 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:18.310
 take on the theme that is limit 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.519
 and I want to come and glean teeth 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.519
 hollow 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.569
 always with the same 217 I will come 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.310
 take nooner who so this hue 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:31.659
 mate too is no longer dark I'm going 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:38.290
 come put in hollow but rather to 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:39.370
 outside with a beveled brush I 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.440
 come learn the trend the most 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.440
 darkness of the palette which is this 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:48.430
 beautiful plum with glitter 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:50.410
 almost black called black rate on 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:54.250
 be very careful about falling on the one 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:04:00.180
 there and I'm going to come and make a line of 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:00.180
 liner with this hue 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.170
 that third parties 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:19.329
 and then we just float with a 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:27.910
 brush so that the line is not visible 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:30.810
 plus as much I will come to perfect the de 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:34.270
 eyebrows with this beige hue 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:36.990
 colors for whom it always sins with 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.990
 the second set 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.960
 a Belgian a little pink but that's all 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.880
 well enough I will turn with Belgian 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.460
 a tiny one by his pencil take 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:52.270
 this beautiful hue which is called 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:56.160
 ski and a very high light pink and I 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.160
 come all in inner corner 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.590
 then I come to tour at it 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.810
 always with this little brush and 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:08.169
 the magnificent reach world would have here 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:10.770
 which is called slap and we do all the 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:10.770
 26 the nec 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.580
 I like is a nude pencil in the 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:18.520
 mucosa which is the scandal as colors 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:23.099
 and or rimmel who is very very good 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.099
 and who costs 3 euros on asos 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:35.870
 so never macao and that's it for the 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:37.910
 eyes we will then move on to the rest of the 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:43.370
 face and on the cheeks I'm going to use 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:45.770
 a novelty a little bit of 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:47.930
 heart of the moment and this little palette 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:51.230
 of his little ones where there are several of 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:52.580
 their convertible cream blush that 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:54.560
 not expensive at all go surf 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:57.050
 the only around 25 euros 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.670
 so here I was expecting blushes 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.020
 really very well these songs that everything 

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:01.490
 the world says we say a lot of good I 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.200
 will do anyway an article on 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.640
 my blog very soon on it 

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.680
 as soon as you get my opinion but I am 

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.910
 a little bit disappointed with me I'm going 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.270
 take that peach color that is at 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:15.320
 middle and that's very light I'm going there 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:22.280
 go with your fingers and jeans but by 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:24.500
 little touches and I fund the rendering is 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:27.320
 still pretty nice but I 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:31.790
 think it can still make 

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:32.980
 small traces so here is a good 

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:34.760
 work 

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:36.200
 then I take the shade a little 

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:38.600
 little using the valette which is 

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:42.100
 keaton and so here it really is 

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.100
 really a very very very pretty hue 

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:49.100
 it does not do that much 

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:51.500
 it's super bright on the lips in 

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:53.960
 this moment my big darling is 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:56.870
 the cruel to nars who is a math a 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:07:02.210
 matte pencil that I got in this 

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:05.210
 small kit always 1st kyu a fury 

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:07.910
 so it's a red that's pretty 

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:09.890
 dark and dull but I think it's 

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:11.120
 is serious but it's not because I 

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:13.570
 had to re on the eyes this program is hard 

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.570
 at the chalet m 

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:27.789
 even if this mata does not dry out 

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:29.860
 completely lips that's it's over 

00:07:27.789 --> 00:07:33.520
 so I hope this little wedding with 

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:35.199
 the beautiful nick 3 you will have liked 

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:37.930
 do not worry there will be 

00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:41.160
 others and I hope you like 

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:41.160
 world is waiting for it
