00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
I actually took off the seat and took

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.400 
I actually took off the seat and took
off<00:00:28.609> the<00:00:28.789> tank<00:00:29.060> since<00:00:29.330> I'll<00:00:29.449> just<00:00:29.570> be<00:00:29.750> changing

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
off the tank since I'll just be changing

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.470 
off the tank since I'll just be changing
it<00:00:30.470> out<00:00:30.560> for<00:00:30.740> the<00:00:30.800> Clarke<00:00:31.039> anyway<00:00:31.400> so<00:00:32.000> it<00:00:32.330> makes

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
it out for the Clarke anyway so it makes

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.720 
it out for the Clarke anyway so it makes
it<00:00:32.629> a<00:00:32.660> little<00:00:32.780> bit<00:00:32.960> easier<00:00:33.260> to<00:00:33.320> get<00:00:33.559> to<00:00:33.739> to<00:00:34.580> the

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
it a little bit easier to get to to the

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.700 
it a little bit easier to get to to the
different<00:00:35.030> pieces<00:00:35.260> especially<00:00:36.260> the<00:00:36.559> little

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
different pieces especially the little

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.969 
different pieces especially the little
separators<00:00:37.250> so<00:00:37.780> what<00:00:38.780> we<00:00:38.900> have<00:00:39.110> is<00:00:39.440> this<00:00:39.860> is

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:39.979 
separators so what we have is this is

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:41.680 
separators so what we have is this is
the<00:00:40.100> charcoal<00:00:40.400> canister<00:00:40.640> in<00:00:41.089> the<00:00:41.299> IMS

this hose goes to the gas cap this one

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.590 
this hose goes to the gas cap this one
goes<00:01:30.109> to<00:01:30.530> the<00:01:30.950> diaphragm<00:01:31.460> this<00:01:32.090> middle<00:01:32.450> one

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
goes to the diaphragm this middle one

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.359 
goes to the diaphragm this middle one
that<00:01:32.749> comes<00:01:32.960> up<00:01:33.109> from<00:01:33.259> the<00:01:33.319> bottom<00:01:33.560> that<00:01:34.189> just

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
that comes up from the bottom that just

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:36.160 
that comes up from the bottom that just
fence<00:01:34.549> to<00:01:34.729> the<00:01:34.819> side<00:01:34.999> of<00:01:35.090> the<00:01:35.149> engine<00:01:35.479> and<00:01:35.659> the

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
fence to the side of the engine and the

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.289 
fence to the side of the engine and the
lower<00:01:36.350> one<00:01:36.560> here<00:01:36.799> just<00:01:37.009> goes<00:01:37.189> down<00:01:37.939> to<00:01:38.210> the

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
lower one here just goes down to the

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:39.580 
lower one here just goes down to the
frame<00:01:38.539> right<00:01:38.780> here<00:01:38.929> and<00:01:39.020> dispense<00:01:39.319> out<00:01:39.469> the

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
frame right here and dispense out the

00:01:39.590 --> 00:02:05.300 
frame right here and dispense out the
bottom

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.880 

since<00:02:05.940> these<00:02:06.090> 12<00:02:06.390> mil<00:02:06.570> bolts<00:02:06.900> are<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.380> engine

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
since these 12 mil bolts are the engine

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.440 
since these 12 mil bolts are the engine
mount<00:02:08.100> bolts<00:02:08.399> you<00:02:08.850> want<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.090> tighten<00:02:09.360> those

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
mount bolts you want to tighten those

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:16.059 
mount bolts you want to tighten those
back<00:02:09.690> down<00:02:09.929> right<00:02:10.140> away

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.350 

so<00:02:17.069> once<00:02:17.280> you've<00:02:17.430> removed<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.880> charcoal

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
so once you've removed the charcoal

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.840 
so once you've removed the charcoal
canister<00:02:18.569> you<00:02:19.020> can<00:02:19.950> start<00:02:20.220> by<00:02:20.370> taking<00:02:20.520> and

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
canister you can start by taking and

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.550 
canister you can start by taking and
start<00:02:21.030> taking<00:02:21.120> off<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.480> hoses

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.100 

this<00:02:25.130> is<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.400> first<00:02:25.670> one<00:02:25.910> and<00:02:26.270> here's<00:02:27.050> the

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
this is the first one and here's the

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:35.440 
this is the first one and here's the
second<00:02:27.560> one<00:02:27.680> on<00:02:27.830> the<00:02:27.920> right<00:02:28.099> side<00:02:34.209> and<00:02:35.209> now<00:02:35.390> you

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
second one on the right side and now you

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.870 
second one on the right side and now you
can<00:02:35.660> move<00:02:35.810> on<00:02:35.989> to<00:02:36.170> taking<00:02:36.770> off<00:02:36.890> these<00:02:37.130> two<00:02:37.489> 10

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
can move on to taking off these two 10

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.660 
can move on to taking off these two 10
mil<00:02:38.120> nuts<00:02:38.630> right<00:02:38.870> here

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.460 

and<00:02:44.240> the<00:02:44.390> whole<00:02:44.540> piece<00:02:44.780> should<00:02:44.960> come<00:02:45.230> right

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
and the whole piece should come right

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.110 
and the whole piece should come right
off

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:56.110 

with<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:48.900> hoses<00:02:49.080> right<00:02:49.410> there

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.619 

you<00:02:56.239> can<00:02:56.390> move<00:02:56.569> that<00:02:56.750> out<00:02:56.810> of<00:02:56.989> the<00:02:57.110> way<00:02:57.290> for<00:02:57.560> now

00:02:58.619 --> 00:02:58.629 
you can move that out of the way for now

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:01.690 
you can move that out of the way for now
and<00:02:59.629> you<00:03:00.170> can<00:03:00.319> take<00:03:00.530> off<00:03:00.739> these<00:03:00.950> two<00:03:00.980> 10<00:03:01.400> mils

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
and you can take off these two 10 mils

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.649 
and you can take off these two 10 mils
right<00:03:01.940> here<00:03:03.819> and<00:03:04.819> then<00:03:05.000> take<00:03:05.209> that<00:03:05.390> whole

00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:05.659 
right here and then take that whole

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:08.100 
right here and then take that whole
bracket<00:03:05.900> off<00:03:06.170> and<00:03:06.980> I'll<00:03:07.099> probably<00:03:07.310> get<00:03:07.580> some

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
bracket off and I'll probably get some

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.470 
bracket off and I'll probably get some
probably<00:03:09.110> get<00:03:09.200> some<00:03:09.319> shorter<00:03:09.650> bolts<00:03:09.980> for<00:03:10.190> here

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
probably get some shorter bolts for here

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.910 
probably get some shorter bolts for here
two<00:03:11.480> of<00:03:11.629> these<00:03:11.750> bolts<00:03:12.080> just<00:03:12.440> so<00:03:12.590> that<00:03:12.769> I<00:03:12.799> can

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
two of these bolts just so that I can

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.440 
two of these bolts just so that I can
fill<00:03:13.190> up<00:03:13.280> the<00:03:13.310> holes<00:03:13.549> for<00:03:13.790> now<00:03:13.909> just<00:03:14.180> so<00:03:14.299> no

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
fill up the holes for now just so no

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:15.850 
fill up the holes for now just so no
gunk<00:03:14.690> gets<00:03:14.870> in<00:03:15.019> there<00:03:15.170> just<00:03:15.260> in<00:03:15.379> case<00:03:15.440> of<00:03:15.739> one

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
gunk gets in there just in case of one

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.740 
gunk gets in there just in case of one

honda<00:03:28.099> bond<00:03:28.250> on<00:03:28.489> there<00:03:28.700> just<00:03:29.629> so<00:03:29.750> that<00:03:30.019> it<00:03:30.140> has

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
honda bond on there just so that it has

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.800 
honda bond on there just so that it has
a<00:03:30.290> good<00:03:30.560> seal<00:03:30.859> so<00:03:31.280> don't<00:03:31.879> use<00:03:32.030> too<00:03:32.239> much<00:03:32.269> just

enough<00:03:32.959> like<00:03:33.410> a<00:03:33.500> thin<00:03:33.709> layer<00:03:33.890> to<00:03:34.310> just<00:03:35.000> make

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:35.329 
enough like a thin layer to just make

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:37.180 
enough like a thin layer to just make
sure<00:03:35.480> it's<00:03:35.629> sealed<00:03:35.859> you<00:03:36.859> don't<00:03:37.010> want<00:03:37.129> the

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
sure it's sealed you don't want the

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:51.830 
sure it's sealed you don't want the
stuff

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
the plug for the lower sections that I

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.950 
the plug for the lower sections that I
found<00:04:51.340> it<00:04:51.490> easier<00:04:51.789> to<00:04:52.030> take<00:04:52.509> out<00:04:52.629> the<00:04:52.750> little

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
found it easier to take out the little

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.110 
found it easier to take out the little
plastic<00:04:53.139> fitting<00:04:53.650> that<00:04:53.740> was<00:04:53.889> in<00:04:54.009> here<00:04:54.220> and

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
plastic fitting that was in here and

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.999 
plastic fitting that was in here and
then<00:04:55.300> just<00:04:55.539> actually<00:04:55.720> just<00:04:55.990> work<00:04:56.379> this<00:04:56.740> piece

00:04:56.999 --> 00:04:57.009 
then just actually just work this piece

00:04:57.009 --> 00:04:59.490 
then just actually just work this piece
into<00:04:57.250> here<00:04:57.610> and<00:04:57.789> then<00:04:58.599> just<00:04:58.780> reinstall<00:04:59.349> the

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
into here and then just reinstall the

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:16.900 
into here and then just reinstall the
plastic<00:04:59.919> piece<00:05:00.069> when<00:05:00.310> you're<00:05:00.430> done

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:19.030 

and<00:05:17.330> then<00:05:17.600> the<00:05:17.750> other<00:05:17.840> small<00:05:18.170> hose<00:05:18.440> I'm

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.040 
and then the other small hose I'm

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.620 
and then the other small hose I'm
actually<00:05:19.190> just<00:05:19.370> going<00:05:19.520> to<00:05:19.610> pull<00:05:19.850> it<00:05:19.970> off<00:05:20.090> here

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630 
actually just going to pull it off here

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:27.370 
actually just going to pull it off here
and<00:05:22.300> you<00:05:23.300> can<00:05:23.480> just<00:05:23.750> follow<00:05:24.470> it<00:05:24.740> up<00:05:26.170> and<00:05:27.170> it

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380 
and you can just follow it up and it

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:38.200 
and you can just follow it up and it
goes<00:05:27.560> up<00:05:27.830> to<00:05:29.230> this<00:05:30.230> tee<00:05:30.710> right<00:05:31.040> here

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.210 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:44.640 

so<00:05:38.750> you<00:05:38.840> can<00:05:38.960> just<00:05:39.110> pull<00:05:39.320> it<00:05:39.350> off<00:05:39.590> the<00:05:39.860> tee<00:05:40.130> and

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.870 

that's<00:05:45.650> what<00:05:45.800> you<00:05:45.919> have<00:05:46.100> left<00:05:46.400> right<00:05:46.610> there

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:46.880 
that's what you have left right there

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.480 
that's what you have left right there
you<00:05:47.750> can<00:05:47.870> just<00:05:47.960> put<00:05:48.259> one<00:05:48.560> of<00:05:48.680> the<00:05:48.800> rubber<00:05:49.250> end

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
you can just put one of the rubber end

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.749 
you can just put one of the rubber end
caps<00:05:49.759> that<00:05:49.880> they<00:05:50.030> give<00:05:50.210> you<00:05:50.330> with<00:05:50.449> the<00:05:50.570> kit

00:05:51.749 --> 00:05:51.759 
caps that they give you with the kit

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:55.260 
caps that they give you with the kit
there<00:05:52.759> you<00:05:52.820> go

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.800

so what we're left with is just the

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.080 
so what we're left with is just the
diaphragm<00:05:59.810> here<00:06:00.110> I<00:06:00.310> took<00:06:01.310> this<00:06:01.460> piece<00:06:01.699> off<00:06:01.940> too

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.090

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:07.490 
off the bracket here just so I can kinda

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.189 
off the bracket here just so I can kinda
get<00:06:07.610> some<00:06:07.729> movement<00:06:08.060> out<00:06:08.120> of<00:06:08.180> it

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:09.199 
get some movement out of it
