been<00:03:43.900> an<00:03:43.989> interesting<00:03:44.200> thing<00:03:44.530> because<00:03:44.950> it<00:03:45.220> was

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
been an interesting thing because it was

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.270 
been an interesting thing because it was
more<00:03:45.700> it<00:03:46.690> was<00:03:46.900> more<00:03:46.930> of<00:03:47.290> a<00:03:47.440> show<00:03:47.859> that<00:03:47.890> we<00:03:48.100> type

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
more it was more of a show that we type

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.520 
more it was more of a show that we type
thing<00:03:48.489> in<00:03:48.579> the<00:03:48.670> first<00:03:48.880> season<00:03:49.390> and<00:03:49.930> then<00:03:50.230> in

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
thing in the first season and then in

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:51.870 
thing in the first season and then in
the<00:03:50.590> second<00:03:50.859> season<00:03:50.980> they<00:03:51.190> had<00:03:51.310> more<00:03:51.489> of<00:03:51.549> an

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
the second season they had more of an

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.270 
the second season they had more of an
overarching<00:03:52.660> thing<00:03:53.049> so<00:03:53.230> it<00:03:53.320> seems<00:03:53.500> like<00:03:53.560> it's

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
overarching thing so it seems like it's

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.470 
overarching thing so it seems like it's
kind<00:03:54.609> of<00:03:54.640> weird<00:03:54.700> because<00:03:55.000> it<00:03:55.150> seems<00:03:55.359> like<00:03:55.390> a

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
kind of weird because it seems like a

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.330 
kind of weird because it seems like a
show<00:03:55.660> that's<00:03:55.840> still<00:03:56.100> finding<00:03:57.100> out<00:03:57.190> exactly

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
show that's still finding out exactly

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.819 
show that's still finding out exactly
what<00:03:57.790> it<00:03:57.880> wants<00:03:58.090> to<00:03:58.150> be<00:03:58.440> and<00:03:59.440> I<00:03:59.530> think<00:03:59.709> it's

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
what it wants to be and I think it's

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:01.440 
what it wants to be and I think it's
because<00:04:00.130> it's<00:04:00.340> the<00:04:00.430> it's<00:04:00.940> the<00:04:01.090> creator's

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
because it's the it's the creator's

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.210 
because it's the it's the creator's
longest-running<00:04:01.870> show<00:04:02.049> right<00:04:02.530> well<00:04:03.010> we<00:04:03.100> had

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 
were you were thrown in with these

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.350 
were you were thrown in with these
characters<00:05:05.830> and<00:05:06.430> they<00:05:06.580> were<00:05:06.640> so<00:05:06.910> great<00:05:07.150> and

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
characters and they were so great and

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.770

Archer was Archer hadn't developed yet
if<00:05:10.990> that<00:05:11.170> makes<00:05:11.380> a<00:05:11.620> lot<00:05:11.800> of<00:05:11.860> sense<00:05:12.190> like<00:05:12.280> he<00:05:12.610> was

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.010 
if that makes a lot of sense like he was
still<00:05:14.340> well<00:05:15.340> he's<00:05:15.700> the<00:05:16.360> thing<00:05:16.540> is<00:05:16.660> he<00:05:16.810> wasn't

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
still well he's the thing is he wasn't

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.120 
still well he's the thing is he wasn't
in<00:05:18.060> season<00:05:19.060> one<00:05:19.300> he<00:05:19.510> wasn't<00:05:19.890> aware<00:05:20.890> that<00:05:20.950> he

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.130 
in season one he wasn't aware that he

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:22.830 
in season one he wasn't aware that he
was<00:05:21.310> an<00:05:21.430> asshole<00:05:21.580> mm-hmm<00:05:22.330> and<00:05:22.420> as<00:05:22.540> he's<00:05:22.660> just

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
was an asshole mm-hmm and as he's just

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.440 
was an asshole mm-hmm and as he's just
gone<00:05:22.990> on<00:05:23.020> he's<00:05:23.230> become<00:05:23.530> aware<00:05:23.860> so<00:05:24.250> it's<00:05:24.450> it's

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:25.450 
gone on he's become aware so it's it's

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.200 
gone on he's become aware so it's it's
kind<00:05:25.510> of<00:05:25.690> less<00:05:25.900> likable<00:05:26.470> that<00:05:26.650> he<00:05:26.910> is<00:05:27.910> aware

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
kind of less likable that he is aware

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:29.430 
kind of less likable that he is aware
that<00:05:28.330> he's<00:05:28.450> an<00:05:28.570> asshole<00:05:28.720> like<00:05:28.870> before<00:05:29.230> he

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 
that he's an asshole like before he

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.140 
that he's an asshole like before he
didn't<00:05:29.710> know<00:05:29.890> really<00:05:30.250> so<00:05:30.640> he<00:05:30.730> was<00:05:30.850> trying<00:05:30.970> to

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
didn't know really so he was trying to

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.140 
didn't know really so he was trying to
learn<00:05:31.360> about<00:05:31.720> that<00:05:32.490> but<00:05:33.490> that's<00:05:33.670> that's<00:05:34.000> that

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
learn about that but that's that's that

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.850 
learn about that but that's that's that
doesn't<00:05:34.900> really<00:05:35.020> detract<00:05:35.260> from<00:05:35.410> the<00:05:35.560> show<00:05:35.740> at

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
doesn't really detract from the show at

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.410 
doesn't really detract from the show at
all<00:05:35.980> but<00:05:36.250> for<00:05:36.460> me<00:05:36.550> it<00:05:36.610> was<00:05:36.700> just<00:05:36.730> awesome<00:05:37.120> and<00:05:37.360> I

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000 
put it into more more grounded

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.110 
put it into more more grounded
situations<00:06:04.600> so<00:06:04.960> very<00:06:05.580> bombastic<00:06:06.580> and<00:06:06.880> stuff

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:12.580 
that and I just think it worked so so

that and I just think it worked so so
well<00:06:12.760> so<00:06:12.940> that's<00:06:13.090> why<00:06:13.240> I<00:06:13.510> love<00:06:14.140> season<00:06:14.440> one

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:14.620 
well so that's why I love season one

well so that's why I love season one
mm-hmm<00:06:15.160> I<00:06:15.190> think<00:06:16.290> for<00:06:17.290> season<00:06:17.590> one<00:06:17.740> it

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:17.890 
mm-hmm I think for season one it

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:19.770 
mm-hmm I think for season one it
satisfied<00:06:18.490> a<00:06:18.520> lot<00:06:18.790> of<00:06:18.910> hungers<00:06:19.270> that<00:06:19.480> people

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:19.780 
satisfied a lot of hungers that people

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.560 
satisfied a lot of hungers that people
had<00:06:19.960> like<00:06:20.850> Arrested<00:06:21.850> Development<00:06:22.270> was<00:06:22.360> gone

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:22.570 
had like Arrested Development was gone

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:23.910 
had like Arrested Development was gone
but<00:06:22.780> we<00:06:22.840> got<00:06:22.990> a<00:06:23.020> little<00:06:23.260> bit<00:06:23.350> more<00:06:23.380> Lucille

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:23.920 
but we got a little bit more Lucille

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.730 
but we got a little bit more Lucille
Bluth<00:06:24.190> and<00:06:24.460> H<00:06:24.970> John<00:06:25.240> Benjamin<00:06:25.840> gets<00:06:26.350> more<00:06:26.560> work

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:26.740 
Bluth and H John Benjamin gets more work

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.350 
Bluth and H John Benjamin gets more work
and<00:06:27.010> we<00:06:27.130> all<00:06:27.250> long<00:06:27.550> for<00:06:27.580> those<00:06:27.850> Adult<00:06:28.150> Swim

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:28.360 
and we all long for those Adult Swim

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.830 
and we all long for those Adult Swim
days<00:06:28.570> where<00:06:28.900> he<00:06:28.990> was<00:06:29.140> in<00:06:29.260> every<00:06:29.470> show<00:06:29.650> and<00:06:30.720> no<00:06:31.720> I

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:31.840 
days where he was in every show and no I

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.870 
days where he was in every show and no I
think<00:06:32.320> it's<00:06:32.440> just<00:06:32.530> like<00:06:32.770> it's<00:06:33.460> struck<00:06:33.760> while

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:33.880 
think it's just like it's struck while

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.220 
think it's just like it's struck while
the<00:06:34.000> iron<00:06:34.150> was<00:06:34.240> hot<00:06:34.330> and<00:06:34.660> a<00:06:34.720> lot<00:06:34.840> of<00:06:34.870> really

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:35.230 
the iron was hot and a lot of really

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:35.540 
the iron was hot and a lot of really
good

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:35.550 
good

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:37.400 
good
I'm<00:06:35.880> wondering<00:06:36.360> though<00:06:36.510> I<00:06:36.810> mean<00:06:37.050> it<00:06:37.230> seems

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:37.410 
I'm wondering though I mean it seems

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:38.990 
I'm wondering though I mean it seems
like<00:06:37.530> they<00:06:37.650> have<00:06:37.680> a<00:06:37.800> tall<00:06:38.070> order<00:06:38.280> to<00:06:38.430> fill<00:06:38.580> to

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.000 
like they have a tall order to fill to

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.980 
like they have a tall order to fill to
be<00:06:39.120> able<00:06:39.210> to<00:06:39.720> be<00:06:40.230> as<00:06:40.530> relevant<00:06:41.220> and<00:06:41.790> fast<00:06:42.600> and

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:42.990 
be able to be as relevant and fast and

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.920 
be able to be as relevant and fast and
witty<00:06:43.350> as<00:06:43.620> maybe<00:06:44.220> the<00:06:44.490> earlier<00:06:44.820> seasons<00:06:45.180> is<00:06:45.630> it

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:45.930 
witty as maybe the earlier seasons is it

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:47.300 
witty as maybe the earlier seasons is it
something<00:06:46.380> that's<00:06:46.500> even<00:06:46.650> possible<00:06:47.130> at<00:06:47.220> this

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:47.310 
something that's even possible at this

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:48.890 
something that's even possible at this
point<00:06:47.580> when<00:06:47.730> we've<00:06:47.850> explored<00:06:48.270> the<00:06:48.420> characters

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:48.900 
point when we've explored the characters

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:53.480 
point when we've explored the characters
maybe<00:06:49.800> two<00:06:50.250> maybe<00:06:50.940> two<00:06:51.090> their<00:06:51.420> limits<00:06:52.190> yeah<00:06:53.190> I

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:53.490 
maybe two maybe two their limits yeah I

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:55.450 
maybe two maybe two their limits yeah I
definitely<00:06:53.640> think<00:06:54.180> so<00:06:54.330> like<00:06:54.720> I<00:06:54.840> think<00:06:54.930> and

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:55.460 
definitely think so like I think and

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.280 
definitely think so like I think and
ours<00:06:56.460> are<00:06:56.640> still<00:06:56.850> a<00:06:57.060> fantastic<00:06:57.300> show<00:06:57.870> like

00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:58.290 
ours are still a fantastic show like
