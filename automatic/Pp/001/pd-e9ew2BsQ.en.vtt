three<00:02:10.009> different<00:02:10.280> kinds<00:02:10.399> of<00:02:10.520> Aesop's<00:02:10.970> of

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
three different kinds of Aesop's of

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.660 
three different kinds of Aesop's of
course<00:02:11.390> this<00:02:11.599> is<00:02:11.720> a<00:02:11.750> sigh<00:02:12.130> shoot<00:02:13.130> it<00:02:13.280> boosts<00:02:13.459> up

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
course this is a sigh shoot it boosts up

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.290 
course this is a sigh shoot it boosts up

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
and maybe come in handy at some point

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.199 
and maybe come in handy at some point
but<00:02:17.599> I<00:02:17.870> doubt<00:02:18.230> it<00:02:18.620> and<00:02:18.830> another<00:02:19.220> girl<00:02:19.459> final

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209

poll okay at last we got something

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.520 
poll okay at last we got something
reasonably<00:02:24.410> decent<00:02:24.650> four-star<00:02:25.489> vista<00:02:26.200> 5<00:02:27.200> star

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
reasonably decent four-star vista 5 star

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.559 
reasonably decent four-star vista 5 star
would<00:02:27.680> have<00:02:27.769> been<00:02:27.890> better<00:02:28.040> obviously<00:02:28.819> the

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
would have been better obviously the

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.350 
would have been better obviously the
four-star<00:02:30.170> we<00:02:30.260> can<00:02:30.410> work<00:02:30.560> with<00:02:30.590> that<00:02:30.769> we<00:02:31.040> can

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
four-star we can work with that we can

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.839 
four-star we can work with that we can
level<00:02:32.360> him<00:02:32.450> up<00:02:32.599> and<00:02:32.930> evolve<00:02:33.800> him<00:02:34.069> concede<00:02:34.640> does

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
level so you can see everything I pulled

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.729 
level so you can see everything I pulled
I<00:02:45.680> did<00:02:46.160> a<00:02:46.269> 6<00:02:47.269> Paul<00:02:47.630> just<00:02:47.959> now<00:02:48.140> and<00:02:48.350> I<00:02:48.380> did<00:02:48.530> two

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
I did a 6 Paul just now and I did two

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.620 
I did a 6 Paul just now and I did two
before<00:02:49.130> where<00:02:49.340> I<00:02:49.400> got<00:02:49.610> another<00:02:49.940> yourself<00:02:50.420> and

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
before where I got another yourself and

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.350 
before where I got another yourself and
a<00:02:51.010> three-star<00:02:52.010> buggy<00:02:52.250> which<00:02:52.549> doesn't<00:02:53.269> help

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
a three-star buggy which doesn't help

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.699 
a three-star buggy which doesn't help
talk<00:02:53.660> they've<00:02:53.870> already<00:02:53.959> got<00:02:54.170> four<00:02:54.380> style

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
talk they've already got four style

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.030 
talk they've already got four style
buggy<00:02:55.010> so<00:02:55.250> all<00:02:55.940> in<00:02:56.180> all<00:02:56.590> I'd<00:02:57.590> say<00:02:57.650> that's

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
buggy so all in all I'd say that's

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.870 
buggy so all in all I'd say that's
pretty<00:02:58.430> much<00:02:58.880> jump<00:02:59.510> all<00:03:00.410> around<00:03:00.470> and<00:03:00.950> then<00:03:01.549> one

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
pretty much jump all around and then one

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.740 
pretty much jump all around and then one
reasonably<00:03:02.540> decent<00:03:02.900> thing<00:03:03.319> with<00:03:03.530> the<00:03:03.680> Vista

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
reasonably decent thing with the Vista

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.449 
reasonably decent thing with the Vista
probably<00:03:05.750> going<00:03:05.900> to<00:03:06.019> level<00:03:06.860> up<00:03:07.010> the<00:03:07.130> western

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
probably going to level up the western

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.550 
probably going to level up the western
start<00:03:07.819> thinking<00:03:08.180> about<00:03:08.269> maybe<00:03:08.569> some<00:03:08.930> int

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
start thinking about maybe some int

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.069 
start thinking about maybe some int
teams<00:03:09.920> that<00:03:10.130> I<00:03:10.160> could<00:03:10.400> use<00:03:10.609> or<00:03:10.880> have<00:03:11.690> him<00:03:11.840> as<00:03:12.049> a

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079 
teams that I could use or have him as a

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:16.599 
teams that I could use or have him as a
an<00:03:12.739> extra<00:03:13.459> on<00:03:13.579> a<00:03:13.609> flashy<00:03:14.359> team<00:03:15.250> you<00:03:16.250> can<00:03:16.370> see

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:16.609 
an extra on a flashy team you can see

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:19.120 
an extra on a flashy team you can see
what<00:03:16.730> kind<00:03:17.060> of<00:03:17.150> the<00:03:17.390> other<00:03:18.380> characters<00:03:18.709> have

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
what kind of the other characters have

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.130 
what kind of the other characters have
got<00:03:19.400> so<00:03:19.760> that<00:03:20.269> makes<00:03:20.450> three<00:03:20.660> different<00:03:21.019> kinds

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
got so that makes three different kinds

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.289 
got so that makes three different kinds
of<00:03:21.290> sorrows<00:03:21.680> and<00:03:21.709> the<00:03:22.069> three<00:03:22.910> different<00:03:23.060> kinds
