a<00:04:46.980> villain<00:04:47.490> back<00:04:47.700> then<00:04:47.970> too<00:04:48.270> so<00:04:48.570> I<00:04:48.600> think<00:04:49.020> his

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 
a villain back then too so I think his

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.020 
a villain back then too so I think his
character<00:04:49.590> was<00:04:49.800> actually<00:04:50.040> correct<00:04:50.580> for<00:04:50.910> the

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
one hit and the hit detection seemed to

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.330 
one hit and the hit detection seemed to
work<00:05:00.810> pretty<00:05:01.140> well<00:05:01.560> if<00:05:01.860> you<00:05:01.950> were<00:05:02.100> close
