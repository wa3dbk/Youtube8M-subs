00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260
 Hi. For those who have not seen the dancing bears, 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
 Here are the dancing bears. 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
 In 1995 we began work on a two-year research project 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
 To try to understand what is going on. 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
 Because it is clear that the lazy bears in the wild began to decrease 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
 By doing so. 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.260
 This is the Calandar community. They are a marginalized Muslim community 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
 Who lived in India, 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.260
 They have been in India since the 13th century. 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
 We're looking for clues about what's going on there. 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
 These images from the hidden camera are below. 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
 We went and pretended we were buyers. 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
 We found this in every state, in Karnataka. 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
 The young bears were hunted from all over the country 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
 They are sold and traded. 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
 Was sold about two thousand dollars for one, 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
 It was used to stew the bear's claw, 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
 They are also trained, later, 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.260
 Become the Dancer Bears like this you just saw. 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.260
 Unfortunately, the families of the Calendrians depend on this bear. 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
 These couple are only 18 years old. 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260
 They already have four children next to them. You can see them. 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
 Family economics and livelihoods depend on those animals. 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
 So, we had to deal in a very practical way and a sustainable framework. 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
 Now, when we started to work deeper and dig deeper, 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
 We found that this is not a legal act. 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
 Those people may go to jail for more than seven years 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
 If arrested by the authorities. 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
 What they do to the bears was really awful. 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
 It is totally unacceptable. 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
 The mother bear is usually killed. 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
 Children are taken, dispersed. 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
 Their teeth are struck with a metal rod. 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.260
 They use a hot red iron needle to make a hole through the muzzle. 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.260
 Now we should start to change those people and turn them from doing so 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
 For their living, to do something else. 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
 So, this is Beto Kalandar, which was our first experience. 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
 We were not sure this would work. 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
 We were not sure at all. We arranged to convince him. 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
 We have said, "Well, here are some seeds of help. 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
 Let's see if you can get something else. "The bear handed us over 

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
 To - We created a sanctuary. We have four sanctuaries in India. 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
 Now he sells refreshments, which is next to the highway. 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
 It has a communications shop. 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
 Then I started, there was no retreat after that. 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
 This is the Sada who came and delivered his own bear. 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.260
 Now he runs a cattle feed and a grain store 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
 Near I read. 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
 Then we did not look back at all, all of us. 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
 We made wheels rickshaw. 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
 We set up textile fabric units, 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
 Training courses for women. 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
 Women were not allowed out of society 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
 And working with the rest of society. So, we could handle that. 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
 Education. Children never went to school. 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
 They receive only a little bit of Islamic education. 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
 They were never allowed to go to school 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
 Because they were earning an increase in manual labor at home. So we arranged to provide education. 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.260
 So, we are sponsoring education programs for 600 children today. 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
 We have been able to secure a brighter future for these people 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.260
 Of course we had to involve bears in the matter. 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
 This is what happens to the bear when we receive it. 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
 This is what happens to them of transformation. 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
 We have a veterinary care facility in our rescue centers. 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
 So, 2002 was there 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
 12 thousand dancing bears. 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
 We rescued more than 550 dances. 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
 We have been able to secure a better future for these people and those bears. 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
 The joyous news I want to announce today 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
 We next month will bring 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
 Latest Indian Bears, 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
 To our rescue center. 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.260
 (clap) 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.260
 India will no longer see this brutal barbaric practice 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
 Which had been here for centuries. 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
 People can raise their heads high. 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
 The Calderians will overcome all this barbarous savage past 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
 Which they have lived throughout their lives. 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
 The beautiful bears can certainly live in the wild again. 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.260
 These bears will not be removed. 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
 Children, both human beings and lazy bears 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
 They can live in peace. thank you. 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.260
 (clap)
