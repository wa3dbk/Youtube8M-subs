00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
down in here that there's loops you can

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.880 
down in here that there's loops you can
let<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.949> string<00:00:53.219> go<00:00:53.430> out<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.879> not<00:00:54.890> through

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659 
now that I have my strings and loops

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:18.649 
now that I have my strings and loops
lined<00:02:15.989> up<00:02:16.230> and<00:02:16.379> it's<00:02:17.040> nice<00:02:17.189> and<00:02:17.459> flat<00:02:17.700> I<00:02:18.060> want
