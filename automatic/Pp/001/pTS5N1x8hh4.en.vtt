 the killer 67600 if if they managed to 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.940
 have this map 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.920
 so how did they do I do not know if 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.539
 it's a little bit abused because he would have a 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.010
 little bit of a bowl trying to do 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:55.170
 to make the glitch to have the xp 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:57.030
 experts in private they have in addition they 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.870
 were lucky what here fell 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.180
 on this map 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.140
 So then that's where they have me and me 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.510
 proposed to join them 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.549
 and as I can verbal I purge that 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.590
 all this and I present you today 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.360
 this video so the video is not going to be 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.530
 very long but it's still pretty 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.409
 what the fuck 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.659
 it can be said to have this map on 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.729
 black ops the so is treyarch 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.439
 will do us like he had 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.630
 does for us the three ie 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.820
 we put old maps and we 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.229
 can already see them in advance it's with 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.979
 a little bug that had to be done in the 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.140
 Main Menu 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.040
 I do not know if you too are 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.570
 remember, anyway, I remember 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.700
 recalls very well and we could see 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.549
 hens and maps that were in 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.710
 offshore commissions and all that and 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.030
 so I do not know if they decided 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.720
 to do the same for us black 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.070
 ops 2 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.710
 in any case, it's really good 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.590
 surprise so here I hope this 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.240
 little video you will have liked the passage goes 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.920
 you see now that when we launch 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.439
 the end part when the game starts 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.780
 unfortunately we do not fall into 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.880
 the ear but in a map there it was 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.799
 great here so that's it 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.810
 I hope this little video you 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.399
 will be pleased if this is the case do not hesitate to 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.990
