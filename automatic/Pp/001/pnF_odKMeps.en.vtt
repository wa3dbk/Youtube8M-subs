starting to get the movements under

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:36.039 
starting to get the movements under
control<00:03:34.459> so<00:03:34.819> that<00:03:35.150> should<00:03:35.750> be<00:03:35.810> your<00:03:35.900> main

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
control so that should be your main

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:40.050

focus

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.420 

okay<00:03:40.810> so<00:03:40.870> for<00:03:41.290> the<00:03:41.349> half<00:03:41.530> kneeling<00:03:41.860> medicine

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
okay so for the half kneeling medicine

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.089 
okay so for the half kneeling medicine
ball<00:03:42.610> shop<00:03:42.910> they<00:03:43.390> use<00:03:43.510> my<00:03:43.630> iron<00:03:43.840> and<00:03:44.530> it<00:03:45.010> would

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:45.099 
ball shop they use my iron and it would

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:46.979 
ball shop they use my iron and it would
have<00:03:45.190> been<00:03:45.250> great<00:03:45.459> if<00:03:45.640> my<00:03:46.060> iron<00:03:46.300> record<00:03:46.810> list

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
have been great if my iron record list

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.290 
have been great if my iron record list
but<00:03:47.110> it's<00:03:47.230> not<00:03:47.440> I<00:03:47.739> probably<00:03:48.459> be<00:03:48.640> helpful<00:03:48.790> to<00:03:49.120> if

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 
but it's not I probably be helpful to if

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:50.430 
but it's not I probably be helpful to if
it<00:03:49.420> didn't<00:03:49.569> have<00:03:49.660> water<00:03:49.840> but<00:03:50.110> it<00:03:50.260> actually

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
it didn't have water but it actually

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.339 
it didn't have water but it actually
does<00:03:50.739> have<00:03:50.920> some<00:03:51.690> so<00:03:52.690> if<00:03:52.810> they<00:03:52.959> won't<00:03:53.140> make<00:03:53.260> a

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:53.349 
does have some so if they won't make a

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:58.350 
does have some so if they won't make a
mess<00:03:53.470> today<00:03:54.720> but<00:03:55.720> just<00:03:55.989> assume<00:03:56.739> my<00:03:57.360> half

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
mess today but just assume my half

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.930 
mess today but just assume my half
