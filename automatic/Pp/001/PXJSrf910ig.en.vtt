00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:38.450 
I have one big problem with him where is

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.770 
I have one big problem with him where is
his<00:00:38.720> chocolate<00:00:39.380> beam<00:00:39.560> if<00:00:39.860> only<00:00:40.850> one<00:00:41.120> boo<00:00:41.480> was

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
his chocolate beam if only one boo was

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.810 
his chocolate beam if only one boo was
allowed<00:00:42.080> to<00:00:42.230> have<00:00:42.410> that<00:00:42.620> attack<00:00:42.950> it<00:00:43.250> would<00:00:43.640> be

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
allowed to have that attack it would be

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.030 
allowed to have that attack it would be
this<00:00:44.030> one<00:00:44.270> and<00:00:44.480> yet<00:00:44.989> he<00:00:45.200> doesn't<00:00:45.410> have<00:00:45.680> it<00:00:45.860> it

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:46.040 
this one and yet he doesn't have it it

00:00:46.040 --> 00:01:03.280 
this one and yet he doesn't have it it
really<00:00:46.520> makes<00:00:46.670> no<00:00:47.000> sense<00:00:47.450> at<00:00:47.630> all

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:18.130

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
really this is such a minor character he

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.300 
really this is such a minor character he
only<00:01:21.750> had<00:01:21.900> one<00:01:22.200> fight<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:22.800> it<00:01:22.890> wasn't<00:01:23.070> even

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
only had one fight and it wasn't even

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.910 
only had one fight and it wasn't even
against<00:01:23.760> one<00:01:23.910> of<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.090> heroes<00:01:24.530> you<00:01:25.530> can<00:01:25.680> even

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
against one of the heroes you can even

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.430 
against one of the heroes you can even
see<00:01:26.160> how<00:01:26.340> lazy<00:01:26.670> they<00:01:27.060> were<00:01:27.120> with<00:01:27.570> him<00:01:27.750> with<00:01:28.290> the

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
see how lazy they were with him with the

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.469 
see how lazy they were with him with the
exception<00:01:28.920> of<00:01:29.010> one<00:01:29.370> blast<00:01:29.760> one<00:01:30.090> he<00:01:30.360> is<00:01:30.390> the

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
exception of one blast one he is the

00:01:30.479 --> 00:02:07.440 
exception of one blast one he is the
exact<00:01:31.020> same<00:01:31.320> moveset<00:01:31.920> as<00:01:32.100> fat<00:01:32.400> boo

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.499 

you

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.970 

I<00:02:12.570> like<00:02:13.570> how<00:02:13.780> his<00:02:13.990> Vice<00:02:14.290> shout<00:02:14.620> has<00:02:14.860> an

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
I like how his Vice shout has an

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.830 
I like how his Vice shout has an
animation<00:02:15.430> that<00:02:15.610> follows<00:02:16.120> what<00:02:16.360> he<00:02:16.450> did<00:02:16.660> with

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
animation that follows what he did with

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.260 
animation that follows what he did with
that<00:02:17.020> move<00:02:17.260> a<00:02:17.470> nice<00:02:18.040> circle<00:02:18.520> to<00:02:18.670> rip<00:02:18.910> open<00:02:19.030> the

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
that move a nice circle to rip open the

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.560 
that move a nice circle to rip open the
universe<00:02:19.860> for<00:02:20.860> the<00:02:20.890> rest<00:02:21.160> of<00:02:21.340> it<00:02:21.490> no<00:02:21.910> problems

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
universe for the rest of it no problems

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:28.050 
universe for the rest of it no problems
at<00:02:22.750> all

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:44.430 

I'll<00:02:29.060> kill<00:02:29.480> you<00:02:29.630> nice<00:02:29.930> and<00:02:30.260> easy

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:03:04.699 

ah

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.979 

the<00:03:05.709> transformation<00:03:06.549> is<00:03:06.670> okay<00:03:07.180> it's<00:03:07.719> nice

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
the transformation is okay it's nice

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:09.929 
the transformation is okay it's nice
that<00:03:08.019> he<00:03:08.290> doesn't<00:03:08.590> simply<00:03:08.920> just<00:03:09.219> transform<00:03:09.790> by

00:03:09.929 --> 00:03:09.939 
that he doesn't simply just transform by

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:12.149 
that he doesn't simply just transform by
powering<00:03:10.299> up<00:03:10.510> but<00:03:11.049> it<00:03:11.139> doesn't<00:03:11.319> show<00:03:11.650> who<00:03:11.920> he

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:12.159 
powering up but it doesn't show who he

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:15.030 
powering up but it doesn't show who he
absorbed<00:03:12.700> for<00:03:13.659> his<00:03:13.840> attacks<00:03:14.260> they<00:03:14.650> did<00:03:14.799> a<00:03:14.829> good

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
absorbed for his attacks they did a good

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.220 
absorbed for his attacks they did a good
job<00:03:15.099> with<00:03:15.370> them<00:03:15.670> one<00:03:16.180> from<00:03:16.480> go<00:03:16.629> tanks<00:03:17.049> and

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
job with them one from go tanks and

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.289 
job with them one from go tanks and
another<00:03:17.469> from<00:03:17.680> piccolo<00:03:18.159> shows<00:03:18.819> off<00:03:19.090> the

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
another from piccolo shows off the

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:28.520 
another from piccolo shows off the
attacks<00:03:19.629> he<00:03:19.840> just<00:03:20.049> gotten<00:03:20.409> all<00:03:20.560> that

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:04:00.020

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.610 

same<00:04:09.760> issue<00:04:10.030> with<00:04:10.390> the<00:04:10.540> transformation<00:04:11.320> here

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
same issue with the transformation here

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.520 
same issue with the transformation here
of<00:04:11.770> course<00:04:12.210> now<00:04:13.210> to<00:04:13.270> talk<00:04:13.630> about<00:04:13.810> his<00:04:14.080> ultimate

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
of course now to talk about his ultimate

of course now to talk about his ultimate
this<00:04:14.980> is<00:04:15.310> the<00:04:15.550> correct<00:04:15.850> form<00:04:16.060> to<00:04:16.270> have<00:04:16.420> that

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
this is the correct form to have that

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.290 
this is the correct form to have that
attack<00:04:16.900> use<00:04:17.590> it<00:04:17.800> on<00:04:17.920> vegeto<00:04:18.459> and<00:04:18.700> thus<00:04:18.970> he<00:04:19.209> had

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:19.300 
attack use it on vegeto and thus he had

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:22.440 
attack use it on vegeto and thus he had
already<00:04:19.480> absorbed<00:04:20.050> Gohan<00:04:20.580> so<00:04:21.580> no<00:04:21.910> problems

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
already absorbed Gohan so no problems

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.060 
already absorbed Gohan so no problems
here<00:04:22.690> though<00:04:23.020> when<00:04:23.320> compared<00:04:23.770> with<00:04:23.890> his

here though when compared with his
previous<00:04:24.280> form<00:04:24.790> he<00:04:25.060> feels<00:04:25.300> a<00:04:25.390> little<00:04:25.540> more

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
previous form he feels a little more

00:04:25.810 --> 00:05:05.380 
previous form he feels a little more
bland

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:05.390

fine<00:05:11.910> but<00:05:12.330> I<00:05:12.360> have<00:05:12.600> to<00:05:12.780> ask<00:05:12.960> why<00:05:13.650> doesn't<00:05:14.100> super

boo have that rush he used it to destroy
the<00:05:17.010> lookout<00:05:17.370> so<00:05:17.730> you<00:05:17.790> would<00:05:17.970> think<00:05:18.000> his<00:05:18.360> base

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
the lookout so you would think his base

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.040 
the lookout so you would think his base
form<00:05:18.960> could<00:05:19.170> have<00:05:19.350> it<00:05:19.530> or<00:05:19.650> something
