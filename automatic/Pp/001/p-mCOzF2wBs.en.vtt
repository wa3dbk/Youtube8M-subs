00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
he was absolutely fantastic

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.130 
he was absolutely fantastic
when<00:01:28.619> gala<00:01:28.860> was<00:01:29.040> amazing<00:01:29.430> on<00:01:29.520> his<00:01:29.640> debut<00:01:30.049> and<00:01:31.049> I

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
when gala was amazing on his debut and I

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.210 
when gala was amazing on his debut and I
just<00:01:31.320> think<00:01:31.439> him<00:01:31.530> go<00:01:31.650> for<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.890> whole<00:01:32.009> team

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
just think him go for the whole team

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.429 
just think him go for the whole team
today<00:01:32.520> from<00:01:32.790> when<00:01:33.450> we<00:01:33.570> had<00:01:33.600> 11<00:01:34.020> men<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.350> think

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
today from when we had 11 men I think

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.649 
today from when we had 11 men I think
was<00:01:34.710> probably<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.100> stronger<00:01:35.430> team<00:01:35.540> and<00:01:36.540> then

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
was probably the stronger team and then

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.289 
was probably the stronger team and then
when<00:01:36.840> we<00:01:36.930> had<00:01:37.110> 10<00:01:37.619> men<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:37.920> think<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.909> desire<00:01:39.270> to

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
when we had 10 men I think the desire to

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.399 
when we had 10 men I think the desire to
try<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.630> get<00:01:39.840> back<00:01:39.990> in<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.200> game<00:01:40.350> you

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
try and get back in the game you

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.450 
try and get back in the game you
wouldn't<00:01:40.650> have<00:01:40.799> even<00:01:40.890> noticed<00:01:41.130> that<00:01:41.310> they

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
wouldn't have even noticed that they

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.889 
wouldn't have even noticed that they
were<00:01:41.490> 10<00:01:41.729> minutes<00:01:42.030> I've<00:01:42.210> ever<00:01:42.540> played<00:01:42.689> for

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
were 10 minutes I've ever played for

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:43.310 
were 10 minutes I've ever played for
less

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
less

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.899 
less
how<00:01:43.680> big<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:43.920> point<00:01:44.159> do<00:01:44.369> you<00:01:44.430> think<00:01:44.579> this<00:01:44.729> could

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
how big a point do you think this could

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.730 
how big a point do you think this could
prove<00:01:45.119> come<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.479> end<00:01:45.600> of<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.750> season<00:01:46.049> were

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
prove come the end of the season were

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:47.990 
prove come the end of the season were
they<00:01:46.829> were<00:01:46.890> all<00:01:46.979> important<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.610> we've<00:01:47.850> had<00:01:47.970> a

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
they were all important and we've had a

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.999 
they were all important and we've had a
tough<00:01:48.479> style<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:48.869> paper<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.530> we've<00:01:49.860> got

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
tough style and paper and we've got

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.260 
tough style and paper and we've got
through<00:01:50.220> that<00:01:50.430> we<00:01:50.579> were<00:01:50.670> obviously<00:01:50.970> further

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
through that we were obviously further

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.539 
through that we were obviously further
behind<00:01:51.530> the<00:01:52.530> lead<00:01:52.710> in<00:01:52.829> what<00:01:52.979> you'd<00:01:53.159> want<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.399> be

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
behind the lead in what you'd want to be

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.280 
behind the lead in what you'd want to be
with<00:01:53.729> him<00:01:54.090> I<00:01:54.119> asked<00:01:54.420> but<00:01:54.570> people<00:01:54.899> coming<00:01:55.170> back

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
with him I asked but people coming back

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.990 
with him I asked but people coming back
from<00:01:55.439> World<00:01:55.680> Cups<00:01:55.950> it's<00:01:56.250> been<00:01:56.399> a<00:01:56.430> funny<00:01:56.700> start

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
from World Cups it's been a funny start

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.880 
from World Cups it's been a funny start
for<00:01:57.149> us<00:01:57.240> but<00:01:57.390> I<00:01:57.450> think<00:01:57.630> wants<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:58.020> be<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.680> bit<00:01:58.829> of

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
for us but I think wants to be a bit of

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.069 
for us but I think wants to be a bit of
flow<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.369> hopefully<00:02:00.270> show<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.570> we<00:02:00.659> put<00:02:00.840> games

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
flow and hopefully show and we put games

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.420 
flow and hopefully show and we put games
together<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:01.439> win<00:02:01.619> games<00:02:01.860> will<00:02:02.130> be<00:02:02.219> right<00:02:02.399> up

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
together and win games will be right up

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.889 
together and win games will be right up
there<00:02:02.610> I<00:02:02.759> think<00:02:02.909> it's<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:03.210> score<00:02:03.420> do<00:02:03.540> deserve<00:02:03.810> to

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
there I think it's a score do deserve to

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.959 
there I think it's a score do deserve to
be<00:02:03.990> round<00:02:04.170> there<00:02:04.350> so<00:02:05.189> now<00:02:05.310> I've<00:02:05.430> got<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:05.729> start

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
be round there so now I've got to start

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.419 
be round there so now I've got to start
the<00:02:06.030> defense<00:02:06.299> of<00:02:06.540> our<00:02:06.630> Capital<00:02:07.259> One<00:02:07.439> Cup<00:02:07.649> title

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
the defense of our Capital One Cup title

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.589 
the defense of our Capital One Cup title
against<00:02:08.670> Sheffield<00:02:08.970> Wednesday

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
against Sheffield Wednesday

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.210 
against Sheffield Wednesday
yep<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.349> you

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
yep and you

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.470 
yep and you
we<00:02:11.310> have<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.520> be<00:02:11.610> on<00:02:11.700> it<00:02:11.850> because<00:02:11.970> these<00:02:12.240> games

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
we have to be on it because these games

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.850 
we have to be on it because these games
are<00:02:12.660> only<00:02:12.750> as<00:02:12.990> tough<00:02:13.170> as<00:02:13.290> you<00:02:13.320> make<00:02:13.530> them<00:02:13.680> and

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
are only as tough as you make them and

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.590 
are only as tough as you make them and
if<00:02:13.950> you're<00:02:14.160> on<00:02:14.250> if<00:02:15.000> you're<00:02:15.180> on<00:02:15.240> your<00:02:15.360> game<00:02:15.390> and

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
if you're on if you're on your game and

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.360 
if you're on if you're on your game and
we<00:02:15.870> all<00:02:15.900> approach<00:02:16.860> it<00:02:17.100> with<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:17.250> right

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
we all approach it with the right

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.860 
we all approach it with the right
attitude<00:02:17.520> and<00:02:17.820> it<00:02:18.000> should<00:02:18.270> be<00:02:18.390> a<00:02:18.420> win<00:02:18.630> for<00:02:18.810> us

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
attitude and it should be a win for us

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.020 
attitude and it should be a win for us
but<00:02:19.170> I<00:02:19.380> think<00:02:19.530> his<00:02:19.830> players<00:02:20.070> and<00:02:20.220> me<00:02:20.550> included

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
but I think his players and me included

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.400 
but I think his players and me included
that<00:02:21.120> need<00:02:21.330> games<00:02:21.570> that<00:02:21.780> want<00:02:21.930> to<00:02:21.990> play<00:02:22.110> them

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
that need games that want to play them

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.200 
that need games that want to play them
and<00:02:22.500> I<00:02:22.620> certainly<00:02:23.220> could<00:02:23.460> do<00:02:23.550> with<00:02:23.670> some<00:02:23.850> game

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
and I certainly could do with some game

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.300 
and I certainly could do with some game
time<00:02:24.450> to<00:02:24.630> get<00:02:24.780> to<00:02:24.900> my<00:02:25.080> little<00:02:25.650> peak<00:02:25.950> fitness

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
time to get to my little peak fitness

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.770 
time to get to my little peak fitness
that<00:02:26.430> I<00:02:26.490> feel<00:02:26.730> and<00:02:26.880> as<00:02:26.940> a<00:02:26.970> fuel<00:02:27.240> another<00:02:27.480> doing

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
that I feel and as a fuel another doing

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:28.820 
that I feel and as a fuel another doing
that<00:02:27.930> so<00:02:28.050> it's<00:02:28.170> a<00:02:28.200> great<00:02:28.350> opportunity<00:02:28.530> for

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
that so it's a great opportunity for

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.170 
that so it's a great opportunity for
those<00:02:29.010> players<00:02:29.280> to<00:02:29.460> come<00:02:29.640> in<00:02:29.760> and<00:02:29.910> show<00:02:30.030> what<00:02:30.150> I
