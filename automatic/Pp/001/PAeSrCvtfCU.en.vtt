00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.040
 turn off part of the series and I was the 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.830
 Christmas winter series with delia and lea 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.809
 and yes we have one day ourselves 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.160
 and that's how it goes 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.170
 christmas day but there are already 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.970
 That's why we wanted to think Christmas day 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.609
 I grow up in the Christmas winter day 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.470
 but yes, we have the day ourselves 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.000
 Conceived and, by the way, happy the game 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.830
 if you will join and why 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.830
 I'll start right now and that 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.779
 First question is real Christmas tree 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.910
 or plastic we always have 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.820
 a real Christmas tree as far as I am concerned 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.160
 was white so we had by once a 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.920
 plastic fir tree but otherwise we have 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.890
 not always are you just delivering real ones 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.320
 Christmas drainage so I wake up 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.500
 in the morning and then it is 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.199
 always so disgusting I long day with 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.800
 my 413 so that I am in the morning 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:58.109
 then in the Christmas tree soul and then 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.660
 The principle is already their san 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.289
 bruno white christmas 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.289
 we always see that 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.640
 and then she breaks with the whole house 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.010
 pine needles i love the upscale 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.650
 I always go downstairs 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.990
 4,2 and then we go in the evening we pull 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:23.350
 then we go to the church 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.600
 and then we go home then 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.340
 So Santa Claus is coming 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.710
 Insert my parents the gifts back 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.040
 and then we will prepare everything below 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.320
 in front 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.790
 and in fact now at my time 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.650
 sister to rooms have the hot 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.690
 chocolate and then comes my 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:41.290
 father national bell say so now 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:43.509

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.160
 is he coming down now? 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:47.350
 we have mostly relief and then 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.880
 fixed but sometimes eat and then 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.880
 This is also the case on the main tubes 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.180

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:58.930

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:06.580

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:08.320
 Do not you know you know christmas yes 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.739
 I celebrate Christmas so we celebrate 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.360
 that also quite normal fifth man when 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.790
 and how did your parents here is the 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.260
 The Santa Claus does not exist 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.180
 So I know the time where mine 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.739
 parents where I did not think that the 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.440
 Santa Claus gives and I can do that 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:25.230
 always great korso nikolaus konz too times 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.010
 The nikolaus came with my girlfriend and 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.989
 Christmas is always our neighbor 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.340
 through because he had such a household 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.080
 and then it's through the garden 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.220

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.410

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.830
 I think my sister has more 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.090
 Than ten, I believe my sister 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.040
 Of course I knew that already 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.630
 rather because it is their older and has 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.010
 you kind of still that 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.010
 but participated the following year 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.420
 she did not even say that once 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.100
 somehow said so to them that too 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.480

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.840
