00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:08.340
 Allow me to present a good day 

00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:10.270
 american model 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.740
 which is natural 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:18.280
 continuation of the concept of minimalist 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.960
 shoe invented and introduce a few years 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.360
 backwards 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.039
 Italian company vibro and I 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.350
 tell you what to offer 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:29.910
 offers us american today 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:33.100
 military shoe manufacturers are not a spoon 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:38.710
 I will dwell on how it happened 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:43.030
 that the concept was taken from ordinary 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:45.789
 civilian military shoes somewhere year 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.429
 back in the company began to run 

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:50.999
 treat military personnel and 

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:53.889
 representatives of power structures and 

00:00:50.999 --> 00:00:58.629
 asked to develop such a model 

00:00:53.889 --> 00:01:00.549
 which allowed them to engage not 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:02.100
 moments of fighting cars in 

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:03.850
 intervals during training 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.270
 classes on the parade ground 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.250
 and then take 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.530
 turned to my experience and 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.390
 forty years of cooperation with the company 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:19.990
 vibram that actually produces 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:22.899
 long ago run soles for shoes 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.119
 run a long time using the image of the sole 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:29.109
 derben for your shoes 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:32.670
 and today they decided to carry the concept 

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:35.560
 to turn in this model 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.050
 Him and nature year represents 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.820
 max physio 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:43.470
 logical parameters in order to at least 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.450
 Well, this is a parameter you owe me 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.110
 compare minimalist 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.540
 and standard heel standard heel 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:55.620
 standard heel lift is 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:59.790
 order 2 did not have time 20 20 20 and a half 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:02.820
 millimeters well actually everyone got used to 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.570
 whom high all on her go and sometimes not 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.980
 notice how it affects our back 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:12.440
 Here on this picture very well 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:16.650
 clearly visible here it is vertical body 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:18.650
 here it is he heel and how 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:23.430
 here is this corner 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:26.130
 affects the very spine itself under 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.470
 normal woman and boat 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.230
 happens after she puts on 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.810
 there are shoes with high heels 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.910
 there is a strong curvature here in this 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.730
 parts you Losers and accordingly here 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.940
 here what it threatens to display what 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.410
 lower back muscles they tighten 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.530
 constantly in tense 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:49.140
 condition and firstly it is not only 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.050
 fraught with the fact that there is a current more 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.239
 back one will also find that 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:56.150
 afterwards 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:03:00.570
 out is spinal curvature and 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:02.820
 Here is the company Beli introduces here such 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.050
 beautiful shoes look by itself 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.180
 imagine the shape of the sole 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.959
 she is not standard she is completely 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.730
 repeats the shape of a knock and here it is normal 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.770
 Standard sole which we all 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.420
 accustomed to and that's how the shoes that today 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.730
 rupture 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.790
 there was a company moving stuff 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:26.209
 used and later and high strength 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:28.550
 tarp or as we call it nylon 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:31.390
 but actually it â€™s our way in Russian 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:34.850
 tarpaulin is a high strength material 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:37.750
 which allows you to serve this long 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:40.269
 the shoe itself is this variation 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.800
 steppe or desert shoes 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.580
 more suitable for summer conditions 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.720
 operation 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.650
 but in any case, and the old version and 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.860
 winter version 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.810
 they are absolutely analogous to the principle 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:57.319
 flow because it is used here 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.730
 here is suede leather here is this 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:04.790
 models there are two more vent 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:07.940
 the holes in this shoe model are very 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:12.470
 good ankle support we see it 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:14.299
 here is double protection 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.190
 here with the help of such straps 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:20.120
 well enough firstly allows 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:22.340
 mobile joint ankle move 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.190
 inside and on the other hand it foreshadows 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:31.640
 here is overstretching 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:34.070
 and increased movement of the joints if 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:36.890
 look here is extraordinary 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:39.620
 wide sock it all happens in 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:41.990
 conceptual version of minimalist 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.669
 would because fingers should have 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.780
 certain movement they must 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:46.520
 to diverge because to us 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.460
 physiologically do not walk in such 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.500
 condition we must separate our pairs 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:55.570
 fingers while walking because each 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:58.430
 each toe muscle acts 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:59.470
 according to biomechanics 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:04.780
 of the body 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:07.180
 our body is special and distinctive 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.600
 feature of this deduced the fact that 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:12.280
 the sole here is almost completely 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.210
 flat if we turn here to this 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.710
 chart 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:20.520
 here we will see that the standard 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:26.670
 it was supposed to go millimeter 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:31.620
 lifting volume of the model 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:31.620
 101 and 102 is only 

00:05:35.559 --> 00:05:42.529
 not visible here of course but inside 

00:05:39.499 --> 00:05:46.369
 is a kind of foam 

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:50.949
 call forms which allows you to reduce 

00:05:46.369 --> 00:05:54.860
 load load shock time 

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:58.879
 motion geyser walk it extinguishes 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:00.069
 certain load while driving 

00:05:58.879 --> 00:06:02.569
 insole 

00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:05.329
 very thin is only 5 

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:07.939
 millimeters she like u unlike 

00:06:05.329 --> 00:06:10.279
 there are no other models of linen on 

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:12.769
 load reduction as I said this 

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:19.299
 function to take that foam which 

00:06:12.769 --> 00:06:24.529
 is located inside the sole of this insole 

00:06:19.299 --> 00:06:27.919
 normal function of controlling moisture and breathing 

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:29.360
 inside during class but also look 

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:31.399
 by itself composition he too on 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.869
 maximum physiological bends 

00:06:31.399 --> 00:06:34.239
 probably not visible but he is completely 

00:06:32.869 --> 00:06:40.819
 fits 

00:06:34.239 --> 00:06:43.389
 taking the form to step model models this 

00:06:40.819 --> 00:06:44.769
 Yuli done great because 

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:47.779
 strength 

00:06:44.769 --> 00:06:49.729
 speaks for itself if you look 

00:06:47.779 --> 00:06:53.019
 Carefully here and on this I asked 

00:06:49.729 --> 00:06:56.869
 stitching seams here these 

00:06:53.019 --> 00:07:00.249
 supporting laces holes they 

00:06:56.869 --> 00:07:02.239
 made of durable metal in itself 

00:07:00.249 --> 00:07:04.419
 shoe construction 

00:07:02.239 --> 00:07:06.569
 how would other trees 

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:08.939
 suggests that not even 

00:07:06.569 --> 00:07:11.429
 classified as water resistant 

00:07:08.939 --> 00:07:14.610
 shoes she does not allow excess moisture 

00:07:11.429 --> 00:07:18.089
 get inside and because the tongue he 

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:21.029
 completely stitched from the part that 

00:07:18.089 --> 00:07:24.389
 fit ankle height like 

00:07:21.029 --> 00:07:26.999
 ordinary ordinary military shoes 8 inches 

00:07:24.389 --> 00:07:30.709
 makes up that's all i'm 

00:07:26.999 --> 00:07:30.709
 I wanted to say thank you for your attention
