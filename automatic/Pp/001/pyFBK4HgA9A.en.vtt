temperature<00:01:51.440> now<00:01:51.769> that<00:01:52.670> is<00:01:52.910> very<00:01:53.269> important

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
temperature now that is very important

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.469 
temperature now that is very important
to<00:01:53.840> me<00:01:54.039> because<00:01:55.039> it<00:01:55.280> means<00:01:55.519> you've<00:01:55.940> got<00:01:56.119> you<00:01:56.239> so

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
to me because it means you've got you so

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.109 
to me because it means you've got you so
much<00:01:56.720> less<00:01:57.560> risk<00:01:57.890> of<00:01:58.099> burning<00:01:58.670> your<00:01:58.879> food

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
much less risk of burning your food

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.240 
much less risk of burning your food
obviously<00:01:59.780> when<00:02:00.470> you're<00:02:00.560> cooking<00:02:00.739> now<00:02:01.069> and

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
obviously when you're cooking now and

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.089 
obviously when you're cooking now and
then<00:02:01.369> you<00:02:01.399> get<00:02:01.729> a<00:02:01.789> little<00:02:02.030> bit<00:02:02.179> of<00:02:02.239> splatter

00:02:03.089 --> 00:02:03.099 
then you get a little bit of splatter

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:06.820 
then you get a little bit of splatter
but<00:02:04.099> the<00:02:04.280> other<00:02:04.399> great<00:02:04.640> thing<00:02:04.700> is<00:02:05.110> this<00:02:06.110> hob<00:02:06.319> is

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
but the other great thing is this hob is

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.600 
but the other great thing is this hob is
really<00:02:07.340> easy<00:02:07.519> to<00:02:07.789> clean<00:02:08.030> easy<00:02:08.300> as<00:02:09.289> that<00:02:09.610> time

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
really easy to clean easy as that time

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.340 
really easy to clean easy as that time
to<00:02:10.789> switch<00:02:10.879> this<00:02:11.120> off

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
to switch this off

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.010 
to switch this off
and<00:02:12.800> this<00:02:13.760> mission<00:02:14.120> now<00:02:14.240> just<00:02:14.540> has<00:02:14.630> to<00:02:14.780> cool

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
and this mission now just has to cool

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.309 
and this mission now just has to cool
down<00:02:15.340> about<00:02:16.340> 10<00:02:16.580> minutes

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.369 

Craig's<00:02:20.980> on<00:02:21.159> my<00:02:21.249> porch<00:02:21.549> admixture<00:02:22.379> nicely

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:23.379 
Craig's on my porch admixture nicely

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:28.110 
Craig's on my porch admixture nicely
cool<00:02:23.590> down<00:02:25.650> perfect<00:02:26.650> to<00:02:27.340> put<00:02:27.489> into<00:02:27.670> my<00:02:27.879> braid

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
cool down perfect to put into my braid

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.720 
cool down perfect to put into my braid
but<00:02:28.299> first<00:02:28.599> I<00:02:28.959> want<00:02:29.889> to<00:02:29.950> roll<00:02:30.129> it<00:02:30.159> nice<00:02:30.459> and

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
but first I want to roll it nice and

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.330 
but first I want to roll it nice and
flat<00:02:31.030> by<00:02:31.900> doing<00:02:32.230> this<00:02:32.260> I'm<00:02:32.650> making<00:02:33.069> the<00:02:33.159> bread

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
flat by doing this I'm making the bread

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.550 
flat by doing this I'm making the bread
less<00:02:33.579> porous<00:02:33.909> so<00:02:34.510> it<00:02:34.810> will<00:02:34.959> really<00:02:35.170> keep<00:02:35.499> that

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
less porous so it will really keep that

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.039 
less porous so it will really keep that
filling<00:02:36.129> in<00:02:36.340> there<00:02:36.549> now<00:02:37.239> there's<00:02:37.750> a<00:02:37.840> lot<00:02:38.019> of

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
filling in there now there's a lot of

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:39.750 
filling in there now there's a lot of
people<00:02:38.379> out<00:02:38.500> there<00:02:38.530> that<00:02:38.920> prefer<00:02:39.340> their<00:02:39.519> crush

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
people out there that prefer their crush

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.599 
people out there that prefer their crush
but<00:02:40.480> for<00:02:40.689> this<00:02:40.810> recipe<00:02:41.109> I<00:02:41.500> prefer<00:02:41.920> to<00:02:42.129> cut<00:02:42.430> them

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:42.609 
but for this recipe I prefer to cut them

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:45.000 
but for this recipe I prefer to cut them
off<00:02:42.730> because<00:02:43.629> what<00:02:43.900> it<00:02:43.989> leaves<00:02:44.260> you<00:02:44.500> with<00:02:44.709> is

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
off because what it leaves you with is

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.789 
off because what it leaves you with is
these<00:02:45.419> perfect<00:02:46.419> little<00:02:46.569> squares<00:02:46.810> which<00:02:47.680> I

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
these perfect little squares which I

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:50.039 
these perfect little squares which I
think<00:02:48.010> will<00:02:48.129> make<00:02:48.280> it<00:02:48.430> easier<00:02:48.879> once<00:02:49.599> I<00:02:49.749> start

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
think will make it easier once I start

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:53.309 
think will make it easier once I start
to<00:02:50.290> fold<00:02:50.560> them<00:02:50.709> and<00:02:50.859> to<00:02:51.099> close<00:02:51.340> them<00:02:51.519> down

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
to fold them and to close them down

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:56.670 
to fold them and to close them down
my<00:02:54.280> bread<00:02:54.519> is<00:02:54.549> done<00:02:54.900> now<00:02:55.900> just<00:02:56.170> to<00:02:56.319> preheat<00:02:56.590> my

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
my bread is done now just to preheat my

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.750 
my bread is done now just to preheat my
oil<00:02:57.359> just<00:02:58.359> a<00:02:58.510> medium-high<00:02:59.019> heat<00:02:59.049> and<00:02:59.639> now<00:03:00.639> I'm

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
oil just a medium-high heat and now I'm

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.720 
oil just a medium-high heat and now I'm
going<00:03:00.939> to<00:03:01.030> just<00:03:01.739> start<00:03:02.739> by<00:03:02.980> putting<00:03:03.249> some<00:03:03.700> in

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
going to just start by putting some in

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.619 
going to just start by putting some in
the<00:03:03.999> middle<00:03:04.269> you<00:03:05.139> don't<00:03:05.319> overfill<00:03:05.950> it<00:03:06.629> I'm

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:07.629 
the middle you don't overfill it I'm

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:10.379 
the middle you don't overfill it I'm
using<00:03:07.900> some<00:03:08.139> water<00:03:08.409> this<00:03:09.370> all<00:03:09.639> along<00:03:10.209> the

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:10.389 
using some water this all along the

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:13.890 
using some water this all along the
edges<00:03:10.569> like<00:03:10.930> so<00:03:11.200> and<00:03:11.469> then<00:03:12.250> just<00:03:12.599> push<00:03:13.599> down<00:03:13.629> on

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
edges like so and then just push down on

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.440 
edges like so and then just push down on
the<00:03:14.139> edges<00:03:14.469> like<00:03:14.650> that<00:03:14.859> so<00:03:15.819> now<00:03:16.000> what<00:03:16.209> I<00:03:16.239> want

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
the edges like that so now what I want

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.240 
the edges like that so now what I want
to<00:03:16.510> do<00:03:16.629> is<00:03:16.659> just<00:03:16.810> from<00:03:17.379> them<00:03:18.060> one<00:03:19.060> egg<00:03:20.159> give<00:03:21.159> it

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
to do is just from them one egg give it

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.569 
to do is just from them one egg give it
a<00:03:21.310> quick<00:03:21.430> stir<00:03:22.409> up<00:03:23.409> my<00:03:23.590> little<00:03:23.769> parcel<00:03:24.340> into

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
a quick stir up my little parcel into

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.729 
a quick stir up my little parcel into
the<00:03:24.669> egg<00:03:24.849> and<00:03:25.150> then<00:03:25.989> straight<00:03:26.439> into<00:03:26.469> the

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
the egg and then straight into the

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.300 
the egg and then straight into the
breadcrumbs<00:03:27.340> and<00:03:28.060> that's<00:03:29.019> it<00:03:29.200> so<00:03:29.859> let's

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
breadcrumbs and that's it so let's

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.309 
breadcrumbs and that's it so let's
quickly<00:03:30.489> check<00:03:30.730> my<00:03:31.389> oil<00:03:31.419> that<00:03:31.900> I've<00:03:32.019> put<00:03:32.290> on

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
quickly check my oil that I've put on

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:34.110 
quickly check my oil that I've put on
earlier<00:03:32.739> so<00:03:33.010> I'm<00:03:33.189> making<00:03:33.459> a<00:03:33.639> little<00:03:33.790> ball

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
earlier so I'm making a little ball

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.089 
earlier so I'm making a little ball
using<00:03:34.930> some<00:03:35.230> of<00:03:35.260> the<00:03:35.439> leftover<00:03:35.590> bread

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:36.099 
using some of the leftover bread

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:39.479 
using some of the leftover bread
straight<00:03:36.879> into<00:03:37.209> my<00:03:37.810> oil<00:03:38.069> so<00:03:39.069> that's<00:03:39.310> what<00:03:39.459> I

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
straight into my oil so that's what I

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.159 
straight into my oil so that's what I
want<00:03:39.730> immediately<00:03:40.269> when<00:03:40.419> it<00:03:40.540> eats<00:03:40.689> the<00:03:40.840> oil<00:03:41.019> it

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:41.169 
want immediately when it eats the oil it

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:44.220 
want immediately when it eats the oil it
starts<00:03:41.500> to<00:03:41.620> try<00:03:41.829> and<00:03:42.099> it's<00:03:42.989> gradually<00:03:43.989> getting

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
starts to try and it's gradually getting

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.009 
starts to try and it's gradually getting
some<00:03:44.530> color<00:03:44.709> it<00:03:45.159> doesn't<00:03:45.459> just<00:03:45.489> start<00:03:46.359> to<00:03:46.569> go

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
some color it doesn't just start to go

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:48.750 
some color it doesn't just start to go
dark<00:03:47.379> brown<00:03:47.680> all<00:03:47.919> of<00:03:48.040> a<00:03:48.099> sudden<00:03:48.129> so<00:03:48.549> that's

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
dark brown all of a sudden so that's

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.339 
dark brown all of a sudden so that's
perfect<00:03:49.379> see<00:03:50.400> straight<00:03:51.400> in<00:03:51.579> there<00:03:52.349> don't

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:53.349 
perfect see straight in there don't

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:55.379 
perfect see straight in there don't
crowd<00:03:53.590> your<00:03:53.739> pan<00:03:54.069> for<00:03:54.639> your<00:03:54.819> pots<00:03:55.060> whatever

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:55.389 
crowd your pan for your pots whatever

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:57.119 
crowd your pan for your pots whatever
you<00:03:55.540> using<00:03:55.870> and<00:03:56.049> I<00:03:56.260> think<00:03:56.379> they<00:03:56.680> should<00:03:56.889> be<00:03:57.040> in

00:03:57.119 --> 00:03:57.129 
you using and I think they should be in

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:00.270
