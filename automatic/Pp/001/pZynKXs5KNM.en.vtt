quite reminiscent of the ankylosaurus

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:16.499 
quite reminiscent of the ankylosaurus
that<00:01:12.850> we<00:01:12.970> see<00:01:13.270> in<00:01:13.840> Jurassic<00:01:14.470> Park<00:01:14.740> 3<00:01:15.420> just<00:01:16.420> a

little bit and actually the ankylosaurus

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:21.090 
little bit and actually the ankylosaurus
doesn't<00:01:19.840> have<00:01:19.990> a<00:01:20.020> big<00:01:20.200> role<00:01:20.439> in<00:01:20.469> the<00:01:20.770> film<00:01:20.979> he

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
doesn't have a big role in the film he

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.830 
doesn't have a big role in the film he
just<00:01:21.280> kind<00:01:21.429> of<00:01:21.460> saunters<00:01:21.939> by<00:01:22.179> in<00:01:22.359> a<00:01:22.420> few<00:01:22.600> shots

starting<00:01:33.130> off<00:01:33.280> with<00:01:33.310> the<00:01:33.639> head<00:01:33.850> you<00:01:34.420> can<00:01:34.600> see

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
starting off with the head you can see

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.569 
starting off with the head you can see
straight<00:01:35.109> away<00:01:35.229> that<00:01:35.350> this<00:01:35.649> Papo<00:01:36.100> dinosaur

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:36.579

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
and usually I prefer the dinosaurs to

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.800 
and usually I prefer the dinosaurs to
have<00:01:41.859> like<00:01:42.069> a<00:01:42.100> matte<00:01:42.429> finish<00:01:42.850> but<00:01:43.509> it's<00:01:43.659> not

have like a matte finish but it's not
too<00:01:44.020> much<00:01:44.200> of<00:01:44.409> a<00:01:44.499> gripe<00:01:44.709> because<00:01:45.069> the<00:01:45.219> paint

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:45.789 
too much of a gripe because the paint

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:47.940 
too much of a gripe because the paint

unfortunately the

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.700 
unfortunately the
always<00:04:38.440> not<00:04:38.650> articulated<00:04:40.020> so<00:04:41.020> you<00:04:41.080> can't<00:04:41.350> open

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
always not articulated so you can't open

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.380 
always not articulated so you can't open
and<00:04:41.830> close<00:04:42.040> the<00:04:42.250> mouth<00:04:42.280> and<00:04:43.000> although<00:04:43.120> there

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390 
and close the mouth and although there

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.180 
and close the mouth and although there
is<00:04:43.510> a<00:04:43.540> seam<00:04:43.870> for<00:04:44.110> the<00:04:44.230> head<00:04:44.410> Derry<00:04:44.680> does<00:04:44.980> not

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
is a seam for the head Derry does not

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.020 
is a seam for the head Derry does not
turn<00:04:45.780> and<00:04:46.780> neither<00:04:46.960> do<00:04:47.140> any<00:04:47.290> of<00:04:47.470> the<00:04:47.590> legs<00:04:48.030> but

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
turn and neither do any of the legs but

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.460 
turn and neither do any of the legs but
we've<00:04:49.180> come<00:04:49.330> to<00:04:49.480> expect<00:04:49.690> that<00:04:49.960> from<00:04:50.080> Papa

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
we've come to expect that from Papa

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:51.870 
we've come to expect that from Papa
because<00:04:50.770> we're<00:04:50.920> getting<00:04:51.010> such<00:04:51.400> a<00:04:51.430> quality

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
because we're getting such a quality

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.780 
because we're getting such a quality
figure<00:04:52.710> that<00:04:53.710> we<00:04:53.830> don't<00:04:54.010> expect<00:04:54.340> too<00:04:54.610> much

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:54.790 
figure that we don't expect too much

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.300 
figure that we don't expect too much
articulation<00:04:55.680> okay<00:04:56.680> so<00:04:56.740> it's<00:04:57.100> size

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
articulation okay so it's size

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.220 
articulation okay so it's size
comparison<00:04:57.970> time<00:04:58.210> let's<00:04:58.420> bring<00:04:58.630> in<00:04:58.810> the<00:04:58.900> prop

00:04:59.220 --> 00:04:59.230 
comparison time let's bring in the prop

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.290 
comparison time let's bring in the prop

Saurus<00:05:42.940> I<00:05:43.150> think<00:05:43.660> this<00:05:43.750> is<00:05:43.870> a<00:05:43.900> tremendously

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 
Saurus I think this is a tremendously

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.860 
Saurus I think this is a tremendously
detailed<00:05:45.400> figure<00:05:45.850> the<00:05:46.270> only<00:05:46.360> thing<00:05:46.690> that<00:05:46.840> I

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:46.870 
detailed figure the only thing that I

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:48.570 
detailed figure the only thing that I
feel<00:05:47.230> let<00:05:47.560> sit<00:05:47.770> down<00:05:47.950> a<00:05:47.980> little<00:05:48.190> bit<00:05:48.340> is<00:05:48.460> the

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 
feel let sit down a little bit is the

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.340 
feel let sit down a little bit is the
fact<00:05:48.790> that<00:05:48.880> the<00:05:49.060> skin<00:05:49.270> is<00:05:49.540> sort<00:05:50.020> of<00:05:50.050> like<00:05:50.170> this

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:50.350 
fact that the skin is sort of like this

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.730 
fact that the skin is sort of like this
even<00:05:50.710> gloss<00:05:51.040> all<00:05:51.340> over<00:05:52.020> but<00:05:53.020> I<00:05:53.050> really<00:05:53.560> love

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:53.740 
even gloss all over but I really love

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:54.970 
the attention to detail that they've

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:56.310
