we have to not Nick any of the balls as
well<00:00:39.140> should<00:00:40.140> have<00:00:40.200> come<00:00:40.440> all<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.680> way<00:00:40.710> around

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
well should have come all the way around

well should have come all the way around
should<00:00:41.640> have<00:00:41.820> come<00:00:42.360> out<00:00:42.540> in<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.870> middle<00:00:43.260> of

should have come out in the middle of
the<00:00:44.080> work<00:00:44.290> but<00:00:44.530> we<00:00:44.620> came<00:00:44.770> out<00:00:44.920> on<00:00:44.950> the<00:00:45.070> corner

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
the work but we came out on the corner

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.050 
the work but we came out on the corner
next<00:00:47.440> we<00:00:47.650> have<00:00:47.770> these<00:00:47.920> barrels<00:00:48.250> and<00:00:48.730> we<00:00:48.760> have

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:49.060 
next we have these barrels and we have

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.720 
next we have these barrels and we have
to<00:00:49.239> weave<00:00:49.510> a<00:00:49.540> backward<00:00:50.500> pattern<00:00:51.100> through<00:00:51.580> the

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
to weave a backward pattern through the

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.770 
to weave a backward pattern through the
barrels<00:00:54.090> Jesse<00:00:55.090> and<00:00:55.210> I<00:00:55.239> are<00:00:55.270> turning<00:00:55.570> around

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
barrels Jesse and I are turning around

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:05.720 
barrels Jesse and I are turning around
to<00:00:56.170> set<00:00:56.470> this<00:00:56.650> up

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:05.730 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.100 

it's<00:01:06.090> getting<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.360> little<00:01:06.510> close<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.960> that

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
it's getting a little close to that

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.460 
it's getting a little close to that
white<00:01:07.320> barrel<00:01:07.620> but<00:01:07.890> she<00:01:08.720> negotiated<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:09.840> very

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
white barrel but she negotiated it very

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.710 
white barrel but she negotiated it very
well

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.710 

when<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:15.750> little<00:01:16.080> white<00:01:16.290> their<00:01:18.860> object<00:01:19.860> is<00:01:20.010> to

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
when a little white their object is to

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.620 
when a little white their object is to
enter<00:01:21.720> every<00:01:22.170> obstacle<00:01:22.710> straight<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.640> leave

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
enter every obstacle straight and leave

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.720 
enter every obstacle straight and leave
it<00:01:24.840> going<00:01:25.320> straight<00:01:25.710> so<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:26.070> straighten<00:01:26.490> her<00:01:26.550> up

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:26.730 
it going straight so I straighten her up

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.370 
it going straight so I straighten her up
here

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.050 

there's<00:01:30.380> a<00:01:30.470> cone<00:01:30.710> just<00:01:31.010> outside<00:01:31.490> the<00:01:31.729> camera

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
there's a cone just outside the camera

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.330 
there's a cone just outside the camera
view<00:01:32.450> in<00:01:32.600> the<00:01:32.720> bottom<00:01:33.170> and<00:01:33.440> we<00:01:33.800> have<00:01:33.950> to<00:01:34.100> jog

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
view in the bottom and we have to jog

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:41.410 
view in the bottom and we have to jog
from<00:01:34.670> that<00:01:35.090> cone<00:01:35.650> to<00:01:36.650> the<00:01:36.770> very<00:01:36.979> next<00:01:37.310> cone<00:01:40.420> the

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
from that cone to the very next cone the

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.390 
from that cone to the very next cone the
more<00:01:41.600> advanced<00:01:41.869> classes<00:01:42.320> they<00:01:42.710> loped<00:01:43.070> at

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 
more advanced classes they loped at

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.810 
more advanced classes they loped at
section<00:01:44.140> stop<00:01:45.140> at<00:01:45.350> that<00:01:45.500> cone<00:01:45.860> and<00:01:46.430> now<00:01:46.580> we'll

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
section stop at that cone and now we'll

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.420 
section stop at that cone and now we'll
do<00:01:47.000> a<00:01:47.030> left<00:01:47.479> side<00:01:48.110> pass<00:01:48.500> where<00:01:49.040> she<00:01:49.220> moves

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
do a left side pass where she moves

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.690 
do a left side pass where she moves
sideways<00:01:50.500> and<00:01:51.500> that<00:01:51.710> pole<00:01:52.040> is<00:01:52.220> between<00:01:52.580> her

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
sideways and that pole is between her

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.340 
sideways and that pole is between her
front<00:01:52.970> legs<00:01:53.180> and<00:01:53.360> her<00:01:53.509> back<00:01:53.690> legs<00:01:55.960> she<00:01:56.960> stops

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
front legs and her back legs she stops

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.620 
front legs and her back legs she stops
and<00:01:57.920> then<00:01:58.130> we<00:01:58.250> have<00:01:58.369> to<00:01:58.550> cross<00:01:58.850> that<00:01:58.880> wooden

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
and then we have to cross that wooden

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.499 
and then we have to cross that wooden
bridge<00:02:00.190> this<00:02:01.190> makes<00:02:01.460> a<00:02:01.580> big<00:02:01.759> noise<00:02:01.789> when<00:02:02.360> you

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
bridge this makes a big noise when you

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:05.590 
bridge this makes a big noise when you
clunk<00:02:02.840> over<00:02:03.200> it<00:02:03.320> and<00:02:03.860> then<00:02:04.610> we<00:02:04.789> trot<00:02:05.149> to<00:02:05.479> the

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
clunk over it and then we trot to the

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.969 
clunk over it and then we trot to the
next<00:02:06.020> cone<00:02:07.989> because<00:02:08.989> it<00:02:09.200> gets<00:02:09.350> a<00:02:09.410> little<00:02:09.649> bit

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
next cone because it gets a little bit

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.650 
next cone because it gets a little bit
spooked<00:02:10.310> that's<00:02:10.789> the<00:02:11.030> judge<00:02:11.270> right<00:02:11.480> there

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
spooked that's the judge right there

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.440 
spooked that's the judge right there
sitting<00:02:12.020> in<00:02:12.110> the<00:02:12.230> chair<00:02:12.580> just<00:02:13.580> Jesse's

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
sitting in the chair just Jesse's

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.390 
sitting in the chair just Jesse's
checking<00:02:14.930> her<00:02:15.020> out<00:02:16.600> stop<00:02:17.600> at<00:02:17.810> this<00:02:18.020> cone<00:02:18.400> and

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
checking her out stop at this cone and

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.320 
checking her out stop at this cone and
then<00:02:19.580> the<00:02:19.730> last<00:02:19.940> obstacle<00:02:20.450> is<00:02:20.840> a<00:02:20.870> rope<00:02:21.170> gait

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
then the last obstacle is a rope gait

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.810 
then the last obstacle is a rope gait
it's<00:02:23.330> called<00:02:23.630> a<00:02:23.750> left<00:02:24.080> of<00:02:24.440> course<00:02:24.830> so

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:33.660 

start<00:02:28.820> off<00:02:28.970> square

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:40.990 

pick<00:02:34.670> up<00:02:34.850> the<00:02:35.000> rope<00:02:35.180> with<00:02:35.420> my<00:02:35.540> left<00:02:35.840> hand<00:02:40.000> push

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
pick up the rope with my left hand push

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.660 
pick up the rope with my left hand push
Jessie<00:02:41.600> through

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.050 

and<00:02:48.670> latch<00:02:49.120> the<00:02:49.420> gate<00:02:50.430> not<00:02:51.430> to<00:02:51.700> the<00:02:51.820> judge<00:02:52.030> that

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
and latch the gate not to the judge that

00:02:52.060 --> 00:03:01.920 
and latch the gate not to the judge that
we're<00:02:52.390> finished<00:02:53.790> and<00:02:54.790> get<00:02:55.120> the<00:02:55.240> heck<00:02:55.360> out

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:11.460 

this<00:03:02.930> is<00:03:03.080> Rene's<00:03:03.739> run<00:03:06.640> with<00:03:07.640> dusty

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.320 

he'd<00:03:11.980> been<00:03:12.160> nicking<00:03:12.430> those<00:03:12.730> boards<00:03:13.180> all

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
he'd been nicking those boards all
