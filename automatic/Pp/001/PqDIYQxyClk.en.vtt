get into it what I do really didn't like
about<00:04:27.760> both<00:04:28.030> of<00:04:28.060> these<00:04:28.300> films<00:04:28.630> was<00:04:29.260> that<00:04:29.380> I

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
about both of these films was that I

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.500 
about both of these films was that I
feel<00:04:29.680> like<00:04:29.770> it<00:04:29.890> took<00:04:30.070> a<00:04:30.130> little<00:04:30.610> bit<00:04:31.030> too<00:04:31.300> long

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
feel like it took a little bit too long

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.780 
feel like it took a little bit too long
to<00:04:31.720> get<00:04:31.840> going<00:04:32.050> I<00:04:32.230> feel<00:04:32.470> the<00:04:33.070> kind<00:04:33.310> of<00:04:33.400> started

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
to get going I feel the kind of started

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.220 
to get going I feel the kind of started
repeating<00:04:34.120> out<00:04:34.450> of<00:04:34.570> the<00:04:34.660> same<00:04:34.870> jokes

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.230 
repeating out of the same jokes

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.110 
repeating out of the same jokes
especially<00:04:35.440> the<00:04:35.770> second<00:04:36.160> film<00:04:36.370> and<00:04:36.550> then<00:04:36.970> they

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
especially the second film and then they

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.400 
especially the second film and then they
would<00:04:37.240> get<00:04:37.360> to<00:04:37.480> the<00:04:37.570> storyline<00:04:37.840> bullet<00:04:38.230> that's

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
would get to the storyline bullet that's

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:39.900 
would get to the storyline bullet that's
a<00:04:38.470> little<00:04:38.740> nip<00:04:38.920> it<00:04:39.100> but<00:04:39.220> it<00:04:39.310> kind<00:04:39.460> of<00:04:39.490> bothered

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
a little nip it but it kind of bothered

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.550 
a little nip it but it kind of bothered
me<00:04:39.970> a<00:04:40.090> little<00:04:40.270> but<00:04:40.600> I'm<00:04:40.750> just<00:04:40.960> saying<00:04:41.230> that

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
me a little but I'm just saying that

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.380 
me a little but I'm just saying that
because<00:04:42.190> I<00:04:42.490> just<00:04:42.790> kind<00:04:43.000> of<00:04:43.030> bothered<00:04:43.330> me

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390 
because I just kind of bothered me

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:44.970 
because I just kind of bothered me
nothing<00:04:43.900> every<00:04:44.050> we<00:04:44.140> didn't<00:04:44.320> like<00:04:44.410> about<00:04:44.590> the

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:44.980 
nothing every we didn't like about the

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.100 
nothing every we didn't like about the
film<00:04:45.760> was<00:04:45.970> that<00:04:46.090> the<00:04:46.360> villains<00:04:46.750> they<00:04:46.930> never

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
film was that the villains they never

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.230 
film was that the villains they never
really<00:04:47.290> seemed<00:04:47.620> a<00:04:47.710> menacing<00:04:48.160> to<00:04:48.310> me<00:04:48.460> that<00:04:48.850> that

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
really seemed a menacing to me that that

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.940 
really seemed a menacing to me that that
they<00:04:49.810> really<00:04:49.990> were<00:04:50.170> like<00:04:50.380> a<00:04:50.410> really<00:04:50.680> big

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
they really were like a really big

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.020 
they really were like a really big
threat<00:04:51.250> that<00:04:51.400> they<00:04:51.460> really<00:04:51.610> couldn't<00:04:51.850> get

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
threat that they really couldn't get

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.750 
threat that they really couldn't get
away<00:04:52.150> from<00:04:52.360> especially<00:04:53.320> in<00:04:53.560> the<00:04:53.650> first<00:04:54.490> though

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760 
away from especially in the first though

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:55.800 
away from especially in the first though
I<00:04:54.790> didn't<00:04:55.000> really<00:04:55.090> think<00:04:55.210> that<00:04:55.360> he<00:04:55.540> was<00:04:55.630> much

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
I didn't really think that he was much

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:56.940 
I didn't really think that he was much
of<00:04:55.840> a<00:04:55.990> threat<00:04:56.140> they<00:04:56.350> could<00:04:56.500> have<00:04:56.590> just<00:04:56.620> snuck

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
of a threat they could have just snuck

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.460 
of a threat they could have just snuck
out<00:04:57.160> and<00:04:57.190> stuff<00:04:57.580> but<00:04:57.760> still<00:04:58.030> nitpick<00:04:58.930> nothing

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
out and stuff but still nitpick nothing

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.950 
out and stuff but still nitpick nothing
