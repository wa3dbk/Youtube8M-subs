just<00:01:35.850> like<00:01:36.030> man<00:01:36.299> ops<00:01:36.509> duel<00:01:37.259> bladers<00:01:37.650> are

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
just like man ops duel bladers are

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.200 
just like man ops duel bladers are
pretty<00:01:38.040> good<00:01:38.220> mobber<00:01:38.520> so<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:38.909> could<00:01:39.090> definitely

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
pretty good mobber so I could definitely

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.149 
pretty good mobber so I could definitely
see<00:01:39.570> why<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.780> duel<00:01:40.079> blader<00:01:40.350> made<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:40.979> top

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
see why a duel blader made it to the top

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.310 
see why a duel blader made it to the top
5<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.850> he's<00:01:42.150> not<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.450> only<00:01:42.600> duel<00:01:42.899> later<00:01:43.140> to

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
5 and he's not the only duel later to

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.649 
5 and he's not the only duel later to
make<00:01:43.439> it<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.799> top<00:01:44.040> 5<00:01:44.340> coming<00:01:45.030> in<00:01:45.119> number<00:01:45.420> 2

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
make it to the top 5 coming in number 2

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.810 
make it to the top 5 coming in number 2

just a very good mob in class and I

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.600 
just a very good mob in class and I
could<00:02:32.020> definitely<00:02:32.140> see<00:02:32.530> why<00:02:32.680> Kyra<00:02:33.010> is<00:02:33.190> number

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610

top five and good job to all you players
above<00:02:37.959> level<00:02:38.260> 200<00:02:38.860> it<00:02:39.070> definitely<00:02:39.520> takes<00:02:39.670> some

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
above level 200 it definitely takes some

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.090 
above level 200 it definitely takes some
serious<00:02:40.060> dedication<00:02:40.450> to<00:02:40.930> level<00:02:41.230> past<00:02:41.470> 200

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
serious dedication to level past 200

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.130 
serious dedication to level past 200
because<00:02:42.520> it<00:02:42.730> just<00:02:43.000> gets<00:02:43.180> so<00:02:43.510> slow<00:02:43.900> and

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
because it just gets so slow and

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.440 
because it just gets so slow and
especially<00:02:44.410> after<00:02:44.820> 209<00:02:45.820> when<00:02:46.120> you<00:02:46.209> start

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
especially after 209 when you start

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.810 
especially after 209 when you start
getting<00:02:46.540> reduced<00:02:46.989> exp<00:02:47.530> from<00:02:47.739> golems<00:02:48.280> it<00:02:48.610> just

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
getting reduced exp from golems it just

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.729 
getting reduced exp from golems it just
gets<00:02:49.030> very<00:02:49.390> hard<00:02:49.720> to<00:02:49.870> train<00:02:50.140> as<00:02:50.470> you<00:02:50.650> should

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
gets very hard to train as you should

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.020 
gets very hard to train as you should
can<00:02:50.830> be<00:02:50.920> really<00:02:51.190> hard<00:02:51.370> for<00:02:51.430> these<00:02:51.640> guys<00:02:51.790> to

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
can be really hard for these guys to

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.280 
can be really hard for these guys to
keep<00:02:52.180> leveling<00:02:52.390> up<00:02:52.720> because<00:02:52.989> there<00:02:53.170> isn't

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
keep leveling up because there isn't

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.440 
keep leveling up because there isn't
really<00:02:53.530> much<00:02:53.650> motivation<00:02:54.580> to<00:02:54.760> keep<00:02:54.910> going

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
really much motivation to keep going

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.960 
really much motivation to keep going
because<00:02:55.720> the<00:02:56.290> exp<00:02:56.709> is<00:02:56.769> just<00:02:57.010> so<00:02:57.220> slow<00:02:57.670> you're

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
because the exp is just so slow you're

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.360 
because the exp is just so slow you're
gonna<00:02:58.090> be<00:02:58.239> like<00:02:58.360> training<00:02:58.750> all<00:02:59.140> day<00:02:59.170> for<00:02:59.890> just

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
gonna be like training all day for just

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:01.860 
gonna be like training all day for just
a<00:03:00.519> few<00:03:00.730> percent<00:03:01.209> and<00:03:01.420> there<00:03:01.540> isn't<00:03:01.780> really

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
a few percent and there isn't really

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.990 
a few percent and there isn't really
much<00:03:02.019> endgame<00:03:02.739> content<00:03:03.040> that<00:03:03.550> makes<00:03:03.700> it<00:03:03.820> worth

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
much endgame content that makes it worth

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.320 
much endgame content that makes it worth
leveling<00:03:04.450> past<00:03:04.810> 200<00:03:05.500> basically<00:03:06.190> level<00:03:06.370> 250

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
leveling past 200 basically level 250

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.840 
leveling past 200 basically level 250
and<00:03:07.540> 200<00:03:08.200> if<00:03:08.320> you're<00:03:08.470> not<00:03:08.620> a<00:03:08.650> xenon<00:03:09.130> is<00:03:09.400> exactly

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
and 200 if you're not a xenon is exactly

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.759 
and 200 if you're not a xenon is exactly
the<00:03:10.030> same<00:03:10.239> thing<00:03:10.510> you'll<00:03:11.110> be<00:03:11.230> doing<00:03:11.500> the<00:03:11.590> same

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
the same thing you'll be doing the same

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:14.430 
the same thing you'll be doing the same
damage<00:03:12.130> but<00:03:12.760> maybe<00:03:13.060> the<00:03:13.330> level<00:03:13.570> 250<00:03:14.230> I'll<00:03:14.320> have

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
damage but maybe the level 250 I'll have

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.080 
damage but maybe the level 250 I'll have
a<00:03:14.470> bit<00:03:14.769> more<00:03:14.950> HP<00:03:15.100> than<00:03:15.310> you<00:03:15.580> do<00:03:15.730> and<00:03:15.940> that's

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
a bit more HP than you do and that's

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.030 
a bit more HP than you do and that's
about<00:03:16.300> it<00:03:16.510> now<00:03:16.690> in<00:03:16.959> fifth<00:03:17.140> job<00:03:17.440> finally<00:03:17.739> comes

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
about it now in fifth job finally comes

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.590 
about it now in fifth job finally comes
out<00:03:18.160> I'm<00:03:18.370> sure<00:03:18.400> this<00:03:18.700> will<00:03:18.820> all<00:03:18.880> change<00:03:19.360> and

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.729 
out I'm sure this will all change and
it'll<00:03:19.780> definitely<00:03:19.959> be<00:03:20.170> more<00:03:20.470> worthwhile

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
it'll definitely be more worthwhile

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.640
