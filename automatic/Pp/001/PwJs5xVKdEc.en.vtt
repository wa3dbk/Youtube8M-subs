00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 in space hardly be prepared 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.230
 utensils needed and such sharp 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.859
 Knives are in such heights well 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.230
 rather taboo 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.990
 on the other hand, find it here on the earth 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.000
 Your expert use of the cook 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.830
 enjoyment begins when cutting announcing cook 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.779
 experts and the sharper the knives 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.189
 the better but the sharpness alone 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.840
 you do not have to go with these 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.900
 dangerous tools too 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.279
 can deal with the right one 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.590
 Finger skills can be in zero 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.460
 comma nothing this run very small 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.679
 to cut 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.329
 if you think so sounds sounder now 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.980
 be the best then you should 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.980
 take a closer look at the following knives 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.960
 in seven years as a Japanese 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:43.969
 cook even has ithaka even days 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.539
 spent whole year vegetables too 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:46.699
 climb 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:49.699
 then he was allowed to work independently 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:51.769
 work with the super one-sided 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:54.320
 polished profi knife on the 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:55.909
 Back slightly concave worked in 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.769
 one of the best japanese knives 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:00.290
 forge 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:02.839
 kazuki thousand needles means the cutting edge 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.729
 The process in the water will be the salvation 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:07.130
 stripes really stiff like needles 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.320
 the connoisseurs of real japanese cuisine 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:13.479
 this requires discipline and knowledge 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.479
 an uncompromisingly sharp work tool 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:27.920
 in japan what you realize that you 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:34.009
 mean much more careful and also 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:37.130
 lovingly handle it and then 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:41.140
 often said the knife is the soul 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:44.180
 cutting a cook is not 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:48.200
 pre-process of cooking but belongs to 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:50.509
 core of the cooking the super and 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.870
 the yanagida two of the essential 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.640
 Japanese professional knife 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.320
 with a producer from the german 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.480
 messe hochburg solingen has become 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.280
 tomoyuki takada made the 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.100
 German finally to enlighten 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.020
 about real Japanese sound actually 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.000
 it should have been the other way around 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.070
 Giselheid wanted her harder 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.630
 legendary knives in their turn 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.880
 export to japan 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.040
 because the so-called windmill knives 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.350
 are considered unique in solingen 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.480
 look the reason she actually has 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.910
 another trained grinder under 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.070
 contract of 100 years old 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.200
 machines an incomparable bike 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.060
 get the finishing touches 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.860
 Automated knife production of 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:34.210
 great solinger competitor creates so 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:37.960
 no longer grind something by hand like 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:40.990
 I better because I put the blade up 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:43.020
 the wait is thin to see can see 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.190
 but the automat can not 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:50.380
 automatically runs the pawl practically 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:52.670
 sheet can see the blade around here 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.560
 it in exaggerated proportions 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.470
 and I'm looping the blade 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.300
 only down here 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.130
 with the conviction that their knives are the 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.959
 The best and the sharpest ones wanted to be 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.460
 CEO also the Japanese market 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.290
 conquer 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.630
 at a first fair appearance were 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.090
 their products were politely appraised 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.510
 but just with the domestic mass 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.510
 compared to 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.940
 The first visit to Japan ended therefore 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.840
 with a bitter disappointment 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.820
 it was already clear that the sheep the 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.660
 So we really sharp 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.830
 understand 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.920
 at the Japanese 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.890
 So better with the Japanese better 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.120
 not at all to compare 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.380
 Japanese fair have a much higher one 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:40.600
 sharpness as our knife had and 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.250
 of course, that was always the case 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.460
 feeling and coming along with something good and after 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.230
 Japan first steamed a lot 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.660
 disappointment from the entrepreneur 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.150
 That's why she wanted to knit it 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.830
 together with her business partner 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.960
 contacts to the best Japanese sword 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:59.050
 and knives manufacturers with the forge 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:01.630
 so in sakai now a contacts 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.760
 that's how intense and trusting that is 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.440
 with yasuyuki with sumo already to 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.420
 second time one of the best Japanese 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.390
 sheep master his in this country 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.800
 Equal peers visited and almost 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.750
 already a vote of confidence 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.280
 the business partners in germany 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.500
 allowed both the one-sided 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.450
 polished profi knife but also the 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.049
 easier to handle hobby knife 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.049
 to evict 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:29.660
 So if you 're a hobby chef real 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.759
 Japanese knives made of carbon steel 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.680
 I would have liked to use 

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:36.630
 recommend 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:40.080
 Both sides ground knife pointed 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:44.190
 hand press and there you should already 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:46.889
 over 100 euro but not more than 150 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:49.620
 spend euro there they still get 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:51.449
 reasonable knife what you too 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.160
 It should be respectful 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:54.810
 this work tool and a 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.550
 whetstone costs as 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.870
 synthetic or natural stone between 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.240
 50 and 100 euros 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.940
 after work should be done 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.590
 and at most once a month what that 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:08.120
 knife else you need the resulting 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.120
 in any case asserted itself 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:17.120
 should be just loving 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:20.039
 and handle the knife carefully 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:23.069
 and if the setting exists 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:27.020
 you will lovingly handle it like that 

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:27.020
 believe in the virtue of his more fair 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.750
 the sharpness of the knife becomes a 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.180
 reward even if you do not like that 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.970
 disciplined at the exact 90 degree angle 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.350
 cuts like the rule because of it 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:43.310
 the reward is the taste 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:45.840
 that's what the connoisseurs say 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:47.729
 by the sharp cut would just 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.949
 no cells crushed but 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:51.900
 split very thinly and thus remain 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:55.949
 aroma and juices within the 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:57.210
 cut good rosita even then it has 

00:05:55.949 --> 00:05:59.669
 internalized 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:01.740
 the absolute sheep leaves his knife 

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:02.639
 The regime is not just pure and clear 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:05.340
 appearance 

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:07.699
 the sharpness of his knives you can also 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.699
 taste
