couple of different ways that people
will<00:00:28.380> install<00:00:28.710> these<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.189> way<00:00:29.310> I<00:00:29.339> like<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.730> do

will install these the way I like to do

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.550 
will install these the way I like to do
it<00:00:29.910> it's<00:00:30.060> really<00:00:30.119> simple<00:00:30.330> is<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.050> just<00:00:31.349> grab

it it's really simple is to just grab

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.790 
it it's really simple is to just grab
each<00:00:31.830> end<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.279> flex<00:00:32.910> it<00:00:33.150> and<00:00:33.330> start<00:00:34.200> up<00:00:34.410> into

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
each end and flex it and start up into

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.920 
each end and flex it and start up into
this<00:00:34.920> channel<00:00:35.190> first<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.970> then<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.780> back

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
this channel first and then the back

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.860 
this channel first and then the back
channel<00:00:37.260> second<00:00:38.090> once<00:00:39.090> you<00:00:39.210> have<00:00:39.390> both<00:00:39.570> side

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
channel second once you have both side

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.910

channels in grab the center cross it
into<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.370> channel<00:00:44.699> and<00:00:44.730> push<00:00:45.090> it<00:00:45.210> up<00:00:45.890> then

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
into the channel and push it up then

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.709 
into the channel and push it up then
finish<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.399> install<00:00:47.699> by<00:00:47.910> pushing<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:48.390> up<00:00:48.539> and

should<00:00:53.760> roll<00:00:54.059> up<00:00:54.090> really<00:00:54.629> smoothly<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.230> only

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
should roll up really smoothly the only

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.930 
should roll up really smoothly the only
thing<00:00:55.800> we've<00:00:55.920> ever<00:00:56.070> encountered<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.699> when<00:00:56.850> you

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
thing we've ever encountered is when you

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.029 
thing we've ever encountered is when you
have<00:00:57.090> brand<00:00:57.539> new<00:00:57.660> seals<00:00:58.109> all<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.440> way<00:00:58.530> around

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
have brand new seals all the way around

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.040 
have brand new seals all the way around
sometimes<00:00:59.760> this<00:00:59.940> wind<00:01:00.149> wing<00:01:00.300> can<00:01:00.510> shift<00:01:00.809> and

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
sometimes this wind wing can shift and

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.509 
sometimes this wind wing can shift and
there's<00:01:01.199> slight<00:01:01.469> discrepancies<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.309> vans

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:02.519 
there's slight discrepancies and vans

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:04.880 
there's slight discrepancies and vans
one<00:01:03.180> thing<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:03.449> can<00:01:03.750> do<00:01:03.960> is<00:01:04.080> use<00:01:04.230> a<00:01:04.260> ruler<00:01:04.680> if

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
one thing you can do is use a ruler if

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.800 
one thing you can do is use a ruler if
you<00:01:05.010> have<00:01:05.160> a<00:01:05.190> cool<00:01:05.430> tool<00:01:05.640> like<00:01:05.820> this<00:01:06.060> you'll

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
you have a cool tool like this you'll

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.200 
you have a cool tool like this you'll
just<00:01:06.960> slightly<00:01:07.650> spread<00:01:08.550> the<00:01:08.760> channel<00:01:09.150> a

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
just slightly spread the channel a

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.039 
just slightly spread the channel a
little<00:01:09.390> bit<00:01:09.540> along<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.560> window<00:01:11.869> and<00:01:12.869> it'll

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
little bit along the window and it'll

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.749 
little bit along the window and it'll
just<00:01:13.140> kind<00:01:13.350> of<00:01:13.409> seat<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:13.890> deflector<00:01:14.400> in<00:01:14.580> a

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:14.759 
just kind of seat that deflector in a

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:17.480 
just kind of seat that deflector in a
little<00:01:15.150> bit<00:01:15.299> more<00:01:15.509> in<00:01:16.350> extreme<00:01:16.950> cases

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
little bit more in extreme cases

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.219 
little bit more in extreme cases
spreading<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.119> channel<00:01:18.450> isn't<00:01:18.810> enough<00:01:19.049> and

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
spreading the channel isn't enough and

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.899 
spreading the channel isn't enough and
what<00:01:19.439> you<00:01:19.560> need<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.770> do<00:01:19.920> is<00:01:20.159> shape<00:01:20.400> literally<00:01:20.880> a

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
what you need to do is shape literally a

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.880 
what you need to do is shape literally a
millimeter<00:01:21.420> or<00:01:21.600> two<00:01:21.630> off<00:01:21.960> of<00:01:22.110> each<00:01:22.350> end<00:01:22.650> and

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
millimeter or two off of each end and

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.280 
millimeter or two off of each end and
it'll<00:01:23.159> slide<00:01:23.369> right<00:01:23.579> in<00:01:23.840> so<00:01:24.840> that's<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.170> for

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
it'll slide right in so that's it for

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.810 
it'll slide right in so that's it for
this<00:01:25.439> side<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.860> other<00:01:25.890> side<00:01:26.100> installs<00:01:26.700> the

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
this side the other side installs the

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.850 
this side the other side installs the
exact<00:01:27.210> same<00:01:27.450> way<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:28.049> that's<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.439> for<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.710> van

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
exact same way and that's it for the van

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.069 
exact same way and that's it for the van
we'll<00:01:29.070> move<00:01:29.189> on<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.549> year<00:01:29.700> okay<00:01:29.930> so<00:01:30.930> we're

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
we'll move on to the year okay so we're

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.359 
we'll move on to the year okay so we're
installing<00:01:31.229> these<00:01:31.530> on<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.710> Europe<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.189> it's

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
installing these on a Europe and it's

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.679 
installing these on a Europe and it's
really<00:01:32.549> simple<00:01:32.850> we're<00:01:33.119> gonna<00:01:33.210> start<00:01:33.540> in<00:01:33.630> the

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
really simple we're gonna start in the

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.139 
really simple we're gonna start in the
upper<00:01:34.049> right<00:01:34.259> corner<00:01:34.640> bend<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:35.880> make<00:01:36.000> our

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:36.149 
upper right corner bend it and make our

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:44.510 
upper right corner bend it and make our
way<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.450> front

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.980 

so<00:01:45.520> your<00:01:45.700> bands<00:01:45.970> have<00:01:46.150> a<00:01:46.180> sensor<00:01:46.660> in<00:01:46.810> their

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
so your bands have a sensor in their

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.420 
so your bands have a sensor in their
window<00:01:47.320> when<00:01:47.470> you<00:01:47.590> roll<00:01:47.740> the<00:01:47.860> window<00:01:48.160> up<00:01:48.190> if

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
window when you roll the window up if

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.070 
window when you roll the window up if
there's<00:01:48.610> anything<00:01:48.910> in<00:01:49.180> the<00:01:49.300> way<00:01:49.450> before<00:01:49.960> it

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
there's anything in the way before it
