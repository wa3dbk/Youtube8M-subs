00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:24.810
 yes this is what i think 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:29.050
 about love story gone wrong 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:31.630
 I was not all luck from love 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.970
 I'd love you to the moon donated 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.580

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.590
 flower for love I always had a 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:41.770
 big hit hour arcore because it lands 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:44.739
 educated you spoke Latin in the end I was 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:47.020
 happy i was your paladin paladin 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:50.739
 rent in the mind because my love 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:53.440
 for you he was indifferent to all reflecting 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.690
 I say first behind an armor of those who do not 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.120
 ama only wants an adventure 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.340
 an adventure that has become a 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.550
 torment because he was a golden boy 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.920
 but even losing I ask for help from love 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.170
 but you don't always pass me by 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.310
 time becomes larger to i 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.410
 change 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.560
 it made me feel bad by putting on 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.880
 clear what it means to love this is it 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.690
 what I think 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:23.170
 love if with feeling towards behind i 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:25.440
 your glarey marionette looks 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.590
 sincere 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.710
 this is what is near love is not 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:35.370
 blind is the feeling lost behind i 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.300
 your looks for the name for everyone to be 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:40.600
 serious 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:44.140
 for everything you did a drama instead 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:47.020
 inside I shone a flame you were one 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:50.080
 very safe person inside a beast 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:53.350
 but outside I tried a beautiful pure gem 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.990
 to react but I was dead inside after all 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.630
 these lies there was no feeling a 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.030
 feeling that my heart had divided 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.820
 although always the only one with the 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.300
 smile a smile that has flown 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.600
 Street 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:10.240
 maybe the mafia was a real madness and 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.640
 then he always treated us like resins 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.280
 that when he takes you away you give me wine 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.640
 close neighbor this love from ben 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.850

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.100
 weight evaded by love stories without a 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.800
 sense but after all I have you 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:29.430
 given and still weight this is what it is 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.050
 lost love is not only blind 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:36.090
 feeling lost behind your eyes 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:40.570

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:43.900
