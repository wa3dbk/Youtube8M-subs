the cake warehouse today I'm going to
show<00:00:34.329> you<00:00:34.360> how<00:00:34.600> to<00:00:34.660> use<00:00:34.899> the<00:00:35.110> petunia<00:00:35.649> cutter

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:36.520 
show you how to use the petunia cutter

show you how to use the petunia cutter
and<00:00:36.820> mold<00:00:37.030> set<00:00:37.330> from<00:00:37.570> blossom<00:00:37.930> sugar<00:00:38.140> ah<00:00:38.580> I've

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:39.580 
and mold set from blossom sugar ah I've

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.120 
and mold set from blossom sugar ah I've
never<00:00:39.850> done<00:00:40.000> one<00:00:40.030> of<00:00:40.180> these<00:00:40.270> before<00:00:40.330> so<00:00:41.010> I'm<00:00:42.010> a

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.130 
never done one of these before so I'm a

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.650 
never done one of these before so I'm a
complete<00:00:42.430> novice<00:00:42.640> and<00:00:42.910> that's<00:00:43.030> why<00:00:43.150> I<00:00:43.180> show<00:00:43.390> us

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 
complete novice and that's why I show us

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.320 
complete novice and that's why I show us
may<00:00:43.810> do<00:00:44.020> it<00:00:44.140> so<00:00:45.040> these<00:00:45.760> are<00:00:45.910> ones<00:00:46.060> out<00:00:46.210> of<00:00:46.240> the

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:46.330 
may do it so these are ones out of the

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.430 
may do it so these are ones out of the
packet<00:00:46.750> what<00:00:47.590> you've<00:00:47.710> got<00:00:47.890> is<00:00:48.130> the<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:50.140> actual

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
packet what you've got is the the actual

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.060 
packet what you've got is the the actual
mold<00:00:50.680> itself<00:00:51.070> which<00:00:51.880> is<00:00:52.030> silicon<00:00:52.420> based<00:00:53.070> it's

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
mold itself which is silicon based it's

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.979 
mold itself which is silicon based it's
quite<00:00:54.250> robust<00:00:54.579> so<00:00:55.240> the<00:00:55.329> kids<00:00:55.510> can<00:00:55.690> use<00:00:55.810> it

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
quite robust so the kids can use it

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:57.150 
quite robust so the kids can use it
they're<00:00:56.290> probably<00:00:56.440> not<00:00:56.620> gonna<00:00:56.739> break<00:00:56.950> that

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
they're probably not gonna break that

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.190 
they're probably not gonna break that
and<00:00:57.430> the<00:00:58.329> other<00:00:58.480> thing<00:00:58.570> that<00:00:58.690> you<00:00:58.870> get<00:00:59.020> as<00:00:59.170> well

00:00:59.190 --> 00:00:59.200 
and the other thing that you get as well

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.950 
and the other thing that you get as well
in<00:00:59.500> the<00:00:59.590> kit<00:00:59.770> is<00:01:00.520> the<00:01:00.970> actual<00:01:01.300> stainless<00:01:01.750> steel

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 
in the kit is the actual stainless steel

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.799 
in the kit is the actual stainless steel
cutter<00:01:03.149> again<00:01:04.149> that<00:01:04.329> will<00:01:04.420> give<00:01:04.570> you<00:01:04.659> the

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
cutter again that will give you the

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.340 
cutter again that will give you the
shape<00:01:05.049> of<00:01:05.350> the<00:01:05.979> petunia<00:01:06.869> so<00:01:07.869> you<00:01:07.960> can<00:01:08.110> put<00:01:08.259> it

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
shape of the petunia so you can put it

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.800 
shape of the petunia so you can put it
into<00:01:08.470> the<00:01:08.560> mold<00:01:08.830> so<00:01:09.159> we'll<00:01:09.280> get<00:01:09.400> started<00:01:09.810> so

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
into the mold so we'll get started so

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.330 
into the mold so we'll get started so
what<00:01:10.930> I've<00:01:11.020> done<00:01:11.110> first<00:01:11.380> is<00:01:11.620> uh<00:01:11.770> put<00:01:12.310> some

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
what I've done first is uh put some

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.030 
what I've done first is uh put some
petal<00:01:12.940> base<00:01:13.120> just<00:01:13.659> on<00:01:13.810> the<00:01:13.870> worktop<00:01:14.200> and<00:01:14.950> I've

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
petal base just on the worktop and I've

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.130 
petal base just on the worktop and I've
also<00:01:15.220> put<00:01:15.490> the<00:01:15.790> paddle<00:01:16.210> base<00:01:16.360> on<00:01:16.600> the<00:01:16.960> mold

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
also put the paddle base on the mold

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.460 
also put the paddle base on the mold
itself<00:01:17.560> just<00:01:18.400> to<00:01:18.550> act<00:01:18.700> as<00:01:18.850> a<00:01:18.880> release<00:01:19.240> agent<00:01:19.479> so

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
itself just to act as a release agent so

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.710 
itself just to act as a release agent so
we're<00:01:21.159> not<00:01:21.250> going<00:01:21.520> to<00:01:21.640> get<00:01:21.970> it<00:01:22.090> stuck<00:01:22.360> on<00:01:22.540> that

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
we're not going to get it stuck on that

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.110 
we're not going to get it stuck on that
so<00:01:23.710> we'll<00:01:23.830> start<00:01:24.100> off<00:01:24.220> so<00:01:24.700> I'm<00:01:24.790> going<00:01:24.970> to<00:01:25.030> use

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:25.120 
so we'll start off so I'm going to use

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.880 
so we'll start off so I'm going to use
marzipan<00:01:26.610> instead<00:01:27.610> of<00:01:28.110> any<00:01:29.110> icing<00:01:29.530> cuz<00:01:29.799> I

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
marzipan instead of any icing cuz I

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.130 
marzipan instead of any icing cuz I
prefer<00:01:30.159> marzipan<00:01:30.580> so<00:01:31.060> pull<00:01:31.240> out<00:01:31.270> the<00:01:31.570> worktop

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
prefer marzipan so pull out the worktop

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.940 
prefer marzipan so pull out the worktop
roll<00:01:33.130> it<00:01:33.280> out<00:01:33.369> not<00:01:33.909> too<00:01:34.119> thin<00:01:34.530> because<00:01:35.530> we<00:01:35.830> are

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
roll it out not too thin because we are

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.840 
roll it out not too thin because we are
going<00:01:36.100> to<00:01:36.190> compress<00:01:36.520> it<00:01:37.320> into<00:01:38.320> the<00:01:38.590> mold<00:01:39.159> so

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
going to compress it into the mold so

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.590 
going to compress it into the mold so
get<00:01:40.210> the<00:01:40.330> stainless<00:01:40.720> steel<00:01:40.930> cutter<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:42.600> as

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
get the stainless steel cutter and as

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.760 
get the stainless steel cutter and as
normal<00:01:44.049> like<00:01:44.799> any<00:01:44.950> cookie<00:01:45.369> over<00:01:45.490> cuddly<00:01:46.450> used

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.020 

gives<00:01:50.770> you<00:01:50.890> a<00:01:50.920> nice<00:01:51.460> shape<00:01:51.490> of<00:01:52.000> the<00:01:52.090> Chi<00:01:54.030> so

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
gives you a nice shape of the Chi so

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.719 
gives you a nice shape of the Chi so
again<00:01:55.390> there's<00:01:55.600> there's<00:01:56.049> some<00:01:56.380> petal<00:01:56.890> base<00:01:57.070> on

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
again there's there's some petal base on

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.060 
again there's there's some petal base on
the<00:01:58.060> work<00:01:58.240> topper<00:01:58.630> already<00:01:58.810> so<00:01:59.200> I'll<00:01:59.350> make<00:02:00.010> it

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
the work topper already so I'll make it

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.760 
the work topper already so I'll make it
slightly<00:02:00.850> tacky<00:02:01.299> just<00:02:01.990> so<00:02:02.229> we<00:02:02.380> can<00:02:02.560> put<00:02:02.740> some

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
slightly tacky just so we can put some

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.980 
slightly tacky just so we can put some
shimmer<00:02:03.189> on<00:02:03.340> it<00:02:03.460> later<00:02:03.670> so<00:02:04.030> we'll<00:02:04.659> take<00:02:04.810> them

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
shimmer on it later so we'll take them

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.060 
shimmer on it later so we'll take them
oh<00:02:05.110> there<00:02:05.619> it<00:02:05.710> is

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
oh there it is

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.960 
oh there it is
and<00:02:06.820> what<00:02:06.970> you<00:02:07.060> do<00:02:07.240> is<00:02:07.630> put<00:02:08.110> your<00:02:08.489> shape<00:02:09.489> into

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
and what you do is put your shape into

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.920 
and what you do is put your shape into
the<00:02:10.060> mold<00:02:10.299> just<00:02:10.799> line<00:02:11.799> up<00:02:12.629> now<00:02:13.629> it<00:02:13.749> doesn't

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
the mold just line up now it doesn't

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.280 
the mold just line up now it doesn't
matter<00:02:14.139> if<00:02:14.409> it

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
matter if it

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.559 
matter if it
the<00:02:15.560> edges<00:02:15.829> right<00:02:16.099> but<00:02:16.340> because<00:02:17.000> it'll

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
the edges right but because it'll

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.720 
the edges right but because it'll
centralize<00:02:18.110> when<00:02:18.319> you<00:02:18.409> put<00:02:18.560> them<00:02:18.680> all<00:02:18.799> on<00:02:18.860> so

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
centralize when you put them all on so

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:20.800 
centralize when you put them all on so
we're<00:02:19.849> going<00:02:19.969> to<00:02:20.060> do<00:02:20.120> is<00:02:20.239> just<00:02:20.359> fold<00:02:20.629> that

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
we're going to do is just fold that

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.149 
we're going to do is just fold that
across<00:02:21.969> into<00:02:22.969> the<00:02:23.060> middle<00:02:23.560> and<00:02:24.560> just<00:02:24.590> put<00:02:25.129> a

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:25.159 
across into the middle and just put a

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:28.599 
across into the middle and just put a
slight<00:02:25.760> bit<00:02:25.939> of<00:02:25.969> pressure<00:02:26.239> on<00:02:27.519> until<00:02:28.519> you

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:28.609 
slight bit of pressure on until you

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:30.280 
slight bit of pressure on until you
start<00:02:28.909> sitting<00:02:29.120> slightly<00:02:29.659> coming<00:02:30.079> out<00:02:30.170> of<00:02:30.230> the

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
start sitting slightly coming out of the

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.349 
start sitting slightly coming out of the
edge<00:02:30.349> and<00:02:31.189> then<00:02:31.400> just<00:02:31.579> take<00:02:31.760> that<00:02:31.790> pressure<00:02:32.209> on

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:32.359 
edge and then just take that pressure on

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:35.460 
edge and then just take that pressure on
your<00:02:32.629> CH<00:02:32.989> transfer<00:02:33.470> it<00:02:33.590> on<00:02:33.680> to<00:02:33.829> the<00:02:33.920> other<00:02:34.040> side

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
your CH transfer it on to the other side

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.429 
your CH transfer it on to the other side
it's<00:02:36.470> got<00:02:36.650> a<00:02:36.709> nice<00:02:36.890> imprint<00:02:37.790> there<00:02:38.200> so<00:02:39.200> we<00:02:39.290> can

00:02:39.429 --> 00:02:39.439 
it's got a nice imprint there so we can

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:45.099 
it's got a nice imprint there so we can
just<00:02:39.590> drop<00:02:39.769> that<00:02:39.829> out<00:02:40.099> of<00:02:40.220> the<00:02:40.280> mold<00:02:43.989> so<00:02:44.989> there

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:45.109 
just drop that out of the mold so there

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:47.110 
just drop that out of the mold so there
we<00:02:45.230> go<00:02:45.260> there's<00:02:45.560> the<00:02:45.620> petunia<00:02:46.159> and<00:02:46.340> then<00:02:46.969> what

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
we go there's the petunia and then what

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.330 
we go there's the petunia and then what
we<00:02:47.209> could<00:02:47.329> do<00:02:47.510> for<00:02:47.750> that<00:02:47.959> is<00:02:48.170> we<00:02:48.859> can<00:02:49.159> use<00:02:49.189> a

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
we could do for that is we can use a
