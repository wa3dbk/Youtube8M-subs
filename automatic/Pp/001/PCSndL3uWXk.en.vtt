00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:08.280
 hello guys welcome to my kitchen today 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.160
 We are sticking with the theme pizzas pizza 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.920
 today is the onion following with the 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.870
 theme pizzas we previously did the 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.000
 normal mozzarella pizza where they 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.250
 I teach to make the dough after we did 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.860
 with the premise of the mass that we had 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.710
 learned to do 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:28.520
 pizza of the policy that is the tomato 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:31.300
 agito and basil and now let's do 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:34.520
 the onion very fast and delicious 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:38.480
 ingredients the onion pizza pre 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:41.530
 oregano salt garlic powder grating cheese 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.239
 and mozzarella 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.670
 The first thing we are going to do is cut 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.649
 the onion is as young as 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.410
 can I here in this case I have more or 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:53.289
 minus 450 grams of onion 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.910
 so I have the onion cut 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:57.850
 couple and what I'm going to do is 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:00.449
 add a little oregano is more or 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.640
 minus a spoonful of oregano 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:07.110
 but it is also to taste to always know 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.110
 that is to taste a little salt 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:15.490
 in this case I put a little garlic in 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:17.800
 dust not very very little so what 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.660
 we are going to do is stir it so that it 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:25.330
 mix and we're going to take it to the pizza 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:27.610
 I have my pre pizza I am adding a 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.610
 little mozzarella down and now you 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.680
 I'm going to add onion the subject of 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.200
 oregano I want to tell us 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.180
 like with oregano and gives a super touch 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.730
 special and delicious can not be 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.220
 lose but as always I tell them if not 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:44.050
 they like oregano nothing happens not 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.720
 they put the onion is like a 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:49.750
 little bit sweeter but it's also 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.090
 very good this one not much face 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.090
 in this pizza you do not need to approach 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:58.120
 both the pre pizza as I told them before 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.470
 because it also remains rich that as the 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.479
 Onion is going to start with a little 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.510
 the cheese is very rich 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:08.070
 it is spectacular above the onion 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.070
 we are going to add the mozzarella 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.090
 and we add the mozzarella enough 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.370
 do not forget that the mozzarella is going to 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.480
 go putting between the onion then yes 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.909
 we add a little 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.129
 it's not going to be noticed then you have to 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:27.780
 put it enough that the mozzarella is the 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:30.690
 important part also apart from the 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.269
 onion of the pizza and on top of these 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.909
 super important details that gives you a 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:37.140
 excellent taste the cheese to gratify the 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:41.780
 grating cheese has to be a good 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.780
 Cheese is very tasty 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.620
 Super simple and ready is what 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.200

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:56.019

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.939
 degrees my maximum remember that for 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:00.459
 make a good pizza the oven has to 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:04.540
 being blue has to be very hot 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:06.400
