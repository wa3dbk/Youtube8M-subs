00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 Halli hello and welcome to the 17 series 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.319
 of the naimo torres and yes so slowly though 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.960
 surely we almost approach it 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.080
 One has to say so clearly at the end 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.309
 the team looks like it is currently 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.680
 everything is arranged on gold course 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.880
 Of course, it is only possible now 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.310
 so the whole team on a golden 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.960
 bring status 99 to reach chemistry 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.900
 and to make a single game with it 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.640
 and then this series is over 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.529
 explained and then we 'll see what he does 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.300
 then in the area old with him 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.370
 keep going will always come 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.079
 then this when the time comes 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.750
 At the moment we are not so on 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.750
 every case one bought the pace theme 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.030
 par excellence rally team is coming from now 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.239
 our storm and yes I thought so 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:52.350
 wanted or pato but i just 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.730
 against worlds is likely to be much 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.559
 worse experiences made but 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.719
 if I could play against him thought 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.640
 This time I should be on it first 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.530
 So try it and let's see if 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.989
 what kind of pressure is really what he is 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.369
 always plays against not clear one has 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.680
 always the feeling that the players 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.960
 while sometimes I kicker with the 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.909
 ball apart 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.320
 yes you always have the feeling that the 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.040
 Most players who play against on 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.890
 if they make a good play 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.390
 play a hundred times better than they would 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.009
 rather a game which unfortunately has 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.570
 somehow that way too 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.460
 keep it up against kik example 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.500
 keep everything I'm going to get 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.560
 he is totally a club then 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.939
 shit and somehow does not hold anything 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.729
 and yao have definitely suffered so far 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.770
 clearly overpowered saudi is expected 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.400
 I did not think so over the top 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:41.340
 now like harry mostly plays that way 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.320
 one thinks so but more on each 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.360
 fall pretty fast monster 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.070
 shot and sits down blatantly 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.159
 through with his not so big 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.840
 Body size is already violent but well 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.970
 because you can not change now yes 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.430
 that he has become so over the top 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.990
 was last year already on everyone 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.950
 In the meantime she is three to one 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.560
 know already the second half 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.799
 trained opponent but had one 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.030
 private team with dede or still in the 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.950
 defense 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.660
 therefore a fairly rapid response team 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.790
 Of course, as always, nothing's more 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.650
 new look out now 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.209
 that shows how really over 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.830
 power of the elites is the little man 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.390
 wins the actual ones 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.720
 the big premier league defender 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:24.180
 the headball duel and that's it 4 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.250
 to 1 well then we prosit but we also times 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.010
 with a scanner so important to me 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.709
 that does not work out as finally 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.270
 most of them are from mainz in the league 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.340
 one so far because of it are not so anymore 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:39.690
 many horny goal or my last time 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:41.400
 because meter, why always 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.290
 especially determined three four five 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.390
 people past that always came at the end of a 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.790
 person or my statements of leyen on 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:51.690
 failed end and as such there are no 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.130
 Goals maybe yes last, why 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.280
 again different but I can between 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.690
 of course not promise that way 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.340
 I can not influence properly 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.069
 it still depends on the enemy 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.959
 From the moment I play 51 the first victory 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.670
 highly deserved and that's what we stand for 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.050
 at ten points in league one and have 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.510
 Definitely would have definitely 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.610
 ever the descent conditionally so that 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.290
 of course, also a prerequisite 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.239
 not only that for a full game with 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.650
 follow the golden one in the swim 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.269
 Of course we also have the league 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.810
 win one that he stands in the now 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:24.150
 case except question because that's easy 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.910
 to the sheer not to glory once 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:30.299
 the complete in the complete division 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.709
 Win 5 to 10 1 and then win 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:33.180
 I can only do that as a whole 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.890
 completed at lakes of therefore there are 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.209
 also about winning the whole thing 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.769
 Of course we are not right in the first one 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.720
 of course it should work 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:41.670
 be better that we do not go down and 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.170
 Accordingly , so far we are looking pretty good 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.799
 have five more games or so for two 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.079
 Points 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:47.489
 that should be feasible first chance in 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:50.220
 this case for alston who meets the 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:52.230
 post but then the keeper plays the 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.440
 ball directly into the feet that just 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:59.010
 called striker waging and already 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.239
 it is 1 to 0 for us and the matter 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.000
 it looks very very neat 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:04.920
 after participants here the 2 2 draws with 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.910
 his left-hand adhesive has real ones too 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.460
 good left foot constantly feed and 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.780
 these 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:12.340
 Definitely merz and I stand it 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.170
 here it is already 220 then it is again 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.880
 possible off to a very good start 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.550
 and vocals second game i have now 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.960
 fourth or fifth gate already that 

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:22.120
 can be in any case as a top 

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:24.220
 Purchase our team rate the first 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.380
 Chance of the opponent after 45 minutes through 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.030
 clear alexander esswein he's in the front 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.730
 had marco reus is also a pretty 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.800
 over peter storm but well it belongs 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.790
 now it's easy for him now 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.770
 she is again with one 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.360
 wonderful skippers when he finishes the 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.650
 it is also a wonderful place tor 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.660
 whose one sandro still with the 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.190
 conclusion deeper can parry and 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.620
 directly in return then the runs 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.930
 attack over wine over reus over reus 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.580
 over esswein and esswein is now has 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.950
 now too much space mariano creates 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.060
 not really bothering it anymore 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.800
 if that was good the flu was in 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.300
 but that's why it's when we do 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.280
 against the sensational solved the idea 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.420
 the devices dodged is I think 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.870
 me she was really strong 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.820
 made 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.980
 it's right on the other side 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:06.100
 but worlds together with henry cotton 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:07.390
 valley toilets a henrike on now 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.270
 palettes of the world are not right 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:12.520
 attacked only in their post and already 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.710
 the 4 to 1 that was the cheese eaten 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.870
 four to one of such opponents not 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:19.390
 more came back with an entrance 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.400
 the first time is the second time here 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:24.070
 and now the keeper caution 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.780
 try him and he's just going along with you 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:27.730
 the feet of the thing was obsolete 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:30.520
 a little bit frustrates one against 88 0 

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:33.280
 watched the empty gate in front of him 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:35.860
 and yes it does not create the empty the 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.620
 estore in the empty gate to accommodate the 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.540
 ball in the empty gate so now s and yes 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.880
 much to 1 winner of the second game 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:46.450
 means 15 14 1 won I guess 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:48.010
 a very successful episode and so on 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:49.900
 we have already arrived with it 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:50.860
 Clear if you liked it I would 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.990
 me of course, thumbs up 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:55.450
 happy and otherwise I would say 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:57.160
 if today we like the 100 like sooo nice 

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:59.440
 as soon as it goes out then I invite 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:03.340
 what do we have on sunday one 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:04.900
 double up from glory and become 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:06.940
 Hopefully we'll see you at the next video 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:09.220
 back here again equal to the stats from 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:12.130
 Mr. x 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:14.220
 and yes, I would say until the next 

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:14.220
 times
