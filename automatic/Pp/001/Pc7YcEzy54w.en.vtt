and<00:00:25.039> the<00:00:26.039> propeller<00:00:26.430> on<00:00:26.670> this<00:00:26.820> first<00:00:27.090> test<00:00:27.330> is

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
and the propeller on this first test is

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.790 
and the propeller on this first test is
am<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:27.900> sleek<00:00:28.199> 19<00:00:28.740> by<00:00:28.920> eight<00:00:29.070> carbon<00:00:29.519> propeller

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
am a sleek 19 by eight carbon propeller

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.139 
am a sleek 19 by eight carbon propeller
so<00:00:31.800> first<00:00:32.040> I'll<00:00:32.219> run<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.489> motor<00:00:32.640> up<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.000> down

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
so first I'll run the motor up and down

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.850 
so first I'll run the motor up and down
briefly<00:00:33.420> just<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.170> make<00:00:34.350> sure<00:00:34.380> everything's

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
briefly just to make sure everything's

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.130 
briefly just to make sure everything's
working<00:00:34.950> correctly<00:00:35.550> then<00:00:36.480> we'll<00:00:36.660> switch<00:00:36.750> over

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
working correctly then we'll switch over

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.010 
working correctly then we'll switch over
