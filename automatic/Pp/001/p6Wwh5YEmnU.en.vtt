00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.650
 pig 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:36.549
 let's also use three pieces of 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:39.190
 cooked pork meat and now we're going to 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:43.000
 start with the preparation let's fry 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:48.130
 the ingredients are going to be put 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.780
 little by little with soft fire all the 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.540
 ingredients the Chileans are going to 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.610
 clean we will reveal to us 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.130
 all are well cleaned first 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.649
 we unveiled and since they are clean and 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.289
 We are going to fry while we are 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:04.630
 can we go sending this being 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:08.470
 the other ingredients the banana 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:10.450
 cookies the pineapple we are letting it fry 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.180
 on a gentle fire while we are 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.580
 preparing the cleaning the chiles 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.430
 almonds we are going to peel them and 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:23.560
 then we're going to toast the same with everyone 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:26.230
 the other ingredients to help us 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.319
 fry the chiles let's use two 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.569
 pallets so that the chili does not shrink and 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:34.239
 so that it is good everywhere 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.120
 then we will grind is we're going to grind 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:37.459
 in the liquefied 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.010
 because well, the other one is a little 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.830
 more complicated but it can be done if 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.200
 they want but it is not necessary we can be 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.000
 of the blender once we grind it 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.010
 let's go separating what we're going to 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.319
 moving by portions because we can not 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.870
 throw everything and we 're going to go 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:56.269
 helping with broth then we can use 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.150
 a pot like that and we can use the 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:01.129
 coal is delicious but good to 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.810
 lack of that we are going to do in a 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:05.599
 stainless steel pot and we 're going to 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.450
 have a stove we are going to take the grease 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:11.450
 that has the pig broth only the 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:14.420
 grease from above and we're going to put it in 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.020
 the pot and let's put the pieces there 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.810
 of meat 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.490
 the goal is that the meat is watching 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.920
 they inhabit it 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.660
 we are free to return little by little 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.410
 and we're going to let it be 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:32.220
 crunchy and the meat will go loosing its 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:34.470
 flavor and the objective is that which remains 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.490
 the taste has already impregnated the fat 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.780
 then we will incorporate the 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:42.390
 ingredients little by little and we're going to 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.580
 add the vinegar we are always going to 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.940
 to be moving and we are always going to 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:49.980
 keep on fire shortly and we continue 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.620
 adding the ingredients we follow 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.290
 moving it is important that they maintain 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.270
 all this moving and go 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.920
 incorporating the little ingredients to 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:04.920
 little at the time of seasoning we are going to 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:08.040
 add what would be the salt and what we 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:10.500
 was left of the broths we are going to take the 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:14.640
 chocolate let's throw the cubes of 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:17.580
 consume and we will add a little 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.890
 of salt if necessary but all the 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.799
 time we will move moving 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:24.139
 moving constantly 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:26.690
 important to keep moving around 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:30.379
 moment because he starts doing certain 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:32.870
 bubbles of heat as if it started to 

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:34.729
 boil but as it is thick you can 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.610
 burn then you must have a lot 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:39.650
 care that is not why splattering 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:44.620
 it is important to move it and to fire 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:47.569
 I told them that all the time 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.789
 Season lasts two hours 

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:53.300
 very well then once the mole is 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:57.259
 ready to savor we can use it to 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:05:00.229
 bathe the chicken pieces covered with 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:02.209
 the mold accompanied by rice beans 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:06.449
 We can make enchiladas or different 

00:05:02.209 --> 00:05:09.090
 dishes, well, this is 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:12.389
