time
oh<00:00:38.329> well<00:00:39.329> they<00:00:39.420> just<00:00:39.629> lay<00:00:39.840> you<00:00:40.800> know<00:00:40.920> one<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.399> day

and they might lay for a week for a week
is<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.440> average<00:00:47.870> it<00:00:48.870> depends<00:00:49.170> on<00:00:49.230> time<00:00:49.500> of

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
is the average it depends on time of

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.799 
is the average it depends on time of
year<00:00:50.010> if<00:00:50.370> it's<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.789> early<00:00:51.329> spring<00:00:51.690> and

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
year if it's the early spring and

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.750 
year if it's the early spring and
they're<00:00:51.960> real<00:00:52.140> healthy<00:00:52.530> they<00:00:52.680> might<00:00:52.890> lay<00:00:53.129> six

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
they're real healthy they might lay six

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.000 
they're real healthy they might lay six
a<00:00:53.879> week<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.300> then<00:00:54.870> by<00:00:55.020> fall<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:55.500> might<00:00:55.680> go<00:00:55.829> down

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
a week and then by fall it might go down

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.830 
a week and then by fall it might go down
to<00:00:56.160> jewel<00:00:56.370> week<00:00:56.640> if<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.180> harvest<00:00:57.360> every<00:00:57.690> day

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
to jewel week if you harvest every day

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.200 
to jewel week if you harvest every day

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.219 
nocturnal aerial cover why do they stay
here<00:01:17.030> because<00:01:18.030> these<00:01:18.479> birds<00:01:18.810> are<00:01:19.080> most

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
here because these birds are most

plunk here again you see the green grass
and<00:01:41.010> they're<00:01:41.490> just<00:01:41.700> moving<00:01:42.800> and<00:01:45.320> so<00:01:46.320> every

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
every three days they touch a quarter

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.630 
every three days they touch a quarter
anchor<00:01:49.080> which<00:01:49.260> means<00:01:49.530> this<00:01:49.710> six<00:01:50.010> acre<00:01:50.220> field

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
anchor which means this six acre field

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.400 
anchor which means this six acre field
has<00:01:51.480> a<00:01:51.510> 72<00:01:52.290> day<00:01:52.740> rotation<00:01:53.450> 72<00:01:54.450> days<00:01:54.630> they<00:01:55.020> they

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:55.410 
has a 72 day rotation 72 days they they

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.730 
has a 72 day rotation 72 days they they
cover<00:01:55.650> the<00:01:55.800> field<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.430> they'll<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.620> this<00:01:58.620> is

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
cover the field and they'll and this is

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.280 
cover the field and they'll and this is
not<00:01:58.860> nearly<00:01:59.130> as<00:01:59.250> intensive<00:02:00.090> as<00:02:00.120> the<00:02:00.690> broilers

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
not nearly as intensive as the broilers

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.560 
not nearly as intensive as the broilers
so<00:02:02.100> they'll<00:02:02.280> actually<00:02:02.550> come<00:02:02.970> back<00:02:03.210> on<00:02:03.450> the

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
so they'll actually come back on the

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.330 
so they'll actually come back on the
same<00:02:03.810> ground<00:02:04.140> here<00:02:04.380> three<00:02:04.620> times<00:02:04.890> in<00:02:05.070> a<00:02:05.130> season

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
same ground here three times in a season

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.389 
same ground here three times in a season
okay<00:02:06.110> but<00:02:07.110> they're<00:02:07.290> but<00:02:07.530> they're<00:02:07.680> not<00:02:07.830> is<00:02:08.040> not

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
okay but they're but they're not is not

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.449 
okay but they're but they're not is not
as<00:02:08.520> intensive<00:02:08.940> as<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.300> world<00:02:10.250> because<00:02:11.250> more

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
as intensive as the world because more

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.120 
as intensive as the world because more
space<00:02:11.700> more<00:02:12.150> way<00:02:12.600> more<00:02:12.840> space<00:02:13.080> yeah<00:02:13.440> a<00:02:13.650> lot<00:02:14.040> of

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
space more way more space yeah a lot of

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.250 
space more way more space yeah a lot of
people<00:02:14.430> live<00:02:14.610> in<00:02:14.900> residences<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:16.020> they<00:02:16.140> don't

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
people live in residences and they don't

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.070 
people live in residences and they don't
have<00:02:16.380> access<00:02:16.470> to<00:02:16.800> large<00:02:16.980> amounts<00:02:17.370> of<00:02:17.490> lon<00:02:18.080> so

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
have access to large amounts of lon so

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.280 
have access to large amounts of lon so
it<00:02:20.010> seems<00:02:20.280> like<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.730> raising<00:02:21.450> rabbits<00:02:21.720> would

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
it seems like the raising rabbits would

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.570 
it seems like the raising rabbits would
be<00:02:22.440> a<00:02:22.470> really<00:02:23.040> interesting<00:02:23.070> way<00:02:23.550> because

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
be a really interesting way because

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.690 
be a really interesting way because
they're<00:02:23.970> absolutely<00:02:25.040> sound<00:02:26.040> they<00:02:26.459> don't<00:02:26.490> make

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
they're absolutely sound they don't make

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.820 
they're absolutely sound they don't make
any<00:02:26.880> sounds<00:02:27.270> at<00:02:27.360> all<00:02:27.450> very<00:02:28.020> quiet<00:02:28.290> very<00:02:28.530> quiet

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
any sounds at all very quiet very quiet

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.910 
any sounds at all very quiet very quiet
and<00:02:29.160> they<00:02:29.820> require<00:02:30.209> 85<00:02:30.720> 85<00:02:31.530> percent<00:02:31.770> of<00:02:31.800> their

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
and they require 85 85 percent of their

simple this is you move it and just just
one<00:03:18.780> comment<00:03:19.019> on<00:03:19.200> the<00:03:19.290> structure<00:03:19.709> I<00:03:19.890> noticed

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
one comment on the structure I noticed

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.729 
one comment on the structure I noticed
unlike<00:03:20.880> the<00:03:21.030> chickens<00:03:21.390> which<00:03:21.510> had<00:03:21.690> 25%<00:03:22.200> open

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
unlike the chickens which had 25% open

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.470 
unlike the chickens which had 25% open
space<00:03:22.980> this<00:03:23.310> is<00:03:23.459> completely<00:03:23.820> enclosed<00:03:24.180> is

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
space this is completely enclosed is

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.530 
space this is completely enclosed is
that<00:03:24.630> because<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:24.930> rabbits<00:03:25.230> are<00:03:25.290> jump<00:03:25.500> out

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
that because the rabbits are jump out

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.339 
that because the rabbits are jump out
what's<00:03:27.540> because<00:03:27.900> it's<00:03:28.170> because<00:03:28.500> the<00:03:28.650> rabbits

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:29.349 
what's because it's because the rabbits

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:32.309 
what's because it's because the rabbits
so<00:03:30.099> they<00:03:30.219> like<00:03:30.459> it<00:03:30.640> more<00:03:30.790> shade<00:03:31.170> like<00:03:32.170> the

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
so they like it more shade like the

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:34.559 
so they like it more shade like the
light<00:03:32.530> chickens<00:03:33.249> really<00:03:33.609> like<00:03:33.790> light<00:03:34.090> okay

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 
light chickens really like light okay

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:36.750 
light chickens really like light okay
rabbits<00:03:34.989> don't<00:03:35.200> like<00:03:35.379> light<00:03:35.650> and<00:03:36.069> rabbits

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
rabbits don't like light and rabbits

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.550 
rabbits don't like light and rabbits
unlike<00:03:36.999> chickens<00:03:37.299> can<00:03:37.450> also<00:03:37.569> burrow<00:03:37.959> down<00:03:38.290> so

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
unlike chickens can also burrow down so

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.899 
unlike chickens can also burrow down so
that's<00:03:38.739> why<00:03:38.859> you<00:03:38.920> have<00:03:39.040> slats<00:03:39.459> underneath

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:41.909 
that's why you have slats underneath

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:44.670 
that's why you have slats underneath
that's<00:03:42.909> right<00:03:43.209> but<00:03:43.780> it<00:03:43.870> still<00:03:44.109> opposes

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
that's right but it still opposes

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.039 
that's right but it still opposes
seventy<00:03:45.370> percent<00:03:45.579> of<00:03:46.030> the<00:03:46.209> of<00:03:46.569> the<00:03:46.719> square

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
seventy percent of the of the square

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:50.280 
seventy percent of the of the square
inches<00:03:47.469> are<00:03:47.680> are<00:03:48.400> you<00:03:48.790> know<00:03:48.819> are<00:03:49.090> exposed<00:03:49.329> for

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
inches are are you know are exposed for

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.050 
inches are are you know are exposed for
the<00:03:50.889> rounds<00:03:51.250> when<00:03:51.430> you're<00:03:51.639> saying<00:03:51.879> they're

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
the rounds when you're saying they're

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.750 
the rounds when you're saying they're
effective<00:03:52.599> lawnmowers<00:03:53.049> that<00:03:53.230> one<00:03:53.500> acre<00:03:53.950> yeah

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
effective lawnmowers that one acre yeah

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.119 
effective lawnmowers that one acre yeah
so<00:03:54.969> one<00:03:55.150> yeah<00:03:55.510> I<00:03:55.810> mean<00:03:56.109> they're<00:03:56.500> they're<00:03:57.099> just

00:03:57.119 --> 00:03:57.129 
so one yeah I mean they're they're just

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:00.420 
so one yeah I mean they're they're just
placing<00:03:57.849> 85<00:03:58.389> or<00:03:59.049> 75<00:03:59.469> percent<00:03:59.499> at<00:03:59.950> least<00:04:00.159> of

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
placing 85 or 75 percent at least of

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.069 
placing 85 or 75 percent at least of
their<00:04:00.609> feed<00:04:00.969> through<00:04:01.329> the<00:04:01.450> grass<00:04:01.719> they're

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 
their feed through the grass they're

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:03.000 
their feed through the grass they're
converting<00:04:02.530> grass

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
converting grass

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.339 
converting grass
directly<00:04:03.370> into<00:04:03.700> me<00:04:03.879> so<00:04:04.689> if<00:04:04.810> you<00:04:04.840> take<00:04:05.169> the

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:05.349 
directly into me so if you take the

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:06.720 
directly into me so if you take the
value<00:04:05.500> of<00:04:05.709> the<00:04:05.829> meat<00:04:06.069> produced<00:04:06.459> from<00:04:06.639> the

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
value of the meat produced from the

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.449 
value of the meat produced from the
grass<00:04:06.969> one<00:04:07.449> acre<00:04:07.659> of<00:04:07.840> grass<00:04:08.189> put<00:04:09.189> through

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
grass one acre of grass put through

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:15.409 
grass one acre of grass put through
rabbits<00:04:10.799> adds<00:04:11.799> up<00:04:12.129> to<00:04:12.840> $45,000<00:04:13.840> in<00:04:13.870> value<00:04:14.409> Wow

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:15.419 
rabbits adds up to $45,000 in value Wow

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:18.349 
rabbits adds up to $45,000 in value Wow
now<00:04:16.419> obviously<00:04:16.959> it<00:04:17.109> takes<00:04:17.289> a<00:04:17.380> lot<00:04:17.560> more<00:04:17.590> time

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
now obviously it takes a lot more time
