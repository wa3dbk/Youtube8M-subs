will it release cortisol and make me

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.069 
will it release cortisol and make me
smaller<00:00:30.289> the<00:00:31.289> answer<00:00:31.650> is<00:00:31.830> no<00:00:32.719> you<00:00:33.719> have<00:00:33.899> to

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
remember cortisol is a hormone that is

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.970 
remember cortisol is a hormone that is
released<00:00:37.829> because<00:00:38.489> of<00:00:38.910> stress<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.540> anxiety

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
released because of stress and anxiety

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.450 
released because of stress and anxiety
not<00:00:40.980> because<00:00:41.399> of<00:00:41.430> adaptation<00:00:42.440> we<00:00:43.440> need<00:00:43.860> to

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
not because of adaptation we need to

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.779 
not because of adaptation we need to
train<00:00:45.000> our<00:00:45.239> bodies<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:45.840> force<00:00:46.500> our<00:00:46.739> bodies<00:00:47.190> to

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
train our bodies and force our bodies to

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.779 
train our bodies and force our bodies to
adapt<00:00:48.210> that's<00:00:49.079> where<00:00:49.440> working<00:00:49.800> out<00:00:50.129> comes<00:00:50.489> in

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
adapt that's where working out comes in

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.869 
adapt that's where working out comes in
you<00:00:51.539> work<00:00:51.840> out<00:00:52.050> your<00:00:52.590> body<00:00:52.890> overcomes<00:00:53.610> or

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
you work out your body overcomes or

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.760 
you work out your body overcomes or
adapts<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:54.660> stress<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:55.440> become

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
adapts to that stress and you become

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.520 
adapts to that stress and you become
bigger<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.129> stronger<00:00:56.539> without<00:00:57.539> that<00:00:57.899> stress

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
bigger and stronger without that stress

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.819 
bigger and stronger without that stress
of<00:00:58.920> working<00:00:59.879> out<00:01:00.359> you<00:01:01.170> wouldn't<00:01:01.500> become

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
of working out you wouldn't become

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.210 
of working out you wouldn't become
bigger<00:01:02.250> or<00:01:02.550> stronger<00:01:03.409> so<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.470> need<00:01:04.949> that

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
bigger or stronger so you need that

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
stress and believe it or not the harder

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.340 
stress and believe it or not the harder
