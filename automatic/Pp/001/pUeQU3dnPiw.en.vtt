00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
something to counteract that with he's

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.060 
something to counteract that with he's
character<00:00:59.320> who<00:00:59.379> has<00:00:59.469> a<00:00:59.500> lot<00:00:59.620> of<00:00:59.680> functionality

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
character who has a lot of functionality

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.920 
character who has a lot of functionality
at<00:01:00.309> all<00:01:00.460> different<00:01:00.640> ranges<00:01:01.059> so<00:01:01.239> the<00:01:01.449> amp<00:01:01.629> gives

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:01.930 
at all different ranges so the amp gives

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.139 
at all different ranges so the amp gives
him<00:01:02.079> a<00:01:02.140> lot<00:01:02.230> of<00:01:02.289> up<00:01:02.530> close<00:01:02.680> melee<00:01:03.190> but<00:01:03.879> his

00:01:04.139 --> 00:01:04.149 
him a lot of up close melee but his

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:06.749 
him a lot of up close melee but his
abilities<00:01:04.690> is<00:01:04.809> electricity<00:01:05.199> in<00:01:05.530> his<00:01:05.800> his<00:01:06.550> I

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:06.759 
abilities is electricity in his his I

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:08.310 
abilities is electricity in his his I
space<00:01:07.030> stuff<00:01:07.270> also<00:01:07.690> gives<00:01:07.930> him<00:01:08.049> a<00:01:08.080> lot<00:01:08.200> of

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
space stuff also gives him a lot of

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.710 
space stuff also gives him a lot of
medium<00:01:08.830> to<00:01:08.979> far<00:01:09.189> range<00:01:09.490> of<00:01:09.970> functionality<00:01:10.479> as

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
medium to far range of functionality as

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.300 
medium to far range of functionality as
well<00:01:10.750> so<00:01:11.020> he's<00:01:11.170> a<00:01:11.229> character<00:01:11.439> who's<00:01:11.950> equally

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
well so he's a character who's equally

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.800 
well so he's a character who's equally
at<00:01:12.460> home<00:01:12.490> I<00:01:12.700> think<00:01:13.030> at<00:01:13.150> the<00:01:13.240> very<00:01:13.270> very<00:01:13.479> close

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
at home I think at the very very close

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.060 
at home I think at the very very close
range<00:01:14.080> mixing<00:01:14.470> up<00:01:14.530> there<00:01:14.650> with<00:01:14.740> like<00:01:14.799> the<00:01:14.920> Kray

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
range mixing up there with like the Kray

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.190 
range mixing up there with like the Kray
doses<00:01:15.400> but<00:01:16.270> also<00:01:16.420> the<00:01:16.630> medium<00:01:16.869> in<00:01:16.960> the<00:01:16.990> Far

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
doses but also the medium in the Far

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.770 
doses but also the medium in the Far
range<00:01:17.439> but<00:01:17.860> with<00:01:18.010> like<00:01:18.100> erratic<00:01:18.580> or<00:01:18.760> or<00:01:19.420> Jack

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
range but with like erratic or or Jack

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.830 
range but with like erratic or or Jack
actually<00:01:20.259> yeah<00:01:20.770> so<00:01:21.130> Cole's<00:01:21.430> a<00:01:21.790> level<00:01:22.270> 3<00:01:22.450> super

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
actually yeah so Cole's a level 3 super

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.010 
actually yeah so Cole's a level 3 super
I<00:01:23.049> believe<00:01:23.590> it's<00:01:23.710> called<00:01:23.830> the<00:01:23.979> ionic<00:01:24.430> vortex

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
I believe it's called the ionic vortex

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.630 
I believe it's called the ionic vortex
that<00:01:26.020> was<00:01:26.140> one<00:01:26.290> of<00:01:26.320> the<00:01:26.409> I<00:01:26.770> think<00:01:26.860> the

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
that was one of the I think the

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.030 
that was one of the I think the
scene-stealing<00:01:27.909> moments<00:01:28.570> from<00:01:28.659> e3<00:01:28.979> 2010<00:01:29.979> i

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
scene-stealing moments from e3 2010 i

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.230 
scene-stealing moments from e3 2010 i
want<00:01:30.280> to<00:01:30.340> say<00:01:30.460> when<00:01:30.610> they<00:01:30.729> unveiled<00:01:31.030> that

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
want to say when they unveiled that

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.960 
want to say when they unveiled that
ability<00:01:32.170> and<00:01:32.380> so<00:01:32.829> we<00:01:33.009> knew<00:01:33.130> that<00:01:33.400> that<00:01:33.549> that

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
ability and so we knew that that that

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.420 
ability and so we knew that that that
particular<00:01:34.119> moment<00:01:34.479> had<00:01:34.750> such<00:01:34.900> a<00:01:34.990> strong

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
particular moment had such a strong

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.920 
particular moment had such a strong
impact<00:01:36.430> on<00:01:36.790> a<00:01:36.850> lot<00:01:36.909> of<00:01:37.060> the<00:01:37.119> fans<00:01:37.360> that<00:01:37.659> we<00:01:37.750> want

eight<00:02:38.630> guns<00:02:39.049> just<00:02:39.739> in<00:02:39.860> his<00:02:40.010> normal<00:02:40.519> move<00:02:40.730> set

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
eight guns just in his normal move set

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.640 
eight guns just in his normal move set
and<00:02:41.209> they<00:02:41.569> all<00:02:41.720> are<00:02:41.989> good<00:02:42.170> at<00:02:42.260> dealing<00:02:42.410> with

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
and they all are good at dealing with

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.559 
and they all are good at dealing with
different<00:02:42.860> ranges<00:02:43.310> in<00:02:43.790> different<00:02:44.180> distances

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
different ranges in different distances

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:45.610 
different ranges in different distances
and<00:02:44.660> he<00:02:44.750> can<00:02:44.870> also<00:02:44.930> use<00:02:45.200> them<00:02:45.319> in<00:02:45.410> the<00:02:45.500> air

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
and he can also use them in the air

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.250 
and he can also use them in the air
which<00:02:45.890> is<00:02:46.040> a<00:02:46.069> very<00:02:46.549> unique<00:02:46.849> ability<00:02:47.269> that<00:02:48.140> he

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
which is a very unique ability that he

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.479 
which is a very unique ability that he
can<00:02:48.410> start<00:02:48.590> an<00:02:48.709> attack<00:02:48.890> in<00:02:49.010> the<00:02:49.099> air<00:02:49.220> and<00:02:49.370> have

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
can start an attack in the air and have

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.370 
can start an attack in the air and have
that<00:02:49.670> carry<00:02:49.910> it<00:02:50.060> carry<00:02:50.180> out<00:02:50.390> onto<00:02:51.140> the<00:02:51.230> ground

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
that carry it carry out onto the ground

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.420 
that carry it carry out onto the ground
as<00:02:51.560> well<00:02:51.680> so<00:02:52.280> if<00:02:52.640> he's<00:02:52.790> got<00:02:53.000> his<00:02:53.540> reflector

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
as well so if he's got his reflector

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
as well so if he's got his reflector
he's<00:02:55.430> got<00:02:55.579> his<00:02:55.670> traditional<00:02:55.970> blaster<00:02:56.360> and

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
he's got his traditional blaster and

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:57.880 
he's got his traditional blaster and
those<00:02:56.540> are<00:02:56.630> probably<00:02:56.810> the<00:02:56.930> attacks<00:02:57.680> that<00:02:57.769> he

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
those are probably the attacks that he

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.319 
those are probably the attacks that he
has<00:02:58.069> with<00:02:58.220> his<00:02:58.400> greatest<00:02:58.640> range<00:02:58.970> but<00:02:59.120> he<00:02:59.209> also

00:02:59.319 --> 00:02:59.329 
has with his greatest range but he also

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:01.030 
has with his greatest range but he also
has<00:02:59.510> the<00:02:59.630> mass<00:02:59.810> inverter<00:03:00.200> which<00:03:00.709> we<00:03:00.860> showed

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
has the mass inverter which we showed

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.470 
has the mass inverter which we showed
