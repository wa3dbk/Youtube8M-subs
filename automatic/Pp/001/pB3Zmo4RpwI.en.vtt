00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:17.429
 this one the cra 

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:19.839
 when we do not form 

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:22.640
 we started singing with franco era 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.390
 one of the issues 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.470
 more privileged percent we had 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.239
 within the concept of almansa was already 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:32.060
 if our music goes 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.890
 per cent jover aa to different school establishments 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.160
 and 5 and bigheaded kid what you've ever done before 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.840
 and I think the president does not force barbaric for folklore 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.900
 everyone is 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.900
 the soldiers 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 no one 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.629
 analysis for the billboard that 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:05.550
 the glory we make 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.580
 Dr. Marcelo Toledo is a meeting of 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.630
 the artist that you want 1 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.070
 one the other too 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.640
 sandino admiration and respect 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.730
 above all that is what unites us 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.020
 for one hundrerd 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.130
 I already said it was considerable 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.460
 singing songs of the popular songbook 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.490
 it is not before the crowd 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.170
 rescuing authors 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.150
 p 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.060
 like brothers 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.060
 the brothers now normal to Simon 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.340
 faced to work or not 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.720
 non-essential professionals 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.670
 what's wrong with it 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.180
 in santiago del estero 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.439
 ii for making versions in our own way 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.470
 injuries 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.470
 efe out there with guitar and bass drum 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.560
 the musicians of the band 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.520
 loyal menchaca is already 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.520
 really formed somewhere 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.460
 by the hand of franco and another unit 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.179
 well this between mere and tagra gabriel banegas 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.439
 for one hundrerd 

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:11.909
 oscar gorosito 

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:14.669
 by the way they have promised a trade was 

00:02:14.669 --> 00:02:17.099
 and then we have this 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.679
 in second b bala a paco 

00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:22.119
 percent since the life of franco that is 

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:23.159
 and so this one 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:26.629
 that the band gaites really accompany me chacarera 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:29.509
 doing and tarija 

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:33.569
 and I frank also so this one the truth that is a group that this one 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:38.559
 little by little it is going is forming is going assembling and the idea is that we have 

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:41.819
 had of the first beginning with franco 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.959
 that is something sachero something clean not to put the low volume that the avatar 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.359
 try to make it something different 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:54.209
 according to the themes that we play do not mount be frank be the topics are 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:55.359
 traditional 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:56.789
 of authors 

00:02:56.789 --> 00:03:01.819
 very traditional of santiago is why we want to have this part well 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:04.609
 criollo del del show 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:07.609

 good each one you follow with their performances each 

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:30.299
 is doing its job but without leaving aside this project that has begun 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:31.709
 last year and that 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.159
 indicator taking more strength do not take more strength was being liked by the 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:39.159
 people and that's what interests me 

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:44.069
 amnesty
