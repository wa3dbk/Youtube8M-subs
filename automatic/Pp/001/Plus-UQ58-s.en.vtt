00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
the weapon is 170 and I'm I build the

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.290 
the weapon is 170 and I'm I build the
attack<00:01:07.140> rating<00:01:07.410> is<00:01:07.649> 305<00:01:08.520> with<00:01:08.940> a<00:01:08.970> ring<00:01:09.210> of

attack rating is 305 with a ring of
blades<00:01:09.570> plus<00:01:09.869> 2<00:01:10.140> so<00:01:10.860> 255<00:01:11.700> without<00:01:12.060> one<00:01:12.270> now

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
blades plus 2 so 255 without one now

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.930 
blades plus 2 so 255 without one now
that's<00:01:13.170> not<00:01:13.380> terrible<00:01:13.830> because<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.700> fact

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:14.940 
that's not terrible because of the fact

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.219 
that's not terrible because of the fact
that<00:01:15.030> it<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.450> twin<00:01:15.750> blade<00:01:15.959> and<00:01:16.080> has<00:01:16.200> a

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
that it is a twin blade and has a

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.710 
that it is a twin blade and has a
standard<00:01:16.649> twin<00:01:17.069> blade<00:01:17.250> moveset<00:01:17.700> there<00:01:18.479> are

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
standard twin blade moveset there are

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.770 
standard twin blade moveset there are
multiple<00:01:19.200> hits<00:01:19.470> per<00:01:19.770> attack<00:01:20.490> so<00:01:20.880> it<00:01:21.360> builds<00:01:21.720> up

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
multiple hits per attack so it builds up

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.150 
multiple hits per attack so it builds up
relatively<00:01:22.380> well<00:01:23.300> the<00:01:24.300> bleeding<00:01:25.080> base<00:01:25.740> damage

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
relatively well the bleeding base damage

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.850 
relatively well the bleeding base damage
because<00:01:26.550> this<00:01:26.819> does<00:01:27.179> have<00:01:27.209> a<00:01:27.780> bleeding<00:01:28.500> effect

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
because this does have a bleeding effect

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.029 
because this does have a bleeding effect
to<00:01:29.069> it<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.819> bleed<00:01:30.060> base<00:01:30.239> is<00:01:30.479> 40<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.770> bleed

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:32.039 
to it the bleed base is 40 the bleed

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:36.320 
to it the bleed base is 40 the bleed
total<00:01:32.489> for<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:32.970> build<00:01:33.119> is<00:01:34.399> 108<00:01:35.399> and<00:01:35.640> I<00:01:36.090> did

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
total for the build is 108 and I did

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.479 
total for the build is 108 and I did
wear<00:01:36.599> the<00:01:36.929> crest<00:01:37.259> of<00:01:37.410> blood<00:01:37.619> which<00:01:37.860> increases

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:38.489 
wear the crest of blood which increases

00:01:38.489 --> 00:01:41.510 
wear the crest of blood which increases
your<00:01:38.520> bleed<00:01:39.030> by<00:01:39.750> an<00:01:39.989> extra<00:01:40.349> 50<00:01:40.770> so<00:01:41.310> that

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
your bleed by an extra 50 so that

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.510 
your bleed by an extra 50 so that
brought<00:01:41.759> my<00:01:41.910> bleed<00:01:42.270> total<00:01:42.690> to<00:01:42.899> 158<00:01:43.830> for<00:01:44.340> this

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
brought my bleed total to 158 for this

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.990 
brought my bleed total to 158 for this
video<00:01:45.140> that<00:01:46.140> being<00:01:46.410> said<00:01:46.649> I<00:01:46.920> did<00:01:47.489> not<00:01:47.520> wear<00:01:47.819> any

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
video that being said I did not wear any

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.760 
video that being said I did not wear any
of<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.239> other<00:01:48.420> bleed<00:01:48.840> increasing<00:01:49.349> here<00:01:49.590> like

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
of the other bleed increasing here like

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.169 
of the other bleed increasing here like
the<00:01:49.950> shadow<00:01:50.250> gauntlets<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:50.849> don't<00:01:51.090> even

00:01:51.169 --> 00:01:51.179 
the shadow gauntlets I don't even

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:53.300 
the shadow gauntlets I don't even
actually<00:01:51.569> have<00:01:51.599> a<00:01:51.690> pair<00:01:51.929> of<00:01:51.959> them<00:01:52.170> so<00:01:52.979> I<00:01:53.039> don't

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
actually have a pair of them so I don't

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.070 
actually have a pair of them so I don't
know<00:01:53.429> how<00:01:53.580> well<00:01:53.940> that<00:01:53.970> would<00:01:54.390> increase<00:01:54.840> the

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
know how well that would increase the

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.960 
know how well that would increase the
bleed<00:01:55.319> -<00:01:55.800> you<00:01:56.129> know<00:01:56.220> make<00:01:56.459> it<00:01:56.489> more<00:01:56.610> viable

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
bleed - you know make it more viable

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.240 
bleed - you know make it more viable
because<00:01:57.720> in<00:01:58.080> this<00:01:58.200> entire<00:01:58.470> video<00:01:58.679> I<00:01:58.890> do<00:01:59.039> not

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
because in this entire video I do not

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.100 
because in this entire video I do not
believe<00:01:59.489> I<00:01:59.550> bled<00:01:59.940> out<00:01:59.970> any<00:02:00.360> of<00:02:00.569> the<00:02:00.690> people<00:02:00.959> any

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
believe I bled out any of the people any

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.609 
believe I bled out any of the people any
of<00:02:01.229> my<00:02:01.349> friends<00:02:01.679> that<00:02:01.800> I<00:02:01.830> was<00:02:01.890> fighting<00:02:02.399> so<00:02:03.619> it

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
of my friends that I was fighting so it

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.859 
of my friends that I was fighting so it
is<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.890> way<00:02:04.979> it<00:02:05.099> is<00:02:05.160> very<00:02:05.629> difficult<00:02:06.629> to<00:02:06.780> get

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
is the way it is very difficult to get

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.070 
is the way it is very difficult to get
that<00:02:07.080> bleed<00:02:07.349> to<00:02:07.590> activate<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.280> you<00:02:08.759> know<00:02:09.080> when

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
that bleed to activate and you know when

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.660 
that bleed to activate and you know when
you<00:02:10.170> do<00:02:10.289> it's<00:02:10.440> not<00:02:10.679> exactly<00:02:11.039> worth<00:02:11.310> it<00:02:11.489> to<00:02:11.580> be

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
you do it's not exactly worth it to be

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.110 
you do it's not exactly worth it to be
perfectly<00:02:12.090> honest<00:02:12.480> but<00:02:13.470> that's<00:02:13.790> that's<00:02:14.790> more

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
perfectly honest but that's that's more

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.589 
perfectly honest but that's that's more
for<00:02:15.599> a<00:02:15.870> later<00:02:16.260> time<00:02:16.680> in<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.099> video<00:02:17.220> more<00:02:17.670> to

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
for a later time in the video more to

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:21.770 
for a later time in the video more to
talk<00:02:18.750> about<00:02:18.810> later<00:02:19.370> now<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:21.329> counter

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
talk about later now the counter

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.360 
talk about later now the counter
strength<00:02:22.049> of<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.290> weapon<00:02:22.590> is<00:02:22.769> 100

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
strength of the weapon is 100

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.210 
strength of the weapon is 100
10<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:24.330> poise<00:02:24.629> damage<00:02:25.080> of<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.290> weapon<00:02:25.319> is<00:02:25.709> 25

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
10 the poise damage of the weapon is 25

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.710 
10 the poise damage of the weapon is 25
per<00:02:26.519> hit<00:02:26.730> and<00:02:26.909> the<00:02:27.180> weight<00:02:27.360> is<00:02:27.599> 10<00:02:27.989> units<00:02:28.700> so

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
per hit and the weight is 10 units so

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.920 
per hit and the weight is 10 units so
this<00:02:30.720> weapon<00:02:31.430> very<00:02:32.430> uncommon<00:02:32.849> I<00:02:33.209> honestly<00:02:33.690> can

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
this weapon very uncommon I honestly can

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.500 
this weapon very uncommon I honestly can
say<00:02:33.959> I've<00:02:34.230> never<00:02:34.440> had<00:02:35.220> anyone<00:02:35.580> use<00:02:35.849> it<00:02:36.030> against

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
say I've never had anyone use it against

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.869 
say I've never had anyone use it against
me<00:02:36.659> in<00:02:36.780> PvP<00:02:37.260> and<00:02:37.470> I'd<00:02:38.220> have<00:02:38.370> to<00:02:38.400> say<00:02:38.580> that's

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 
me in PvP and I'd have to say that's

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:40.910 
me in PvP and I'd have to say that's
probably<00:02:39.090> more<00:02:39.810> down<00:02:40.079> to<00:02:40.260> the<00:02:40.349> requirements

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
probably more down to the requirements

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.390 
probably more down to the requirements
than<00:02:41.069> to<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.310> fact<00:02:41.549> that<00:02:41.790> it<00:02:42.209> is<00:02:42.510> a<00:02:43.400> decently

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
than to the fact that it is a decently

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.690 
than to the fact that it is a decently
bad<00:02:44.760> weapon<00:02:45.349> it's<00:02:46.349> just<00:02:46.799> it's<00:02:47.040> not<00:02:47.190> great<00:02:47.519> to

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
bad weapon it's just it's not great to

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.390 
bad weapon it's just it's not great to
be<00:02:47.730> perfectly<00:02:48.390> honest<00:02:48.829> that<00:02:49.829> being<00:02:50.040> said<00:02:50.190> it's

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
be perfectly honest that being said it's

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.750 
be perfectly honest that being said it's
not<00:02:50.579> horrible<00:02:50.879> I've<00:02:51.299> used<00:02:51.599> worse<00:02:51.870> but<00:02:52.760> you

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
not horrible I've used worse but you

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.539 
not horrible I've used worse but you
know<00:02:54.140> it's<00:02:55.140> definitely<00:02:55.650> not<00:02:55.769> top<00:02:56.010> tier<00:02:56.310> and

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
know it's definitely not top tier and

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.130 
know it's definitely not top tier and
because<00:02:56.849> of<00:02:56.879> that<00:02:57.000> people<00:02:57.299> don't<00:02:57.780> really<00:02:58.019> use

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
because of that people don't really use

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.140 
because of that people don't really use
it<00:02:59.359> so<00:03:00.359> I'd<00:03:01.230> have<00:03:01.470> to<00:03:01.590> say<00:03:01.829> that<00:03:02.099> the<00:03:02.819> biggest

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
it so I'd have to say that the biggest

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.059 
it so I'd have to say that the biggest
con<00:03:03.329> of<00:03:03.480> this<00:03:03.599> weapon<00:03:03.750> would<00:03:04.170> probably<00:03:04.709> be<00:03:04.890> the

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
con of this weapon would probably be the

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.430 
con of this weapon would probably be the
fact<00:03:05.310> that<00:03:05.640> it<00:03:06.090> is<00:03:06.180> actually<00:03:06.660> the<00:03:06.840> shortest<00:03:07.319> of

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
fact that it is actually the shortest of

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.530 
fact that it is actually the shortest of
the<00:03:07.560> twin<00:03:07.769> blades<00:03:08.010> because<00:03:08.879> the<00:03:09.030> blades<00:03:09.239> do

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
the twin blades because the blades do

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.720 
the twin blades because the blades do
curved<00:03:09.870> away<00:03:10.019> you<00:03:10.590> know<00:03:10.709> it's<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:11.370> curved

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
curved away you know it's the curved

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.559 
curved away you know it's the curved
twin<00:03:12.150> blade<00:03:12.390> it<00:03:13.109> is<00:03:13.400> shorter<00:03:14.400> than<00:03:14.579> the<00:03:14.640> other

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
twin blade it is shorter than the other

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.539 
twin blade it is shorter than the other
twin<00:03:15.840> blades<00:03:16.049> and<00:03:16.349> it's<00:03:16.920> not<00:03:17.129> a<00:03:17.159> horrible

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
twin blades and it's not a horrible

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.270 
twin blades and it's not a horrible
thing<00:03:17.849> but<00:03:18.090> it<00:03:18.930> does<00:03:19.109> make<00:03:19.319> it<00:03:19.349> a<00:03:19.650> lot<00:03:20.010> more

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
thing but it does make it a lot more

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.220 
thing but it does make it a lot more
difficult<00:03:20.730> to<00:03:20.760> actually<00:03:21.390> make<00:03:21.569> contact<00:03:22.079> with

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
difficult to actually make contact with

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.800 
difficult to actually make contact with
the<00:03:22.379> person<00:03:22.799> because<00:03:23.430> they<00:03:23.579> can<00:03:23.760> just<00:03:23.810> walk

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
the person because they can just walk

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.259 
the person because they can just walk
away<00:03:25.049> at<00:03:25.290> a<00:03:25.379> leisurely<00:03:25.620> pace<00:03:26.099> and<00:03:26.430> not<00:03:26.819> have<00:03:27.150> to

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
away at a leisurely pace and not have to

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.479 
away at a leisurely pace and not have to
worry<00:03:27.450> about<00:03:27.599> it<00:03:27.840> pretty<00:03:27.989> much<00:03:28.370> compared<00:03:29.370> to

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
worry about it pretty much compared to

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.580 
worry about it pretty much compared to
the<00:03:29.579> other<00:03:29.700> twin<00:03:29.910> blades<00:03:30.180> where<00:03:30.480> you've<00:03:31.380> got<00:03:31.560> a

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
the other twin blades where you've got a

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.699 
the other twin blades where you've got a
little<00:03:31.980> bit<00:03:32.220> more<00:03:32.280> reach<00:03:32.700> so<00:03:33.660> with<00:03:34.410> this<00:03:34.500> one

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
little bit more reach so with this one

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:35.900 
little bit more reach so with this one
you<00:03:34.739> really<00:03:35.040> have<00:03:35.130> to<00:03:35.250> be<00:03:35.340> right<00:03:35.549> on<00:03:35.700> top<00:03:35.880> of

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
you really have to be right on top of

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.280 
you really have to be right on top of
your<00:03:36.150> opponent<00:03:36.599> in<00:03:36.690> order<00:03:36.750> for<00:03:37.049> it<00:03:37.139> to<00:03:37.169> be

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
your opponent in order for it to be

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.720 
your opponent in order for it to be
effective<00:03:37.380> and<00:03:37.889> because<00:03:38.160> of<00:03:38.190> that<00:03:38.310> I<00:03:38.430> find

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
effective and because of that I find

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.750 
effective and because of that I find
that<00:03:38.879> it's<00:03:39.150> actually<00:03:39.299> a<00:03:39.750> lot<00:03:40.620> easier<00:03:41.129> to<00:03:41.340> parry

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
that it's actually a lot easier to parry

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.580 
that it's actually a lot easier to parry
or<00:03:42.030> to<00:03:42.269> be<00:03:42.510> parried<00:03:42.900> when<00:03:43.019> you're<00:03:43.169> using<00:03:43.349> it

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
or to be parried when you're using it

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.039 
or to be parried when you're using it
because<00:03:43.709> your<00:03:44.190> opponent<00:03:44.370> knows<00:03:44.730> right<00:03:45.690> when

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
because your opponent knows right when

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:47.690 
because your opponent knows right when
you're<00:03:46.410> going<00:03:46.590> to<00:03:46.709> be<00:03:46.859> attacking<00:03:47.160> for<00:03:47.609> the

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
you're going to be attacking for the

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.490 
you're going to be attacking for the
most<00:03:47.849> part<00:03:48.150> because<00:03:48.419> you're<00:03:49.019> going<00:03:49.290> to<00:03:49.349> wait

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
most part because you're going to wait

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.890 
most part because you're going to wait
till<00:03:49.650> you're<00:03:49.799> right<00:03:50.069> on<00:03:50.190> top<00:03:50.400> of<00:03:50.549> them<00:03:50.669> and

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
till you're right on top of them and

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.199 
till you're right on top of them and
well<00:03:52.099> it<00:03:53.099> doesn't<00:03:53.370> really<00:03:53.489> end<00:03:53.790> well<00:03:53.970> for<00:03:54.000> you

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
well it doesn't really end well for you

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.860 
well it doesn't really end well for you
in<00:03:54.329> a<00:03:54.389> lot<00:03:54.510> of<00:03:54.540> cases<00:03:55.430> now<00:03:56.430> with<00:03:57.180> this<00:03:57.389> weapon<00:03:57.569> I

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
in a lot of cases now with this weapon I

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.470 
in a lot of cases now with this weapon I
did<00:03:58.109> look<00:03:58.290> into<00:03:58.530> the<00:03:58.650> bleedin<00:03:58.980> fusion<00:03:59.459> so<00:04:00.150> when

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
did look into the bleedin fusion so when

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.930 
did look into the bleedin fusion so when
you<00:04:00.569> do<00:04:00.780> infuse<00:04:01.319> it<00:04:01.440> with<00:04:01.530> bleed<00:04:01.859> the<00:04:02.370> physical

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
you do infuse it with bleed the physical

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.140

the attack rating goes down from 255 to

214 and with are no blades +2 it
actually<00:04:12.660> still<00:04:12.959> gives<00:04:13.169> you<00:04:13.319> 40<00:04:13.739> attack

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
actually still gives you 40 attack

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.270 
actually still gives you 40 attack
rating<00:04:14.669> extra<00:04:15.660> instead<00:04:16.530> of<00:04:16.650> instead<00:04:17.070> of<00:04:17.130> the

rating extra instead of instead of the

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.039 
rating extra instead of instead of the
full<00:04:17.430> 50<00:04:17.789> so<00:04:18.120> that's<00:04:18.419> something<00:04:18.780> a<00:04:18.870> lot<00:04:18.989> of

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
full 50 so that's something a lot of

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.229 
full 50 so that's something a lot of
case<00:04:19.289> in<00:04:19.650> a<00:04:19.709> lot<00:04:19.859> of<00:04:19.889> cases<00:04:20.130> it<00:04:20.459> drops<00:04:20.940> lower

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
case in a lot of cases it drops lower

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.629 
case in a lot of cases it drops lower
than<00:04:21.479> that<00:04:21.630> but<00:04:22.440> with<00:04:22.590> this<00:04:22.710> one<00:04:22.889> it<00:04:22.949> still

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:23.639 
than that but with this one it still

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:25.939 
than that but with this one it still
gives<00:04:23.760> you<00:04:23.940> 40<00:04:24.389> which<00:04:24.690> is<00:04:24.930> not<00:04:25.320> a<00:04:25.349> bad<00:04:25.560> thing<00:04:25.770> at

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:25.949 
gives you 40 which is not a bad thing at

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:30.260 
gives you 40 which is not a bad thing at
all<00:04:26.099> the<00:04:27.090> bleed<00:04:27.449> base<00:04:27.690> is<00:04:27.930> 57<00:04:28.830> and<00:04:29.060> for<00:04:30.060> the

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
all the bleed base is 57 and for the

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.469 
all the bleed base is 57 and for the
build<00:04:30.419> I'm<00:04:30.630> on<00:04:30.780> it's<00:04:31.020> 57<00:04:31.560> +<00:04:31.770> 123<00:04:32.520> in<00:04:33.150> addition

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:33.479 
build I'm on it's 57 + 123 in addition

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:35.390 
build I'm on it's 57 + 123 in addition
to<00:04:33.570> that<00:04:33.719> of<00:04:33.930> course<00:04:34.050> I<00:04:34.469> use<00:04:34.740> the<00:04:34.950> crest<00:04:35.280> of

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
to that of course I use the crest of

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.200 
to that of course I use the crest of
blood<00:04:35.640> so<00:04:36.419> that<00:04:36.450> brought<00:04:36.840> mine

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
blood so that brought mine

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.129 
blood so that brought mine
total<00:04:37.630> up<00:04:37.810> to<00:04:37.860> 230<00:04:39.509> that<00:04:40.509> being<00:04:40.720> said<00:04:40.960> I<00:04:41.020> did

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:41.139 
total up to 230 that being said I did

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:43.559 
total up to 230 that being said I did
not<00:04:41.410> use<00:04:41.650> that<00:04:41.800> in<00:04:42.009> the<00:04:42.130> video<00:04:42.340> I<00:04:42.639> have<00:04:43.330> yet<00:04:43.539> to

00:04:43.559 --> 00:04:43.569 
not use that in the video I have yet to

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:45.570 
not use that in the video I have yet to
use<00:04:43.750> it<00:04:43.930> still<00:04:44.229> to<00:04:44.440> be<00:04:44.500> perfectly<00:04:44.889> honest<00:04:45.250> but

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
use it still to be perfectly honest but

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.580 
use it still to be perfectly honest but
for<00:04:46.360> the<00:04:46.419> video<00:04:46.539> itself<00:04:46.960> I<00:04:47.229> felt<00:04:47.410> as<00:04:47.560> though

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
for the video itself I felt as though

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.080 
for the video itself I felt as though
having<00:04:48.039> a<00:04:48.099> higher<00:04:48.280> attack<00:04:48.639> rating<00:04:48.970> would<00:04:49.030> be

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
having a higher attack rating would be

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:50.610 
having a higher attack rating would be
more<00:04:49.389> beneficial<00:04:49.539> than<00:04:49.990> having<00:04:50.380> a<00:04:50.470> higher

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
more beneficial than having a higher

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.779 
more beneficial than having a higher
blue<00:04:50.919> total<00:04:52.139> that<00:04:53.139> being<00:04:53.349> said<00:04:53.590> with<00:04:53.860> that<00:04:53.889> 230

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:54.789 
blue total that being said with that 230

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:57.779

bleed compared to the compared to the
158<00:04:58.419> that's<00:04:58.900> definitely<00:04:59.530> a<00:04:59.560> lot<00:04:59.889> more<00:05:00.190> likely

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
158 that's definitely a lot more likely

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.930 
158 that's definitely a lot more likely
to<00:05:00.639> have<00:05:01.180> the<00:05:01.300> bolita<00:05:01.509> activate<00:05:02.110> so<00:05:02.979> it's<00:05:03.580> hard

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
to have the bolita activate so it's hard

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.210 
to have the bolita activate so it's hard
to<00:05:04.030> say<00:05:04.330> what<00:05:04.870> actually<00:05:05.470> is<00:05:05.710> going<00:05:06.009> to<00:05:06.130> be

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
to say what actually is going to be

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.080 
to say what actually is going to be
better<00:05:06.580> for<00:05:06.910> that<00:05:06.970> in<00:05:07.389> this<00:05:07.630> case<00:05:08.340> now<00:05:09.340> I<00:05:09.759> would

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
better for that in this case now I would

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:11.760 
better for that in this case now I would
have<00:05:10.120> to<00:05:10.270> say<00:05:10.449> the<00:05:10.810> biggest<00:05:10.990> pro<00:05:11.410> of<00:05:11.590> this

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
have to say the biggest pro of this

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.129 
have to say the biggest pro of this
weapon<00:05:11.949> would<00:05:12.759> definitely<00:05:13.150> be<00:05:13.270> the<00:05:13.300> fact<00:05:13.960> that

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:14.139 
weapon would definitely be the fact that

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:15.570 
weapon would definitely be the fact that
it's<00:05:14.289> got<00:05:14.380> a<00:05:14.440> twin<00:05:14.800> blade<00:05:14.949> moveset<00:05:15.400> that

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
it's got a twin blade moveset that

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.330 
it's got a twin blade moveset that
builds<00:05:15.880> up<00:05:15.940> damage<00:05:16.300> very<00:05:16.599> quickly<00:05:16.690> and

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
builds up damage very quickly and

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.409 
builds up damage very quickly and
definitely<00:05:18.340> does<00:05:18.669> make<00:05:18.910> up<00:05:19.090> for<00:05:19.210> the<00:05:19.270> fact

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419 
definitely does make up for the fact

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:20.939 
definitely does make up for the fact
that<00:05:19.539> it<00:05:19.690> does<00:05:19.870> have<00:05:20.080> a<00:05:20.110> relatively<00:05:20.680> low

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:20.949 
that it does have a relatively low

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:25.529 
that it does have a relatively low
damage<00:05:21.250> output<00:05:23.460> other<00:05:24.460> than<00:05:24.729> that<00:05:25.000> I<00:05:25.270> mean

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:25.539 
damage output other than that I mean

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:27.839 
damage output other than that I mean
compared<00:05:26.050> to<00:05:26.169> a<00:05:26.199> standard<00:05:26.710> twin<00:05:26.860> blade<00:05:27.099> if<00:05:27.340> you

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:27.849 
compared to a standard twin blade if you

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:29.730 
compared to a standard twin blade if you
infuse<00:05:28.210> a<00:05:28.270> standard<00:05:28.840> twin<00:05:29.020> blade<00:05:29.229> with<00:05:29.380> bleed

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 
infuse a standard twin blade with bleed

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.700 
infuse a standard twin blade with bleed
you'll<00:05:30.669> do<00:05:31.300> more<00:05:31.539> damage<00:05:31.780> with<00:05:32.080> this<00:05:32.320> weapon

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710 
you'll do more damage with this weapon

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.969 
you'll do more damage with this weapon
by<00:05:33.039> about<00:05:33.490> 100<00:05:34.000> attack<00:05:34.570> rating<00:05:34.870> but<00:05:35.830> you'll

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:35.979 
by about 100 attack rating but you'll

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:37.920 
by about 100 attack rating but you'll
have<00:05:36.130> 14<00:05:36.580> less<00:05:36.789> bleed<00:05:37.090> than<00:05:37.300> a<00:05:37.419> bleed<00:05:37.690> twin

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:37.930 
have 14 less bleed than a bleed twin

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.249 
have 14 less bleed than a bleed twin
blade<00:05:38.139> +10<00:05:38.729> so<00:05:39.729> it's<00:05:40.150> a<00:05:40.419> it's<00:05:40.810> a<00:05:40.900> trade<00:05:41.110> off

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:41.259 
blade +10 so it's a it's a trade off

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:43.529 
blade +10 so it's a it's a trade off
really<00:05:41.639> honestly<00:05:42.639> I'd<00:05:42.849> rather<00:05:43.060> go<00:05:43.270> with<00:05:43.300> this

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:43.539 
really honestly I'd rather go with this

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:44.760 
really honestly I'd rather go with this
if<00:05:43.690> I'm<00:05:43.840> trying<00:05:44.110> to<00:05:44.169> bleed<00:05:44.349> someone<00:05:44.620> with<00:05:44.740> a

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
if I'm trying to bleed someone with a

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.779 
if I'm trying to bleed someone with a
twin<00:05:44.979> blade<00:05:45.190> class<00:05:45.639> weapon<00:05:46.060> so<00:05:46.419> there's<00:05:46.840> that

00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:47.789 
twin blade class weapon so there's that

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:50.670 
twin blade class weapon so there's that
other<00:05:48.789> than<00:05:49.120> that<00:05:49.330> there<00:05:50.080> really<00:05:50.349> isn't

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:50.680 
other than that there really isn't

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.499 
other than that there really isn't
anything<00:05:51.099> else<00:05:51.370> worth<00:05:51.610> mentioning<00:05:51.699> it<00:05:52.300> does

00:05:52.499 --> 00:05:52.509 
anything else worth mentioning it does

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:54.180 
anything else worth mentioning it does
use<00:05:52.750> twinkling<00:05:53.110> titanite<00:05:53.289> to<00:05:53.620> upgrade<00:05:53.949> so<00:05:54.099> it
