00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.830 
ever drive it stops the stopping power
is<00:01:52.860> unbelievable<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.790> it<00:01:54.240> really<00:01:54.480> is<00:01:54.600> all

sounds new really but it is everything

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.400 
sounds new really but it is everything
about<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.820> car<00:02:00.000> tools<00:02:00.270> here<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.840> steering<00:02:01.290> is

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:01.410 
about the car tools here the steering is

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:02.900 
about the car tools here the steering is
as<00:02:01.590> direct<00:02:01.980> as<00:02:02.160> it<00:02:02.310> could<00:02:02.460> possibly<00:02:02.580> be

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:02.910 
as direct as it could possibly be

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.910 
as direct as it could possibly be
without<00:02:03.360> being<00:02:03.690> heavy<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.470> brakes<00:02:04.740> are

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
without being heavy the brakes are

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.830 
without being heavy the brakes are
precisely<00:02:05.220> the<00:02:05.460> same<00:02:05.640> they're<00:02:05.850> non<00:02:06.060> servo<00:02:06.630> and

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
precisely the same they're non servo and

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.690 
precisely the same they're non servo and
the<00:02:07.530> more<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:07.950> apply<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.250> pressure

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
the more you apply the pressure

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.880 
the more you apply the pressure
sounds<00:02:09.060> obvious<00:02:09.210> the<00:02:10.050> more<00:02:10.200> it'll<00:02:10.440> break<00:02:10.590> for

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
sounds obvious the more it'll break for

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.350 
sounds obvious the more it'll break for
you<00:02:11.040> but<00:02:11.190> until<00:02:11.460> you've<00:02:11.580> really<00:02:11.880> smelled<00:02:12.210> a

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
you but until you've really smelled a

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.510 
you but until you've really smelled a

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
proper braking system like this we don't

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.390 
proper braking system like this we don't
know<00:02:14.700> what<00:02:14.850> it's<00:02:15.000> like<00:02:15.060> it's<00:02:15.510> an<00:02:15.720> absolutely

a<00:02:36.700> bit<00:02:36.879> more<00:02:37.000> power<00:02:37.470> so<00:02:38.549> we've<00:02:39.549> increased<00:02:40.120> the

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
a bit more power so we've increased the

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.949 
a bit more power so we've increased the
power<00:02:40.540> we've<00:02:41.049> changed<00:02:41.620> the<00:02:41.769> gear<00:02:41.890> ratios<00:02:42.400> so

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
power we've changed the gear ratios so

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.809 
power we've changed the gear ratios so
there<00:02:43.959> are<00:02:44.110> more<00:02:44.739> sporty<00:02:45.310> if<00:02:45.459> you<00:02:45.579> can<00:02:45.700> believe

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
that a more sporty type gear ratios

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.509 
that a more sporty type gear ratios
which<00:02:49.780> is<00:02:49.989> very<00:02:50.440> very<00:02:50.620> well<00:02:50.890> suited<00:02:51.129> to<00:02:51.340> the

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
which is very very well suited to the

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.300 
which is very very well suited to the
engine<00:02:51.989> characteristics<00:02:52.989> and<00:02:53.170> we've<00:02:54.099> made

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
engine characteristics and we've made

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.220 
engine characteristics and we've made
subtle<00:02:54.670> other<00:02:55.060> changes<00:02:55.540> throughout<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:56.049> car
