 good service and this particular 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.859
 the store gave me a second account 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.710
 battlefield 4 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.080

 you pepe unusual video format for 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.560
 the channel is true but I have repeatedly 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.539
 said he would like to change the perception 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.730
 guides so today you can 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.829
 watch me on my monitors 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.129
 Well, questions like I look like 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.230
 well, something like that and also 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.320
 only the successor depends on you 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.040
 I made triples in this format 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.200
 you can vote in a group 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.820
 VKontakte but let's start the guide itself 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.270
 if you remember my first roller 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.550
 tried fil was a guide on aas in and also i 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.039
 already touched on the topic of this weapon in 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.379
 battlefield 4 but that video wasnâ€™t 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.690
 guide I just told the feeling of 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.059
 this weapon but here as you understand 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.460
 I will tell you completely about the weapon let's talk about 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.680
 characteristics as well as foot and scold oak 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.510
 I would like to start with the weapons that 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.290
 inspired me to make guides by 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.119
 battlefield 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.250
 as usual let's start with real 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.460
 characteristics of the history of the weapon itself 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.979
 caliber 9 39 millimeters length 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.259
 barrel with the butt spread out 875 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.420
 millimeters sighting range 400 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.540
 meters weight two and a half kilograms 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.640
 no store but the capacity of the store itself 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.340
 make up 10 or 20 rounds 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.070
 full name machine special shaft 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.619
 you heard that right is not automatic, I 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.110
 I already know what the hell days they shove him 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.170
 in the second game pdf class 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.659
 but was realized in the second half of the 1980s 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.939
 years and was intended mainly for 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.890
 listen to special purpose machine 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.110
 was created based on a special 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.899
 sniper rifle vss screw cutter 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.630
 but let's finish the story 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.180
 already to the guide with me 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.340
 cream to open us this weapon to us 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.299
 you will need the add-ons first 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.490
 santos 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:06.920
 Well, or just buy a premium that 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.599
 the easiest way to do the following is that you 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.360
 need to do this perform two simple 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:12.380
 jobs is to fix it 10 times the technique 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.440
 his squad 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.030
 and spend 10 minutes the most helicopter 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.310
 easy way to complete this task 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.890
 put your friend in reconnaissance 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.930
 the helicopter he sits down starts flying by 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.239
 card and you just put on an empty 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.370
 place and mend and its constantly ie 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:30.410
 this way in about 10 minutes you 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.750
 will be able to perform the task but in the extreme 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.069
 the case of twenty minutes is also worth 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.099
 note that from the shaft is 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:38.510
 exclusive weapon battlefield 4 he 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:40.940
 has a fixed silencer 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.099
 but crossed the characteristics in the game damage 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.280
 maximum 30 applies at a distance 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:49.069
 up to eight meters and a minimum of 16 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.079
 applied at a distance after 50 meters 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.500
 firing rate of nine hundred shots 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:54.110
 a minute 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.769
 recharge full will take you 2.9 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:03:00.440
 seconds and tactical one integer 95 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:01.910
 hundredths of a second store for 20 rounds but 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.579
 plus one more trunk 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:08.269
 also recoil is vertical but he sat down 4 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:10.670
 ten and horizontal minus 0,4 left 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:13.430
 and right 0.1 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:16.100
 if you do not take into account the impe 45 then a 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.030
 the shaft are are assisted barrel in 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.370
 classroom pdv 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.650
 Yes, and the main feature of the shaft is 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.600
 his rate of fire she is like 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.989
 do you remember nine hundred shots per minute 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:29.420
 but with such and such damage it's just a meat grinder 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.819
 at close range but also the main advantage 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.579
 score and also is its recharge 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:37.130
 she is a very small animation she is just 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:39.560
 divinely but also minuses it is very 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:41.510
 small shop for 20 rounds but also 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.850
 recoil which will not allow you to shoot 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.359
 over long distances as it was in this 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.980
 the filter 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:48.440
 and now let's take a look at 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.750
 return only at the site in the first 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.150
 case I shoot a clip and no way 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.819
 trying to control returns and end up 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.010
 we are 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:59.189
 that the first shot leaves us right 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.590
 the second one is slightly higher and the next one is 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:02.969
 goes to the upper right corner in the second 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.670
 case I tried to control 

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:07.680
 recoil for this I pulled the mouse over and 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.260
 slightly left respectively for 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.810
 better control and we see that this 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:16.199
 much better than previous results but 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:18.660
 we can also improve it by the third 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:21.359
 case I shot misfires on 23 rounds and 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.160
 accuracy has increased many times but remember 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:25.710
 you need this option for medium 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.310
 I do not advise you to be the first to go away 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.410
 enjoy 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.479
 but the second you need for your neighbors 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.610
 exclusively for short distances 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:34.470
 also worth noting the excellent shooting 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.539
 from the hip well and now it is worth taking a look at 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.160
 the module that I want to advise you 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:40.740
 on sight we set collimator 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.080
 we put coyote or cobra on accessories 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.690
 we already have a father on the trunk 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.910
 silencer but also on the under-barrel module we 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.759
 put the handle potato or short 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.680
 what is the same 

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:54.570
 coyote cobra is two more open and 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.419
 comfortable sight so advise 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.860
 put you them from here and the hall is more 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:01.139
 effective hip shooting 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.979
 standard muffler doesn't burn you on 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:04.380
 mini map 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:06.389
 Well, the handle that I advise you 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.699
 she is very good at her enemies 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:11.130
 in the middle distance but also on this 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:14.039
 Basically, I put all this trunk 4 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:16.199
 stars out of 5 since this weapon is not very 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:18.630
 suitable for open cards and i don't 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:21.060
 I advise you to use it there better 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:23.190
 go to small cards like locker 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:26.220
 or the latest addition of dragon this 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.840
 very good for this I think 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.570
 you understand why I put this 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.880
 appreciation and would certainly not agree with her 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:35.130
 and now I ask you to go to my 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.320
 VKontakte group to vote 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:39.210
 and also write in the comment modules 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.520

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.080
 and also i would like to hear from you 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.509
 Do I have to do exactly here in this format 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:48.360
 data clips and and return to 

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:50.370
 the usual star but if you liked
