 she washes people or her and her well 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.299
 coming to another trailer and today I'm going 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.250
 speak science today day of you 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.340
 know your brain a little better 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.900
 or better to know more how it works and 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.250
 I'm going to pass a test for you 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.010
 reveal if you are a creative person 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.800
 who acts by curious instinct 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.179
 if you have a car inside or it 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.640
 will show if you are a person who 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.550
 rules the rationality to 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.590
 logical strategy did not understand wait there 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.870
 that I will explain our brain is 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.050
 divided by two hemispheres the left 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.210
 right on the right side of the brain 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.940
 reserved for functions you use 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.649
 our curiosity and creativity is 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.590
 where our artistic sensitivity lives 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.539
 or our instinct already the left side 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.620
 of the brain is responsible for 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.750
 rationality 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.609
 logic the details language 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.140
 strategy this theory about the 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.500
 hemispheres of the brain appeared in the 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.299
 60 when psychologists roger sperry and 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.549
 michael said annika got 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.170
 stimulate only one ministry at a time and 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.939
 found that the two halves of the 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.369
 brain acted as entities 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.040
 with different styles of 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.590
 then the theory 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.930
 diego would have why many scientists 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.970
 disagree but whatever theory says that a 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.729
 these sides always prevails over the 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.549
 other people or an individual 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.390
 right side may be more dominant 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:31.140
 providing an artistic capacity 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.549
 bigger 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.049
 the person may be more connected to the image 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.909
 of fantasy 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.979
 already in others the left side is more 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.229
 dominant position by making the person more 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.090
 rational logical strategist and 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.280
 usually these people tend to like 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.140
 more science or math and that's it 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.250
 which ultimately determines much of its 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.540
 personality 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.729
 now let's go to a test that I would 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.920
 leave the description and it is very simple 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.439
 asks for example that you have chosen a 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.180
 color and word or question what is the 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.710
 image that draws more attention 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.930
 You have four seconds to respond. 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.119
 each question and the instantaneous response is 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.890
 important for the result as they can 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.960
 see I did the test and my result 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.429
 that I have a balanced brain but 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.000
 do not be surprised if there is a large 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.920
 discrepancy and 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.990
 the hemispheres of your brain studies 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.730
 Recent show that in fact the 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.190
 two hemispheres work together for the 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.110
 solving our day-to-day tasks 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.270
 The fact that you have the right side more 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.370
 developed or you are more 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.800
 imaginative than logical does not make you 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.690
 for example a poor strategist 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.090
 as I said in some videos in our 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.070
 brain is super complex and a division 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.440
 simple as this campaign summing up 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.330
 wrong way the full potential of the 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.010
 our gray matter this test can 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.470
 end up determining a trend of the 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.030
 our brain but in practice it is 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.680
 much more complicated 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.300
 Are you a more creative person? 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.830
 or is a more logical person 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.810
 leave in the comments the result that 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.400
 gave him his test and come this video 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.450
 stay here if you liked him 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.980
 I did not like it down here. 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.510
 I remind you that the polygons do not 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.770
 they are only on youtube but we are also 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.959
 spread across all social networks 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.610
 possible but we have a gana account follows 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.470
 There to see behind the scenes explains 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.810
 notes we also have a facebook account 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.739
 and we also have twitter accounts that 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.420
 They are down here. 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.860
 just stay there and not follow and if you 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.580
 likes pop culture cinema comics 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.250
 etc 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.350
 also visit www political point on 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.850
 dispute with the site the pilots who is 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.530
 updated all the time all good all 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.220
 In a moment and five defeats I'm staying 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.780
 around here 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.780
 A big hug and see you there
