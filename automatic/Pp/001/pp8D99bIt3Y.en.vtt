now<00:00:11.040> let's<00:00:11.190> discuss<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.550> operation<00:00:12.090> of<00:00:12.150> a

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
now let's discuss the operation of a

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.060 
now let's discuss the operation of a
solenoid<00:00:12.510> we<00:00:13.440> may<00:00:13.559> have<00:00:13.680> heard<00:00:13.889> of<00:00:13.980> the

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
solenoid we may have heard of the

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.120 
solenoid we may have heard of the
solenoid<00:00:14.780> used<00:00:15.780> in<00:00:15.990> a<00:00:16.110> starting<00:00:16.500> circuit<00:00:16.860> such

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
solenoid used in a starting circuit such

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.279 
solenoid used in a starting circuit such
as<00:00:17.279> a<00:00:17.310> car<00:00:17.670> or<00:00:17.699> boat<00:00:18.210> but<00:00:18.840> maybe<00:00:19.050> there's<00:00:19.199> some

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
as a car or boat but maybe there's some

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.260 
as a car or boat but maybe there's some
ambiguity<00:00:19.560> as<00:00:20.010> to<00:00:20.039> what<00:00:20.430> it<00:00:20.520> actually<00:00:20.550> is<00:00:20.910> a

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
ambiguity as to what it actually is a

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.929 
ambiguity as to what it actually is a
solenoid<00:00:22.140> is<00:00:22.800> a<00:00:22.890> magnetically<00:00:23.400> actuated

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
solenoid is a magnetically actuated

device from a remote location it sounds

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.909 
device from a remote location it sounds
complicated<00:00:29.580> but<00:00:30.119> let's<00:00:30.329> discuss<00:00:30.810> it<00:00:30.990> without

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:31.919 
complicated but let's discuss it without

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:33.950 
complicated but let's discuss it without
a<00:00:32.009> solenoid<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.850> start<00:00:33.090> an<00:00:33.180> engine<00:00:33.420> we<00:00:33.750> need<00:00:33.780> a

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
a solenoid to start an engine we need a

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.140 
a solenoid to start an engine we need a
heavy<00:00:34.230> cable<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:35.010> large<00:00:35.280> switch<00:00:35.730> at<00:00:36.000> the

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:36.150 
heavy cable and a large switch at the

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.590 
heavy cable and a large switch at the
console<00:00:36.630> of<00:00:36.720> the<00:00:36.780> boat<00:00:36.989> not<00:00:37.739> very<00:00:37.980> practical

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
console of the boat not very practical

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.620 
console of the boat not very practical
instead<00:00:39.600> we<00:00:40.170> use<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.380> small<00:00:40.680> key<00:00:41.130> switch<00:00:41.630> small

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:42.630 
instead we use a small key switch small

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.710 
instead we use a small key switch small
gauge<00:00:42.780> wire<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.620> solenoid<00:00:44.390> when<00:00:45.390> we<00:00:45.510> turn

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:45.720 
gauge wire and a solenoid when we turn

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.590 
gauge wire and a solenoid when we turn
the<00:00:45.900> switch<00:00:46.190> we<00:00:47.190> allow<00:00:47.400> power<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.910> travel<00:00:48.330> to

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
the switch we allow power to travel to

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.810 
the switch we allow power to travel to
the<00:00:48.720> solenoid<00:00:49.140> coil<00:00:49.910> here<00:00:52.070> when<00:00:53.070> power<00:00:53.310> passes

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
the solenoid coil here when power passes

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.880 
the solenoid coil here when power passes
through<00:00:54.060> this<00:00:54.180> coil<00:00:54.540> the<00:00:55.080> coil<00:00:55.320> becomes<00:00:55.680> a

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
through this coil the coil becomes a

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.720 
through this coil the coil becomes a
magnet<00:00:56.390> let's<00:00:57.390> take<00:00:57.630> a<00:00:57.660> look<00:00:57.990> at<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.730> internal

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
magnet let's take a look at the internal

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.780 
magnet let's take a look at the internal
workings<00:01:00.210> of<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.810> solenoid<00:01:01.370> okay<00:01:02.370> so<00:01:02.430> here<00:01:02.700> we

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:02.790 
workings of a solenoid okay so here we

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:08.740 
workings of a solenoid okay so here we
have<00:01:02.880> a<00:01:02.910> cutaway<00:01:03.799> so<00:01:06.350> inside<00:01:07.350> this<00:01:07.470> magnet<00:01:07.979> in

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
have a cutaway so inside this magnet in

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:17.859 
have a cutaway so inside this magnet in
here<00:01:09.750> is<00:01:10.130> a<00:01:11.130> metal<00:01:11.609> slug<00:01:12.030> called<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.689> plunger

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.990 

when<00:01:18.869> we<00:01:18.990> send<00:01:19.259> energy<00:01:19.439> recent<00:01:20.100> power<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.880> this

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
when we send energy recent power to this

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.840 
when we send energy recent power to this
magnet<00:01:21.539> to<00:01:22.110> this<00:01:22.229> coil<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.649> wire<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:23.460> creates<00:01:23.729> a

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
magnet to this coil of wire it creates a

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.789 
magnet to this coil of wire it creates a
magnet<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.590> the<00:01:25.590> slug<00:01:25.979> is<00:01:26.280> thrust<00:01:26.729> upwards

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
magnet and the slug is thrust upwards

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:29.870 
magnet and the slug is thrust upwards
let's<00:01:28.799> take<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.009> look<00:01:29.219> and<00:01:29.340> see<00:01:29.490> what<00:01:29.579> happens

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
let's take a look and see what happens

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:40.719 
let's take a look and see what happens
when<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.119> solenoid<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:30.570> energized

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.060 

when<00:01:41.729> its<00:01:41.850> thrust<00:01:42.119> upwards<00:01:42.509> it<00:01:42.899> makes<00:01:43.409> contact

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
when its thrust upwards it makes contact

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.080 
when its thrust upwards it makes contact
between<00:01:44.970> these<00:01:45.119> two<00:01:45.420> heavy<00:01:46.020> posts<00:01:46.649> on<00:01:46.939> top<00:01:47.939> of

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
between these two heavy posts on top of

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.919 
between these two heavy posts on top of
the<00:01:48.210> solenoid<00:01:50.119> when<00:01:51.119> this<00:01:51.360> when<00:01:51.780> this

00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:51.929 
the solenoid when this when this

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:54.679 
the solenoid when this when this
