00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.249
 Hello everyone, how are you? 

00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:05.319
 very well today today 

00:00:03.249 --> 00:00:06.669
 I bring a quick videotutorial of how 

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:08.620
 delete your games from a tour net 

00:00:06.669 --> 00:00:10.720
 this great game that is becoming 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.880
 very popular lately we can not 

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.220
 get off the steam platform is a game 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.740
 free to play totally free to which 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:19.210
 we can contribute for 5 dollars one that 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.660
 give us a premium version of the game 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.900
 where we will have more weapons and more clothes 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.789
 for our character is not like that 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.939
 and well the game is pretty good I 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.619
 I 've played it almost 50 hours and the only 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.180
 problem that I have seen the game is that 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.760
 you do not have a way to remove your map 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.280
 from within the game there is no way 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.680
 to eliminate it then looking around 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.870
 find a way to eliminate your 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.940
 game or save it to play it later 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.829
 with your friends or things like that if you want 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.870
 start over from scratch 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.570
 and well I tried to eliminate the game 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.210
 I eliminated him, I gave him many things 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.489
 but none worked to perform 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.500
 the map then the way to do it is 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.210
 the next one we're going to go to the key 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.190
 on our keyboard to the track the 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.660
 windows the one that opens the start button 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.280
 is 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:10.770
 then we will see windows will we r ok 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.260
 to open this little box to execute that 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.250
 is going to put us here in regedit is going to 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.450
 put here in the description what 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.900
 you have to write the gift here 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:22.020
 and we will accept 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.530
 and you have to leave us here is this 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.510
 window 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.490
 and in this little window what we are going to do 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:30.070
 is to go to this folder that is called 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.560
 current user that is where all 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.530
 our information of everything we have 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.880
 saved from our profile once here 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.220
 we are going to go to the software folder 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.720
 which is where all our are 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.409
 now yes that the programs that are not 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.290
 they are strong and we will go down until 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:49.240
 let's find the folder that is called 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.549

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:55.420

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.300
 well on a net tour this is our life 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.920
 is so to speak the game if they want 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.070
 you save your map you click 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.070
 straight 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.410
 here where it says export 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.350
 then export to the desktop and what 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.580
 they keep or if they want to eliminate it already from 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.990
 flat eliminate everything they have done 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.320
 to start over we're going to give 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:21.670

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.910

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.580
 Now we can go to one shift 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.580
 open it 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.920

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.920

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.250

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.069
 application running 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:43.659
 and good and here is his departure 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:43.659
 as you see everything works normal 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.550
 and good and everything you have 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.500
 fact they will be removed from their maps 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.390
 also the settings changed 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.800
 the keyboard settings also 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.590
 they will be deleted because they are also 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.930
 inside the napkin 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.030
 but good is the only way to go back to 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.440
 start from scratch and I hope you have them 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.760

 with his friends so that they too 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:09.730
