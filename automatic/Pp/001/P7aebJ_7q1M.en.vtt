00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:12.140
 a short moment of inattention 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.140
 and already it happened 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.300
 this trap is obviously only 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.310
 the bumper tatters the evil 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.929
 awakening sometimes comes only at the 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.789
 repair if high technical 

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:26.240
 components like distance or 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.249
 radar sensors were damaged 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.999
 cost as a few thousand euros make up 

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:32.579
 can 

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:35.550
 the adac has a test 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.859
 performed because of this try 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.690
 we investigate trivial damage that is 

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:42.000
 an accident at a low 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.859
 collision speed these 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.320
 trivial damage at the 

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:48.600
 car accidents in a large proportion 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.870
 The insurances are 80 percent 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.300
 the damage reports in the area under 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.910
 2500 euro we know that newer systems 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.420
 say 10 and headlights or radar 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.980
 sensors for adaptive cruise control 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.820
 can cause very high costs 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.019
 we also know that the 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.540
 price differences between individual 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.799
 manufacturers are very big and that's why 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.920
 We took this examination 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.990
 focused on these systems in these 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.700
 components is the problem that they have 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.270
 mounted directly on the vehicle front 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.200
 are 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.640
 that means the probability 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.149
 that you in a rear-end collision 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.799
 damaged is very large and at 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:24.630
 many manufacturers it is so soon there 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.430
 a holder has broken off that 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.590
 complete part be replaced because it 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.210
 No repairs were made 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.920
 situation for such 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.920
 trivial accident is just here 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.950
 prepared in this test bounces 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.479
 car with one in the front 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:43.170
 mounted radar sensor on a stationary 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.880
 vehicle with a coverage of 100 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.490
 percent is the speed 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.200
 doing only 10 km h as you for example 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.749
 in a light rear-end collision 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.799
 will occur 

00:01:51.749 --> 00:02:01.960
 first the impact in real 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:02:04.060
 speed only in slow motion 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.590
 you can see which forces already at 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:10.750
 such a low speed 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:12.299
 Occurrence on the bonnet is clear 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.519
 to watch how the energy 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:17.890
 is undulated 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:19.780
 at this slight rear-end accident at 10 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.650
 km h is a considerable damage 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.170
 arose 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.790
 already from the outside one recognizes that the 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.910
 bumper is damaged 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.540
 The bonnet is bent and also the 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.349
 Grille is broken 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:37.410
 you look behind the radiator grille 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:39.239
 one recognizes also that the sensor for the 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.569
 Adaptive cruise control the radar sensor 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.510
 is damaged 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.859
 both halters are broken off this 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.629
 very expensive components 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:49.510
 It costs up to depending on the vehicle manufacturer 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:51.030
 to 3500 euro must be after this accident 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.349
 be replaced 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.299
 unfortunately it stayed with this one 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:57.579
 low impact speed not 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:59.709
 only at the damaged sensor there was 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:02.920
 In addition, even more costly 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.359
 Defective on the front part of this 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.269
 test were both headlights 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:09.000
 damaged on both sides are holders 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.799
 canceled 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.480
 depending on the vehicle manufacturer must here 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:16.209
 Complete headlights are replaced 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.519
 only a few vehicle manufacturers are 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.079
 Repairs were available from those 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:20.440
 the holders are replaced individually 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:22.870
 can 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.480
 In this case , such holders are 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.730
 Available that is the headlights 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.799
 do not have to be completely renewed 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.569
 expensive components on the vehicle should be like that 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:34.450
 be positioned at one 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:36.160
 accident can not break if 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.510
 these from engineering technical 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.220
 founding is not possible if one 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.319
 component really at the front 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.970
 must be mounted 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:44.349
 Should be a repair kit available 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.120
 So that means that if a holder 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:47.859
 should break off this one by one 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.540
 can be exchanged the expensive 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:50.500
 components themselves can then continue 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.450
 be used 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.459
 This can be the cost for 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.269
 insurance and repair costs 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:57.269
 be lowered significantly
