 parishioners who lived far away could 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.900
 go to mass and stay to sleep today in

 first hand the current traditions 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.550
 of the Swedish Lapland one of them from the 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:34.800
 better known are the so-called lodges 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.750

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:51.140
 Another tradition that is worth 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:54.320

 Swedish lapland next to the circle 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:33.540
 polar and we have 24 hours of sunlight 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:36.090
 and it really affects the lives of the Swedes 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:37.620
 because after the sun appears and 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:40.670
 begins to make good time the life 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.670
