00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
fanservice

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.590 
fanservice
there<00:00:22.439> are<00:00:22.590> many<00:00:22.890> levels<00:00:23.220> of<00:00:23.609> fanservice<00:00:24.330> and

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
there are many levels of fanservice and

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.240 
there are many levels of fanservice and
I<00:00:24.720> think<00:00:24.990> it's<00:00:25.109> important<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.800> distinguish

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
I think it's important to distinguish

between<00:00:26.660> fanservice<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:28.050> nudity<00:00:28.470> and

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
between fanservice and nudity and

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.970 
between fanservice and nudity and
although<00:00:29.369> anime<00:00:30.000> is<00:00:30.119> fundamentally<00:00:31.080> separate

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
although anime is fundamentally separate

although anime is fundamentally separate
from<00:00:32.189> reality<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.850> way<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.480> identify

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
from reality the way to identify

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.920 
from reality the way to identify
fanservice<00:00:34.500> is<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:35.850> look<00:00:36.180> at<00:00:36.390> it<00:00:36.600> in<00:00:36.809> a

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
fanservice is to look at it in a

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.440 
fanservice is to look at it in a
realistic<00:00:37.410> context<00:00:38.250> it's<00:00:38.640> about<00:00:38.879> identifying

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
realistic context it's about identifying

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.139 
realistic context it's about identifying
the<00:00:39.600> woman<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.350> identifying<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.370> role<00:00:41.640> that

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
the woman and identifying the role that

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.389 
the woman and identifying the role that

she's supposed to be in if she's a
promiscuous<00:00:44.989> prostitute<00:00:45.989> then<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.350> makes

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
promiscuous prostitute then it makes

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.229 
promiscuous prostitute then it makes
sense<00:00:46.950> that<00:00:47.100> her<00:00:47.250> boobs<00:00:47.489> are<00:00:47.640> hanging<00:00:48.000> out<00:00:48.059> and

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
that's not fanservice but if she's a

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.090 
that's not fanservice but if she's a
serious<00:00:51.030> analyst<00:00:51.660> or<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.320> freedom<00:00:52.890> fighter

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
then why are her boobs hanging out not

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.490 
then why are her boobs hanging out not
only<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.570> uncomfortable<00:00:57.570> but<00:00:58.050> it's<00:00:58.260> just

hope<00:04:05.760> that<00:04:06.120> it<00:04:06.720> doesn't<00:04:06.930> create<00:04:07.470> a<00:04:07.500> generation

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
hope that it doesn't create a generation

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.839 
hope that it doesn't create a generation
of<00:04:08.400> people<00:04:08.939> who<00:04:09.269> think<00:04:09.810> that<00:04:10.400> it's<00:04:11.400> okay<00:04:11.790> to

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 
of people who think that it's okay to

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:14.570 
of people who think that it's okay to
molest<00:04:12.299> women<00:04:12.390> or<00:04:13.319> when<00:04:13.739> you<00:04:13.860> walk<00:04:14.099> in<00:04:14.430> on<00:04:14.549> a

molest women or when you walk in on a
woman

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
woman

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.759 
woman
and<00:04:15.560> she's<00:04:15.980> not<00:04:16.670> fully<00:04:17.060> clothed<00:04:17.510> then<00:04:18.470> it<00:04:18.650> is

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
and she's not fully clothed then it is

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.250 
and she's not fully clothed then it is
humorous<00:04:19.160> rather<00:04:19.610> than<00:04:19.910> embarrassing<00:04:20.720> I<00:04:20.930> mean

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
humorous rather than embarrassing I mean

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.110 
humorous rather than embarrassing I mean
okay<00:04:21.560> maybe<00:04:21.860> that<00:04:22.070> did<00:04:22.250> end<00:04:22.400> up<00:04:22.580> sounding<00:04:22.820> a

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
okay maybe that did end up sounding a

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.910 
okay maybe that did end up sounding a
