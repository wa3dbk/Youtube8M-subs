00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
on air right now I'm not going to really

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.800 
on air right now I'm not going to really
share<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.369> with<00:01:20.600> everyone

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
share it with everyone

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.950 
share it with everyone
because<00:01:22.110> it's<00:01:22.290> just<00:01:22.530> for<00:01:22.770> this<00:01:23.960> training

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
because it's just for this training

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:32.600 
because it's just for this training
we're<00:01:25.140> going<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.350> call<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:26.630> test<00:01:30.020> and<00:01:31.020> test<00:01:31.610> and

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
we're going to call it test and test and

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.390 
we're going to call it test and test and
I'll<00:01:33.030> probably<00:01:33.240> just<00:01:33.780> put<00:01:34.110> my<00:01:34.590> friend<00:01:34.860> Dana<00:01:35.100> in

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.319 
I'll probably just put my friend Dana in
here<00:01:35.729> as<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.270> one<00:01:36.810> contact<00:01:37.439> I<00:01:38.119> find<00:01:39.119> that<00:01:39.210> it
