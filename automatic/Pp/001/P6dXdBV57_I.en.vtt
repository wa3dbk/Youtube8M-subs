00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.340
Tomorrow marks the second annual Doctor Who
Comics Day.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.050
Comic book shops around the world are getting
involved

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:12.120
there’ll be new ranges on sale, signings
and exclusive variant covers up for grabs

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:12.429
too.

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:16.690
We paid a visit to Titan’s headquarters
to speak to Range Editor Andrew James

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.289
to find out what’s on offer.

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.810
So first up, what is Doctor Who Comics Day?

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.179
Doctor Who Comics Day is sort of an international
celebration of Doctor Who and comics

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:32.800
It’s kind of an excuse to get comic book
stores all over the world to throw small parties

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.210
Get cosplayers in

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.930
Generally just have fun with the brand and
with the comics

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.720
And that there are Doctor Who fans all over
the world and they really want to celebrate

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.130
their passion

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.980
On Saturday 15th August people can go into
their local comic book store, pick up the

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:48.870
lynch pin of the event

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.980
Which is the first issue of our Doctor Who
event series of 2015

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.030
Four Doctors, written by Paul Cornell with
art by Neil Edwards and colours by Ivan Nunes

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.890
Fantastic

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.410
Comic book owners will be there to guide them
through the many titles that we’ve got

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.030
And sort of say this is a great jumping on
point, try this out

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.579
But yeah, there will be activities, quizzes
and all that sort of stuff

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:10.960
It’s just a great excuse for a party and
it’s another way of celebrating and also

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.140
thanking retailers and readers

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.600
That have been so supportive of us in our
first year of printing Doctor Who comics.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.530
So what can you tell us about Paul Cornell’s
Four Doctors?

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.909
Well, it’s the first ever crossover between
Doctors Ten, Eleven and Twelve in any medium

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.619
Ten is incredibly suspicious of Twelve because
he doesn’t believe he should actually exist

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.429
From his perspective, this man should not
be here

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:38.869
Eleven is sort of relieved to find that he
does actually carry on going

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:43.689
He’s almost the peacemaker between Ten and
Twelve while their at each other’s throats

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:49.109
Ten calls him famously, an ‘abomination’
to Twelve and Twelve is like ‘a Dalek word,

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.439
nice.’

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.960
And if you know anything about Doctor Who
since 2005 you’ll have an absolute blast

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.380
with it.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.560
Christel.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.740
CHRISTEL!

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.520
Oh! Sorry, this is really rather good.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.799
But with all these comics, where on Gallifrey
does one start?

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:08.509
Luckily for us, TV presenter, Doctor Who fan
and comic book enthusiast, Chris Johnson,

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.709
is on hand to help us out.

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.550
Man, we got spoiled in 2013 didn’t we?

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.140
Big Finish’s extravaganza The Light At The
End, a shiny new Peter Capaldi to look forward

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.800
to

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.850
And some television special called The Day
of the Doctor or whatever, you might have

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:22.410
heard of it

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.420
But also we were treated to a 12 issue event
from IDW called Prisoners of Time.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.750
Featuring the first 11 incarnations of the
Doctor being perused throughout history alongside

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:32.510
his companions

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.210
By a mysterious figure hell bent on revenge

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.130
Every issue you find out more about what this
person could be

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.180
Hopefully, the Doctor did too

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.880
Highlights? The Eighth Doctor reunites with
Grace.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.900
The Eleventh faces of against the Anthony
Ainley incarnation of the Master.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.050
The Fourth Doctor encounters the Judoon.

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.890
The 10th Doctor fights the Quarks.

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.210
And Frobisher is in it and I absolutely love
Frobisher.

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.640
Doctor Who, the Ninth Doctor hot on the heels
of their three on-going Doctor Who titles

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.700
the mighty team at Titan bring us

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.240
The Ninth Doctor limited series. This is a
sheer delight to read.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.780
Bringing back to life one of the most popular,
if short lived TARDIS trios in Doctor Who

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:14.450
history

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.130
In a brand new story

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.080
The Time War may have ended but the Ninth
Doctor has plenty of work to do yet

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.880
Cavan Scott captures the characters voices
perfectly in this story that follows on directly

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:25.750
from the events

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.150
Of The Doctor Dances back in Series 1

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.510
With artwork by Blair Shedd and Rachel Stott
bringing these characters to glorious life

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.910
It’s amazing to finally see the Ninth Doctor
– my Doctor

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.010
Rose Tyler and Captain Jack Harkness in a
brand new story that’s still going on to

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.600
this day

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.900
Whatever Doctor Who graphic novel takes your
fancy, whichever one grabs your eye, give

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:44.400
it a try

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.030
They’re easy to leap into, they’re tonnes
of fun

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.070
And what’s more, it’s more Doctor Who
in your life

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:50.380
And when is that a bad thing?

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.180
Now if you don’t mind, I’m going to get
back to reading my comics

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:00.640
Show yourself out

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.680
Doctor Who comics wouldn’t be complete without
the incredible artwork.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.280
And some fans have made the leap from making
fan art to working on the comics themselves.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.920
Hi, my name is Rachel Stott, I’m a comic
book artist and I draw Doctor Who.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.389
So far I’ve done a little bit of Nine, a
little bit of Ten and then this year, well,

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:19.299
starting from next year

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:20.989
I’m going to be drawing the Twelfth Doctor

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:26.439
I had been hired because the publishers had
seen some of my Twelfth Doctor fan art on

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:27.819
like Tumblr and Twitter

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:32.689
And things like this and like being able to
draw something and knowing it’s like official

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:36.620
And it was going to be on the front cover
of a Doctor Who comic book really, really

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:37.129
exciting

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:41.620
I work digitally so basically I’ll receive
a script that looks like a movie script into

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.499
my email inbox

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:47.199
And yeah, read it. Figure out how you want
the story to go because most of the time it

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:47.430
just says

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.419
like dialogue and a little bit about what
the character should be doing in each panel

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:52.159
and things

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:56.110
and then you just draw it out on the tablet
just like you would with paper or pen

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.389
so you just sketch it out using blue for the
pencil line and sort of ink over the top of

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:00.520
it

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.370
And there you go

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.009
And then it gets sent off to another person
who colours it

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:09.099
Someone else after that who puts the dialogue
like the word balloons onto the top of it

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:12.650
And yeah, it gets printed out and it becomes
a beautiful comic book

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.050
I was a Doctor Who fan before starting drawing
the books

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.639
I’ve been watching it ever since Christopher
Eccleston’s first episode

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:20.219
and ever since then I’ve literally been
hooked on it.

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:23.270
It’s been my favorite TV show. I absolutely
adore it.

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.639
So the fact that I get to draw it is slightly
surreal and really, really fantastic.

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:32.509
My advice to budding comic book artists is
to draw as much as you can

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:34.620
Draw anything and everything

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:39.259
Draw from life especially because that’s
going to be really good practice for the future

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:42.449
For budding Doctor Who artists, drawing drom
life doesn’t mean

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:47.430
following Peter Capaldi and Jenna Coleman
around all the time because that’s not cool

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:53.370
You know if you draw like your living room,
the same also applies to when you draw a spaceship

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:56.370
It’s all just perspective and composition
and things like this

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.259
So yeah, just practice as much as you can.

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:03.129
And have passion for it as well because if
you draw whatever you think you’re meant

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:03.639
to draw

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:07.110
It might come out terrible because you’re
hearts not gonna be in it

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.550
Draw whatever comes to you and whatever you
want to and then it will turn out fantastic

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:14.699
And if it turns out terrible then you know
what to do next time to improve it

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:16.830
And get better and better and better

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:20.680
Until I can ready your comic books then that
will be great.
