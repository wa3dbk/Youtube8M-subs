fulfilling and so amazing but I took a

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.109

lot of time off to have children and I
really<00:01:36.450> discovered<00:01:37.020> another<00:01:37.770> side<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.340> myself

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
really discovered another side to myself

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.640 
really discovered another side to myself
during<00:01:39.030> those<00:01:39.390> years<00:01:39.450> when<00:01:40.049> I<00:01:40.110> was<00:01:40.259> home<00:01:40.470> with

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
during those years when I was home with

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.069 
during those years when I was home with
the<00:01:40.710> kids<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.340> being<00:01:41.970> very<00:01:42.210> very<00:01:42.390> domestic

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
the kids and being very very domestic

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.679 
the kids and being very very domestic
and<00:01:43.409> it<00:01:44.369> was<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.579> very<00:01:44.850> important<00:01:45.240> time<00:01:45.450> for<00:01:45.479> me

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
and it was a very important time for me

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.450 
and it was a very important time for me
and<00:01:45.869> I<00:01:45.930> feel<00:01:46.140> like<00:01:46.350> it<00:01:46.500> really<00:01:46.619> rounded<00:01:47.159> me<00:01:47.310> out

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
and I feel like it really rounded me out

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.859 
and I feel like it really rounded me out
as<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.790> human<00:01:48.149> being

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
as a human being

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.249 
as a human being
I<00:01:49.759> think<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:50.909> life<00:01:51.090> changes<00:01:51.539> are<00:01:51.659> essential

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
I think that life changes are essential

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.499 
I think that life changes are essential
for<00:01:52.289> our<00:01:52.679> growth<00:01:52.979> I<00:01:53.280> think<00:01:53.340> it's<00:01:53.700> so<00:01:53.939> important

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
for our growth I think it's so important

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.289 
for our growth I think it's so important
to<00:01:54.740> mix<00:01:55.740> things<00:01:56.009> up<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.579> to<00:01:56.700> see<00:01:56.909> things<00:01:57.090> from

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
to mix things up and to see things from

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.880 
to mix things up and to see things from
a<00:01:57.329> different<00:01:57.509> perspective<00:01:57.780> I<00:01:58.500> mean<00:01:58.649> we're<00:01:58.859> on

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
a different perspective I mean we're on

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.399 
a different perspective I mean we're on
earth<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.789> grow<00:02:00.719> and<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.020> be<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.380> best

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
earth to grow and to be the best

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.620 
earth to grow and to be the best
possible<00:02:02.369> versions<00:02:02.909> of<00:02:03.030> ourselves<00:02:03.179> that<00:02:03.479> we

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
possible versions of ourselves that we

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.050 
possible versions of ourselves that we
can<00:02:03.810> be<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.259> if<00:02:04.530> you<00:02:05.009> kind<00:02:05.219> of<00:02:05.280> are<00:02:05.549> stuck<00:02:05.909> in

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
can be and if you kind of are stuck in

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.630 
can be and if you kind of are stuck in
the<00:02:06.179> same<00:02:06.439> routine<00:02:07.439> every<00:02:07.709> single<00:02:08.310> day<00:02:08.459> you're

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
the same routine every single day you're

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.100 
the same routine every single day you're
never<00:02:08.819> really<00:02:09.000> going<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.299> shake<00:02:09.569> things<00:02:09.869> up

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
never really going to shake things up

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.830 
never really going to shake things up
for<00:02:10.530> yourself<00:02:10.950> so<00:02:11.220> I<00:02:11.430> think<00:02:11.700> it's<00:02:12.000> I<00:02:12.390> think
