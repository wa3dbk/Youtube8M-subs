but apart from that mines done and these
two<00:00:51.539> little<00:00:51.719> lights<00:00:52.020> here<00:00:52.320> cost<00:00:52.680> about<00:00:52.980> to

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
two little lights here cost about to

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.389 
two little lights here cost about to
pound<00:00:53.640> fifty<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.649> I'm<00:00:55.649> not<00:00:55.920> sure<00:00:56.100> about<00:00:56.129> the

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
pound fifty and I'm not sure about the

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.529 
pound fifty and I'm not sure about the
card<00:00:56.610> yet<00:00:56.850> i'll<00:00:56.940> probably<00:00:57.120> have<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.329> buy<00:00:57.510> a

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
card yet i'll probably have to buy a

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.959 
card yet i'll probably have to buy a
book<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.500> free<00:00:58.859> card<00:00:59.100> but<00:00:59.430> that'll<00:00:59.789> probably

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
book of a free card but that'll probably

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.189 
book of a free card but that'll probably
cost<00:01:00.570> about<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.840> pound<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:02.570> so<00:01:03.570> yeah<00:01:03.750> that's<00:01:03.930> it

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
cost about a pound and so yeah that's it

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.350 
cost about a pound and so yeah that's it
i<00:01:04.379> wouldn't<00:01:05.250> leave<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.489> lights<00:01:05.850> on<00:01:06.060> for<00:01:06.119> too

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
i wouldn't leave the lights on for too

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.760 
i wouldn't leave the lights on for too
long<00:01:06.570> because<00:01:06.720> obviously<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.200> is<00:01:07.320> cardboard

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
long because obviously it is cardboard

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.219 
long because obviously it is cardboard
so<00:01:08.310> if<00:01:09.060> they<00:01:09.270> were<00:01:09.330> on<00:01:09.479> for<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.720> while<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.110> the

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
so if they were on for a while and the

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.340 
so if they were on for a while and the
heater<00:01:10.439> they<00:01:10.799> could<00:01:10.979> possibly<00:01:11.630> then<00:01:12.630> hole

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
heater they could possibly then hole

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.020 
heater they could possibly then hole
through<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.710> cardboard<00:01:13.979> or<00:01:14.340> even<00:01:14.580> set<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:14.909> on

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
through the cardboard or even set it on

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.130 
through the cardboard or even set it on
fire<00:01:15.240> so<00:01:16.229> I'd<00:01:16.619> use<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.369> for<00:01:18.150> let's<00:01:18.299> say<00:01:18.390> 20

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
fire so I'd use it for let's say 20

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.810 
fire so I'd use it for let's say 20
minutes<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.650> then<00:01:19.740> turn<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.070> off<00:01:20.310> make<00:01:20.790> sure

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
minutes and then turn it off make sure

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.800 
minutes and then turn it off make sure
