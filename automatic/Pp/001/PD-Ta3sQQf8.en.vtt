in<00:00:04.980> the<00:00:05.100> entire<00:00:05.370> country<00:00:05.670> about<00:00:06.150> 75%<00:00:06.990> of<00:00:07.020> those

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
in the entire country about 75% of those

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.049 
in the entire country about 75% of those
live<00:00:07.440> in<00:00:07.529> the<00:00:07.620> big<00:00:07.770> city<00:00:08.040> and<00:00:08.130> Tokyo<00:00:08.880> has<00:00:09.030> a

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
live in the big city and Tokyo has a

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.910 
live in the big city and Tokyo has a
metropolitan<00:00:09.900> area<00:00:10.019> of<00:00:10.230> about<00:00:10.380> 30<00:00:10.679> million

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
metropolitan area of about 30 million

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.190 
metropolitan area of about 30 million
but<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:11.490> city<00:00:11.700> itself<00:00:11.820> is<00:00:12.240> just<00:00:12.389> 13<00:00:12.840> million

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
but the city itself is just 13 million

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.629 
but the city itself is just 13 million
so<00:00:13.469> if<00:00:13.559> you<00:00:13.679> do<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:13.920> math<00:00:14.070> on<00:00:14.250> that<00:00:14.460> that's

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
so if you do the math on that that's

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.180 
so if you do the math on that that's
about<00:00:14.880> 195<00:00:15.570> thousand<00:00:16.320> registered<00:00:16.440> foreigners

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
about 195 thousand registered foreigners

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.670 
about 195 thousand registered foreigners
in<00:00:17.340> Tokyo<00:00:17.760> and<00:00:17.940> then<00:00:18.150> another<00:00:18.300> 100<00:00:18.680> 95,000

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
in Tokyo and then another 100 95,000

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.290 
in Tokyo and then another 100 95,000
only<00:00:20.010> a<00:00:20.039> portion<00:00:20.340> of<00:00:20.520> those<00:00:20.670> speaking<00:00:20.970> there

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
only a portion of those speaking there

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.820 
only a portion of those speaking there
so<00:00:21.480> if<00:00:21.600> we<00:00:21.750> were<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:22.020> take<00:00:22.170> like<00:00:22.410> a<00:00:22.439> random

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
so if we were to take like a random

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.349 
so if we were to take like a random
guess<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.250> just<00:00:23.340> say<00:00:23.519> you<00:00:23.880> know<00:00:24.000> half<00:00:24.240> of

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
guess and just say you know half of

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.759 
guess and just say you know half of
those<00:00:24.480> people<00:00:24.840> speak<00:00:25.080> English<00:00:25.439> then<00:00:25.650> it's

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
those people speak English then it's

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.349 
those people speak English then it's
only<00:00:25.890> about<00:00:26.220> ninety<00:00:26.580> seven<00:00:26.880> thousand<00:00:27.240> five

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359

who speak English and then on top of

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.500 
who speak English and then on top of
that<00:01:02.309> if<00:01:02.489> you're<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.640> millennial<00:01:02.820> which<00:01:03.359> is

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
that if you're a millennial which is

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.719 
that if you're a millennial which is
like<00:01:03.660> 18<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.260> 35<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:05.040> it's<00:01:05.129> an<00:01:05.189> even<00:01:05.489> smaller

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
like 18 to 35 and it's an even smaller

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.130 
like 18 to 35 and it's an even smaller
circle<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.360> this<00:01:06.450> is<00:01:06.510> something<00:01:06.900> that<00:01:06.930> was

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
circle and this is something that was

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.570 
circle and this is something that was
fun<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.409> interesting<00:01:07.799> about<00:01:08.189> living<00:01:08.520> in

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
but it really started to kind of make me

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:16.180 
but it really started to kind of make me
realize<00:04:14.540> just<00:04:14.840> like<00:04:14.959> how<00:04:15.139> lucky<00:04:15.469> and<00:04:15.799> I<00:04:15.949> guess

realize just like how lucky and I guess

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.740 
realize just like how lucky and I guess
blessed<00:04:16.519> I<00:04:16.729> was<00:04:16.759> to<00:04:17.150> be<00:04:17.299> able<00:04:17.419> to<00:04:17.539> have<00:04:17.660> this

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
blessed I was to be able to have this

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.330 
blessed I was to be able to have this
experience<00:04:18.349> you<00:04:18.440> know<00:04:18.590> I<00:04:18.709> grew<00:04:18.949> up<00:04:18.979> in<00:04:19.190> North

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.279 
experience you know I grew up in North
Carolina<00:04:19.430> for<00:04:20.239> the<00:04:20.299> most<00:04:20.479> part<00:04:20.810> you<00:04:21.049> know<00:04:21.139> it's

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:21.289 
Carolina for the most part you know it's

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:23.140 
Carolina for the most part you know it's
a<00:04:21.320> fairly<00:04:21.680> normal<00:04:22.190> life<00:04:22.340> in<00:04:22.550> North<00:04:22.729> Carolina

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
a fairly normal life in North Carolina

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.450 
a fairly normal life in North Carolina
but<00:04:23.419> going<00:04:23.810> to<00:04:23.930> Tokyo<00:04:24.139> being<00:04:24.800> able<00:04:24.919> to<00:04:25.099> connect

but going to Tokyo being able to connect

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.100 
but going to Tokyo being able to connect
with<00:04:25.520> so<00:04:25.759> many<00:04:25.940> people<00:04:26.330> and<00:04:26.570> I<00:04:26.659> think<00:04:26.720> it<00:04:27.020> was

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
with so many people and I think it was

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.110
