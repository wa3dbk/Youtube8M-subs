really it's actually

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.940 
really it's actually
difficult<00:02:14.070> to<00:02:14.220> defend<00:02:14.550> if<00:02:15.240> you<00:02:16.200> kick<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.770> ball

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.390 
more games left and I think this is the
first<00:04:34.050> conversion<00:04:34.830> I<00:04:34.920> showed<00:04:35.160> or<00:04:35.580> maybe<00:04:36.240> I<00:04:36.360> saw

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
first conversion I showed or maybe I saw

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.340 
first conversion I showed or maybe I saw
but<00:04:38.400> Cooper<00:04:38.790> there<00:04:38.940> he's<00:04:39.210> decent<00:04:39.690> kicker<00:04:40.020> and

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
but Cooper there he's decent kicker and

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:41.990 
but Cooper there he's decent kicker and
I<00:04:40.500> was<00:04:40.620> actually<00:04:40.770> surprised<00:04:41.340> with<00:04:41.610> how<00:04:41.730> money

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
I was actually surprised with how money

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.320 
I was actually surprised with how money
kicks<00:04:42.390> the<00:04:42.690> opposition<00:04:43.410> miss<00:04:43.620> in<00:04:44.220> terms<00:04:45.120> of

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
kicks the opposition miss in terms of

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.150 
kicks the opposition miss in terms of
stats<00:04:45.600> because<00:04:45.840> if<00:04:46.290> you<00:04:46.380> look<00:04:46.560> at<00:04:46.710> the<00:04:46.800> kicking

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
stats because if you look at the kicking

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.890 
stats because if you look at the kicking
start<00:04:47.720> most<00:04:49.160> teams<00:04:50.160> they<00:04:51.030> miss<00:04:51.300> over<00:04:51.660> half

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
start most teams they miss over half

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.170 
start most teams they miss over half
them<00:04:52.170> yeah<00:04:53.130> when<00:04:53.340> I'm<00:04:53.460> playing<00:04:53.670> against<00:04:54.060> them

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
them yeah when I'm playing against them

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.280 
them yeah when I'm playing against them
they<00:04:54.390> tend<00:04:55.050> to<00:04:55.200> miss<00:04:55.380> none<00:04:56.420> so<00:04:57.420> Cooper<00:04:58.080> error

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290 
they tend to miss none so Cooper error

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:00.560 
they tend to miss none so Cooper error
is<00:04:58.530> the<00:04:58.680> first<00:04:58.920> option<00:04:59.250> but<00:04:59.400> we<00:04:59.520> trot<00:04:59.910> out<00:04:59.940> more

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
is the first option but we trot out more

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:05.660 
is the first option but we trot out more
white<00:05:00.810> waiter<00:05:01.800> and<00:05:03.080> tackled<00:05:04.080> again<00:05:04.460> so<00:05:05.460> it's

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:05.670 
white waiter and tackled again so it's

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:07.700 
white waiter and tackled again so it's
kind<00:05:05.880> of<00:05:05.940> like<00:05:06.060> my<00:05:06.240> Benji<00:05:06.630> Marshall<00:05:07.050> series<00:05:07.410> if

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
kind of like my Benji Marshall series if

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.120 
kind of like my Benji Marshall series if
