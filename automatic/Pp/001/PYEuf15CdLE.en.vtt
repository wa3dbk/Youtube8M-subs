00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.080
 when 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:15.000
 benoÃ®t lyon we are in society 1 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.700
 three partners who would do nothing bitter 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.119
 in the field and exploitation 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.980
 agricultural 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.989
 another structure for the business of 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:27.689
 straw in the yonne region tap 

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:30.980
 bordering with agnel on the ground 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.180
 did the spreading basically 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.950
 stone crushing tp 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.720
 and then came since and hardworking 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.540
 tights always there so a 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:43.200
 dengreville spreader of one cubic meter in 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:47.690
 two and on dpee with equipped with screens 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.690
 dick smith is the excuse of outlines 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:56.790
 it's true that once plugged in 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:58.560
 first try was so there before I 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.690
 did not have the handle for 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:04.229
 use 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.970
 so it was a tool that I like and that 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.880
 I wanted to try too because it's 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.140
 more convenient to have a handle and 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.770
 all the orders that towards the east on 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.049
 the kick on the way to the cabin we have 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.200
 unplugged the beam was changed 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.810
 to be able to feed with the connection 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.719
 of the tractor the rear stern for 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.710
 retransmit the information on 

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:33.840
 the screen its share the loading time 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:36.539
 of the program and after each every 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.389
 Once that is hangs up the material the 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:41.819
 tractor recognizes right away 

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:43.709
 there is no need to recharge but 

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:46.139
 after on the screen it is either in keys 

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:47.460
 tactile or otherwise while in command 

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:51.400
 on the handle 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.490
 on the multi-function handle 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:58.600
 opening the door 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:02.530
 stopping of the carpet modulation of 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:06.250
 carpet jams openings closures 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:11.740
 of doors and you fall order from 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:13.209
 panthers concert viewing with 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.290
 the isobus solution has more 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.520
 information on the screen we have a screen 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.350
 one less box on the side of the 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.380
 cabin but also that also improves 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.209
 visibility and then we have more 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:30.550
 information both on the screen 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:32.610
 almost 4500 tonnes per thousand 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:39.959
 four hundred and fifty hectares of meadows 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:43.090
 and its biggest in presentation choice 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:46.270
 of the epr knicks u17 went through 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:49.480
 to the regularity of spreading due 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:52.239
 leakage contours we have a sensor on 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.940
 the door on the side of the door that is 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:03:00.250
 connected go with a speed sensor of 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:02.920
 carpet then the flow offered measure that the 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:06.970
 merchandise height drop in the 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.260
 on the carpet the carpet will accelerate and 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.209
 our door will bend at the same time 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.209
 to always maintain a good 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.650
 regularity of falls on the plateaus and 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.870
 also wants to always have the same 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.150
 amount 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.340
 the first hung we liked in this 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.770
 system is to have a better everything 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:27.940
 the time until the end of panzers a 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:29.890
 regularity on the regularity of falls 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.790
 on the trays with any 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:36.510
 produced until the end we did not have 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.510
 hole under the door 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.340
 very early before starting the 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.350
 worksite have already fake must be well the 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.819
 good density 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.650
 so we know our volume of 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:52.030
 loading 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:55.620
 we enter the volume and they calculate 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.620
 ottoman in site is automatically 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.090
 after there is the coefficient of 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:03.360
 slips that adjusted what he wants 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:06.120
 change the dose more or less 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.220
 often the product and the tonnage 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:14.060
 hectares and a prayer with the width 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:14.060
 spreading and then after it rolls
