00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.360
 good as good mammals that are 

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.050
 p breeding this one right now 

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:07.090
 here are your mother's breasts 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:12.139
 he looks for them and the example takes as a backpack but in the central part of 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:16.340
 your belly only when you climb in the trees is going to the back 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.929
 of the body and clings tightly with his dreams to his mother's hair 

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:26.219
 It is a privilege to be able to see and observe a baby 

00:00:26.219 --> 00:00:30.499
 lazy for a researcher in the jungle nor lazy I see them with their 

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:35.270
 baby is really hard to observe she will buy the females with young 

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:39.070
 in the final part there is a lack of a tree where practically we do not see anything without 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.160
 a lot of hair that looks like vegetation the predators like 

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:45.309
 aguilar tiago jaguars are waiting for any distraction 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.460
 attack these animals so they must defend themselves and it is so difficult we can see 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.440
 as we can see them now 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.900
 well these animals are usually in the treetops 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.070
 especially it is difficult to see them on the ground because on the ground 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.610
 Tc carpo are usually going to change trees right now 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.360
 the mother brings her young 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.600
 to the bottom of 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.570
 of what the forest would be 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.920
 to be able to move something else and teach her how her movements will be 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.920
 a future 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.970
 precious 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.250
 is everything is like a real wonder we have been very lucky because here 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.140
 born not only a lazy baby and not 2 lazy bbc which is something 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.920
 quite weird something very special and we still do not even know if we can 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.590
 be one of the few in the world that we can witness 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.789
 an event so two inmates have been born has taken the situation a long time 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.740
 goal a smaller one do I know what the mopvi we are going to abstain that 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.119
 want hand and another that we have left with his mother that is much bigger because 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.700
 for the mother it was going to be a lot of burden because a mother the first isa quest 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.140
 internal veterinary 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.510
 a very experienced veterinarian who has been working on only five others 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.620
 veterinary clinics and the most important thing is that a woman who has a 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.720
 very developed maternal instinct and she will be the only one who will touch 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.989
 do expressed I know that you will give your food because now it will be vital 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.709
 that resigns if the milk very similar to the mother's which is going to be key in 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.919
 this process and that nobody touches it and who has always the same perception 

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:44.709
 of contact with a single mother is very important because the lazy babies 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.829
 for your maximum problem in thirteen 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:52.029
 if they get stressed their belly was much like they had to do it 

00:02:52.029 --> 00:02:52.559
 children 

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:56.129
 and he came across a disease called quintanismo and sedentary lifestyle 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:00.439
 basekit and in which to see it will continuously monitor what will give the 

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:03.870
 timely remedies that are timely on each shelf 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.650
 efe in lazy very special a lazy 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.519
 of dogs are quite tough animals with a lot of things a 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.190
 little more varied than that of 13 2 than in another variety that can also be seen 

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:17.890
 in some places, the special thing about this animal is that they are animals 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.319
 adapted to live 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:23.220
 hanging on the branch is upside down has no problem is not in the 

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:27.340
 Tehran's position because he will receive his food but normal that of 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.799
 the jobs and I had no problem I know if we had their 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:34.599
 almoradÃ­ fia the animal is able to grasp I know perfectly in a 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:38.900
 they are normal we are not about to leave home, surely nothing is very strong 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.820
 and that is the posture 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:45.690
 the norman reads from a lazy nature now we are inviting the 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.390
 her mother's belly is in fact the mother they put her belly on and she has it 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.570
 always upside down even some moments lets you climb some branch 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.870
 when it's a little bit bigger because now it's a baby it's a newborn 

00:04:03.279 --> 00:04:06.209
 it's wonderful to see what he sells 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.799
 It is one of the things that concerns us that the animal does not succeed. 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:15.309
 of eating and in fact the first days he is asleep he has not defined 

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:19.019
 natural and that we have to imitate perfectly she took the taste 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.649
 a shoe is growing with her we do not notice 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.300
 as if it were for one of our duties 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.430
 15 measures the temperature 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.290
 percent directly on the back of your hand which is where you can check if 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:36.110
 it is already at a comfortable temperature a body temperature does not need to 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.090
 be very hot 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.990
 the kun because in fact we could 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.690
 burn animal but spend more than temperature what you need is that this 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.080
 at the temperature of aqua coral 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.659
 and now as a source of 

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:51.789
 and good lazy that what you have to sleep is very important that the environment 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:54.160
 be warm i have not 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.810
 noises and also bright that percent really vital 

00:04:59.189 --> 00:05:02.240
 yes that the animal feels clothed that feels safe 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.870
 this is a special chamber in gaseous form or incubator 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.699
 that is not going to hold about 30 degrees Celsius and tied him to have in 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:14.349
 quiet your route during the next few hours
