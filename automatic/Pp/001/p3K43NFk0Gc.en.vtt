00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:52.549 
but again that comes down to a few

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:53.979 
but again that comes down to a few
things<00:00:52.760> one<00:00:53.030> thing<00:00:53.329> that<00:00:53.479> there<00:00:53.600> are<00:00:53.690> a

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
things one thing that there are a

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:55.689 
things one thing that there are a
one-car<00:00:54.379> team<00:00:54.679> and<00:00:54.889> that<00:00:55.190> makes<00:00:55.369> it<00:00:55.459> quite

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
one-car team and that makes it quite

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:59.799 
one-car team and that makes it quite
difficult<00:00:55.999> but<00:00:56.920> anything's<00:00:57.920> possible<00:00:58.100> I<00:00:58.879> not

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
difficult but anything's possible I not

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:01.029 
difficult but anything's possible I not
have<00:01:00.019> no<00:01:00.199> doubt<00:01:00.440> that<00:01:00.469> there'll<00:01:00.799> be<00:01:00.829> some

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
have no doubt that there'll be some

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:02.349 
have no doubt that there'll be some
speed<00:01:01.309> that<00:01:01.489> comes<00:01:01.670> out<00:01:01.879> of<00:01:01.909> russell<00:01:02.239> ingall

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359 
speed that comes out of russell ingall

insurers and n fit for betha so anything
anything<00:01:25.729> is<00:01:25.939> possible<00:01:26.030> but<00:01:26.539> you<00:01:26.600> know

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
anything is possible but you know

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.200 
anything is possible but you know
they're<00:01:26.990> going<00:01:27.109> to<00:01:27.170> have<00:01:27.320> some<00:01:27.500> challenges

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
they're going to have some challenges

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.999 
they're going to have some challenges
with<00:01:29.210> their<00:01:29.630> car<00:01:29.899> you<00:01:30.079> know<00:01:30.170> they<00:01:30.320> don't<00:01:30.560> have

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
with their car you know they don't have

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:34.179 
with their car you know they don't have
a<00:01:31.039> probably<00:01:32.030> the<00:01:32.390> the<00:01:32.630> resource<00:01:33.020> and<00:01:33.380> and<00:01:33.890> the

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:34.189 
a probably the the resource and and the

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:36.340 
a probably the the resource and and the
I<00:01:34.429> suppose<00:01:34.820> the<00:01:34.969> development<00:01:35.659> that<00:01:35.929> some<00:01:36.259> of

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
I suppose the development that some of

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:37.599 
I suppose the development that some of
the<00:01:36.409> other<00:01:36.560> teams<00:01:36.859> are<00:01:36.979> having<00:01:37.249> human<00:01:37.460> is<00:01:37.579> a

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:37.609 
the other teams are having human is a

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:40.810 
the other teams are having human is a
big<00:01:38.210> push<00:01:38.450> at<00:01:38.630> the<00:01:38.659> moment<00:01:39.049> and<00:01:39.859> has<00:01:40.340> been<00:01:40.549> you

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
big push at the moment and has been you

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.099 
big push at the moment and has been you
know<00:01:40.939> since<00:01:41.210> the<00:01:41.359> introduction<00:01:41.630> of<00:01:41.840> car<00:01:42.049> of

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:42.109 
know since the introduction of car of

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:43.389 
know since the introduction of car of
the<00:01:42.170> future<00:01:42.320> you<00:01:42.829> know<00:01:42.920> there's<00:01:43.039> a<00:01:43.130> lot<00:01:43.249> of

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
the future you know there's a lot of

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:45.160 
the future you know there's a lot of
development<00:01:43.880> going<00:01:43.999> on<00:01:44.240> and<00:01:44.450> I<00:01:44.689> doubt<00:01:44.990> that

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
development going on and I doubt that

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.690 
development going on and I doubt that
they<00:01:45.319> are<00:01:45.380> having<00:01:45.710> as<00:01:45.799> much<00:01:45.979> of<00:01:46.219> that<00:01:46.249> as<00:01:46.399> some

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
they are having as much of that as some

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.459 
they are having as much of that as some
of<00:01:46.759> the<00:01:46.850> big<00:01:46.999> teams<00:01:47.210> so<00:01:47.420> the<00:01:47.569> gap<00:01:47.810> is<00:01:48.049> probably

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:48.469 
of the big teams so the gap is probably

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:38.240 
races obviously it's a small outfit but

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.880 
races obviously it's a small outfit but
there's<00:03:38.480> more<00:03:38.690> variables<00:03:39.200> in<00:03:39.410> the<00:03:39.650> longer

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
there's more variables in the longer

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.010 
there's more variables in the longer
races<00:03:40.070> yeah<00:03:40.850> the<00:03:41.090> the<00:03:41.120> longer<00:03:41.630> race<00:03:41.780> has

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.020 
races yeah the the longer race has

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.350 
races yeah the the longer race has
really<00:03:42.320> helped<00:03:42.590> like<00:03:42.770> a<00:03:43.040> lot<00:03:43.640> of<00:03:43.790> infinite<00:03:44.180> a

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
really helped like a lot of infinite a

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.090 
really helped like a lot of infinite a
lot<00:03:44.630> of<00:03:44.720> emphasis<00:03:45.080> is<00:03:45.200> on<00:03:45.320> qualifying<00:03:45.860> these

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
lot of emphasis is on qualifying these

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.400 
lot of emphasis is on qualifying these
days<00:03:46.400> and<00:03:46.700> if<00:03:47.090> you<00:03:47.240> don't<00:03:47.420> qualify<00:03:47.600> well<00:03:48.110> then

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
days and if you don't qualify well then

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:49.960 
days and if you don't qualify well then
you<00:03:48.530> can't<00:03:48.770> hide<00:03:49.010> anywhere<00:03:49.400> it's<00:03:49.580> very<00:03:49.760> hard

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
you can't hide anywhere it's very hard

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.880 
you can't hide anywhere it's very hard
to<00:03:50.030> make<00:03:50.090> out<00:03:50.390> the<00:03:50.540> time<00:03:50.750> but<00:03:50.990> with<00:03:51.470> the<00:03:51.590> longer

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
to make out the time but with the longer

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.940 
to make out the time but with the longer
races<00:03:52.100> it<00:03:52.400> really<00:03:52.700> suits<00:03:52.940> Russell<00:03:53.480> a<00:03:54.320> lot<00:03:54.800> more
