00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:07.200
 let's talk about the crossbow and line 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.910
 it lasts so we started with this first 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.110
 picture of the crossbow here you see all the 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.940
 world the way it looks to me 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.410
 the truth I love has there until a 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.730
 level in green and good we go with the 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.380
 First click and attention how fast 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.880
 recharge because you throw that back 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.939
 the bullet back and that's it and this 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.500
 what is the attention because we approach 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.269
 the image here and effectively the white 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.000
 it's one we had two bullets but this one 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.890
 game more art of six what's up that with 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.370
 three bullets the moment we shoot 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.540
 Look, look how it goes down to two out of three 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.100
 until we finish the three is not going to 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.850
 stop recharging like this when we have 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.129
 zero of three then it will recharge with 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.010
 a cartridge later we will see it but 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.390
 well we are going with the following click because 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.559
 the view this game we will be able to 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.899
 put a lot of things like 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.190
 dual band example that is this 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.660
 we are going to put thermal sight 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.520
 effectively here we see how quickly 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.020
 points and everything here the one that they love is and 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.719
 effectively in this game we're going to 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.399
 we are going to put we are going to be able to put 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:03.930
 thermal gaze we are going to be able to put a 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.270
 lots of accessories 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.490
 and attention because the following eclipse 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.440
 I was blown away we're going to put clover 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.610
 so you throw three arrows with one shot 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:16.920
 bone look at the three bullets of the charger 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:21.420
 a shot is going to be very powerful the 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.820
 crossbow here we see it look bomb the 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.740
 three hit strips and you see how it is 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.060
 the charger that I told you before when 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.420
 they took out the three bullets this is how 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.040
 recharge and well here you see another click with 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.280
 the thermal sight let's see it on camera 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.990
 slow look at how fast Sanz points out that 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.940
 is life ends this game that 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.300
 we will also be able to do enough 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.380
 that is, with one side is and good 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.990
 let's talk about something else about this 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.160
 imply is the hard line advantage that 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.960
 this game is very special here we see 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.690
 all the gusts that are going to have the 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.550
 white 2 and now we see the red numbers 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.740
 which are the casualties that we are going to need 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.090
 no hard mine and yellow numbers 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.090
 the losses that we will need with 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.990
 hard line we see that the rc x take without 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.729
 hard line 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.289
 we are going to need four casualties with line 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.970
 lasts a decrease less than normal 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:08.100
 but for example the place though 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.420
 we bring hard line will continue to cost 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.130
 four casualties 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.260
 and in another streak for example dogs 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.330
 which is the last without girl of a are 13 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.819
 but is that with hard line are two casualties 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.800
 less so this game for the 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.140
 advantage to hard line to operate very 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.989
 different depending on the streak in the 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.400
 rc x of a streak in a low minus in 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.220
 some streaks will not do any 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.489
 effect on the streak as they are 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.760
 last and we will need two casualties 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.959
 less the kids to a lot of information 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.220
 tim burton's channel is removed here 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.099
 down to the right the vision to the back 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.239
 if you want more information like this I 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:44.489
 bring it enchanted only you have to 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.410
 tell me to vote it I like favorites 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:50.930
 I think you liked the video a lot and 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.930
 see you in the next goodbye
