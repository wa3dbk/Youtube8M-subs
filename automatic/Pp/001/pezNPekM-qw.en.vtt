and whoever fixed discord didn't bring
it<00:03:54.209> around<00:03:54.270> enough<00:03:54.660> for<00:03:54.840> the<00:03:54.900> clock<00:03:55.080> spring<00:03:55.319> to

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
it around enough for the clock spring to

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.500 
it around enough for the clock spring to
work<00:03:55.709> look<00:03:56.370> how<00:03:56.490> short<00:03:56.670> this<00:03:56.880> thing<00:03:57.060> is<00:03:57.180> okay

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
work look how short this thing is okay

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.670 
work look how short this thing is okay
just<00:03:57.540> hold<00:03:57.750> for<00:03:57.870> one<00:03:58.050> second<00:04:00.050> so<00:04:01.050> that's<00:04:01.470> the

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
just hold for one second so that's the

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.190 
just hold for one second so that's the
hole<00:04:01.830> for<00:04:02.819> some<00:04:03.000> reason<00:04:03.360> that<00:04:03.450> looks<00:04:03.660> long<00:04:03.900> but

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
hole for some reason that looks long but

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
couple more times okay only a couple

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.270 
couple more times okay only a couple
more<00:04:21.000> just<00:04:21.269> let<00:04:21.419> it<00:04:21.540> go<00:04:21.630> back<00:04:21.840> slowly<00:04:22.650> slowly<00:04:22.980> I

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
more just let it go back slowly slowly I

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.720 
more just let it go back slowly slowly I
came<00:04:23.700> home<00:04:24.020> because<00:04:25.020> it's<00:04:25.230> still<00:04:25.590> out<00:04:25.740> like

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
came home because it's still out like

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:31.880 
came home because it's still out like
ten<00:04:26.970> inches<00:04:27.320> so<00:04:30.080> it<00:04:31.080> needs<00:04:31.320> a<00:04:31.440> quarter<00:04:31.770> of<00:04:31.830> a

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890 
ten inches so it needs a quarter of a

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:33.860 
ten inches so it needs a quarter of a
turn<00:04:32.070> to<00:04:32.310> go<00:04:32.460> so<00:04:32.669> one<00:04:32.880> more<00:04:33.120> full<00:04:33.390> turn<00:04:33.600> might

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
turn to go so one more full turn might

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.990 
turn to go so one more full turn might
bring<00:04:34.050> it<00:04:34.200> back<00:04:34.430> we<00:04:35.430> can't<00:04:35.640> bring<00:04:35.820> it<00:04:35.880> around
