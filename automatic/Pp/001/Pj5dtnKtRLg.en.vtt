away what happened there you know I

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.850

think<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.900> game<00:01:07.049> sometimes<00:01:07.290> just<00:01:07.619> gets<00:01:07.770> the

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
think the game sometimes just gets the

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.080 
think the game sometimes just gets the
best<00:01:08.010> of<00:01:08.189> us<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:08.580> brings<00:01:08.700> out<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:08.939> best

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
best of us and it brings out the best

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.450 
best of us and it brings out the best
competition<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:09.960> sometimes<00:01:10.799> you<00:01:10.920> boil<00:01:11.220> over

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
competition and sometimes you boil over

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.679 
competition and sometimes you boil over
a<00:01:11.520> little<00:01:11.729> bit<00:01:11.850> I'm<00:01:12.000> sure<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.299> see<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:12.540> in<00:01:12.630> the
