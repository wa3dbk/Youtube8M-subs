00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.910 
what I'm doing there's a neat trick with
this<00:02:07.700> hand<00:02:07.940> sort<00:02:08.390> of<00:02:08.539> glitch<00:02:08.810> where<00:02:09.380> if<00:02:09.679> you

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
this hand sort of glitch where if you

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.559 
this hand sort of glitch where if you
drag<00:02:10.280> your<00:02:10.459> airplane<00:02:10.880> to<00:02:11.000> the<00:02:11.090> far<00:02:11.270> left<00:02:11.510> side

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
drag your airplane to the far left side

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.380 
drag your airplane to the far left side
take<00:02:12.260> your<00:02:12.500> mouse<00:02:12.680> entirely<00:02:13.310> outside<00:02:13.670> of<00:02:14.300> the

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
take your mouse entirely outside of the

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.059 
take your mouse entirely outside of the
playing<00:02:14.690> field<00:02:15.140> swing<00:02:15.560> it<00:02:15.650> around<00:02:15.740> to<00:02:16.040> the

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
playing field swing it around to the

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.550 
playing field swing it around to the
other<00:02:16.160> side<00:02:16.819> to<00:02:17.120> the<00:02:17.209> right<00:02:17.420> side<00:02:17.450> and<00:02:18.020> then

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
other side to the right side and then

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.760 
other side to the right side and then
bring<00:02:18.739> the<00:02:18.890> mouse<00:02:19.040> in<00:02:19.480> your<00:02:20.480> plane<00:02:21.290> will

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
bring the mouse in your plane will

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.880 
bring the mouse in your plane will
launch<00:02:22.280> at<00:02:22.790> crazy<00:02:23.330> high<00:02:23.630> speeds<00:02:24.050> in<00:02:24.380> the

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
launch at crazy high speeds in the

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.830 
launch at crazy high speeds in the
general<00:02:25.340> direction<00:02:25.370> of<00:02:25.880> where<00:02:26.510> your<00:02:26.660> mouse<00:02:26.810> is

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
general direction of where your mouse is

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.240 
general direction of where your mouse is
pointing<00:02:27.290> on<00:02:27.380> the<00:02:27.470> other<00:02:27.590> side<00:02:27.800> as<00:02:28.010> though<00:02:28.190> you

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
pointing on the other side as though you

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.979 
pointing on the other side as though you
threw<00:02:28.520> it<00:02:28.640> as<00:02:28.760> fast<00:02:29.120> as<00:02:29.270> you<00:02:29.360> possibly<00:02:29.390> could

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
threw it as fast as you possibly could

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:30.400 
threw it as fast as you possibly could
ah

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
ah

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.320 
ah
and<00:02:30.709> that'll<00:02:31.250> usually<00:02:31.670> get<00:02:31.819> you<00:02:31.940> some<00:02:32.120> really

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
and that'll usually get you some really

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.449 
and that'll usually get you some really
good<00:02:32.540> distance<00:02:32.900> here<00:02:33.110> and<00:02:33.260> this<00:02:33.470> well<00:02:34.220> there

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
good distance here and this well there

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.040 
good distance here and this well there
was<00:02:34.580> a<00:02:34.610> little<00:02:34.730> too<00:02:34.940> much<00:02:35.090> up<00:02:35.300> and<00:02:35.660> not<00:02:35.810> quite

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
was a little too much up and not quite

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.400 
was a little too much up and not quite
enough<00:02:36.260> over<00:02:36.590> so<00:02:36.880> it's<00:02:37.880> it's<00:02:38.180> not<00:02:38.300> gonna<00:02:38.660> get

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
enough over so it's it's not gonna get

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.630 
enough over so it's it's not gonna get
me<00:02:39.590> too<00:02:40.519> terribly<00:02:40.850> far<00:02:40.940> here<00:02:41.330> but<00:02:41.680> if<00:02:42.680> you<00:02:42.980> are

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
me too terribly far here but if you are

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.100 
me too terribly far here but if you are
very<00:02:43.880> careful<00:02:44.090> if<00:02:44.720> you<00:02:44.810> know<00:02:44.900> what<00:02:45.019> you're

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
very careful if you know what you're

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.479 
very careful if you know what you're
doing<00:02:45.320> give<00:02:45.500> it<00:02:45.560> a<00:02:45.620> lot<00:02:45.739> of<00:02:45.800> tries<00:02:45.980> you'll

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
doing give it a lot of tries you'll

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.850 
doing give it a lot of tries you'll
eventually<00:02:46.700> get<00:02:47.060> some<00:02:47.269> really<00:02:47.630> long<00:02:48.140> distance

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
eventually get some really long distance

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.949 
eventually get some really long distance
flights<00:02:49.040> in<00:02:49.400> here<00:02:49.610> and<00:02:49.760> I<00:02:49.850> think<00:02:50.180> this<00:02:50.810> game

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
flights in here and I think this game

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:52.180 
flights in here and I think this game
keeps<00:02:51.290> going<00:02:51.380> indefinitely

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
keeps going indefinitely

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.229 
keeps going indefinitely
you<00:02:52.880> can<00:02:53.000> just<00:02:53.180> fly<00:02:53.600> forever<00:02:54.230> nice<00:02:55.190> of<00:02:56.030> course

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
you can just fly forever nice of course

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:57.880 
you can just fly forever nice of course
I<00:02:56.330> don't<00:02:56.390> get<00:02:56.600> a<00:02:56.630> global<00:02:57.019> rank<00:02:57.230> or<00:02:57.380> even<00:02:57.590> a<00:02:57.650> tip

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
I don't get a global rank or even a tip

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.610 
I don't get a global rank or even a tip
here<00:02:58.160> but<00:02:58.400> that's<00:02:59.090> because<00:02:59.540> I<00:02:59.870> don't<00:03:00.170> have<00:03:00.500> any

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
here but that's because I don't have any

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.620 
here but that's because I don't have any
cookies<00:03:01.310> right<00:03:01.489> now<00:03:01.610> because<00:03:02.030> if<00:03:02.180> I'm<00:03:02.420> not

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
cookies right now because if I'm not

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.229 
cookies right now because if I'm not
mistaken<00:03:02.989> this<00:03:03.350> game<00:03:03.620> puts<00:03:04.310> a<00:03:04.459> cookie<00:03:04.850> on<00:03:05.000> your

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
mistaken this game puts a cookie on your

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:06.910 
mistaken this game puts a cookie on your
computer<00:03:05.570> and<00:03:05.780> then<00:03:06.200> it<00:03:06.230> will<00:03:06.410> track<00:03:06.650> your

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
computer and then it will track your

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.970 
computer and then it will track your
high<00:03:07.340> scores<00:03:07.670> and<00:03:07.790> that<00:03:08.720> was<00:03:08.959> stupid

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
high scores and that was stupid

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.009 
high scores and that was stupid
it'll<00:03:10.489> track<00:03:10.670> your<00:03:10.820> high<00:03:10.940> scores<00:03:11.209> except<00:03:11.810> I've

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
it'll track your high scores except I've

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.740 
it'll track your high scores except I've
been<00:03:12.620> feeling<00:03:13.100> sick<00:03:13.640> recently<00:03:14.150> and<00:03:14.299> so<00:03:14.540> I

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
been feeling sick recently and so I

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.470 
been feeling sick recently and so I
tossed<00:03:15.350> my<00:03:15.470> cookies<00:03:15.860> and<00:03:16.160> now<00:03:17.120> I<00:03:17.150> don't<00:03:17.299> have

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
tossed my cookies and now I don't have

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.330 
tossed my cookies and now I don't have
any<00:03:17.660> high<00:03:17.780> scores<00:03:18.019> recorded<00:03:18.410> but<00:03:18.739> I<00:03:19.010> think

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
any high scores recorded but I think

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.009 
any high scores recorded but I think
we're<00:03:19.459> making<00:03:19.700> history<00:03:19.820> here<00:03:20.060> with<00:03:20.780> a<00:03:20.810> high
