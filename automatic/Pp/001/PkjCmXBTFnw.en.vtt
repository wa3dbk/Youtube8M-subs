00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
the scientific name of southern Live Oak

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.480 
the scientific name of southern Live Oak
is<00:00:05.490> Quercus<00:00:06.029> virginiana<00:00:06.770> the<00:00:07.770> name<00:00:07.980> Live<00:00:08.250> Oak

is Quercus virginiana the name Live Oak

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.490 
is Quercus virginiana the name Live Oak
comes<00:00:08.910> from<00:00:09.120> the<00:00:09.210> fact<00:00:09.450> that<00:00:09.690> the<00:00:09.929> oak<00:00:10.080> remains

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
comes from the fact that the oak remains

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.020
