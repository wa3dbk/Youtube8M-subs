operational overview of the DCT for one

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.260 
operational overview of the DCT for one
for<00:01:21.800> s1<00:01:22.899> infrared<00:01:23.899> thermometer<00:01:25.119> basically<00:01:26.119> to

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
for s1 infrared thermometer basically to

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.630 
for s1 infrared thermometer basically to
activate<00:01:26.720> the<00:01:26.899> unit<00:01:27.259> you<00:01:28.009> just<00:01:28.220> squeeze<00:01:28.459> the

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
activate the unit you just squeeze the

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.300 
activate the unit you just squeeze the
trigger<00:01:28.670> and<00:01:29.179> as<00:01:29.990> you<00:01:30.140> can<00:01:30.229> see<00:01:30.500> the<00:01:30.649> LCD<00:01:30.800> goes

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
trigger and as you can see the LCD goes

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.230 
trigger and as you can see the LCD goes
into<00:01:31.580> a<00:01:31.610> diagnostic<00:01:32.390> mode<00:01:33.610> so<00:01:34.610> basically

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
into a diagnostic mode so basically

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.699 
into a diagnostic mode so basically
we'll<00:01:35.450> start<00:01:35.690> at<00:01:35.780> the<00:01:35.899> upper<00:01:36.110> left<00:01:36.319> here<00:01:36.530> the

00:01:36.699 --> 00:01:36.709 
we'll start at the upper left here the

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:39.580 
we'll start at the upper left here the
upper<00:01:36.979> left<00:01:37.190> hold<00:01:37.640> icon<00:01:38.149> is<00:01:38.450> whenever<00:01:39.410> the

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
upper left hold icon is whenever the

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.169 
upper left hold icon is whenever the
trigger<00:01:39.830> is<00:01:39.979> released<00:01:40.009> it<00:01:40.580> goes<00:01:40.729> in<00:01:40.880> the<00:01:40.970> hold

00:01:41.169 --> 00:01:41.179 
trigger is released it goes in the hold

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:44.740 
trigger is released it goes in the hold
mode<00:01:41.450> so<00:01:42.380> we<00:01:43.160> hit<00:01:43.429> hold<00:01:43.910> the<00:01:44.060> trigger<00:01:44.270> it<00:01:44.599> goes

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
mode so we hit hold the trigger it goes

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.020 
mode so we hit hold the trigger it goes
to<00:01:44.959> scan<00:01:45.289> release<00:01:45.950> goes<00:01:46.220> to<00:01:46.429> hold<00:01:46.640> it<00:01:46.910> will

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
to scan release goes to hold it will

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.389 
to scan release goes to hold it will
hold<00:01:47.240> the<00:01:47.360> last<00:01:47.630> temperature<00:01:48.170> to<00:01:49.009> the<00:01:49.190> right

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
hold the last temperature to the right

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:52.419 
hold the last temperature to the right
of<00:01:49.550> that<00:01:49.729> is<00:01:50.030> the<00:01:50.530> power<00:01:51.530> gauge<00:01:51.860> tells<00:01:52.220> you<00:01:52.340> how

00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:52.429 
of that is the power gauge tells you how

so basically we'll just click turn it

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.630 
so basically we'll just click turn it
back<00:02:13.550> on<00:02:14.200> it<00:02:15.200> also<00:02:15.380> has<00:02:15.650> an<00:02:15.770> auto<00:02:15.920> off<00:02:16.250> where<00:02:16.550> it

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
back on it also has an auto off where it

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.039 
back on it also has an auto off where it
will<00:02:16.760> go<00:02:16.910> off<00:02:17.060> if<00:02:17.239> it's<00:02:17.390> not<00:02:17.599> used<00:02:17.780> for<00:02:17.930> a

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.049 
will go off if it's not used for a

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:19.240 
will go off if it's not used for a
certain<00:02:18.290> amount<00:02:18.409> of<00:02:18.500> time<00:02:18.739> to<00:02:18.890> conserve

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
certain amount of time to conserve

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.199 
certain amount of time to conserve
battery<00:02:19.280> life

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
battery life

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.630 
battery life
so<00:02:21.019> we'll<00:02:21.170> hit<00:02:21.230> the<00:02:21.409> alarm<00:02:21.680> button<00:02:21.920> as<00:02:22.430> you<00:02:22.489> can

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
so we'll hit the alarm button as you can

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.539 
so we'll hit the alarm button as you can
see<00:02:22.909> we<00:02:23.060> run<00:02:23.120> alarm<00:02:23.540> three<00:02:24.079> alarm<00:02:24.980> three<00:02:25.280> means

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.549 
see we run alarm three alarm three means

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:28.630 
see we run alarm three alarm three means
up<00:02:26.420> at<00:02:26.629> the<00:02:26.720> top<00:02:26.930> here<00:02:27.170> has<00:02:27.349> a<00:02:27.379> red<00:02:27.709> and<00:02:27.980> a<00:02:28.400> blue

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
up at the top here has a red and a blue

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.600 
up at the top here has a red and a blue
LED<00:02:29.180> that<00:02:29.720> you<00:02:29.840> can<00:02:30.019> set<00:02:30.349> temperature<00:02:31.250> limits

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
LED that you can set temperature limits

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.020 
LED that you can set temperature limits
so<00:02:32.269> if<00:02:32.720> you<00:02:32.959> hit<00:02:33.829> something<00:02:34.040> hot<00:02:34.340> it'll<00:02:34.610> go<00:02:34.760> red

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
so if you hit something hot it'll go red

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.170 
so if you hit something hot it'll go red
if<00:02:35.269> you<00:02:35.420> hit<00:02:35.540> something<00:02:35.810> cold<00:02:36.110> it'll<00:02:36.470> go<00:02:36.650> blue

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
if you hit something cold it'll go blue

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.800 
if you hit something cold it'll go blue
basically<00:02:38.200> alarm<00:02:39.200> three<00:02:39.470> means<00:02:39.739> that<00:02:40.099> those

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
basically alarm three means that those

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.970 
basically alarm three means that those
lights<00:02:41.810> are<00:02:41.959> going<00:02:42.049> to<00:02:42.109> come<00:02:42.200> on<00:02:42.470> either<00:02:42.739> the

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
lights are going to come on either the

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.280 
lights are going to come on either the
hot<00:02:43.159> or<00:02:43.430> the<00:02:43.519> cold<00:02:43.760> and<00:02:44.060> it's<00:02:44.780> also<00:02:44.959> going<00:02:45.230> to

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
hot or the cold and it's also going to

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.970 
hot or the cold and it's also going to
beep<00:02:45.549> so<00:02:46.549> if<00:02:46.640> we<00:02:46.760> go<00:02:46.909> down<00:02:47.060> to<00:02:47.239> alarm<00:02:47.629> -<00:02:47.900> alarm<00:02:48.200> -

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
beep so if we go down to alarm - alarm -

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.429 
beep so if we go down to alarm - alarm -
means<00:02:49.250> that<00:02:49.640> the<00:02:50.060> unit<00:02:50.450> is<00:02:50.599> just<00:02:51.049> going<00:02:51.319> to

00:02:51.429 --> 00:02:51.439 
means that the unit is just going to

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:53.949 
means that the unit is just going to
beep<00:02:51.739> there<00:02:52.310> will<00:02:52.549> be<00:02:52.579> no<00:02:52.909> red<00:02:53.180> LED<00:02:53.720> or

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
beep there will be no red LED or

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.460 
beep there will be no red LED or
anything<00:02:54.200> like<00:02:54.440> that<00:02:55.599> alarm<00:02:56.599> one<00:02:56.840> it's<00:02:57.170> just

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
anything like that alarm one it's just

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.649 
anything like that alarm one it's just
the<00:02:57.650> LEDs<00:02:58.099> so<00:02:58.549> basically<00:02:58.940> no<00:02:59.329> sound

00:02:59.649 --> 00:02:59.659 
the LEDs so basically no sound

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:03.759 
the LEDs so basically no sound
whatsoever<00:03:00.970> ok<00:03:01.970> if<00:03:02.060> we<00:03:02.150> hit<00:03:02.269> alarm<00:03:02.599> again<00:03:02.930> we

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
whatsoever ok if we hit alarm again we

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.129 
whatsoever ok if we hit alarm again we
see<00:03:03.980> we<00:03:04.129> have<00:03:04.159> a<00:03:04.459> check<00:03:04.760> el<00:03:05.060> that's<00:03:05.659> the<00:03:05.989> high

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:06.139 
see we have a check el that's the high

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:09.250 
see we have a check el that's the high
alarm<00:03:06.650> limits<00:03:07.040> set<00:03:07.670> at<00:03:07.760> 128<00:03:08.420> right<00:03:08.629> now<00:03:08.810> we'll

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
alarm limits set at 128 right now we'll

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.369 
alarm limits set at 128 right now we'll
hit<00:03:09.349> the<00:03:09.530> alarm<00:03:09.799> again<00:03:10.540> and<00:03:11.540> we<00:03:11.930> got<00:03:12.079> the<00:03:12.200> lower

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:12.379 
hit the alarm again and we got the lower

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:14.619 
hit the alarm again and we got the lower
limit<00:03:12.799> so<00:03:13.099> anything<00:03:13.639> below<00:03:13.790> sixty<00:03:14.329> degrees

00:03:14.619 --> 00:03:14.629 
limit so anything below sixty degrees

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:17.020 
limit so anything below sixty degrees
will<00:03:14.930> trigger<00:03:15.290> a<00:03:15.409> blue<00:03:15.680> light<00:03:15.920> and<00:03:16.159> a<00:03:16.549> beep<00:03:16.790> if

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
will trigger a blue light and a beep if

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.530 
will trigger a blue light and a beep if
we<00:03:17.180> have<00:03:17.329> it<00:03:17.480> set<00:03:17.750> on<00:03:17.930> alarm<00:03:18.230> 3<00:03:19.090> and<00:03:20.090> again

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
we have it set on alarm 3 and again

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.020 
we have it set on alarm 3 and again
takes<00:03:20.780> you<00:03:20.870> right<00:03:21.019> back<00:03:21.230> to<00:03:21.290> the<00:03:21.439> beginning<00:03:22.030> ok

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
takes you right back to the beginning ok

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.030 
takes you right back to the beginning ok
so<00:03:23.090> right<00:03:23.359> here<00:03:23.629> we<00:03:23.810> have<00:03:23.840> the<00:03:24.079> min/max<00:03:24.319> button

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
so right here we have the min/max button

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.939 
so right here we have the min/max button
we<00:03:25.730> had<00:03:25.910> that<00:03:26.150> it<00:03:26.480> basically<00:03:26.959> averages<00:03:27.829> out

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:27.949 
we had that it basically averages out

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:29.500 
we had that it basically averages out
your<00:03:28.129> temperatures<00:03:28.609> the<00:03:28.940> max<00:03:29.150> temperature

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
your temperatures the max temperature

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.599 
your temperatures the max temperature
that<00:03:29.780> we<00:03:29.930> took<00:03:30.169> the<00:03:31.069> minimum<00:03:31.400> temperature

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:31.609 
that we took the minimum temperature

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:34.539 
that we took the minimum temperature
that<00:03:31.970> we<00:03:32.120> took<00:03:32.329> and<00:03:32.709> the<00:03:33.709> average<00:03:34.069> temperature

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
that we took and the average temperature

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:36.550 
that we took and the average temperature
that<00:03:34.849> we<00:03:35.030> took<00:03:35.209> so<00:03:36.019> pretty<00:03:36.230> self-explanatory

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
that we took so pretty self-explanatory

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.759 
that we took so pretty self-explanatory
on<00:03:37.400> that<00:03:37.669> I'm<00:03:37.879> going<00:03:38.840> to<00:03:38.959> the<00:03:39.079> upper<00:03:39.379> right<00:03:39.560> now

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
on that I'm going to the upper right now

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:41.379 
on that I'm going to the upper right now
Celsius<00:03:40.730> and<00:03:40.909> Fahrenheit

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:41.389 
Celsius and Fahrenheit

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:43.089 
Celsius and Fahrenheit
this<00:03:41.780> will<00:03:41.959> allow<00:03:42.169> you<00:03:42.230> to<00:03:42.379> obviously<00:03:42.769> change

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:43.099 
this will allow you to obviously change

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:47.140 
this will allow you to obviously change
your<00:03:43.250> units<00:03:43.579> of<00:03:43.730> measure<00:03:43.940> and<00:03:45.790> below<00:03:46.790> that<00:03:47.030> we

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
your units of measure and below that we

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.050 
your units of measure and below that we
have<00:03:47.180> the<00:03:47.299> EMS<00:03:47.810> button<00:03:48.199> EMS<00:03:48.799> is<00:03:49.010> basically<00:03:49.459> the

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
have the EMS button EMS is basically the

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.990 
have the EMS button EMS is basically the
ability<00:03:50.629> of<00:03:51.440> a<00:03:51.590> surface<00:03:51.859> to<00:03:52.250> radiate<00:03:52.729> heat

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
ability of a surface to radiate heat

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.119 
ability of a surface to radiate heat
also<00:03:53.720> says<00:03:54.169> radiate<00:03:54.560> heat<00:03:54.709> differently

00:03:55.119 --> 00:03:55.129 
also says radiate heat differently

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:59.619 
also says radiate heat differently
whether<00:03:55.340> it<00:03:55.489> be<00:03:55.609> water<00:03:56.349> aluminum<00:03:57.349> wood<00:03:57.979> so<00:03:58.849> you

00:03:59.619 --> 00:03:59.629 
whether it be water aluminum wood so you

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:01.000 
whether it be water aluminum wood so you
can<00:03:59.780> actually<00:03:59.959> adjust<00:04:00.199> that<00:04:00.620> here<00:04:00.799> through

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
can actually adjust that here through

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.219 
can actually adjust that here through
the<00:04:01.099> EMS<00:04:01.519> setting<00:04:01.970> now<00:04:02.329> they<00:04:02.479> did<00:04:02.810> include<00:04:03.049> a

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:03.229 
the EMS setting now they did include a

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:07.270 
the EMS setting now they did include a
guide<00:04:03.549> which<00:04:04.549> tells<00:04:04.849> you<00:04:05.060> what<00:04:05.530> EMS<00:04:06.560> should<00:04:07.099> be

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
guide which tells you what EMS should be

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.460 
guide which tells you what EMS should be
set<00:04:07.549> for<00:04:07.849> whatever<00:04:08.299> kind<00:04:08.840> of<00:04:08.959> surface<00:04:09.290> you're

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
set for whatever kind of surface you're

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.680 
set for whatever kind of surface you're
working<00:04:09.500> on<00:04:09.889> so<00:04:10.639> overall<00:04:11.060> we<00:04:11.269> really<00:04:11.540> like

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
working on so overall we really like

as we get closer and closer so that

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.040 
as we get closer and closer so that
