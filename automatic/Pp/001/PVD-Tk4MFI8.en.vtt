I'm going to talk to you about

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.900 
I'm going to talk to you about
polyrhythms<00:00:12.080> so<00:00:13.080> what<00:00:13.650> is<00:00:13.830> a<00:00:14.040> polyrhythm<00:00:14.610> the

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
polyrhythms so what is a polyrhythm the

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.750 
polyrhythms so what is a polyrhythm the
polyrhythm<00:00:15.509> is<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.170> simultaneous

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:16.760 
polyrhythm is the simultaneous

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.730 
polyrhythm is the simultaneous
performance<00:00:17.760> of<00:00:18.000> two<00:00:18.449> or<00:00:18.630> more<00:00:18.740> contrasting

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
performance of two or more contrasting

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.300 
performance of two or more contrasting
rhythms<00:00:20.100> so<00:00:20.760> I'm<00:00:20.910> gonna<00:00:21.029> demonstrate<00:00:21.359> today

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.310 
rhythms so I'm gonna demonstrate today

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.730 
rhythms so I'm gonna demonstrate today

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
have handy alright but I'm just napping

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.930 
have handy alright but I'm just napping
here<00:00:42.750> for<00:00:42.930> now<00:00:43.050> so<00:00:43.829> this<00:00:44.010> first<00:00:44.250> one<00:00:44.460> is<00:00:44.850> called

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
here for now so this first one is called

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.950 
here for now so this first one is called
the<00:00:45.180> 2:3<00:00:45.809> polyrhythm<00:00:45.989> two<00:00:46.590> against<00:00:47.010> three<00:00:47.070> and

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
the 2:3 polyrhythm two against three and

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.069 
the 2:3 polyrhythm two against three and
so<00:00:48.960> for<00:00:49.170> every<00:00:49.320> two<00:00:49.829> snaps<00:00:50.219> here<00:00:50.780> so<00:00:51.780> think<00:00:52.020> of

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
so for every two snaps here so think of

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.010 
so for every two snaps here so think of
this<00:00:52.199> one<00:00:52.559> two<00:00:53.160> one<00:00:53.850> two<00:00:54.180> there's<00:00:54.750> gonna<00:00:54.840> be

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
this one two one two there's gonna be

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.709 
this one two one two there's gonna be
three<00:00:55.260> snaps<00:00:55.680> with<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.129> other<00:00:56.250> hand<00:00:59.420> one<00:01:00.420> two

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
three snaps with the other hand one two

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.959 
three snaps with the other hand one two
three<00:01:01.079> one<00:01:01.379> two<00:01:01.410> three<00:01:01.680> one<00:01:02.309> two<00:01:02.340> three<00:01:02.609> one

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
three one two three one two three one

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.429 
three one two three one two three one
two<00:01:03.390> three<00:01:05.299> can<00:01:06.299> you<00:01:06.390> hear<00:01:06.540> that<00:01:06.570> contrast<00:01:07.260> a

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
two three can you hear that contrast a

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:08.960 
two three can you hear that contrast a
little<00:01:07.680> bit<00:01:07.830> that's<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.189> very<00:01:08.400> simple<00:01:08.760> follow

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
little bit that's a very simple follow

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.969 
little bit that's a very simple follow
within<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.390> 2:3<00:01:09.810> polyrhythm<00:01:09.960> this<00:01:10.500> next<00:01:10.860> one

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
within the 2:3 polyrhythm this next one

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.240 
within the 2:3 polyrhythm this next one
I'm<00:01:11.070> gonna<00:01:11.159> show<00:01:11.430> you<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:12.260> a<00:01:13.260> three-four

I'm gonna show you is a three-four

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.560 
I'm gonna show you is a three-four
polyrhythm<00:01:14.790> so<00:01:15.659> there's<00:01:16.229> three<00:01:16.470> snaps<00:01:17.570> one

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
polyrhythm so there's three snaps one

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.770 
polyrhythm so there's three snaps one
two<00:01:19.020> three<00:01:19.530> one<00:01:20.009> two<00:01:20.310> three<00:01:20.490> four<00:01:21.240> every<00:01:21.479> three

two three one two three four every three

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.539 
two three one two three four every three
there's<00:01:22.049> gonna<00:01:22.140> be<00:01:22.320> four<00:01:22.680> in<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.100> other<00:01:23.250> hand

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
ok let's go back to that 2:3 polyrhythm

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.270 
ok let's go back to that 2:3 polyrhythm
so<00:01:56.399> get<00:01:56.640> your<00:01:56.759> hands<00:01:56.939> ready<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:58.100> before<00:01:59.100> I<00:01:59.130> do

more difficult so I'm not gonna say not
difficult<00:03:07.050> on<00:03:07.230> the<00:03:07.620> three<00:03:07.860> four<00:03:08.360> I'm<00:03:09.360> gonna

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
difficult on the three four I'm gonna

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.870 
difficult on the three four I'm gonna
say<00:03:10.020> I'm<00:03:10.890> a<00:03:10.950> polyrhythm

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
say I'm a polyrhythm

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.960 
say I'm a polyrhythm
right<00:03:12.420> and<00:03:12.870> I'm<00:03:13.200> gonna<00:03:13.290> emphasize<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:14.250> imma

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
right and I'm gonna emphasize the imma

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.250 
right and I'm gonna emphasize the imma
polyrhythm<00:03:15.450> cuz<00:03:15.630> that's<00:03:15.810> where<00:03:16.050> you're<00:03:16.170> gonna

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
polyrhythm cuz that's where you're gonna

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.890 
polyrhythm cuz that's where you're gonna
snap<00:03:16.530> together<00:03:16.890> on<00:03:17.190> the<00:03:17.310> iron<00:03:17.550> all<00:03:18.450> right<00:03:18.660> so

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
snap together on the iron all right so

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.770 
snap together on the iron all right so
it's<00:03:19.020> gonna<00:03:19.080> be<00:03:19.320> like<00:03:19.470> this<00:03:20.270> I'm<00:03:21.270> a<00:03:22.760> polyrhythm

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
it's gonna be like this I'm a polyrhythm

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.700 
it's gonna be like this I'm a polyrhythm
I'm<00:03:24.780> a<00:03:25.290> poly<00:03:26.180> rhythm<00:03:27.180> so<00:03:27.780> I'm<00:03:28.020> going<00:03:28.470> on

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:28.710 
I'm a poly rhythm so I'm going on

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.550 
I'm a poly rhythm so I'm going on
together<00:03:29.100> right<00:03:29.790> left<00:03:30.510> right<00:03:30.780> left<00:03:30.990> right

time<00:03:35.450> poly<00:03:36.590> rhythm<00:03:37.590> and<00:03:37.710> you<00:03:37.770> can<00:03:37.890> go<00:03:38.040> slower

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:38.460 
time poly rhythm and you can go slower

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.160 
time poly rhythm and you can go slower
if<00:03:39.120> you're<00:03:39.330> having<00:03:39.450> trouble<00:03:39.810> getting<00:03:39.900> that

one two three four just like that so
those<00:04:11.970> are<00:04:12.210> 2<00:04:12.390> polyrhythm<00:04:12.870> x'<00:04:13.170> and<00:04:14.720> those<00:04:15.720> are

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
those are 2 polyrhythm x' and those are

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.740 
those are 2 polyrhythm x' and those are
pretty<00:04:16.560> much<00:04:16.650> the<00:04:16.799> two<00:04:16.950> most<00:04:17.280> basic<00:04:17.750> poly

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
pretty much the two most basic poly

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.539 
pretty much the two most basic poly
brothers<00:04:19.140> there's<00:04:19.320> so<00:04:19.739> many<00:04:20.010> of<00:04:20.250> them<00:04:20.430> though

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
brothers there's so many of them though

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.409 
brothers there's so many of them though
it's<00:04:20.940> infinite<00:04:21.479> and<00:04:22.040> in<00:04:23.040> future<00:04:23.430> videos<00:04:23.610> I'm
