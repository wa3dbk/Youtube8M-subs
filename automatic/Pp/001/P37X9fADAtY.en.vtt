00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
think just this video the audio will be

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.939 
think just this video the audio will be
okay<00:00:26.039> so<00:00:26.099> it<00:00:26.760> was<00:00:26.910> about<00:00:27.029> CM<00:00:27.720> Punk<00:00:28.050> returning

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
okay so it was about CM Punk returning

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.700 
okay so it was about CM Punk returning
possibly<00:00:29.580> enjoining<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.359> shield<00:00:30.660> now<00:00:31.590> I'm

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
possibly enjoining the shield now I'm

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.010 
possibly enjoining the shield now I'm
not<00:00:31.859> saying<00:00:32.130> he<00:00:32.279> is<00:00:32.309> because<00:00:33.059> surely<00:00:33.270> he<00:00:33.600> isn't

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
not saying he is because surely he isn't

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.440 
not saying he is because surely he isn't
but<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:34.739> know<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.190> would<00:00:35.309> be<00:00:35.430> cool<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:36.000> see<00:00:36.180> it

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
but you know it would be cool to see it

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.049 
but you know it would be cool to see it
because<00:00:36.870> what<00:00:37.200> they<00:00:37.350> could<00:00:37.500> have<00:00:37.620> done<00:00:38.059> was

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
because what they could have done was

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.799 
because what they could have done was
with<00:00:39.420> evolution<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.200> dunk<00:00:41.160> it<00:00:41.370> they<00:00:41.809> petit

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
with evolution and dunk it they petit

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.479 
with evolution and dunk it they petit
would<00:00:43.020> leave<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.469> Punk<00:00:43.680> would<00:00:43.770> fill<00:00:44.190> in<00:00:44.340> that

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
would leave and Punk would fill in that

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.000 
would leave and Punk would fill in that
road<00:00:44.670> we<00:00:44.969> have<00:00:45.180> these<00:00:45.329> we<00:00:46.200> can<00:00:46.350> have<00:00:46.500> more<00:00:46.739> 6

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
road we have these we can have more 6

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.250 
road we have these we can have more 6
min<00:00:47.219> matches<00:00:48.090> except<00:00:48.510> for<00:00:48.660> CM<00:00:48.870> Punk<00:00:48.899> will<00:00:49.170> be

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
min matches except for CM Punk will be

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.029 
min matches except for CM Punk will be
in<00:00:49.320> there<00:00:49.469> but<00:00:50.160> also<00:00:50.430> Sun<00:00:51.390> better<00:00:51.660> would<00:00:51.870> be

00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:52.039 
in there but also Sun better would be

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:55.880 
in there but also Sun better would be
since<00:00:53.039> Rollins<00:00:53.550> turned<00:00:54.149> on<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.660> shield<00:00:54.960> you

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
since Rollins turned on the shield you

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.670 
since Rollins turned on the shield you
can<00:00:55.920> have<00:00:56.160> Punk<00:00:56.550> fill<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.090> role<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.680> Rollins

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
can have Punk fill the role of Rollins

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.090 
can have Punk fill the role of Rollins
and<00:00:59.039> how<00:00:59.489> about<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.789> shield<00:01:00.000> be<00:01:00.270> evolution

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
and how about the shield be evolution

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.799 
and how about the shield be evolution
you<00:01:02.100> know<00:01:02.219> that's<00:01:02.489> very<00:01:02.609> possible<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.480> it

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
you know that's very possible and it

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.530 
you know that's very possible and it
sounds<00:01:04.199> really<00:01:04.530> cool<00:01:04.710> if<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:04.949> can<00:01:05.129> do<00:01:05.220> it<00:01:05.250> and

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540
