gigabytes and the clips that will attach
themselves<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.829> that<00:00:50.250> fan<00:00:51.090> casing<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:51.960> that

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
themselves to that fan casing and that

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.350 
themselves to that fan casing and that
fan<00:00:52.559> casing<00:00:53.010> then<00:00:53.160> goes<00:00:53.370> on<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.789> sides<00:00:54.059> of

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
fan casing then goes on the sides of

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.319 
fan casing then goes on the sides of
this<00:00:54.719> hyperx<00:00:55.410> memory<00:00:55.980> now<00:00:56.430> this<00:00:56.640> is<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.789> classic

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
this hyperx memory now this is a classic

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.610 
this hyperx memory now this is a classic
style<00:00:57.629> with<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.809> heat<00:00:58.050> spreaders<00:00:58.500> the

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
style with the heat spreaders the

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.830 
style with the heat spreaders the
aluminum<00:00:59.010> heat<00:00:59.820> spreaders<00:01:00.239> as<00:01:00.420> you<00:01:00.539> can<00:01:00.690> see

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
aluminum heat spreaders as you can see

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.569 
aluminum heat spreaders as you can see
at<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.079> top<00:01:01.109> here<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:02.039> that's<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.399> pretty

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
at the top here so that's a pretty

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.030 
at the top here so that's a pretty
effective<00:01:02.760> design<00:01:03.300> allows<00:01:04.140> air<00:01:04.439> flow<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.799> go

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
effective design allows air flow to go

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.510 
effective design allows air flow to go
through<00:01:05.339> it<00:01:05.489> easily<00:01:06.020> very<00:01:07.020> thin<00:01:07.530> okay<00:01:08.250> so<00:01:08.310> it

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
through it easily very thin okay so it

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.060 
through it easily very thin okay so it
doesn't<00:01:08.880> interfere<00:01:09.150> with<00:01:09.750> other<00:01:10.290> memory<00:01:10.860> and

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
doesn't interfere with other memory and

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.490 
doesn't interfere with other memory and
of<00:01:11.220> course<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:12.479> airflow<00:01:12.960> going<00:01:13.260> in<00:01:13.380> between

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
of course the airflow going in between

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.760 
of course the airflow going in between
the<00:01:13.830> memory<00:01:14.100> modules<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.869> this<00:01:15.869> is<00:01:16.080> one<00:01:16.500> point

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
the memory modules and this is one point

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.980 
the memory modules and this is one point
six<00:01:17.009> five<00:01:17.159> volts<00:01:17.700> which<00:01:17.909> is<00:01:18.119> recommended<00:01:18.869> by

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
six five volts which is recommended by

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.230 
six five volts which is recommended by
Intel<00:01:19.380> so<00:01:19.650> we<00:01:19.860> don't<00:01:20.009> want<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.280> really<00:01:20.729> exceed

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
Intel so we don't want to really exceed

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.960 
Intel so we don't want to really exceed
that<00:01:21.420> voltage<00:01:22.220> because<00:01:23.220> of<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.490> memory

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
that voltage because of the memory

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.520 
that voltage because of the memory
controllers<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.810> way<00:01:24.900> things<00:01:24.960> are<00:01:25.350> set

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
controllers and the way things are set

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.090 
controllers and the way things are set
up<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:26.330> also<00:01:27.330> another<00:01:28.290> thing<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.740> point<00:01:28.920> out

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
up and also another thing to point out

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.749 
up and also another thing to point out
here<00:01:29.159> is<00:01:29.490> that<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.420> fan<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.619> blue<00:01:31.920> LED<00:01:32.430> fans

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
here is that the fan the blue LED fans

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.719 
here is that the fan the blue LED fans
that<00:01:33.270> come<00:01:33.720> in<00:01:33.869> here<00:01:34.110> really<00:01:34.920> complement<00:01:35.610> the

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
that come in here really complement the

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.940 
that come in here really complement the
whole<00:01:35.880> design<00:01:36.270> because<00:01:36.630> it's<00:01:36.810> all<00:01:36.990> blue<00:01:37.380> right

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
whole design because it's all blue right

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.240 
you put the clip underneath not on top
okay<00:02:06.600> so<00:02:06.660> don't<00:02:07.020> put<00:02:07.170> it<00:02:07.260> on<00:02:07.350> top<00:02:07.530> like<00:02:07.590> that<00:02:07.830> it

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
okay so don't put it on top like that it

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.670 
okay so don't put it on top like that it
goes<00:02:08.540> underneath<00:02:09.540> instead<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.320> then<00:02:10.530> you

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:10.680 
goes underneath instead and then you

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.360 
goes underneath instead and then you
just<00:02:10.920> attach<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.690> the<00:02:12.690> screws<00:02:13.050> onto<00:02:13.440> it<00:02:14.160> so

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
just attach the the screws onto it so

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.100 
just attach the the screws onto it so
let<00:02:14.790> me<00:02:14.880> just<00:02:15.030> quickly<00:02:15.210> show<00:02:15.450> you<00:02:15.630> here<00:02:15.900> just

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
let me just quickly show you here just

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.380 
let me just quickly show you here just
put<00:02:16.290> them<00:02:16.470> underneath<00:02:16.920> there<00:02:17.370> and<00:02:20.300> then<00:02:21.300> you

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
put them underneath there and then you

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.180 
put them underneath there and then you
get<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.990> thumb<00:02:22.350> screws<00:02:22.620> that<00:02:22.800> it<00:02:22.920> comes<00:02:23.100> with

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
get the thumb screws that it comes with

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.300 
get the thumb screws that it comes with
just<00:02:24.180> attach<00:02:24.300> it<00:02:24.690> in<00:02:24.780> there<00:02:24.990> and<00:02:25.140> they<00:02:25.710> do<00:02:26.130> that

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
just attach it in there and they do that

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.060 
just attach it in there and they do that
to<00:02:26.490> the<00:02:26.610> four<00:02:27.110> sides<00:02:28.110> of<00:02:28.410> course<00:02:28.590> of<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:28.860> four

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
to the four sides of course of the four

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.950 
to the four sides of course of the four
corners<00:02:29.640> and<00:02:29.820> then<00:02:30.180> you're<00:02:30.300> all<00:02:30.420> set<00:02:30.450> now<00:02:30.900> you

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
corners and then you're all set now you

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.100 
corners and then you're all set now you
can<00:02:31.170> just<00:02:31.430> plug<00:02:32.430> in<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:32.820> power<00:02:33.570> connector

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
can just plug in the power connector

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.370 
can just plug in the power connector
there<00:02:34.290> onto<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:34.920> board<00:02:35.280> and<00:02:35.520> then<00:02:36.480> clip<00:02:36.840> this

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
there onto the board and then clip this

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.040 
there onto the board and then clip this
on<00:02:37.650> to<00:02:37.710> the<00:02:38.400> dimm<00:02:38.610> slots<00:02:38.790> okay<00:02:39.630> so<00:02:39.690> on<00:02:39.900> either

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
on to the dimm slots okay so on either

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.320 
on to the dimm slots okay so on either
side<00:02:40.350> of<00:02:40.380> your<00:02:40.530> dim<00:02:40.740> slot<00:02:41.010> it<00:02:41.310> would<00:02:41.820> clip<00:02:42.120> on

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
side of your dim slot it would clip on

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.840 
side of your dim slot it would clip on
so<00:02:42.600> there<00:02:42.810> are<00:02:43.020> the<00:02:43.470> memory<00:02:43.770> modules<00:02:44.250> without

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
so there are the memory modules without

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.000 
so there are the memory modules without
the<00:02:45.210> fan<00:02:45.480> and<00:02:45.750> you<00:02:46.020> can<00:02:46.320> see<00:02:46.620> it<00:02:46.830> doesn't

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
the fan and you can see it doesn't

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.660 
the fan and you can see it doesn't
really<00:02:47.490> conflict<00:02:48.390> or<00:02:48.600> touch<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:49.670> cooler

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
really conflict or touch the cooler

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.290 
really conflict or touch the cooler
master<00:02:51.090> v6<00:02:52.160> fan<00:02:53.160> and<00:02:53.459> then<00:02:53.520> I<00:02:53.610> just<00:02:53.790> clipped<00:02:54.090> on

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
master v6 fan and then I just clipped on

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.160 
master v6 fan and then I just clipped on
the<00:02:54.650> HyperX<00:02:55.650> fan<00:02:56.160> and<00:02:56.430> we<00:02:57.420> got<00:02:57.540> a<00:02:57.570> nice<00:02:57.810> cool

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
the HyperX fan and we got a nice cool

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.470 
the HyperX fan and we got a nice cool
blue<00:02:58.530> theme<00:02:58.830> going<00:02:59.100> on<00:02:59.310> there<00:02:59.550> now<00:03:00.120> while

can play around with those because if

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.110 
can play around with those because if
you're<00:03:46.080> changing<00:03:46.620> the<00:03:46.830> latencies<00:03:47.610> then<00:03:47.970> you

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
you're changing the latencies then you

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.240 
you're changing the latencies then you
want<00:03:48.330> to<00:03:48.480> change<00:03:48.750> the<00:03:48.989> frequency<00:03:49.560> as<00:03:49.680> well<00:03:49.920> to

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
want to change the frequency as well to

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.150 
want to change the frequency as well to

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
come to a stable amount but if you don't

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.500 
come to a stable amount but if you don't
want<00:03:53.340> to<00:03:53.489> overclock<00:03:53.820> it<00:03:53.940> then<00:03:54.209> you<00:03:54.300> just

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
want to overclock it then you just

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.600 
want to overclock it then you just

824<00:04:03.990> okay<00:04:04.740> and<00:04:04.830> if<00:04:04.890> you're<00:04:04.980> not<00:04:05.070> sure<00:04:05.130> what<00:04:05.520> to

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
824 okay and if you're not sure what to

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.580 
824 okay and if you're not sure what to
put<00:04:05.850> in<00:04:06.000> there<00:04:06.210> well<00:04:06.750> you<00:04:06.900> can<00:04:07.050> always<00:04:07.260> choose

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
put in there well you can always choose

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.480 
put in there well you can always choose
the<00:04:07.650> auto<00:04:08.030> settings<00:04:09.030> so<00:04:09.770> the<00:04:10.770> auto<00:04:10.980> settings

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.490 
the auto settings so the auto settings

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.460 
the auto settings so the auto settings
up<00:04:11.670> just<00:04:12.060> automatically<00:04:12.600> chooses<00:04:12.990> the<00:04:13.350> right

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
up just automatically chooses the right

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.250 
up just automatically chooses the right
value<00:04:13.980> that<00:04:14.220> is<00:04:14.400> stable<00:04:15.270> okay<00:04:15.930> and<00:04:16.079> then<00:04:16.170> you

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
value that is stable okay and then you

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.840 
value that is stable okay and then you
can<00:04:16.380> run<00:04:16.530> some<00:04:16.680> benchmarks<00:04:16.859> and<00:04:17.400> test<00:04:17.609> it<00:04:17.760> out

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
can run some benchmarks and test it out

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.530 
can run some benchmarks and test it out
so<00:04:18.299> let's<00:04:18.600> do<00:04:18.750> that<00:04:18.780> okay<00:04:19.500> so<00:04:19.560> here<00:04:19.980> we<00:04:20.100> are<00:04:20.280> in

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:02.790 
the memory sweet scores and there you

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:04.969 
the memory sweet scores and there you
can<00:06:02.970> see<00:06:03.000> the<00:06:03.810> results<00:06:04.350> that<00:06:04.380> I<00:06:04.470> got<00:06:04.710> with<00:06:04.950> a

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:04.979 
can see the results that I got with a

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:08.450 
can see the results that I got with a
default<00:06:05.520> XMP<00:06:06.479> profile<00:06:06.930> compared<00:06:07.470> to<00:06:07.650> an<00:06:08.040> ocz

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 
default XMP profile compared to an ocz

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.719 
default XMP profile compared to an ocz
profile<00:06:09.060> I<00:06:09.270> also<00:06:09.780> compared<00:06:10.380> it<00:06:10.560> in<00:06:10.740> the

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:11.729 
profile I also compared it in the

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:14.690 
profile I also compared it in the
superpipe<00:06:12.770> calculation<00:06:13.770> so<00:06:13.950> this<00:06:14.160> calculates

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:14.700 
superpipe calculation so this calculates

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.770 
superpipe calculation so this calculates
PI<00:06:14.970> 2<00:06:15.260> 1,000,000<00:06:16.260> decimals<00:06:16.890> for<00:06:17.039> example

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:17.780 
PI 2 1,000,000 decimals for example

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:22.040 
PI 2 1,000,000 decimals for example
10.35<00:06:18.830> seconds<00:06:19.830> at<00:06:20.010> the<00:06:20.460> default<00:06:20.880> XMP<00:06:21.539> profile

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.050 
10.35 seconds at the default XMP profile

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:26.060 
10.35 seconds at the default XMP profile
cl9<00:06:22.650> if<00:06:22.950> I<00:06:23.550> change<00:06:24.240> it<00:06:24.390> to<00:06:24.510> see<00:06:24.720> l<00:06:24.840> eight<00:06:25.050> ok<00:06:26.010> so

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:26.070 
cl9 if I change it to see l eight ok so

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.339 
cl9 if I change it to see l eight ok so
we're<00:06:26.310> overclocking<00:06:26.880> it<00:06:26.970> a<00:06:27.000> little<00:06:27.120> bit<00:06:27.349> 9.99

00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:28.349 
we're overclocking it a little bit 9.99

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:31.730 
we're overclocking it a little bit 9.99
seconds<00:06:29.039> so<00:06:29.099> it's<00:06:29.250> faster<00:06:29.760> at<00:06:29.940> CL<00:06:30.270> eight<00:06:30.740> so

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:31.740 
seconds so it's faster at CL eight so

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:32.839 
seconds so it's faster at CL eight so
we're<00:06:31.860> trying<00:06:31.950> to<00:06:32.099> come<00:06:32.250> to<00:06:32.370> a<00:06:32.400> happy<00:06:32.520> medium

00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:32.849 
we're trying to come to a happy medium

00:06:32.849 --> 00:06:35.540 
we're trying to come to a happy medium
here<00:06:33.360> trying<00:06:34.050> to<00:06:34.140> overclock<00:06:34.530> things<00:06:34.919> very

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:35.550 
here trying to overclock things very

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:38.600 
here trying to overclock things very
stable<00:06:35.849> I<00:06:36.240> like<00:06:36.630> this<00:06:36.810> memory<00:06:37.370> reviewed<00:06:38.370> the<00:06:38.580> a

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:38.610 
stable I like this memory reviewed the a

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:41.710 
stable I like this memory reviewed the a
dual-channel<00:06:39.270> and<00:06:39.599> it<00:06:40.229> works<00:06:40.710> just<00:06:40.860> as<00:06:41.280> good

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:41.720 
dual-channel and it works just as good

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.450 
dual-channel and it works just as good
even<00:06:42.720> better<00:06:42.930> actually<00:06:43.200> because<00:06:44.130> the

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:44.460 
even better actually because the

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.610 
even better actually because the
overclocking<00:06:45.000> and<00:06:45.270> the<00:06:45.330> XMP<00:06:45.780> profile<00:06:46.200> really

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:46.620 
overclocking and the XMP profile really

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:48.980 
overclocking and the XMP profile really
does<00:06:46.800> help<00:06:47.070> so<00:06:47.700> I<00:06:48.060> definitely<00:06:48.270> recommend<00:06:48.539> this

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:48.990 
does help so I definitely recommend this
