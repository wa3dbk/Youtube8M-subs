00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.819
 Greetings is a hammer blow for everyone at 

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:07.850
 titan hammer to bring you a mode of 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:09.900
 very particular map as you see I am here 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.719
 in my hammer world 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.459
 and I'm also using the mini map 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.470
 that he usually uses that is more 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:18.539
 brighter I have it here in the corner 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.700
 top right and I like it 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.669
 especially because in addition to the miner 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:26.570
 gang has this world map which one 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:30.750
 Once explored, I can see it again 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:32.610
 move the map itself to see other areas 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.830
 further north or in any direction 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.059
 As long as I have not explored, I've already 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.739
 saying 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.739
 well, there are also others like network 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.080
 minimum or boxer map and I bring you one 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:47.220
 very particular that I have it here in the 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:50.400
 hand is called antich map and it consists 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:53.940
 basically on a real map it would not be 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:56.670
 like the mini maps these but we 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.519
 makes an old map in the style of 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.739
 RPG of cell-type RPGs and 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:03.839
 others for the lovers of the games 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.610
 retro sure they will love it and 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:08.490
 also for certain game mode 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:12.090
 first of all the crafter 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:15.329
 it's like a book and with a compass here 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.850
 we have the empty atlas 

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:21.450
 we give you a right click and as you can see 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.250
 changed the color here and now it would be the 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.750
 back number 1 which is what we have in 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.110
 The hand can be made more than one 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.369
 and here we have it looks tiny looks 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.679
 is tiny because of the size of the 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.560
 interface I have the interface here in 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:37.979
 normal size but if I put it in more 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.709
 big or on automatic you're going to see it 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.679
 see a lot bigger, well, you see 

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:46.649
 which is like the old games of 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:51.270
 role this is the sea 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:53.490
 these are swamps this would be good here 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.409
 these jobs is that here is an area 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.119
 mixed swamp and manga 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:01.399
 this would be the sand and so on 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:04.020
 yes the constructions do not 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:06.780
 identifies only with the soil identify 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.819
 the land we can move it 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.090
 that would also be a world map but of 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:14.280
 special style here we have the scale 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:17.340
 16 32 blocks so we know 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.740
 that these are this would be a jung is 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.230
 by chung that everything would be a chin these 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.910
 would be two an etcetera and then we have 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.120
 here the possibility of adding markers 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.340
 or even export the image as 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.720
 it's pretty cool pretty curious I 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.120
 I can for example here and add a 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.390
 bookmark mark the site where we are 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.989
 which is the lighthouse and we can put here lighthouse 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:44.340
 we can also select the type here 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:47.550
 of signal that we want to be here the x is 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.680
 the smallest x or a house we are going to 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:54.090
 put that and notice that I have it here 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:57.200
 good lighthouse because I can move and like 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.930
 see also moves him 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.920
 the cursor and obviously it's also going 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.680
 exploring more map 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.080
 I can also choose to follow the 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.670
 player 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:12.320
 in this way when moving I would go 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.240
 moving the map with me or if I 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.940
 dragged so I'm marking the address 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:20.060
 that I want we are going to put for example 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.100
 let's remove a for the escape to 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.700
 close it and for example let's come 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.320
 here at home to put another marker or 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.980
 we put for example here right where 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:32.580
 there is the hammer 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:35.730
 right here we give you right click and here 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:38.090
 would be where the house is going to have 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:42.080
 another marker 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:43.670
 here and we put houses and we give to echo 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.069
 you see 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:50.060
 I for example let's put another 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:53.060
 marker more than another type then look 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.970
 let's go here for example here 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.530
 we have in the tower led from the 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.410
 quarters 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.860
 and let's get right here we give 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:05.260
 right click we open it 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.860
 and here we are we can put the 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.010
 marker 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:14.210
 having here we select the type by 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:16.310
 example here I put watchtower 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:19.280
 with what you see we can put 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:22.970
 different things and you can also do 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:26.290
 zoom and you can also zoom out is very 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:28.500
 well especially if you want to play a 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:32.820
 modality 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:36.360
 for example in hard modes or for example 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:39.630
 an adventure game in medieval plan or 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.400
 something like this really the map and the minimap 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.950
 that we usually have gives us 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.330
 too many advantages and then if 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.460
 You want to have a little more 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.980
 difficulty because this is good because you 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:53.940
 helps to guide us but at the same time 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:57.270
 It is not as simple and as easy as 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:59.130
 it would be with a mini maps in which you see 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.690
 all geographical features and all 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.760
 others then it would be in plan more 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:06.150
 adventurers then you can also 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:09.350
 erase the marker in this way and 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:12.040
 We can give here to export the image 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:16.070
 We give you here and select to save 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:18.800
 my documents whatever we want 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:20.840
 I'm going to close it and nothing has no more 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:24.380
 story simply a book cure occupies 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:27.290
 spaces in the inventory like a book 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:30.560
 normal and I tell you that especially for 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:33.080
 thematic like that in retro style with mode 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.810
 difficult or things like that we go with the 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:38.720
 installation I have it here for 164 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:40.790
 172 and 17 10 when it comes out for versions 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.400
 later in the links of the 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:44.630
 description locate and equally in 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:48.050
 first place we will go here to 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:50.150
 percentage app data percentage and within 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:52.670
 from the minecraft folder well we take 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:54.080
 the content and we move it to another route or 

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:56.230
 well we changed the name this folder 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.480
 to make the installation none empty 

00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:01.520
 then we will run the launcher and 

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.660
 we give here is this profile for 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.610
 select the version that we are going to 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:07.130
 install me for example 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:09.980
 exam to 17 10 so for example let's 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:11.630
 to give to 1 72 as I said when 

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.670
 you win for later versions 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:15.620
 you will also have it in the description 

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:18.530
 We give the play button and install the 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:21.280
 necessary files then it opens 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:23.860
 the game and we close it 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.240
 now let's install because I have 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.889
 here all the recommended versions 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:29.560
 all will also be in the 

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:31.990
 description we extract the corresponding 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:34.780
 in this case the 172 and we give 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:36.669
 Right click to open with java platform or 

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:38.590
 the broken installation is the same as 

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:40.690
 by default so we give it to 

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:43.690
 accept install the fort files 

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:46.180
 we give him to accept again we come back 

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:48.010
 again to open the launcher we give 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:50.710
 here where are the profiles and 

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:52.540
 we select the new fort and before 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:54.669
 to give the play comment that this 

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:57.730
 it comes out here in case you install the 

00:06:54.669 --> 00:07:00.190
 new minecraft installer that still 

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:01.480
 I think that only the only thing that's going to premium 

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:04.210
 do is going to be changing the route of 

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:06.190
 installation program files but the 

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:08.710
 way to install the moody 's and 

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:11.230
 others remains the same we give to the 

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:13.360
 open play button play it again 

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:16.240
 we close again and now we're going to 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:19.570
 install the mode I have it here for each 

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:22.210
 I copy it and I go to percentage 

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:26.650
 app data percentage 

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:29.319
 and inside minecraft we paste it open 

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:31.150
 once again the game and here we have it 

00:07:29.319 --> 00:07:33.880
 here is the mods button here are 

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:36.669
 the de force and here is antich atlas 

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:38.470
 which will give us no problem 

00:07:36.669 --> 00:07:40.449
 nothing more if you liked it like 

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:43.860
 subscribe and do not forget to share 

00:07:40.449 --> 00:07:43.860
