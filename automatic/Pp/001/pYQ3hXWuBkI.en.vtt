00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 good afternoon to all the boys and 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:07.980
 welcome to this new tutorial on 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:10.920
 how to build in quotation marks in 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:14.420
 just the hooks harry potter 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.460
 I had an inspiration today 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:21.720
 then I come immediately to explain myself 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:24.170
 we were cutting down trees 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.930
 oaks in 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:29.060
 the most specific way because they were made 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.279
 too high and bothered some 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.710
 power wires all right thanks 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.290
 in place that we care now we will 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.830
 I explain that you do not care then 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:42.980
 I don't know how many of you maybe have 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:47.830
 in its genons the former of the oaks 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:52.280
 if you took the chance the oak 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:54.320
 brings back these strange fruits which then do not 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.860
 day and less large orchard type 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.769
 see they make these kind of balls 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:03.739
 which have the consistency of wood and 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:09.830
 we are the roughly wood you see 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:13.490
 that remain here which they serve 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.440
 nothing they gave to eat once a 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.200
 who had animals in the country though 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.860
 obviously today they are completely useless 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.020
 however as you can see they are enough 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.060
 fun to see they look like balls 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:31.039
 of wood are wooden balls 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:33.399
 perfectly round and obviously there 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:35.509
 therefore they are of all sizes 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:38.810
 let's go get a little bit of 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:40.789
 these balls you see are not 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.649
 right there the use the zoom because 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:44.060
 otherwise I suck they have one 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:47.840
 kind of 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:50.390
 of circus center all knurled than there 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.729
 where it remains to expand because these 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:56.810
 they grow to become perfectly 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:58.850
 round generally they also fall though 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.840
 when they fall they are no longer good because 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:05.210
 it turns out that you see them talking like 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.330
 this is a buchetto you see 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.950
 ie I don't use zug because giving just does 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.080
 once there is the hole state pur 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.110
 sure that inside there is some beast that 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:18.200
 he did the den, however, once he had done it 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:21.200
 a selection of these very strange ones 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:25.040
 we can create a gadget ball 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.260
 by harry potter and i think someone already 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:31.099
 he arrived because it is not what he wants 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.790
 an art what we need an oak from 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:35.060
 to break down 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:38.239
 no i'm kidding no oak from 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.280
 knock down even a small garden 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.959
 that maybe you're thrown there 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.420
 however the oak these you can 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:48.470
 find on the ground or on the branches then 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:50.660
 some of these wooden balls that 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.730
 I'm not sure of the exact size 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.579
 did you notice a gold snitch that 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.650
 it will be the gadget that we will go to 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:00.040
 create I didn't want to say it but it's obvious 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.660
 what i want to create today so 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:06.140
 then obviously you need to have you 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:08.350
 take away the leaves elena thing 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.090
 impossible but with one hand 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:14.810
 in short, you have to work the mouthpiece if 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:17.900
 you have a boxcutter file you remove 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.940
 if there is still what's called it 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.910
 the stem that kept it attached 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.370
 in short, look for the plant to work it 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.989
 so long as it remains perfectly 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.790
 round here 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.459
 once you have worked them a 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.650
 little bit with a paper file 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.959
 in short, when you made them almost glass 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.299
 perfectly round to the touch because 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.579
 just roundabouts are not though 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:41.980
 let's just make it something a lot 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:44.540
 similar 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:48.860
 in short it must be smooth but must be 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:51.020
 a ball then you try procure a 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.610
 piece of cardboard this for example a 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:58.280
 I don't know if it's a box lid 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:04:01.400
 of shoes and then you need or 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:04.720
 tempera or this one is really a 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:07.040
 color for outdoors that obviously 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.959
 advanced because I doubt he went to 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.819
 buy but don't cost much from 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:14.600
 parliament 2 euros and something 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:17.239
 these pale gold practically dark of 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.190
 loot is basically we have to do 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.650
 this operation or we do it inside 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.200
 with a carton waiting for you or the 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:27.080
 let's take out the outside so that 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:29.930
 we don't dirty an accident for sure 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:34.729
 don't do it like i'm doing it with 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:38.110
 one hand because if I don't know that 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:43.160
 comes out we have to color run away 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:45.500
 then a moment a moment because I have to 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:48.400
 color to him and nothing else and he is not 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.400
 easy 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:59.860
 here is ok 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:05.720
 sorry if I do n't talk I'm looking at how 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:12.700
 as seen school rolls and rolls here 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:19.270
 just so minute the grandmother rolls from 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:25.420
 you have nothing cooperates 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:25.420
 put yourself firmly and beauty 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.400
 of course we must give more than one 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:33.020
 hand this is little but sure 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.090
 because we will hardly be able to 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:38.270
 color it all when in one hand 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:41.840
 you see gold reducing opaque gold will seem 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:44.270
 a snitch and in fact this is the thing goes 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.370
 well I obviously find myself in it 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:48.490
 now I do the same operation with 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:51.980
 all the balls 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:54.200
 sorry I don't need two hands with two 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:59.690
 hands all over, look at how many 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:06:02.060
 you think you sell gold or gold boy 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:04.370
 take two and pay 3 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:07.250
 so it's a bargain then you see 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:10.460
 clearly they are identical and precise 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:14.180
 because the size is the color 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:16.580
 the one you now obviously see are shiny 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:19.820
 we have given one but a first hand 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:22.130
 now sorry mom my do it 

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:24.200
 I recommend it to you outdoors 

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:27.110
 indeed it is really a law you have to do it 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:30.400
 outdoors I am intoxicated now 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:30.400
 once they are dry 

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:36.980
 so this I think will be enough 24 hours 

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:39.770
 take a day and a half dax released at 

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:42.880
 only or if released outside 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:45.980
 then roll them and see if 

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:47.960
 let's say there are areas that haven't been 

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:49.280
 colored because I searched more or less 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.940
 to beat them everywhere too 

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.680
 picturing 

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:54.410
 roll though if there is any left 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:57.530
 area is that failed we decide 

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:59.570
 another pushed to the end then 

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:02.690
 you see amazing as a ball of 

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:05.420
 this age can become a snitch 

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:07.190
 then as soon as they are dry 

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:11.510
 but obviously this in the next 

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:12.440
 video I will show you how to make wings and 

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:15.800
 to the finishes 

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:17.720
 well guys for today it's all put 

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:20.020
 leave a comment put a like me 

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:23.450
 obviously if the video on 

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:26.720
 you liked it I don't know if there are any 

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:28.820
 noticed but I'm all of us with 

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.890
 this channel to reach almost a thousand 

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:36.440
 members then get camilli once 

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:38.540
 I'll have to do something phantasmagoric no 

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:42.980
 joke to something a little bit 

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:44.510
 different so also to celebrate 

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:48.200
 that we have reached a thousand members 

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:49.730
 so if you have an idea of ​​what 

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:51.520
 I could never do 

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:53.600
 not a few videos here of something 

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:56.120
 sensational or something 

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:58.450
 extravagant leave it written either 

00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:00.890
 comedy, in short, let me know yours 

00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:03.440
 well that's all 

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:04.430
 I greet you and we'll see you in 

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:07.480
 early 

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:07.480
 Hi guys
