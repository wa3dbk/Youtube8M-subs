00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
Matassa fit replica and I'm like oh yeah

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.800 
Matassa fit replica and I'm like oh yeah
I<00:04:41.830> mean<00:04:42.070> I'm<00:04:42.250> down<00:04:42.430> cuz<00:04:43.210> I've<00:04:43.330> always<00:04:43.660> as<00:04:43.780> a

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
I mean I'm down cuz I've always as a

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.540 
I mean I'm down cuz I've always as a
little<00:04:44.110> guy<00:04:44.229> I<00:04:44.260> would<00:04:44.680> study<00:04:45.220> all<00:04:45.430> the

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
little guy I would study all the

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.340 
little guy I would study all the
catalogs<00:04:46.030> I<00:04:46.360> wore<00:04:46.570> all<00:04:46.600> the<00:04:46.960> same<00:04:47.139> gear

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
catalogs I wore all the same gear

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.860 
catalogs I wore all the same gear
Matassa<00:04:47.740> which<00:04:47.979> had<00:04:48.240> begging<00:04:49.240> my<00:04:49.360> dad<00:04:49.570> for

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
Matassa which had begging my dad for

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.270 
Matassa which had begging my dad for
this<00:04:49.960> chest<00:04:50.260> protector<00:04:50.710> those<00:04:50.889> gloves

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
this chest protector those gloves

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.280 
this chest protector those gloves
whatever<00:04:51.820> cuz<00:04:52.389> I've<00:04:52.540> always<00:04:52.810> been<00:04:52.930> kind<00:04:53.200> of

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290 
whatever cuz I've always been kind of

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:56.100 
whatever cuz I've always been kind of
like<00:04:53.410> pretty<00:04:54.310> pumped<00:04:54.550> on<00:04:54.760> my<00:04:54.850> look<00:04:55.090> and<00:04:55.510> and<00:04:55.750> I

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
like pretty pumped on my look and and I

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.350 
like pretty pumped on my look and and I
think<00:04:56.169> this<00:04:56.500> guy<00:04:56.650> was<00:04:56.680> super<00:04:57.580> influential<00:04:58.240> on

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
think this guy was super influential on

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.570 
think this guy was super influential on
that<00:04:58.600> as<00:04:58.780> a<00:04:58.840> little<00:04:59.830> guy<00:04:59.919> I<00:04:59.950> would<00:05:00.160> always<00:05:00.310> try

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
that as a little guy I would always try

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:01.800 
that as a little guy I would always try
to<00:05:00.639> watch<00:05:01.000> the<00:05:01.120> race<00:05:01.270> as<00:05:01.419> much<00:05:01.600> as<00:05:01.690> I<00:05:01.750> can

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
to watch the race as much as I can

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.750 
to watch the race as much as I can
because<00:05:02.080> obviously<00:05:02.290> they<00:05:02.590> the<00:05:03.460> coverage

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
because obviously they the coverage

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.029 
because obviously they the coverage
wasn't<00:05:04.030> as<00:05:04.090> good<00:05:04.240> as<00:05:04.330> is<00:05:04.479> now<00:05:04.660> but<00:05:04.960> to<00:05:05.830> come<00:05:05.950> out

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:06.039 
wasn't as good as is now but to come out

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:07.529 
wasn't as good as is now but to come out
here<00:05:06.220> and<00:05:06.310> ride<00:05:06.460> a<00:05:06.520> bike<00:05:06.820> in<00:05:07.000> which<00:05:07.150> he<00:05:07.360> almost

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:07.539 
here and ride a bike in which he almost

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:09.270 
here and ride a bike in which he almost
won<00:05:07.810> the<00:05:07.840> series<00:05:08.200> on<00:05:08.350> is<00:05:08.620> it's<00:05:09.070> a<00:05:09.130> good

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
won the series on is it's a good

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.260 
won the series on is it's a good
experience<00:05:09.460> to<00:05:09.669> come<00:05:09.789> out<00:05:09.880> here<00:05:09.970> and<00:05:10.000> hang<00:05:10.180> out

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
experience to come out here and hang out

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.540 
experience to come out here and hang out
with<00:05:10.450> Jeff<00:05:11.260> and<00:05:11.620> do<00:05:11.949> a<00:05:11.979> little<00:05:12.130> riding<00:05:12.280> on<00:05:12.430> this

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
with Jeff and do a little riding on this

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.900 
with Jeff and do a little riding on this
old<00:05:12.699> bike<00:05:14.039> honestly<00:05:15.039> over<00:05:15.190> the<00:05:15.370> years<00:05:15.610> all<00:05:15.880> the

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:15.910 
old bike honestly over the years all the

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:17.159 
old bike honestly over the years all the
bikes<00:05:16.300> that<00:05:16.449> seem<00:05:16.630> to<00:05:16.750> be<00:05:16.810> getting<00:05:16.960> a<00:05:17.080> little

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:17.169 
bikes that seem to be getting a little

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:19.490 
bikes that seem to be getting a little
bit<00:05:17.320> more<00:05:17.470> rigid<00:05:17.680> and<00:05:18.039> I<00:05:18.370> think<00:05:18.610> this<00:05:18.789> was<00:05:19.060> uh

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
bit more rigid and I think this was uh

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.320 
bit more rigid and I think this was uh
it's<00:05:20.500> had<00:05:20.680> the<00:05:20.770> most<00:05:20.979> grip<00:05:21.700> on<00:05:21.880> the<00:05:21.970> front<00:05:22.240> end

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330 
it's had the most grip on the front end

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:23.940 
it's had the most grip on the front end
of<00:05:22.479> any<00:05:22.600> bike<00:05:22.810> I've<00:05:22.930> ever<00:05:22.990> ridden<00:05:23.320> honestly<00:05:23.770> I

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:23.950 
of any bike I've ever ridden honestly I

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:25.650 
of any bike I've ever ridden honestly I
could<00:05:24.100> see<00:05:24.280> where<00:05:24.490> it<00:05:24.850> was<00:05:25.150> probably<00:05:25.479> pretty

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:25.660 
could see where it was probably pretty

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.300 
could see where it was probably pretty
good<00:05:25.780> for<00:05:26.050> Supercross

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
good for Supercross

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:28.920 
good for Supercross
I<00:05:27.340> mean<00:05:27.820> I<00:05:27.880> think<00:05:27.940> it's<00:05:28.360> obviously<00:05:28.750> in

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
I mean I think it's obviously in

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.870 
I mean I think it's obviously in
standard<00:05:29.320> form<00:05:29.530> so<00:05:29.620> it<00:05:30.460> feels<00:05:30.610> like<00:05:30.760> the

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
standard form so it feels like the

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.490 
standard form so it feels like the
wheelbase<00:05:31.210> is<00:05:31.419> pretty<00:05:31.630> short<00:05:31.930> and<00:05:32.050> that<00:05:32.200> turns

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.500 
wheelbase is pretty short and that turns

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.020 
wheelbase is pretty short and that turns
super<00:05:32.889> tight<00:05:33.099> like<00:05:33.280> the<00:05:33.370> clamps<00:05:33.700> are<00:05:33.789> really

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030 
super tight like the clamps are really

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:36.510 
super tight like the clamps are really
really<00:05:34.479> tight<00:05:34.690> on<00:05:34.720> it<00:05:34.990> so<00:05:35.200> yeah<00:05:36.070> I<00:05:36.099> could<00:05:36.370> see

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 
really tight on it so yeah I could see

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.560 
really tight on it so yeah I could see
where<00:05:36.700> it<00:05:36.729> would<00:05:36.910> be<00:05:37.060> a<00:05:37.090> good<00:05:37.270> bike<00:05:37.450> in

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:37.570 
where it would be a good bike in

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.900 
where it would be a good bike in
Supercross<00:05:37.960> especially<00:05:38.530> with<00:05:38.680> how<00:05:38.860> the<00:05:38.919> the

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:39.910 
Supercross especially with how the the

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:41.670 
Supercross especially with how the the
frame<00:05:40.180> set<00:05:40.450> up<00:05:40.570> with<00:05:40.720> this<00:05:40.840> little<00:05:41.139> link<00:05:41.349> thing

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 
frame set up with this little link thing

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.710 
frame set up with this little link thing
and<00:05:42.039> where<00:05:42.340> the<00:05:42.460> shock<00:05:42.910> mounts<00:05:43.270> so<00:05:43.360> it<00:05:43.450> made<00:05:43.599> it

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
and where the shock mounts so it made it

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.170 
and where the shock mounts so it made it
even<00:05:43.780> more<00:05:44.580> flexible<00:05:45.580> I<00:05:45.700> guess<00:05:45.880> which<00:05:46.060> would

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:46.180 
even more flexible I guess which would

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.870 
even more flexible I guess which would
probably<00:05:46.450> add<00:05:46.539> grip<00:05:46.900> and<00:05:47.139> loops<00:05:47.380> and<00:05:47.560> such<00:05:47.740> so

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880 
probably add grip and loops and such so

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.370 
probably add grip and loops and such so
I<00:05:49.000> could<00:05:49.360> see<00:05:49.510> where<00:05:49.660> it<00:05:49.690> may<00:05:49.840> be<00:05:49.870> a<00:05:49.990> bit<00:05:50.200> of<00:05:50.290> an

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:50.380 
I could see where it may be a bit of an

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:51.750 
I could see where it may be a bit of an
issue<00:05:50.500> for<00:05:50.860> someone<00:05:51.070> who<00:05:51.130> had<00:05:51.250> a<00:05:51.280> lot<00:05:51.460> of<00:05:51.490> time

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:51.760 
issue for someone who had a lot of time

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.270 
issue for someone who had a lot of time
on<00:05:52.000> it<00:05:52.150> it's<00:05:52.720> like<00:05:52.840> a<00:05:52.960> consumer<00:05:53.710> bike<00:05:53.890> but<00:05:54.130> as<00:05:54.250> a

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 
on it it's like a consumer bike but as a

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.010 
on it it's like a consumer bike but as a
race<00:05:54.490> bike<00:05:54.700> where<00:05:54.850> your<00:05:54.970> turn<00:05:55.240> changing<00:05:55.780> parts

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020 
race bike where your turn changing parts

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:57.980 
race bike where your turn changing parts
all<00:05:56.110> the<00:05:56.140> time<00:05:56.350> like<00:05:56.560> it's<00:05:57.100> probably<00:05:57.310> ideal

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:57.990 
all the time like it's probably ideal

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:03.210 
all the time like it's probably ideal
well<00:05:58.990> I<00:05:59.020> own<00:05:59.290> a<00:05:59.550> 2004<00:06:00.550> two-stroke<00:06:01.270> 250<00:06:01.900> so<00:06:02.860> I'm

have<00:06:07.270> some<00:06:07.450> in<00:06:07.540> Michigan<00:06:07.900> and<00:06:07.990> I<00:06:08.050> have<00:06:08.170> one<00:06:08.320> in

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:08.470 
have some in Michigan and I have one in

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.800 
have some in Michigan and I have one in
California<00:06:08.920> which<00:06:09.070> I've<00:06:09.280> ridden<00:06:09.600> recently<00:06:10.600> so

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:10.810 
California which I've ridden recently so

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.370 
California which I've ridden recently so
I<00:06:11.020> was<00:06:11.520> stoked<00:06:12.520> to<00:06:12.610> try<00:06:12.760> this<00:06:12.820> out<00:06:13.030> because

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:13.380 
I was stoked to try this out because

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.500 
I was stoked to try this out because
honestly<00:06:14.380> you<00:06:14.800> can<00:06:14.980> modify<00:06:15.760> the<00:06:15.940> engine<00:06:16.360> and

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:16.510 
honestly you can modify the engine and

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:18.090 
honestly you can modify the engine and
such<00:06:16.720> and<00:06:16.900> make<00:06:17.020> it<00:06:17.140> pretty<00:06:17.350> fast<00:06:17.560> but<00:06:17.890> that

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:18.100 
such and make it pretty fast but that

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.950 
such and make it pretty fast but that
kind<00:06:18.430> of<00:06:18.490> defeats<00:06:18.700> the<00:06:19.150> purpose<00:06:19.210> so<00:06:19.660> it's<00:06:19.810> cool

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:19.960 
kind of defeats the purpose so it's cool

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.630 
kind of defeats the purpose so it's cool
to<00:06:20.020> see<00:06:20.170> how<00:06:20.440> this<00:06:20.590> thing<00:06:20.770> runs<00:06:20.980> in<00:06:21.100> stock<00:06:21.340> form

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:21.640 
to see how this thing runs in stock form

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.790 
to see how this thing runs in stock form
and<00:06:21.930> obviously<00:06:22.930> it's<00:06:23.110> cool<00:06:23.320> to<00:06:23.440> just<00:06:23.470> try<00:06:23.740> the

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:23.800 
and obviously it's cool to just try the

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.620 
and obviously it's cool to just try the
chassis<00:06:24.220> and<00:06:24.370> get<00:06:24.820> it<00:06:24.970> give<00:06:25.120> the<00:06:25.210> experience

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:25.630 
chassis and get it give the experience

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:27.390 
chassis and get it give the experience
of<00:06:25.690> riding<00:06:25.870> the<00:06:26.170> bike<00:06:26.410> that<00:06:26.680> chicken<00:06:27.190> has<00:06:27.310> so

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:27.400 
of riding the bike that chicken has so

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.550 
of riding the bike that chicken has so
much<00:06:27.520> success<00:06:27.700> on<00:06:27.970> as<00:06:28.690> far<00:06:28.870> as<00:06:28.930> it<00:06:29.290> doing

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:29.560 
much success on as far as it doing

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:30.840 
much success on as far as it doing
anything<00:06:29.890> better<00:06:30.130> than<00:06:30.340> the<00:06:30.520> current

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:30.850 
anything better than the current

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:32.430 
anything better than the current
four-stroke<00:06:31.330> in<00:06:31.450> which<00:06:31.570> I<00:06:31.690> ride<00:06:31.870> I<00:06:31.900> definitely

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:32.440 
four-stroke in which I ride I definitely

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:33.660 
four-stroke in which I ride I definitely
think<00:06:32.560> it<00:06:32.710> brought<00:06:32.860> it<00:06:33.010> definitely<00:06:33.460> turns

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:33.670 
think it brought it definitely turns

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:36.720 
think it brought it definitely turns
better<00:06:34.470> probably<00:06:35.470> due<00:06:36.040> to<00:06:36.070> the<00:06:36.250> fact<00:06:36.280> that<00:06:36.640> it

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:36.730 
better probably due to the fact that it

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:39.300 
better probably due to the fact that it
has<00:06:36.850> zero<00:06:37.000> engine<00:06:37.540> braking<00:06:37.780> and<00:06:38.050> also<00:06:38.470> that<00:06:39.190> it

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:39.310 
has zero engine braking and also that it

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:41.700 
has zero engine braking and also that it
feels<00:06:39.850> really<00:06:40.030> light<00:06:40.300> but<00:06:40.990> honestly<00:06:41.440> it<00:06:41.530> feels

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:41.710 
feels really light but honestly it feels

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:44.460 
feels really light but honestly it feels
really<00:06:42.160> small<00:06:42.400> so<00:06:42.730> I'm<00:06:43.390> gonna<00:06:43.510> feel<00:06:44.290> like<00:06:44.380> if

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:44.470 
really small so I'm gonna feel like if

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:45.720 
really small so I'm gonna feel like if
you<00:06:44.560> push<00:06:44.770> the<00:06:44.920> envelope<00:06:45.310> but<00:06:45.340> there's<00:06:45.670> a

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:45.730 
you push the envelope but there's a

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:53.510 
you push the envelope but there's a
you're<00:06:46.630> probably<00:06:46.810> gonna<00:06:46.990> crash<00:06:47.230> pretty<00:06:47.410> hard

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.520 

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.970 

that's<00:06:54.000> great<00:06:54.210> this<00:06:54.480> is<00:06:54.660> my<00:06:54.810> whole<00:06:55.380> life<00:06:55.410> dream

yeah<00:07:07.440> I<00:07:07.470> mean<00:07:07.890> when<00:07:08.550> Steve<00:07:08.790> told<00:07:09.030> me<00:07:09.180> that<00:07:09.360> he

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:09.570 
yeah I mean when Steve told me that he

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:11.240 
yeah I mean when Steve told me that he
rebuilt<00:07:10.020> it<00:07:10.230> I<00:07:10.410> got<00:07:10.800> a<00:07:10.830> little<00:07:10.980> bit<00:07:11.130> more

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:11.250 
rebuilt it I got a little bit more

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:12.710 
rebuilt it I got a little bit more
confidence<00:07:11.760> when<00:07:11.940> he<00:07:12.060> told<00:07:12.210> me<00:07:12.330> that<00:07:12.390> Berluti

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:12.720 
confidence when he told me that Berluti

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.510 
confidence when he told me that Berluti
helped<00:07:13.050> him<00:07:13.140> with<00:07:13.320> the<00:07:13.410> engine<00:07:13.710> and<00:07:13.800> such<00:07:14.010> so<00:07:14.280> I

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:14.520 
helped him with the engine and such so I

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.100 
helped him with the engine and such so I
figured<00:07:15.000> you<00:07:15.090> know<00:07:15.120> I<00:07:15.450> don't<00:07:15.810> really<00:07:15.930> have<00:07:16.080> a

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:16.110 
figured you know I don't really have a

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:17.300 
figured you know I don't really have a
problem<00:07:16.290> catching<00:07:16.530> air<00:07:16.770> on<00:07:16.890> it<00:07:17.010> if<00:07:17.100> Louie

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:17.310 
problem catching air on it if Louie

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:19.820 
problem catching air on it if Louie
worked<00:07:17.550> on<00:07:17.700> it
