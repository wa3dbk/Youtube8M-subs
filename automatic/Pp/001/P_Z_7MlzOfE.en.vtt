00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
that works good I've got my goody pick

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.889 
that works good I've got my goody pick
which<00:00:34.079> I<00:00:34.350> just<00:00:34.860> love<00:00:35.070> it<00:00:35.219> because<00:00:35.690> my<00:00:36.690> nails

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
which I just love it because my nails

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.770 
which I just love it because my nails
are<00:00:37.050> really<00:00:37.079> long<00:00:37.410> so<00:00:38.160> holding<00:00:38.790> it<00:00:38.940> is<00:00:39.120> very

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
are really long so holding it is very

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.799 
are really long so holding it is very
easy<00:00:40.170> as<00:00:40.469> opposed<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:41.120> the<00:00:42.120> comb<00:00:42.390> I<00:00:42.600> mean<00:00:42.719> the

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
easy as opposed to the comb I mean the

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.470 
easy as opposed to the comb I mean the
comma<00:00:42.989> is<00:00:43.110> okay<00:00:43.350> too<00:00:43.410> but<00:00:44.219> I<00:00:44.340> find<00:00:44.700> using<00:00:45.210> the

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
comma is okay too but I find using the

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.889 
comma is okay too but I find using the
pick<00:00:45.750> is<00:00:46.280> really<00:00:47.280> good<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.730> then<00:00:48.329> this<00:00:48.719> is

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
pick is really good and then this is

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.560 
pick is really good and then this is
just<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.200> little<00:00:49.440> cheapy<00:00:49.950> pick<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:51.030> I<00:00:51.090> picked

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
just a little cheapy pick that I picked

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.850 
just a little cheapy pick that I picked
up<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:52.940> now<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:54.420> doesn't<00:00:54.750> work<00:00:54.870> that<00:00:54.899> good<00:00:55.350> you

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
up and now it doesn't work that good you

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.670 
up and now it doesn't work that good you
would<00:00:56.010> think<00:00:56.219> that<00:00:56.399> all<00:00:56.820> picks<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.960> pick<00:00:58.440> is<00:00:58.620> a

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
would think that all picks a pick is a

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.660 
would think that all picks a pick is a
pick<00:00:59.010> is<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.460> pick<00:00:59.730> and<00:00:59.940> that<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:00.899> not<00:01:01.140> true<00:01:01.670> this

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
pick is a pick and that is not true this

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.969 
pick is a pick and that is not true this
does<00:01:03.000> not<00:01:03.180> work<00:01:03.420> well<00:01:03.690> at<00:01:03.899> all<00:01:03.930> this<00:01:04.769> is<00:01:04.949> a

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
does not work well at all this is a

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.640 
does not work well at all this is a
goody-goody<00:01:05.580> pick<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.810> this<00:01:07.049> is<00:01:07.170> just<00:01:07.350> like<00:01:07.590> a

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
goody-goody pick and this is just like a

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.240 
goody-goody pick and this is just like a
dollar<00:01:07.920> store<00:01:08.040> pick<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:09.470> no<00:01:10.470> this<00:01:10.920> is<00:01:10.979> not

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
dollar store pick and no this is not

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.679 
dollar store pick and no this is not
good<00:01:11.430> this<00:01:11.640> one's<00:01:11.880> actually<00:01:12.090> going<00:01:12.450> in<00:01:12.659> the

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
good this one's actually going in the

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.920 
good this one's actually going in the
garbage<00:01:12.840> it's<00:01:13.650> not<00:01:13.830> good<00:01:14.010> so<00:01:14.220> I<00:01:15.090> actually<00:01:15.420> use

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
garbage it's not good so I actually use

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.370 
garbage it's not good so I actually use
these<00:01:16.380> two<00:01:17.030> the<00:01:18.030> goody<00:01:18.240> pick<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:19.049> is<00:01:19.080> good

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
these two the goody pick and it is good

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.510 
these two the goody pick and it is good
I<00:01:19.560> guess<00:01:19.710> that's<00:01:19.890> why<00:01:19.979> it's<00:01:20.100> called<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.340> goody

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
I guess that's why it's called a goody

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.700 
I guess that's why it's called a goody
because<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.420> is<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.630> really<00:01:22.020> good<00:01:22.229> pick<00:01:22.470> it

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
because it is a really good pick it

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.710 
because it is a really good pick it
detangles<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.549> hair<00:01:23.729> really<00:01:24.000> nicely<00:01:24.210> and

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
detangles the hair really nicely and

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.410 
detangles the hair really nicely and
then<00:01:25.110> this<00:01:25.229> is<00:01:25.380> my<00:01:25.530> why<00:01:25.710> tooth<00:01:25.979> comb<00:01:26.420> which

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
then this is my why tooth comb which

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.840 
then this is my why tooth comb which
maybe<00:01:27.869> it's<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.229> material<00:01:28.799> that<00:01:29.430> they're

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
maybe it's the material that they're

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.800 
maybe it's the material that they're
made<00:01:29.909> out<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.450> I<00:01:30.900> don't<00:01:31.650> know<00:01:31.740> because<00:01:32.520> they're

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
made out of I don't know because they're

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.980 
made out of I don't know because they're
they<00:01:33.810> both<00:01:33.990> feel<00:01:34.200> about<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.530> same<00:01:35.630> yeah<00:01:36.630> I

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
they both feel about the same yeah I

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.330 
they both feel about the same yeah I
think<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.619> other<00:01:37.740> one<00:01:37.860> might<00:01:38.040> be<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.189> little

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
think the other one might be a little

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.760 
think the other one might be a little
more<00:01:38.430> porous<00:01:38.880> so<00:01:39.630> when<00:01:39.900> you're<00:01:40.020> going<00:01:40.380> through

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
more porous so when you're going through

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.130 
more porous so when you're going through
to<00:01:41.009> detangle<00:01:41.340> your<00:01:41.520> hair<00:01:41.700> it's<00:01:42.360> really<00:01:42.659> tough

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
to detangle your hair it's really tough

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.380 
to detangle your hair it's really tough
with<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.470> other<00:01:43.590> pick<00:01:43.860> but<00:01:44.369> these<00:01:44.549> are<00:01:44.850> the

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
with the other pick but these are the

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.569 
with the other pick but these are the
two<00:01:45.540> products<00:01:45.960> that<00:01:46.079> I<00:01:46.110> use<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:47.189> two<00:01:47.340> picks

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
two products that I use the two picks

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.580 
two products that I use the two picks
the<00:01:47.729> white<00:01:47.880> tooth<00:01:48.149> comb<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:49.110> pick<00:01:49.350> and

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
the white tooth comb and the pick and

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.740 
the white tooth comb and the pick and
they<00:01:49.710> both<00:01:49.860> work<00:01:50.100> really<00:01:50.280> good<00:01:50.520> I<00:01:50.729> guess<00:01:51.600> it's

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
they both work really good I guess it's

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:52.910 
they both work really good I guess it's
just<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.960> preference<00:01:52.229> if<00:01:52.560> you're<00:01:52.649> like<00:01:52.770> a

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
just a preference if you're like a

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.380 
just a preference if you're like a
handle<00:01:53.610> or<00:01:55.460> holding<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.549> like<00:01:56.670> that<00:01:56.820> I<00:01:57.090> find

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
handle or holding it like that I find
