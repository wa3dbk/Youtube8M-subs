the boat the only issue you'll run into

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.370 
the boat the only issue you'll run into
is<00:02:47.670> there's<00:02:48.240> more<00:02:48.390> vibration<00:02:48.930> back<00:02:49.140> there

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
is there's more vibration back there

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.990 
is there's more vibration back there
from<00:02:49.890> those<00:02:50.070> pedestals<00:02:50.400> than<00:02:50.730> you<00:02:50.850> would

from those pedestals than you would

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.470 
from those pedestals than you would
imagine

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
imagine

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.449 
imagine
I'll<00:02:51.959> fare<00:02:52.320> about<00:02:52.470> a<00:02:52.500> movement<00:02:53.070> and<00:02:53.220> it<00:02:53.280> makes

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
I'll fare about a movement and it makes

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.220 
I'll fare about a movement and it makes
the<00:02:53.580> bride<00:02:54.180> look<00:02:54.420> a<00:02:54.510> lot<00:02:54.660> rougher<00:02:54.930> than<00:02:55.140> it

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
the bride look a lot rougher than it

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.800 
the bride look a lot rougher than it
actually<00:02:55.650> is<00:02:55.890> for<00:02:56.190> a<00:02:57.150> little<00:02:57.330> bit<00:02:57.450> different

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
actually is for a little bit different

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.840 
actually is for a little bit different
angle<00:02:57.900> sometimes<00:02:58.260> I'll<00:02:58.739> use<00:02:59.040> this<00:02:59.220> mouth<00:02:59.489> talk

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
angle sometimes I'll use this mouth talk

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.000 
angle sometimes I'll use this mouth talk
to<00:03:00.060> sticky<00:03:00.300> mount<00:03:00.540> on<00:03:00.690> the<00:03:00.810> side<00:03:01.050> and<00:03:01.500> simply

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
to sticky mount on the side and simply

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.770 
to sticky mount on the side and simply
looking<00:03:02.280> back<00:03:02.459> at<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:02.850> driver's<00:03:03.239> seat<00:03:03.450> gives

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
looking back at the driver's seat gives

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.390 
looking back at the driver's seat gives
you<00:03:03.870> a<00:03:03.900> good<00:03:04.080> angle<00:03:04.260> to<00:03:04.410> sit<00:03:04.620> there<00:03:04.830> and<00:03:05.070> talk<00:03:05.340> a
