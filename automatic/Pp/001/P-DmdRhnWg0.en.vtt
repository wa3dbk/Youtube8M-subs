00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:18.349 
I start in the same way with two turns

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:20.920 
I start in the same way with two turns
around<00:00:19.070> the<00:00:19.520> standing<00:00:19.880> part<00:00:20.180> of<00:00:20.300> the<00:00:20.419> climbing

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:20.930 
around the standing part of the climbing

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.010 
around the standing part of the climbing
line<00:00:21.110> but<00:00:22.070> this<00:00:22.250> time<00:00:22.579> I'll<00:00:22.880> pass<00:00:23.539> the<00:00:23.840> rope

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:24.020 
line but this time I'll pass the rope

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.560 
line but this time I'll pass the rope
over<00:00:24.560> the<00:00:24.680> bridge<00:00:24.949> and<00:00:25.219> I'm<00:00:25.849> changing

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:26.570 
over the bridge and I'm changing

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:34.500 
over the bridge and I'm changing
direction<00:00:26.779> now<00:00:27.469> as<00:00:27.739> I<00:00:28.070> add<00:00:28.279> two<00:00:28.700> more<00:00:29.000> turns

notice<00:00:35.510> with<00:00:35.690> me<00:00:35.840> now<00:00:36.050> that<00:00:36.879> the<00:00:37.879> bridge

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
notice with me now that the bridge

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.800 
notice with me now that the bridge
enters<00:00:39.350> the<00:00:40.129> press<00:00:40.430> ik<00:00:40.640> on<00:00:40.940> the<00:00:41.180> same<00:00:41.450> side

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:49.399 
the climbing hitch is vertical I would

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:51.910 
the climbing hitch is vertical I would
still<00:00:49.730> choose<00:00:49.760> to<00:00:50.390> use<00:00:50.660> the<00:00:51.320> figure<00:00:51.739> eight

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
still choose to use the figure eight

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
when we want it to so that we can climb

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.980 
when we want it to so that we can climb
and<00:01:36.829> use<00:01:36.950> it<00:01:37.100> for<00:01:37.130> work<00:01:37.429> positioning<00:01:38.060> but<00:01:38.899> at

a prusik hitch here but my system is a

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.279 
a prusik hitch here but my system is a
little<00:01:49.520> different<00:01:49.939> because<00:01:50.329> I've<00:01:50.719> got<00:01:50.899> an<00:01:51.049> eye

pull on the tail with the prusik if we
need<00:02:28.540> to<00:02:28.720> tension<00:02:29.230> up<00:02:29.350> the<00:02:29.500> knot<00:02:29.680> we<00:02:30.190> would<00:02:30.400> use

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
need to tension up the knot we would use

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.410 
need to tension up the knot we would use
the<00:02:31.180> bar<00:02:31.420> and<00:02:31.780> push<00:02:32.170> the<00:02:32.410> bar<00:02:32.620> away<00:02:33.040> from<00:02:33.340> us<00:02:33.460> if

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
the bar and push the bar away from us if

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.470 
the bar and push the bar away from us if
we<00:02:35.410> needed<00:02:35.620> to<00:02:35.710> loosen<00:02:36.460> up<00:02:36.580> the<00:02:36.640> knot<00:02:36.940> so<00:02:37.330> we

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
we needed to loosen up the knot so we

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.080 
we needed to loosen up the knot so we
could<00:02:37.690> slide<00:02:38.110> it<00:02:38.410> down<00:02:38.680> the<00:02:38.740> line<00:02:39.100> I<00:02:39.460> would<00:02:39.790> use

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
could slide it down the line I would use

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.660 
could slide it down the line I would use
my<00:02:40.300> thumb<00:02:40.630> here<00:02:40.900> to<00:02:41.080> break<00:02:41.440> the<00:02:41.740> bar<00:02:41.950> and<00:02:42.220> then

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
my thumb here to break the bar and then

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.790 
my thumb here to break the bar and then
it<00:02:42.880> will<00:02:43.150> slide<00:02:43.450> easier<00:02:44.760> now<00:02:45.760> I<00:02:46.090> can<00:02:46.750> also<00:02:47.020> form

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
it will slide easier now I can also form

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.290 
it will slide easier now I can also form
a<00:02:47.980> closed<00:02:48.580> prusik<00:02:49.450> if<00:02:49.600> I<00:02:50.050> were<00:02:50.200> to<00:02:50.380> utilize<00:02:50.830> a

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
a closed prusik if I were to utilize a

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.410 
a closed prusik if I were to utilize a
endless<00:02:52.300> loop<00:02:52.630> of<00:02:53.010> line<00:02:54.010> like<00:02:54.550> I've<00:02:54.730> got<00:02:54.970> here

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
endless loop of line like I've got here

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.470 
endless loop of line like I've got here
I<00:02:55.570> can<00:02:56.530> just<00:02:56.740> take<00:02:57.280> this<00:02:57.520> and<00:02:57.760> pass<00:02:58.180> it<00:02:58.450> through

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
I can just take this and pass it through

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:05.340 
I can just take this and pass it through
itself<00:02:59.550> once<00:03:01.739> twice<00:03:02.739> and<00:03:03.239> I<00:03:04.239> can<00:03:04.480> dress<00:03:04.840> the

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
itself once twice and I can dress the

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.350 
itself once twice and I can dress the
knot<00:03:05.590> and<00:03:07.440> you<00:03:08.440> can<00:03:08.620> see<00:03:08.890> that<00:03:09.190> these<00:03:09.790> two<00:03:09.850> are

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
knot and you can see that these two are

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.699 
knot and you can see that these two are
very<00:03:10.600> similar

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
very similar

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.880 
very similar
I<00:03:12.420> can<00:03:13.420> sit<00:03:13.959> down<00:03:14.200> into<00:03:14.530> this<00:03:14.709> and<00:03:15.430> again

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
I can sit down into this and again

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.350 
I can sit down into this and again
setting<00:03:17.890> it<00:03:18.010> make<00:03:18.280> sure<00:03:18.310> it'll<00:03:18.640> hold<00:03:18.850> for<00:03:19.000> me

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
setting it make sure it'll hold for me

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.490 
setting it make sure it'll hold for me
it<00:03:20.290> works<00:03:20.590> quite<00:03:20.980> nicely<00:03:22.020> we<00:03:23.020> did<00:03:23.260> talk<00:03:23.440> about

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
it works quite nicely we did talk about

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.410 
it works quite nicely we did talk about
some<00:03:23.950> of<00:03:24.010> the<00:03:24.100> limitations<00:03:24.520> of<00:03:24.910> the<00:03:25.180> prusik

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
some of the limitations of the prusik

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.400 
some of the limitations of the prusik
when<00:03:26.110> only<00:03:26.350> one<00:03:26.680> part<00:03:27.070> of<00:03:27.160> the<00:03:27.250> line<00:03:27.519> is<00:03:27.880> loaded

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
when only one part of the line is loaded

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.949 
when only one part of the line is loaded
even<00:03:29.410> with<00:03:29.799> this<00:03:30.250> system<00:03:30.750> sometimes<00:03:31.750> the

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
even with this system sometimes the

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.280 
even with this system sometimes the
prusik<00:03:32.170> knot<00:03:32.380> can<00:03:32.920> load<00:03:33.190> very<00:03:33.880> tightly<00:03:34.299> and<00:03:34.690> it

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
prusik knot can load very tightly and it

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.949 
prusik knot can load very tightly and it
can<00:03:35.470> be<00:03:35.620> hard<00:03:36.280> to<00:03:36.489> break<00:03:36.850> the<00:03:37.090> knot<00:03:37.299> if<00:03:37.570> I

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
can be hard to break the knot if I

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.740 
can be hard to break the knot if I
wanted<00:03:38.320> to<00:03:38.470> send<00:03:38.799> on<00:03:39.010> it<00:03:39.299> however<00:03:40.299> it<00:03:40.540> is<00:03:40.720> a
