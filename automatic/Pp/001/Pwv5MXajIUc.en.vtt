cutter<00:00:18.470> again<00:00:19.470> same<00:00:20.160> way<00:00:20.369> that<00:00:20.520> I<00:00:20.580> did<00:00:20.699> with

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
cutter again same way that I did with

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.420 
cutter again same way that I did with
the<00:00:22.199> phyllo<00:00:22.949> pastry<00:00:23.070> except<00:00:23.880> this<00:00:24.029> time

the phyllo pastry except this time

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:32.049 
the phyllo pastry except this time
different<00:00:26.430> shape<00:00:29.660> I've<00:00:30.660> read<00:00:30.929> in<00:00:31.050> magazines

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
different shape I've read in magazines

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:35.900 
different shape I've read in magazines
places<00:00:33.059> where<00:00:33.210> they<00:00:33.360> say<00:00:33.680> you<00:00:34.680> know<00:00:34.880> use<00:00:35.880> a

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
places where they say you know use a

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.680 
places where they say you know use a
ruler<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:40.730> make<00:00:41.730> sure<00:00:41.969> that<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.270> lines<00:00:42.480> are

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
ruler to make sure that the lines are

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.319 
ruler to make sure that the lines are
absolutely<00:00:43.350> even<00:00:44.219> but<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:44.820> know<00:00:44.940> what<00:00:45.149> it

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
absolutely even but you know what it

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.760 
absolutely even but you know what it
doesn't<00:00:45.360> really<00:00:45.899> matter<00:00:46.170> all<00:00:46.440> that<00:00:46.469> much

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
doesn't really matter all that much

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.229 
doesn't really matter all that much
because<00:00:46.980> you're<00:00:47.160> going<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.399> end<00:00:47.579> up<00:00:47.700> twisting

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
because you're going to end up twisting

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.799 
because you're going to end up twisting
it<00:00:48.950> onto<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.300> sheet<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.449> you'll<00:00:51.539> see<00:00:51.719> it

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
it onto the sheet and you'll see it

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.060 
it onto the sheet and you'll see it
becomes<00:00:52.140> quite<00:00:52.410> beautiful<00:00:53.059> and<00:00:54.320> so<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.860> fact

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
becomes quite beautiful and so the fact

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:03.920 
becomes quite beautiful and so the fact
that<00:00:56.190> it's<00:00:56.399> precisely<00:01:01.399> each<00:01:02.399> one<00:01:02.670> is<00:01:02.930> whatever

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
that it's precisely each one is whatever

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.340 
that it's precisely each one is whatever
three-quarters<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:04.890> an<00:01:05.070> inch<00:01:05.570> or<00:01:06.570> so<00:01:06.600> doesn't

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
three-quarters of an inch or so doesn't

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.020 
three-quarters of an inch or so doesn't
really<00:01:07.409> matter<00:01:07.560> now<00:01:07.950> this<00:01:08.400> is<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.549> great<00:01:08.820> tool

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
really matter now this is a great tool

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.890 
really matter now this is a great tool

straw in midair stretch it a little bit

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.289 
straw in midair stretch it a little bit
and<00:01:24.830> deposit<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:25.890> gently<00:01:26.310> on<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.640> cookie

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
and deposit it gently on the cookie

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.630 
and deposit it gently on the cookie
sheet<00:01:28.250> then<00:01:29.250> our<00:01:29.460> next<00:01:29.520> strip<00:01:31.250> you<00:01:32.250> can<00:01:32.430> see

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
sheet then our next strip you can see

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.249 
sheet then our next strip you can see
it's<00:01:32.790> already<00:01:33.000> sort<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.689> it's<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:36.049> like<00:01:37.049> any

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
it's already sort of it's a like any

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.039 
it's already sort of it's a like any
dough<00:01:37.500> it's<00:01:37.740> quite<00:01:38.009> delicate<00:01:38.490> so<00:01:39.150> you

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
dough it's quite delicate so you

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.600 
dough it's quite delicate so you
wouldn't<00:01:40.170> want<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.560> wanted<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.100> roll<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:41.520> out

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
wouldn't want to wanted to roll it out

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.039 
wouldn't want to wanted to roll it out
much<00:01:41.850> more<00:01:42.150> than<00:01:42.329> that<00:01:42.450> because<00:01:42.720> then<00:01:42.960> it

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
much more than that because then it

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.460 
much more than that because then it
would<00:01:43.170> get<00:01:43.320> thin<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:44.040> break<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:45.290> that<00:01:46.290> would

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
would get thin and break and that would

00:01:46.470 --> 00:02:02.020 
would get thin and break and that would
just<00:01:47.600> not<00:01:48.600> be<00:01:48.630> good

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.640 

and<00:02:02.240> cut<00:02:03.080> if<00:02:03.409> you<00:02:03.590> want<00:02:03.770> to<00:02:03.860> get<00:02:04.040> some<00:02:05.650> that's

more<00:02:36.410> than<00:02:36.530> 15<00:02:36.950> minutes<00:02:37.100> because<00:02:37.400> they'll

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
more than 15 minutes because they'll

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.420 
more than 15 minutes because they'll
