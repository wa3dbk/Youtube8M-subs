you're allowed to have it you're allowed
to<00:01:08.369> collect<00:01:08.760> it<00:01:09.439> you<00:01:10.439> know<00:01:10.560> it's<00:01:10.710> one<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:10.890> those

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
to collect it you know it's one of those

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.039 
to collect it you know it's one of those
paradoxical<00:01:11.939> situations<00:01:12.630> where<00:01:12.900> you're

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
paradoxical situations where you're

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.830 
paradoxical situations where you're
perfectly<00:01:13.560> allowed<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:14.010> have<00:01:14.220> it

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
perfectly allowed to have it

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.359 
perfectly allowed to have it
but<00:01:15.840> if<00:01:15.990> you're<00:01:16.140> found<00:01:16.409> like<00:01:16.740> lurking<00:01:17.250> around

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
but if you're found like lurking around

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.039 
but if you're found like lurking around
with<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.900> design<00:01:19.350> will<00:01:19.590> work<00:01:19.619> against<00:01:20.340> you

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
with it the design will work against you

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:23.690 
with it the design will work against you
so<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:22.080> just<00:01:22.350> keep<00:01:22.530> them<00:01:22.710> locked<00:01:22.979> up<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.580> know

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
so I just keep them locked up you know

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.899 
so I just keep them locked up you know
locked<00:01:24.450> up<00:01:24.689> in<00:01:24.840> my<00:01:24.990> collection<00:01:25.710> but<00:01:25.920> this<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:26.880> a

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
locked up in my collection but this is a

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.440 
locked up in my collection but this is a
fairly<00:01:27.299> interesting<00:01:27.780> piece<00:01:28.320> I<00:01:29.150> got<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.360> at

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
fairly interesting piece I got it at

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.530 
fairly interesting piece I got it at
Wild<00:01:30.840> Bill<00:01:31.049> wholesale<00:01:31.790> love<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.970> looks<00:01:33.210> of<00:01:33.390> it

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
Wild Bill wholesale love the looks of it

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.960 
Wild Bill wholesale love the looks of it
they<00:01:34.500> did<00:01:34.710> have<00:01:34.890> one<00:01:35.130> with<00:01:35.310> bone<00:01:35.610> handle

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
they did have one with bone handle

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.190 
they did have one with bone handle
scales<00:01:36.479> but<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.710> one<00:01:37.920> sold<00:01:38.250> out<00:01:38.400> right<00:01:38.700> away

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
scales but that one sold out right away

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.899 
scales but that one sold out right away
alright<00:01:40.200> but<00:01:40.380> this<00:01:40.530> one's<00:01:40.740> pretty<00:01:40.890> cool<00:01:41.310> too<00:01:41.610> I

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
alright but this one's pretty cool too I

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.230 
alright but this one's pretty cool too I
don't<00:01:42.630> know<00:01:42.720> if<00:01:42.780> they<00:01:42.899> still<00:01:42.960> have<00:01:43.200> these<00:01:44.240> the

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
don't know if they still have these the

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.139 
don't know if they still have these the
design<00:01:45.600> problem<00:01:46.140> with<00:01:46.320> this<00:01:46.530> is<00:01:46.860> actually<00:01:47.490> the

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
design problem with this is actually the

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.469 
design problem with this is actually the
same<00:01:48.390> problem<00:01:48.840> is<00:01:48.990> with<00:01:49.170> many<00:01:49.409> push<00:01:49.680> daggers

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
same problem is with many push daggers

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.550 
same problem is with many push daggers
namely<00:01:51.479> that<00:01:52.110> this<00:01:52.320> part<00:01:52.619> is<00:01:52.710> too<00:01:52.950> wide

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
namely that this part is too wide

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.810 
namely that this part is too wide
anatomically<00:01:55.560> when<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.219> make<00:01:56.399> a<00:01:56.430> fist

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
anatomically when you make a fist

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.969 
anatomically when you make a fist
there's<00:01:57.719> not<00:01:57.930> much<00:01:58.170> room<00:01:58.439> between<00:01:58.680> the

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
there's not much room between the

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.330 
there's not much room between the
fingers<00:01:59.430> you<00:02:00.420> see<00:02:00.630> that<00:02:01.159> sorry<00:02:02.159> for<00:02:02.280> the

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
fingers you see that sorry for the

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.569 
fingers you see that sorry for the
background<00:02:02.759> noise<00:02:02.880> but<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:03.719> see<00:02:03.930> that<00:02:04.579> right

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
background noise but you see that right

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.520 
background noise but you see that right
so<00:02:05.820> this<00:02:06.000> artificially<00:02:06.780> spreads<00:02:07.140> out<00:02:07.320> your

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
so this artificially spreads out your

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.690 
so this artificially spreads out your
fingers<00:02:07.979> making<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.239> weaker<00:02:09.920> alright<00:02:10.920> so<00:02:11.190> you

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
fingers making it weaker alright so you

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.760 
fingers making it weaker alright so you
know<00:02:11.730> if<00:02:11.970> I<00:02:12.090> designed<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.569> real<00:02:12.780> push<00:02:13.290> dagger

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
know if I designed a real push dagger

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.180 
know if I designed a real push dagger
this<00:02:14.370> part<00:02:14.670> would<00:02:14.790> be<00:02:14.850> slim<00:02:15.920> but<00:02:16.920> I<00:02:16.950> don't

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
this part would be slim but I don't

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.790 
this part would be slim but I don't
really<00:02:17.400> care<00:02:17.670> because<00:02:18.350> you<00:02:19.350> know<00:02:19.470> it's<00:02:19.650> not

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
really care because you know it's not

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.270 
really care because you know it's not
for<00:02:20.130> use<00:02:20.370> it<00:02:20.850> could<00:02:21.090> still<00:02:21.360> cause<00:02:21.570> grievous

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
for use it could still cause grievous

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.680 
for use it could still cause grievous
grievous<00:02:23.280> damage<00:02:23.790> it's<00:02:24.000> just<00:02:24.240> it's<00:02:24.510> not

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
grievous damage it's just it's not

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.880 
grievous damage it's just it's not
optimized<00:02:25.410> but<00:02:25.850> still<00:02:26.850> quite<00:02:27.240> effective<00:02:27.990> and

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
optimized but still quite effective and

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.780 
optimized but still quite effective and

strike<00:02:41.330> you<00:02:42.330> have<00:02:42.540> you<00:02:43.470> know<00:02:43.590> you<00:02:43.650> have<00:02:43.830> a

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
strike you have you know you have a

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.690 
strike you have you know you have a
dagger<00:02:44.400> so<00:02:44.880> you<00:02:44.940> don't<00:02:45.210> need<00:02:45.600> as<00:02:46.310> much<00:02:47.310> power

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700

dagger so you don't need as much power
to<00:02:48.270> cause<00:02:48.510> damage<00:02:49.040> and<00:02:50.040> so<00:02:50.310> that<00:02:50.490> pretty<00:02:50.760> much

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
to cause damage and so that pretty much

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.250 
to cause damage and so that pretty much
pretty<00:02:51.810> much<00:02:52.080> you<00:02:53.070> would<00:02:53.220> use<00:02:53.400> jabs<00:02:54.260> right

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
pretty much you would use jabs right

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.030 
pretty much you would use jabs right
because<00:02:55.470> that<00:02:55.670> fastest<00:02:56.670> punch<00:02:56.910> longest<00:02:57.480> range

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040

because that fastest punch longest range
the<00:02:59.040> hooks<00:02:59.250> and<00:02:59.430> the<00:02:59.520> uppercuts<00:03:00.030> would<00:03:00.240> only

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
the hooks and the uppercuts would only

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.300 
the hooks and the uppercuts would only
come<00:03:00.720> in<00:03:01.310> if<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.580> range<00:03:02.820> closes<00:03:03.630> and<00:03:03.960> you<00:03:04.310> find

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
come in if the range closes and you find

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.780 
come in if the range closes and you find
yourself<00:03:05.430> and<00:03:06.000> uh<00:03:06.440> you<00:03:07.440> know<00:03:07.650> bad<00:03:08.430> breath

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
yourself and uh you know bad breath

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.540 
yourself and uh you know bad breath
range<00:03:09.380> there's<00:03:10.380> also<00:03:10.620> a<00:03:10.770> way<00:03:11.010> to<00:03:11.040> use<00:03:11.340> these

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
range there's also a way to use these

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.700 
range there's also a way to use these
without<00:03:11.760> strikes<00:03:12.360> like<00:03:13.020> you<00:03:13.200> don't<00:03:13.350> have<00:03:13.530> to

have not been covered all that well just

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.730
