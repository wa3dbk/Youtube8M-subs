piggies montine Stanley down in the

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.160 
piggies montine Stanley down in the
bottom<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.199> I've<00:00:17.039> got<00:00:17.250> badger<00:00:17.550> and<00:00:18.060> Gibson<00:00:18.930> at

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
bottom and I've got badger and Gibson at

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.590 
bottom and I've got badger and Gibson at
the<00:00:19.230> top<00:00:19.550> so<00:00:20.550> just<00:00:21.000> starting<00:00:21.300> on<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.480> first

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
the top so just starting on the first

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.070 
the top so just starting on the first
point<00:00:22.279> really<00:00:23.279> important<00:00:23.820> that<00:00:24.630> you<00:00:24.750> revise

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
point really important that you revise

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.140 
point really important that you revise
your<00:00:25.590> guinea<00:00:25.830> pig<00:00:25.920> with<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.310> largest<00:00:26.880> cage

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
your guinea pig with the largest cage

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.929 
your guinea pig with the largest cage
that<00:00:27.390> you<00:00:27.510> possibly<00:00:27.750> can<00:00:28.550> really<00:00:29.550> important

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
that you possibly can really important

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.609 
that you possibly can really important
depending<00:00:30.150> on<00:00:30.420> how<00:00:30.570> many<00:00:30.630> piggies<00:00:31.199> you<00:00:31.349> have

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
depending on how many piggies you have

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.190 
depending on how many piggies you have
and<00:00:31.980> I<00:00:32.730> would<00:00:33.210> always<00:00:33.420> say<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.809> bigger<00:00:34.020> the

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
and I would always say the bigger the

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.709 
and I would always say the bigger the
better<00:00:34.399> so<00:00:35.399> my<00:00:36.000> two<00:00:36.059> cages<00:00:36.719> are<00:00:37.219> two<00:00:38.219> by<00:00:38.460> five

00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719 
better so my two cages are two by five

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:41.780 
better so my two cages are two by five
grids<00:00:39.719> for<00:00:40.290> cnc<00:00:40.710> cage<00:00:40.980> so<00:00:41.280> they've<00:00:41.460> got<00:00:41.579> plenty

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
grids for cnc cage so they've got plenty

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.619 
grids for cnc cage so they've got plenty
of<00:00:42.059> room<00:00:42.379> to<00:00:43.379> move<00:00:43.410> around<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.160> exercise

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
of room to move around and to exercise

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:47.299 
of room to move around and to exercise
so<00:00:45.629> really<00:00:45.989> important<00:00:46.500> that's<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.829> number

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
so really important that's the number

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.400 
so really important that's the number
one<00:00:47.489> basic<00:00:48.480> principle<00:00:48.960> when<00:00:49.140> you<00:00:49.230> have<00:00:49.379> a

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
one basic principle when you have a

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.920 
one basic principle when you have a
guinea<00:00:49.649> pig<00:00:49.739> is<00:00:50.190> give<00:00:50.910> them<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.270> biggest

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
guinea pig is give them the biggest

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.939 
guinea pig is give them the biggest
amount<00:00:52.140> of<00:00:52.289> space<00:00:52.559> that<00:00:52.620> you<00:00:52.949> physically<00:00:53.489> can

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
amount of space that you physically can

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:57.799 
amount of space that you physically can
the<00:00:55.949> bigger<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.340> better<00:00:56.430> like<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:56.910> said<00:00:57.120> I'm

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
the bigger the better like I said I'm

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.080 
the bigger the better like I said I'm
supposed<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.289> keep<00:00:58.500> your<00:00:59.129> guinea<00:00:59.309> pigs<00:00:59.550> inside

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
supposed to keep your guinea pigs inside

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.700 
supposed to keep your guinea pigs inside
I<00:01:00.420> wouldn't<00:01:00.660> recommend<00:01:01.020> keeping<00:01:01.440> them

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
I wouldn't recommend keeping them

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.910 
I wouldn't recommend keeping them
outside<00:01:02.190> as<00:01:02.550> they<00:01:02.879> have<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.180> rare<00:01:03.510> limited

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
outside as they have a rare limited

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.950 
outside as they have a rare limited
temperature<00:01:04.920> tolerance<00:01:05.630> and<00:01:06.630> it's<00:01:06.810> just

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
temperature tolerance and it's just

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:07.940 
temperature tolerance and it's just
better<00:01:07.110> having<00:01:07.380> them<00:01:07.560> inside<00:01:07.830> as<00:01:07.920> well

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
better having them inside as well

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.440 
better having them inside as well
because<00:01:08.220> you<00:01:08.310> can<00:01:08.490> just<00:01:08.520> interact<00:01:09.090> with<00:01:09.299> them

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
because you can just interact with them

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.390 
because you can just interact with them
more<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:09.990> they<00:01:10.590> get<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.860> know<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:11.070> better

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
more and they get to know you better

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.340 
more and they get to know you better
your<00:01:11.939> smells<00:01:12.299> always<00:01:12.750> around<00:01:13.020> them<00:01:13.320> so

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
your smells always around them so

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.870 
your smells always around them so
they're<00:01:13.830> gonna<00:01:13.920> be<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.070> lot<00:01:14.189> more<00:01:14.220> confident

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
they're gonna be a lot more confident

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.300 
they're gonna be a lot more confident
and<00:01:15.000> friendly<00:01:15.450> with<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:16.310> wouldn't

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
and friendly with you and wouldn't

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.770 
and friendly with you and wouldn't
recommend<00:01:17.729> keeping<00:01:17.850> them<00:01:18.060> outside<00:01:18.420> like<00:01:18.659> I

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
recommend keeping them outside like I

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.510 
recommend keeping them outside like I
said<00:01:19.020> as<00:01:19.259> as<00:01:19.470> predators<00:01:19.979> outside<00:01:20.340> and

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
said as as predators outside and

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.370 
said as as predators outside and
obviously<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.000> temperature<00:01:21.479> as<00:01:21.630> well<00:01:21.659> and

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
obviously the temperature as well and

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.870 
obviously the temperature as well and
also<00:01:22.619> wouldn't<00:01:23.009> recommend<00:01:23.400> keeping<00:01:23.520> them<00:01:23.790> in

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
also wouldn't recommend keeping them in

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.240 
also wouldn't recommend keeping them in
a<00:01:23.909> garage<00:01:24.180> because<00:01:25.020> of<00:01:25.200> car<00:01:25.409> fumes<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:26.070> they

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
a garage because of car fumes and they

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.740 
a garage because of car fumes and they
can<00:01:26.369> get<00:01:26.520> very<00:01:26.670> hot<00:01:26.970> in<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.270> summer<00:01:27.540> as<00:01:27.720> well

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
can get very hot in the summer as well

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.090 
can get very hot in the summer as well
so<00:01:28.439> it's<00:01:29.310> better<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.790> keep<00:01:29.970> them<00:01:30.180> inside<00:01:31.100> nice

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
so it's better to keep them inside nice

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.760 
so it's better to keep them inside nice
big<00:01:32.369> cage<00:01:32.640> inside<00:01:33.000> way<00:01:33.990> can<00:01:34.200> interact<00:01:34.590> with

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
big cage inside way can interact with

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.950 
big cage inside way can interact with
them<00:01:34.979> with<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.280> nice<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.790> warm<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.270> safe<00:01:36.540> and

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
them with a nice and warm and safe and

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.140 
them with a nice and warm and safe and
they<00:01:37.770> really<00:01:37.979> will<00:01:38.100> benefit<00:01:38.549> from<00:01:38.579> it<00:01:38.939> and

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
they really will benefit from it and

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.319 
they really will benefit from it and
here's<00:01:39.750> Gibson<00:01:40.140> I<00:01:40.700> might<00:01:41.700> also<00:01:41.729> recommend

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
here's Gibson I might also recommend

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.139 
here's Gibson I might also recommend
keeping<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.869> cage<00:01:43.350> in<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.799> good<00:01:44.340> location<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:45.119> a

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
keeping the cage in a good location to a

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.940 
keeping the cage in a good location to a
place<00:01:45.450> where<00:01:45.750> you're<00:01:45.990> going<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.619> be<00:01:46.710> around

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
place where you're going to be around

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.010 
place where you're going to be around
most<00:01:47.189> of<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.430> time<00:01:47.640> so<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:47.939> frequent<00:01:48.720> several

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
most of the time so you frequent several

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.899 
most of the time so you frequent several
times<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.380> day<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.920> for<00:01:50.369> like<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.520> living<00:01:50.790> room

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
times a day and for like a living room
