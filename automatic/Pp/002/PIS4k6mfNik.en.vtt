00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
try to jump straight onto the grips and

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.730 
try to jump straight onto the grips and
the<00:01:21.420> way<00:01:21.540> I<00:01:21.570> learned<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.050> was<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.380> hold<00:01:22.590> on<00:01:22.710> the

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
then you just stand straight up yeah I

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.639 
then you just stand straight up yeah I
like<00:01:27.030> that<00:01:27.060> take<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.360> deep<00:01:27.600> breath<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.170> then

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:28.649 
like that take a deep breath and then

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
totally exhale before I jump because it

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.200 
totally exhale before I jump because it
leaves<00:01:31.950> more<00:01:32.160> room<00:01:32.220> for<00:01:32.580> flexibility<00:01:33.149> a
