myself<00:01:27.560> you<00:01:28.560> just<00:01:28.799> want<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.420> click<00:01:30.420> because<00:01:30.780> I

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
myself you just want to click because I

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.330 
myself you just want to click because I
think<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.229> have<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.380> different<00:01:31.560> way<00:01:31.829> of<00:01:31.860> caring

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
think I have a different way of caring

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.200 
think I have a different way of caring
because<00:01:33.299> sometimes<00:01:33.689> my<00:01:33.810> hair's<00:01:34.049> not<00:01:34.259> always<00:01:34.680> a

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
because sometimes my hair's not always a

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.569 
because sometimes my hair's not always a
freshly<00:01:36.210> clean<00:01:36.479> so<00:01:37.409> I<00:01:37.439> just<00:01:37.860> wrap<00:01:38.189> it<00:01:38.460> around

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
freshly clean so I just wrap it around

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.999 
freshly clean so I just wrap it around
like<00:01:39.270> as<00:01:39.479> if<00:01:39.750> this<00:01:39.990> is<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.229> kind<00:01:40.470> of<00:01:40.530> guide<00:01:40.740> what

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
like as if this is a kind of guide what

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.700 
like as if this is a kind of guide what
I<00:01:41.040> know<00:01:41.130> it's<00:01:41.340> not<00:01:41.750> like<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:43.079> then<00:01:43.380> I<00:01:43.500> just

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
I know it's not like that then I just

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.440 
I know it's not like that then I just
wrap<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:43.920> around<00:01:46.549> so<00:01:47.549> you<00:01:47.640> just<00:01:47.970> want<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.210> count

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
wrap it around so you just want to count

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.620 
wrap it around so you just want to count
apart<00:01:48.780> once<00:01:52.100> and<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.369> may<00:01:53.520> get<00:01:53.579> lucky<00:01:53.909> if<00:01:54.390> you

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
apart once and you may get lucky if you

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.780 
apart once and you may get lucky if you
know<00:01:54.780> your<00:01:54.960> hair<00:01:55.140> was<00:01:55.320> tight<00:01:55.560> leaked<00:01:55.770> out<00:01:56.009> the

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
know your hair was tight leaked out the

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.929 
know your hair was tight leaked out the
previous<00:01:57.329> day<00:01:57.920> then<00:01:58.920> you<00:01:59.100> end<00:01:59.430> up<00:01:59.610> with<00:01:59.820> the

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
previous day then you end up with the

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.340 
previous day then you end up with the
noose<00:02:00.149> cows<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:00.689> you<00:02:00.780> don't<00:02:00.960> have<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.200> do

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
noose cows that you don't have to do

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.499 
noose cows that you don't have to do
much<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:03.799> then<00:02:04.799> we<00:02:05.640> get<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.030> front<00:02:06.210> and

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
much to then we get to the front and

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.779 
much to then we get to the front and
just<00:02:06.740> when<00:02:07.740> you<00:02:07.890> think<00:02:08.069> this<00:02:08.280> through<00:02:08.610> it

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
just when you think this through it

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.240 
just when you think this through it
because<00:02:09.360> we<00:02:09.450> don't<00:02:09.569> want<00:02:09.810> these<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:10.050> be<00:02:10.250> cows

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
because we don't want these to be cows

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.280 
because we don't want these to be cows
because<00:02:11.819> you<00:02:12.000> look<00:02:12.180> silly
