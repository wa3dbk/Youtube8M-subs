this<00:00:00.719> is<00:00:00.930> the<00:00:01.050> crucial<00:00:01.290> fast<00:00:01.740> from<00:00:02.040> Gerber<00:00:02.399> and

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:02.750 
this is the crucial fast from Gerber and

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:04.880 
this is the crucial fast from Gerber and
2009<00:00:03.750> Gerber<00:00:04.110> came<00:00:04.290> out<00:00:04.410> with<00:00:04.500> the<00:00:04.620> first

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
2009 Gerber came out with the first

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.340 
2009 Gerber came out with the first
crucial<00:00:05.160> and<00:00:05.460> was<00:00:05.700> a<00:00:05.730> big<00:00:06.029> hit<00:00:06.299> this<00:00:07.080> year

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
crucial and was a big hit this year

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.129 
crucial and was a big hit this year
Gerber<00:00:07.770> has<00:00:07.919> improved<00:00:08.309> upon<00:00:08.610> it<00:00:08.820> they<00:00:09.780> made<00:00:09.990> it

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
Gerber has improved upon it they made it

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.940 
Gerber has improved upon it they made it
a<00:00:10.230> fast<00:00:11.360> forward<00:00:12.360> action<00:00:12.630> spring<00:00:13.200> technology

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
a fast forward action spring technology

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.480 
a fast forward action spring technology
a<00:00:15.230> multi-tool<00:00:16.230> so<00:00:16.650> if<00:00:16.770> you<00:00:16.890> only<00:00:17.100> have<00:00:17.279> one

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
a multi-tool so if you only have one

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.609 
a multi-tool so if you only have one
hand<00:00:17.699> available<00:00:17.840> you<00:00:18.840> can<00:00:18.990> still<00:00:19.230> open<00:00:19.380> the

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
hand available you can still open the

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.950 
hand available you can still open the
blade<00:00:20.060> what's<00:00:21.060> really<00:00:21.420> nice<00:00:21.539> about<00:00:21.600> the

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
blade what's really nice about the

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.230 
blade what's really nice about the
crucial<00:00:22.380> that<00:00:22.859> all<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.369> tools<00:00:23.550> on<00:00:23.910> it<00:00:23.939> are

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
crucial that all the tools on it are

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.880 
crucial that all the tools on it are
outward<00:00:24.750> facing<00:00:24.990> you<00:00:25.410> don't<00:00:25.590> have<00:00:25.769> to

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
outward facing you don't have to

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.150 
outward facing you don't have to
butterfly<00:00:26.340> it<00:00:28.760> over<00:00:29.760> here<00:00:30.590> we<00:00:31.590> have<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.769> chisel

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
butterfly it over here we have a chisel

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.650 
butterfly it over here we have a chisel
head<00:00:32.719> all<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:34.320> tools<00:00:34.559> have<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.829> lock<00:00:35.130> on<00:00:35.340> them

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
head all the tools have a lock on them

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:42.319 
head all the tools have a lock on them
so<00:00:36.660> can't<00:00:36.960> closed<00:00:39.620> see<00:00:40.620> that<00:00:41.000> so<00:00:42.000> that's<00:00:42.120> the

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
so can't closed see that so that's the

knife<00:00:56.510> is<00:00:56.720> a<00:00:56.900> part<00:00:57.620> I<00:00:57.710> should<00:00:57.740> say<00:00:58.040> the

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
knife is a part I should say the

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:05.200 
knife is a part I should say the
multiplier<00:00:58.760> is<00:00:58.790> a<00:00:59.740> butterfly<00:01:00.910> opening<00:01:04.210> it's

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
multiplier is a butterfly opening it's

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.610 
multiplier is a butterfly opening it's
fairly<00:01:05.480> decent<00:01:06.020> one<00:01:06.530> hand<00:01:08.290> take<00:01:09.290> a<00:01:09.350> look<00:01:09.530> at

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:09.620 
fairly decent one hand take a look at

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:21.050 
fairly decent one hand take a look at
the<00:01:09.710> head<00:01:12.160> suppliers<00:01:13.570> with<00:01:14.570> a<00:01:14.600> wire<00:01:14.870> cutter

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.010 

it's<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.630> really<00:01:22.020> nice<00:01:22.200> tool<00:01:23.660> again<00:01:24.660> let's<00:01:24.870> take

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
it's a really nice tool again let's take

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.670 
it's a really nice tool again let's take
a<00:01:25.080> look<00:01:25.320> at<00:01:25.410> that<00:01:25.560> fast<00:01:25.860> technology<00:01:26.220> closer<00:01:26.670> up

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.540 

here<00:01:31.680> we<00:01:31.860> have<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.310> safety<00:01:34.130> put<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.340> red

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
here we have the safety put it the red

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:42.050 
here we have the safety put it the red
which<00:01:35.910> means<00:01:36.150> fire<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:37.080> flick<00:01:37.920> away<00:01:41.030> taking<00:01:42.030> a

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
which means fire and flick away taking a

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.190 
which means fire and flick away taking a
look<00:01:42.210> at<00:01:42.300> the<00:01:42.360> construction<00:01:44.690> that<00:01:45.690> we<00:01:45.900> on<00:01:46.050> this

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
look at the construction that we on this

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.640 
look at the construction that we on this
side<00:01:46.440> we<00:01:46.560> have<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.710> g10<00:01:47.520> scaling<00:01:48.060> which<00:01:48.810> is<00:01:49.050> agar

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 
side we have a g10 scaling which is agar

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.260 
side we have a g10 scaling which is agar
which<00:01:50.010> is<00:01:50.160> ten<00:01:50.369> times<00:01:50.520> stronger<00:01:51.030> than
