00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160
 hi friends we are with you i am stopping you 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.710
 some kind of round hole you say that 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:10.440
 happens where is where is square and where is entered 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.799
 where did you make our minecraft here square 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.650
 calm down trees square but measure 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.820
 will now generate quite 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.560
 such cool 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.900
 interesting and just fucking now 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.320
 landscape not fight 2 generated seen 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.869
 KZT Rubik cube Rubik cube's fact 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:35.010
 all more or less smoothed of course not 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:37.800
 perfect but there is no hyperrealism but 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.590
 it's better than it was like for me to 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.690
 maynkravt square game is her style 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.300
 but still in every game we want 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.309
 some share of realism omit it will be 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.890
 and maynkrafte seen this generation and 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.410
 now let's talk about the features 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.660
 small if we take a look 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.399
 let's say a stone here and try it 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.579
 put on the ground thats going to happen 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.410
 something rather strange and squares 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.049
 such as blocked 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.229
 precisely blocks such natural 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:10.409
 origin of cobble stone and they 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:14.040
 we will have quite strange risks 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.820
 that is, a house of earth or of ordinary 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.220
 baker and tweak no longer able 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:23.280
 you ask god andrew how on 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:27.780
 generally build a house and we will have a house 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:30.780
 build a coat of arms only from wood explain 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.009
 because the tree has not undergone any 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.049
 changes 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.259
 it's really good friends because 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:40.140
 how about opening a stone house you 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.340
 pretty nontrivial word task 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.189
 if we put blocks 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.290
 tree then you see that landscape raise 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.210
 changes and it becomes more say 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.940
 So 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:53.680
 smoother something here and it really is 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:56.240
 really cool friends here 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.909
 ask you what will happen if we start 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.130
 dig this beauty will change yes and again 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:04.820
 there will be square mines and I will answer you 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:07.060
 what nifiga now to hollow mine you 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.590
 really feel real 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.290
 miner it will look about 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:16.209
 so that's actually pretty 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.660
 also scary then i used to know that 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.450
 so to speak 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.060
 contribution of 4 squares and I moved along them 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.340
 now it's not 4 squares it 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.800
 Now here is such a smooth 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:31.220
 let's finish the surface now 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.060
 try to test in the new generation 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.760
 such a thing as 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.730
 put it on the word you will see that too 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:42.440
 has not changed any see 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:45.890
 what happens explodes too as you 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:49.610
 see everything very beautiful and zombie baby 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:53.000
 attacks us but now we talk 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:55.430
 not about this all caves and the whole world 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.310
 minecraft will only be generated in 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.680
 this style you do not know what the hell he 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:05.000
 my hell has not changed he 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.709
 stayed the way it is here but ours 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.709
 Maincraft is our favorite merker 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:12.769
 generated sunburn goes smooth 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:15.650
 the edges are cool yes there are bugs need grass 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:18.140
 growing in the air but in fact it 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.360
 it's little things and it's just 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.260
 cosmetic such problems but even 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.450
 water you see how 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.299
 i leads a little bit differently here and 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.579
 principle on this i have all my friends here 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:30.959
 I found you such a cool mod 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:33.450
