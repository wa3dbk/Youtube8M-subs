00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
as you can see he's planting wheat we

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.750 
as you can see he's planting wheat we
are<00:00:28.170> speeding<00:00:28.560> up<00:00:28.680> this<00:00:28.830> process<00:00:29.130> here<00:00:29.609> and

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
are speeding up this process here and

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.030 
are speeding up this process here and
he's<00:00:30.240> harvesting<00:00:30.539> it<00:00:30.960> as<00:00:31.109> well<00:00:31.349> because<00:00:31.769> he's

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
he's harvesting it as well because he's

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.709 
he's harvesting it as well because he's
one<00:00:32.250> of<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.489> farmer<00:00:32.820> types<00:00:33.059> when<00:00:33.510> he's

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
one of the farmer types when he's

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.229 
one of the farmer types when he's
harvesting<00:00:34.020> them<00:00:34.590> this<00:00:35.100> gets<00:00:35.399> sorted<00:00:35.670> here

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
harvesting them this gets sorted here

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.590 
harvesting them this gets sorted here
and<00:00:36.510> he<00:00:36.989> gets<00:00:37.290> given<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.460> seats<00:00:38.730> back<00:00:39.120> so<00:00:39.450> he

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
and he gets given the seats back so he

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.979 
and he gets given the seats back so he
can<00:00:39.809> continue<00:00:40.489> planting<00:00:41.489> them<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:42.000> basically

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
can continue planting them and basically

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.990 
can continue planting them and basically

and we need six whetstone and a water
source<00:01:37.140> I'd<00:01:37.470> recommend<00:01:38.250> doing<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.700> with<00:01:38.880> the

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
source I'd recommend doing it with the

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.179 
source I'd recommend doing it with the
ice<00:01:39.150> block<00:01:39.509> actually<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.560> design<00:01:40.710> is

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
ice block actually the design is

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.580 
ice block actually the design is
supposed<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.909> be<00:01:42.060> three<00:01:42.450> white<00:01:42.689> but<00:01:43.320> this

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
supposed to be three white but this

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.069 
supposed to be three white but this
block<00:01:44.009> here<00:01:44.369> is<00:01:44.399> required<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.479> keep<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.869> water

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
block here is required to keep the water

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.810 
block here is required to keep the water
in<00:01:46.200> so<00:01:46.860> three<00:01:47.490> white<00:01:48.290> six<00:01:49.290> keep<00:01:50.159> ten<00:01:50.520> and

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
in so three white six keep ten and

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.999 
in so three white six keep ten and
that's<00:01:51.810> one<00:01:52.200> two<00:01:52.590> three<00:01:53.220> four<00:01:53.729> five<00:01:54.799> so<00:01:55.799> how<00:01:55.950> to

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
that's one two three four five so how to

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.310 
that's one two three four five so how to
build<00:01:56.250> this<00:01:56.460> thing<00:01:56.520> first<00:01:57.149> we<00:01:57.329> start<00:01:57.689> with<00:01:58.020> a

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
build this thing first we start with a

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.830 
build this thing first we start with a
few<00:01:58.619> of<00:01:58.770> those<00:01:58.950> droppers<00:01:59.610> we<00:01:59.939> need<00:02:00.149> five<00:02:00.570> of

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
few of those droppers we need five of

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:22.589 
few of those droppers we need five of
them<00:02:01.140> like<00:02:01.909> heading<00:02:02.909> upwards

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:03:35.900 

we<00:02:23.019> need<00:02:23.200> one<00:02:23.469> dispenser

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.290

with the ground code because anything

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.990 
with the ground code because anything
else<00:04:11.510> would<00:04:11.690> not<00:04:12.050> work<00:04:12.610> obviously<00:04:13.610> this<00:04:13.850> is
