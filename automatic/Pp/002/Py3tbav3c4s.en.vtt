00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:11.119
 good here that I will show and caração 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:14.320
 talk a little about complex contact 

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:14.320
 heart stimulant 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:24.010
 withdrawing is that the inner part 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:26.720
 Good to begin, I'll talk about the knot. 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:29.539
 if material or totally one year of 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.660
 our usal and the heart he is 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:37.070
 located the posterior wall of the atrium 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:39.230
 right and right underneath the vein oil 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.350
 upper cava 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.149
 our material it is called as 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.000
 heart pacemaker because it is he who 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:49.399
 dictates the rhythm of the electric impulse of the 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.480
 heart and that's why he called this 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.630
 way 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.120
 from it the electric impulse is 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.700
 transmitted through the internal fish 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:02.989
 down on the side wall 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:05.200
 which are three beams in having more 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.200
 children 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:12.970
 and then reach the ventricular node 4 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:15.930
 which is also the back wall of the 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.930
 network atrium 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.610
 when the electric impulse reaches the 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:24.009
 ventricular failure to a delay in the 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:27.280
 transmission on account of the skeleton 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:29.979
 fibrous tissue that placed the 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.890
 From this point on the impulse is 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:34.950
 transmitted to the risk of beam also 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:40.210
 called the atrioventricular fascicle 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:44.289
 would be this set of fibers that 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:48.340
 beam as soon as it reaches the 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:52.060
 septal heart he 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:56.500
 bifurcates then replaced by the two branches 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:58.049
 Trash beam roma 8 I did not left 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.610
 of the kidney beam 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:04.209
 from this the electric impulse 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.909
 reach the wall of the heart and then 

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:11.260
 name is called card rising 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:13.930
 coffy bridge because that is from 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.150
 then that kiva the effort will be 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:21.959
 quickly transmitted to all 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.959
 vehicle to promote contraction
