00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:35.480 
is not as visible as if you were to do

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.310 
is not as visible as if you were to do
it<00:01:35.510> over<00:01:35.930> hand

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
it over hand

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.520 
it over hand
I<00:01:36.440> found<00:01:37.130> the<00:01:37.310> underhand<00:01:37.910> to<00:01:38.150> be<00:01:38.360> the<00:01:38.780> easiest

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
I found the underhand to be the easiest

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.460 
I found the underhand to be the easiest
option<00:01:40.130> however<00:01:41.120> I<00:01:41.450> didn't<00:01:41.990> know<00:01:42.170> it<00:01:42.350> would

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
option however I didn't know it would

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.500 
option however I didn't know it would
turn<00:01:42.710> out<00:01:42.830> like<00:01:42.890> this<00:01:43.070> if<00:01:43.520> I<00:01:43.760> did<00:01:43.940> it<00:01:44.030> underhand

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 
turn out like this if I did it underhand

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.020 
turn out like this if I did it underhand
but<00:01:45.230> now<00:01:45.350> I<00:01:45.410> know<00:01:45.590> if<00:01:45.980> you<00:01:46.130> want<00:01:46.310> to<00:01:46.460> see<00:01:46.670> a<00:01:46.700> more

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
but now I know if you want to see a more

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.110 
but now I know if you want to see a more
visible<00:01:47.480> cornrow<00:01:48.410> definitely<00:01:49.370> do<00:01:49.730> it<00:01:49.820> over

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.120 
visible cornrow definitely do it over

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.570 
visible cornrow definitely do it over
hand<00:01:50.330> so<00:01:50.990> I'm<00:01:51.050> continuing<00:01:51.290> to<00:01:51.680> braid<00:01:52.010> until<00:01:52.280> I

between<00:02:51.550> the<00:02:52.240> curls<00:02:52.750> that<00:02:53.020> I<00:02:53.200> did<00:02:53.530> on<00:02:54.100> one<00:02:54.460> side

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
between the curls that I did on one side

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.390 
between the curls that I did on one side
my<00:02:55.210> curls<00:02:55.570> look<00:02:55.780> beautiful<00:02:56.560> and<00:02:56.830> then<00:02:57.100> on<00:02:57.220> the

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
my curls look beautiful and then on the

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
and tight and it's just because I

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.000 
and tight and it's just because I
twisted<00:03:03.070> my<00:03:03.280> hair<00:03:03.959> before<00:03:04.959> actually<00:03:05.950> applying
