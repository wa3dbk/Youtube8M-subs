00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
and the best that the drug can offer it

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.729 
and the best that the drug can offer it
here<00:02:13.870> it<00:02:14.470> is<00:02:14.680> a<00:02:14.709> fusion<00:02:15.099> of<00:02:15.280> the<00:02:15.940> two<00:02:16.209> and<00:02:16.930> I

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
here it is a fusion of the two and I

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:20.400 
here it is a fusion of the two and I
think<00:02:17.769> it<00:02:18.610> is<00:02:18.790> going<00:02:19.090> to<00:02:19.209> be<00:02:19.330> a<00:02:19.360> primer<00:02:19.750> of
