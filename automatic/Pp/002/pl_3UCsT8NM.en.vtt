grow in a relatively normal manner after
surgery<00:00:58.379> they<00:00:58.530> noticed<00:00:58.920> that<00:00:59.100> they're<00:00:59.340> taller

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730

implantation<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.390> I'll<00:01:15.720> spend<00:01:16.350> several<00:01:17.220> days

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
implantation and I'll spend several days

implantation and I'll spend several days
in<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.790> intensive<00:01:18.330> care<00:01:18.360> unit<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.960> then

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
in the intensive care unit and then

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.820 
in the intensive care unit and then
about<00:01:20.100> five<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.520> seven<00:01:20.880> days<00:01:20.909> and

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
about five to seven days and

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.260 
about five to seven days and
convalescing<00:01:22.830> on<00:01:22.950> on<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.610> floor<00:01:23.850> we're

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
convalescing on on the floor we're

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.300 
convalescing on on the floor we're
expanding<00:01:24.689> their<00:01:24.960> chest<00:01:25.290> walls<00:01:25.560> this<00:01:26.250> is

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
expanding their chest walls this is

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.819 
expanding their chest walls this is
their<00:01:26.549> drive<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:26.880> breathe<00:01:27.450> this<00:01:28.409> is<00:01:28.619> their

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
their drive to breathe this is their

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.469 
their drive to breathe this is their
intercostal<00:01:29.490> muscles<00:01:29.790> their<00:01:29.939> lungs<00:01:30.240> their

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
intercostal muscles their lungs their

diaphragm<00:01:31.380> everything<00:01:31.920> is<00:01:32.040> being<00:01:32.250> changed<00:01:32.880> it

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
diaphragm everything is being changed it

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.410 
diaphragm everything is being changed it
does<00:01:33.299> give<00:01:33.540> them<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:34.200> bit<00:01:34.770> more<00:01:34.950> volume<00:01:35.420> you

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
does give them a bit more volume you

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.690 
does give them a bit more volume you
usually<00:01:36.659> have<00:01:37.070> straighten<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.159> spine<00:01:38.280> in

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
usually have straighten the spine in

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.950 
usually have straighten the spine in
many<00:01:38.880> of<00:01:39.030> these<00:01:39.150> children<00:01:39.630> so<00:01:39.780> you're

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
many of these children so you're

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.080 
many of these children so you're
improving<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:41.250> dynamics<00:01:41.880> of

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
improving the the dynamics of

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.200 
improving the the dynamics of
respiration<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.799> function<00:01:44.520> of<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.670> diaphragm

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
respiration the function of a diaphragm

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.330 
respiration the function of a diaphragm
and<00:01:45.390> before<00:01:46.049> this<00:01:46.170> implant<00:01:46.680> you<00:01:47.009> figure

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
and before this implant you figure

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.800 
and before this implant you figure
you've<00:01:47.490> got<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.700> lung<00:01:48.000> here<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.600> then<00:01:48.689> yeah

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
you've got a lung here and then yeah

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.260 
you've got a lung here and then yeah
this<00:01:49.020> was<00:01:49.170> her<00:01:49.460> that's<00:01:50.460> how<00:01:50.670> her<00:01:50.850> lungs<00:01:51.060> were

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
this was her that's how her lungs were

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.060 
this was her that's how her lungs were
and<00:01:51.509> now<00:01:51.630> they're<00:01:51.810> like<00:01:52.020> this<00:01:52.229> when<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:52.829> was<00:01:52.860> a

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
and now they're like this when I was a

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.910 
and now they're like this when I was a
baby<00:01:53.280> I<00:01:53.430> had<00:01:53.670> hard<00:01:53.970> time<00:01:54.180> breathing<00:01:54.890> when<00:01:55.890> I

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
baby I had hard time breathing when I

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.459 
baby I had hard time breathing when I
was<00:01:56.430> getting<00:01:56.850> older<00:01:57.299> I<00:01:57.329> had<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.750> use<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.259> inhaler

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:00.469 
was getting older I had to use a inhaler

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:03.080 
was getting older I had to use a inhaler
now<00:02:01.469> I'm<00:02:01.710> breathing<00:02:01.890> fine<00:02:02.310> I<00:02:02.579> don't<00:02:02.850> have<00:02:03.000> to

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
now I'm breathing fine I don't have to

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.190 
now I'm breathing fine I don't have to
use<00:02:03.270> an<00:02:03.420> inhaler

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
use an inhaler

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.080 
use an inhaler
when<00:02:04.350> you're<00:02:04.500> watching<00:02:04.740> your<00:02:05.159> child<00:02:05.399> sleeping

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
when you're watching your child sleeping

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.550 
when you're watching your child sleeping
and<00:02:06.240> you<00:02:06.299> can<00:02:06.450> see<00:02:06.810> they're<00:02:07.020> having<00:02:07.049> a<00:02:07.350> tough
