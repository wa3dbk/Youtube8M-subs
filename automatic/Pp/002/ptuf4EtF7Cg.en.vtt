00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.390 
think about some of these people that
are<00:04:16.180> you<00:04:16.720> know<00:04:16.750> living<00:04:17.109> in<00:04:17.290> these<00:04:17.410> war-torn

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
are you know living in these war-torn

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.340 
are you know living in these war-torn
countries<00:04:18.970> and<00:04:19.209> a<00:04:19.299> dealing<00:04:19.510> with<00:04:19.780> atrocities

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
countries and a dealing with atrocities

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.300 
countries and a dealing with atrocities
that<00:04:20.470> are<00:04:20.620> just<00:04:20.799> just<00:04:21.190> unfathomable<00:04:22.120> and<00:04:23.310> you

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
that are just just unfathomable and you

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.739 
that are just just unfathomable and you
know

00:04:24.739 --> 00:04:24.749 
know

00:04:24.749 --> 00:04:26.969 
know
somehow<00:04:25.749> through<00:04:26.110> the<00:04:26.259> expression<00:04:26.590> of<00:04:26.830> their

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:26.979 
somehow through the expression of their

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:28.920 
somehow through the expression of their
ability<00:04:27.460> there<00:04:27.669> the<00:04:27.939> expression<00:04:28.449> of<00:04:28.599> what<00:04:28.840> it

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
ability there the expression of what it

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.730 
ability there the expression of what it
is<00:04:28.960> to<00:04:29.349> be<00:04:29.469> able<00:04:29.590> to<00:04:29.830> decide<00:04:30.249> and<00:04:30.840> to<00:04:31.840> do<00:04:32.050> forget

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
is to be able to decide and to do forget

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.429 
is to be able to decide and to do forget
what<00:04:32.949> theory<00:04:33.849> says<00:04:34.120> and<00:04:34.539> what<00:04:34.719> logic<00:04:35.020> says

00:04:35.429 --> 00:04:35.439 
what theory says and what logic says

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:37.350 
what theory says and what logic says
sometimes<00:04:35.680> and<00:04:36.099> what<00:04:36.219> the<00:04:36.639> naysayers<00:04:37.120> will

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
sometimes and what the naysayers will

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.040 
sometimes and what the naysayers will
say<00:04:37.599> just<00:04:38.229> because<00:04:39.150> you're<00:04:40.150> able<00:04:40.509> to<00:04:40.659> decide

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
say just because you're able to decide

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.730 
say just because you're able to decide
and<00:04:41.490> follow<00:04:42.490> through<00:04:43.050> it's<00:04:44.050> amazing<00:04:44.469> so<00:04:44.590> yeah

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
and follow through it's amazing so yeah

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.800 
and follow through it's amazing so yeah
I<00:04:44.770> don't<00:04:45.099> know<00:04:45.310> what<00:04:45.999> else<00:04:46.120> I<00:04:46.330> would<00:04:46.389> be<00:04:46.569> but<00:04:46.779> I

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
I don't know what else I would be but I

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.559 
I don't know what else I would be but I
but<00:04:47.169> looking<00:04:47.650> at<00:04:47.800> looking<00:04:48.669> at<00:04:48.879> my<00:04:48.999> biological

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:49.569 
but looking at looking at my biological

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:51.839 
but looking at looking at my biological
brothers<00:04:49.840> situation<00:04:50.349> I'm<00:04:50.499> I've<00:04:51.400> been<00:04:51.610> more

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:51.849 
brothers situation I'm I've been more

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:54.089 
brothers situation I'm I've been more
inclined<00:04:52.240> to<00:04:52.389> think<00:04:52.449> that<00:04:52.719> you<00:04:53.050> know<00:04:53.169> what<00:04:53.409> you

00:04:54.089 --> 00:04:54.099 
inclined to think that you know what you

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:56.670 
inclined to think that you know what you
know<00:04:54.249> you're<00:04:55.240> the<00:04:55.479> limitations<00:04:56.139> you're<00:04:56.499> only

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
know you're the limitations you're only

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.920 
know you're the limitations you're only
as<00:04:56.949> limited<00:04:57.400> as<00:04:57.610> you<00:04:57.639> will<00:04:58.090> allow<00:04:58.330> yourself<00:04:58.539> to

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
as limited as you will allow yourself to

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:21.830 
as limited as you will allow yourself to
be<00:04:59.580> so<00:05:00.580> who<00:05:00.939> knows
