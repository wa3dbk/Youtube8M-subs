00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
know I more interested in knowing and we

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.480 
know I more interested in knowing and we

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
were talking offset about you know I

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.090 
were talking offset about you know I
first<00:01:35.909> remember<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.900> Atari<00:01:37.259> then<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:37.950> were

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
first remember the Atari then you were

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.980 
first remember the Atari then you were
really<00:01:38.280> revolutionary<00:01:39.119> when<00:01:39.540> coming<00:01:39.900> into

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
really revolutionary when coming into

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.109 
really revolutionary when coming into
gaming<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.950> some<00:01:41.430> of<00:01:41.520> these<00:01:41.579> different<00:01:41.820> games

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
gaming and some of these different games

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.880 
gaming and some of these different games
that<00:01:42.299> were<00:01:42.390> introduced<00:01:42.780> but<00:01:43.020> now<00:01:43.290> it<00:01:43.710> seems

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
that were introduced but now it seems

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.100 
that were introduced but now it seems
like<00:01:44.340> demographics<00:01:45.000> have<00:01:45.119> really<00:01:45.360> changed<00:01:45.659> to

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
like demographics have really changed to

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.950 
like demographics have really changed to
maybe<00:01:46.350> start<00:01:46.770> looking<00:01:47.130> at<00:01:47.250> opportunities

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
maybe start looking at opportunities

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.389 
maybe start looking at opportunities
with<00:01:48.960> age<00:01:49.140> groups<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:49.560> are<00:01:49.649> older<00:01:49.770> so<00:01:50.130> I'm

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
with age groups that are older so I'm

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.069 
with age groups that are older so I'm
wondering<00:01:50.549> as<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.000> industry<00:01:51.509> looks<00:01:51.780> at

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
wondering as the industry looks at

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.859 
wondering as the industry looks at
demographics<00:01:52.500> how<00:01:53.430> you<00:01:54.149> can<00:01:54.299> capitalize<00:01:54.840> that

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
demographics how you can capitalize that

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.410 
demographics how you can capitalize that
you<00:01:55.409> know<00:01:55.500> moving<00:01:55.710> forward<00:01:56.189> sure<00:01:56.549> well<00:01:57.149> I<00:01:57.180> mean

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
you know moving forward sure well I mean

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.120 
you know moving forward sure well I mean
you<00:01:57.659> hit<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:57.960> on<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.079> head<00:01:58.229> it's<00:01:58.649> fair<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:58.950> say

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
you hit it on the head it's fair to say

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.880 
you hit it on the head it's fair to say
that<00:01:59.340> 10<00:01:59.969> years<00:02:00.149> ago<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.780> core<00:02:01.229> of<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.530> gaming
