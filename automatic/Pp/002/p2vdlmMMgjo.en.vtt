00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:06.380
 in parallel 42 stories of the Andean region 

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:22.839
 ronan 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:31.289
 it would be very serious 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.349
 is a 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:34.100
 a form of design 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.090
 where can we somehow see 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.470
 an integrity between nature and the human being 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.730
 fell can coexist in harmony and in a sustainable way 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.010
 this is a bit a tool a fairly new tool 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.060
 what does it allow us in some way 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:56.230
 in this place where we live in our system in this area our farms 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.320
 in our garden to have some techniques 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.210
 to facilitate the location of the elements we make inside our 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.640
 system to be a better use of our resources 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.800
 well percent and where does this word permaculture come from 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.500
 permaculture a little feltri who coined this word 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.950
 is an Asturian munch sir himself nor are 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.680
 back in the decade of the 60s 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.360
 where he somehow wanted to live off the earth was a person who had 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.820
 been in his childhood living in natural systems 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.680
 and that somehow the system and he was destroying 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.860
 then the air principle the 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.520
 this is putting resistance to this kind of thing working in environmental groups 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.160
 but somehow I would see what 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.500
 screaming and being against did not earn much 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.320
 and decide in some way 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.220
 So a proposal 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.350
 in his retirement in his farm 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.840
 Your natural life again comes to mind this word of permaculture 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.600
 says if we can find some techniques 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.200
 something that brings together in some way this a solution for people so that 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.660
 I can go back to the fields so I can go back 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.049
 maybe in some way 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:19.259
 to the life that our grandparents did 

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:22.519
 percent that could be a solution at this time we're 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:24.039
 living 

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:25.199
 for one hundrerd 

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:26.929
 percent 

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:28.299
 ac 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:33.019
 recently a friend tells me a word so new stop 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.899
 to tell something so old so old 

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:41.019
 and if it's true permaculture is somehow taking techniques in 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.999
 millennial technical techniques that somehow 

00:02:43.999 --> 00:02:47.400
 they have used culture like him as the Chinese culture 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.739
 The aborigines 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.509
 that is, techniques from different periods 

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:54.509
 this ballast of these lides visibility 

00:02:55.289 --> 00:03:01.059
 i also that taking into account very new techniques such as the 

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:05.029
 solar use through photovoltaic cell or wind turbines 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:11.389
 so blind there is not a great display of knowledge and 

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:12.230
 techniques 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.230
 enke are framed under this 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:16.980
 from let's say 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.910
 percent and marked permaculture
