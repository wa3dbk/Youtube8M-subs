00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
first reason why I stopped putting my

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
first reason why I stopped putting my
inch<00:03:27.650> in<00:03:27.770> the<00:03:27.860> first<00:03:28.040> place<00:03:28.220> because<00:03:28.400> I

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:28.520 
inch in the first place because I

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.580 
inch in the first place because I

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.610 
thought it was bad enough that you have
to<00:03:30.740> wait<00:03:30.920> through<00:03:31.250> a<00:03:31.280> 15<00:03:32.060> second<00:03:32.360> in<00:03:32.420> a<00:03:32.810> 15

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
to wait through a 15 second in a 15

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.920 
to wait through a 15 second in a 15
second<00:03:33.980> ad<00:03:34.100> and<00:03:34.370> then<00:03:34.580> go<00:03:35.420> through<00:03:35.600> a<00:03:35.660> 10
