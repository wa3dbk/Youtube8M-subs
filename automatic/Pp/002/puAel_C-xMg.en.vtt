00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
and it's really quick at my opinion i

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.420 
and it's really quick at my opinion i
literally<00:01:49.079> just<00:01:49.110> slap<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.710> colors<00:01:49.979> on<00:01:50.189> and

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
then blend it all out and because the

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.710 
then blend it all out and because the
colors<00:01:52.680> are<00:01:52.710> so<00:01:52.860> neutral<00:01:53.520> it's<00:01:53.939> more<00:01:54.240> giving

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
properly you can probably use a sock for

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.680

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
everything but the only difference with

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.360 
everything but the only difference with
this<00:03:17.050> is<00:03:17.290> that<00:03:17.440> I'm<00:03:17.530> creating<00:03:17.770> pity<00:03:18.130> curls

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
this time as opposed to just holding in

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.080 
this time as opposed to just holding in
there<00:03:20.590> for<00:03:20.800> a<00:03:20.830> couple<00:03:20.920> seconds<00:03:21.460> like<00:03:21.640> ain't

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
there for a couple seconds like ain't

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.120 
there for a couple seconds like ain't
nobody<00:03:22.150> got<00:03:22.540> time<00:03:22.570> for<00:03:22.900> that<00:03:22.960> so<00:03:23.620> I'm<00:03:23.980> actually

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130
