00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:24.509 
soy conditioner and shampoo now I have

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:26.780 
soy conditioner and shampoo now I have
never<00:00:24.840> used<00:00:25.230> our<00:00:25.410> product<00:00:25.830> line<00:00:25.980> before<00:00:26.400> but

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:26.790 
never used our product line before but

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.740 
never used our product line before but
they<00:00:26.970> are<00:00:27.239> almost<00:00:28.520> natural<00:00:29.520> not<00:00:30.419> a<00:00:30.450> hundred

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
they are almost natural not a hundred

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.150 
they are almost natural not a hundred
percent<00:00:31.259> so<00:00:31.739> these<00:00:31.950> are<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.220> burpees<00:00:34.160> again

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160
