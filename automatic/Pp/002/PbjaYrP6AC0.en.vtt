00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
good background because you understand

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.950 
good background because you understand

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
by they lost sometimes I open you know

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.910 
by they lost sometimes I open you know
well<00:03:24.220> top<00:03:24.550> you've<00:03:25.239> really<00:03:25.480> the<00:03:25.600> top<00:03:25.750> points<00:03:26.080> to

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
well top you've really the top points to

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.350 
well top you've really the top points to
pour<00:03:27.130> by<00:03:27.250> the<00:03:27.310> glass<00:03:27.519> because<00:03:27.940> people<00:03:28.209> have

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
pour by the glass because people have

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.750 
pour by the glass because people have
that<00:03:28.510> confidence<00:03:29.500> which<00:03:29.830> is<00:03:29.860> a<00:03:30.010> and<00:03:30.459> I<00:03:30.550> think

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
that confidence which is a and I think

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.460 
that confidence which is a and I think
that's<00:03:31.120> important<00:03:31.630> too<00:03:31.750> because<00:03:31.930> being<00:03:32.350> a

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
that's important too because being a

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:33.270 
that's important too because being a
good<00:03:32.620> server<00:03:32.830> year

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
good server year

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.130 
good server year

Sommelier<00:04:07.780> I<00:04:07.840> think<00:04:08.050> wasn't<00:04:08.290> really<00:04:08.500> known<00:04:08.620> in

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
Europe it was more in America and I

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.590 
Europe it was more in America and I
learned<00:04:11.530> about<00:04:11.800> that<00:04:11.980> just<00:04:12.220> around<00:04:12.490> 2005<00:04:13.150> and

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
learned about that just around 2005 and

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.810 
learned about that just around 2005 and
who<00:04:14.230> five<00:04:14.500> I<00:04:14.710> started<00:04:15.130> my<00:04:15.190> preparation<00:04:15.700> for

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:15.820 
who five I started my preparation for

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.670 
who five I started my preparation for
the<00:04:15.910> best<00:04:16.060> familiar<00:04:16.330> of<00:04:16.420> the<00:04:16.480> world<00:04:16.690> so<00:04:17.650> I

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
the best familiar of the world so I

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.800 
the best familiar of the world so I
really<00:04:18.370> didn't<00:04:18.580> have<00:04:18.670> the<00:04:18.700> time<00:04:18.820> to<00:04:19.030> do<00:04:19.330> it<00:04:19.360> and

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
really didn't have the time to do it and

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.810 
really didn't have the time to do it and
once<00:04:20.260> I<00:04:20.440> wanted<00:04:20.739> it<00:04:20.920> would<00:04:21.070> feel<00:04:21.220> a<00:04:21.280> bit<00:04:21.520> you

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
once I wanted it would feel a bit you

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.030 
once I wanted it would feel a bit you
know<00:04:21.940> silly<00:04:22.360> to<00:04:22.570> start<00:04:22.630> from<00:04:23.500> square<00:04:23.710> one

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
know silly to start from square one

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.190 
know silly to start from square one
okay<00:04:24.640> and<00:04:25.150> the<00:04:25.420> better<00:04:25.630> thing<00:04:25.810> for<00:04:25.840> certainly

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
okay and the better thing for certainly

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.840 
okay and the better thing for certainly
as<00:04:26.350> the<00:04:26.470> Muslim<00:04:26.770> there<00:04:26.920> is<00:04:26.980> a<00:04:27.070> very<00:04:27.550> good<00:04:27.640> thing

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
as the Muslim there is a very good thing

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.990 
as the Muslim there is a very good thing
and<00:04:28.710> for<00:04:29.710> somebody<00:04:29.920> that's<00:04:30.280> more<00:04:30.490> important

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
and for somebody that's more important

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.670 
and for somebody that's more important
than<00:04:31.030> a<00:04:31.120> master<00:04:31.450> wine<00:04:31.630> master<00:04:32.230> one<00:04:32.380> is<00:04:32.470> more

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
than a master wine master one is more

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.070 
than a master wine master one is more
academic<00:04:33.610> language<00:04:33.850> so<00:04:34.540> if<00:04:34.630> you<00:04:34.720> have<00:04:34.900> the

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
academic language so if you have the

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.340 
academic language so if you have the
time<00:04:35.350> and<00:04:35.710> you<00:04:36.400> know<00:04:37.030> this<00:04:37.180> study<00:04:37.420> takes<00:04:38.110> time

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:38.350 
time and you know this study takes time

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.100 
time and you know this study takes time
and<00:04:38.590> cost<00:04:39.250> a<00:04:39.430> bit<00:04:39.550> more<00:04:39.580> money<00:04:39.940> probably<00:04:40.870> to

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
and cost a bit more money probably to

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.080 
and cost a bit more money probably to
attend<00:04:41.380> all<00:04:41.530> those<00:04:41.740> seven<00:04:42.430> or<00:04:42.550> so<00:04:42.820> I<00:04:42.850> think

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
attend all those seven or so I think

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.420 
attend all those seven or so I think
that's<00:04:43.450> something<00:04:43.780> you<00:04:43.870> do<00:04:44.020> as<00:04:44.380> you<00:04:44.620> as<00:04:45.280> you

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
that's something you do as you as you

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.550 
that's something you do as you as you
grow<00:04:45.580> older<00:04:45.630> so<00:04:46.630> if<00:04:46.840> you<00:04:46.960> had<00:04:47.080> opportunity

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
grow older so if you had opportunity

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.810 
grow older so if you had opportunity
before<00:04:47.680> you<00:04:47.890> started<00:04:48.220> to<00:04:48.310> prepare<00:04:48.430> yourself

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
before you started to prepare yourself

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.550 
before you started to prepare yourself
for<00:04:48.940> the<00:04:49.030> European<00:04:49.420> Championship<00:04:49.930> you<00:04:50.140> you

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
for the European Championship you you

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.980 
for the European Championship you you
