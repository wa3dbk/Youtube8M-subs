00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:08.670
 listen well and pay attention with the 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:12.120
 film on that has a piston 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:16.619
 I'm a sailor come from hong kong continues 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:20.100
 and you take the rudder not of whiskey and 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:23.300
 put the stove takes the rudder that has a 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.300
 nolan type 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:29.029
 maybe the table is not knave 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:39.530
 I will teach you with my boot what is the 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:41.210
 tenacity with the rudder and then here I suppose 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.010
 what do you mean the pirate song is 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.110
 a rhythmic song destined to increase 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.760
 the productivity is crazy but 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.790
 it works really look we have done this 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.530
 movie in less than three minutes 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.480
 great but that raises more questions 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.670
 unanswered 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.350
 come and make hair ornaments 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.720
 and I helped him optimize the process 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.210
 manufacturing worth rest and if 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.369
 I do not obey that in the galleon 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.590
 I am using as an adhesive element 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:08.720
 hot tail you say any 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.670
 cyanoacrylate would paste this better not 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.350
 it will work the flowers are very porous and 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.060
 if we will prepare the inner layer with 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:18.440
 silicone before to create a surface 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.729
 more stable intriguing what are your 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.890
 marketing and distribution channels 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.659
 good are the waitresses of my work 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.840
 and a small shop level in your car are 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.369
 virtually nonexistent I had 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.690
 thought of organizing a system of 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.160
 electronic commerce in any 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.690
 server why not remove 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.640
 intermediary we can install a 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.320
 small server with a static ip in 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.210
 its which would need cooling 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.320
 industrial of course but before 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.850
 assemble the infrastructure of 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.229
 distribution and marketing would have to 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.220
 continue optimizing the process 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.479
 manufacturing 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.520
 to start penny has a tremendous 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.640
 problem gets glitter on 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.990
 powder 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.990
 if it's a bitch 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:02:00.299
 and this sounds like 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.299
 I got the strippers them too 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.270
 when they dance sweat and hit them 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.240
 gross 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.280
 are you thinking of adding a blotter like 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:16.140
 calcium sulfate was actually 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.140
 thinking of a stripper called truth 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:24.190
 but if calcium sulfate would be worth 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:27.460
 let's be more original for a moment and 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.350
 a molecular khamis 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.680
 I have a vegetable drainer in the 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.680
 kitchen 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.500
 go 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.850
 or we could release microporous carbon 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.380
 from the lab not great extras because 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.790
 you are not going your son now for the carbon 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.740
 leonhart because you do not start working 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.510
 in the design of the website there is no 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.180
 site in our apartment to move the 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:57.500
 manufacturing chain there what has 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.490
 bad my floor that is not my floor awaits and 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.530
 what do i do 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.650
 is your business can you do what 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.650
 want 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.290
 cool voucher 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.860
 I'll take a nap
