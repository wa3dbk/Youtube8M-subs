00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.279

 drop on the smell of onion the tomato 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:09.600
 You do not have to take off your skin 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.520
 just not 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.520

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:23.789
 there you will get a good olive oil and go 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.670
 being generous is understood 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:29.360

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.979

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:17.430

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.620
 in the championship you put something fresh 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:23.400
