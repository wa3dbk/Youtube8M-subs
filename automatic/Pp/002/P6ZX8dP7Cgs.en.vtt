can tell by looking at these rags look
how<00:01:46.740> bad<00:01:46.979> this<00:01:47.220> looks

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.810 

this<00:01:51.890> is<00:01:52.130> all<00:01:52.930> rust<00:01:54.220> that<00:01:55.220> was<00:01:55.370> in<00:01:55.550> the<00:01:55.670> water

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
this is all rust that was in the water

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.430 
this is all rust that was in the water
and<00:01:56.210> once<00:01:57.170> I<00:01:57.350> put<00:01:57.620> chlorine<00:01:57.950> in<00:01:58.490> the<00:01:58.970> water

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
and once I put chlorine in the water

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.460 
and once I put chlorine in the water
that's<00:02:00.440> what<00:02:00.830> my<00:02:00.980> pore<00:02:01.220> water<00:02:01.400> looked<00:02:01.730> like

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
that it looked like that so we did that

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.840

and<00:02:52.459> then<00:02:53.270> overnight<00:02:53.690> we<00:02:54.200> left<00:02:54.470> the<00:02:56.050> pump<00:02:57.050> run

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
and then overnight we left the pump run

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.300 
and then overnight we left the pump run
but<00:02:58.850> we<00:02:59.120> did<00:02:59.330> that<00:02:59.540> for<00:02:59.810> two<00:03:00.050> days<00:03:00.080> and<00:03:00.709> two

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
but we did that for two days and two

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.360 
but we did that for two days and two
nights<00:03:01.810> leaving<00:03:02.810> the<00:03:02.959> the<00:03:03.620> pump<00:03:04.070> run

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
nights leaving the the pump run

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.390 
nights leaving the the pump run
continuously<00:03:05.180> and<00:03:05.709> every<00:03:06.709> time<00:03:06.950> we<00:03:07.280> would

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
continuously and every time we would

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.090 
continuously and every time we would
take<00:03:07.610> the<00:03:07.790> rag<00:03:08.030> off<00:03:08.360> of<00:03:08.600> there<00:03:08.840> that's<00:03:09.680> what<00:03:09.980> it

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
take the rag off of there that's what it

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.360 
take the rag off of there that's what it
would<00:03:10.220> look<00:03:10.370> like<00:03:11.049> we<00:03:12.049> went<00:03:12.380> through<00:03:12.739> a<00:03:12.950> few

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
would look like we went through a few

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.699 
would look like we went through a few
rags

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
rags

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.530 
rags
we<00:03:15.709> kept<00:03:16.010> rinsing<00:03:16.580> them<00:03:16.640> out<00:03:16.850> getting<00:03:17.269> all<00:03:17.390> the

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
we kept rinsing them out getting all the

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:23.560 
we kept rinsing them out getting all the
iron<00:03:17.720> off<00:03:18.290> of<00:03:18.680> them<00:03:18.860> and<00:03:19.540> I<00:03:21.220> still<00:03:22.220> I<00:03:23.000> haven't

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
iron off of them and I still I haven't

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.960 
iron off of them and I still I haven't
had<00:03:23.959> to<00:03:24.620> put<00:03:24.799> the<00:03:24.920> rag<00:03:25.100> on<00:03:25.340> there<00:03:25.519> because<00:03:25.790> the

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
had to put the rag on there because the

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.350 
had to put the rag on there because the
water<00:03:26.000> did<00:03:26.450> clear<00:03:26.840> up<00:03:27.049> I<00:03:27.320> kept<00:03:28.250> taking<00:03:28.580> the

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
water did clear up I kept taking the

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.009 
water did clear up I kept taking the
filter<00:03:29.810> out<00:03:29.840> and<00:03:31.330> with<00:03:32.330> the<00:03:32.450> garden<00:03:32.780> hose

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
filter out and with the garden hose

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:36.280 
filter out and with the garden hose
rinsing<00:03:33.769> it<00:03:33.920> off<00:03:34.040> and<00:03:34.690> like<00:03:35.690> I<00:03:35.840> said<00:03:36.080> as<00:03:36.260> you

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
rinsing it off and like I said as you

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.930 
rinsing it off and like I said as you
can<00:03:36.709> see<00:03:37.150> the<00:03:38.150> water<00:03:38.420> is<00:03:38.660> now<00:03:38.870> crystal<00:03:39.470> clear

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
can see the water is now crystal clear

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.670 
can see the water is now crystal clear
but<00:03:40.940> there<00:03:41.570> still<00:03:41.690> is<00:03:41.930> lead<00:03:42.560> in<00:03:42.860> the<00:03:43.549> water<00:03:43.820> and

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
but there still is lead in the water and

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:52.150 
but there still is lead in the water and
I<00:03:45.680> still<00:03:46.340> have<00:03:47.620> to<00:03:48.880> check<00:03:49.880> this<00:03:50.920> daily<00:03:51.920> and

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
I still have to check this daily and

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.480 
I still have to check this daily and
this<00:03:53.030> is<00:03:53.269> what

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:54.490 
this is what

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.080 
this is what
I'm<00:03:54.580> still<00:03:55.090> getting<00:03:56.080> out<00:03:56.800> of<00:03:57.100> the<00:03:57.220> pool<00:03:57.430> let's

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
I'm still getting out of the pool let's

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:03.860 
I'm still getting out of the pool let's
look<00:03:58.660> at<00:03:58.840> that<00:03:59.050> yes<00:03:59.700> that<00:04:00.700> is<00:04:01.480> my<00:04:01.870> filter<00:04:02.350> but

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
instead of going out and buying filter

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.410 
instead of going out and buying filter
filter<00:04:07.300> filter<00:04:08.010> what<00:04:09.010> I<00:04:09.040> have<00:04:09.430> been<00:04:09.670> doing<00:04:10.120> is
