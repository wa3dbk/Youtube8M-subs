00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:07.500
 Good morning rings at the start and today 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.290
 There is a small change for a change 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.750
 video what do we cook the nice how 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.330
 will make porridge so oatmeal 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.609
 Didier boil and then we become one 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.740
 little rain will be added to the 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.789
 taste of course to the height 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.859
 I say drive 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.050
 the whole thing has great nourishment and 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.810
 tastes really good and above all it 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.029
 It's very fast and you do not need it 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.579
 Anything else in the world 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.079
 Internet or then you want to buy all 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.540
 things that you do now 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.850
 you can use in all genetics or 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.040
 Elsewhere you can not buy them 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.629
 problem would not have to be somewhere from 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.940
 order any internet pages 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.520
 and summarizes the whole 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.739
 Fruits in the super nice have a special 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.170
 a lot of fiber for me 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.020
 very little calories and still enough 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.210
 Rice and the best that say it tastes 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.190
 simply top so be curious 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.649
 So whatever we have for fun 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.840
 oatmeal quite normal flakes one 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.150
 can also use thick flakes only that 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.890
 bad not only good addresses he 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.619
 so value us less fat 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.080
 then you need to get there while I will 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.689
 use frozen in bern 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:18.090
 yet fresh take a day 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.360
 before in the refrigerator then all the way 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.670
 normal and sweetener I use sukalo 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.900
 are on the used i find klose 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.369
 with the longest 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.790
 then we start now, too 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.470
 could turn off the quantities 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.030
 This will vary depending on me 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.520
 already recommendations for the same 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.240
 to take a relationship with him 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:45.679
 all goes well now 40 grams of tobacco 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:51.670
 lure a bit too much 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:55.939
 less than 40 grams 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.130
 then I would need 100 more water 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:07.369
 milliliter 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:09.410
 but that is enough then if 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:12.410
 suddenly substance used then 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.530
 Of course you have to keep experimenting 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.910
 how much hops everyone needs that comes 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.829
 now at the highest level for two 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:24.920
 minutes in the microwave often so me 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:26.840
 because of my hard flakes and duman 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.090
 through still free in the time before his 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.549
 microwave is i put my make-up 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.519
 probably my life will be out of this way one has 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:36.319
 keep the optimal time schedule for the 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:46.720
 Oatmeal is now also cook and 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:46.720
 Now the raspberry Rhine come a 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:53.780
 bit for me why first child in 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.720
 do not get that never more 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:59.150
 give a little water and wayne 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.400
 is then you better if you solve that 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.170
 So Rector in does so with the water 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.560
 and bring salt to a boil then it becomes one 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:09.139
 cake and we want to make recognized 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.700
 and to the conclusion come that comes the 

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:15.500
 was the now 40 like to isolate 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.970
 I know the chocolate next to or otherwise 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.970
 Also can we have been giving a 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.870
 I also often live in Heidelberg 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.769
 together with some chocolate 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:27.620
 combinations and now the whole only 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:29.930
 still over and we are already done and 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.750
 this is how the finished product looks like 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.940
 Do not say it so delicious though 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.919
 Tastes great and you can optional 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.930
 Of course all kinds of nuts are included 

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:40.069
 I personally prefer when I use 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.620
 running clock almonds 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:43.760
 I think fits super otherwise 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.590
 Of course you can do that with everyone 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.859
 possible way or anyone 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.719
 Possible fruits are the fantasy 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:52.730
 no limits set and also the 

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:54.799
 quantities can of course be families 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.540
 like i said i would just mind that 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:58.340
 The ratio is about the same then 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.409
 tastes great so that's it 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.989
 with the small but fine rz video 

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:05.060
 the three-day super delicious super fast 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:06.469
 and I believe we have simplified 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.030
 every case fulfilled and above all with 

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:09.799
 food that everyone has 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.389
 So nobody needs any leaning 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:13.639
 to buy them in the middle of nowhere 

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:15.829
 memorial every fitness enthusiast person 

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:16.579
 is something like that or something like that in the 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:18.769
 have a bag 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:22.220
 For my quantities we have recently been 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.910
 42 grams of protein for 14 years 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.380
 roughage 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.840
 so we just mentioned about 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.250
 Nutrition and it was already there is no 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.970

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.220
