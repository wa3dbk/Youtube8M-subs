of<00:01:21.470> 1920<00:01:22.470> in<00:01:23.210> retrospect<00:01:24.210> I<00:01:24.479> probably<00:01:24.509> should

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
of 1920 in retrospect I probably should

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.260 
of 1920 in retrospect I probably should
have<00:01:25.439> put<00:01:25.710> out<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.340> higher<00:01:26.700> bet<00:01:27.060> they're

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
have put out a higher bet they're

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.260 
have put out a higher bet they're
probably<00:01:27.600> at<00:01:27.900> least<00:01:27.990> thousand<00:01:28.740> 1200<00:01:29.549> but<00:01:30.090> look

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
probably at least thousand 1200 but look

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.690 
probably at least thousand 1200 but look
what<00:01:30.450> falls<00:01:30.780> it<00:01:31.380> looks<00:01:31.799> pretty<00:01:32.280> harmless

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
what falls it looks pretty harmless

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.670 
what falls it looks pretty harmless
there's<00:01:33.119> no<00:01:33.360> heart<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:34.110> me<00:01:34.200> he<00:01:34.320> was<00:01:34.439> totally

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
there's no heart to me he was totally

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.190 
there's no heart to me he was totally
looking<00:01:35.070> for<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.700> heart<00:01:36.450> draw<00:01:36.689> there<00:01:36.960> with<00:01:37.170> a

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
looking for a heart draw there with a

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.149 
looking for a heart draw there with a
quick<00:01:37.590> call<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.450> that<00:01:39.450> is<00:01:39.689> indicative<00:01:40.049> of<00:01:40.259> a

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
quick call and that is indicative of a

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.370 
quick call and that is indicative of a
player<00:01:41.729> willing<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.299> gamble<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.960> we<00:01:43.140> know

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
player willing to gamble and we know

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.170 
player willing to gamble and we know
that<00:01:43.619> that's<00:01:43.829> what<00:01:44.070> he's<00:01:44.280> willing<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.670> do<00:01:44.909> here

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
that that's what he's willing to do here

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.600 
that that's what he's willing to do here
however<00:01:45.869> just<00:01:46.500> because<00:01:46.649> he<00:01:46.979> called<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.490> there

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
however just because he called and there

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.410 
however just because he called and there
is<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.790> jack<00:01:48.180> there<00:01:48.570> I<00:01:48.840> decide<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.710> check<00:01:49.979> and

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.710 
I really think he missed his draw and I
can't<00:02:18.300> see<00:02:18.570> how<00:02:18.690> that<00:02:18.720> four<00:02:19.320> helped<00:02:19.710> him<00:02:20.720> he

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720
