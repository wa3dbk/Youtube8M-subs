you're<00:03:56.900> gonna<00:03:56.989> be<00:03:57.169> cutting<00:03:57.379> holes<00:03:57.739> all<00:03:57.980> over

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
you're gonna be cutting holes all over

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.920 
you're gonna be cutting holes all over
your<00:03:58.370> drywall<00:03:58.579> ceiling<00:03:58.940> trying<00:03:59.419> to<00:03:59.540> find

these shut offs trying to find these
junction<00:04:02.780> boxes<00:04:03.109> at<00:04:03.260> a<00:04:03.290> later<00:04:03.500> time<00:04:03.590> so<00:04:04.489> just

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:04.699 
junction boxes at a later time so just

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:07.270 
junction boxes at a later time so just
mark<00:04:05.030> them<00:04:05.209> and<00:04:05.419> tell<00:04:05.629> you<00:04:05.780> drywallers<00:04:06.470> a<00:04:06.799> few

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
mark them and tell you drywallers a few

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.220 
mark them and tell you drywallers a few
if<00:04:07.400> you're<00:04:07.519> subbing<00:04:07.730> the<00:04:07.879> drywall<00:04:08.269> out<00:04:08.389> to<00:04:09.019> cut

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
if you're subbing the drywall out to cut

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.740 
if you're subbing the drywall out to cut
a<00:04:09.260> one-inch<00:04:09.530> hole<00:04:09.949> around<00:04:10.280> the<00:04:10.849> piece<00:04:11.540> of

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
a one-inch hole around the piece of

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.869 
a one-inch hole around the piece of
caution<00:04:12.169> tape<00:04:12.349> and<00:04:12.620> let<00:04:13.310> it<00:04:13.400> hang<00:04:13.609> right

00:04:13.869 --> 00:04:13.879 
caution tape and let it hang right

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:15.460 
caution tape and let it hang right
through<00:04:14.150> the<00:04:14.239> drywall<00:04:14.690> and<00:04:14.810> then<00:04:14.930> at<00:04:15.139> a<00:04:15.169> later

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
through the drywall and then at a later

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.550 
through the drywall and then at a later
time<00:04:15.590> you'll<00:04:16.549> know<00:04:16.729> exactly<00:04:17.000> where<00:04:17.870> to<00:04:17.900> cut<00:04:17.989> in

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
time you'll know exactly where to cut in

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.339 
time you'll know exactly where to cut in
and<00:04:18.799> install<00:04:19.430> your<00:04:19.609> access<00:04:20.000> panels<00:04:20.359> there's

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:21.349 
and install your access panels there's

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:24.400 
and install your access panels there's
another<00:04:21.650> sample<00:04:22.220> there<00:04:22.570> and<00:04:23.570> one<00:04:24.199> more

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
another sample there and one more

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.170 
another sample there and one more
example<00:04:24.530> over<00:04:25.099> here<00:04:25.130> and<00:04:25.520> I<00:04:25.699> think<00:04:25.910> that'll<00:04:26.150> be

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
example over here and I think that'll be

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.020 
example over here and I think that'll be
enough<00:04:26.979> examples<00:04:27.979> for<00:04:28.159> you<00:04:28.340> we've<00:04:29.000> got

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
enough examples for you we've got

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.510 
enough examples for you we've got
another<00:04:29.510> one<00:04:29.870> of<00:04:30.320> those<00:04:30.440> junction<00:04:31.010> boxes<00:04:31.370> this

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
another one of those junction boxes this

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.260 
another one of those junction boxes this
is<00:04:31.700> around

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
is around

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.900 
is around

all right that's a code violation we

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.110 
all right that's a code violation we
have<00:05:12.530> to<00:05:12.740> cut<00:05:13.160> around<00:05:13.280> it<00:05:13.550> and<00:05:13.759> put<00:05:13.880> a<00:05:13.910> blank

have to cut around it and put a blank
cover<00:05:14.330> on<00:05:14.509> it<00:05:14.539> if<00:05:14.960> we<00:05:15.020> can't<00:05:15.500> eliminate<00:05:15.650> it<00:05:16.009> and

we<00:05:16.340> could<00:05:16.580> not<00:05:16.759> eliminate<00:05:17.000> that<00:05:17.419> box<00:05:21.610> all

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
we could not eliminate that box all

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.029 
we could not eliminate that box all
right<00:05:22.759> and<00:05:23.060> one<00:05:23.449> last<00:05:23.720> example<00:05:24.229> since<00:05:24.860> it's

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:25.039 
right and one last example since it's

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:27.520 
right and one last example since it's
right<00:05:25.159> outside<00:05:25.520> the<00:05:25.669> bathroom<00:05:26.320> one<00:05:27.320> more

right outside the bathroom one more
shutoff<00:05:27.979> up<00:05:28.190> there<00:05:28.870> goes<00:05:29.870> to<00:05:29.990> an<00:05:30.139> outside<00:05:30.530> hose

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 
shutoff up there goes to an outside hose
