00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
because they say that that residue was

00:00:52.520 --> 00:01:00.790 
because they say that that residue was
made<00:00:53.240> to<00:00:53.330> away<00:00:58.000> yeah<00:00:59.080> I'm<00:01:00.080> not<00:01:00.290> worried

you<00:01:01.130> can<00:01:05.410> use<00:01:08.560> this<00:01:09.560> how<00:01:11.140> tofu<00:01:12.140> rescue<00:01:14.260> and

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:15.260 
you can use this how tofu rescue and

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.680 
you can use this how tofu rescue and
then<00:01:15.440> we<00:01:15.590> are<00:01:15.680> going<00:01:15.860> to<00:01:16.010> use<00:01:16.490> the<00:01:17.030> dough<00:01:17.180> this

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
then we are going to use the dough this

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.400 
then we are going to use the dough this
is<00:01:17.750> the<00:01:17.900> dough<00:01:18.080> is<00:01:18.920> even<00:01:19.540> longer<00:01:20.540> than<00:01:20.780> this<00:01:21.140> is

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:21.410 
is the dough is even longer than this is

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:28.050 
is the dough is even longer than this is
the<00:01:21.560> type<00:01:21.740> of<00:01:24.040> Japanese<00:01:25.960> it's<00:01:26.960> very<00:01:27.229> healthy

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
the type of Japanese it's very healthy

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:34.590 
the type of Japanese it's very healthy
it<00:01:29.060> has<00:01:29.180> a<00:01:29.240> property<00:01:29.840> as<00:01:30.650> I<00:01:30.710> understand<00:01:31.280> making

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.020 

digital<00:01:35.600> master<00:01:35.950> basically<00:01:36.950> so<00:01:37.220> we<00:01:37.610> can<00:01:37.790> state

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
digital master basically so we can state

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.260 
digital master basically so we can state
water<00:01:38.360> in<00:01:39.200> the<00:01:39.320> chemistry<00:01:39.740> and<00:01:40.490> marinate<00:01:41.060> the

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
water in the chemistry and marinate the

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:47.690 
water in the chemistry and marinate the
research<00:01:44.650> after<00:01:45.650> week

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
and once they come in the district soap

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:15.030 
and once they come in the district soap
into<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.820> water<00:02:00.210> because<00:02:01.049> how<00:02:01.500> do<00:02:01.560> I<00:02:01.679> discover

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.230 

the<00:04:19.750> texture<00:04:20.410> make<00:04:21.190> the<00:04:21.370> flight<00:04:21.760> interesting

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
the texture make the flight interesting

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.810 
the texture make the flight interesting
teach<00:04:22.510> them<00:04:22.840> or<00:04:23.530> with<00:04:23.710> them<00:04:23.740> it<00:04:24.160> has<00:04:24.340> drove<00:04:24.610> a

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820
