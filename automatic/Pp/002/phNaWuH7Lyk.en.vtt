 fitzpatrick 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.190
 this is a saga that consists of four 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.200
 joaquim books growing silent and 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.760
 final I just bought the versions 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.890
 in English because I really need 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.199
 practice it and what better to do it with 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.300
 some books that I enjoy so much I'm going to 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.910
 specifically focus on the first 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.579
 book that is what gives the name to the 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.949
 history 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:05.290
 like a young redhead of 16 years 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:07.450
 Nora call no relationship with 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.369
 cristian which has never been felt 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.409
 attracted by any boy of a 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:13.140
 school or anywhere else until a 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:15.189
 day during biology class 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.180
 sex education to be more 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:18.100
 specific 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.960
 the teacher decides to make a change 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.210
 working couples moving away from this 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.939
 way now of her best friend riesch 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.289
 Kan is a voluptuous blonde who always 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:27.970
 wants to have a good time the new 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:29.890
 partner from now on is a boy 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.259
 Mysterious eyes and black hair 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.819
 known only as pacho she does not 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:35.289
 is very happy with this because the 

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:37.360
 first assignment of homework is 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:39.459
 investigate about the personal life of 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.860
 new partner and in truth you do not see 

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:43.659
 very eager to participate at least not in 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.850
 a school environment but eventually 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:48.580
 the scars Patxi has on his 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.159
 back with an inverted v shape and 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.780
 will help decipher who or what in 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:55.030
 reality is he 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.520
 a couple of characters enter the scene 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.590
 whose past baffles quite a lot 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.750
 hour from this point they begin to 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.690
 arise situations that make her take 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.060
 unthinkable decisions and before that 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.399
 I knew next it just happens that 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.050
 he awakens to his more adventurous side what 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.580
 which is pretty good because his life 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.709
 start with the cats while you 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.720
 develops the story the relationship between 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.180
 pajÃ­n now becomes stronger and the 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.220
 sensual and romantic side of patxi out to 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.870
 Finally, this is a book that 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.120
 I recommend if you feel like 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.700
 read something romantic about intrigue and 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.160
 fantasy without a doubt I assure you that 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.470
 you are going to like this book I give a 5 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.420
 about 5 because since I started reading it 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.120
 the story captivated me with telling them that 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.959
 has three hundred and ninety- nine pages and I read it in 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.150
 one day 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.709
 in fact I read the entire saga in four 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.750
 days which is an achievement because 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.760
 consider that I have 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.500
 I like the description that the 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.690
 author about the places is what 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.850
 sufficiently detailed so that 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.250
 one imagines the places although not so much 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.260
 as to make it tedious and tired but 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.450
 I especially like patxi is my 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.370
 favorite character not only from the saga 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.080
 but in general when you read 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.209
 I'm sure it's going to happen to them 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.340
 same is that I can imagine your voice 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.810
 ringing in my head I sometimes feel that 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.790
 not now it does not deserve it because it is 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.350
 too perfect I remind you that in 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.150
 the description will leave you the knicks for 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.800

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.660

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.400
 talk with you but as always 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.350
 I also leave the dams in the 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.270
 description I hope the comments 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.830

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.540

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.070
 recommendations so that I can 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.630
