then<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:31.920> wild<00:02:32.129> thing<00:02:32.430> about<00:02:32.640> walls<00:02:33.290> is<00:02:34.290> there

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
then the wild thing about walls is there

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.759 
then the wild thing about walls is there
this<00:02:35.540> is<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.810> prenup<00:02:37.470> they<00:02:37.590> put<00:02:37.799> in<00:02:37.890> here

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
this is the prenup they put in here

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:41.210 
this is the prenup they put in here
they're<00:02:40.769> not

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
they're not

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.890 
they're not
these<00:02:41.519> are<00:02:41.670> tone<00:02:42.090> controls<00:02:42.510> but<00:02:42.659> they're<00:02:42.780> not

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
these are tone controls but they're not

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:52.000 
these are tone controls but they're not
tone<00:02:43.230> controls<00:02:43.620> these<00:02:43.739> are<00:02:44.989> low-pass<00:02:45.989> filters

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:03:11.340 

it<00:02:53.010> sounds<00:02:53.340> like

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:18.790 

finds<00:03:12.350> weird<00:03:13.240> sound<00:03:17.290> and<00:03:18.290> then<00:03:18.530> in<00:03:18.680> addition

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
finds weird sound and then in addition

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.660 
finds weird sound and then in addition
to<00:03:19.190> that<00:03:20.319> you<00:03:21.319> have<00:03:21.530> you<00:03:22.069> could<00:03:22.220> pull<00:03:22.489> these

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
to that you have you could pull these

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.130 
to that you have you could pull these
tone<00:03:22.970> knobs<00:03:23.239> out<00:03:25.569> and<00:03:26.569> I'm<00:03:26.690> not<00:03:26.840> really<00:03:27.020> sure

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
tone knobs out and I'm not really sure

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.770 
tone knobs out and I'm not really sure
what<00:03:28.069> the<00:03:28.190> technical<00:03:28.670> terms<00:03:28.940> I<00:03:29.270> know<00:03:29.420> what's

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
what the technical terms I know what's

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.550 
what the technical terms I know what's
going<00:03:29.989> on<00:03:30.080> when<00:03:30.260> you<00:03:30.350> do<00:03:30.500> that

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.660 

it<00:03:34.280> seems<00:03:34.520> to<00:03:34.700> make<00:03:34.910> like<00:03:35.209> a<00:03:35.240> brighter<00:03:35.810> tray

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:45.540 

here<00:03:41.610> same<00:03:42.610> with<00:03:42.730> the<00:03:42.790> base<00:03:42.940> knob<00:03:43.270> up<00:03:44.310> based<00:03:45.310> on

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:45.550 
here same with the base knob up based on

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:50.640 
here same with the base knob up based on
the<00:03:46.209> B<00:03:46.420> pick<00:03:46.720> up<00:03:46.870> B<00:03:49.050> seems<00:03:50.050> to<00:03:50.200> be<00:03:50.290> even<00:03:50.470> more

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
the B pick up B seems to be even more

00:03:50.650 --> 00:04:16.530 
the B pick up B seems to be even more
extreme<00:03:56.580> and<00:03:57.580> push<00:03:58.090> full<00:03:58.330> pot<00:03:58.569> again<00:04:15.419> so<00:04:16.419> you

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 
extreme and push full pot again so you

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:28.490 
extreme and push full pot again so you
can<00:04:16.630> kind<00:04:16.840> of<00:04:16.930> dial<00:04:17.169> in<00:04:17.380> these<00:04:17.500> two<00:04:17.709> filters

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:38.310 

between<00:04:29.500> these<00:04:29.620> pickups<00:04:30.130> of<00:04:37.139> course<00:04:38.139> I<00:04:38.290> just

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
between these pickups of course I just

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.260 
between these pickups of course I just
like<00:04:39.419> both<00:04:40.419> pots<00:04:41.110> pulled<00:04:41.560> out<00:04:41.770> in<00:04:42.070> the<00:04:42.790> BT

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
like both pots pulled out in the BT

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:59.670 
like both pots pulled out in the BT
position

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.529 

and<00:05:00.680> then<00:05:00.919> and<00:05:01.280> then<00:05:01.759> we<00:05:01.849> get<00:05:01.940> to<00:05:02.000> the<00:05:02.180> volume

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:02.539 
and then and then we get to the volume

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:04.110 
and then and then we get to the volume
knob<00:05:02.720> which<00:05:02.990> is

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
knob which is

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:09.029 
knob which is
controls<00:05:05.120> the<00:05:05.300> voice<00:05:06.639> the<00:05:07.639> wild<00:05:08.000> thing<00:05:08.210> here

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.039 
controls the voice the wild thing here

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:15.510 
controls the voice the wild thing here
is<00:05:10.120> um<00:05:11.379> it's<00:05:12.379> it's<00:05:12.830> got<00:05:13.099> this<00:05:13.280> switch<00:05:13.639> on<00:05:13.849> here

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
is um it's it's got this switch on here

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.860 
is um it's it's got this switch on here
what<00:05:16.520> the<00:05:16.639> switch<00:05:16.879> does<00:05:17.120> is<00:05:17.330> it<00:05:17.449> turns<00:05:17.629> the

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
what the switch does is it turns the

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:22.330 
what the switch does is it turns the
base<00:05:18.080> off<00:05:19.539> in<00:05:20.539> other<00:05:20.690> words<00:05:20.930> like<00:05:21.409> normally

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.340 
base off in other words like normally

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.059 
base off in other words like normally
you<00:05:22.990> would<00:05:23.990> you<00:05:24.139> would<00:05:24.259> get<00:05:24.379> your<00:05:24.500> game<00:05:24.770> you

00:05:25.059 --> 00:05:25.069 
you would you would get your game you

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:27.399 
you would you would get your game you
play<00:05:25.430> and<00:05:25.729> then<00:05:25.849> you're<00:05:25.970> done<00:05:26.210> you<00:05:27.020> just<00:05:27.050> pull

00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:27.409 
play and then you're done you just pull

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:30.339 
play and then you're done you just pull
your<00:05:27.500> jack<00:05:27.770> out<00:05:28.009> and<00:05:28.280> you're<00:05:29.240> done<00:05:29.449> the

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:30.349 
your jack out and you're done the

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:33.850 
your jack out and you're done the
battery<00:05:30.740> has<00:05:30.919> been<00:05:31.159> uh<00:05:31.699> turned<00:05:32.389> off<00:05:32.659> or<00:05:33.380> is

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
battery has been uh turned off or is

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.469 
battery has been uh turned off or is
removed<00:05:34.280> from<00:05:34.400> the<00:05:34.550> circuit<00:05:34.759> because<00:05:35.330> the

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:35.479 
removed from the circuit because the

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:39.100 
removed from the circuit because the
ground<00:05:35.659> is<00:05:35.960> growing<00:05:36.740> but<00:05:37.400> in<00:05:37.789> this<00:05:37.970> case<00:05:38.210> the

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
ground is growing but in this case the

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.550 
ground is growing but in this case the
battery<00:05:39.470> in<00:05:39.740> this<00:05:39.919> base<00:05:40.099> is<00:05:40.310> still<00:05:40.520> on<00:05:40.900> so<00:05:41.900> you

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 
battery in this base is still on so you

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.890 
battery in this base is still on so you
turn<00:05:42.860> the<00:05:42.979> knob<00:05:43.009> volume<00:05:43.940> up<00:05:44.090> all<00:05:44.330> the<00:05:44.569> way<00:05:44.690> down

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:44.900 
turn the knob volume up all the way down

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.680 
turn the knob volume up all the way down
and<00:05:45.169> then<00:05:45.349> click<00:05:46.340> make<00:05:46.849> a<00:05:46.909> click<00:05:47.210> and<00:05:47.449> it<00:05:47.539> would

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:47.690 
and then click make a click and it would

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.170 
and then click make a click and it would
turn<00:05:47.870> the<00:05:48.020> base<00:05:48.139> off<00:05:48.409> I<00:05:48.770> can't<00:05:49.699> tell<00:05:49.909> you<00:05:50.030> how

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 
turn the base off I can't tell you how

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.870 
turn the base off I can't tell you how
many<00:05:50.240> times<00:05:50.630> I've<00:05:50.990> come<00:05:51.259> to<00:05:51.380> my<00:05:51.500> game<00:05:51.789> you<00:05:52.789> know

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 
many times I've come to my game you know
