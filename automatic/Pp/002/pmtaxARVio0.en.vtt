00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.280 
was able to play my best and come up on
top<00:01:18.490> it's<00:01:19.000> your<00:01:19.090> ZBZ<00:01:19.390> usually<00:01:19.750> that<00:01:19.870> strong<00:01:20.140> I

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
top it's your ZBZ usually that strong I

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.620 
top it's your ZBZ usually that strong I
mean<00:01:20.410> what<00:01:20.530> was<00:01:20.680> it<00:01:20.860> about<00:01:20.950> that<00:01:21.850> series<00:01:22.240> yeah

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
mean what was it about that series yeah

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.360 
mean what was it about that series yeah
I<00:01:22.690> think<00:01:22.810> CBC<00:01:23.290> is<00:01:23.320> my<00:01:23.470> best<00:01:23.620> matchup<00:01:23.950> for<00:01:24.220> sure

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:24.370 
I think CBC is my best matchup for sure

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.340 
I think CBC is my best matchup for sure
wait<00:01:24.940> what<00:01:25.240> about<00:01:25.330> zvz<00:01:25.720> makes<00:01:26.020> it<00:01:26.170> your

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
wait what about zvz makes it your

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.860 
wait what about zvz makes it your
strongest<00:01:26.650> matchup<00:01:26.980> I<00:01:27.160> guess<00:01:28.060> on<00:01:28.600> Europe

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:28.870 
strongest matchup I guess on Europe

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.960 
strongest matchup I guess on Europe
there's<00:01:29.110> like<00:01:29.320> 10<00:01:30.160> times<00:01:30.370> more<00:01:30.460> circus<00:01:30.880> and

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
there's like 10 times more circus and

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.180 
there's like 10 times more circus and
the<00:01:31.000> other<00:01:31.180> races<00:01:31.480> so<00:01:31.660> this<00:01:32.560> comes<00:01:32.800> natural

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
the other races so this comes natural

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.610 
the other races so this comes natural
what's<00:01:33.790> your<00:01:33.940> weakest<00:01:34.180> matchup<00:01:34.510> I'm<00:01:35.320> probably

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:35.620 
what's your weakest matchup I'm probably

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.890 
what's your weakest matchup I'm probably
vs<00:01:36.010> 10<00:01:36.220> because<00:01:36.670> there's<00:01:37.000> so<00:01:37.330> few<00:01:37.360> tears<00:01:37.720> on

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
vs 10 because there's so few tears on

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.810 
vs 10 because there's so few tears on
the<00:01:37.930> Europe<00:01:38.140> ladder<00:01:38.350> and<00:01:38.740> your<00:01:39.400> new<00:01:39.490> European
