00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 the dotcom woman program defeat and her 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:08.820
 is back now to micro and machico 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.160
 With us, every good friend is welcome. 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.170
 turned on and receiving these people too. 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.269
 found a tip that I love know 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.279
 now that it was digital, right? 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.650
 but it's not the same thing see photo on 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.869
 computer on the cell phone sometimes loses 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.939
 I 've lost everything I do not know how 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.220
 So we have to leave 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.680
 It's all safe because it's worth it. 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.330
 They live very tasty and then 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.790
 until we enjoy showing before people 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.690
 start the step-by-step Sunday 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.690
 brought some suggestions 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.739
 is so beautiful right in mico then that is 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:45.000
 the vintage style in the then I made with my 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:47.070
 aged paper and rose 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.670
 so what I found cool touch that 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.649
 this material already exists all trimmed 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.289
 right and is called canopy does not roll has been 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.920
 trimmed is only you decorating your paper is 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:02.789
 that young then cut out this drawing 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.040
 Well, it was a ball that was born from here, right? 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.880
 people will start in another block shows 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.880
 other options 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:17.340
 so that's a square, that 's how we are 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.080
 go make an album yourself make a 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.090
 present ne 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.820
 like you said on the internet it's so easy 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.340
 Take a picture now, there we are. 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.280
 It prints all that can make a good 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.439
 beautiful surprise in the purse 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.570
 now how did you set up the 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:37.710
 We're a cardboard, come on, come on. 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:41.009
 No, I brought it to you so he is 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.710
 to win six pieces of this certain then 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.020
 I need to be higher, right? 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.970
 when we use discrete paper 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.990
 so I cut it here 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.680
 But this curvature is very annoying. 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.189
 cut right 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:02:00.060
 It's what I'm going to do, I'm going to spend there 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:02.610
 glue here're glue scrap is also 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.990
 This type of glue is ideal because 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.460
 something we keep for a long time. 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.069
 Time, right? 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.899
 then it is a glue itself not yellow only 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.860
 you are feet 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.110
 so as a rolled-up too 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.180
 streamlines and stays all the uniform the glue 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.600
 important and ethical 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:25.780
 scrapbooking it's here O 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.780
 I'm going to cross the line 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:38.260
 I spoke well then I'll take advantage of this 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:43.030
 other landscape drawing her down here 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:44.860
 to the inverter bringing here we have 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.310
 to think that we will for photo right 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:52.080
 then you have to have a free area too 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.080
 for a photo 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:58.690
 so you put that discrete paper 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:00.850
 Because it takes a little while to dry. 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:05.040
 for her the right has to press a 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:09.100
 A little wait a few minutes 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:12.280
 my role is a collection of four 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.580
 roles that one combines with the other then 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.620
 with my papers you can do 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.640
 pages that combine with each other 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:23.140
 OK 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:25.870
 and here I'll come with stylus 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:30.690
 the ideal is logical to expect to dry, I will not 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.690
 show that it's not so difficult 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:47.799
 the album is already going to give a support you cut 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:52.830
 Even this is not always straight with the way 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:57.820
 with patience will you be able to cut 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:59.980
 now even cut it all down is six pages is 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.480
 so I would give some work that I did 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:06.130
 so here 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:09.340
 This is a release, too. 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:15.280
 there are adhesive tapes that match the 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:17.530
 my role is so she's aggressive then 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.970
 here, for example, imagine this furinho 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:23.400
 you have to cut 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:26.550
 so I'll apply this tape as it stands 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:32.189
 easy and beautiful, right? 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:36.099
 I've already been rolling the other side 

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:37.960
 stretching forth love it here already 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:41.710
 Are you going to have the part? 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:44.409
 It's just for show here It's already tightened. 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:49.719
 the mark appears to me spend one 

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:53.409
 stylus to shorten it becomes easier to 

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:55.409
 cut and finish this by 

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:58.029
 he is here too 

00:04:55.409 --> 00:05:03.509
 this curve is very annoying to cut the 

00:04:58.029 --> 00:05:03.509
 The paper I 'm going to make, I 'm going to use the ribbon. 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:25.569
 iacc this one is already much easier to 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:32.819
 People cut that little ball you go 

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:32.819
 cover both sides and stay here too 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:41.560
 is this is also with the tape 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:45.089
 the sample is just the same and here it is already 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.089
 I will spend another tip here is cool 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:51.250
 has that harmony is that so a 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:54.969
 van in the face, right? 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:57.520
 then those are only 10 that combine are 

00:05:54.969 --> 00:06:01.629
 all white roses 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:07.330
 the gray tone is here is also a role 

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:09.580
 and here the tape is that this is a page to 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.629
 bag that I made that I'll explain more 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:14.139
 forward 

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:16.210
 So you saw how easy it was then I 

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:17.649
 I enjoyed that there is a route down here 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:20.819
 I put the rose 

00:06:17.649 --> 00:06:26.229
 here is a space for me was a photo 

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:29.819
 And there and there are the roles here are the taxi 

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:31.240
 JosÃ© is one that combines with the other 

00:06:29.819 --> 00:06:34.479
 language 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:36.249
 Look beyond these four options you have 

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:40.809
 an inside back 

00:06:36.249 --> 00:06:44.499
 it's different then you give it to you 

00:06:40.809 --> 00:06:48.459
 do a job well then, right? 

00:06:44.499 --> 00:06:51.719
 but the best of all collections you have 

00:06:48.459 --> 00:06:55.269
 four roles that the male combines are so 

00:06:51.719 --> 00:06:59.739
 repetitive sticking on the 6th afternoon there is 

00:06:55.269 --> 00:07:02.799
 here then I'll show you some ideas 

00:06:59.739 --> 00:07:04.299
 suggestions for you to decorate now then 

00:07:02.799 --> 00:07:07.049
 here I've done everything the way I did 

00:07:04.299 --> 00:07:13.259
 a past role 

00:07:07.049 --> 00:07:16.959
 I cut the battle of the Mourinho 

00:07:13.259 --> 00:07:20.729
 There's a tool he sews on. 

00:07:16.959 --> 00:07:26.589
 one thing that has pointed out that you come 

00:07:20.729 --> 00:07:29.199
 You 'll open there and you'll get one. 

00:07:26.589 --> 00:07:36.719
 pointed scissors he expects her to me 

00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:40.029
 Send me a nice little snip, right? 

00:07:36.719 --> 00:07:41.979
 so now I go so let's say that 

00:07:40.029 --> 00:07:43.989
 we have made every page the work of 

00:07:41.979 --> 00:07:45.610
 heart to heart then declare in the 

00:07:43.989 --> 00:07:47.679
 next block let us leaves 

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:48.639
 house or staff that taste of 

00:07:47.679 --> 00:07:50.139
 I want more 

00:07:48.639 --> 00:07:52.769
 the break soon we vote in 

00:07:50.139 --> 00:07:52.769
 sequence
