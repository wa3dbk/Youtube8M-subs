00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
any car needs to a drive-by which is

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.420 
any car needs to a drive-by which is
basically<00:00:51.960> look<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.500> left<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:52.949> right<00:00:53.190> and

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
basically look to left and right and

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.340 
basically look to left and right and
press<00:00:53.610> fire<00:00:53.940> we<00:00:54.329> need<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.629> try<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:54.960> kill<00:00:55.199> as

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
press fire we need to try and kill as

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.920 
press fire we need to try and kill as
many<00:00:55.500> guys<00:00:56.399> or<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.730> purple<00:00:57.120> t-shirts<00:00:57.570> as<00:00:57.780> we

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
many guys or the purple t-shirts as we

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.349 
many guys or the purple t-shirts as we
can<00:00:58.199> exactly<00:00:58.980> doing<00:00:59.399> this<00:00:59.579> map<00:00:59.820> that<00:01:00.000> we<00:01:00.120> can't

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
can exactly doing this map that we can't

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.420 
can exactly doing this map that we can't
run<00:01:00.570> them<00:01:00.690> over<00:01:00.960> or<00:01:01.050> anything<00:01:01.430> that's

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.640 
run them over or anything that's
basically<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.910> drive-by<00:01:03.210> as<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.290> can<00:01:04.379> see<00:01:04.530> the

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
basically a drive-by as you can see the

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.500 
basically a drive-by as you can see the
problem<00:01:05.010> is<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.460> red<00:01:05.640> Jack's<00:01:05.909> feel<00:01:06.270> you're

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
problem is the red Jack's feel you're

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.240 
problem is the red Jack's feel you're
trying<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:06.810> kill<00:01:06.990> them<00:01:07.170> as<00:01:07.260> well<00:01:07.439> so<00:01:07.470> if<00:01:08.010> they

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
trying to kill them as well so if they

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.649 
trying to kill them as well so if they
react<00:01:08.640> badly<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.450> so<00:01:10.340> best<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.490> luck<00:01:11.549> it's<00:01:12.450> not

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
react badly to so best of luck it's not

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.660 
react badly to so best of luck it's not
too<00:01:12.869> difficult<00:01:13.110> keep<00:01:13.799> driving<00:01:14.159> around<00:01:14.280> and

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
too difficult keep driving around and

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.499 
too difficult keep driving around and
I'm<00:01:14.760> sure<00:01:14.970> we'd<00:01:15.119> be<00:01:15.180> fine<00:01:16.970> however<00:01:17.970> if<00:01:18.360> you

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
I'm sure we'd be fine however if you

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.270 
I'm sure we'd be fine however if you
have<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.810> purple<00:01:19.049> mines<00:01:19.409> glitch<00:01:19.740> you're<00:01:20.040> not

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
have the purple mines glitch you're not

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.060 
have the purple mines glitch you're not
be<00:01:20.430> able<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.640> pass<00:01:20.850> this<00:01:21.030> mission<00:01:21.450> so<00:01:22.350> I<00:01:22.799> hope

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
be able to pass this mission so I hope

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.030 
be able to pass this mission so I hope
to<00:01:23.430> hell<00:01:23.610> that<00:01:23.640> that<00:01:24.090> kind<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.509> happens<00:01:25.040> thing

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
to hell that that kind of happens thing

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.920 
to hell that that kind of happens thing
is<00:01:26.189> you<00:01:26.340> can<00:01:26.520> avoid<00:01:26.790> without<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.390> mines<00:01:27.600> clips

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
is you can avoid without the mines clips

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.350 
is you can avoid without the mines clips
if<00:01:28.110> you're<00:01:28.290> cautious

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
if you're cautious

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.930 
if you're cautious
you<00:01:30.780> have<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.140> basically<00:01:31.350> kind<00:01:31.980> of<00:01:32.070> I<00:01:32.400> don't

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
you have to basically kind of I don't

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.400 
you have to basically kind of I don't
think<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.300> happens<00:01:33.630> with<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.870> Xbox<00:01:34.290> version

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:34.410 
think it happens with the Xbox version

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.650 
think it happens with the Xbox version
but<00:01:34.860> I've<00:01:34.950> heard<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.340> happens<00:01:35.700> with<00:01:35.910> the<00:01:36.120> ps2

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:36.660 
but I've heard it happens with the ps2

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.410 
but I've heard it happens with the ps2
version<00:01:36.690> most<00:01:37.590> of<00:01:37.890> most<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.400> time<00:01:38.640> it's

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
version most of most of the time it's

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.720 
version most of most of the time it's
the<00:01:39.510> slot<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.230> you<00:01:40.260> have<00:01:40.440> to<00:01:40.710> UM<00:01:40.920> watch<00:01:41.460> out

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:41.730 
the slot that you have to UM watch out

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.610 
the slot that you have to UM watch out
for<00:01:42.000> if<00:01:42.390> you've<00:01:42.600> beaten<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:43.080> game<00:01:43.260> on<00:01:43.470> one

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:43.620 
for if you've beaten the game on one

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.440 
for if you've beaten the game on one
slot<00:01:43.980> and<00:01:44.250> then<00:01:44.340> you<00:01:44.490> start<00:01:44.760> a<00:01:44.880> new<00:01:45.060> game<00:01:45.300> on

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
slot and then you start a new game on

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.600 
slot and then you start a new game on
that<00:01:45.570> slot<00:01:45.840> without<00:01:46.560> actually<00:01:46.920> resetting<00:01:47.490> the

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
that slot without actually resetting the

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.150 
that slot without actually resetting the
slot<00:01:47.880> or<00:01:48.350> taking<00:01:49.350> like<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.500> memory<00:01:49.800> card<00:01:49.979> out

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.160 
slot or taking like a memory card out

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.460 
slot or taking like a memory card out
first<00:01:50.550> and<00:01:51.210> you're<00:01:51.450> likely<00:01:51.690> to<00:01:51.900> get<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.170> glitch

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
first and you're likely to get a glitch

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.310 
first and you're likely to get a glitch
back<00:01:52.800> again<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.880> could<00:01:54.030> always<00:01:54.150> use<00:01:54.479> a<00:01:54.690> flying

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
back again you could always use a flying

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.260 
back again you could always use a flying
car<00:01:55.590> cheat<00:01:55.830> there<00:01:56.340> at<00:01:56.430> your<00:01:56.670> site<00:01:56.880> down<00:01:57.030> and

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
car cheat there at your site down and

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.020 
car cheat there at your site down and
check<00:01:57.510> if<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:59.070> lines<00:01:59.310> are<00:01:59.490> there<00:01:59.640> and<00:01:59.760> if<00:01:59.850> they

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
check if the lines are there and if they

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.760 
check if the lines are there and if they
are<00:02:00.180> then<00:02:00.479> you<00:02:00.570> could<00:02:00.720> reload<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.170> game<00:02:01.410> and

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
are then you could reload the game and

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.070 
are then you could reload the game and
then<00:02:02.310> you'll<00:02:02.729> know<00:02:02.970> it's<00:02:03.119> a<00:02:03.180> safe<00:02:03.390> file<00:02:03.720> to

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
then you'll know it's a safe file to

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.910 
then you'll know it's a safe file to
play<00:02:04.470> on

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
play on
