00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.139 

we've<00:00:01.620> already<00:00:01.829> seen<00:00:02.159> this<00:00:02.340> pedigree<00:00:02.730> and<00:00:03.030> we

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
we've already seen this pedigree and we

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.309 
we've already seen this pedigree and we
analyzed<00:00:03.810> it<00:00:04.080> using<00:00:05.629> sort<00:00:06.629> of<00:00:06.660> a<00:00:06.750> brute<00:00:06.990> force

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
analyzed it using sort of a brute force

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.440 
analyzed it using sort of a brute force
method<00:00:07.560> as<00:00:07.859> I'm<00:00:07.980> calling<00:00:08.309> it<00:00:08.429> by<00:00:08.580> determining

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
method as I'm calling it by determining

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.900 
method as I'm calling it by determining
gene<00:00:09.750> symbols<00:00:10.290> and<00:00:10.559> checking<00:00:10.920> through<00:00:11.670> the

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
gene symbols and checking through the

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.509 
gene symbols and checking through the
inheritance<00:00:12.599> so<00:00:13.290> what<00:00:13.650> I<00:00:13.679> want<00:00:13.860> to<00:00:13.920> do<00:00:14.009> now<00:00:14.190> is

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
inheritance so what I want to do now is

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.990 
inheritance so what I want to do now is
the<00:00:15.420> same<00:00:15.660> kind<00:00:16.049> of<00:00:16.230> thing<00:00:16.470> but<00:00:17.279> now<00:00:17.520> I<00:00:17.550> want<00:00:17.880> to

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
the same kind of thing but now I want to

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.750 
the same kind of thing but now I want to
look<00:00:18.150> at<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.539> possibility<00:00:19.230> of<00:00:19.760> x-linked

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
look at the possibility of x-linked

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.529 
look at the possibility of x-linked
traits<00:00:21.180> we<00:00:21.810> already<00:00:22.170> determined<00:00:22.859> that

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:23.539 
traits we already determined that

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.960 
traits we already determined that
autosomal<00:00:24.539> e<00:00:24.660> this<00:00:25.470> supports<00:00:26.160> only<00:00:26.760> a

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
autosomal e this supports only a

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.820 
autosomal e this supports only a
recessive<00:00:27.570> inheritance<00:00:27.660> pattern<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:28.619> if<00:00:28.710> you

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
recessive inheritance pattern and if you

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.700 
recessive inheritance pattern and if you
recall<00:00:29.160> it<00:00:29.609> was<00:00:29.789> these<00:00:30.090> parents<00:00:30.660> here<00:00:31.080> giving

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
recall it was these parents here giving

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.400 
recall it was these parents here giving
rise<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:31.920> affected<00:00:32.820> children<00:00:33.270> here<00:00:33.690> that<00:00:34.170> told

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
rise to affected children here that told

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.639 
rise to affected children here that told
us<00:00:34.620> it<00:00:34.920> must<00:00:35.250> be<00:00:35.670> recessive<00:00:36.360> well<00:00:37.260> let's<00:00:37.440> see

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
us it must be recessive well let's see

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.490 
us it must be recessive well let's see
if<00:00:37.890> this<00:00:38.160> would<00:00:38.370> work<00:00:38.430> as<00:00:38.940> an<00:00:39.390> x-linked<00:00:40.350> trait

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
if this would work as an x-linked trait

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.569 
if this would work as an x-linked trait
so<00:00:41.399> again<00:00:42.120> with<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.510> brute<00:00:42.840> force<00:00:42.870> method

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 
so again with the brute force method

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:46.430 
so again with the brute force method
let's<00:00:44.579> define<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.840> gene<00:00:46.079> on<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.289> X

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
let's define the gene on the X

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.940 
let's define the gene on the X
chromosome<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.550> let's<00:00:48.420> say<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:48.860> since<00:00:49.860> we

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
chromosome and let's say that since we

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.920 
chromosome and let's say that since we
already<00:00:50.070> know<00:00:50.190> it's<00:00:50.399> recessive<00:00:50.730> I'm<00:00:51.719> gonna

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
already know it's recessive I'm gonna

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.279 
already know it's recessive I'm gonna
call<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.320> X<00:00:52.559> R<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.520> that<00:00:54.120> means<00:00:54.390> you'd<00:00:55.260> be

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
call it X R and that means you'd be

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.319 
call it X R and that means you'd be
affected<00:00:56.149> it's<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.239> recessive<00:00:57.739> disorder

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
affected it's a recessive disorder

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:02.750 
affected it's a recessive disorder
affected<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.570> if<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:01.710> are<00:01:01.829> X<00:01:02.039> capital<00:01:02.520> R

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
affected and if you are X capital R

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.370 
affected and if you are X capital R
that's<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.600> dominant<00:01:04.070> normal<00:01:05.540> phenotype<00:01:06.540> now

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
that's the dominant normal phenotype now

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.399 
that's the dominant normal phenotype now
in<00:01:07.560> order<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.830> show<00:01:07.950> this<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.610> must<00:01:08.820> be<00:01:08.909> either

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
in order to show this you must be either

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:11.660 
in order to show this you must be either
homozygous<00:01:10.409> recessive<00:01:10.979> or<00:01:11.100> if<00:01:11.250> you're<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.400> male

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
homozygous recessive or if you're a male

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.679 
homozygous recessive or if you're a male
you<00:01:11.970> could<00:01:12.540> be<00:01:12.689> hemizygous<00:01:14.180> okay<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:15.240> we<00:01:15.509> know

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
you could be hemizygous okay so we know

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.039 
you could be hemizygous okay so we know
for<00:01:16.020> sure<00:01:16.049> that<00:01:17.009> if<00:01:17.520> we're<00:01:18.299> going<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.780> go<00:01:18.900> with

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
for sure that if we're going to go with

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.070 
for sure that if we're going to go with
this<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.590> male<00:01:19.920> is<00:01:20.189> affected<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:20.970> he<00:01:21.810> is

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
this the male is affected and he is

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.690 
this the male is affected and he is
hemizygous<00:01:22.619> which<00:01:23.009> means<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.460> one

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
hemizygous which means that one

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.980 
hemizygous which means that one
chromosome<00:01:24.060> is<00:01:24.299> an<00:01:24.420> X<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.869> other

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
chromosome is an X and the other

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.920 
chromosome is an X and the other
chromosome<00:01:25.470> is<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.650> Y<00:01:26.090> the<00:01:27.090> female<00:01:27.570> must

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
chromosome is a Y the female must

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.120 
chromosome is a Y the female must
therefore<00:01:28.530> must<00:01:29.220> be<00:01:30.530> carrying<00:01:31.530> at<00:01:31.650> least<00:01:31.680> one

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
therefore must be carrying at least one

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.050 
therefore must be carrying at least one
wild-type<00:01:32.610> dominant<00:01:33.390> allele<00:01:33.920> and<00:01:34.920> in<00:01:35.670> order

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
wild-type dominant allele and in order

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.499 
wild-type dominant allele and in order
for<00:01:36.090> her<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.600> pass<00:01:36.840> it<00:01:37.170> on<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.710> her<00:01:38.100> son<00:01:38.509> here

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
for her to pass it on to her son here

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.649 
for her to pass it on to her son here
she'd<00:01:40.229> have<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.560> be<00:01:40.590> heterozygous<00:01:40.979> so<00:01:41.700> we're

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
she'd have to be heterozygous so we're

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.830 
she'd have to be heterozygous so we're
gonna<00:01:42.750> hypothesize<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:44.310> her<00:01:44.600> genotype<00:01:45.600> is

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
gonna hypothesize that her genotype is

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.960 
gonna hypothesize that her genotype is
that<00:01:46.290> so<00:01:47.070> she<00:01:47.250> passes<00:01:48.090> we<00:01:48.329> know<00:01:48.570> dad<00:01:49.040> over<00:01:50.040> here

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
that so she passes we know dad over here

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.410 
that so she passes we know dad over here
is<00:01:51.119> gonna<00:01:51.600> pass<00:01:51.960> his<00:01:52.500> Y<00:01:53.490> chromosome<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.240> his

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
is gonna pass his Y chromosome to his

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.060 
is gonna pass his Y chromosome to his
son<00:01:54.659> his<00:01:54.840> daughters<00:01:55.229> are<00:01:55.350> not<00:01:55.439> gonna<00:01:55.619> get<00:01:55.860> that

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
son his daughters are not gonna get that

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.700 
son his daughters are not gonna get that
so<00:01:56.460> let's<00:01:57.149> put<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.750> Y<00:01:57.899> chromosome<00:01:58.439> there

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
so let's put the Y chromosome there

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.200 
so let's put the Y chromosome there
that's<00:01:58.920> from<00:01:59.040> dad<00:01:59.219> and<00:01:59.250> that<00:01:59.520> means<00:01:59.700> from<00:01:59.909> mom

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
that's from dad and that means from mom

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.719 
that's from dad and that means from mom
the<00:02:01.020> male<00:02:01.439> has<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:01.950> get<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.250> recessive<00:02:02.579> allele

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
the male has to get the recessive allele

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.289 
the male has to get the recessive allele
so<00:02:03.090> this<00:02:03.509> fits<00:02:04.020> so<00:02:04.380> far<00:02:04.680> now<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.579> daughters

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
so this fits so far now the daughters

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.510 
so this fits so far now the daughters
are<00:02:06.570> going<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:06.930> get<00:02:07.079> from<00:02:07.229> their<00:02:07.380> mother<00:02:07.619> the

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
are going to get from their mother the

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.089 
are going to get from their mother the
dominant<00:02:09.270> capital<00:02:10.170> R<00:02:10.379> allele<00:02:10.920> because

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
dominant capital R allele because

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.130 
dominant capital R allele because
they're<00:02:11.370> not<00:02:11.580> affected<00:02:12.030> and<00:02:12.180> dad<00:02:12.660> because<00:02:13.080> he

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
they're not affected and dad because he

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.740 
they're not affected and dad because he
made<00:02:13.319> a<00:02:13.349> daughter

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
made a daughter

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.440 
made a daughter
is<00:02:14.500> going<00:02:14.740> to<00:02:14.800> give<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.250> lowercase<00:02:15.760> R<00:02:16.120> so<00:02:16.270> the

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
is going to give the lowercase R so the

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.940 
is going to give the lowercase R so the
daughters<00:02:16.720> have<00:02:16.930> to<00:02:17.050> be<00:02:17.170> heterozygous<00:02:17.410> for

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
daughters have to be heterozygous for

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.980 
daughters have to be heterozygous for
this<00:02:18.070> particular<00:02:18.910> situation<00:02:19.920> now<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:22.390> male

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
this particular situation now the male

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.410 
this particular situation now the male
coming<00:02:23.590> in<00:02:23.860> on<00:02:24.100> the<00:02:24.310> right<00:02:24.610> here

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
coming in on the right here

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.200 
coming in on the right here
he's<00:02:26.080> definitely<00:02:26.520> unaffected<00:02:27.520> so<00:02:27.790> let's<00:02:28.030> give

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
he's definitely unaffected so let's give

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.449 
he's definitely unaffected so let's give
him<00:02:28.450> the<00:02:28.690> X<00:02:28.900> capital<00:02:29.440> R<00:02:29.710> allele<00:02:30.100> and<00:02:30.340> he's

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
him the X capital R allele and he's

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.340 
him the X capital R allele and he's
gonna<00:02:30.580> have<00:02:30.760> a<00:02:30.790> y<00:02:31.000> chromosome<00:02:31.480> as<00:02:31.600> well<00:02:31.780> he's

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
gonna have a y chromosome as well he's

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.199 
gonna have a y chromosome as well he's
gonna<00:02:32.530> give<00:02:32.740> that<00:02:32.890> Y<00:02:33.040> chromosome<00:02:33.490> to<00:02:33.760> both<00:02:33.970> of

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
gonna give that Y chromosome to both of

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.870 
gonna give that Y chromosome to both of
his<00:02:34.360> sons<00:02:34.390> just<00:02:35.050> like<00:02:35.260> this<00:02:35.560> now<00:02:36.520> mom's

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
his sons just like this now mom's

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.740 
his sons just like this now mom's
heterozygous<00:02:37.630> she's<00:02:38.500> gonna<00:02:38.650> pass<00:02:38.890> on<00:02:39.750> one

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
heterozygous she's gonna pass on one

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.060 
heterozygous she's gonna pass on one
allele<00:02:40.990> or<00:02:41.140> the<00:02:41.200> other<00:02:41.350> she<00:02:41.560> could<00:02:41.740> pass<00:02:41.890> on

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
allele or the other she could pass on

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.570 
allele or the other she could pass on
the<00:02:42.250> recessive<00:02:42.610> X<00:02:43.030> to<00:02:43.690> her<00:02:43.870> son<00:02:44.140> here<00:02:44.830> and<00:02:45.010> she

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
the recessive X to her son here and she

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.940 
the recessive X to her son here and she
could<00:02:45.670> pass<00:02:45.850> her<00:02:45.910> dominant<00:02:46.600> one<00:02:46.810> to<00:02:47.170> her<00:02:47.410> son

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
could pass her dominant one to her son

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.400 
could pass her dominant one to her son
there<00:02:48.370> now<00:02:48.970> for<00:02:49.030> this<00:02:49.600> daughter<00:02:49.900> she's<00:02:50.260> going

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
there now for this daughter she's going

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.550 
there now for this daughter she's going
to<00:02:50.470> get<00:02:50.620> an<00:02:50.800> X<00:02:51.040> capital<00:02:51.670> R<00:02:51.820> from<00:02:52.120> dad<00:02:52.390> and<00:02:52.870> this

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
to get an X capital R from dad and this

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.100 
to get an X capital R from dad and this
other<00:02:53.739> daughter<00:02:54.040> right<00:02:54.340> here<00:02:54.880> has<00:02:55.420> to<00:02:55.450> get<00:02:55.840> X

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
other daughter right here has to get X

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.490 
other daughter right here has to get X
capital<00:02:56.709> R<00:02:56.980> from<00:02:57.310> dad<00:02:57.550> now<00:02:58.480> this<00:02:59.170> is<00:02:59.350> not

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
capital R from dad now this is not

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.090 
capital R from dad now this is not
possible<00:02:59.950> to<00:03:00.270> have<00:03:01.270> the<00:03:01.720> mutant<00:03:02.650> phenotype

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
possible to have the mutant phenotype

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.500 
possible to have the mutant phenotype
and<00:03:03.280> get<00:03:04.239> the<00:03:04.800> wild-type<00:03:05.800> allele<00:03:06.010> here<00:03:06.550> so<00:03:07.030> we

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
and get the wild-type allele here so we

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.880 
and get the wild-type allele here so we
can<00:03:07.780> say<00:03:08.650> that<00:03:09.640> we<00:03:10.450> cannot<00:03:10.840> support<00:03:11.230> x-linked

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
can say that we cannot support x-linked

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.650 
can say that we cannot support x-linked
inheritance<00:03:12.060> we're<00:03:13.060> not<00:03:13.180> even<00:03:13.390> going<00:03:13.510> to

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
inheritance we're not even going to

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.490 
inheritance we're not even going to
explore<00:03:13.959> dominant<00:03:14.470> inheritance<00:03:15.090> because<00:03:16.500> the

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
explore dominant inheritance because the

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:18.900 
explore dominant inheritance because the
pedigree<00:03:17.799> already<00:03:18.070> shows<00:03:18.220> that<00:03:18.430> it<00:03:18.519> has<00:03:18.640> to<00:03:18.790> be

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
pedigree already shows that it has to be

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.390 
pedigree already shows that it has to be
recessive
