00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:01.160
 the Fernando 

00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:04.490
 what motivates you to the Turkish city of soccer in May that with so many 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.570
 scandals these provocations both the fans and the clubs 

00:00:10.159 --> 00:00:11.290
 that's what motivates 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.669
 It really is a passion for football, right? 

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:18.580
 it is from them that action has always admired football as not just as a sport 

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:20.300
 but rather as a martyr said 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.699
 and I think it has to be valued not only by the players but who does 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:28.540
 part then I think it's the biggest difficulty for a habit I think 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:29.050
 is 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.699
 during the course 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.610
 are these technÃ© both theoretical test york the physical test that is a 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.890
 the process the physical test is too much too big city 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.830
 so if you do not serve really prepared yes percent and fit for 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.560
 to act without injuries is certainly what 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.539
 throughout the career 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:51.460
 It's what's going to hurt 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.380
 everyone knows that the fans get on the referees' feet and end up often 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.780
 including let's say their mother placements 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.510
 will change be dealing with it? 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.510
 with that I certainly feel prominent 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.120
 this recognition 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.120
 understood how important it is that he is doing a good job 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.170
 and I would say that the css was very complicated the saints was winning so 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.920
 ready wings still 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.850
 because it was backwards but then I win is another was a goal that is 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.130
 cheat test 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.300
 I do not think that I killed the son. 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.300
 very scared but in the end it worked out 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.440
 so what I would like to say the following is 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.420
 in the first game bid 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.830
 we have said that the passion for football just as I have and many have none 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.600
 destruction is enough for financial value alone. 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.830
 the steering wheel was submitted nicely exactly have a cost 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.310
 to be acting as a professional agent 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.570
 and I think it's not in your life 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.520
 it's worth getting what you want I think it's worth investing in 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.800
 career so I came without any shine 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.870
 tarso sonar of iranildes 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:05.320
 let's go
