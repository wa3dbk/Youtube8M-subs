00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:08.100
 very good to everyone in the video les 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.380
 I will teach how to enter the servers 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.000
 of the hunger games as you see then 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.400
 I am in the 0.1 point version 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.080
 five down here and then the first thing that 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.740
 they have to do is have their name 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.859
 user 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.960
 that has is fundamental is worth then 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.320
 as they put it, they come here to 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.390
 adjustments and who tells her name here and 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.849
 here they put their name here in this 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.329
 space where they see this icon that goes 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.489
 passing vale and only they put efe and the rest 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.070
 they leave it like you here in 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.050
 remote viewing I would 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.760
 I recommend that positions be given and their 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.420
 devices equal mine so they 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.910
 3 appears 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.159
 away in the middle one so that 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:51.960
 do not create them or something like that 

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:51.960
 well now they are going to play 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:57.640
 and this is where Edith says up here 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:00.210
 they stay there as they see and they give it where it says 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.550
 external 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.619
 Well , when they do something, they got 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.799
 all these steps will send you to this 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.540
 more or less interface so good what 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.020
 we are interested is here where it says android 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.540
 here here where they see this they touch it 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.800
 you and it will show you something more or less 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:22.530
 here something like that and erase everything and put 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:26.330
 the ip that would be the one that I would leave them in 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:30.080
 the description wait with what would be 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.080
 this and others 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.300
 I'm going to put this one because I can 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.600
 of memory 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:39.540
 as you can see there is the ip and a server 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.210
 the name of the server server 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.310
 put the name that you want and you 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.220
 I'm going to put 3g and someone tells you 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.780
 this is left as it is already after 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.430
 They give here where it says Server 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.060
 they touch it and as I come here we 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:58.610
 would appear here is the good server 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.940
 I'm going to enter the server but before 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.740
 I'm going to go give 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.600
 that is to say the one that if it does not let me 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.010
 enter is a grace of minecraft by 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.479
 the number of people who are 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.270
 trying to enter at the same time 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:14.150
 because the servers but they have 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:17.270
 space for 60 people I think 60 or 30 or 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.440
 2012 but because of that and also that there are 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.810
 a bit of the change 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:24.220
 So, as you see, here is the 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.220
 server let's go 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:33.390
 we are locating server we are going to enter 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.920
 ok as you see it is not loading it says 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.840
 building the rain that is loading 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.690
 and I'm going to show you how this is friends 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.090
 for you to realize 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:48.410
 I can seem to you if I already notice them 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:50.630
 so do not be alarmed if it's worth 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.370
 now here I am good is saying no 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.190
 be alarmed if I do not let you in 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.590
 continue and keep trying to leave them 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.120
 come in I know he's going to leave you letters 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.830
 sunsets and slopes 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.290
 I'm lucky here he let me in 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.610
 the first but as you can see here I am 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.510
 on the server 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.510
 we expect low volume 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:19.610
 good as you see I apologize before 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:22.160
 of everything if the resolution is wrong 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.200
 what s g 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.390
 as you see when you enter 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.280
 disappear something like that says that I 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.580
 register with the account but I do not 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.650
 can register good but they have 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.670
 what to do is to come towards the posters 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.760
 of these 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:41.360
 and look for a single one like this one that says 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.360
 cone 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.970
 now all are full only for 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:51.070
 beats and the highs are going 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:54.940
 in progress and everything like that but nothing 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:56.980

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.920
