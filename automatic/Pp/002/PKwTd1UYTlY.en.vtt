00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.759
 hello how are you welcome to my mac mx 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.889
 I'm mario and today we're going to talk 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.960
 of two apps one is called app of the day and 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.550
 the other free apps the two are 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.320
 free are entertainment and 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.930
 lifestyle are for iphone and ipod 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.310
 touch and they are in several languages â€‹â€‹and what 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.279
 you can upload directly from the app 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.220
 good store in this case these two 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.080
 applications have a lot of difference the 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.320
 first the one that we are going to enter is app of the 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.329
 day this application is only one 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.370
 single application per day as it says 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.800
 has a determined time for example 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.320
 who says he has 15 hours 29 minutes and 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.520
 so many seconds for you to be able to 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.010
 through facebook pass it to your 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.390
 colleagues by email and that 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.040
 they can also download it for free 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.510
 at the moment you give it for free 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.920
 you only give the green button that is 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.750
 on the top and he directly 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.489
 it sends you the absorbs and you can 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.350
 uninstall it without any problem in the 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:01.720
 part of above appears a little pig that 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.739
 has two points 98 dollars that what 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.780
 shows you is everything you 've been 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.570
 economizing then on the part of 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.509
 down if you can go see other 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.369
 applications that you can enter and weigh 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:14.650
 and that still mark already 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:15.970
 expired there are some that still for 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.930
 Look, we're going to give you up here 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.990
 store 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:22.149
 we press and that some are still 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.369
 Free time is not more than 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:26.590
 you good to try and see if still the 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.240
 they can download then they realize 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.369
 everything is to say being free then 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.009
 this app of the day app the only thing 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.960
 what it does is that it is a single apps that is 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:36.369
 which is at that moment to be able 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.110
 download that is what they 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.690
 commit to this during all that 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.700
 time is the distributor and the rest 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.229
 some of them are already paid for 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.149
 you have to pay what they are worth and other 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:49.149
 well you can continue this trying 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:51.070
 see if it works this is app of the day the 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:53.170
 next it's called free app 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.700
 the difference of this one with the other one is that 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.890
 here really 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.049
 shows you much more than 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.670
 only one is to say what they 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.409
 they are found to be free 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.729
 automatically break it down in the can 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.649
 send the difference with them you can 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.869
 send by mail so your friends 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.849
 can enter and can download 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.440
 also directly from this link 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:13.209
 download for free you give a click you 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.069
 send the app store and you can download it 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.590
 no problems at the bottom 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:20.680
 you check more apps that the 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.019
 program and go in to see if you can 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.060
 download them as they are expired by 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:27.640
 example this one that says green drink let's go 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.010
 to give author what I like is that you 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.349
 clearly explain the application the 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.290
 Most are from people who are barely 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:36.940
 well here it already costs then those that 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.769
 already expire here in free apps wants 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.660
 say that they do not work anymore but there 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:42.400
 some that you can go drying in the 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.680
 top part the advantage is that if you 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.390
 one click automatically changes the 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.130
 information and you can see if it suits you 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.079
 download it or not I recommend them something 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.480
 download them is not also after 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:53.709
 You can remove them from your iTunes and already 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.030
 you have saved because then the 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.860
 they charge and they modify it and good 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.350
 doing the best I've had the 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.850
 opportunity for example there is a 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.340
 application that is called more 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.710
 ma instant album that really 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.870
 improving a lot was free right now 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.250
 they are already charging for it but good if 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.840
 you can download it and then with the 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.850
 improvements you're getting more 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.860
 applications then it is not superfluous 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.850

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.620
