00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420
 good 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:13.369
 hello very good others I do not bring a new 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.049
 reality floor of this series and good 

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:16.940
 I'm supposed to teach it with pleasure 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:19.490
 if the house wants to be measured also as 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.140
 I was waiting but then the steps too 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.120
 done the first step see the photos 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.640
 fixedly and take out all the materials 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.440
 that you think you are going to need in 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.210
 my case now see the picture on the screen 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:33.460
 that supposedly had to build 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.290
 is the video in fast camera in this 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.120
 comment but later told truth 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.640
 added fast camera because if it's not going to 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.260
 last much better 14 minutes to do it 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.870
 so they're not going to take that long either 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:47.650
 in making one in this house but step 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:50.470
 has to from more down up 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.300
 if they have been counted there is like a 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:56.640
 parking so to speak then 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:59.410
 they have to calculate what they do 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.360
 the spaces they need for example 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.880
 have to imagine in the house of the 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.560
 real photo is minecraft and you are 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.980
 imagine the blocks and tell and peace 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.540
 and do the good thing and I did the staircase 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.190
 that way because it was long 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.460
 stairs because they put the other one was going to 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.960
 be a little girl and then added this 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.670
 I recommend you take things off by 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.830
 inside first build the house as you 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.360
 it's the picture after they add the roof and 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.330
 all those things because that what I do 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.640
 in the video then good as there 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.770
 added that and in some parts I was wrong 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.720
 that's how I was wrong because people 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.750
 you can make a mistake but then as one and 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.940
 he added that thing and then I put the wool 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.190
 white because that's how the good house looked 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.680
 the mistake I had to make the house was 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.420
 that I stay very 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.570
 had it a little bit longer for 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.190
 the left and do better 6 by just 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.760
 glass 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:53.650
 and calculate and put the glasses 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.960
 and this does not add to it as 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.000
 you have to go to the position where 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.220
 supposedly you have that house and in 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.780
 that position has to see if you're 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:06.130
 being good that you lack and blah blah blah 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:09.130
 be there I realized the picture of 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.860
 that there was a little thing in there what 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.570
 and I had to enlarge two blocks to 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.190
 the first side the big one thinking 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.530
 that was going to be able but after I gave 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.480
 mind that 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.819
 it could be had to be two 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.830
 normal that I put him fast camera if not 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:28.459
 I lose so much time now 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:31.099
 then out there and go I found the 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.750
 trick break because the photo was 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:35.840
 as what you just did not see 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.319
 been a lot of block then there I add 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:42.140
 everything and that's why one has to go 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:43.970
 calculating everything and building and doing it 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.890
 equal to the photo not to your style you have to 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.500
 do it like the photo 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.440
 and good as anahí I'm building everything 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.970
 all and a little clear that I'm going 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.760
 advancing floor by floor with there already 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.260
 I finished the first floor the second what 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.810
 first the second and now I'm going to 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.300
 build the third things that in 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.640
 actually they are like two floors but the house 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.530
 like I was up then now 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.570
 now the third part where I add him 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.910
 glass a little bit more side then 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.709
 now he had seen that there was a grate 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.390
 and if I put a block below the 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.190
 grid that I'm putting now be 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.730
 slower I put the fence area and it 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:22.120
 I saw pretty well it was good 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.709
 so 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.370
 he added the glass and he should have 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:29.010
 enlarged a little bit more 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.870
 well then that would be how the 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:35.069
 steps to build a house would have 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:37.260
 that doing it fast is the fastest way 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:40.230
 possible so they do not waste so much time 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.150
 but be quick or if not slow the 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.700
 idea is to get it right the house and 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.159
 that as you here already had already 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.540
 finished already the house then now 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:51.090
 I begin to add on the inside as one and 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.069
 I had already finished it and supposedly 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.440
 as a result of having to add a 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:56.760
 little bit stronger the left but 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.799
 then she gave me the same thing because 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.660
 he had built it whole and as in the 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:02.940
 picture would be a balcony he cited add him 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.590
 I put the register and then build all 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.330
 the house inside 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.370
 now then 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.840
 that would be after building the house 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.490
 As you can see, the photo adds all this 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.160
 thing as I am now filling in the 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:17.230
 home 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.570
 and then you add the decoration 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.810
 of decoration in the last but it 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.020
 have to worry about kinship 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.900
 in these 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:29.449
 this time the house went wrong 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:31.460
 not so bad but he went not in 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:33.830
 health so good then good maybe 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.379
 that in another video you can show him the 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.509
 well and so they learn then as a 

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:39.979
 hour I'm building the roof and I 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:41.870
 I add as a style if it is found 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:44.330
 a style happens to me 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:47.810
 to make it better then I add it 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:51.290
 that style and this would be now we are going to 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:53.510
 fill the second floor wall and that 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.830
 would be then is to say the second video 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.620
 the X's favorite good I do not answer 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:00.080
 comments for being in the south 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.780
 the idea of ​​reaching Chile for those who 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.670
 do not know then maybe I'll go 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.950
 stopping because that's how camping 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:09.380
 then I go with my family with my 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:11.420
 cousins and with my family then good 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.400
 the thing is that this will be the video if 

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:15.710
 all the favorite team of the episodes 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.000
 let me know, I'll try in the comments 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.710
 but we will not answer those that 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.820
 they arrived it 's good to see you until the 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.820
 next life to god
