00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.600 
of the phone and there are these three
slits<00:03:20.280> in<00:03:20.459> it<00:03:20.549> it<00:03:20.760> turns<00:03:21.209> out<00:03:21.739> this<00:03:22.739> is<00:03:23.010> part<00:03:23.430> of

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
slits in it it turns out this is part of

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.539 
slits in it it turns out this is part of
some<00:03:24.569> brilliant<00:03:25.140> engineering<00:03:25.650> which

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
some brilliant engineering which

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.449 
some brilliant engineering which
actually<00:03:27.200> uses<00:03:28.200> the<00:03:28.230> stainless<00:03:28.920> steel<00:03:29.129> band

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
actually uses the stainless steel band

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:37.059 
actually uses the stainless steel band
as<00:03:29.790> part<00:03:30.209> of<00:03:30.269> the<00:03:30.420> antenna<00:03:30.900> system<00:03:31.470> and<00:03:32.030> so<00:03:33.590> one

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:37.069 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:42.199 

PS<00:03:38.150> and<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.780> other<00:03:39.930> is<00:03:40.170> UMTS<00:03:40.620> and<00:03:40.769> gsm<00:03:40.980> so<00:03:41.940> it's

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
PS and the other is UMTS and gsm so it's

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.500 
PS and the other is UMTS and gsm so it's
got<00:03:42.450> these<00:03:42.959> integrated<00:03:43.590> antennas<00:03:44.340> right<00:03:45.120> in

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
got these integrated antennas right in

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.720 
got these integrated antennas right in
the<00:03:45.930> structure<00:03:46.590> of<00:03:46.620> the<00:03:46.799> phone<00:03:47.129> it's<00:03:47.370> never

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
the structure of the phone it's never

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.699 
the structure of the phone it's never
been<00:03:48.000> done<00:03:48.060> before<00:03:48.420> three<00:03:49.290> and<00:03:49.379> a<00:03:49.440> half<00:03:49.470> inches

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:54.339 
been done before three and a half inches
the<00:03:50.129> same<00:03:50.370> size<00:03:50.640> as<00:03:51.090> the<00:03:51.269> iphone<00:03:51.480> 3gs<00:03:52.790> yet<00:03:53.790> with

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
960 x 640 pixels that's four times more

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.039 
960 x 640 pixels that's four times more
pixels<00:03:59.040> than<00:03:59.190> the<00:03:59.849> iphone<00:04:00.239> gia<00:04:00.480> iphone<00:04:00.959> 3gs

326<00:04:04.049> pixels<00:04:04.230> per<00:04:04.650> inch<00:04:04.680> on<00:04:07.040> 802<00:04:08.040> one<00:04:08.310> contrast

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
326 pixels per inch on 802 one contrast

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.270 
326 pixels per inch on 802 one contrast
ratio<00:04:09.599> which<00:04:09.810> is<00:04:09.959> again<00:04:10.200> four<00:04:10.650> times<00:04:11.010> better

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
ratio which is again four times better

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.670 
ratio which is again four times better
than<00:04:11.400> the<00:04:11.669> 3gs<00:04:13.489> we're<00:04:14.489> using<00:04:14.639> IPS<00:04:15.329> technology

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
than the 3gs we're using IPS technology

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.830 
than the 3gs we're using IPS technology
this<00:04:16.680> is<00:04:16.739> a<00:04:16.950> very<00:04:17.400> advanced<00:04:18.030> LCD<00:04:18.599> technology

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
this is a very advanced LCD technology

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.229 
this is a very advanced LCD technology
which<00:04:19.769> is<00:04:19.919> quite<00:04:20.340> a<00:04:20.400> bit<00:04:20.700> in<00:04:20.729> our<00:04:21.000> opinion

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
which is quite a bit in our opinion

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:22.730 
which is quite a bit in our opinion
quite<00:04:21.630> a<00:04:21.690> bit<00:04:21.870> better<00:04:22.049> than<00:04:22.289> the<00:04:22.349> oled

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
quite a bit better than the oled

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.350 
quite a bit better than the oled
technology<00:04:22.919> for<00:04:23.490> these<00:04:23.610> types<00:04:23.849> of<00:04:23.970> products

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
technology for these types of products

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.589 
technology for these types of products
and<00:04:25.099> provides<00:04:26.099> much<00:04:26.639> more<00:04:26.910> accurate<00:04:27.330> color

00:04:27.589 --> 00:04:27.599 
and provides much more accurate color

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:31.670 
and provides much more accurate color
and<00:04:28.940> much<00:04:29.940> higher<00:04:30.180> resolution<00:04:30.900> you<00:04:31.320> can't

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
and much higher resolution you can't

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.440 
and much higher resolution you can't
make<00:04:32.010> an<00:04:32.160> oled<00:04:32.490> display<00:04:32.910> with<00:04:33.090> this<00:04:33.240> type<00:04:33.419> of

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
make an oled display with this type of

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.080 
make an oled display with this type of
resolution<00:04:33.870> right<00:04:34.289> now<00:04:34.440> and<00:04:34.680> so<00:04:35.610> we<00:04:35.820> think<00:04:35.849> the

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
resolution right now and so we think the

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.540 
resolution right now and so we think the
IPS<00:04:36.599> technology<00:04:36.810> is<00:04:37.349> really<00:04:37.740> quite<00:04:38.190> superior

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
IPS technology is really quite superior

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.219 
IPS technology is really quite superior
and<00:04:39.919> it<00:04:40.919> results<00:04:41.460> in<00:04:41.550> incredibly<00:04:42.150> sharp<00:04:42.570> text

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:43.229 
and it results in incredibly sharp text

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:46.330 
and it results in incredibly sharp text
images<00:04:44.160> and<00:04:44.430> video

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
images and video

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.400
