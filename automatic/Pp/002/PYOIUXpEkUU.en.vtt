00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:11.610
 any 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.310
 herself 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:32.900
 good today to our protein program 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:35.900
 with 8 from the company massage performance 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:39.580
 series what does it mean to know that last 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:41.120
 ruler they called performance on 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.850
 protein components 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.890
 that meant tsiferka 8 probably 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.930
 guessed it eight hours of action 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:53.360
 stretched there is this long digestible 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:55.400
 protein based as usual casein so 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:59.690
 there is also serum 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:02.420
 and dairy mix and hydrolyzate and insulation 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.040
 stretching than the classic version 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.810
 only here added of course 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.210
 enzymes so it will be very good 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.310
 digest and according to our customers 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.950
 again and it is really so very 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.020
 rarely when people say it will be bad 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.890
 digested also here there are fats 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.840
 necessary for our body portion 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:25.220
 makes 42 grams in one spoon 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:27.530
 of them we have 26 grams of protein 1 gram 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.890
 fiber carbohydrates 7 grams well 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.170
 very good fat 2 grams 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.920
 that is, it is a good protein if we 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.080
 want to dial 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.970
 lean muscle mass without excess 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.910
 carbohydrate to dial 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:43.700
 the fat pad is written there 6 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:46.640
 protein source count at 6. about foam 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.640
 it is usually so obscure the milk mixture 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.789
 that is, they start the same protein 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.399
 differently call but know everything to 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:58.459
 ground serum not 7 of milk is done 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:01.250
 so why not deceived nothing 

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:02.450
 came up with so much knit no protein here 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:07.270
 it could be added 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:09.770
 no regrets about packing 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.759
 slightly cheated at the manufacturer and 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.810
 instead of standard 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.140
 5 pounds 5l makes a little less here 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.550
 46 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.250
 or translated into two kilograms 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.700
 kilograms 100 grams but the number of port 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.030
 does not matter 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.830
