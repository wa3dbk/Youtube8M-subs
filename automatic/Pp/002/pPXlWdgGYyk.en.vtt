00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
jump another exercise might be a little

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:27.359 
jump another exercise might be a little
short<00:01:24.549> double<00:01:25.210> we<00:01:26.079> ask<00:01:26.560> your<00:01:26.710> horse<00:01:26.799> to<00:01:26.920> pop<00:01:27.189> in

short double we ask your horse to pop in
and<00:01:27.549> then<00:01:27.969> have<00:01:28.180> to<00:01:28.360> use<00:01:28.750> their<00:01:29.259> own<00:01:29.289> back

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
and then have to use their own back

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.130 
and then have to use their own back
strength<00:01:30.100> over<00:01:31.000> the<00:01:31.119> next<00:01:31.420> second<00:01:31.810> jump<00:01:31.960> and

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
strength over the next second jump and

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.249 
strength over the next second jump and
it<00:01:32.500> helps<00:01:33.009> improve<00:01:33.369> their<00:01:33.549> technique<00:01:33.909> a<00:01:34.259> lot

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
it helps improve their technique a lot

and also when taking off asks your horse

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.789 
and also when taking off asks your horse
to<00:01:45.579> jump<00:01:45.880> upwards<00:01:46.390> enter<00:01:47.109> the<00:01:47.200> year<00:01:47.409> rather

than jumping long and flat it is always

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.149 
than jumping long and flat it is always
important<00:01:51.969> that<00:01:52.500> while<00:01:53.500> the<00:01:53.679> distance<00:01:54.039> is

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
important that while the distance is

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:56.550 
important that while the distance is
short<00:01:54.369> it<00:01:54.549> is<00:01:54.729> not<00:01:54.969> too<00:01:55.240> short<00:01:55.509> as<00:01:55.750> to

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
always be helping them and improving

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.830 
always be helping them and improving
their<00:02:00.880> jumping<00:02:01.240> rather<00:02:02.200> than<00:02:02.490> interfering<00:02:03.490> or
