00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.860
 Life or death, the decision was easily avoided 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.789
 Everyone wanted to be in the little time machine as fast as possible 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:21.120
 main thing away, from the zombies out of the city, quickly away from here 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.050
 and so it started, the time is raging everything flies past us, all eyes were 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.730
 Big was amazed by the time 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.400
 flew up into the light, almost like dead 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.230
 but then our heroes arrived, time is pretty fast ' 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.219
 and nobody could say where they were, nobody has a plan 

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:40.190
 Sach times is this the right time here? Shit old, NO! Where did we land? IN THE MIDDLE 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.980
 IN SHOT Just sand and rock, how can that be done 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.839
 his? The machine needs petrol but refueling appears 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:48.499
 pretty impossible, but not far from her wreck 

00:00:48.499 --> 00:00:51.069
 our heroes find a city 

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:56.509
 Get the revolver out, that's desperado, life is over and the west is merciless 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.960
 but we will not give up at some point we come out alive here 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:08.000
 Get the revolver out, that's desperado, life is over and the west is merciless 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.100
 AND THE WEST GNADENLOOOHOOHOOS
