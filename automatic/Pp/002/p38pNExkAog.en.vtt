00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.570
 there is a very good stove wanted that commenting 

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:06.970
 and I bring you in addition to the abduction goal of this 

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:08.560
 tomorrow a gameplay as I told you with 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.750
 the tie 25 of break and you are watching the 

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.490
 class the truth is that it did not cost me 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.230
 too much get me the technique found in 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.390
 a couple of days a day and a half I finished it 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.970
 pulling out and well I'm going to make a 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.039
 general assessment because and a summary 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.360
 because a lot of people have not seen 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:23.710
 the videos because I say in each video 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.680
 saying a bit how you get each 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.939
 thing of prestige theme is the theme 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.529
 camouflages and all that as they put the 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.420
 things and all that makes good in 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:33.130
 First and I told hears uploaded 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.840
 another video a trace in 94 that what 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.820
 I'll talk a little about him and the series in 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.829
 you have it above, swimming if 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.690
 you have not seen it good we went to 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:42.640
 commenting on this gameplay as you can see is a 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.690
 cut the general to the map while the 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.190
 true that they are four quite general 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.570
 short by the enemies they end up going from 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.460
 a waist the game eight minutes or 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.989
 out there the friends end up going from the 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.480
 departure and we decided to take the barracks 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:53.559
 general fast you see that we 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.789
 we play this game mode because 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:56.350
 It is usually in a lot of points 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:57.670
 especially when you enter the barracks 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.399
 and kill people inside the barracks give a 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.870
 lots of points plus points 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:04.749
 that come in handy for streaks and 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.430
 all that not me for example good morning 

00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:07.990
 I plan to upload is a game 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.310
 and also a little later from her that 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.630
 make me a lot of points or cut 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.580
 general well and not necessarily 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.530
 entering too much barracks in this case 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.580
 without this game although you had confused 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.130
 high for I'm getting enough to 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.260
 barracks and give defend it do not enter good 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.550
 As you will see, it is a job that 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.560
 took out I think three white and in example 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.080
 it's not bad at all, although already 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.460
 you know that in this game you can not 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.250
 use with jump posts then I'm 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.150
 playing then a little further away from the 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.770
 good goal 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.229
 at the beginning the objective enters and such 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.640
 but there are times that you can not because 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:38.690
 they are many inside and it does not give you a 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.600
 rifle look at this situation 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:44.000
 the guy moves with the betty as you see 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.740
 came a rum knife now I will explain 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.050
 how the camouflage of the 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.550
 knife and first of all I wanted to 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:53.240
 talk too I already told you a little about 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:55.250
 the caip in the outsider of 63 then in 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.870
 this case I carry it with a handle and with 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.490
 Jacketed bullets I like a lot 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.770
 play with butt but in this case good 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.270
 I preferred to take the two accessories and 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.860
 take the ghost advantage to 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.300
 ghost google servant only works 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.380
 if you move then if a person who 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.780
 is always moving so I 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.700
 it comes in handy so I do not have to 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.260
 I did not have to be comfortable with the 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.740
 time to treat him because these people 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.240
 is in this game people have a lot 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.130
 custom of continually pulling 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.150
 radars then the advantage of accounts 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.560
 hand advantage that comes in handy 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.500
 why 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.690
 and honestly it's well done because the 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.849
 people who usually put it on were 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.319
 roaming in corners and without moving in 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:32.540
 this case if camps is in a corner 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.709
 so the radar will come out so I eat 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.060
 this time you see continuously in 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.800
 movement is something that is once 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.380
 for in the barracks or whatever or 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.300
 throwing some streak so nothing happens 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.500
 that there was a double and the caught one pw 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.849
 as the ground has seen another weapon that 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.990
 I also have gold and what to extract in 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:48.840
 brief is also a job adds gold 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:51.090
 and I'm going to tell you a bit about how 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.910
 get the weapons of gold in principle 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.780
 mainly the weapons have 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:58.230
 different categories as you know 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.420
 rifles sniper rifles and so on 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.370
 then each weapon in particular has its 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.660
 way of making gold for example the 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.090
 Shotguns and snipers are 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.250
 low of a shot if I'm not wrong the 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.410
 automatic did not ensure 100% follow like this 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.120
 but good snipers too 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.070
 some of you know that they do not kill with a shot 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.420
 so try to hit him in the head or 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.910
 you have to what extremes and if 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.910
 you want to take out the final camouflages of 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:23.040
 armament is good they are in principle with 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.840
 all weapons 100 for example franc 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.550
 day and shotguns are 100 casualties in shooting and 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.620
 with rifles and submachine guns and heavy are 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.140
 100 casualties in the head then once 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.760
 complete the 100 casualties in the head 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:35.640
 can unlock new ones 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.560
 challenges to do more camouflages by 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.500
 example kill 150 signals and in 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.740
 150 accessories without advantages kill 20 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.750
 enemies knows kill 20 times 5 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.160
 enemies without dying so there are several countries 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.240
 that explain it once you get the 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.670
 five times they explain it to you 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.990
 and also for example these challenges 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.790
 also changing and the weapon depends on 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.840
 example the rifles there is a challenge that 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.790
 10 shots are far 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.620
 I think 20 right now I do not remember 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.910
 the submachine guns in 22 far are 30 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.440
 revenge is to kill the one who has 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.810
 killed so do not worry about that 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.280
 because he puts them in the game in both 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.140
 with French he puts it and once he completes 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.960
 this the camouflages because they are the 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.790
 golden camouflage and some asked 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.560
 how do not we put on the camouflage 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.090
 simply put yourself in the class 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.280
 and when you are right in that class 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.920
 when you are going to edit the room class 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.590
 button or the triangle of play 3 and there 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.390
 leaves you with the camouflage that you want in 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.860
 You can also put camouflage on top 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.390
 to the secondary ones and you can also put 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.530
 camouflage to the knife as you see in this 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.060
 example I carry the knife you will have 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.070
 seen and you will see it then the 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.260
 elite camouflage the knife that passes 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.790
 a reynoso knife that does not cut and 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.960
 you can also change it without further 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.400
 what to give the go which is known if 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.230
 on top of the jungle class which the 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.490
 team neisse the color knife that 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:44.830
 You can also take it out of gold 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.960
 There are 200 stabbings that I have also 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.190
 got with the knife but not worth 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.510
 normal if you do not have to have the 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.280
 knife that when you do not fuck 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.470
 secondary comes the knife like in this 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.790
 case that I do not have secondary because it comes out 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.540
 the knife you will see later again 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.910
 again 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.530
 I ran out of bullets in this case look at the 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.390
 right time there was a respond good people 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:04.180
 here with white they got hooked x when 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.560
 I run out of bullets and well there's no pick 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.880
 of the ground but you'll see soon 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.310
 that I get the knife back is like 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.650
 orange color by the elite let's go 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.030
 you give the back or the select and you can 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.550
 put the color you want and I tell you 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:17.200
 200 stabbings for the camouflage of 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.270
 I think it's snake and then from 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.560
 there are different challenges that are not 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.060
 can see until they have 200 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.680
 stabbings and how he was saying no 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.180
 they are worth the normal knife so I 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.260
 I also plan to make the knife 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.260
 of gold I will not make a fourth goal 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:31.390
 gold knife because I have enough 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:33.790
 started the knife so I did not 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:35.170
 it's worth it and another goal that I have 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:37.030
 it's also making all the golden rifles 

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:38.470
 to have the diamond rifles as 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.180
 I said in principle if you get all 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:41.800
 the weapons of a gold category go 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.390
 to the option of wearing the diamond 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.100
 so now I have a 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:47.140
 Gold SMG would be to pd w 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.870
 that looks at us this collected from the ground and 

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:51.330
 then I also have 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.310
 the most minute dot to point to get me the 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.620
 of gold are his rifles the last one 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:57.480
 I will be the boy who is a submachine gun 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.190
 bursts which I'll do a series on 

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:03.500
 youtube and I'll try to make it after 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:06.710
 the break in 94 if not then 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:08.540
 I'll try to finish it and if we do not do the 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:11.540
 de soria would be at once and once 

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:12.800
 get the camouflage that of gold was 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:14.660
 a suit of chj with gold I will have the 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.730
 other than gold and will not come all of a sudden 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:17.750
 We wait for you because according to the 

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:19.610
 guiri who have the camouflages of 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:22.550
 diamond is what he says for example 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:24.110
 has the specials and the bazocas of 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:26.180
 diamond so good in principle 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.440
 It seems true because it is no end or 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.060
 nothing so we 'll see when we 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.680
 have internet and I tell you after the before 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:32.150
 possible diamond weapons to the channel 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.460
 because I think it's going to be something that 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:36.440
 few people will have and respect the road 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:38.180
 today's soccer of the 94's there are people that 

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:40.250
 He has accused me and that there is a little 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.300
 it's true that I do not deny it, it's worth 

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.830
 you know that in this game I do not know 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.450
 can be used with full and jumping and less 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:45.410
 if you are going to make heads so I ask you 

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:46.850
 a little understanding with those 

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:49.070
 gameplays the road to walk are games 

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:50.870
 that are not as public good that you 

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:52.160
 they go wrong one only to your see it is not me 

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:54.050
 I upload all the games I play 

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.280
 absolutely all try to go with a 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:56.990
 little more of care because I carry a 

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.100
 assault rifle and also I do not take the 

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:59.480
 murderers that I like like the 

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.669
 butt to be able to go a little more to sack 

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:03.560
 I do not go in. I think that a little bit of 

00:07:01.669 --> 00:07:05.570
 understanding with the theme of the time with 

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.890
 n24 makes us nervous are rifles 

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:08.990
 assault is very difficult to play in this 

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:10.280
 game with assault rifle and you should 

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:12.020
 know because everything 

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.970
 game with their rifles and rifles 

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:15.590
 close you bursting above all wanting 

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:18.110
 go to make heads and go to make heads 

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:19.340
 it's hard to go there's 94 his name is a 

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:20.840
 weapon that trembles quite a bit so 

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:22.400
 I need precision needs to be still 

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:24.320
 and I need to point to people on average 

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.760
 distance I could not get out because you 

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:27.290
 when you go to story sense of face 

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:29.000
 you say go give him the head you do not kill him and 

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:31.070
 it is already so that it does not kill you so good 

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.810
 all that and tomorrow kids for 

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:35.150

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:36.650

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:44.120
