so moving down in price point we've got

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.440 
so moving down in price point we've got
the<00:00:12.960> new<00:00:13.110> Sigma<00:00:13.500> range<00:00:13.830> of<00:00:14.070> C<00:00:14.250> rods<00:00:14.519> we've<00:00:15.269> got

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
the new Sigma range of C rods we've got

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.109 
the new Sigma range of C rods we've got
ten<00:00:15.780> rods<00:00:15.990> in<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.260> range<00:00:16.470> covering<00:00:17.010> all<00:00:17.910> the

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
ten rods in the range covering all the

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.740 
ten rods in the range covering all the
necessary<00:00:18.330> styles<00:00:19.080> of<00:00:19.199> rods<00:00:19.410> required<00:00:19.800> and

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:23.750 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.970 

the<00:00:24.750> object<00:00:25.080> of<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.199> exercise<00:00:25.500> was<00:00:25.920> to

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
the object of the exercise was to

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.950 
the object of the exercise was to
develop<00:00:26.310> this<00:00:26.670> range<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:27.090> rods<00:00:27.359> to<00:00:27.599> make<00:00:27.750> them

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
develop this range of rods to make them

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.089 
develop this range of rods to make them
as<00:00:28.109> slim<00:00:28.410> and<00:00:28.590> modern<00:00:29.369> as<00:00:29.490> possible<00:00:30.330> with<00:00:31.199> good

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
as slim and modern as possible with good

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.979 
as slim and modern as possible with good
performance<00:00:32.700> at<00:00:32.850> this<00:00:32.969> very<00:00:33.270> very<00:00:33.480> key<00:00:33.690> price

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
performance at this very very key price

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.870 
performance at this very very key price
point<00:00:34.320> that's<00:00:35.010> right<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.460> we've<00:00:35.730> actually

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
point that's right and we've actually

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.610 
point that's right and we've actually
achieved<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.480> because<00:00:36.719> even<00:00:37.020> I<00:00:37.200> was<00:00:37.350> surprised

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
achieved it because even I was surprised

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.590 
achieved it because even I was surprised
just<00:00:37.800> how<00:00:37.920> light<00:00:38.250> they<00:00:38.579> are<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:39.090> as<00:00:39.329> you<00:00:39.480> can

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
just how light they are and as you can

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.720 
just how light they are and as you can
see<00:00:39.750> very<00:00:39.780> very<00:00:40.079> slim<00:00:40.410> diameter<00:00:40.890> but<00:00:41.250> with

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
see very very slim diameter but with

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.180 
see very very slim diameter but with
powerful<00:00:42.120> actions<00:00:42.450> too<00:00:42.660> so<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:44.010> black

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
powerful actions too so the black

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.590 
powerful actions too so the black
construction<00:00:44.460> is<00:00:44.879> actually<00:00:45.180> carbon

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
construction is actually carbon

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.220 
construction is actually carbon
composite<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.620> we've<00:00:47.129> gone<00:00:47.309> for<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:48.230> decent

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
composite and we've gone for a decent

quality guide on all of the Sigma rods

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.340 
quality guide on all of the Sigma rods
this<00:00:52.440> is<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:53.510> titanium<00:00:54.510> oxide<00:00:55.140> insert<00:00:55.739> guide

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
this is a titanium oxide insert guide

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.380 
this is a titanium oxide insert guide
and<00:00:58.350> we've<00:00:58.500> gone<00:00:58.680> for<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.370> matte<00:00:59.760> finish<00:00:59.969> on<00:01:00.270> the

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
and we've gone for a matte finish on the

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.250 
and we've gone for a matte finish on the
blank<00:01:00.629> with<00:01:01.230> this<00:01:01.410> distinctive<00:01:02.070> blue

racks doesn't it when you put them

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.600 
racks doesn't it when you put them
alongside<00:01:07.260> competitor<00:01:07.950> rods<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.490> do

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
alongside competitor rods you do

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.370 
alongside competitor rods you do
actually<00:01:08.760> stand<00:01:09.180> out<00:01:09.330> that's<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.810> idea<00:01:10.140> yeah

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
and let's have a look first at the boat

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.429 
and let's have a look first at the boat
rods<00:01:14.189> so<00:01:14.700> we've<00:01:14.850> got<00:01:15.030> three<00:01:15.330> seven-foot<00:01:16.229> boat

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
rods so we've got three seven-foot boat

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.969 
rods so we've got three seven-foot boat
was<00:01:16.619> in<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.890> range<00:01:17.600> you've<00:01:18.600> got<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.780> 12<00:01:19.080> pound

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
was in the range you've got a 12 pound

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.340 
was in the range you've got a 12 pound
class<00:01:20.189> action<00:01:20.610> 20<00:01:21.119> pound<00:01:21.299> class<00:01:21.540> action<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.049> a

30<00:01:22.590> pound<00:01:22.710> class<00:01:22.890> action<00:01:23.369> again<00:01:23.939> very<00:01:24.180> slim

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
30 pound class action again very slim

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.149 
30 pound class action again very slim
very<00:01:24.689> lightweight<00:01:24.900> although<00:01:25.890> we<00:01:26.009> haven't

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
very lightweight although we haven't

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.830 
very lightweight although we haven't
gone<00:01:26.340> for<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.580> ultra<00:01:26.909> long<00:01:27.090> for<00:01:27.450> grip<00:01:27.659> this

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
gone for the ultra long for grip this

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.240 
gone for the ultra long for grip this
before<00:01:28.229> grip<00:01:28.409> is<00:01:28.530> still<00:01:28.680> long<00:01:28.829> enough<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.159> get

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
before grip is still long enough to get

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.249 
before grip is still long enough to get
both<00:01:29.460> hands<00:01:29.759> on<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.119> so<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.329> can<00:01:30.390> put<00:01:30.900> maximum

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
both hands on it so you can put maximum

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.130 
both hands on it so you can put maximum
compression<00:01:31.740> on<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:31.950> fish<00:01:32.299> and<00:01:33.299> again<00:01:33.869> you

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
compression on the fish and again you

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.719 
compression on the fish and again you
know<00:01:34.229> they're<00:01:34.439> neatly<00:01:34.680> finished<00:01:34.979> they<00:01:35.430> stand

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
know they're neatly finished they stand

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.690 
know they're neatly finished they stand
out<00:01:36.439> one<00:01:37.439> point<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.799> mention<00:01:38.130> on<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.340> boat<00:01:38.490> was

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
out one point to mention on the boat was

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.630 
out one point to mention on the boat was
is<00:01:38.850> that<00:01:38.880> we<00:01:39.180> have<00:01:39.390> got<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.600> reinforced<00:01:40.640> joint

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
is that we have got a reinforced joint

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.609 
is that we have got a reinforced joint
system<00:01:42.060> here<00:01:42.270> which<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:42.869> very<00:01:43.079> important<00:01:43.530> at

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
system here which is very important at

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.950 
system here which is very important at
this<00:01:43.740> price<00:01:43.979> point<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.659> of<00:01:45.659> course<00:01:45.840> we've

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
this price point and of course we've

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.990 
this price point and of course we've
gone<00:01:46.079> for<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.380> long<00:01:46.590> tip<00:01:46.890> short<00:01:47.189> boat<00:01:47.430> design

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
gone for the long tip short boat design

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.120 
gone for the long tip short boat design
yeah<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:48.990> it's<00:01:49.079> stiff<00:01:49.380> made<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.710> book<00:01:49.890> that<00:01:50.100> a

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
yeah and it's stiff made the book that a

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.469 
yeah and it's stiff made the book that a
little<00:01:50.310> bit<00:01:50.399> stiffer<00:01:50.790> so<00:01:50.939> it<00:01:51.090> gives<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:51.360> that

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
little bit stiffer so it gives you that

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.060 
little bit stiffer so it gives you that
little<00:01:51.630> bit<00:01:51.750> better<00:01:51.899> action<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.560> the

three-piece and a two-piece option

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.199 
three-piece and a two-piece option
that's<00:02:08.130> right<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.580> that's<00:02:08.670> my<00:02:08.880> request

that's right and that's my request

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.820 
that's right and that's my request
through<00:02:09.569> three-piece<00:02:10.020> a<00:02:10.050> lot<00:02:10.350> of<00:02:10.440> people<00:02:10.649> like

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
through three-piece a lot of people like

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.309 
through three-piece a lot of people like
because<00:02:11.039> its<00:02:11.310> ease<00:02:11.430> of<00:02:11.640> transportation<00:02:12.390> but<00:02:13.050> a

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
because its ease of transportation but a

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.690 
because its ease of transportation but a
lot<00:02:13.500> of<00:02:13.530> people<00:02:13.800> like<00:02:13.920> a<00:02:13.950> two-piece<00:02:14.370> as<00:02:14.520> well

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
lot of people like a two-piece as well

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.309 
lot of people like a two-piece as well
so<00:02:15.000> you've<00:02:15.390> got<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.660> option<00:02:15.780> there

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
so you've got the option there

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:17.960 
so you've got the option there
the<00:02:16.530> two-piece<00:02:16.920> just<00:02:17.550> gives<00:02:17.730> you<00:02:17.790> that<00:02:17.880> little

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
the two-piece just gives you that little

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.370 
the two-piece just gives you that little
bit<00:02:18.180> more<00:02:18.300> power<00:02:18.540> as<00:02:18.690> well<00:02:18.870> because<00:02:19.140> you<00:02:19.230> only

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
bit more power as well because you only

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.830 
bit more power as well because you only
got<00:02:19.590> one<00:02:19.800> spigot<00:02:20.520> as<00:02:20.610> opposed<00:02:20.850> to<00:02:20.970> two<00:02:21.120> and

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
got one spigot as opposed to two and

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.870 
got one spigot as opposed to two and
what<00:02:22.050> sort<00:02:22.350> of<00:02:22.440> casting<00:02:23.370> weights<00:02:23.580> would<00:02:23.790> you

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
what sort of casting weights would you

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.130 
what sort of casting weights would you
be<00:02:24.000> able<00:02:24.120> to<00:02:24.270> cast<00:02:24.510> with<00:02:24.690> these<00:02:24.840> right<00:02:25.020> well

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
be able to cast with these right well

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.420 
be able to cast with these right well
they're<00:02:25.230> rated<00:02:25.530> four<00:02:25.709> to<00:02:25.830> eight<00:02:25.980> ounce<00:02:26.190> but

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
they're rated four to eight ounce but

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.920 
they're rated four to eight ounce but
that<00:02:26.550> would<00:02:26.670> usually<00:02:26.880> be<00:02:27.060> like<00:02:27.300> five<00:02:27.540> ounce<00:02:27.750> in

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
that would usually be like five ounce in

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.660 
that would usually be like five ounce in
a<00:02:27.989> big<00:02:28.110> bait<00:02:28.319> so<00:02:28.590> about<00:02:28.950> five<00:02:29.190> to<00:02:29.310> six<00:02:29.430> ounce

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
a big bait so about five to six ounce

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:36.710 
a big bait so about five to six ounce
and<00:02:29.850> bait<00:02:31.489> we've<00:02:32.489> got<00:02:32.700> a<00:02:32.810> tide<00:02:33.810> rod<00:02:35.510> which<00:02:36.510> is

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
and bait we've got a tide rod which is

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.100 
and bait we've got a tide rod which is
nine<00:02:37.110> foot<00:02:37.410> six<00:02:38.360> again<00:02:39.360> built<00:02:39.600> with<00:02:39.750> a<00:02:39.780> supple

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
nine foot six again built with a supple

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.110 
nine foot six again built with a supple
tip<00:02:40.290> so<00:02:40.590> it<00:02:40.709> sets<00:02:40.890> over<00:02:41.160> in<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.340> tide<00:02:41.550> but

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
tip so it sets over in the tide but

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.400 
tip so it sets over in the tide but
power<00:02:42.360> comes<00:02:42.630> in<00:02:42.780> quite<00:02:42.870> quickly<00:02:43.200> in<00:02:43.350> that

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
power comes in quite quickly in that

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.780 
power comes in quite quickly in that
midsection<00:02:43.680> and<00:02:44.160> particularly<00:02:44.400> in<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:44.640> book

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
midsection and particularly in the book

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.940 
midsection and particularly in the book
to<00:02:44.940> give<00:02:45.060> it<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.209> casting<00:02:45.600> power<00:02:45.810> and<00:02:46.380> but

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
to give it the casting power and but

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.470 
to give it the casting power and but
again<00:02:47.040> very<00:02:47.519> lightweight<00:02:47.700> nice<00:02:48.090> to<00:02:48.269> hold

we've<00:03:39.600> got<00:03:39.720> the<00:03:39.810> 9<00:03:39.989> foot<00:03:40.320> and<00:03:40.470> the<00:03:40.530> 10<00:03:40.709> foot

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
we've got the 9 foot and the 10 foot

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.039 
we've got the 9 foot and the 10 foot
spin<00:03:41.220> and<00:03:41.760> we've<00:03:42.000> got<00:03:42.150> the<00:03:42.299> 10<00:03:42.540> foot<00:03:42.750> beach

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
spin and we've got the 10 foot beach

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:47.330 
spin and we've got the 10 foot beach
pier<00:03:43.350> right<00:03:43.530> that's<00:03:43.769> right<00:03:43.950> so<00:03:46.340> that

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
pier right that's right so that

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
concludes the Sigma range of sea rods

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.220 
concludes the Sigma range of sea rods
and<00:03:49.530> also<00:03:49.890> the<00:03:50.310> seaward<00:03:50.670> section<00:03:51.180> I<00:03:51.359> think

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
and also the seaward section I think

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.680 
and also the seaward section I think
it's<00:03:52.320> fair<00:03:52.470> to<00:03:52.500> say<00:03:52.769> we've<00:03:53.030> maximized<00:03:54.030> the

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
it's fair to say we've maximized the

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.539 
it's fair to say we've maximized the
spec<00:03:55.049> and<00:03:55.230> performance<00:03:55.739> at<00:03:55.890> both<00:03:56.070> these<00:03:56.280> price

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
spec and performance at both these price

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:59.000 
spec and performance at both these price
points<00:03:56.970> and<00:03:57.060> I<00:03:57.690> think<00:03:57.720> that<00:03:58.049> we're<00:03:58.260> confident

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
points and I think that we're confident

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.020 
points and I think that we're confident
that<00:03:59.100> these<00:03:59.250> are<00:03:59.400> going<00:03:59.489> to<00:03:59.549> be<00:03:59.670> very<00:03:59.880> very

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
that these are going to be very very

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.170 
that these are going to be very very
successful<00:04:00.239> very<00:04:00.690> confident
