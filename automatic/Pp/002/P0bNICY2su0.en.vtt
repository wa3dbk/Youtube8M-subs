end up with a screen looking like that

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.059 
end up with a screen looking like that
and<00:02:17.980> what<00:02:18.610> you<00:02:18.640> want<00:02:18.940> to<00:02:19.060> do<00:02:19.209> is<00:02:19.510> just<00:02:20.069> probably

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
and what you want to do is just probably

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:22.920 
and what you want to do is just probably
take<00:02:21.400> those<00:02:21.580> how<00:02:21.760> you<00:02:21.819> not<00:02:22.540> going<00:02:22.750> to<00:02:22.780> go<00:02:22.900> over

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
take those how you not going to go over

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.130 
take those how you not going to go over
that<00:02:23.230> right<00:02:23.440> now<00:02:23.590> and<00:02:24.150> yeah<00:02:25.150> so<00:02:25.540> this<00:02:25.900> is<00:02:26.020> your

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
that right now and yeah so this is your

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.780 
that right now and yeah so this is your
first<00:02:26.440> screen<00:02:26.740> this<00:02:26.920> is<00:02:26.980> going<00:02:27.520> to<00:02:27.580> be<00:02:27.670> your

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
first screen this is going to be your

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.100 
first screen this is going to be your
first<00:02:27.970> program<00:02:28.510> where<00:02:28.720> it's<00:02:28.840> going<00:02:28.989> to<00:02:29.050> be

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
first program where it's going to be

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.790 
first program where it's going to be
made<00:02:29.280> so<00:02:30.280> now<00:02:30.880> that<00:02:31.090> you've<00:02:31.330> basically<00:02:32.110> known

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
made so now that you've basically known

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.250 
made so now that you've basically known
how<00:02:33.010> to<00:02:33.040> use<00:02:33.340> Eclipse<00:02:34.060> like<00:02:34.300> the<00:02:34.510> basics<00:02:34.989> of<00:02:35.140> it

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
how to use Eclipse like the basics of it

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.870 
how to use Eclipse like the basics of it
we're<00:02:35.800> just<00:02:35.920> going<00:02:36.040> to<00:02:36.069> type<00:02:36.280> out<00:02:36.459> a<00:02:36.489> simple

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
we're just going to type out a simple

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.250 
we're just going to type out a simple
line<00:02:37.030> of<00:02:37.180> code<00:02:37.390> and<00:02:37.600> i'll<00:02:37.720> show<00:02:37.750> you<00:02:38.020> how<00:02:38.140> to

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
line of code and i'll show you how to

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.300 
line of code and i'll show you how to
run<00:02:38.680> code<00:02:39.040> and<00:02:39.870> I<00:02:40.870> des<00:02:41.590> as<00:02:41.980> they're<00:02:42.160> referred

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
run code and I des as they're referred

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.229 
run code and I des as they're referred
to<00:02:42.610> the<00:02:43.090> clips<00:02:43.360> is<00:02:43.510> an<00:02:43.630> IDE<00:02:44.140> program<00:02:44.860> runs<00:02:45.850> and

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
to the clips is an IDE program runs and

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:49.020 
to the clips is an IDE program runs and
compiles<00:02:46.989> everything<00:02:47.470> for<00:02:47.769> you<00:02:47.950> so<00:02:48.519> if<00:02:48.880> you

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
compiles everything for you so if you

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.190 
compiles everything for you so if you
don't<00:02:49.209> know<00:02:49.269> what<00:02:49.330> that<00:02:49.390> means<00:02:49.690> don't<00:02:49.840> worry

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
don't know what that means don't worry

about it right now but yeah so your

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.830 
about it right now but yeah so your

want to save click OK and down here at
the<00:03:42.940> bottom<00:03:43.000> it's<00:03:43.690> going<00:03:43.840> to<00:03:43.870> have<00:03:43.989> a<00:03:44.019> console

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
the bottom it's going to have a console

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.990 
the bottom it's going to have a console
and<00:03:44.709> it's<00:03:45.130> going<00:03:45.250> to<00:03:45.310> print<00:03:45.549> it<00:03:45.700> out<00:03:45.820> right

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
and it's going to print it out right

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.509 
and it's going to print it out right
here<00:03:46.239> so<00:03:46.570> it's<00:03:46.720> going<00:03:46.840> to<00:03:46.900> say<00:03:47.019> hello<00:03:47.200> world

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
here so it's going to say hello world

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.940 
here so it's going to say hello world
this<00:03:48.519> is<00:03:48.700> just<00:03:48.820> a<00:03:48.970> basic<00:03:49.150> program<00:03:49.840> that<00:03:50.109> pretty

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
this is just a basic program that pretty

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.520 
this is just a basic program that pretty
much<00:03:51.100> everyone<00:03:51.459> starts<00:03:51.910> out<00:03:52.030> with<00:03:52.320> so<00:03:53.320> y<00:03:53.350> at

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
much everyone starts out with so y at

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.400 
much everyone starts out with so y at
once<00:03:53.769> you've<00:03:53.920> got<00:03:54.010> that<00:03:54.040> done<00:03:55.049> so<00:03:56.049> yeah<00:03:56.230> it

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
once you've got that done so yeah it

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.020 
once you've got that done so yeah it
should<00:03:56.620> look<00:03:56.739> like<00:03:56.799> that<00:03:57.070> now<00:03:57.250> and<00:03:57.489> that

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
should look like that now and that

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.150 
should look like that now and that
should<00:03:58.180> be<00:03:58.269> good<00:03:58.410> so<00:03:59.410> now<00:03:59.890> i'm<00:03:59.950> going<00:03:59.980> to

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
should be good so now i'm going to

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.800 
should be good so now i'm going to
explain<00:04:00.430> a<00:04:00.489> little<00:04:00.760> bit<00:04:00.910> this<00:04:01.239> system<00:04:01.450> dot<00:04:01.780> out

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
explain a little bit this system dot out

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.940 
explain a little bit this system dot out
dot<00:04:01.989> print<00:04:02.590> line<00:04:02.650> is<00:04:03.100> like<00:04:04.060> a<00:04:04.329> code<00:04:05.230> it's<00:04:05.680> a

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
dot print line is like a code it's a

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.930 
dot print line is like a code it's a
method<00:04:06.579> that<00:04:07.030> java<00:04:07.570> has<00:04:07.750> created<00:04:08.079> for<00:04:08.440> you<00:04:08.620> and

00:04:50.059 --> 00:04:50.069 
going to create a new thing and it's

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:51.649 
going to create a new thing and it's
going<00:04:50.159> to<00:04:50.219> be<00:04:50.310> on<00:04:50.370> a<00:04:50.430> new<00:04:50.580> line<00:04:50.759> because<00:04:51.419> we

00:04:51.649 --> 00:04:51.659 
going to be on a new line because we

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:53.839 
going to be on a new line because we
specify<00:04:52.289> that<00:04:52.499> alright<00:04:52.830> so<00:04:53.550> let's<00:04:53.669> go<00:04:53.819> over

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:53.849 
specify that alright so let's go over

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:55.879 
specify that alright so let's go over
what<00:04:53.999> we<00:04:54.270> did<00:04:54.449> here<00:04:54.629> that's<00:04:54.779> different<00:04:55.229> here

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:55.889 
what we did here that's different here

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:58.969 
what we did here that's different here
we<00:04:56.009> have<00:04:56.129> Ln<00:04:56.639> and<00:04:56.909> here<00:04:57.210> we<00:04:57.330> don't<00:04:57.680> Ln<00:04:58.680> means

00:04:58.969 --> 00:04:58.979 
we have Ln and here we don't Ln means

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:01.519 
we have Ln and here we don't Ln means
lying<00:04:59.520> so<00:04:59.939> it's<00:05:00.060> going<00:05:00.180> to<00:05:00.300> create<00:05:00.689> a<00:05:01.020> line<00:05:01.349> of

00:05:01.519 --> 00:05:01.529 
lying so it's going to create a line of

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:04.330 
lying so it's going to create a line of
code<00:05:01.770> so<00:05:02.580> it<00:05:02.909> created<00:05:03.419> a<00:05:03.509> line<00:05:03.719> of<00:05:03.750> code<00:05:04.050> and

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
code so it created a line of code and

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.189 
code so it created a line of code and
this<00:05:05.340> means<00:05:05.789> that<00:05:05.909> it's<00:05:06.539> not<00:05:06.810> going<00:05:06.990> to<00:05:07.110> create

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:07.199 
this means that it's not going to create

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:08.890 
this means that it's not going to create
a<00:05:07.289> new<00:05:07.379> line<00:05:07.529> of<00:05:07.560> code<00:05:07.800> so<00:05:08.039> refer<00:05:08.340> your<00:05:08.430> put

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
a new line of code so refer your put

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:15.110 
a new line of code so refer your put
system<00:05:09.900> dot<00:05:10.050> out<00:05:10.169> dot<00:05:10.229> print<00:05:12.349> and<00:05:13.909> let's<00:05:14.909> say

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
system dot out dot print and let's say

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.459 
system dot out dot print and let's say
how<00:05:15.539> are<00:05:16.469> you<00:05:17.629> it's<00:05:18.629> going<00:05:18.810> to<00:05:18.839> go<00:05:18.960> on<00:05:19.020> the<00:05:19.139> same

00:05:19.459 --> 00:05:19.469 
how are you it's going to go on the same

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:24.290 
how are you it's going to go on the same
line<00:05:19.830> of<00:05:20.009> code<00:05:20.219> as<00:05:20.689> high<00:05:22.370> but<00:05:23.370> not<00:05:23.400> hello<00:05:23.909> world

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
line of code as high but not hello world

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.110 
line of code as high but not hello world
because<00:05:25.080> that's<00:05:25.319> on<00:05:25.469> this<00:05:25.969> separate<00:05:26.969> line

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 
because that's on this separate line

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.230 
because that's on this separate line
that<00:05:27.360> it<00:05:27.539> created<00:05:28.050> with<00:05:28.169> the<00:05:28.319> Ln<00:05:29.089> alright<00:05:30.089> guys

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
that it created with the Ln alright guys

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.260 
that it created with the Ln alright guys
so<00:05:30.449> that<00:05:30.569> should<00:05:30.810> be<00:05:30.900> your<00:05:31.050> first<00:05:31.259> thing<00:05:31.919> and

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270 
so that should be your first thing and

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.189 
so that should be your first thing and
pretty<00:05:33.270> much<00:05:33.330> everyone<00:05:33.689> should<00:05:33.900> have<00:05:34.020> gotten

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:34.199 
pretty much everyone should have gotten

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:36.170 
pretty much everyone should have gotten
up<00:05:34.409> there<00:05:34.589> should<00:05:34.710> be<00:05:34.800> no<00:05:35.089> problems<00:05:36.089> there

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
up there should be no problems there

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.450 
up there should be no problems there
just<00:05:36.569> remember<00:05:36.870> to<00:05:36.900> put<00:05:37.110> everything<00:05:37.460> between

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 
just remember to put everything between

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.519 
just remember to put everything between
these<00:05:38.939> brackets<00:05:39.210> and<00:05:39.629> bracket<00:05:39.960> should<00:05:40.110> always

00:05:43.519 --> 00:05:43.529 
be there and make sure you put your code

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:46.309 
be there and make sure you put your code
