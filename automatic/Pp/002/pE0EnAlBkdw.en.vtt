00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.200
 KARAZIM HIGHLIGHTED HERO 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:24.200
 From the monasteries of Ivgorod, a servant of the Saphtev faith, Kharazim, emerges. 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.800
 As a good monk, he has dedicated his life to serving his thousand and one gods 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.733
 and to their mortal representatives, the patriarchs. 

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:37.266
 Following his will, Kharazim has traveled from Sanctuary 

00:00:37.433 --> 00:00:42.400
 to the battlefields of the Nexus to bring the divine balance to chaos. 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.867
 Kharazim is a mobile and aggressive hero based on talents 

00:00:51.027 --> 00:00:55.733
 to improve your ability to support the team or inflict damage on enemies. 

00:01:00.767 --> 00:01:04.034
 Kharazim can choose trait at the start of each game. 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.333
 Each one will activate a different effect every three basic attacks. 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.667
 Iron cuffs throw a critical blow. 

00:01:12.992 --> 00:01:16.534
 Transcendence heals him or a close ally. 

00:01:17.594 --> 00:01:22.514
 Introspection restores mana and allows you to continue in combat. 

00:01:23.944 --> 00:01:26.911
 Kharazim's first ability is Radiant Onslaught 

00:01:27.072 --> 00:01:29.317
 that can be used with enemies or allies. 

00:01:29.903 --> 00:01:34.120
 Against enemies, the monk jumps forward and hits with a basic attack 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.069
 which puts him in a position to inflict more damage. 

00:01:38.548 --> 00:01:43.542
 This ability stores several loads that allow it to be used in rapid succession. 

00:01:44.773 --> 00:01:48.758
 His next ability, Divine Breath, grants healing and mobility. 

00:01:49.167 --> 00:01:51.510
 Kharazim, and the nearby allied heroes 

00:01:51.802 --> 00:01:53.982
 they will receive moderate healing and an increase 

00:01:54.143 --> 00:01:56.685
 of movement speed of several seconds. 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:01:59.752
 Your other skill, Deadly Scope 

00:01:59.912 --> 00:02:02.781
 it is a self-benefit that will be a great pressure. 

00:02:02.986 --> 00:02:05.919
 Once prepared, it will be activated in the next blow 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:09.982
 Increasing your attack speed and range for several seconds. 

00:02:10.692 --> 00:02:15.359
 When attacking faster, the feature will activate more frequently. 

00:02:16.934 --> 00:02:19.959
 His first heroic skill, Heptagonal Strike 

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:23.478
 unleashes a flurry of attacks on nearby enemies. 

00:02:23.945 --> 00:02:25.359
 It becomes invulnerable 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:30.758
 and each hit inflicts 7% of the enemy's total health as damage. 

00:02:31.874 --> 00:02:35.441
 Each attack hits different heroes and will aim automatically 

00:02:35.601 --> 00:02:38.063
 to the enemy with the greatest remaining health. 

00:02:39.346 --> 00:02:42.291
 Kharazim has a second heroic that is Serenity. 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.285
 It launches itself or an ally, only lasts 3 seconds 

00:02:46.445 --> 00:02:50.245
 but if the target suffers lethal damage in that time 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.220
 will receive a huge amount of healing after a short period 

00:02:54.411 --> 00:02:56.134
 that will return him to battle. 

00:03:00.581 --> 00:03:03.733
 To play with Kharazim, follow these tips: 

00:03:04.554 --> 00:03:08.338
 use Radiant Onslaught to both harm and utility. 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.479
 Use it in combat to give the final blow 

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:15.251
 or to escape from the enemy while the allies inflict damage. 

00:03:15.581 --> 00:03:17.775
 Do not be afraid to use it to escape 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.793
 since it works with henchmen and allied heroes. 

00:03:21.594 --> 00:03:26.418
 Deadly reach and divine Breath help assassins to hunt down their rivals. 

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:29.312
 The highest speed and melee reach 

00:03:29.472 --> 00:03:32.016
 allow them to accompany them while inflicting damage 

00:03:32.176 --> 00:03:36.288
 and a well-synchronized divine Breath can heal several wounded allies. 

00:03:36.948 --> 00:03:39.948
 His heroic abilities offer great tactical variety. 

00:03:40.246 --> 00:03:41.954
 Does the team need more damage? 

00:03:42.114 --> 00:03:46.406
 Choose a heptagonal strike to weaken the enemy before a big fight. 

00:03:47.115 --> 00:03:51.282
 This heroic is fantastic against formations of various warriors 

00:03:51.714 --> 00:03:54.937
 as it inflicts damage based on the health of the enemy. 

00:03:55.894 --> 00:04:00.390
 Serenity is perfect against extremely aggressive teams. 

00:04:00.815 --> 00:04:02.687
 Use it in a vulnerable ally 

00:04:02.847 --> 00:04:05.959
 before the opponent hits the final blow. 

00:04:06.385 --> 00:04:10.108
 Your ally will survive with enough health to respond. 

00:04:10.426 --> 00:04:12.571
 Remember its short reach: 

00:04:12.731 --> 00:04:16.565
 surely you will have to use Radiant Onslaught to position yourself. 

00:04:17.447 --> 00:04:20.856
 Kharazim has relatively little health and does not inflict the greatest 

00:04:21.016 --> 00:04:23.683
 amount of damage after using their abilities. 

00:04:24.505 --> 00:04:30.278
 When it enters the battle, a coordinated team attack can eliminate it. 

00:04:36.114 --> 00:04:39.757
