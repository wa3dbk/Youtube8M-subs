preventive<00:00:12.389> maintenance<00:00:12.599> wanted<00:00:13.440> to<00:00:13.500> talk<00:00:13.710> to

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
preventive maintenance wanted to talk to

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.259 
preventive maintenance wanted to talk to
you<00:00:13.889> a<00:00:13.950> little<00:00:14.009> bit<00:00:14.219> about<00:00:14.309> tires<00:00:14.759> today

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
you a little bit about tires today

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.410 
you a little bit about tires today
especially<00:00:15.929> on<00:00:16.410> skid<00:00:16.920> steers<00:00:17.220> now<00:00:17.850> as<00:00:18.090> you<00:00:18.270> can

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
especially on skid steers now as you can

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.180 
especially on skid steers now as you can
see<00:00:18.570> this<00:00:18.720> is<00:00:18.870> a<00:00:18.900> new<00:00:19.110> machine<00:00:19.290> so<00:00:19.770> these<00:00:19.890> tires

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:20.190 
see this is a new machine so these tires

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.730 
see this is a new machine so these tires
are<00:00:20.460> brand<00:00:20.580> new<00:00:20.910> very<00:00:21.660> little<00:00:22.020> wear<00:00:22.230> on<00:00:22.470> on

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
are brand new very little wear on on

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.130 
are brand new very little wear on on
these<00:00:23.070> tread<00:00:23.370> bars<00:00:23.640> but<00:00:24.330> what<00:00:24.480> happens<00:00:24.840> over

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
these tread bars but what happens over

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.710 
these tread bars but what happens over
time<00:00:25.170> is<00:00:25.650> of<00:00:26.100> course<00:00:26.370> this<00:00:26.940> tread<00:00:27.270> starts<00:00:27.630> to

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
time is of course this tread starts to

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.570 
time is of course this tread starts to
wear<00:00:27.870> down<00:00:27.930> quite<00:00:28.440> a<00:00:28.470> bit<00:00:28.560> now<00:00:29.250> this<00:00:29.400> is<00:00:29.550> a

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
wear down quite a bit now this is a

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.520 
wear down quite a bit now this is a
result<00:00:30.030> not<00:00:30.240> only<00:00:30.300> of<00:00:30.780> the<00:00:31.050> operating

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:31.530 
result not only of the operating

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.619 
result not only of the operating
conditions<00:00:32.129> and<00:00:32.339> the<00:00:32.399> underfoot<00:00:32.910> but<00:00:33.449> also

00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:33.629 
conditions and the underfoot but also

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:36.169 
conditions and the underfoot but also
the<00:00:33.960> operation<00:00:34.530> technique<00:00:34.980> really<00:00:35.910> tight

00:00:36.169 --> 00:00:36.179 
the operation technique really tight

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:38.419 
the operation technique really tight
turns<00:00:36.600> tend<00:00:37.289> to<00:00:37.410> scuff<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.679> tires<00:00:38.070> now

00:00:38.419 --> 00:00:38.429 
turns tend to scuff the tires now

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:40.939 
turns tend to scuff the tires now
interestingly<00:00:39.390> enough<00:00:40.019> when<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.589> bucket<00:00:40.890> is

00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:40.949 
interestingly enough when the bucket is

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:43.279 
interestingly enough when the bucket is
full<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.579> front<00:00:41.850> tires<00:00:42.089> get<00:00:42.780> scuffed<00:00:43.109> a

00:00:43.279 --> 00:00:43.289 
full the front tires get scuffed a

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:44.959 
full the front tires get scuffed a
little<00:00:43.589> bit<00:00:43.710> harder<00:00:44.070> than<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.399> back<00:00:44.640> tires

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
little bit harder than the back tires

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.239 
little bit harder than the back tires
and<00:00:45.269> vice<00:00:46.019> versa<00:00:46.289> when<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.710> buckets<00:00:47.039> empty

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:47.249 
and vice versa when the buckets empty

00:00:47.249 --> 00:00:50.090 
and vice versa when the buckets empty
now<00:00:48.179> we<00:00:48.600> can<00:00:48.749> prevent<00:00:49.050> scuffing<00:00:49.620> just<00:00:49.980> by

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
now we can prevent scuffing just by

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.979 
now we can prevent scuffing just by
making<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.519> little<00:00:50.789> wider<00:00:51.030> arc<00:00:51.390> around<00:00:51.839> the

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
making a little wider arc around the

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.470 
making a little wider arc around the
turn<00:00:52.260> now<00:00:53.129> something<00:00:53.519> to<00:00:53.550> think<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:54.059> when

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
turn now something to think of when

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.979 
turn now something to think of when
you're<00:00:54.690> looking<00:00:55.140> at<00:00:55.260> your<00:00:55.289> tires<00:00:55.649> is<00:00:56.659> how<00:00:57.659> far

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
you're looking at your tires is how far

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.200 
you're looking at your tires is how far
the<00:00:58.050> tread<00:00:58.530> has<00:00:58.739> worn<00:00:59.069> now<00:00:59.640> we<00:00:59.699> don't<00:00:59.909> want<00:01:00.120> to

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
the tread has worn now we don't want to

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.910 
the tread has worn now we don't want to
wear<00:01:00.359> these<00:01:00.569> all<00:01:00.839> the<00:01:00.870> way<00:01:00.989> down<00:01:01.319> to<00:01:01.739> where

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
wear these all the way down to where

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.940 
wear these all the way down to where
they're<00:01:02.579> basically<00:01:03.089> bald<00:01:03.659> the<00:01:04.230> reason<00:01:04.559> is<00:01:04.770> is

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:04.950 
they're basically bald the reason is is

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.430 
they're basically bald the reason is is
you<00:01:05.190> lose<00:01:05.370> all<00:01:05.580> your<00:01:05.610> tractive<00:01:06.150> effort<00:01:06.440> one

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.440 
you lose all your tractive effort one

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.170 
you lose all your tractive effort one
thing<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:07.770> can<00:01:08.010> do<00:01:08.220> though<00:01:08.430> is<00:01:08.640> as<00:01:09.000> you're

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
thing you can do though is as you're

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.730 
thing you can do though is as you're
watching<00:01:09.570> your<00:01:09.690> tires<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.260> again<00:01:10.530> depending

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
watching your tires and again depending

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.230 
watching your tires and again depending
on<00:01:11.070> your<00:01:11.130> underfoot<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.760> operating

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
on your underfoot and operating

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.300 
on your underfoot and operating
conditions<00:01:12.360> is<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:13.320> can<00:01:13.470> rotate<00:01:13.680> them<00:01:14.100> from

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
conditions is you can rotate them from

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.460 
conditions is you can rotate them from
front<00:01:14.550> to<00:01:14.610> rear<00:01:14.990> you<00:01:15.990> always<00:01:16.230> want<00:01:16.440> your

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
front to rear you always want your

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.290 
front to rear you always want your
better<00:01:16.740> your<00:01:17.040> higher<00:01:17.220> traction<00:01:17.730> tire<00:01:17.940> on<00:01:18.180> your

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:18.300 
better your higher traction tire on your

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.510 
better your higher traction tire on your
front<00:01:18.600> because<00:01:19.350> as<00:01:19.530> you're<00:01:19.710> using<00:01:20.130> this<00:01:20.220> skid

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
front because as you're using this skid

front because as you're using this skid
steer<00:01:20.820> this<00:01:21.240> is<00:01:21.420> where<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.720> most<00:01:21.930> weight<00:01:22.230> is

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
steer this is where the most weight is

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.530 
steer this is where the most weight is
transferred<00:01:22.740> as<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:23.910> are<00:01:24.030> loading<00:01:24.240> that
