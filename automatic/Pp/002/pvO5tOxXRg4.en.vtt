 tutorial xdddd and today I'm going to 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:17.080
 teach how to download the game itself 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.330
 prider in case you do not know how the game is 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.180

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:24.130
 sheep xdddd you control the wolf of the 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.619

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.930
 no more waiting and polladas let's start 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.440
 first I tell you that the game is full 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:43.360
 comes in a link does not have 100% virus 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.210
 reliable since I was the one who 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:49.600
 mount the download to mediafire and it's in 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.850
 a single good link when you download the 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.489
 file will leave them a winrar folder 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.680
 like this, the only thing we will do is 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:59.590
 extract it in my case on the desktop 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.780
 to make it easier when I finish 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:05.360
 unzip will leave us all this 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.490
 shit we open this that says install 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.610
 we're going to get a fucking window with the 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:13.160
 most damn music of all we give to 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.120
 where it says install a folder and we give it 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:19.390
 ok and then here where he says urge 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.390

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.920
 we can close that poor and ready the 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:32.509

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:34.610
 do not occupy space ready ready ok 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:37.610

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.530
 Yep when we work we will leave this 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:44.409
