techniques people often ask what the
difference<00:00:10.620> is<00:00:10.769> between<00:00:10.920> a<00:00:11.370> Brawley<00:00:11.880> and<00:00:12.150> a

softbox now what we do is we can do a

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.670 
softbox now what we do is we can do a
few<00:00:14.880> different<00:00:14.969> setups<00:00:15.540> and<00:00:15.809> show<00:00:16.139> you<00:00:16.199> the

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
we use light modifiers like umbrellas

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.050 
we use light modifiers like umbrellas
and<00:01:53.840> soft<00:01:54.080> boxes<00:01:54.470> is<00:01:54.770> quite<00:01:55.070> simple<00:01:55.490> now

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
and soft boxes is quite simple now

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.210 
and soft boxes is quite simple now
photographing<00:01:56.810> lindsay<00:01:57.229> we<00:01:57.770> want<00:01:57.950> the<00:01:58.009> light

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
photographing lindsay we want the light

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.550 
photographing lindsay we want the light
source<00:01:58.580> to<00:01:59.000> be<00:01:59.119> larger<00:01:59.660> than<00:01:59.810> lindsay<00:02:00.290> space

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
source to be larger than lindsay space

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.889 
source to be larger than lindsay space
to<00:02:00.979> be<00:02:01.100> nice<00:02:01.280> and<00:02:01.430> soft<00:02:01.640> now<00:02:02.090> a<00:02:02.240> normal<00:02:02.450> strobe

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
to be nice and soft now a normal strobe

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:04.389 
to be nice and soft now a normal strobe
light<00:02:03.080> here<00:02:03.290> as<00:02:03.350> you<00:02:03.440> can<00:02:03.500> see<00:02:03.590> the<00:02:04.250> light

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
light here as you can see the light

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:05.830 
light here as you can see the light
source<00:02:04.700> is<00:02:04.790> much<00:02:05.060> smaller<00:02:05.420> than<00:02:05.540> Linds<00:02:05.720> in

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
source is much smaller than Linds in

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.719 
source is much smaller than Linds in
space<00:02:06.140> therefore<00:02:06.740> the<00:02:06.830> lights<00:02:07.009> be<00:02:07.190> quite<00:02:07.430> hard

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
space therefore the lights be quite hard

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.969 
space therefore the lights be quite hard
quite<00:02:08.030> harsh<00:02:08.300> a<00:02:08.570> bit<00:02:08.869> like<00:02:09.020> the<00:02:09.350> midday<00:02:09.560> Sun

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
quite harsh a bit like the midday Sun

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.800 
quite harsh a bit like the midday Sun
above<00:02:10.220> here<00:02:10.489> but<00:02:11.120> what<00:02:11.239> we're<00:02:11.330> going<00:02:11.360> to<00:02:11.480> do<00:02:11.600> is

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
above here but what we're going to do is

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.090 
above here but what we're going to do is
we're<00:02:11.989> going<00:02:12.020> to<00:02:12.200> reflect<00:02:12.350> the<00:02:12.590> light<00:02:12.770> in

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
we're going to reflect the light in

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.160 
we're going to reflect the light in
towards<00:02:13.730> the<00:02:13.820> umbrella<00:02:14.209> and<00:02:14.480> it's<00:02:14.930> going<00:02:15.110> to

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
towards the umbrella and it's going to

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.199 
towards the umbrella and it's going to
spread<00:02:15.410> around<00:02:15.560> and<00:02:15.890> come<00:02:16.190> back<00:02:16.220> out<00:02:16.550> so<00:02:17.060> then

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
spread around and come back out so then

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.180 
spread around and come back out so then
the<00:02:17.330> light<00:02:17.510> source<00:02:17.840> is<00:02:18.080> much<00:02:18.470> bigger<00:02:18.770> than

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
the light source is much bigger than

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.449 
the light source is much bigger than
Lindsay's<00:02:19.610> head<00:02:19.850> so<00:02:20.300> it's<00:02:20.420> me<00:02:20.570> nice<00:02:20.780> and<00:02:20.810> soft

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
Lindsay's head so it's me nice and soft

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.140 
Lindsay's head so it's me nice and soft
understanding<00:02:22.459> light<00:02:22.640> fall-off<00:02:22.910> is

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
understanding light fall-off is

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.630 
understanding light fall-off is
important<00:02:23.570> here<00:02:23.810> light<00:02:24.590> is<00:02:24.770> heat<00:02:25.010> and<00:02:25.250> further

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
important here light is heat and further

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.520 
important here light is heat and further
you<00:02:25.820> stand<00:02:26.090> from<00:02:26.269> a<00:02:26.299> fire<00:02:26.570> the<00:02:26.780> cool<00:02:26.959> you<00:02:27.110> are

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
you stand from a fire the cool you are

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.170 
you stand from a fire the cool you are
it's<00:02:27.860> the<00:02:28.070> same<00:02:28.310> with<00:02:28.489> light<00:02:28.670> from<00:02:28.880> a<00:02:28.910> flash

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
it's the same with light from a flash

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.330 
it's the same with light from a flash
here<00:02:30.080> the<00:02:30.230> light<00:02:30.410> from<00:02:30.560> the<00:02:30.680> right<00:02:30.890> is<00:02:31.040> strong

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
here the light from the right is strong

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.310 
here the light from the right is strong
enough<00:02:31.519> to<00:02:31.670> light<00:02:31.850> Lindsay's<00:02:32.180> face<00:02:32.450> but<00:02:33.049> not

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
enough to light Lindsay's face but not

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.570 
enough to light Lindsay's face but not
strong<00:02:33.590> enough<00:02:33.709> to<00:02:33.830> cast<00:02:34.010> a<00:02:34.160> shadow<00:02:34.190> on<00:02:34.549> the

left you can see a shadow on the right

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.039 
left you can see a shadow on the right
from<00:02:37.610> Lindsey's<00:02:37.970> knee<00:02:38.180> that's<00:02:38.510> caused<00:02:38.810> by<00:02:38.989> the

Sun will come down to baobab Beach and
I've<00:02:42.830> noticed<00:02:43.010> the<00:02:43.280> steps<00:02:43.549> on<00:02:43.700> the<00:02:43.760> way<00:02:43.790> down

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
I've noticed the steps on the way down

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.180 
I've noticed the steps on the way down
or<00:02:44.390> make<00:02:44.600> a<00:02:44.630> nice<00:02:44.810> background<00:02:45.320> for<00:02:45.500> a<00:02:45.530> shot<00:02:45.739> we

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
or make a nice background for a shot we

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.330 
or make a nice background for a shot we
can<00:02:46.220> use<00:02:46.489> some<00:02:46.700> of<00:02:46.730> the<00:02:47.410> wooden<00:02:48.410> railings<00:02:49.100> as<00:02:49.280> a

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340

to<00:02:51.290> take<00:02:51.440> some<00:02:51.590> shots<00:02:51.769> we<00:02:52.010> use<00:02:52.160> the<00:02:52.310> steps<00:02:52.579> to

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
to take some shots we use the steps to

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.430 
to take some shots we use the steps to
get<00:02:53.180> a<00:02:53.209> high<00:02:53.360> above<00:02:53.630> Lindsey<00:02:53.989> to<00:02:54.140> get<00:02:54.260> a<00:02:54.290> nice

there gets a nice contrast II pictures

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.340 
there gets a nice contrast II pictures
and<00:03:01.430> we're<00:03:02.090> just<00:03:02.239> gonna<00:03:02.329> be<00:03:02.450> using<00:03:02.630> one<00:03:03.110> light

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
and we're just gonna be using one light

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.530 
and we're just gonna be using one light
with<00:03:03.890> no<00:03:04.190> diffusion<00:03:04.670> whatsoever<00:03:05.090> so<00:03:05.420> it's

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
with no diffusion whatsoever so it's

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.180 
with no diffusion whatsoever so it's
really<00:03:05.630> nice<00:03:05.840> hard<00:03:06.230> crisp<00:03:06.650> light<00:03:06.890> like<00:03:07.160> a

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
really nice hard crisp light like a

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:13.580 
really nice hard crisp light like a
high-fashion<00:03:07.700> image

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.839 

I'll<00:03:14.590> look<00:03:14.830> to<00:03:14.890> all<00:03:15.130> the<00:03:15.280> options<00:03:15.610> reviews
