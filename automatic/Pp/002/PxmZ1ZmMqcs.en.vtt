three here and right now I'm going to be
doing<00:00:08.040> a<00:00:08.250> review<00:00:08.430> on<00:00:09.290> Percival<00:00:10.290> vortex<00:00:10.830> so<00:00:11.690> he

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
doing a review on Percival vortex so he

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.049 
doing a review on Percival vortex so he
is<00:00:12.839> aces<00:00:13.320> back<00:00:13.530> we<00:00:13.740> gone<00:00:13.920> in<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.160> show<00:00:14.400> I'm<00:00:14.969> a

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
is aces back we gone in the show I'm a

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.660 
is aces back we gone in the show I'm a
huge<00:00:15.900> fan<00:00:16.230> of<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.470> vortexes<00:00:17.190> and<00:00:17.220> this<00:00:17.460> one

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
huge fan of the vortexes and this one

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.380 
huge fan of the vortexes and this one
doesn't<00:00:18.000> disappoint<00:00:18.810> so<00:00:19.680> I<00:00:20.240> look<00:00:21.240> at<00:00:21.330> the

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
doesn't disappoint so I look at the

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.960 
doesn't disappoint so I look at the
outside<00:00:21.540> first<00:00:21.990> he<00:00:22.320> has<00:00:22.410> he's<00:00:22.650> like<00:00:22.890> we<00:00:23.850> had

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
outside first he has he's like we had

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.250 
outside first he has he's like we had

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
little new things on both wings these he

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.320 
little new things on both wings these he
has<00:00:28.380> silver<00:00:28.830> strips<00:00:29.160> on<00:00:29.370> both<00:00:29.580> his<00:00:29.790> wings<00:00:30.030> and

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
has silver strips on both his wings and

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.799 
has silver strips on both his wings and
his<00:00:30.810> two<00:00:31.050> horns<00:00:31.410> are<00:00:31.590> silver<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.600> as<00:00:33.600> you<00:00:33.690> can

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
his two horns are silver and as you can

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.959 
his two horns are silver and as you can
see<00:00:33.899> on<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.050> bottom<00:00:34.289> it's<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.469> big<00:00:34.710> magnet<00:00:35.280> big

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
see on the bottom it's a big magnet big

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.000 
see on the bottom it's a big magnet big
magnet<00:00:36.390> hole<00:00:36.570> kind<00:00:36.750> of<00:00:36.899> thing<00:00:37.140> there's<00:00:37.829> the

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
magnet hole kind of thing there's the

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.759 
magnet hole kind of thing there's the
pirate<00:00:38.190> symbol<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.059> on<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.320> back<00:00:40.499> some

00:00:40.759 --> 00:00:40.769 
pirate symbol and on the back some

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:43.279 
pirate symbol and on the back some
little<00:00:40.980> arrows<00:00:41.339> and<00:00:41.670> stuff<00:00:42.079> same<00:00:43.079> on<00:00:43.199> the

00:00:43.279 --> 00:00:43.289 
little arrows and stuff same on the

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:45.529 
little arrows and stuff same on the
bottom<00:00:43.410> kind<00:00:44.249> of<00:00:44.309> basic<00:00:44.670> on<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.910> outside<00:00:45.269> but

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
bottom kind of basic on the outside but

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.569 
bottom kind of basic on the outside but
I<00:00:45.809> like<00:00:46.260> this<00:00:46.379> silver<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:46.890> looks<00:00:47.039> pretty<00:00:47.280> cool

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
I like this silver it looks pretty cool

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.380 
I like this silver it looks pretty cool
and<00:00:48.329> then<00:00:48.839> I<00:00:49.109> saw<00:00:49.499> this<00:00:49.620> guy<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.149> Pyrus<00:00:51.149> and

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
and then I saw this guy and Pyrus and

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.209 
and then I saw this guy and Pyrus and
subterra<00:00:51.929> but<00:00:52.409> I<00:00:52.440> know<00:00:52.589> some<00:00:52.859> people<00:00:52.890> have

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
subterra but I know some people have

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.509 
subterra but I know some people have
them<00:00:53.309> in<00:00:53.399> darkest<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.030> stuff<00:00:54.300> so<00:00:55.019> anyways<00:00:55.890> I'm

00:00:56.509 --> 00:00:56.519 
them in darkest and stuff so anyways I'm

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:58.340 
them in darkest and stuff so anyways I'm
going<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.730> quickly<00:00:56.940> show<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:57.359> kind<00:00:57.899> of<00:00:57.989> his

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
going to quickly show you kind of his

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.619 
going to quickly show you kind of his
action<00:00:58.980> of<00:01:01.159> so<00:01:02.159> as<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:02.729> can<00:01:02.819> see<00:01:03.089> that's<00:01:03.300> kind

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
action of so as you can see that's kind

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.080 
action of so as you can see that's kind
of<00:01:03.749> what<00:01:03.899> he<00:01:03.989> does<00:01:04.170> when<00:01:04.409> he<00:01:04.500> opens<00:01:04.920> up<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.850> I

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
of what he does when he opens up and I

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.720 
of what he does when he opens up and I
like<00:01:06.330> his<00:01:06.480> design<00:01:06.870> a<00:01:06.900> lot<00:01:07.260> he's<00:01:07.530> 640<00:01:08.130> G<00:01:08.340> is<00:01:08.490> mine

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:08.730 
like his design a lot he's 640 G is mine

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.140 
like his design a lot he's 640 G is mine
right<00:01:09.240> in<00:01:09.360> there<00:01:10.280> and<00:01:11.280> I<00:01:11.490> believe<00:01:11.730> they<00:01:11.880> moved

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
right in there and I believe they moved

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.820 
right in there and I believe they moved
that<00:01:12.360> on<00:01:12.600> all<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.900> vortexes<00:01:13.470> they<00:01:13.560> seem<00:01:13.740> to

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
that on all the vortexes they seem to

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.890 
that on all the vortexes they seem to
move<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.190> G<00:01:14.370> powers<00:01:14.760> because<00:01:15.030> pretty<00:01:15.630> sure<00:01:15.810> it

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
move the G powers because pretty sure it

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.390 
move the G powers because pretty sure it
was<00:01:15.990> in<00:01:16.170> there<00:01:16.380> on<00:01:16.410> the<00:01:16.650> original<00:01:17.160> and<00:01:17.280> now

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
was in there on the original and now

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.230 
was in there on the original and now
it's<00:01:17.580> over<00:01:17.730> here<00:01:19.370> but<00:01:20.370> yeah<00:01:20.700> he<00:01:20.880> has<00:01:20.970> three

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
it's over here but yeah he has three

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.990 
it's over here but yeah he has three
heads<00:01:21.540> this<00:01:21.780> is<00:01:21.960> his<00:01:22.080> main<00:01:22.320> head<00:01:22.620> which<00:01:23.100> it's

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
heads this is his main head which it's

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.510 
heads this is his main head which it's
kind<00:01:24.180> of<00:01:24.240> an<00:01:24.330> interesting<00:01:24.810> use<00:01:25.080> because<00:01:25.590> his

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
kind of an interesting use because his

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.370 
kind of an interesting use because his
horns<00:01:26.880> don't<00:01:27.090> flip<00:01:27.480> up<00:01:27.660> it's<00:01:27.870> part<00:01:28.170> of<00:01:28.290> the

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
horns don't flip up it's part of the

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.550 
horns don't flip up it's part of the
head<00:01:28.620> and<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.730> head<00:01:29.910> just<00:01:30.180> kind<00:01:30.450> of<00:01:30.510> hangs<00:01:30.840> it

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
head and the head just kind of hangs it

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.050 
head and the head just kind of hangs it
kind<00:01:32.340> of<00:01:32.430> hangs<00:01:32.640> down<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.360> is<00:01:34.020> floppy<00:01:34.410> but

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
kind of hangs down and is floppy but

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.660 
kind of hangs down and is floppy but
it's<00:01:36.060> an<00:01:36.210> interesting<00:01:36.750> design<00:01:36.900> idea<00:01:37.890> so<00:01:38.610> he

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
it's an interesting design idea so he

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.610 
it's an interesting design idea so he
has<00:01:38.790> green<00:01:39.060> eyes<00:01:39.270> here<00:01:39.660> is<00:01:39.810> little<00:01:40.110> little

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:40.620 
has green eyes here is little little

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.760 
has green eyes here is little little
hands<00:01:41.310> that<00:01:41.490> have<00:01:41.700> other<00:01:42.600> heads<00:01:43.050> on<00:01:43.290> them<00:01:43.500> so

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
hands that have other heads on them so

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.120 
hands that have other heads on them so
they<00:01:44.370> all<00:01:44.730> have<00:01:44.910> green<00:01:45.180> eyes<00:01:45.360> it<00:01:45.810> has<00:01:46.620> again

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
they all have green eyes it has again

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.940 
they all have green eyes it has again
the<00:01:47.190> silver<00:01:47.670> horn<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.360> only<00:01:48.480> has<00:01:48.660> one<00:01:48.690> the<00:01:49.680> it

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
the silver horn it only has one the it

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.980 
the silver horn it only has one the it
has<00:01:50.190> an<00:01:50.310> inside<00:01:50.640> horn<00:01:51.030> in<00:01:51.300> there<00:01:51.630> but<00:01:51.810> it's<00:01:51.930> not

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
has an inside horn in there but it's not

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.080 
has an inside horn in there but it's not
colored<00:01:53.240> and<00:01:54.800> yeah<00:01:55.800> it's<00:01:56.040> pretty<00:01:56.160> pretty<00:01:56.850> cool

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
colored and yeah it's pretty pretty cool

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.110 
colored and yeah it's pretty pretty cool
design<00:01:57.480> wise<00:01:57.720> when<00:01:58.020> he<00:01:58.110> opens<00:01:58.440> up<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:59.120> here

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:00.120 
design wise when he opens up and here

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.820 
design wise when he opens up and here
you<00:02:00.240> can<00:02:00.330> see<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.660> little<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:01.290> gear<00:02:01.560> on<00:02:01.800> it

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
you can see the little the gear on it
