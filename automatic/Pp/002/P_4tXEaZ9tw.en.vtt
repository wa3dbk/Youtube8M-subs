00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:12.610
 collaborator that such to all my friends 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:14.340
 from youtube I am ramÃ³n and today I come to 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.619
 bring a little tutorial that I 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:22.570
 I was asking and well although it's like 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:26.020
 record face cam and games at the same time 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:30.160
 to record your videos or how I do it 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:34.180
 I put my cam and black to me when 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:36.790
 playing and good to show the little one is 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.690
 get here is very simple and you 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.690
 using only 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:49.560
 I show you the practical how 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.560
 set a little touch 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.720
 I will leave the goods in the description for 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:00.050
 have no problem and nothing 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:03.060
 baby good straps is very simple 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.970
 and good here we put 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:08.670
 the key with which we want to start 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.840
 record I recommend you to put a 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:15.780
 same key for the October video and 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.910
 for the next the same key that 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.610
 agree that they begin to pray the two 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.230
 together all programs at the same time 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:27.660
 well they do not have any kind of problems 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:30.550
 when editing the good the options good what 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:34.040
 we put in 30 fps 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:36.060
 well this is for 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.790
 wait for the second one that opens the program 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.890
 disputed 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.890
 this is not betrayal 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:48.429
 this is for you to record 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:52.299
 my microphone so there would be a 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:54.170
 microphone but it suits you it suits you 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:56.659
 I recorded 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:00.350
 that I recorded the October debut on 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:02.420
 microphone because that's how he records the cam and the 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.890
 microphone at the same time I do not know if I 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.780
 understand that is so that in the video 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:13.430
 because if they record this they will record the 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:17.270
 video of the game with with the 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:19.790
 microphone and if they wear this they will record 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:24.700
 the cam with the microphone that suits them 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:29.700
 more because if you record for example 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:31.920
 the microphone with the game 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:36.140
 it may be that of an October video 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:40.950
 and uncoordinated the voice with the mouth not 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:43.250
 I was going to come out if you guys in editing it 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.250
 all right 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:50.550
 then I give you here that is already 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:53.250
 style so that I do not record anything and I put it 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.610
 and I put the debut video capture to record 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.900
 the microphone 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.000
 you choose the microphone you want 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.610
 the micro 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.910
 come here months that he forgot about 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:11.760
 good headset I guess 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:15.180
 and good here in hot cakes we choose the 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:18.750
 key that we want to use for good 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:24.160
 to record to stop the video 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:26.740
 with this 9 I put it with efe 9 the babe 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.250
 and they select the option they want the 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.060
 mind 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.970
 you are put on the button that they want 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.040
 well I will 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.680
 I put this 9 so I was at the same 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.409
 weather 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.819
 to record at the same time as 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:43.230
 I started recording at the same time that the 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:47.830
 French and 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:50.340
 and nothing more than that I believe and any 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:53.480
 I doubt they have consulted me and good 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:57.680
 good and I will show you also how 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:04:01.400
 how to edit a video after this 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.650
 this program is minimized or it 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.290
 minimize before starting the game and 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.010
 always and simple they put it to record and 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.860
 ready 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:13.540
 put 9 as the biggest side or as you want 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.540
 you good 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.690
 I'll show you an example of how to edit it 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.690
 with the studio singer 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:26.790
 after recording put an example 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.790
 after recording a game 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.320
 We're going to sing 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.810
 I'm going to 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:40.599
 good the videos are left at home 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:44.249
 I think so that I leave it so 

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:46.769
 videos and left me here 

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:50.269
 when singing the frap this video is left to me 

00:04:46.769 --> 00:04:54.050
 and the October 

00:04:50.269 --> 00:05:00.159
 well we added the videos 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:05:00.159
 and well first he added the little game 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:06.750
 in the game of mortal kombat 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:09.919
 I recommend you put it in July 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.919
 scary movie wing 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.220
 like this on the scales as they want it 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.910
 you meditate 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:24.540
 that's how it looks in full screen 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:24.540
 written and good to add the way 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:31.270
 to add the video in a corner of 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:34.370
 law was a corner of the game 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:36.930
 we go here on tracks 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:39.280
 audio dick back 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:42.040
 and quiet pib 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:46.400
 and good and now we do this to bouquets the 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:48.790
 video of the campaign and we add it below 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.450
 and this does not appear 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:51.450
 and good 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:06:04.240

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:04.240
 up and from here the guys 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:11.460

 our example 

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:45.420
 for example and well here they edit it as 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:48.090
 you want to put a center or 

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:49.910
 anything and last if not 

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:52.160

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:55.820
 they ask me something they ask what 

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:58.690
 They want me to tell them what they know 

00:06:55.820 --> 00:07:01.460
