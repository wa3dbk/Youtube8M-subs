00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
hi my name is ceci Doucet and I am a

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.670 
hi my name is ceci Doucet and I am a
technical<00:00:05.160> and<00:00:05.400> professional<00:00:05.879> writer<00:00:06.120> and<00:00:06.720> a

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
technical and professional writer and a

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.110 
technical and professional writer and a
lot<00:00:07.919> of<00:00:07.950> the<00:00:08.130> work<00:00:08.280> that<00:00:08.309> I<00:00:08.490> do<00:00:08.610> involves

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
lot of the work that I do involves

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.509 
lot of the work that I do involves
research<00:00:09.360> so<00:00:10.080> when<00:00:10.500> it<00:00:10.679> came<00:00:10.950> to<00:00:11.250> light<00:00:11.490> that

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
research so when it came to light that

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.150 
research so when it came to light that
there<00:00:11.940> might<00:00:12.150> be<00:00:12.179> some<00:00:12.540> problems<00:00:13.080> with<00:00:13.860> health

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
there might be some problems with health

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.980 
there might be some problems with health
that<00:00:14.670> come<00:00:14.820> along<00:00:15.059> with<00:00:15.120> all<00:00:15.389> of<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.630> Wi-Fi

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
that come along with all of the Wi-Fi

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.870 
that come along with all of the Wi-Fi
technology<00:00:16.230> that<00:00:16.859> were<00:00:16.980> adopting<00:00:17.460> now<00:00:17.640> I

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
technology that were adopting now I

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.779 
technology that were adopting now I
started<00:00:18.510> doing<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.810> bit<00:00:18.960> of<00:00:18.990> research<00:00:19.199> and<00:00:19.859> what

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
started doing a bit of research and what

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.779 
started doing a bit of research and what
I<00:00:20.850> found<00:00:20.970> was<00:00:21.869> disturbing<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:22.920> I<00:00:23.310> just<00:00:23.519> wanted

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
I found was disturbing and I just wanted

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.750 
I found was disturbing and I just wanted
to<00:00:23.880> give<00:00:24.029> you<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.180> quick<00:00:24.510> demonstration<00:00:24.720> of<00:00:25.760> how

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
to give you a quick demonstration of how

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.060 
to give you a quick demonstration of how
you<00:00:27.660> know<00:00:27.869> we<00:00:28.019> can't<00:00:28.230> see<00:00:28.470> why<00:00:28.710> I<00:00:28.740> finally

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
you know we can't see why I finally

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.730 
you know we can't see why I finally
can't<00:00:29.429> smell<00:00:29.789> it<00:00:29.820> but<00:00:30.150> we<00:00:30.599> can<00:00:30.840> hear<00:00:31.260> it<00:00:31.410> if<00:00:31.590> we

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
can't smell it but we can hear it if we

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.770 
can't smell it but we can hear it if we
use<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.309> conductor<00:00:33.000> that<00:00:33.149> will<00:00:33.329> allow<00:00:33.540> us<00:00:33.570> to

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
use a conductor that will allow us to

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.380 
use a conductor that will allow us to
and<00:00:34.260> through<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.829> very<00:00:35.130> simple<00:00:35.550> crude<00:00:36.030> home

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
and through a very simple crude home

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.830 
and through a very simple crude home
remedy<00:00:36.870> you<00:00:37.559> use<00:00:37.770> an<00:00:37.950> AM<00:00:38.480> transistor<00:00:39.480> radio

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
remedy you use an AM transistor radio

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.470 
remedy you use an AM transistor radio
and<00:00:40.200> this<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:40.860> just<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.219> cube<00:00:41.520> that<00:00:41.790> amplifies

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
and this is just a cube that amplifies

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.709 
and this is just a cube that amplifies
from<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:43.110> friend's<00:00:43.649> iPod<00:00:44.040> so<00:00:45.000> what<00:00:45.390> I'm<00:00:45.510> going

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
from a friend's iPod so what I'm going

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.450 
from a friend's iPod so what I'm going
to<00:00:45.840> demonstrate<00:00:46.110> is<00:00:46.860> that<00:00:46.890> there<00:00:47.280> are<00:00:47.399> a

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
to demonstrate is that there are a

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.270 
to demonstrate is that there are a
different<00:00:47.899> amounts<00:00:48.899> of<00:00:49.079> radiation<00:00:49.710> that<00:00:50.160> are

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
different amounts of radiation that are

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.279 
different amounts of radiation that are
coming<00:00:50.610> through<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:51.210> us<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.690> potentially<00:00:52.140> to

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
coming through to us and potentially to

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.069 
coming through to us and potentially to
our<00:00:52.379> children<00:00:52.800> in<00:00:52.920> schools<00:00:53.420> based<00:00:54.420> on<00:00:54.750> what

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
our children in schools based on what

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.639 
our children in schools based on what
type<00:00:55.320> of<00:00:55.350> technology<00:00:56.129> they<00:00:56.340> use<00:00:56.610> so<00:00:57.539> first<00:00:58.109> I

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
type of technology they use so first I

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.630 
type of technology they use so first I
will<00:00:59.100> show<00:00:59.129> you<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.969> typical<00:01:00.329> wired<00:01:01.640> desktop

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
will show you a typical wired desktop

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.149 
will show you a typical wired desktop
system<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:04.170> will<00:01:04.320> hear<00:01:04.439> some<00:01:04.500> static

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
system and you will hear some static

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.890 
system and you will hear some static
that's<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.610> electrical<00:01:06.119> field<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:06.659> is

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
that's the electrical field that is

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.820 
that's the electrical field that is
around<00:01:07.200> any<00:01:07.530> electrical<00:01:08.100> object<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:09.619> it<00:01:10.619> goes

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
around any electrical object and it goes

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.030 
around any electrical object and it goes
like<00:01:10.860> this<00:01:11.310> so<00:01:11.369> if<00:01:11.640> I'm<00:01:11.790> working<00:01:11.970> on<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.540> desktop

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
like this so if I'm working on a desktop

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.310 
like this so if I'm working on a desktop
you'll<00:01:14.040> hear<00:01:14.250> about<00:01:14.430> this<00:01:14.670> much<00:01:14.939> static<00:01:15.540> okay

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
you'll hear about this much static okay

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.890 
you'll hear about this much static okay
and<00:01:16.860> that's<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.700> same<00:01:17.880> thing<00:01:18.150> with<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.450> CPU

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
and that's the same thing with the CPU

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.200 
and that's the same thing with the CPU
if<00:01:19.380> it's<00:01:19.680> facing<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.310> in<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.549> front<00:01:20.820> you

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
if it's facing you in the front you

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.630 
if it's facing you in the front you
don't<00:01:21.390> get<00:01:21.570> very<00:01:21.840> much<00:01:22.080> static<00:01:22.619> at<00:01:22.770> all<00:01:22.920> out

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
don't get very much static at all out

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.880 
don't get very much static at all out
the<00:01:23.909> back<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.150> will<00:01:24.540> have<00:01:24.570> more<00:01:24.960> static<00:01:25.530> but

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
the back you will have more static but

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.890 
the back you will have more static but
science<00:01:26.790> has<00:01:26.850> proven<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.600> more

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
science has proven that the more

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.899 
science has proven that the more
distance<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:28.500> can<00:01:28.680> place<00:01:28.890> between<00:01:29.430> yourself

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
distance you can place between yourself

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.420 
distance you can place between yourself
and<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.210> device<00:01:30.560> the<00:01:31.560> less<00:01:31.770> it's<00:01:32.040> going<00:01:32.310> to

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
and the device the less it's going to

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.130 
and the device the less it's going to
impact<00:01:32.729> your<00:01:32.939> physical<00:01:33.619> well-being<00:01:34.939> so<00:01:36.140> again

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
impact your physical well-being so again

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.050 
impact your physical well-being so again
the<00:01:38.130> hardwired<00:01:38.640> system<00:01:39.000> not<00:01:39.869> too<00:01:40.079> bad<00:01:41.060> the

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
the hardwired system not too bad the

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.480 
the hardwired system not too bad the
laptop<00:01:42.630> however<00:01:46.100> that's<00:01:47.100> where<00:01:47.399> I<00:01:47.430> would

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
laptop however that's where I would

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.350 
laptop however that's where I would
normally<00:01:48.000> be<00:01:48.149> keeping<00:01:48.479> my<00:01:48.630> hands<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:50.360> laptops

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
normally be keeping my hands and laptops

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.749 
normally be keeping my hands and laptops
if<00:01:51.720> used<00:01:52.020> in<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.320> lab<00:01:52.530> would<00:01:53.040> have<00:01:53.220> that<00:01:53.430> whole

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
if used in the lab would have that whole

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.910 
if used in the lab would have that whole
force<00:01:54.299> field<00:01:54.689> out<00:01:54.930> in<00:01:54.990> front<00:01:55.439> of<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.680> and

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
force field out in front of you and

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.010 
force field out in front of you and
aiming<00:01:56.640> directly<00:01:56.790> at<00:01:57.119> your<00:01:57.360> body<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.869> you're

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
aiming directly at your body and you're

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.749 
aiming directly at your body and you're
absorbing<00:01:58.530> absorbing<00:01:59.219> that<00:01:59.340> amount<00:01:59.640> of

absorbing absorbing that amount of

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.109 
absorbing absorbing that amount of
radiation<00:02:00.329> so<00:02:00.810> again<00:02:03.229> here's<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.380> desktop

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
radiation so again here's the desktop

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.450 
radiation so again here's the desktop

choices<00:03:24.360> we<00:03:24.480> can<00:03:24.510> still<00:03:24.870> get<00:03:25.020> to<00:03:25.170> the

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
choices we can still get to the

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.780 
choices we can still get to the
technology<00:03:25.650> without<00:03:26.130> Jeopardy's

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
technology without Jeopardy's

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.790 
technology without Jeopardy's

we just wanted to give you a visual so
that<00:03:38.580> we<00:03:38.820> can<00:03:39.000> begin<00:03:39.120> a<00:03:39.300> discussion<00:03:39.510> and<00:03:40.200> see

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
that we can begin a discussion and see

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.290 
that we can begin a discussion and see
how<00:03:40.800> we<00:03:40.860> want<00:03:41.190> to<00:03:41.280> approach<00:03:41.370> Wi-Fi<00:03:42.060> in<00:03:42.210> our

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
how we want to approach Wi-Fi in our

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.400 
how we want to approach Wi-Fi in our
school<00:03:42.630> systems<00:03:43.140> thank<00:03:43.800> you<00:03:43.890> for<00:03:44.070> your<00:03:44.220> time
