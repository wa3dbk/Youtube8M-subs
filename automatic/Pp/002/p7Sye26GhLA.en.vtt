00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.280
 suspected of having a disease 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.500
 brain recommends one 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.019
 neurological examination namely the 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.230
 Measurement and recording of brain waves 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.170
 this investigation will be 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:21.330
 electroencephalography called short eeg 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:23.510
 Every year more than 8,000 eeg at the 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.000
 clinic for epileptology of the 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.289
 university clinic bonn 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.320
 clinic director professor christian elger 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.989
 aware of the virtues of the investigation 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.620
 eeg shows functional changes in the 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.120
 brain in epilepsy can do that 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.780
 malformations of the inside of the pay that 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.340
 but they can also be genetic 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.750
 changes are man through 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.329
 Imaging procedures like the 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.280
 Magnetic resonance tomography sees me the eeg 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:49.950
 are much more specific 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.289
 the actual process again the the 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.360
 epilepsy to customer lays down that 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.250
 Nerve cells at the same time 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.690
 do the same and through this 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.670
 interconnection of the small ones 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.579
 electrical activity of nerve cells 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.110
 war was big, very steep potentials 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.909
 you can diagnose well 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.470
 another big area 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.740
 change of the brain, for example 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.390
 through substances above all things 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.040
 barbiturate so sleep in the 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.500
 suicidal intent 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.390
 or other psychotropic drugs 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.830
 quite characteristic patterns and man 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.259
 can be at a deeply unconscious 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.820
 people at least see that works 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.780
 Do not worry anymore because it might 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.240
 already in the dying process is or is 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.829
 innovative, unconscious wool 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.990
 suicidal intent or otherwise 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.590
 for some reason medications 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.600
 has taken third big area 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.220
 Monitoring on the intensive care unit 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.229
 Patient is after a cardiac arrest 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.390
 been resuscitated again 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.799
 it all works fine though 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.659
 his brain works naturally 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.729
 patient is still comatose us 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.409
 So want to know something about it is there 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.000
 a chance for him to recover or 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.040
 that he does not recover many 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.180
 Therapeutic measures depend on the 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.940
 make the chance 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.010
 here too the eeg gives a lot 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.440
 quick hints if it is good or 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.270
 poorly developed as an example 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.700
 other procedures under circumstances 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.570
 It takes days or even weeks to get there 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.950
 the corresponding abnormalities 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:16.350
 exhibit at eg there are examinations 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.120
 has moved various derivative 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.950
 jelinek here is an example for 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:24.630
 routine eeg by so at the routine eg 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:28.320
 the people stay a maximum of 20 minutes 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:30.270
 here it is only a short time derivative 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.940
 to get a rough overview 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.430
 This looks and at a long time 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.130
 derivation he already says the name 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.930
 longer time that can be a day or 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.290
 also several days in a row 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.660
 because you want to see if there is something 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.209
 does what it looks like in sleep or 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.880
 Some pathological activity occurs 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:53.280
 just for a short time and there 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.620
 one hopes to record that 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.510
 at eg derivations become 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.550
 set points on the head of the 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.799
 patient electrodes attached 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.600
 in addition to a fundamental voltage arise 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:05.580
 in addition to every physical 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.370
 Processes such as opening your eyes 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.440
 low electrical voltages in the brain 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.910
 the electrodes measure the 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.010
 Voltage fluctuations between the 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.010
 individual measuring points in the micro volt and 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.480
 millisecond range over cable 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.299
 Send the signal to you 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.280
 Amplifier on a pc will be the 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.830
 signals then converted and in 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.320
 Waveform represented mainly by 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.150
 External stimuli such as flashes of light become one 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.860
 reaction of the brain during the 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.750
 Examination does not provoke the eyes 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.489
 selecting war on the optical system 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.980
 about the eyes information about the 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.540
 environment and the brain becomes active 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.780
 Background had to be back only 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.790
 The brain keeps you awake so much 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.010
 can jump quickly , the disappears 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.780
 For us, both are important 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.730
 background rhythm tells us something too 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.890
 how good the brain is on it 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.030
 bad mood is then most of the time 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.580
 slows down that can be good 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.920
 interpret and pay attention to this 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.750
 Reaction then trend it if it works 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.700
 Impaired is just one 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.920
 attention is the brain 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.680
 difficult to get there in transit so that 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.690
 the background rhythm persists 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.299
 and there we know that his disorder 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.549
 in more serious diseases such as 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:17.650
 For example, epilepsy is due to 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:19.449
 triggered muscular contraction 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.829
 hard of the origin of the attack in the 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:23.380
 brain to register 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.970
 for this reason there is the possibility 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.130
 the electrodes in the brain too 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.780
 implant 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:32.110
 These electrodes will be in the 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:34.300
 neurosurgery from neurosurgeon ins 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.949
 brain thus introduced these electrons 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.539
 are just on the brain 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:39.580
 there are holes made and the 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:42.820
 through the dura are directly on the brain 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:45.130
 laid and the patients also have to 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.380
 We receive an award so that we decide 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.060
 can where the seizure starts and is 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:53.949
 so begins always at the beginning of the 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:55.449
 same place in the brain and they have 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:57.460
 then definitely just a good one 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:00.150
 idea on sign you have no 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.810
 artifacts with these electrodes the 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.090
 medical-technical assistant 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.490
 besides usually the eeg off and next 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.919
 first interpretation of brainwaves 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:11.620
 before a doctor makes more accurate diagnoses 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:13.960
 Creates at least one year needs one 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.979
 mta to read simple curves and 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.320
 to understand 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:19.510
 and even an experienced doctor has 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:22.090
 sometimes not learned 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:23.950
 There are often very rare phenomena 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:26.620
 difficult-to- interpret phenomena 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:29.740
 and then his grandparents can do it 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.240
 Event the more often it takes 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.060
 a certain amount of time for that 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:36.090
 to discuss how to interpret 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.250
 also with each other for a very long time 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.960
 instruction is now an Egyptian 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.340
 phenomenon or is that one 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.070
 motion disorder coming from another 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:46.650
 Area of ​​the brain, I come chic 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:49.350
 even sometimes videos to colleagues around 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:50.850
 in their opinion to catch up and 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:52.350
 I rely on mine here 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.020
 Employees that already over ten 

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:56.490
 make years and can sometimes 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.229
 disturbances of real potential better 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:01.699
 differentiate than we always only 

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:01.699
 see partial sections
