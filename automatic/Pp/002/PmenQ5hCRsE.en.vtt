00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.799
 plastic and I do black I'm doing 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:12.129
 this video to make the contest of 

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:14.230
 acid spring and I'm going to add a mini 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:17.230
 nail tutorial so they do not see in their 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.420
 houses how the color came to my video is 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.490
 important because it is not that he has taken 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.199
 I just loved it since I was little 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.740
 to use all the colors I do not have a 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:31.359
 favorite town I love everyone makes 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:33.699
 over 12 years I use colors in my hair 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:36.670
 at the beginning it was difficult to get the 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:39.100
 colors on the other side but for 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.859
 little 4 years ago I colored my hair 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.980
 and my thickness as different styles with 

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:47.170
 the color very clear but up to two 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.350
 years with that I found acids 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:52.120
 present trans bad and panic then 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.429
 to combine the colors I will enter 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.900
 the past the blue lately I love 

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:58.540
 this grade 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:02.920
 between the gdp and the turquoise because 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:07.120
 doing hairstyles to seconds like 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:09.730
 Friday combinations all the color what 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.380
 it stung a lot on the nails so 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:15.040
 we listened to all 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:18.370
 I found myself blond and there work 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.970
 the color of the hair on the clothes on the nails 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.970
 etc 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.830
 good that we are going to need for this 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:30.250
 tutorial a foam of those who use 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:33.460
 to apply base on your face those 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:37.780
 glazes me only the pink and a 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:39.160
 turquoise for my daughters and it's the only thing 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.860
 what are we going to do at the end 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.020
 like cotton to clean around and 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.380
 several things and a little detail that I'm going 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.470
 to show at the end I put a base one 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.760
 clear base 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.420
 with silver 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.780
 and we're going to use it with foam and 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.780
 enamels 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.770
 let's apply 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:08.159
 can be 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.159
 in this way reach 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.410
 sometimes 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:18.160
 the tablecloth 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:20.390
 advice have the open ones why it happens 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:25.000
 this 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.000
 we apply the following part of the enamel 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.330
 They can use various colors to use 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.330
 some new 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:38.480
 and we are going to do this procedure in my 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.480
 union we are going to put over 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:46.710
 the brochita and with very soft taps 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.720
 we just polish it then 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.000
 we can go up and down to see a 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.950
 I degraded and we already have our first 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.910
 I can take advantage of 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.910
 the second 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:07.090
 I will continue to load it with enamel to 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:10.230
 the road I was as clear as 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.230
 it could happen 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:21.450
 and I continue with my next soles 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:24.140
 and taps 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.140
 higher 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.480
 then the last one only 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.600
 the very simple techniques on this 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:52.110
 you can draw or paint or do 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:54.180
 another theme combine other shades 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.540
 but they can do it very easily in their 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.540
 houses 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:03.010
 see that I have 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:06.340
 dirty simply pass with a brush and 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.620
 remover and clean at the end we apply 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.580
 are 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:14.489
 a base a base a good top coat and 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:16.829
 this was the result I added a 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:18.989
 very cute little detail that is a charm 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:22.620
 cited 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:24.930
 add the talent 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.130

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.400
 you want this is enough 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.990
 simple but they can add 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.690
 different things to the design 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:36.060
