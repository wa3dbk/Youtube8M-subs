00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
the ocean and and they've incorporated

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.869 
the ocean and and they've incorporated
that<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.219> brought<00:00:53.460> it<00:00:53.550> over<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.820> the

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
that and brought it over to the

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.060 
that and brought it over to the
freshwater<00:00:54.120> side<00:00:54.600> but<00:00:55.230> but<00:00:55.559> I<00:00:55.590> want<00:00:56.010> to

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
freshwater side but but I want to

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.160 
freshwater side but but I want to
explain<00:00:56.399> what<00:00:56.579> chirp<00:00:56.850> is<00:00:57.059> basically<00:00:57.510> chirp<00:00:57.960> is

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
explain what chirp is basically chirp is

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.979 
explain what chirp is basically chirp is
you<00:00:58.980> know<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.280> transducer<00:00:59.910> any<00:01:00.480> graph<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:00.960> have

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
you know a transducer any graph you have

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.189 
you know a transducer any graph you have
works<00:01:01.500> off<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:02.070> certain<00:01:02.870> kilohertz<00:01:03.870> of

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
works off a certain kilohertz of

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.820 
works off a certain kilohertz of
frequency<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.810> some<00:01:06.810> some<00:01:07.409> kilohertz

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
frequency and some some kilohertz

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.109 
frequency and some some kilohertz
frequencies<00:01:08.460> depend<00:01:08.760> on<00:01:08.850> where<00:01:08.970> you're<00:01:09.090> at

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
frequencies depend on where you're at

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.190 
frequencies depend on where you're at
sometimes<00:01:09.659> starts<00:01:09.930> getting<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.170> little

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
sometimes starts getting a little

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.810 
sometimes starts getting a little
interference<00:01:10.710> depending<00:01:11.280> on<00:01:11.400> what's<00:01:11.700> around

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
interference depending on what's around

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.060 
interference depending on what's around
you<00:01:12.270> or<00:01:12.450> whatever's<00:01:12.750> going<00:01:12.990> on<00:01:13.170> but<00:01:13.890> what

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
you or whatever's going on but what

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.510 
you or whatever's going on but what
chirp<00:01:14.340> does<00:01:14.640> is<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:15.509> basically<00:01:16.490> throws<00:01:17.490> a

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
chirp does is it basically throws a

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.170 
chirp does is it basically throws a
range<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.650> frequencies<00:01:19.650> out<00:01:19.860> in<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.939> around

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
range of frequencies out in and around

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.210 
range of frequencies out in and around
that<00:01:21.479> target<00:01:21.930> frequency<00:01:22.409> so<00:01:22.619> for<00:01:22.799> example

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
that target frequency so for example

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.609 
that target frequency so for example
we're<00:01:23.400> at<00:01:23.520> chirp<00:01:23.810> 455<00:01:24.810> kilohertz<00:01:25.229> right<00:01:25.500> now

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
we're at chirp 455 kilohertz right now

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.740 
we're at chirp 455 kilohertz right now
an<00:01:25.770> hour<00:01:25.920> down<00:01:26.070> view<00:01:26.340> on<00:01:26.430> our<00:01:26.520> side<00:01:26.729> view<00:01:27.030> but

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
an hour down view on our side view but

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.050 
an hour down view on our side view but
it's<00:01:27.900> not<00:01:28.049> only<00:01:28.290> just<00:01:28.380> sending<00:01:29.130> out<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.280> 455

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
it's not only just sending out a 455

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.170 
it's not only just sending out a 455
it's<00:01:30.869> sending<00:01:31.200> it<00:01:31.409> out<00:01:31.560> from<00:01:31.890> say<00:01:32.070> 400<00:01:32.820> up<00:01:32.970> to

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
it's sending it out from say 400 up to

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.240 
it's sending it out from say 400 up to
500<00:01:33.840> so<00:01:34.020> it's<00:01:34.200> basically<00:01:34.619> shooting<00:01:35.130> an

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
500 so it's basically shooting an

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.090 
500 so it's basically shooting an
infinite<00:01:36.090> range<00:01:36.390> of<00:01:36.750> frequencies<00:01:37.320> so<00:01:37.860> it's

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
infinite range of frequencies so it's

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.280 
infinite range of frequencies so it's
starting<00:01:38.369> at<00:01:38.460> 400<00:01:38.880> all<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.060> way<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.210> 500<00:01:39.750> 400

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
starting at 400 all the way to 500 400

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.690 
starting at 400 all the way to 500 400
all<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.409> way<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.530> 500<00:01:40.799> so<00:01:41.130> it's<00:01:41.369> just<00:01:41.460> in<00:01:41.640> a

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
all the way to 500 so it's just in a

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.510 
all the way to 500 so it's just in a
millisecond<00:01:42.630> it's<00:01:43.079> scanning<00:01:43.590> all<00:01:44.159> of<00:01:44.430> those

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
millisecond it's scanning all of those

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.460 
millisecond it's scanning all of those
frequencies<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.390> then<00:01:45.540> taking<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.049> gathering

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
frequencies and then taking it gathering

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.980

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
which then gives you a much cleaner more

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.090 
which then gives you a much cleaner more
accurate<00:01:51.810> return<00:01:52.229> some<00:01:52.829> of<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:52.979> other

competition<00:01:53.460> out<00:01:53.850> there<00:01:53.880> for<00:01:54.180> ma<00:01:54.270> I've<00:01:54.390> heard

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
competition out there for ma I've heard

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.179 
competition out there for ma I've heard
they<00:01:54.780> don't<00:01:54.869> really<00:01:55.140> quite<00:01:55.350> do<00:01:55.619> it<00:01:55.740> that<00:01:55.920> same

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
they don't really quite do it that same

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.889 
they don't really quite do it that same
way<00:01:56.430> Garmin<00:01:56.939> is<00:01:57.000> kind<00:01:57.180> of<00:01:57.210> exclusive<00:01:57.600> with<00:01:57.869> the

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
way Garmin is kind of exclusive with the

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.510 
way Garmin is kind of exclusive with the
way<00:01:58.049> they're<00:01:58.200> doing<00:01:58.350> it<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.799> so<00:01:59.250> some<00:01:59.460> other

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
way they're doing it and so some other

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.010 
way they're doing it and so some other
companies<00:02:00.149> might<00:02:00.329> be<00:02:00.479> doing<00:02:00.719> things<00:02:00.869> like

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
companies might be doing things like

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.010 
companies might be doing things like
where<00:02:01.320> they<00:02:01.409> might<00:02:01.590> do<00:02:01.799> maybe<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.579> 430<00:02:03.180> or<00:02:03.299> 455

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
where they might do maybe a 430 or 455

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.600 
where they might do maybe a 430 or 455
and<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.259> 480<00:02:04.649> so<00:02:04.890> it's<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.130> Bing<00:02:05.340> Bing<00:02:05.579> Bing

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
and a 480 so it's a Bing Bing Bing

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.380 
and a 480 so it's a Bing Bing Bing
instead<00:02:06.600> of<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:06.780> mmm<00:02:07.849> you<00:02:08.849> know<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.060> just<00:02:09.090> kind

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
instead of a mmm you know it just kind

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.680 
instead of a mmm you know it just kind
of<00:02:09.509> covered<00:02:09.929> all<00:02:10.200> of<00:02:10.410> it

of covered all of it

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.990 
of covered all of it
and<00:02:10.810> it<00:02:11.020> really<00:02:11.500> can<00:02:11.860> truly<00:02:12.160> draws<00:02:12.640> the<00:02:12.850> best

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
picture I've ever seen technology now

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.770 
picture I've ever seen technology now
with<00:02:15.340> the<00:02:15.460> so<00:02:15.670> nards<00:02:16.060> and<00:02:16.210> Garmin's<00:02:16.510> bringing

with the so nards and Garmin's bringing

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.960 
with the so nards and Garmin's bringing
forth<00:02:17.020> is<00:02:17.230> just<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:18.070> best<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:18.580> best<00:02:18.820> I've

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
ever seen I feel like we're leading the

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.760 
ever seen I feel like we're leading the
way<00:02:21.580> right<00:02:21.850> now<00:02:22.030> so<00:02:22.450> I'm<00:02:22.990> just<00:02:23.170> excited<00:02:23.500> about

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
way right now so I'm just excited about

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.080 
way right now so I'm just excited about
using<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.100> product<00:02:24.430> when<00:02:24.520> excited<00:02:24.910> about

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
using the product when excited about

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.520 
using the product when excited about
fishermen<00:02:25.750> getting<00:02:26.020> out<00:02:26.110> there<00:02:26.320> and<00:02:26.350> seeing

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
fishermen getting out there and seeing

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.980 
fishermen getting out there and seeing
the<00:02:27.430> differences<00:02:28.060> of<00:02:28.090> what<00:02:28.360> Garmin<00:02:28.720> is<00:02:28.780> doing

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
the differences of what Garmin is doing

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.130 
the differences of what Garmin is doing
right<00:02:29.170> now<00:02:29.200> it's<00:02:29.590> really<00:02:30.040> cool<00:02:31.050> the<00:02:32.050> other

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
right now it's really cool the other

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.010 
right now it's really cool the other
thing<00:02:32.410> is<00:02:32.590> the<00:02:32.830> power<00:02:33.040> of<00:02:33.310> these<00:02:33.430> transducers

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
thing is the power of these transducers

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.390 
thing is the power of these transducers
some<00:02:35.020> of<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.170> competition<00:02:35.800> out<00:02:35.950> there<00:02:35.980> has

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
some of the competition out there has

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.800 
some of the competition out there has
different<00:02:36.880> ways<00:02:37.060> they<00:02:37.240> configure<00:02:37.660> their

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
different ways they configure their

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.270 
different ways they configure their
transducers<00:02:38.410> the<00:02:38.440> Garmin<00:02:38.950> really<00:02:39.160> took

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
transducers the Garmin really took

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.770 
transducers the Garmin really took
advantage<00:02:39.430> of<00:02:39.820> some<00:02:39.880> of<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:40.240> some<00:02:40.600> of<00:02:40.630> the

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
advantage of some of the some of the

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.300 
advantage of some of the some of the
loopholes<00:02:40.960> that<00:02:41.380> some<00:02:41.950> of<00:02:42.040> these<00:02:42.100> other

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
loopholes that some of these other

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.700 
loopholes that some of these other
companies<00:02:43.000> have<00:02:43.210> forgot<00:02:43.960> about<00:02:44.230> or<00:02:44.410> maybe<00:02:44.560> not

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.710 
companies have forgot about or maybe not

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.310 
companies have forgot about or maybe not
paid<00:02:44.890> attention<00:02:45.160> to<00:02:45.450> in<00:02:46.450> a<00:02:46.510> nutshell<00:02:46.720> the

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
paid attention to in a nutshell the

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.220 
paid attention to in a nutshell the
Garmin<00:02:47.680> transducer<00:02:48.250> has<00:02:48.490> a<00:02:48.760> left<00:02:49.420> transducer

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
Garmin transducer has a left transducer

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.320 
Garmin transducer has a left transducer
a<00:02:50.440> right<00:02:50.650> transducer<00:02:51.340> and<00:02:51.520> a<00:02:51.670> bottom<00:02:52.000> sending

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
a right transducer and a bottom sending

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.570 
a right transducer and a bottom sending
transducer<00:02:52.930> so<00:02:53.620> that<00:02:53.770> sends<00:02:54.100> and<00:02:54.280> receives

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
transducer so that sends and receives

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.150 
transducer so that sends and receives
the<00:02:55.300> information<00:02:55.900> which<00:02:56.350> is<00:02:56.380> a<00:02:56.500> much<00:02:56.710> powerful

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
the information which is a much powerful

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.790 
the information which is a much powerful
signal<00:02:57.760> than<00:02:58.690> anything<00:02:58.870> else<00:02:59.140> out<00:02:59.380> there<00:02:59.410> so

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
signal than anything else out there so

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.230 
signal than anything else out there so
as<00:02:59.950> I'm<00:03:00.070> shooting<00:03:00.280> a<00:03:00.490> right<00:03:00.670> signal<00:03:01.120> it's

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 
as I'm shooting a right signal it's

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.150 
as I'm shooting a right signal it's
shooting<00:03:01.540> full-strength<00:03:01.990> to<00:03:02.230> the<00:03:02.320> right<00:03:02.500> full

down which again when you scale your

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.650 
down which again when you scale your
units<00:03:08.200> out<00:03:08.500> to<00:03:08.770> 100<00:03:09.310> feet<00:03:09.520> 150<00:03:10.090> feet<00:03:10.240> 200<00:03:10.630> feet

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.930 
units out to 100 feet 150 feet 200 feet
you're<00:03:11.260> not<00:03:11.380> losing<00:03:11.680> any<00:03:11.980> or<00:03:12.130> sensitivity<00:03:12.790> way

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
you're not losing any or sensitivity way

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.970 
you're not losing any or sensitivity way
out<00:03:13.180> far<00:03:13.510> so<00:03:13.780> I<00:03:13.840> can<00:03:14.020> really<00:03:14.200> scan<00:03:14.530> farther

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
out far so I can really scan farther

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.440 
out far so I can really scan farther
it's<00:03:15.340> gonna<00:03:15.459> draw<00:03:15.730> a<00:03:15.760> better<00:03:16.030> picture<00:03:16.270> and

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
it's gonna draw a better picture and

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.240 
it's gonna draw a better picture and
it's<00:03:16.690> a<00:03:16.750> more<00:03:16.930> powerful<00:03:17.140> transducer

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
it's a more powerful transducer

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.240 
it's a more powerful transducer
now<00:03:18.790> let's<00:03:19.030> move<00:03:19.209> over<00:03:19.360> to<00:03:19.660> the<00:03:19.780> mouse<00:03:20.190> one<00:03:21.190> of

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
now let's move over to the mouse one of
