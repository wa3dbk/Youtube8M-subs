width<00:03:00.620> depth<00:03:01.450> so<00:03:02.450> i<00:03:02.540> used<00:03:02.750> a<00:03:02.930> yellow<00:03:03.410> paint

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770 
width depth so i used a yellow paint

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.160 
width depth so i used a yellow paint
brush<00:03:04.010> because<00:03:04.190> it<00:03:04.370> had<00:03:04.490> a<00:03:04.520> similar<00:03:04.970> depth<00:03:05.720> to

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
brush because it had a similar depth to

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.570 
brush because it had a similar depth to

38 inch 6425 drill various heads or bits

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.330 
38 inch 6425 drill various heads or bits
to<00:03:17.480> insert<00:03:18.110> into<00:03:18.350> the<00:03:18.500> drill<00:03:18.800> so<00:03:19.040> you<00:03:19.100> can

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
to insert into the drill so you can

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.230 
to insert into the drill so you can
actually<00:03:19.520> drill<00:03:20.230> a<00:03:21.230> large<00:03:22.190> one<00:03:22.460> for<00:03:23.120> the

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:23.240 
actually drill a large one for the

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:28.060 
actually drill a large one for the
camera<00:03:23.570> opening<00:03:25.150> for<00:03:26.150> this<00:03:26.680> that's<00:03:27.680> about<00:03:28.010> the

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
camera opening for this that's about the

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.730 
camera opening for this that's about the
size<00:03:28.460> of<00:03:28.880> your<00:03:28.940> camera<00:03:29.600> camera<00:03:30.020> sizes<00:03:30.530> differ

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:30.740 
size of your camera camera sizes differ

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.290 
size of your camera camera sizes differ
so<00:03:31.220> you'll<00:03:31.640> have<00:03:31.760> to<00:03:31.850> figure<00:03:32.060> that<00:03:32.240> out

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
so you'll have to figure that out

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.770 
so you'll have to figure that out
yourself<00:03:32.630> and<00:03:33.140> a<00:03:33.830> small<00:03:34.250> one<00:03:34.280> i<00:03:34.790> used<00:03:35.480> a

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
yourself and a small one i used a

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:43.480 
yourself and a small one i used a
quarter<00:03:36.710> inch<00:03:37.720> drill<00:03:38.720> bit<00:03:38.780> for<00:03:39.740> the<00:03:41.230> insert<00:03:42.490> so

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:43.490 
quarter inch drill bit for the insert so

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.990 
quarter inch drill bit for the insert so
you<00:03:43.580> can<00:03:43.910> put<00:03:44.330> the<00:03:44.630> tripod<00:03:45.500> head<00:03:45.770> inside<00:03:46.670> of

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
you can put the tripod head inside of

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.390 
you can put the tripod head inside of
the<00:03:47.660> cassette<00:03:48.410> holder<00:03:49.270> i<00:03:50.380> also<00:03:51.380> used<00:03:52.010> a

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
the cassette holder i also used a

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.140 
the cassette holder i also used a
threader<00:03:53.240> a<00:03:53.740> quarter-inch<00:03:54.740> threader<00:03:55.250> for<00:03:56.090> the

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
threader a quarter-inch threader for the

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.330 
threader a quarter-inch threader for the
small<00:03:56.450> hole<00:03:56.690> so<00:03:57.320> that<00:03:57.350> it<00:03:57.650> could<00:03:57.830> tightly

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
small hole so that it could tightly

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.450 
small hole so that it could tightly
screw<00:03:58.850> into<00:03:59.120> the<00:03:59.450> tripod<00:03:59.930> head<00:04:00.170> if<00:04:00.460> your

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:01.460 
screw into the tripod head if your

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.060 
screw into the tripod head if your
tripod<00:04:02.000> head<00:04:02.210> just<00:04:02.450> sticks<00:04:03.320> right<00:04:03.620> in<00:04:03.830> there

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070 
tripod head just sticks right in there

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.220 
tripod head just sticks right in there
then<00:04:04.880> that's<00:04:05.090> fine<00:04:05.210> you<00:04:05.660> don't<00:04:05.720> have<00:04:05.840> to<00:04:06.080> use<00:04:06.200> a

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
then that's fine you don't have to use a

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.770 
then that's fine you don't have to use a
threader<00:04:06.670> but<00:04:08.170> it's<00:04:09.170> just<00:04:09.560> not<00:04:09.650> as<00:04:09.980> secure

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
threader but it's just not as secure

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.600 
threader but it's just not as secure
without<00:04:11.780> the<00:04:12.110> threader<00:04:12.380> you<00:04:13.010> just<00:04:13.250> know<00:04:13.459> that

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
without the threader you just know that

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:15.640 
without the threader you just know that
it's<00:04:13.790> going<00:04:14.000> to<00:04:14.180> stick<00:04:14.450> on<00:04:14.600> if<00:04:14.780> you<00:04:14.900> thread<00:04:15.380> the

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
it's going to stick on if you thread the

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.430 
it's going to stick on if you thread the
whole<00:04:16.070> you've<00:04:16.250> made<00:04:16.489> so<00:04:17.480> let's<00:04:17.959> start<00:04:18.200> this

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
whole you've made so let's start this

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.610 
whole you've made so let's start this
tutorial<00:04:18.970> so<00:04:19.970> first<00:04:20.210> you'll<00:04:20.479> use<00:04:20.870> the<00:04:21.140> rotary

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
tutorial so first you'll use the rotary

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.000 
tutorial so first you'll use the rotary
tool<00:04:22.070> to<00:04:22.790> cut<00:04:23.180> the<00:04:23.600> left<00:04:24.320> and<00:04:24.560> right

sides<00:04:25.130> of<00:04:25.280> the<00:04:25.400> holder<00:04:25.760> not<00:04:26.540> going<00:04:27.170> through

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
sides of the holder not going through

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.190 
sides of the holder not going through
the<00:04:27.650> bottom<00:04:28.100> of<00:04:28.280> the<00:04:28.490> cassette<00:04:28.850> holder<00:04:29.210> so

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
the bottom of the cassette holder so

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.900 
the bottom of the cassette holder so
you'll<00:04:30.500> just<00:04:30.710> cut<00:04:30.980> off<00:04:31.160> the<00:04:31.190> left<00:04:31.640> and<00:04:31.850> right

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
you'll just cut off the left and right

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:34.090 
you'll just cut off the left and right
edges<00:04:32.330> of<00:04:32.600> the<00:04:32.810> cassette<00:04:33.500> tape<00:04:33.680> holder

without<00:04:34.610> going<00:04:34.820> through<00:04:35.060> the<00:04:35.090> bottom<00:04:35.480> you'll

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
without going through the bottom you'll

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.530 
without going through the bottom you'll
also<00:04:36.140> use<00:04:36.470> the<00:04:36.680> rotary<00:04:37.040> tool<00:04:37.460> to<00:04:38.120> smooth<00:04:38.360> off

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:38.540 
also use the rotary tool to smooth off

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.860 
also use the rotary tool to smooth off
the<00:04:38.690> edges<00:04:38.900> of<00:04:39.610> where<00:04:40.610> you've<00:04:40.790> just<00:04:41.060> cut<00:04:41.270> so
