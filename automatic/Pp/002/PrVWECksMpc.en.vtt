it's<00:00:34.320> kind<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.559> hard<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.800> tell<00:00:34.980> on<00:00:35.160> camera<00:00:35.630> you

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
it's kind of hard to tell on camera you

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.389 
it's kind of hard to tell on camera you
know<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.809> lot<00:00:37.110> of<00:00:37.140> nice<00:00:37.410> little<00:00:37.620> details<00:00:38.100> of

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
know a lot of nice little details of

know a lot of nice little details of
course<00:00:38.670> it's<00:00:38.879> simplified<00:00:39.329> it<00:00:39.690> does<00:00:39.870> not<00:00:39.989> have

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
course it's simplified it does not have

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.770 
course it's simplified it does not have
nearly<00:00:40.500> as<00:00:40.800> much<00:00:40.950> molding<00:00:41.489> as<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.879> deluxe<00:00:42.270> but

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
nearly as much molding as the deluxe but

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.590 
nearly as much molding as the deluxe but
what<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.379> has<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:44.160> manages<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.030> be<00:00:45.149> effective

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
what it has it manages to be effective

the power button on top as well the
black<00:01:18.299> windows<00:01:20.659> yeah<00:01:21.659> so<00:01:22.259> that's<00:01:22.409> pretty<00:01:22.860> much

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
black windows yeah so that's pretty much

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.520 
black windows yeah so that's pretty much
all<00:01:23.189> it<00:01:23.310> is<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:24.390> is<00:01:24.540> an<00:01:24.689> activator<00:01:25.080> so<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.439> is

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
all it is it is an activator so it is

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.770 
all it is it is an activator so it is
very<00:01:25.860> simple<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:27.119> fact<00:01:27.330> that<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.630> can

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
very simple and the fact that it can

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.319 
very simple and the fact that it can
roll<00:01:28.619> screaming<00:01:29.280> well<00:01:30.560> cleanly<00:01:31.560> well<00:01:32.329> that's

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
roll screaming well cleanly well that's

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.870 
roll screaming well cleanly well that's
about<00:01:33.540> as<00:01:33.810> much<00:01:33.869> playability<00:01:34.470> as<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:34.979> get<00:01:35.220> so

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
about as much playability as you get so

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.990 
about as much playability as you get so
robot<00:01:36.420> mode<00:01:36.600> now<00:01:37.070> once<00:01:38.070> again<00:01:38.369> I<00:01:38.400> will<00:01:38.670> attempt

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
robot mode now once again I will attempt

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.060 
robot mode now once again I will attempt
to<00:01:39.119> demonstrate<00:01:39.240> Auto<00:01:39.780> morph<00:01:40.110> on<00:01:40.290> camera<00:01:40.829> and

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
to demonstrate Auto morph on camera and

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.310 
to demonstrate Auto morph on camera and
if<00:01:41.189> I<00:01:41.340> remember<00:01:41.850> correctly<00:01:42.240> this<00:01:42.689> is<00:01:42.750> the

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
if I remember correctly this is the

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.859 
if I remember correctly this is the
button<00:01:43.740> in<00:01:43.950> order<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.420> accomplish<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:45.570> on<00:01:45.720> this

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
button in order to accomplish it on this

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.039 
button in order to accomplish it on this
toy<00:01:46.939> bear<00:01:47.939> with<00:01:48.149> me<00:01:48.299> let's<00:01:48.570> see<00:01:48.750> if<00:01:48.810> this

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
toy bear with me let's see if this

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.899 
toy bear with me let's see if this
actually<00:01:49.079> works<00:01:50.329> all<00:01:51.329> right<00:01:51.530> hey<00:01:52.909> that

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
actually works all right hey that

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.539 
actually works all right hey that
actually<00:01:53.939> worked<00:01:54.420> fairly<00:01:54.659> well<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:55.320> little<00:01:56.189> bit

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
actually worked fairly well a little bit

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.789 
actually worked fairly well a little bit
to<00:01:56.729> do<00:01:56.909> straighten<00:01:57.570> out<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.840> arms<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:58.530> little

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
to do straighten out the arms a little

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.100 
to do straighten out the arms a little
bit<00:01:58.979> here<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.670> you<00:02:00.090> do<00:02:00.299> have<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.600> fold<00:02:00.960> the

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
bit here and you do have to fold the

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.399 
bit here and you do have to fold the
feet<00:02:01.259> out<00:02:01.439> on<00:02:01.469> your<00:02:01.799> own<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.659> that's<00:02:03.659> a<00:02:03.930> small

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
feet out on your own and that's a small

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.670 
feet out on your own and that's a small
little<00:02:04.920> thing<00:02:05.719> split<00:02:06.719> them<00:02:06.810> out<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:07.170> there<00:02:07.560> we

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
little thing split them out and there we

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
and well for detail I guess that's just

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.060 
and well for detail I guess that's just
about<00:03:30.610> it<00:03:30.970> so<00:03:31.329> how<00:03:31.540> about<00:03:31.690> articulation<00:03:32.560> he

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
about it so how about articulation he

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.520 
about it so how about articulation he
gets<00:03:33.310> the<00:03:33.519> full<00:03:33.760> shoulders<00:03:34.299> two<00:03:34.989> joints<00:03:35.410> to

gets the full shoulders two joints to

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.240 
gets the full shoulders two joints to
allow<00:03:35.829> also<00:03:36.640> these<00:03:36.850> outward<00:03:37.209> shoulders<00:03:37.840> and

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
allow also these outward shoulders and

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.729 
allow also these outward shoulders and
you<00:03:39.250> also<00:03:39.430> get<00:03:39.730> a<00:03:40.000> decent<00:03:40.600> range<00:03:40.870> in<00:03:41.110> the<00:03:41.200> elbow

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
you also get a decent range in the elbow
