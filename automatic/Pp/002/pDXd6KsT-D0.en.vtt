00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.529
 forgive me if I 'm loving you 

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:09.650
 this moment but I need to listen 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:11.940
 something even if it's an instant 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.849
 breathing 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.789
 hello friends today we are going to learn this 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:21.630
 super ballad to pure pain you like the 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.250
 idea well let's go to it before let me 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.009
 I invite you to subscribe to my channel 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.590
 diva guitar so you'll be aware of 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:30.509
 all the news said that 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.210
 let's start learning the stanza 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:36.410
 the first chord that we find is 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.410
 this one of greater 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:42.410
 and about art we want in this way 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:45.170
 who remembers you with a fourth thumb with 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:49.250
 second and third index with ring finger 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.840
 and half and again fourth with index and 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.300
 we already have the arpeggio that we are going to 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.840
 use throughout the stanza look 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.840
 Y 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.680
 once it comes out we can continue 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.699
 forward then we have already the first 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.699
 chord that is greater 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.520
 then we went to the accord of major song 

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:16.119
 and we do the same space giving in 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.119
 fifth string 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.350
 now the minor 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.670
 and we went to mini minor this time the 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.200
 arpeggio is the same but we give with thumb 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.200
 on the sixth string 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.490
 now fa greater 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.490
 new 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:46.990
 now we are going bigger and we finish in sunshine 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.990
 major with tonic on sixth string 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.870
 look at it this way we already have what 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.350
 it's the verse we're going to play together 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.920
 non-stop 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.920
 but 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.630
 the least now my mind 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.180
 my minor 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.660
 for more 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.350
 when greater 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.350
 and the sun 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:20.080
 easy not that not twice and 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.080
 then enter what is the bridge 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.280
 and the bridge is easier because 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.830
 make price 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:34.100
 just start giving the least and give 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.920
 two hits down two radios 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:40.160
 changes the next one that are greater 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:43.390
 Regios below is now greater the Regios 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.700
 down and the reviewer 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.750
 and that's the whole bridge, look, I'm 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.750
 very the least 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.100
 and 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.850
 agonizing the minor 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.770
 and only me 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:02.140
 to greater 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.860
 and now we come to the refrain that 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.860
 you know how it sounds 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.600
 I was serious 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.270
 new 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.480
 the chords you use here are 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.939
 practically stanza and 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.730
 rhythm that he makes is only strokes towards 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:26.409
 down like on the bridge we're going to touch it 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.370
 slowly and you will see how easy 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:29.370
 starting 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.930
 I am portland 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:41.630
 by F major 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.630
 I 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:52.250
 my ways are not greater orlando 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.250
 single 

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:56.219
 normal 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.540
 ah 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:03.569
 the greatest 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.430
 and start all over again and nothing friends 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:07.980
 we have the whole subject so 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.019
 simple now what I recommend is 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.450
 that you see the video demonstration and put 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:14.159
 in practice everything you 've learned if 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:18.919
 you liked remember to like 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:18.919
 and subscribe to the channel until later
