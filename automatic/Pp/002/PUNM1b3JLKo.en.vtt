00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.489
 the tablets surfing the web are ipads 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.470
 but since I already know that this is not what 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:59.470
 they care more and directly to the 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:02.619
 announcements of the event the first announcement 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:05.019
 was the long-awaited iphone5 which in 

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:07.510
 reality was nothing new because everyone 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:10.210
 the rumors or most of them were 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.250
 true how can you observe the exterior 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.560
 of the device is the one that leaked 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.470
 for months and in terms of their 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.430
 internal characteristics 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.030
 he mentioned 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:25.720
 the iphone5 weighs only 112 grams and is 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:28.000
 18% thinner than the iphone 4s 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.940
 the size of the screen is 4 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.880
 inches and has retina display is 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:37.630
 say that its resolution is 1,136 x 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:40.270
 640 pixels the iphone 5 supports 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.980
 lte speeds with any company 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.080
 have this service around 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.420
 of the world 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.600
 the processor that gives life to this new 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.400
 iphone is a 6 designed by apple in the 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.460
 event mentioned that this processor 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:57.520
 It is twice faster than both a5 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.400
 in general performance as in graphs in 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.470
 regarding the life time in the battery 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:05.140
 apparently is pretty good support 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:09.340
 8 hours talking 8 hours surfing the 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:12.940
 web either in 3g or at speeds lte 10 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:16.450
 hours on wifi 10 hours watching video 40 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:19.780
 hours listening to music and 225 hours in 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.060
 standby the rear camera continues 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.310
 There is still an 8 - megapixel site 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.020
 but now it has some new 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.930
 characteristics that help to take 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:31.750
 better photos like panorama mode by 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:35.620
 example this camera also records video 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.570
 in 1080p at 30 frames per second and the 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.700
 front camera is now 1.2 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:43.390
 megapixels and is capable of recording video 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.880
 in hd that is 720 p 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.770
 the connector of this new iphone also 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.690
 change is what you are seeing in 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.690
 screen and as you have already noticed 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:55.000
 now it is quite smaller and by 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.330
 last mentioned that the iphone 5 is 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.540
 ready for ios 6 and this led to 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.310
 next topic of event ios 6 in 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.170
 reality there was nothing new to what already 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.540
 they had shown us in their last event 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:11.110

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.270
 jóve 6 on the iphone 5 some of the 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:16.810

 match results for example 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.600
 Then they showed some videos in 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.489
 around the creation of the iphone 5 and 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:34.330
 basically this was all about the 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:36.519
 new iphone and ios 6 by the way the 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.530
