00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:04.230
 here 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.769
 in the last red carpets we are 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.380
 watching quite simple styles and 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:12.630
 very easy to do 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.030
 then today oscar and juan 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.470
 Carlos is going to teach us how to make one 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.470
 of these styles and even 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.320
 so we can 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:35.650
 to negotiate the hair is to the 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.920
 talked to a dryer I like 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.920
 very much 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.440
 have this bright, luminous appearance 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.940
 It is very important for you to be able to 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.640
 do what 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.090
 late night day let's find a 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.090
 small 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.150
 I believe that all women can 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.150
 take out all 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:12.280
 It helps a lot to give you a lot more 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.560
 enhance the face as they mark 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.189
 very much the face but now we are going to 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.189
 make a 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:19.189
 3 

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:26.190
 before 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.390
 hair and use 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.390
 before they contain 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.090
 that all 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:40.880
 and the second serum for hair 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:45.230
 that polish nourish and make 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:48.909
 tips have a lot more resistance 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:53.579
 We're going to all our hair 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:56.640
 take to the side of the right side 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.960
 depending on what you like 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.210
 exactly what is your angle because that 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.659
 it's very important right now that they have 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.659
 all your 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.399
 or better 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:19.530
 with what you have and see what is the side 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.800
 what works best for you to give that 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.800
 side 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.880
 as well 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.180
 the special teeth so that you 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:39.599
 hair no 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.599
 be damaged we have a very interesting idea 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.300
 but what 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:53.349
 we have to do that is 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:55.800
 mess with a league in leagues that do not 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:55.800
 be 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:07.069
 of stationery that are not used so that 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:09.079
 be seen 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:11.030
 the objector's hair is already mentioned 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:14.239
 What I really liked is that after 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:16.340
 that the press is structured 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:19.909
 other titles for the nights that are 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:22.879
 makes clear it is that I have the 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:25.579
 custom of that as it simulates towards me 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:27.650
 I make the hair rolls then the 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:29.810
 At the moment what I loose it is a 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.700
 little with a different texture that does not 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.140
 necessarily it is the violation or 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:37.440
 Knowing it, it seems that you 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:42.360
 I have it but then he looks father 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:46.470
 because it looks like a big baby 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:51.420
 that it really seems that you only 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:53.450
 with the combed hands they have removed it 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.220
 carpet 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:59.310
 and 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:03.120
 nicole kidman also 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:06.540
 Morrison too 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.540
 it's a version 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:11.860
 It is very important that you remember 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:14.780
 that if your hair is wavy or that it is or 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.640
 it is not necessary that they do 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.380
 completely we will also have to respect 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:21.290
 the structure of your hair that is left 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:26.080
 perfectly straight from the middle of your 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:26.080
 skull of your head back 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.849
 it does not have to be done 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.249
 it is also something 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:35.080
 you do not want to go mark it touches me for the 

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:37.979
 trend but suggests the 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:40.719
 trends that is not a braid 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:42.550
 completely pure also also 

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:44.709
 that have to be up here below 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.479
 forget oscar he did half of me he 

00:04:44.709 --> 00:04:48.580
 makes me be here not what they should 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:50.969
 be very careful is in the 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.189
 terminations already when 

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:57.919
 when it's completely closed 

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:57.919
 braid here has a league 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.990
 Y 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:05.920
 a fork what 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.920
 and search 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:15.980
 good girls in summary step 1 is spoken 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:19.670
 already perfectly fine in step number 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:22.520
 2 Let's make volume by doing a little 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:25.280
 of crepe from this part backwards is a 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.500
 number 3 we pull all the hair towards the 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.810
 cost that we want in this case is 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:32.330
 to the right side as number 4 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.100
 we started to braid remember that the 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.200
 braid can start and you can finish 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:38.169
 where you want and can be from 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:40.900
 as wide as you want 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:44.969
 now now his number 4 we are going to put 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.969
 a league a league 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:51.280
 obscura in your case in a case of jessica 

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:52.580
 dark and we will try our 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.879
 hair 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:58.669
 step number 5 let's put some here 

00:05:55.879 --> 00:06:00.860
 pins for if we have crimes 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:06.580
 loose now clear this is also very 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:08.379
 cute that's optional and step number 6 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:11.259
 let's put a small detail like 

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:13.639
 some pins with swarovski or some 

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:16.150
 type of accessory 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:16.150
 and ready
