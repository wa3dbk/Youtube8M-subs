00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
this step step step cross drop drop drop

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.240 
this step step step cross drop drop drop
drop<00:01:26.380> step<00:01:27.220> step<00:01:27.640> step<00:01:27.880> cross<00:01:29.010> it's<00:01:30.010> very

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
drop step step step cross it's very

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.010 
drop step step step cross it's very
simple<00:01:30.610> I<00:01:30.729> mean<00:01:30.790> it<00:01:30.970> looks<00:01:31.090> very<00:01:31.300> simple<00:01:31.540> but<00:01:31.659> a

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
simple I mean it looks very simple but a

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.300 
simple I mean it looks very simple but a
lot<00:01:32.350> of<00:01:32.380> people<00:01:32.470> get<00:01:32.740> these<00:01:32.860> views<00:01:33.100> on<00:01:33.220> the

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
lot of people get these views on the

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:34.890 
lot of people get these views on the
footwork<00:01:33.640> so<00:01:34.120> I'm<00:01:34.210> going<00:01:34.450> to<00:01:34.510> break<00:01:34.690> it<00:01:34.870> down

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 
footwork so I'm going to break it down

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.480 
footwork so I'm going to break it down
what<00:01:35.500> would<00:01:35.590> do<00:01:35.740> in<00:01:35.890> here<00:01:36.010> is<00:01:36.100> pretty<00:01:36.370> much

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
what would do in here is pretty much

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.050 
what would do in here is pretty much
route<00:01:36.760> walk<00:01:37.030> in<00:01:37.240> sideways<00:01:37.830> but<00:01:38.830> um<00:01:39.159> it's<00:01:39.850> very

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
route walk in sideways but um it's very

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.370 
route walk in sideways but um it's very
important<00:01:40.390> you<00:01:40.420> know<00:01:40.600> which<00:01:40.780> way<00:01:40.960> to<00:01:41.020> start

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
important you know which way to start

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.140 
important you know which way to start
with<00:01:41.590> and<00:01:41.799> I<00:01:41.860> think<00:01:41.920> that's<00:01:42.310> where<00:01:42.640> probably

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150 
with and I think that's where probably

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.600 
with and I think that's where probably
most<00:01:43.510> people<00:01:43.750> get<00:01:43.900> confused<00:01:44.080> if<00:01:44.770> we<00:01:44.950> are<00:01:45.220> if

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610

left<00:01:52.810> foot<00:01:53.049> is<00:01:53.200> facing<00:01:53.380> forward<00:01:54.150> that<00:01:55.150> people

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
left foot is facing forward that people

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:56.969 
left foot is facing forward that people
were<00:01:55.510> here<00:01:55.780> you<00:01:56.260> would<00:01:56.380> want<00:01:56.619> to<00:01:56.650> start<00:01:56.740> with

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
were here you would want to start with

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:58.710 
were here you would want to start with
your<00:01:57.100> left<00:01:57.250> foot<00:01:57.520> and<00:01:58.030> I<00:01:58.210> think<00:01:58.390> if<00:01:58.479> you<00:01:58.570> start

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
your left foot and I think if you start

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.120 
your left foot and I think if you start
with<00:01:58.840> the<00:01:58.930> wrong<00:01:59.140> one<00:01:59.320> then<00:01:59.500> that's<00:01:59.890> where<00:02:00.070> the

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
with the wrong one then that's where the

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.340 
with the wrong one then that's where the
confusion<00:02:00.369> starts<00:02:00.670> so<00:02:01.030> let's<00:02:01.690> break<00:02:02.110> it<00:02:02.229> down

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
confusion starts so let's break it down

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.289 
confusion starts so let's break it down
so<00:02:02.650> why<00:02:03.250> don't<00:02:03.400> you<00:02:03.490> focus<00:02:03.640> forward<00:02:03.940> I'm<00:02:04.119> going

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299

footwork<00:05:27.210> to<00:05:27.630> move<00:05:27.870> so<00:05:28.080> I<00:05:28.169> just<00:05:28.380> find<00:05:28.620> is

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130 
footwork to move so I just find is

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:30.980 
footwork to move so I just find is
exactly<00:05:29.610> the<00:05:29.760> same<00:05:29.970> movies<00:05:30.240> a<00:05:30.270> traveling<00:05:30.810> move

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
exactly the same movies a traveling move

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:49.580 
it's nice and hot and learn really quick
and<00:05:48.210> it<00:05:48.300> takes<00:05:48.479> only<00:05:48.660> one<00:05:48.900> cast<00:05:49.139> it's<00:05:49.380> got<00:05:49.500> to

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
and it takes only one cast it's got to

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:52.190 
and it takes only one cast it's got to
be<00:05:49.650> a<00:05:49.680> best<00:05:50.330> switch<00:05:51.330> from<00:05:51.690> the<00:05:51.810> back<00:05:51.990> to<00:05:52.169> the

be a best switch from the back to the

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.409 
be a best switch from the back to the
front<00:05:52.410> so<00:05:52.789> that's<00:05:53.789> the<00:05:53.940> breakdown<00:05:54.120> the

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:54.419 
front so that's the breakdown the

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:56.180 
front so that's the breakdown the
