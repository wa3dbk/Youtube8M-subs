a 1066 is a perfect balance between
simplicity<00:01:02.160> comfort<00:01:03.160> and<00:01:03.490> speed<00:01:03.820> we<00:01:04.540> really

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:04.840 
simplicity comfort and speed we really

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:09.560 
simplicity comfort and speed we really
try<00:01:05.080> to<00:01:05.110> make<00:01:05.500> a<00:01:05.530> family<00:01:06.040> boat<00:01:07.530> easy<00:01:08.530> to<00:01:08.800> handle

try to make a family boat easy to handle

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.890 
try to make a family boat easy to handle
but<00:01:10.570> still<00:01:10.950> going<00:01:11.950> fast<00:01:12.310> but<00:01:12.850> safe<00:01:13.120> very

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
but still going fast but safe very

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.430 
but still going fast but safe very
important<00:01:14.440> the<00:01:15.070> two<00:01:15.250> helm<00:01:15.490> stations<00:01:16.030> are

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
important the two helm stations are

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.050 
important the two helm stations are
close<00:01:17.440> to<00:01:17.620> the<00:01:17.800> mass<00:01:17.979> so<00:01:18.280> all<00:01:18.460> the<00:01:18.610> maneuvers

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
close to the mass so all the maneuvers

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.860 
close to the mass so all the maneuvers
are<00:01:19.300> very<00:01:20.229> close<00:01:20.560> to<00:01:20.770> each<00:01:21.030> other<00:01:22.030> so<00:01:22.540> you<00:01:22.630> can

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:22.870 
are very close to each other so you can

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.810 
are very close to each other so you can
do<00:01:23.080> everything<00:01:23.380> you<00:01:23.710> you<00:01:24.280> can<00:01:24.460> maneuver

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
do everything you you can maneuver

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.020 
do everything you you can maneuver
really<00:01:25.150> from<00:01:25.450> the<00:01:26.009> steering<00:01:27.009> station<00:01:27.640> and<00:01:27.850> the

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
really from the steering station and the

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.480 
really from the steering station and the
cockpit<00:01:28.479> is<00:01:28.630> really<00:01:29.050> big<00:01:29.460> mostly<00:01:30.460> because

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
cockpit is really big mostly because

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.540 
cockpit is really big mostly because
outside<00:01:31.240> areas<00:01:31.900> are<00:01:32.229> where<00:01:32.259> you<00:01:32.590> are<00:01:32.619> really

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.550 
outside areas are where you are really

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.330 
outside areas are where you are really
when<00:01:33.729> you're<00:01:33.880> selling<00:01:34.119> in<00:01:34.720> sunny<00:01:35.560> places<00:01:35.890> and

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
when you're selling in sunny places and

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.100 
when you're selling in sunny places and
the<00:01:36.850> whole<00:01:37.030> are<00:01:37.240> designed<00:01:37.690> for<00:01:38.520> speed<00:01:39.520> but

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
the whole are designed for speed but

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.340 
the whole are designed for speed but
with<00:01:41.110> our<00:01:41.619> ranks<00:01:42.100> so<00:01:42.420> both<00:01:43.420> is<00:01:43.750> really<00:01:44.110> see

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
with our ranks so both is really see

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.060 
with our ranks so both is really see

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
where C and unsafe the other thing which

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.890 
where C and unsafe the other thing which
was<00:01:48.190> important<00:01:48.670> also<00:01:48.820> is<00:01:49.060> true<00:01:49.090> is<00:01:49.479> true<00:01:49.720> of

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
and now of cruising with here is very

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.600 
and now of cruising with here is very
important<00:01:59.830> for<00:01:59.920> a<00:02:00.010> boat<00:02:00.130> like<00:02:00.280> that<00:02:00.340> because

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
important for a boat like that because

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.620 
important for a boat like that because
there<00:02:00.880> is<00:02:01.000> both<00:02:01.710> in<00:02:02.710> 1066<00:02:03.340> that<00:02:03.880> is<00:02:04.000> the

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
there is both in 1066 that is the

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.020 
there is both in 1066 that is the
performance<00:02:05.280> aspect<00:02:06.280> which<00:02:06.729> is<00:02:06.850> very

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
performance aspect which is very

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.570 
performance aspect which is very
important<00:02:07.450> but<00:02:08.260> also<00:02:08.470> the<00:02:08.679> simplicity<00:02:09.250> of<00:02:09.280> the

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
important but also the simplicity of the

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.280 
important but also the simplicity of the
of<00:02:09.970> the<00:02:10.119> maneuver<00:02:10.420> of<00:02:10.570> the<00:02:10.720> boat<00:02:10.869> and<00:02:10.899> the

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
of the maneuver of the boat and the

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.930 
of the maneuver of the boat and the
layout<00:02:11.470> and<00:02:11.920> the<00:02:12.330> comfort<00:02:13.330> and<00:02:14.640> when<00:02:15.640> you<00:02:15.760> work

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
possible we have some tables rather than

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:40.310 
possible we have some tables rather than
Finn<00:02:37.600> kills<00:02:37.900> because<00:02:38.260> it's<00:02:38.709> more<00:02:39.010> efficient

the<00:02:41.320> mast<00:02:41.560> is<00:02:41.890> stepped<00:02:42.670> quite<00:02:43.090> back<00:02:43.410> so<00:02:44.430> the

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
the mast is stepped quite back so the

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.610 
the mast is stepped quite back so the
mainsail<00:02:46.030> has<00:02:46.209> a<00:02:46.239> very<00:02:46.780> high<00:02:47.019> aspect<00:02:47.470> ratio

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
mainsail has a very high aspect ratio

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.990 
mainsail has a very high aspect ratio
very<00:02:48.370> efficient<00:02:49.320> while<00:02:50.320> the<00:02:50.549> forward<00:02:51.549> cell<00:02:51.820> is

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
very efficient while the forward cell is

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.410 
very efficient while the forward cell is

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
on a self backing track so it's easy to

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.570 
on a self backing track so it's easy to
handle<00:02:55.870> you<00:02:56.410> just<00:02:56.680> have<00:02:56.860> to<00:02:56.890> turn<00:02:57.190> the<00:02:57.400> hill

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580
