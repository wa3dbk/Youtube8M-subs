00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.570
 or 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.520
 with wet hair make two 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:40.090
 divisions on top of the 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.670
 head to delimit the sides use 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:45.220
 babylisspro supermotor machine with 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.580
 Cutting guide number 1 to perform 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.019
 all the contour of the head 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:52.480
 cutting in ascending form and 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:54.790
 using the cutting comb increases 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.640
 the length of the hair of half a head 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.559
 up creating an angle so that 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:10.930
 the machine separates from the head 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:13.210
 gradually once all the 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.700
 outline remove the cutting guide number 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:19.770
 1 and use the machine technique on 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.770
 Comb to polish the entire contour 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:33.619
 I took from the upper front section 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:36.479
 a horizontal partition at 90 degrees 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:39.659
 slightly tilted to the front and with 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:42.329
 the straight fingers start cutting this 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.219
 tilt will create an asymmetry the 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.259
 length will vary according to the cut that 

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:50.149
 want to perform for this case it 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.149
 they calculate about 6 to 8 centimeters 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.770
 take from the upper rear section 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:02:00.090
 a horizontal partition at 90 degrees with 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:02.280
 the affected fingers and start cutting the 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:11.670
 length will be similar to that of the section 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:14.190
 frontal comb the entire section 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.099
 top to one side and cut in 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.140
 straight line on fingers and then we do 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.620
 the same but combing to the side 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.620
 contrary 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:55.110
 with the first stage of babylisspro with 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.450
 the bird blade 501 determination 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.940
 first polish the top of the 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.830
 hair and then texture and doing 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.220
 small angular cuts on the 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.220
 tips 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.519
 to finalize brand and in prolific 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:01.420
 there are never contours and I know that with dryer 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:01.420
 shaping 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.060
 because I
