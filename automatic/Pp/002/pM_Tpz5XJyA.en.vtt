00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
looks really nice if you can keep the

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.010 
looks really nice if you can keep the
gaps<00:01:23.369> between<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:24.060> frames<00:01:24.330> kind<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.750> small

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
gaps between the frames kind of small

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.620 
gaps between the frames kind of small
and<00:01:25.350> because<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.430> photo<00:01:26.820> itself<00:01:27.210> isn't<00:01:27.540> gonna

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
and because the photo itself isn't gonna

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.319 
and because the photo itself isn't gonna
be<00:01:27.810> all<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.020> large<00:01:28.409> adding<00:01:29.280> this<00:01:29.400> big<00:01:29.460> border

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
be all that large adding this big border

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.300 
be all that large adding this big border
around<00:01:30.479> it<00:01:30.869> kind<00:01:31.079> of<00:01:31.229> emphasizes<00:01:32.009> it<00:01:32.159> and

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
around it kind of emphasizes it and

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.969 
around it kind of emphasizes it and
makes<00:01:32.850> it<00:01:32.970> more<00:01:33.119> impressive<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:33.840> of<00:01:34.770> course
