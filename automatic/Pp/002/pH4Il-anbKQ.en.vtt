00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:13.950
 and always with respect and respect 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:17.560
 the rib cage muscles 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.970
 what we are seeing at this moment 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.970
 very protective 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.539
 eternal 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.430
 Y 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:43.150
 First 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:44.870
 therefore this is the 1 is very good 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.490
 gave a handlebar 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.560
 party 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.330
 we have internal spaces here 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.210
 such certain spaces are protected 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.140
 or rather 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:59.790
 they are covered by the muscles 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:02.100
 postcards we do not have there 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:05.000
 these intercostal numbers are three 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.000
 as we already mentioned 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.990
 very good the external internal medium 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.260
 boys look 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.260
 we can see one 

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:19.219
 i 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.840
 internal intercostal muscle 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:38.460
 they go from top to bottom and from 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.310
 outside in or inside out 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.510
 outside 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.510
 if you put in your normal position 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.750
 let's go into the middle I would be ahead and 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.790
 External will cost you later 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.800
 all right 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:00.500
 we have here the wall interpret external 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:06.700
 look at not the fibers if you raised it 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.700
 let's see here the figure of some 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.500
 on the contrary 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.810
 we must walk constant binter as the 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.459
 pita 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.459
 abroad where constant dwells 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.560
 the chestnut 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.560
 here we are going to see the light 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.290
 or do you want to do better 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.830
 of the state 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:13.570
 at the bottom edge 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.570
 by lower rib 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.300
 this artery 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:30.760
 let's see if the nerve 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.760
 Excuse that artery 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:41.640
 there is the broken vein if they can 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:44.370
 approach and see there the vein 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.190
 because the head was a vein that is 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.170
 broken 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.450
 so here we have the one above 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.760
 nerve will always have what they will 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.960
 see as a vitality 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.550
 nothing else the task is a little more tubular 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.210
 and they see it is much thinner and 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.210
 crushed 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:07.000
 well there is the intercostal bath edge 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:10.710
 inferior of hostility 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.710
 lower edge of the rib 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.180
 and it's here on the inner side 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.070
 of the rib cage 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.810
 This muscle is called muscle 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.490
 triangular sternum 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.669
 triangular of the sternum has a form 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.669
 triangular 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.930
 is a muscle which extends the 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:43.110
 third fourth and fifth rib plus or 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:45.690
 less on his inner face towards the face 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.400
 posterior of the sternum body and the 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.949
 back face of property and youth 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.690
 the triangular muscle reservation 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:53.610
 inconstant rather said that is in 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.280
 involution there are new structures 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.760
 anatomical in the human body that already 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.760
 they are leaving 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:05.300
 here is the muscle in fragma ya miren 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:08.480
 about please all all do not know 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:11.260
 think do not be afraid do not think or 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.260
 disgust so vote 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:19.480
 the diaphragm muscle in this muscle is 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:21.790
 a flattened muscle that has 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.990
 a dome that divides the thorax from 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.730
 abdomen 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.950
 the main muscle of respiration 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:30.760
 because when this muscle was found 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:35.500
 will rise or be obeyed 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:36.790
 the answer is because when we inspire 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.300
 and the similar moment we have to 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:42.160
 expand then it would not be good then 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:46.180
 I would not have what 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:51.150
 flatten yourself to tell us expand it 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:51.150
 expand the vertical diameter 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:58.260
 without any problem 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:58.260
 very well 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.249
 We're going to look for him here in 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:08.789
 the spherical 

00:06:05.249 --> 00:06:11.339
 where are you preached to see here is very 

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:12.929
 well that's the phrenic nerve and look 

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:15.749
 how it reaches the diaphragm look how 

00:06:12.929 --> 00:06:18.409
 fragma would arrive and the phrenic nerve will 

00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:21.589
 originates from either fresh level 

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:23.300
 of the original cervical region of the 

00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:27.080
 branches of the final nerve branches 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:31.580
 spinals said 3 6 4 and 6 5 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:33.649
 ok c3 c4 and 5 especially 6 4 6 4 is the 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:37.119
 that gives more first descendants and they are 

00:06:33.649 --> 00:06:37.119
 2 preached right 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:49.550
 my project and I want that in this one 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:49.550
 very good very good 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:56.280
 it does not surprise better than this 

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:56.280
 but no 

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:03.180
 s 

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:13.850
 very well we said that the diaphragm are 

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:15.650
 two domes right left the 

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:17.990
 right is higher because of who 

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:21.310
 because the liver looks instigated 

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:21.310
 what liver 

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:24.810
 this patient 

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:31.730
 tell me 

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:34.250
 with his holiness 

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:39.740
 it's hard 

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:39.740
 small could fibrous two modules 

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:50.380
 very good guys any question 

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:50.380
 today's question no
