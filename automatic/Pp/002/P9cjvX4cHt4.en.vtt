00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
eyeball and paste it right there now

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.850 
eyeball and paste it right there now
it's<00:01:33.210> kind<00:01:33.509> of<00:01:33.630> hard<00:01:33.900> because<00:01:33.960> this<00:01:34.380> eyeball

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
it's kind of hard because this eyeball

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.330 
it's kind of hard because this eyeball
has<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.100> weird<00:01:35.490> bottom<00:01:35.939> but<00:01:36.900> once<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:37.650> dries<00:01:37.979> you

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
has a weird bottom but once it dries you

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.770 
has a weird bottom but once it dries you
can<00:01:38.369> just<00:01:38.729> glue<00:01:38.970> around<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:40.939> so<00:01:41.939> it's<00:01:42.390> nice<00:01:42.750> and

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
can just glue around it so it's nice and

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:51.109 
can just glue around it so it's nice and
secured

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.940 

so<00:01:52.119> we<00:01:52.750> have<00:01:52.869> to<00:01:52.990> make<00:01:53.020> sure<00:01:53.229> that<00:01:53.530> doesn't

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
so we have to make sure that doesn't

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.410 
so we have to make sure that doesn't
come<00:01:54.100> off<00:01:54.220> now<00:01:54.820> we're<00:01:55.000> going<00:01:55.119> to<00:01:55.210> wait<00:01:55.390> for

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
come off now we're going to wait for

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.539 
come off now we're going to wait for
that<00:01:55.720> to<00:01:55.750> dry<00:01:57.270> so<00:01:58.270> once<00:01:58.630> it's<00:01:58.900> dried<00:01:59.369> we<00:02:00.369> are

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549 
that to dry so once it's dried we are

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:02.310 
that to dry so once it's dried we are
going<00:02:00.820> to<00:02:01.180> get<00:02:01.390> whatever<00:02:01.630> you<00:02:01.840> want<00:02:01.960> to<00:02:02.170> make
