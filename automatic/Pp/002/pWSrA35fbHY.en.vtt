00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.200
 the channel will be shopping will hang you 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.910
 interesting let's start the first thing i'm 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.800
 I want to show you this here this dress 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.809

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.660
 from the shop be free and she is very me 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.000
 like it shows daisies like you 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.189
 see we serve the first time I saw 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.310
 thought well yes the daisy type came in 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:28.050
 fitting room and think what is drawn here 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:30.269
 eggs that whether the dress is such a 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.270
 lac 's broad principle goes it needs to 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.120
 wear but I would be in Tallinn like this 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.960
 already but not to that extent well 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.750
 belt using 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.300
 I prefer to wear school 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.390
 soon it is inevitable if u did not want 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.489
 will forgive me but myself but soon these 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.110
 schools and again and all this routine 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.750
 repeat and constantly need to be 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.710
 wear you built term clothes like this 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.020
 official style 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.510
 thatâ€™s not usually 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.149
 stuck but see how it will be in 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.699
 this year and bought a mango on discounts 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.369
 here is a black dress 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.680
 big not right land dry poland me 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.140
 it seems that but a little bit not under my height 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.260
 that is, you have to pay gave it somehow 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.990
 she is not completely at me with the sew I would 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.750
 said and whether you need shoes with heels 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.290
 Lyakova is that I do not wear shoes and not 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.150
 I know what I'm going to do with it 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:27.360
 the next thing that manga bought 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.180
 again on discounts this is such a well 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.490
 i can call her blouse and like to 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.200
 it is that it is without any clasp 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.210
 that here and here again zip up on the very 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.659
 Indeed, just such a neckline is visible for 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.460
 convenience so that the word tailoring was and adore 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.409
 simple tons of stuff because to them 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.009
 you can add decoration there printers 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:49.110
 something else then i don't know minimalism 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.990
 such a straight general what next I want 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.740
 tell it such a top from the store and 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.140
 cinder 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.000
 he sales footage and wet a little bit well 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.340
 sorry sorry again like about 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.950
 blouse want to say that it is full 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.689
 minimalism and this one fits everything 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.090
 whether it's just a great thing 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:09.390
 I honestly want to take more of these 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.610
 Tops of other colors are just 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.930
 because universal cool 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.790
 this top is right my love is love and 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.190
 I advise everyone to everyone to everyone 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.740
 very long and I wanted 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.260
 you found it than demi and even if not 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:28.080
 found from simply he didn't mean it 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.270
 say bought it and very glad i'm afraid 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.460
 that I will be out of our summer 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.470
 to wear because it is much less than not 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.370
 like he doesn't like top and in general 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:40.140
 like everything 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:42.420
 and I'm afraid choupette will be enough for school 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.670
 the next thing I can show is this 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.520
 Well, the type of summer shopping this blouse out 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:50.160
 shop on ember I really liked 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.020
 here and drawn such birds somewhere 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.610
 they 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:57.200
 dyed black somewhere just vodka 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:03:00.390
 such a white minka T-shirt 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.580
 literally really like the following it 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.670
 Jeans from the bershka shop 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.020
 simple jeans very simple jeans 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.350
 Now there is generally already everywhere with 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.940
 high waist but of course not 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.590
 missing the opportunity to buy this 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.120
 high waist because I really 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.070
 like in this life on inflated 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.650
 waist was buying 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.840
 pawns somehow black no no no 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.850
 liked before buying those black i 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.370
 heard someone have a high waist 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:29.190
 falls I thought damn how it is possible 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.680
 lower out if something to subside but I 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.750
 I am convinced of this from my personal experience 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.810
 you buy the same rake myself 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:39.450
 blue jeans but that's another model and 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:42.630
 These jeans and very loved because 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:46.200
 that they keep perfect at the waist straight 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:49.170
 generally perfect they do not fall down not 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.150
 delaying like this list a little but here 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.810
 tolerable and generally normal to wear 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.460
 they are very cool advise if you find 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.310
 watch them try on maybe you 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:01.470
 also suitable but also be careful 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.080
 because again not pawns bought up 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.910
 this is also high waist jeans i 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.920
 he is not as I said I liked 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:11.480
 you connect what I wanted you today 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:16.430
 would say it like that 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:19.040
 how are they called slipons in my thing 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.169
 very comfortable and nothing is just him and 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:24.020
 minimalism as you see and to everything 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:26.979
 fits again here this video was 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:30.290
 you are interested and possibly useful 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:34.870

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.870
