buy brand new one and do it again in PvE
it's<00:02:55.799> pretty<00:02:56.069> pointless<00:02:56.400> your<00:02:56.549> weapon<00:02:56.819> to<00:02:56.940> use

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970

just<00:02:57.480> because<00:02:57.720> papering<00:02:58.140> is<00:02:58.260> so<00:02:58.470> good<00:02:58.709> but

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
just because papering is so good but

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.940 
just because papering is so good but
it's<00:02:59.459> a<00:02:59.610> perfect<00:03:00.150> pvp<00:03:00.720> gun<00:03:00.959> unless<00:03:01.410> you're

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
it's a perfect pvp gun unless you're

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.699 
it's a perfect pvp gun unless you're
using<00:03:02.129> Hawkmoon<00:03:02.849> then<00:03:03.540> this<00:03:03.840> is<00:03:04.049> the<00:03:04.200> gun<00:03:04.379> to

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709
