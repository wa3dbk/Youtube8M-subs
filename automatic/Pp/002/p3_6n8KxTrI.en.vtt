00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.260
 Well hello guys to distinguish from 45 cm 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.500
 and in this video I will share with you 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.360
 interesting information long ago entered on 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.029
 my channel video modern tanks 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.590
 lessons so now you see 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:22.350
 screencast like from time to time 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:26.279
 tank walks on our map what is it 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.800
 means that maybe our tanks will 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.980
 introduced and modern machines what is it 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.110
 means pipets all that's what it means like 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.059
 reported by developers maybe not 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.440
 11 levels will appear in the tree trail 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.180
 may not be sold for 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.059
 huge amount of words or will 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.210
 explore I'm telling you if they lead 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.100
 these modern machines of our groups then i 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.180
 sure 50 percent of the players 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.160
 may leave and still come the same 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.760
 because it will be a slag game just 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.399
 will fly away 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.840
 not clear where but in principle I would not 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.710
 against ride on his tank 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.969
 to pound 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.239
 because he will be first 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:06.140
 super duper booked him no one 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.930
 will punch it will be generally powerful 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.790
 everyone will be around and apart from him 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.049
 see here we are interesting developments 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.729
 now see the secret videos and 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:19.380
 the developers are reporting what is going on here 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.900
 it is exactly the work necessary these here we go yet 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.880
 like a guy there is something with 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:28.140
 we cut out but I still make a comment 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.030
 ready why we do not have global 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.070
 update why do people sit and do 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.530
 modern tanks you see in models 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.200
 He looks on the Internet there designing 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.390
 where are our normal tanks why tanks 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.540
 World War II is still half 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.659
 don't lead excuse me what are they doing there 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.399
 we wait means damn half a year even 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.290
 a few years already waiting until hevik 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.640
 they will appear there modern tanks mold 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.420
 and we are not shown anything 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.740
 tells it generally interesting 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.090
 worked for them is not at all clear no 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.579
 to stella immediately all normal 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.780
 translate the game to another engine there 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:05.640
 may lose something a little but the process 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.190
 then progress will be there but they 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.119
 do see see other things behind 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.610
 draw time 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.200
 the tanks that we see probably can 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.930
 be even your kids see only 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.569
 eldest why I do not know what he is there 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.190
 engaged but interesting project that I 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.920
 I can say very beautiful picturesque 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:26.430
 tanks right it will make 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.260
 new chip once the threat of fear but I personally 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.829
 would recommend to developers 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:34.799
 made a separate client and made it 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:36.780
 these are interesting tanks in 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:38.700
 another hotel is not a client from the game started 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.489
 there will be chaos because 1 st level to 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:45.420
 man need we will play then 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:47.579
 in it is not clear that yes and such here 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.739
