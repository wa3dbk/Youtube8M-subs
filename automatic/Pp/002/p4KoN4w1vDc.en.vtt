 hello to everyone as today'll 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:12.000
 teach to put the points on the needle 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:16.890
 knitting in a way that is not necessary 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.810
 do that first lap are some of the 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.810
 our points get quite wide 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.730
 in the center and pulls it 's all a matter of 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:23.040
 practice 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:44.280
 Let's go after we need ten. 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:45.150
 points and give one to the first 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.900

00:02:48.900 --> 00:03:03.840

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.109
 the normal ones you want 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:23.849
 this way super easy on the needle does not 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:35.250
 It does not have this 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:37.500
 points because I'm pine to be more 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.040
