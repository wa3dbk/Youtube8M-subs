important it is for companies to run

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.760 
important it is for companies to run
betas<00:00:44.480> especially<00:00:45.480> when<00:00:46.020> it's<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.289> brand<00:00:46.620> new

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
unfinished version of the game and you

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.740 
unfinished version of the game and you
give<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.309> developers<00:00:56.820> your<00:00:57.000> feedback<00:00:57.539> so

this<00:01:01.440> would<00:01:01.590> be<00:01:01.620> better<00:01:01.890> if<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.160> did<00:01:02.340> this<00:01:02.489> as

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
this would be better if you did this as

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.729 
this would be better if you did this as
this<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.120> this<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.449> it's<00:01:03.960> also<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.379> find<00:01:04.589> out

the game has and deal with them in the

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.590 
the game has and deal with them in the
beta<00:01:10.290> before<00:01:11.189> you<00:01:11.280> actually<00:01:11.520> release<00:01:12.240> the

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
beta before you actually release the

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.910 
beta before you actually release the
game<00:01:12.750> cuz<00:01:13.020> when<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.260> release<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.770> game

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
game cuz when you release the game

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.920 
game cuz when you release the game
there's<00:01:14.189> more<00:01:14.520> people<00:01:14.880> playing<00:01:15.119> it<00:01:15.390> people

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
there's more people playing it people

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.450 
there's more people playing it people
have<00:01:16.049> paid<00:01:16.229> for<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.590> people<00:01:16.830> get<00:01:17.040> very<00:01:17.070> mad

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
have paid for it people get very mad

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.520 
have paid for it people get very mad
when<00:01:17.759> stuff<00:01:17.970> doesn't<00:01:18.000> work<00:01:18.390> when<00:01:19.170> they<00:01:19.290> paid

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
when stuff doesn't work when they paid

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.499 
when stuff doesn't work when they paid
for<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:20.009> so<00:01:20.040> it's<00:01:20.310> very<00:01:20.640> good<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:21.030> hold<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.360> beta

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
for it so it's very good to hold of beta

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.480 
for it so it's very good to hold of beta
and<00:01:21.840> kind<00:01:22.229> of<00:01:22.320> iron<00:01:22.680> out<00:01:22.799> all<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.040> kinks

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
and kind of iron out all the kinks

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.760 
and kind of iron out all the kinks
before<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:24.090> actually<00:01:24.299> release<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.259> game<00:01:25.470> and

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
before you actually release the game and

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.190 
before you actually release the game and
it<00:01:26.640> seems<00:01:26.850> like<00:01:26.970> betas<00:01:27.479> are<00:01:27.630> actually

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
it seems like betas are actually

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.660 
it seems like betas are actually
becoming<00:01:28.409> more<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:28.950> more<00:01:29.070> common<00:01:29.430> for

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
becoming more and more common for

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.310 
becoming more and more common for
console<00:01:30.420> games<00:01:30.600> which<00:01:30.780> is<00:01:30.930> really<00:01:31.140> really

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
console games which is really really

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.620 
console games which is really really
really<00:01:31.500> good<00:01:31.710> I<00:01:31.890> like<00:01:32.189> that<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.430> lot<00:01:32.880> like<00:01:33.509> I

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
really good I like that a lot like I

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:34.819 
really good I like that a lot like I
said<00:01:33.689> especially<00:01:33.990> for<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.530> brand<00:01:34.770> new

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
said especially for a brand new

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.800 
said especially for a brand new
franchise<00:01:35.369> because<00:01:35.610> if<00:01:35.939> you<00:01:36.060> hold<00:01:36.390> an<00:01:36.659> open

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
franchise because if you hold an open

when<00:02:07.229> people<00:02:07.500> have<00:02:07.860> betas<00:02:08.429> cuz<00:02:08.700> like<00:02:08.819> I<00:02:08.970> said

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
when people have betas cuz like I said

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.760 
when people have betas cuz like I said
it's<00:02:09.360> only<00:02:09.569> a<00:02:09.810> very<00:02:10.110> general<00:02:10.739> idea<00:02:11.129> of<00:02:11.220> just

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
it's only a very general idea of just

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.190 
it's only a very general idea of just
people<00:02:12.100> are<00:02:12.190> interested<00:02:12.700> it's<00:02:12.910> not<00:02:13.450> a<00:02:13.750> very

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
people are interested it's not a very

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.590 
people are interested it's not a very
specific<00:02:14.740> number<00:02:15.640> of<00:02:15.820> how<00:02:16.000> many<00:02:16.030> people<00:02:16.210> are

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
specific number of how many people are

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.860 
specific number of how many people are
interested<00:02:16.750> so<00:02:17.500> people<00:02:17.530> usually<00:02:18.040> always<00:02:18.520> have

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
interested so people usually always have

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.390 
interested so people usually always have
server<00:02:19.870> issues<00:02:20.410> when<00:02:20.590> a<00:02:20.620> game<00:02:20.830> first<00:02:21.100> comes

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
server issues when a game first comes

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.150 
server issues when a game first comes
out<00:02:21.610> but<00:02:22.120> it<00:02:22.360> definitely<00:02:22.630> helps<00:02:23.440> you<00:02:23.650> to<00:02:23.950> have

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
out but it definitely helps you to have

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.310 
out but it definitely helps you to have
less<00:02:24.520> of<00:02:24.730> a<00:02:24.820> chance<00:02:24.850> of<00:02:25.420> having<00:02:25.630> all<00:02:25.900> of<00:02:25.960> these

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
less of a chance of having all of these

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.220 
less of a chance of having all of these
release<00:02:26.860> date<00:02:27.220> issues<00:02:27.790> when<00:02:28.420> you<00:02:28.540> hold<00:02:28.780> a<00:02:28.960> beta

release date issues when you hold a beta

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.850 
release date issues when you hold a beta
now<00:02:29.800> if<00:02:30.070> call<00:02:30.430> of<00:02:30.640> duty<00:02:31.090> was<00:02:31.600> to<00:02:31.630> hold<00:02:32.200> a<00:02:32.470> beta

of beta they wanted to do all of these
things<00:02:37.750> that<00:02:38.320> we<00:02:38.440> found<00:02:38.680> were<00:02:39.010> overpowered<00:02:39.820> or

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
things that we found were overpowered or

that we didn't like in the game that a

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
about that before they release the game

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.090 
about that before they release the game
because<00:02:49.660> what<00:02:49.810> happens<00:02:50.260> is<00:02:50.380> that<00:02:50.440> people<00:02:50.590> it

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
generous genuine issue and then the

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.090 
generous genuine issue and then the
developers<00:03:01.900> have<00:03:02.080> to<00:03:02.260> hear<00:03:02.560> about<00:03:02.590> it<00:03:02.860> which

developers have to hear about it which

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.220 
developers have to hear about it which
takes<00:03:03.370> what<00:03:03.670> another<00:03:04.090> month<00:03:04.450> and<00:03:04.750> then<00:03:05.110> it

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
takes what another month and then it

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.480 
takes what another month and then it
takes<00:03:05.410> them<00:03:05.710> some<00:03:05.920> time<00:03:06.100> to<00:03:06.160> actually

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.490 
takes them some time to actually

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.480 
takes them some time to actually
implement<00:03:07.210> that<00:03:07.600> into<00:03:08.170> the<00:03:08.410> game<00:03:08.650> so<00:03:09.280> by<00:03:09.460> the

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:09.490 
implement that into the game so by the

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.610 
implement that into the game so by the
time<00:03:09.670> you<00:03:10.390> actually<00:03:10.600> release<00:03:11.200> the<00:03:11.350> game<00:03:11.440> it's

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
time you actually release the game it's

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.560 
time you actually release the game it's
probably<00:03:11.830> like<00:03:11.980> four<00:03:12.340> months<00:03:12.910> until<00:03:13.030> we're

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
probably like four months until we're

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.360 
probably like four months until we're
dealing<00:03:13.900> with<00:03:13.930> any<00:03:14.140> issues<00:03:14.830> unless<00:03:15.010> it's<00:03:15.280> a

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
dealing with any issues unless it's a

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.460 
dealing with any issues unless it's a
major<00:03:15.670> exploit<00:03:16.540> of<00:03:16.750> the<00:03:16.900> game<00:03:17.080> they'll<00:03:17.290> deal

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
major exploit of the game they'll deal

with that really quickly but if it's

very<00:04:02.950> encouraged<00:04:03.760> by<00:04:04.060> the<00:04:04.120> news<00:04:04.450> that

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
very encouraged by the news that

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.140 
very encouraged by the news that
titanfall<00:04:05.350> is<00:04:05.770> having<00:04:06.310> an<00:04:06.430> alpha<00:04:06.880> test

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
titanfall is having an alpha test

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.610 
titanfall is having an alpha test
because<00:04:07.510> what<00:04:07.690> it<00:04:07.780> shows<00:04:07.989> me<00:04:08.200> is<00:04:08.320> that<00:04:08.470> they're

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
because what it shows me is that they're

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.740 
because what it shows me is that they're
open<00:04:09.100> the<00:04:09.220> stuff<00:04:09.430> like<00:04:09.640> that<00:04:09.670> they're<00:04:10.330> holding

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
open the stuff like that they're holding

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.330 
open the stuff like that they're holding
tests<00:04:11.080> they're<00:04:11.320> wanting<00:04:11.590> to<00:04:11.709> test<00:04:11.980> the<00:04:12.160> game

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
tests they're wanting to test the game

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.550 
tests they're wanting to test the game
before<00:04:12.940> it<00:04:13.209> comes<00:04:13.480> out<00:04:13.690> so<00:04:13.959> what<00:04:14.140> it<00:04:14.230> tells<00:04:14.380> me

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
before it comes out so what it tells me

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.580 
before it comes out so what it tells me
is<00:04:15.090> title<00:04:16.090> fall<00:04:16.239> beta<00:04:16.480> confirmed<00:04:16.900> confirmed

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
is title fall beta confirmed confirmed

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:18.900 
is title fall beta confirmed confirmed
right<00:04:18.100> here<00:04:18.310> right

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
right here right

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.910 
right here right
I<00:04:19.330> mean<00:04:19.780> it<00:04:19.870> makes<00:04:19.989> sense<00:04:20.110> right<00:04:20.500> they're

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:20.920 
I mean it makes sense right they're

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.680 
I mean it makes sense right they're
having<00:04:21.070> an<00:04:21.280> alpha<00:04:21.670> test<00:04:21.910> their<00:04:22.180> open<00:04:22.510> having

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
having an alpha test their open having

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.240 
having an alpha test their open having
an<00:04:22.870> alpha<00:04:23.080> test<00:04:23.290> I<00:04:23.500> think<00:04:23.890> it<00:04:23.980> makes<00:04:24.100> sense

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
an alpha test I think it makes sense

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.460 
an alpha test I think it makes sense
that<00:04:24.490> they're<00:04:24.850> going<00:04:25.060> to<00:04:25.180> eventually<00:04:25.690> have<00:04:26.020> a

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
that they're going to eventually have a

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:27.990 
that they're going to eventually have a
beta<00:04:26.710> and<00:04:26.950> I<00:04:27.010> think<00:04:27.220> it's<00:04:27.310> a<00:04:27.400> very<00:04:27.580> good<00:04:27.700> idea

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
beta and I think it's a very good idea

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.640 
beta and I think it's a very good idea
for<00:04:28.330> them<00:04:28.450> to<00:04:28.570> do<00:04:28.690> that<00:04:28.840> because<00:04:29.230> there<00:04:29.500> is<00:04:29.620> a

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
for them to do that because there is a

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.010 
for them to do that because there is a
lot<00:04:30.040> of<00:04:30.070> pressure<00:04:30.400> and<00:04:30.700> a<00:04:31.090> lot<00:04:31.330> of<00:04:31.360> height<00:04:31.720> on

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
lot of pressure and a lot of height on

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.920 
lot of pressure and a lot of height on
EA<00:04:32.620> respawn<00:04:33.310> and<00:04:33.460> titanfall<00:04:33.850> so<00:04:34.450> they<00:04:34.660> need<00:04:34.840> to

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
EA respawn and titanfall so they need to

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.260 
EA respawn and titanfall so they need to
make<00:04:35.080> sure<00:04:35.110> that<00:04:35.560> it's<00:04:35.680> as<00:04:35.860> smooth<00:04:36.190> as<00:04:36.430> humanly

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
make sure that it's as smooth as humanly

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.440 
make sure that it's as smooth as humanly
possible<00:04:37.410> when<00:04:38.410> it<00:04:38.530> does<00:04:38.740> release<00:04:39.340> so<00:04:40.000> let<00:04:40.420> me

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450 
possible when it does release so let me

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:41.790 
possible when it does release so let me
know<00:04:40.540> in<00:04:40.630> the<00:04:40.750> comments<00:04:41.170> section<00:04:41.200> guys<00:04:41.590> would

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.680
