00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.070
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.039
 creative with newsprint my name is 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.160
 Ines and I would like to show you today how 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.740
 It's quite easy in a maximum of ten 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.710
 minutes in a great poinsettia 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:38.930
 made of newspaper what the tank to 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.930
 we need first of course 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:51.390
 would be a ruler and cling that is 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.710
 Everything he needs more needs 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.399
 he me and then it can already 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.870
 start 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.870
 make your rich here 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:09.060
 for the beginning with 2 for the chronicle 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:16.490
 offices for the basic course of ten sterns 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:16.490
 centimeter again our first click 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:27.000
 then cemented again 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.000
 do 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:30.579
 18 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.679
 up 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:44.150
 Now the train is a local politician 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.150
 prolonged delay over emotion 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.960
 Well 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:00.490
 Let's say such a little accordion 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:03.299
 and now we can set the framework for 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.299
 the stars 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.390
 comes under 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:24.000
 that we are important to our basic structure 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:28.590
 now that you look that thighs 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.680
 the star could all be even today 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:38.490
 so push it all out 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:42.950
 Gives you know this now theoretically 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.950
 I also measure it 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:50.900
 so that does not slip again 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.900
 fix her that super clear 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:03:00.190
 and there is the backbone and then you can 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:02.750
 it already with the bad news 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.150
 and now you put in the 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:10.310
 always one at a time 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:12.440
 loop up from top to bottom again 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:20.950
 and then next tip with yours 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:20.950
 German again high 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:34.220
 around the beginning of the homburg and to the 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:36.340
 next peak here made the cold 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.340
 Weather 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:45.349
 the bend around the top and to the 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.349
 next peak 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.890
 So we can make the clear agreement too 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:57.890
 we have that already stable 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:12.099
 and now we do the same 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.610
 We continue to work all the way to the middle 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:17.919
 and make sure that the 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:20.280
 cross struts of the star always parallel to 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:20.280
 to change 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.750
 no matter what 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:52.139
 We do that in parallel now 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.139
 continue 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.870
 ours is finished except for that 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.319
 stick 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.819
 it still has to be glued on 

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:41.830
 now even cut off and piece 

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:44.289
 Then we put this here for no 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:46.120
 Better stop, I stick it but still 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:48.569
 then it can not be again 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.569
 rise up 

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:05.950
 engage 

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:14.420
 and fix with a clamp until the 

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:18.320
 Cured is a hero and cured 

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:20.450
 finished is a star that can now 

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:23.760
 to be painted 

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:28.170
 decorated Christmas whichever 

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:31.680
 for what you wanted to use next 

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:35.370
 you can for example the window 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:37.380
 hang as a beautiful window decoration or 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:40.290
 for the christmas tree or you can him 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:42.480
 also uses as a candlestick looks 

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:45.500
 wonderful that tremendous creativity 

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:48.180
 no limits at all 

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:51.720
 I wish you quite a lot 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:54.870
 fun while tinkering and make you 

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:56.550
 It's just as much fun as never me 

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:57.750
 Hope to see you again soon and 

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:03.560
