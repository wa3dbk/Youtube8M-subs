00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
start you don't have a lot of time to

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.570 
start you don't have a lot of time to
settle<00:00:36.170> yourself<00:00:36.350> in<00:00:36.800> and<00:00:36.980> there<00:00:37.400> are<00:00:37.430> a<00:00:37.490> lot

settle yourself in and there are a lot
of<00:00:37.610> things<00:00:37.850> that<00:00:37.970> you<00:00:38.060> need<00:00:38.210> to<00:00:38.240> think<00:00:38.390> about

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
of things that you need to think about

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.170 
of things that you need to think about
so<00:00:41.030> I<00:00:41.740> usually<00:00:42.740> have<00:00:42.890> either<00:00:43.100> a<00:00:43.460> list<00:00:43.850> printed

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
so I usually have either a list printed

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.610 
so I usually have either a list printed
in<00:00:44.390> front<00:00:44.600> of<00:00:44.690> me<00:00:44.810> or<00:00:44.960> a<00:00:45.020> list<00:00:45.170> in<00:00:45.350> my<00:00:45.380> header

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
in front of me or a list in my header

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.320 
in front of me or a list in my header
they<00:00:45.770> go<00:00:45.920> through<00:00:46.130> and<00:00:46.310> one<00:00:46.940> of<00:00:47.060> the<00:00:47.120> main

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:47.330 
they go through and one of the main

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.930 
they go through and one of the main
things<00:00:47.980> first<00:00:48.980> thing<00:00:49.130> is<00:00:49.250> what<00:00:49.430> once<00:00:49.760> you're

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
things first thing is what once you're

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.240 
things first thing is what once you're
lined<00:00:50.180> up<00:00:50.560> you<00:00:51.560> need<00:00:51.650> to<00:00:51.770> be<00:00:51.890> in<00:00:51.950> the<00:00:52.040> correct

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
lined up you need to be in the correct

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.970 
lined up you need to be in the correct
gear<00:00:52.570> I've<00:00:53.570> had<00:00:53.870> situations<00:00:54.110> where<00:00:54.770> my

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
gear I've had situations where my

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.680 
gear I've had situations where my
reverse<00:00:55.340> gear<00:00:55.580> is<00:00:55.700> actually<00:00:55.850> right<00:00:56.270> next<00:00:56.600> to

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
reverse gear is actually right next to

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.140 
reverse gear is actually right next to
my<00:00:56.810> first<00:00:57.050> gear<00:00:57.320> so<00:00:57.850> luckily<00:00:58.850> it<00:00:58.940> was<00:00:59.030> in

00:00:59.140 --> 00:00:59.150 
my first gear so luckily it was in

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:00.760 
my first gear so luckily it was in
practice<00:00:59.510> but<00:00:59.690> I<00:00:59.720> launched<00:01:00.110> in<00:01:00.200> Reverse<00:01:00.500> which

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 
practice but I launched in Reverse which

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.830 
practice but I launched in Reverse which
is<00:01:00.890> a<00:01:00.920> bit<00:01:01.130> embarrassing<00:01:01.640> a<00:01:01.790> couple<00:01:02.540> times<00:01:02.690> I

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
is a bit embarrassing a couple times I

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.810 
is a bit embarrassing a couple times I
launched<00:01:03.140> in<00:01:03.230> second<00:01:03.560> by<00:01:03.650> mistake<00:01:04.009> there<00:01:04.729> are

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
launched in second by mistake there are

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.370 
launched in second by mistake there are
a<00:01:04.850> few<00:01:05.000> guys<00:01:05.180> with<00:01:05.360> the<00:01:05.420> fast<00:01:05.659> fast<00:01:05.930> cars<00:01:06.170> that

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
a few guys with the fast fast cars that

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.710 
a few guys with the fast fast cars that
will<00:01:06.530> launch<00:01:06.680> in<00:01:06.890> second<00:01:07.220> on<00:01:07.310> purpose<00:01:07.720> but

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
will launch in second on purpose but

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:09.899 
will launch in second on purpose but
that's<00:01:08.869> another<00:01:09.079> story

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909 
that's another story

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:16.029 
that's another story
so<00:01:12.640> once<00:01:13.640> you<00:01:14.320> get<00:01:15.320> to<00:01:15.469> the<00:01:15.590> start<00:01:15.859> line

00:01:16.029 --> 00:01:16.039 
so once you get to the start line

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:17.800 
so once you get to the start line
you<00:01:16.670> have<00:01:16.820> your<00:01:16.999> tree<00:01:17.210> that<00:01:17.390> you<00:01:17.450> need<00:01:17.570> to<00:01:17.659> pay

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
you have your tree that you need to pay

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.580 
you have your tree that you need to pay
attention<00:01:18.020> to<00:01:18.549> our<00:01:19.549> trees<00:01:19.850> have<00:01:20.350> two<00:01:21.350> lights

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
attention to our trees have two lights

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.410 
attention to our trees have two lights
at<00:01:21.950> the<00:01:22.100> top<00:01:22.310> for<00:01:22.520> the<00:01:22.579> stage<00:01:22.850> and<00:01:22.999> pre<00:01:23.179> stage

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
at the top for the stage and pre stage

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.050 
at the top for the stage and pre stage
that<00:01:23.749> lines<00:01:23.960> you<00:01:24.109> up<00:01:24.289> we<00:01:25.039> then<00:01:25.189> have<00:01:25.460> three

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
that lines you up we then have three

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.359 
that lines you up we then have three
orange<00:01:26.420> lights<00:01:26.659> green<00:01:27.590> light<00:01:27.770> and<00:01:27.979> a<00:01:28.340> red

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
orange lights green light and a red

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:30.370 
orange lights green light and a red
light<00:01:28.759> red<00:01:29.420> light<00:01:29.479> is<00:01:29.780> if<00:01:29.929> you<00:01:30.049> jumped<00:01:30.319> me

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
light red light is if you jumped me

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.910 
light red light is if you jumped me
start<00:01:31.240> now<00:01:32.240> here<00:01:32.630> in<00:01:32.749> barbatus<00:01:33.140> we<00:01:33.409> do<00:01:33.499> a<00:01:33.530> 1/8

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
start now here in barbatus we do a 1/8

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.660 
start now here in barbatus we do a 1/8
mile<00:01:34.189> and<00:01:34.460> our<00:01:35.299> reaction<00:01:35.929> time<00:01:36.200> it's<00:01:37.039> a<00:01:37.219> the

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
mile and our reaction time it's a the

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.039 
mile and our reaction time it's a the
best<00:01:37.909> reaction<00:01:38.359> time<00:01:38.509> you<00:01:38.600> could<00:01:38.719> have<00:01:38.749> is<00:01:39.020> a

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049 
best reaction time you could have is a

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:42.160 
best reaction time you could have is a
0.0<00:01:39.979> flat<00:01:40.490> your<00:01:41.210> other<00:01:41.359> places<00:01:41.630> in<00:01:41.869> your<00:01:41.960> world

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
0.0 flat your other places in your world

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.719 
0.0 flat your other places in your world
where<00:01:42.380> their<00:01:42.560> best<00:01:42.770> reaction<00:01:43.280> where<00:01:43.549> their

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
where their best reaction where their

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.149 
where their best reaction where their
ideal<00:01:44.090> reaction<00:01:44.600> time<00:01:44.749> is<00:01:44.960> 0.5<00:01:45.770> anything

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
ideal reaction time is 0.5 anything

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.910 
ideal reaction time is 0.5 anything
below<00:01:46.369> that<00:01:46.399> is<00:01:46.700> considered<00:01:47.179> a<00:01:47.270> jump<00:01:47.929> start<00:01:48.200> so

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
below that is considered a jump start so

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.120 
below that is considered a jump start so
just<00:01:49.219> check<00:01:49.579> your<00:01:49.729> rules<00:01:49.969> to<00:01:50.179> make<00:01:50.329> sure<00:01:51.130> so

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
just check your rules to make sure so

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.279 
just check your rules to make sure so
you<00:01:53.090> have<00:01:53.209> your<00:01:53.420> orange<00:01:53.569> lights<00:01:53.899> and<00:01:54.200> they

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:54.289 
you have your orange lights and they

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:55.749

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:02.629 
about anything but what I need to what I

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:04.809 
about anything but what I need to what I
do<00:03:02.750> is<00:03:03.019> I<00:03:03.049> usually<00:03:03.319> sometimes<00:03:04.310> I<00:03:04.519> use<00:03:04.639> launch

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819 
do is I usually sometimes I use launch

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:06.069 
do is I usually sometimes I use launch
control<00:03:04.909> sometimes<00:03:05.629> I<00:03:05.750> don't

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:06.079

I<00:03:06.200> find<00:03:07.040> that<00:03:07.219> anywhere<00:03:07.609> between<00:03:07.849> four<00:03:08.239> and

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
I find that anywhere between four and

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.059 
I find that anywhere between four and
five<00:03:08.389> thousand<00:03:08.870> rpm<00:03:09.260> it's<00:03:09.409> a<00:03:09.469> sweet<00:03:09.680> spot<00:03:09.889> to

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
five thousand rpm it's a sweet spot to

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.470 
five thousand rpm it's a sweet spot to
move<00:03:10.219> off<00:03:10.599> so<00:03:11.599> I<00:03:11.629> set<00:03:11.959> the<00:03:11.989> revs<00:03:12.260> there<00:03:12.530> and

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
move off so I set the revs there and

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.670 
move off so I set the revs there and
then<00:03:14.480> you<00:03:14.569> need<00:03:14.719> to<00:03:14.810> load<00:03:14.989> up<00:03:15.109> your<00:03:15.139> drive<00:03:15.439> line

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
then you need to load up your drive line

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.670 
then you need to load up your drive line
balance<00:03:16.099> your<00:03:16.250> clutch<00:03:16.459> find<00:03:16.849> a<00:03:17.000> biting<00:03:17.329> point

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
balance your clutch find a biting point

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.080 
balance your clutch find a biting point
because<00:03:18.680> you're<00:03:19.159> just<00:03:19.370> going<00:03:19.519> to<00:03:19.609> waste<00:03:19.909> time

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
because you're just going to waste time

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.199 
because you're just going to waste time
if<00:03:20.450> you<00:03:20.950> find<00:03:21.950> the<00:03:22.069> RPM<00:03:22.489> and<00:03:22.760> you<00:03:22.849> have<00:03:23.030> your

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
if you find the RPM and you have your

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.149 
if you find the RPM and you have your
clutch<00:03:23.479> foot<00:03:23.930> sank<00:03:24.409> all<00:03:24.650> the<00:03:24.829> way<00:03:24.919> to<00:03:24.979> the

clutch foot sank all the way to the
floor<00:03:25.370> and<00:03:25.609> then<00:03:26.120> we<00:03:26.209> go<00:03:26.329> to<00:03:26.389> move<00:03:26.569> off<00:03:26.690> you

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
floor and then we go to move off you

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.199 
floor and then we go to move off you
just<00:03:26.930> pop<00:03:27.199> it<00:03:27.229> that<00:03:27.799> that's<00:03:28.099> that's<00:03:28.549> not<00:03:28.790> good

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
just pop it that that's that's not good

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.110 
just pop it that that's that's not good
