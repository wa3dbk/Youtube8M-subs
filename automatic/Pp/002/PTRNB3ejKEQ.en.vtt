00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.449 
back to the game and call the timeout
and<00:03:33.390> save<00:03:33.690> it<00:03:33.870> it's<00:03:34.019> just<00:03:34.290> like<00:03:34.440> coach<00:03:34.680> mode<00:03:34.920> it

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
and save it it's just like coach mode it

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:36.949

still works

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.899 
still works
just<00:03:37.799> because<00:03:38.069> it<00:03:38.159> doesn't<00:03:38.400> have<00:03:38.489> coach<00:03:38.700> mode

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:38.909 
just because it doesn't have coach mode

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:40.699 
just because it doesn't have coach mode
does<00:03:39.090> not<00:03:39.269> mean<00:03:39.450> it<00:03:39.599> doesn't<00:03:39.810> work<00:03:40.049> all<00:03:40.319> you

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
does not mean it doesn't work all you

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.530 
does not mean it doesn't work all you
