charismatic of of Japanese scales that
you<00:02:06.740> have<00:02:07.039> that<00:02:07.310> flat<00:02:07.759> second<00:02:08.390> on<00:02:08.599> it<00:02:15.489> that's<00:02:16.489> a

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
you have that flat second on it that's a

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.140 
you have that flat second on it that's a
very<00:02:16.690> it's<00:02:17.690> an<00:02:17.810> interval<00:02:18.290> that<00:02:18.410> happens<00:02:18.800> in

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
very it's an interval that happens in

very<00:02:20.150> often<00:02:20.450> in<00:02:20.780> Japanese<00:02:21.290> scales<00:02:21.650> and<00:02:22.069> for

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
very often in Japanese scales and for

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:24.309 
very often in Japanese scales and for
some<00:02:23.000> reason<00:02:23.360> when<00:02:23.510> you<00:02:23.599> play<00:02:23.810> the<00:02:23.989> scale<00:02:24.290> a

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
some reason when you play the scale a

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.800 
some reason when you play the scale a
little<00:02:24.530> bit<00:02:24.800> higher<00:02:25.310> up<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:25.790> fretboard<00:02:26.150> you

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810

little bit higher up the fretboard you
can<00:02:26.989> really<00:02:27.349> get<00:02:27.860> that<00:02:28.069> sound<00:02:28.340> of<00:02:28.610> it<00:02:28.730> to<00:02:28.849> come

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
can really get that sound of it to come

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
okay okay so this coke in your she scale

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.810 
okay okay so this coke in your she scale
you<00:02:43.570> just<00:02:43.600> learned<00:02:44.140> if<00:02:44.950> you<00:02:45.190> compared<00:02:45.670> to<00:02:45.760> the

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
you just learned if you compared to the

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.930 
you just learned if you compared to the
scale<00:02:46.180> degrees<00:02:46.690> to<00:02:46.900> the<00:02:47.020> major<00:02:47.290> scale<00:02:47.830> it's<00:02:48.220> 1

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
scale degrees to the major scale it's 1

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.100 
scale degrees to the major scale it's 1
flat<00:02:49.540> 2<00:02:50.050> 4<00:02:50.920> 5<00:02:51.370> and<00:02:51.850> flat<00:02:52.360> 7

flat 2 4 5 and flat 7
he<00:02:53.410> only<00:02:53.620> has<00:02:53.800> these<00:02:53.980> 5<00:02:54.310> notes<00:02:55.470> now<00:02:56.470> I'm<00:02:56.620> going

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
he only has these 5 notes now I'm going

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.850 
he only has these 5 notes now I'm going
to<00:02:56.980> show<00:02:57.220> you<00:02:57.280> another<00:02:57.580> Japanese<00:02:58.540> scale<00:02:58.930> it's

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
to show you another Japanese scale it's

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.910 
to show you another Japanese scale it's
closely<00:03:00.460> related<00:03:01.150> scale<00:03:01.630> to<00:03:01.870> kokino<00:03:02.260> she<00:03:02.500> it's

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
closely related scale to kokino she it's

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.090 
closely related scale to kokino she it's
simply<00:03:03.520> called<00:03:03.760> a<00:03:04.000> four<00:03:04.390> note<00:03:04.720> scale<00:03:05.200> because

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
simply called a four note scale because

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.640 
simply called a four note scale because
we<00:03:06.130> are<00:03:06.460> going<00:03:06.850> to<00:03:06.970> take<00:03:07.210> away<00:03:07.450> the<00:03:07.750> flat<00:03:08.050> 7th

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
we are going to take away the flat 7th

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.600 
we are going to take away the flat 7th
degree<00:03:09.310> of<00:03:09.820> the<00:03:10.810> co<00:03:11.200> kiyoshi<00:03:11.590> scale<00:03:12.070> so<00:03:12.460> you're

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
degree of the co kiyoshi scale so you're

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:18.060 
degree of the co kiyoshi scale so you're
going<00:03:12.940> to<00:03:13.150> have<00:03:13.420> 1<00:03:14.200> flat<00:03:15.010> 2<00:03:15.430> 4<00:03:16.120> 5<00:03:16.840> degrees<00:03:17.800> of<00:03:17.980> a

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
going to have 1 flat 2 4 5 degrees of a

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.070 
going to have 1 flat 2 4 5 degrees of a
major<00:03:18.280> scale<00:03:18.670> just<00:03:18.910> 4<00:03:19.450> tones

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
major scale just 4 tones

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.860 
major scale just 4 tones
hence<00:03:20.650> this<00:03:20.950> scale<00:03:21.280> is<00:03:21.520> called<00:03:21.850> a<00:03:22.090> 4<00:03:22.570> tone

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
hence this scale is called a 4 tone

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.620 
hence this scale is called a 4 tone
scale<00:03:23.350> check<00:03:23.920> this<00:03:24.070> out

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
scale check this out

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.080 
scale check this out
okay<00:03:25.630> so<00:03:25.690> the<00:03:25.960> 4<00:03:26.230> tone<00:03:26.470> scale<00:03:26.920> again<00:03:27.820> as<00:03:28.000> the

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
okay so the 4 tone scale again as the

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.630 
okay so the 4 tone scale again as the
name<00:03:28.300> suggests<00:03:28.870> is<00:03:29.050> only<00:03:29.320> 4<00:03:29.620> notes<00:03:29.920> and<00:03:30.220> it's<00:03:30.550> a

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
name suggests is only 4 notes and it's a

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.360 
name suggests is only 4 notes and it's a
very<00:03:30.880> simple<00:03:31.500> symmetrical<00:03:32.500> pattern<00:03:33.190> check

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
very simple symmetrical pattern check

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:39.930 
very simple symmetrical pattern check
this<00:03:33.490> out

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:49.160 

it's<00:03:40.870> the<00:03:41.020> same<00:03:41.320> little<00:03:41.730> motif<00:03:43.110> this<00:03:44.110> one

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:58.820 

knock-knock

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.760 

it<00:03:59.640> gets<00:03:59.820> nice<00:04:00.030> for<00:04:00.390> a<00:04:00.420> pool<00:04:00.840> off<00:04:01.320> check<00:04:01.620> out

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770 
it gets nice for a pool off check out

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:08.130 
it gets nice for a pool off check out
this<00:04:01.890> lake

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.720 

so<00:04:09.140> it's<00:04:09.260> got<00:04:09.410> a<00:04:09.440> little<00:04:09.650> bit<00:04:09.800> of<00:04:09.920> a<00:04:10.040> cool

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
so it's got a little bit of a cool

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.650 
so it's got a little bit of a cool
eastern<00:04:11.420> sound<00:04:12.670> so<00:04:13.670> let<00:04:13.820> me<00:04:13.940> let<00:04:14.330> me<00:04:14.360> show<00:04:14.600> you

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
eastern sound so let me let me show you

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:21.789 
eastern sound so let me let me show you
an<00:04:14.780> example<00:04:14.870> of<00:04:15.350> that<00:04:15.560> little<00:04:15.950> lick<00:04:16.459> motif<00:04:20.799> and

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
an example of that little lick motif and

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:24.280 
an example of that little lick motif and
I'm<00:04:21.950> going<00:04:22.280> to<00:04:22.310> actually<00:04:22.910> Bend<00:04:23.600> and<00:04:23.900> note

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
I'm going to actually Bend and note

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.680 
I'm going to actually Bend and note
that's<00:04:24.560> not<00:04:24.800> in<00:04:24.980> the<00:04:25.100> scale<00:04:25.430> right<00:04:26.240> here<00:04:26.300> this

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
that's not in the scale right here this

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.890 
that's not in the scale right here this
G<00:04:26.930> sharp<00:04:27.260> and<00:04:27.530> bend<00:04:27.860> it<00:04:28.010> into<00:04:28.250> the<00:04:28.580> pitch<00:04:28.900> to

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
G sharp and bend it into the pitch to

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.680 
G sharp and bend it into the pitch to
the<00:04:30.080> root<00:04:30.320> and<00:04:30.710> that's<00:04:31.460> a<00:04:31.610> very<00:04:31.880> very<00:04:32.330> cool

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
the root and that's a very very cool

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.600 
the root and that's a very very cool
common<00:04:33.140> way<00:04:33.320> of<00:04:34.930> bringing<00:04:35.930> the<00:04:36.220> flavor<00:04:37.220> of<00:04:37.370> the

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
common way of bringing the flavor of the

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:45.909 
common way of bringing the flavor of the
scale<00:04:37.940> out<00:04:38.150> check<00:04:38.420> this<00:04:38.540> out

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:48.670 

it's<00:04:46.789> got<00:04:46.909> a<00:04:46.939> cooler<00:04:47.210> Marty<00:04:47.629> Friedman<00:04:48.110> type<00:04:48.499> of

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
it's got a cooler Marty Friedman type of

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:54.879 
it's got a cooler Marty Friedman type of
sound

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:54.889 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:05:00.309 

yeah<00:04:57.520> okay<00:04:58.520> here<00:04:58.849> we<00:04:58.969> have<00:04:58.999> a<00:04:59.449> third<00:04:59.780> scale

00:05:00.309 --> 00:05:00.319 
yeah okay here we have a third scale

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:03.279 
yeah okay here we have a third scale
this<00:05:00.770> one<00:05:00.979> is<00:05:01.129> called<00:05:01.370> Arabian<00:05:02.180> major<00:05:02.659> so<00:05:03.259> we

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:03.289 
this one is called Arabian major so we

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:05.619 
this one is called Arabian major so we
out<00:05:03.620> of<00:05:03.800> the<00:05:03.919> Japanese<00:05:04.129> area<00:05:04.879> we're<00:05:05.060> back<00:05:05.210> into

00:05:05.619 --> 00:05:05.629 
out of the Japanese area we're back into

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:10.890 
out of the Japanese area we're back into
a<00:05:06.909> Arabic<00:05:07.909> type<00:05:08.210> of<00:05:08.479> a<00:05:08.629> cool<00:05:09.110> cool<00:05:09.469> sound<00:05:09.860> and

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
a Arabic type of a cool cool sound and

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.330 
a Arabic type of a cool cool sound and
check<00:05:11.900> the<00:05:12.020> scale<00:05:12.289> out<00:05:12.349> that's<00:05:12.949> a<00:05:13.069> really

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
check the scale out that's a really

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:35.000 
check the scale out that's a really
interesting<00:05:13.370> fingering<00:05:14.270> here<00:05:14.599> we<00:05:14.689> go

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:38.190 

definitely<00:05:36.010> sounds<00:05:36.430> like<00:05:36.460> a<00:05:36.840> like<00:05:37.840> a<00:05:37.870> cool

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:38.200 
definitely sounds like a like a cool

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.380 
definitely sounds like a like a cool
thing<00:05:38.230> especially<00:05:38.650> I<00:05:39.040> love<00:05:39.670> the<00:05:39.820> part<00:05:40.090> of<00:05:40.270> this

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:40.390 
thing especially I love the part of this

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.240 
thing especially I love the part of this
scale<00:05:40.690> that<00:05:40.720> actually<00:05:41.260> has<00:05:41.440> the<00:05:41.740> three

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.250 
scale that actually has the three

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:50.760 
scale that actually has the three
chromatic<00:05:42.760> notes<00:05:43.000> here

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.490 

is<00:05:51.520> definitely<00:05:51.910> missing<00:05:52.240> that<00:05:52.389> openness<00:05:52.990> of<00:05:53.259> a

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:53.500 
is definitely missing that openness of a

00:05:53.500 --> 00:06:07.840 
is definitely missing that openness of a
Japanese<00:05:54.009> scale<00:05:54.310> check<00:05:54.639> this<00:05:54.759> out

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:07.850 

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:12.760 

and<00:06:08.030> again<00:06:08.540> I<00:06:08.570> suggested<00:06:09.940> flatting<00:06:11.470> like<00:06:12.470> the

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:12.770 
and again I suggested flatting like the

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:14.439 
and again I suggested flatting like the
root<00:06:12.949> note<00:06:13.190> and<00:06:13.370> basically<00:06:13.699> bringing<00:06:14.060> it<00:06:14.300> up

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:14.449 
root note and basically bringing it up

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:18.430 
root note and basically bringing it up
to<00:06:14.660> two<00:06:15.110> pitch<00:06:16.240> okay<00:06:17.240> so<00:06:17.300> the<00:06:17.540> intervals<00:06:18.169> of

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:18.440 
to two pitch okay so the intervals of

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.590 
to two pitch okay so the intervals of
the<00:06:18.470> scale<00:06:18.949> as<00:06:19.250> compared<00:06:19.820> to<00:06:20.030> a<00:06:20.060> relative

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:20.600 
the scale as compared to a relative

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:28.719 
the scale as compared to a relative
major<00:06:20.930> scale<00:06:21.500> is<00:06:21.860> 1<00:06:22.750> flat<00:06:23.750> 2<00:06:24.400> 3<00:06:25.449> 4<00:06:26.449> 5<00:06:27.280> flat<00:06:28.280> 6

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:28.729 
major scale is 1 flat 2 3 4 5 flat 6

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:33.969 
major scale is 1 flat 2 3 4 5 flat 6
natural<00:06:29.510> 7<00:06:30.350> so<00:06:31.070> as<00:06:31.250> you<00:06:31.460> can<00:06:32.080> by<00:06:33.080> now<00:06:33.290> know<00:06:33.650> that

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:33.979 
natural 7 so as you can by now know that

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:36.280 
natural 7 so as you can by now know that
this<00:06:34.310> is<00:06:34.490> a<00:06:34.520> major<00:06:35.090> type<00:06:35.479> of<00:06:35.660> scale<00:06:35.930> because

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:36.290 
this is a major type of scale because

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:39.400 
this is a major type of scale because
the<00:06:36.440> third<00:06:36.710> is<00:06:36.889> a<00:06:36.919> natural<00:06:38.080> however<00:06:39.080> with<00:06:39.380> that

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:39.410 
the third is a natural however with that

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:41.650 
the third is a natural however with that
said<00:06:39.590> you<00:06:39.889> can't<00:06:40.340> play<00:06:40.520> a<00:06:40.580> minor<00:06:40.970> chord<00:06:41.360> and

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:41.660 
said you can't play a minor chord and

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:44.080 
said you can't play a minor chord and
still<00:06:42.199> get<00:06:42.410> away<00:06:42.440> with<00:06:42.889> using<00:06:43.100> the<00:06:43.430> scale<00:06:43.729> of<00:06:43.970> a

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:44.090 
still get away with using the scale of a

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:46.420 
still get away with using the scale of a
minor<00:06:44.360> chord<00:06:44.690> just<00:06:45.380> be<00:06:45.560> careful<00:06:45.979> of<00:06:46.130> how<00:06:46.280> these

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:46.430 
minor chord just be careful of how these

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:48.700 
minor chord just be careful of how these
intervals<00:06:46.940> work<00:06:47.180> but<00:06:47.750> you<00:06:47.840> can't<00:06:48.110> use<00:06:48.320> it<00:06:48.500> in<00:06:48.620> a

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:48.710 
intervals work but you can't use it in a
