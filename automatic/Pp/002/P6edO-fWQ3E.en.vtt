 move it closer to the public 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:57.699
 you had to do a lot of relationship work. which are often made for 

00:03:57.699 --> 00:04:01.319
 meetings after the shows that are useful for that sometimes blank 

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:07.059
 the public can better understand that world and then get passionate about it 

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:11.599

 he meant 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:24.639
 The informal meeting with people is very interesting, I think it is 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:27.559

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:33.110
 in a long way 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.240
 even less. show rooms because they also go see it 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.199
 show already meant to expect something that is already known as
