00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.650
 in paschal session 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.760
 now that many of us have 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.709
 enjoyed with the witcher 3 and 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.740
 we remember his previous chapter which 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:15.000
 The title of assassins of kings was 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.430
 gameplay that you will see in this clip 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.270
 belongs to the enhanced version edition 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.460
 version adapted for xbox 360 despite 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.690
 to offer a pretty graphic quality 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.090
 minor compared to the version 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:29.820
 original pc the rest then it will be 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.619
 identical in experience the number of 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.989
 sales of this version without being so 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.090
 raised as I started did they see cd 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.760
 projekt network that the consoleros 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.710
 they announced that product and who knows 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.780
 maybe that led to the third 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.239
 delivery will also come to the new 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.370
 generation of consoles history 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.260
 He started with a geralt of captive rivia 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.789
 marked by its past 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.370
 the story was built based on their 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.719
 memories this second chapter served 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.510
 as an approach to what has come 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.249
 be the trilogy one of the points that 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.049
 linked the first two games were 

00:00:59.249 --> 00:01:02.909
 the search for the king's killer fails 

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:05.400
 text although he will be the one accused of 

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:07.260
 betrayal and taken for guilty soon we 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.380
 we embark on the search for the murderer 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.850
 real this plot was taking much greater 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.159
 as we advanced weight 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.799
 thanks to the multitude of characters that 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.470
 gave form to this great adventure many 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.270
 of them new in this second episode 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.070
 you could see the logical evolution that the 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.110
 study had acquired after the first 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.450
 delivers a more dynamic game rhythm 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.280
 more areas to explore although bounded 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.289
 until we fulfilled certain missions 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.539
 to unlock new areas a 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:35.909
 richer and deeper story and narrated 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:38.280
 masterfully characters with more 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.830
 nuances and of course then more sex 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.899
 violence and magic the gameplay 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.460
 it got better thanks to a very 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.039
 intuitive that allowed us to change 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.229
 another sword quickly as well as 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:51.569
 use thrown objects and magic 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.240
 moment human enemies monsters 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:56.850
 trolls insects and other creatures were 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.770
 the white of our blood maybe 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.990
 some animations sinned abruptly 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.899
 but overall it was he showed agility 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.399
 and control in all its assets the 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.470
 history evolved according to our 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.569
 acts and decisions noting in everything 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.049
 moment that our entire environment was 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.690
 alive 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:14.670
 and what influence it let some 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.860
 Conversations were magisterial 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.720
 either by dialogue or by the 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.760
 facts to those that would take us 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.410
 was started where I appreciated the most 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.080
 dedication that the study put into the 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.400
 recreation of this magical world 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.560
 textures application game space 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.240
 ambience visual effects the 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.370
 hardware requirement I started was 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.140
 something high so at the time 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.300
 there were many who could not 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.730
 enjoy all the visual spectacle 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.040
 that I offered I started from there that version 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.680
 of xbox 360 hear it was a detail 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.140
 that we appreciate very many even today in 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.750
 day this game is considered as one 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.420
 of the best action rpg and its success 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.820
 helps the witcher 3 well outside 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.459
 expected even by players who never 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.860
 they had even heard of geralt from 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.660
 rivia is worth this script as small 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.700
 remember and tribute to this great 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.530
 classic and in the following sensation 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.530
 history we remember the conduit
