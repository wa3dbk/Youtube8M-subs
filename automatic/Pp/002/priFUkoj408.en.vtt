00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 Hey people, who do not know, I'm a dollar. 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:08.429
 The last video I made was that the 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.719
 green square she thinks and has no magic 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.429
 to give not for less not for now 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.450
 just need to update that list 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.750
 champions 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.740
 I put there I was very champion 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.539
 changed the ones that are stronger now 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.760
 some of them came out like ka sardines 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.640
 Then do not stay there for a few days. 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:27.750
 Today I'll show you the way 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.810
 I do to power over my link that the 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.880
 What do I do to be able to train after 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.620
 every game I write down where I went wrong 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:40.530
 Where did I get it? 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.940
 here is my notebook I leave here 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.010
 Can you see some things? 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:49.800
 annotated 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:52.260
 here also have all the game they play 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.949
 always honoring note the reason I 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.739
 I died 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.609
 or at least the bike what should I 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.199
 do not to have died or 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.940
 thing that needs to improve this type 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.119
 I transcribed everything I had written there 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.460
 To change into oge, it will get easier. 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.880
 show you there in my paper the note 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.320
 all of those who play the videos 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.119
 I want to play the support I 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.400
 I want to play today, want to play and like this. 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.530
 You're going to do that on me. 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.540
 I advise you to put of 54 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.430
 champions 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.040
 Are you going to do this? I advise you to 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.710
 put four to five champions 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:31.829
 because I think it's a good number to 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.650
 you lose to train and I always try 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.799
 to choose within that cease to be 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.770
 champions then so because of kelly key 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.150
 in tweet the steep virgins and by playing 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.070
 here choosing one of these five to 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.990
 I will not choose another one because 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.810
 The more you play with the champion, the more 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.950
 You learn about it, I know how to reduce it. 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.659
 amount of cards you will play 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.409
 you learn faster since these 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.570
 champions 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.540
 you better be good rather than 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.510
 you be kind of like in many and 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.340
 I put five champions from here and media 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.770
 not only put four because in 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.930
 certain streets that the game better and I 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.940
 I put in avoiding top side because it is 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.950
 my worst taking badly top then 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.810
 type avoids the same top player 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.910
 but if I have to play I would play with 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.130
 these I know that a didactic video 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.660
 so ax of the total that to be 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.760
 The faster I will not explain 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.280
 right for example I played I had 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.140
 a lot of votes but I threw away 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.550
 I do not know why but now I 'm going to do it. 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.300
 This is very effective. 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:33.020
 I played drug and a play that the 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.430
 team died had four players of 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.490
 four of his players in blue of them 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.840
 I was low life and I was not going to play there 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.160
 no zone and I was not tuned 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.080
 normal type work 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.820
 I played in the middle of the four I did not 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.160
 killed nobody, I died 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.470
 I noted that here, for example, not finding me 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.210
 God was mainly in the zone was 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.130
 made a lot of it with braga with the fans 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.459
 So I play a lot of people and do not fear. 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.500
 It's good to do that, huh? 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.000
 I played and played in the 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.650
 key rowing in the law n 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.360
 so I could not because it was too 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.400
 Damage because it 's gaining a lot of charm. 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.489
 so much that I could not help a 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.260
 large condominium you will start because 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.310
 training is not even when 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
 I was hit the key was not 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.670
 getting why to improve it iscte 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.700
 because I do not like part animation 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.380
 she thought it was horrible and then 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.489
 get used to being able to improve on my 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:25.019
 movie and make it worse I did not have 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.430
 only twice I found it popular and 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:29.880
 very unibanka so I think I should have 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.290
 stayed longer is able to play and I will 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.410
 I put it to take care and I called 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.810
 because I was a guy I 31 top and agent of 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:39.360
 book for example of the team that is good, right? 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:42.150
 he got 11 of the globe made there and complicated 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.320
 on the pricey side while trying to leave more 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.850
 two kilos because then I started to 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:49.230
 stay pretty lonely i just wanted 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:51.660
 here 6/2 in the game the beginning in it mm com 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.190
 the sister car just what to come back 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.570
 sooner but he does not win because 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.300
 I was leaving too late and 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:04:01.430
 ended up picking up what unites the tool or me 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:04.440
 was the paramount in the team with a face and a 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.880
 deforest since it guarantees it because the 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.340
 their flash is more important than my 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.250
 uncle the flash or it is not faster 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.170
 the guy is going to have to leave 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.700
 The type I'll have to leave behind 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.070
 them but it is more important to him 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.750
 spend flash because county closes 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.579
 much larger than that used in the 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.989
 health andrÃ© much better law stays in 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:22.989
 51 kg 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.000
 then the new air name and I found it 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.380
 that had to improve but some 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.030
 things that I had to learn better 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.340
 the yield of the charm for example of 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:34.340
 garden toward but was like 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.020
 arriving there playing very far I would go 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:40.100
 You better say you threw it at me. 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:42.050
 then I played tweed to die worth 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.000
 try to die - because I have a lot 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.070
 feather was killing too much size 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.450
 what to do but not why I think 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.630
 this item is very good for him but anyway 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:52.880
 It has nothing to do with one with received is 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.550
 just my opinion on the item and the 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.260
 synergy with the champion and neither here nor 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.060
 has on the other sheet some things about 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.500
 the legend he just finished having a 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.900
 thing in the championship 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.430
 today the hand played of several I found that 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.260
 A good pizade of his I think it worked 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.430
 very well in position 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.900
 I do not have it because I thought it was a 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.280
 hit with the time I think it stays 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.830
 very well a team of little 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:16.190
 if you do bild he did that is the 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:18.650
 ball between them to the east is 16 years ago in 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:22.100
 Portuguese finally is that of penetration and 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:24.440
 one who makes a fetus a peak there and 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.360
 will play without it because it depends a lot 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.190
 This is where you die when you die. 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:31.370
 there is a normal law for you to be able to give 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:34.160
 then say this, do not know what the field is 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.720
 very strong but in that championship he had 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.610
 that the problems against the home team 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.200
 It had to be very human and chop 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.330
 playing too much 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:44.540
 strong to defend because besides pulling 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:46.280
 easy and safe helm in the 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:48.530
 Tim fight is very strong and can give 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.820
 much damage in area only the only thing 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:52.250
 I thought he had to be careful. 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:54.500
 here it is you end up pulling too far 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:56.390
 wanting trying because your opponent 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.710
 So I put it to take care of him. 

00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:00.169
 You will be able to keep at home because it was 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:02.030
 crying a lot 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:04.040
 I have here with great breaking 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.960
 because we pull the air and I 

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.520
 quickly doing what you want with the 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.140
 fast actors too 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.660
 it has a high yield compared to 

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:13.580
 any other of which she was then 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:14.960
 because there can not very well clean 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.500
 It is so different that I did I not 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.140
 I have it 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:20.750
 so the report the discussion thread 

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:22.760
 very strong in the Mexican championship 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:24.620
 only they were much talked about now 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:28.220
 repeat and the championship pet is different 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:30.380
 the staff plays with the old pet and then 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:32.570
 I told you to take care of type for 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:34.100
 to be able to stay with them for now because 

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:36.200
 I know how strong they are. 

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:39.110
 need more analysis then I ran to 

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.700
 avoiding places and trash without words is 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:43.490
 best game support 

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:45.440
 so I just wanted to explain to you 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:46.520
 have a step in their power to train the note 

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.630
 all that i mistake 

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:50.450
 every time I play with the same 

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:51.470
 champion was the gay I take a look at the 

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:54.770
 that I went wrong because I was wrong to 

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:57.080
 new and I adopt the champions that I want 

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:58.640
 play because I think it's so strong and 

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.620
 Try not to leave since the more 

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:06.280
 play as they have nothing left you 

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:06.280
 will stay with him and then a little better
