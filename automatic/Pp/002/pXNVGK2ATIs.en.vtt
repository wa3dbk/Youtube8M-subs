00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
a few things that are new that are just

a few things that are new that are just
being<00:01:12.450> released<00:01:12.750> now<00:01:13.080> that<00:01:14.010> we<00:01:14.159> have<00:01:14.250> learned

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
being released now that we have learned

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.580 
being released now that we have learned
in<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:15.390> last<00:01:15.600> 48<00:01:16.020> hours<00:01:16.759> we<00:01:17.759> have<00:01:17.880> discovered

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
in the last 48 hours we have discovered

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.890 
in the last 48 hours we have discovered
that<00:01:19.590> we<00:01:19.920> are<00:01:19.950> already<00:01:20.280> detecting<00:01:21.090> nitrogen

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
that we are already detecting nitrogen

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.800 
that we are already detecting nitrogen
escaping<00:01:22.439> from<00:01:22.560> Pluto's<00:01:22.920> atmosphere<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.810> the

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
escaping from Pluto's atmosphere and the

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.330 
escaping from Pluto's atmosphere and the
important<00:01:25.290> part<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:25.650> that<00:01:25.799> is<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.220> was

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
important part of that is it was

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.249 
important part of that is it was
discovered<00:01:26.729> five<00:01:27.090> days<00:01:27.330> ago<00:01:27.509> much<00:01:27.900> farther

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
discovered five days ago much farther

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.300 
discovered five days ago much farther
from<00:01:28.650> Pluto<00:01:28.979> than<00:01:29.700> we<00:01:30.020> anticipated<00:01:31.070> this<00:01:32.070> may

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
from Pluto than we anticipated this may

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.069 
from Pluto than we anticipated this may
mean<00:01:32.460> that<00:01:32.520> Pluto's<00:01:32.970> escape<00:01:33.360> rate<00:01:33.570> is<00:01:33.810> higher

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
mean that Pluto's escape rate is higher

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.429 
mean that Pluto's escape rate is higher
than<00:01:34.950> models<00:01:35.400> had<00:01:35.549> shown<00:01:36.049> or<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.140> may<00:01:37.290> mean

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
than models had shown or it may mean

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:38.960 
than models had shown or it may mean
that<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.710> transport<00:01:38.280> mechanism<00:01:38.850> is

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
that the transport mechanism is

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.780 
that the transport mechanism is
different<00:01:39.180> than<00:01:39.509> what<00:01:39.659> we<00:01:39.780> anticipated<00:01:40.790> we've

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
different than what we anticipated we've

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.469 
different than what we anticipated we've
also<00:01:42.000> discovered<00:01:42.680> that<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:44.090> putative<00:01:45.090> polar

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
also discovered that the putative polar

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.950 
also discovered that the putative polar
cap<00:01:45.810> on<00:01:46.409> Pluto's<00:01:47.220> North<00:01:47.520> Pole<00:01:47.790> is<00:01:48.030> in<00:01:48.659> fact

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
cap on Pluto's North Pole is in fact

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.410 
cap on Pluto's North Pole is in fact
just<00:01:49.320> that<00:01:49.530> we<00:01:50.340> now<00:01:50.490> have<00:01:50.700> compositional

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
just that we now have compositional

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.530 
just that we now have compositional
spectroscopy<00:01:51.979> that<00:01:52.979> shows<00:01:53.220> methane<00:01:54.060> ice<00:01:54.240> and

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
spectroscopy that shows methane ice and

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.100 
spectroscopy that shows methane ice and
nitrogen<00:01:55.140> ice<00:01:55.259> there<00:01:56.090> so<00:01:57.090> we<00:01:57.299> now<00:01:57.420> fingerprint

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
nitrogen ice there so we now fingerprint

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.660 
nitrogen ice there so we now fingerprint
it<00:01:58.259> it<00:01:58.860> is<00:01:59.040> an<00:01:59.189> icy<00:01:59.520> polar<00:01:59.729> cap<00:02:00.060> after<00:02:01.020> all<00:02:01.170> our

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
it it is an icy polar cap after all our

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
and we've discovered that Pluto's a

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.220 
and we've discovered that Pluto's a
little<00:02:16.380> bit<00:02:16.500> larger<00:02:17.070> than<00:02:17.760> we<00:02:17.940> anticipated<00:02:18.540> we

little bit larger than we anticipated we

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
implications because it's larger and

a long time that means it's a little

a long time that means it's a little
less<00:02:40.770> dense<00:02:41.100> which<00:02:41.970> will<00:02:42.480> raise<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:43.560> fraction
