coverage<00:01:52.659> but<00:01:52.990> it<00:01:53.049> actually<00:01:53.320> blended<00:01:53.950> it

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:54.039 
coverage but it actually blended it

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:55.470 
coverage but it actually blended it
really<00:01:54.460> really<00:01:54.640> nicely

was<00:01:58.510> reading<00:01:58.840> the<00:01:58.960> reviews<00:01:59.380> and<00:01:59.650> I<00:02:00.160> thought

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
was reading the reviews and I thought

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.670 
was reading the reviews and I thought
light<00:02:00.670> would<00:02:00.880> be<00:02:01.090> too<00:02:01.360> light<00:02:01.570> for<00:02:01.630> me<00:02:01.870> but<00:02:02.650> a

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
light would be too light for me but a

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.140 
light would be too light for me but a
girl<00:02:03.190> that<00:02:03.550> said<00:02:03.790> she<00:02:03.970> was<00:02:04.120> first

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
girl that said she was first

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.590 
girl that said she was first
so<00:02:05.600> that<00:02:05.750> light<00:02:06.050> was<00:02:06.290> too<00:02:06.680> dark<00:02:06.920> for<00:02:07.070> her<00:02:07.430> so<00:02:08.180> I

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
so that light was too dark for her so I

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.460 
so that light was too dark for her so I
didn't<00:02:08.960> want<00:02:09.110> to<00:02:09.200> get<00:02:10.270> obviously<00:02:11.270> I'm<00:02:11.480> like

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
didn't want to get obviously I'm like

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.880 
didn't want to get obviously I'm like
seemed<00:02:12.800> like<00:02:13.010> the<00:02:13.160> better<00:02:13.280> option<00:02:13.490> because

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
seemed like the better option because

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.580 
seemed like the better option because
I<00:02:14.950> guess<00:02:15.550> medium<00:02:16.180> would<00:02:16.510> be<00:02:16.720> earth<00:02:17.050> there's

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
I guess medium would be earth there's

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.230 
I guess medium would be earth there's
only<00:02:17.710> three<00:02:18.040> shades<00:02:18.340> I<00:02:18.490> think<00:02:18.730> so<00:02:18.910> the<00:02:19.030> next

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
only three shades I think so the next

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.210 
only three shades I think so the next
one<00:02:19.390> would<00:02:19.600> be<00:02:19.660> for<00:02:20.020> like<00:02:20.140> darker<00:02:20.650> skin<00:02:20.920> tones

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
one would be for like darker skin tones

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.150 
one would be for like darker skin tones
in<00:02:21.490> mine<00:02:21.700> so<00:02:22.510> this<00:02:22.690> may<00:02:22.900> actually<00:02:22.959> worked<00:02:23.770> good

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
in mine so this may actually worked good

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.920 
in mine so this may actually worked good
with<00:02:24.370> my<00:02:24.520> skin<00:02:24.790> tone<00:02:24.819> it<00:02:25.180> wasn't<00:02:25.510> too<00:02:25.690> light

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
with my skin tone it wasn't too light

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.750 
with my skin tone it wasn't too light
and<00:02:26.080> it<00:02:26.200> wasn't<00:02:26.470> too<00:02:26.650> dark<00:02:26.860> so<00:02:26.980> really<00:02:27.490> really

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760
