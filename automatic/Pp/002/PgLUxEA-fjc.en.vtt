00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.230 

have<00:02:52.460> four<00:02:53.240> four<00:02:53.840> four<00:02:54.110> khm<00:02:54.800> eyes<00:02:55.030> on<00:02:56.030> the

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
have four four four khm eyes on the

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.030 
have four four four khm eyes on the
street<00:02:56.510> just<00:02:56.840> kind<00:02:57.020> of<00:02:57.050> nice<00:02:57.230> and<00:02:57.440> wide<00:02:57.560> lenses

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
street just kind of nice and wide lenses

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.920 
street just kind of nice and wide lenses
on<00:02:58.250> them<00:02:58.430> just<00:02:58.880> to<00:02:59.000> give<00:02:59.150> a<00:02:59.180> nice<00:02:59.360> good<00:02:59.660> fill

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
on them just to give a nice good fill

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.290 
on them just to give a nice good fill
and<00:03:00.170> then<00:03:00.230> hopefully<00:03:00.530> the<00:03:00.710> Sun<00:03:00.920> stays<00:03:01.220> I<00:03:01.640> think

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
and then hopefully the Sun stays I think

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.580 
and then hopefully the Sun stays I think
it<00:03:02.360> comes<00:03:02.540> going<00:03:02.720> to<00:03:02.780> end<00:03:02.900> up<00:03:03.020> being<00:03:03.170> behind<00:03:03.470> us

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
it comes going to end up being behind us

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.020 
it comes going to end up being behind us
so<00:03:03.710> the<00:03:03.770> Sun<00:03:03.920> works<00:03:04.070> as<00:03:04.220> a<00:03:04.250> backlight<00:03:04.730> and

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
so the Sun works as a backlight and

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.190 
so the Sun works as a backlight and
we're<00:03:05.210> just<00:03:05.330> kinda<00:03:05.540> like<00:03:05.630> filling<00:03:05.990> in<00:03:06.080> with

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
we're just kinda like filling in with

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.900 
we're just kinda like filling in with
your<00:03:06.380> look<00:03:06.560> the<00:03:06.590> lights<00:03:06.980> will<00:03:07.250> fill<00:03:07.580> them<00:03:07.730> in

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
your look the lights will fill them in

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.930 
your look the lights will fill them in
and<00:03:08.350> let<00:03:09.350> them<00:03:09.470> pop<00:03:09.740> from<00:03:10.070> everything<00:03:10.400> else<00:03:10.550> so

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
and let them pop from everything else so

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.520 
and let them pop from everything else so
