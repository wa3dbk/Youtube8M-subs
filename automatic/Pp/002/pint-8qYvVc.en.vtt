I'm<00:03:48.900> nuzzling<00:03:49.380> her<00:03:49.650> she's<00:03:50.370> already<00:03:50.819> when<00:03:51.060> she

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:51.389 
I'm nuzzling her she's already when she

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:52.520 
I'm nuzzling her she's already when she
wants<00:03:51.840> to<00:03:51.989> give<00:03:52.169> her

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
wants to give her

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.530 
wants to give her
right<00:03:52.770> now<00:03:52.980> partly<00:03:53.700> because<00:03:53.790> when<00:03:54.180> she<00:03:54.209> does

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
right now partly because when she does

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.140 
right now partly because when she does
Street<00:03:55.200> the<00:03:55.319> oxytocin<00:03:56.130> and<00:03:56.310> the<00:03:56.700> other<00:03:56.880> starts

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
Street the oxytocin and the other starts

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.090 
Street the oxytocin and the other starts
to<00:03:57.390> fill<00:03:57.600> up<00:03:57.630> we<00:03:58.410> are<00:03:58.500> going<00:03:58.709> to<00:03:58.770> give<00:03:58.920> her

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
to fill up we are going to give her

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.250 
to fill up we are going to give her
brain<00:03:59.400> so<00:03:59.819> it's<00:04:00.030> worth<00:04:00.209> it's<00:04:00.480> just<00:04:00.720> another

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
brain so it's worth it's just another

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.140 
brain so it's worth it's just another
form<00:04:01.530> of<00:04:01.620> operant<00:04:02.100> conditioning<00:04:02.160> or<00:04:02.760> animal

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
form of operant conditioning or animal

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.090 
form of operant conditioning or animal
training<00:04:03.450> she<00:04:04.200> knows<00:04:04.410> that<00:04:04.709> it's<00:04:04.980> a

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
training she knows that it's a

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.610 
training she knows that it's a
reportable<00:04:05.690> experience<00:04:06.690> so<00:04:07.170> she's<00:04:07.380> going<00:04:07.530> to

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
reportable experience so she's going to

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.860 
reportable experience so she's going to
work<00:04:07.770> real<00:04:07.980> hard<00:04:08.040> to<00:04:08.280> do<00:04:08.430> it<00:04:08.610> but<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:09.150> baby<00:04:09.390> of

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
work real hard to do it but the baby of

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.720 
work real hard to do it but the baby of
stimulating<00:04:10.770> is<00:04:10.860> really<00:04:11.100> much<00:04:11.280> seals<00:04:11.520> our

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
stimulating is really much seals our

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.280 
stimulating is really much seals our
deal<00:04:11.880> if<00:04:12.090> you<00:04:12.270> just<00:04:12.420> get<00:04:12.630> in<00:04:12.720> there<00:04:12.870> to<00:04:12.989> do<00:04:13.080> that

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
deal if you just get in there to do that

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.650 
deal if you just get in there to do that
then<00:04:13.590> she<00:04:13.920> won't<00:04:14.370> be<00:04:14.520> able<00:04:14.550> to<00:04:15.000> it<00:04:15.120> just<00:04:15.300> isn't

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
then she won't be able to it just isn't

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.409 
then she won't be able to it just isn't
it<00:04:15.950> it<00:04:16.950> just<00:04:17.250> doesn't<00:04:17.400> charge<00:04:17.790> her<00:04:18.090> the<00:04:18.239> way<00:04:18.389> he

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
it it just doesn't charge her the way he

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.270 
it it just doesn't charge her the way he
does<00:04:18.870> just<00:04:18.900> the<00:04:19.290> idea<00:04:19.470> of<00:04:19.680> getting<00:04:19.829> a<00:04:20.010> treat

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
does just the idea of getting a treat

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.580 
does just the idea of getting a treat
isn't<00:04:20.579> enough<00:04:20.820> so<00:04:21.419> what<00:04:21.570> gills<00:04:21.780> watching<00:04:22.320> for

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
isn't enough so what gills watching for

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.830 
isn't enough so what gills watching for
is<00:04:22.889> she's<00:04:23.370> going<00:04:23.580> from<00:04:23.940> one<00:04:24.150> key<00:04:24.389> to<00:04:24.419> the<00:04:24.690> other

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
is she's going from one key to the other

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.810 
is she's going from one key to the other
and<00:04:25.169> as<00:04:25.560> long<00:04:25.710> it<00:04:25.919> looks<00:04:26.130> like<00:04:26.310> he's<00:04:26.460> drinking

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
and as long it looks like he's drinking

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.880 
and as long it looks like he's drinking
right<00:04:26.970> now<00:04:27.000> but<00:04:27.300> he's<00:04:27.390> not<00:04:27.570> as<00:04:28.050> long<00:04:28.590> as<00:04:28.770> he

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
right now but he's not as long as he

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.159 
right now but he's not as long as he
keeps<00:04:29.100> moving<00:04:29.400> one<00:04:29.850> T<00:04:30.150> to<00:04:30.330> the<00:04:30.390> other<00:04:30.600> that

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
keeps moving one T to the other that

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:33.560 
keeps moving one T to the other that
means<00:04:31.380> there's<00:04:31.590> no<00:04:31.800> flow<00:04:32.160> so<00:04:32.970> look<00:04:33.390> at<00:04:33.510> how

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
means there's no flow so look at how

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.420 
means there's no flow so look at how
client<00:04:33.990> she's<00:04:34.140> got<00:04:34.350> stuff<00:04:34.650> still<00:04:35.010> she<00:04:35.280> is

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
client she's got stuff still she is

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.880 
client she's got stuff still she is
that's<00:04:36.390> one<00:04:36.750> of<00:04:36.840> the<00:04:36.930> indicators<00:04:37.169> that<00:04:37.500> she's

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
that's one of the indicators that she's

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.130 
that's one of the indicators that she's
probably<00:04:38.160> dropping<00:04:38.610> her<00:04:38.850> milk<00:04:39.090> and<00:04:39.750> now<00:04:39.930> she's

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
probably dropping her milk and now she's

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.560 
probably dropping her milk and now she's
looking<00:04:40.440> back<00:04:40.560> at<00:04:40.620> gill<00:04:41.010> so<00:04:41.550> that<00:04:41.730> says<00:04:42.000> she

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
looking back at gill so that says she

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.480 
looking back at gill so that says she
excreted<00:04:43.050> her<00:04:43.110> oxytocin<00:04:43.860> she's<00:04:44.040> chewing<00:04:44.280> her

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
excreted her oxytocin she's chewing her

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.190 
excreted her oxytocin she's chewing her
cud<00:04:44.520> again<00:04:44.970> now<00:04:45.450> we're<00:04:45.630> just<00:04:45.660> waiting<00:04:45.870> for<00:04:46.110> the

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
cud again now we're just waiting for the

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.420 
cud again now we're just waiting for the

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
opposite toasted to get all the way

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.010 
opposite toasted to get all the way
through<00:04:47.610> the<00:04:47.700> bloodstream<00:04:47.940> so<00:04:48.840> do<00:04:48.900> you<00:04:48.990> think

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
through the bloodstream so do you think

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.480 
through the bloodstream so do you think
we<00:04:49.169> can<00:04:49.350> give<00:04:49.500> her<00:04:49.560> her<00:04:49.680> brain<00:04:49.890> now<00:04:50.100> yeah<00:04:50.460> I

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
we can give her her brain now yeah I

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.040 
we can give her her brain now yeah I
think<00:04:50.610> it's<00:04:50.820> pretty<00:04:50.970> good<00:04:51.090> right<00:04:51.240> now<00:04:51.570> she's
