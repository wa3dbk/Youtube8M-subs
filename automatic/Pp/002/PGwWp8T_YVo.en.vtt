00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
route which is the preferred option as

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.000 
route which is the preferred option as
you<00:02:14.360> guys<00:02:14.600> can<00:02:14.840> see<00:02:15.020> here<00:02:15.260> just<00:02:15.290> before<00:02:15.920> it

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
you guys can see here just before it

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.470 
you guys can see here just before it
gets<00:02:16.190> to<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.460> trailer<00:02:16.700> park<00:02:16.790> we<00:02:17.180> managed<00:02:17.420> to

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
gets to the trailer park we managed to

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.720 
gets to the trailer park we managed to
find<00:02:17.840> it<00:02:18.020> I'd<00:02:18.380> also<00:02:18.620> suggest<00:02:18.950> only<00:02:19.430> letting

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
find it I'd also suggest only letting

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.030 
find it I'd also suggest only letting
one<00:02:20.060> person<00:02:20.510> in<00:02:20.600> the<00:02:20.690> car<00:02:20.900> shoot<00:02:21.320> at<00:02:21.530> the<00:02:21.710> RV

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
one person in the car shoot at the RV

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.650 
one person in the car shoot at the RV
because<00:02:22.250> if<00:02:22.490> you<00:02:22.610> all<00:02:22.760> spray<00:02:23.180> at<00:02:23.360> the<00:02:23.420> same

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
because if you all spray at the same

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.450 
because if you all spray at the same
time<00:02:23.900> it's<00:02:24.170> more<00:02:24.410> than<00:02:24.530> likely<00:02:24.740> gonna<00:02:25.040> blow<00:02:25.310> it

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
time it's more than likely gonna blow it

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.640 
time it's more than likely gonna blow it
up<00:02:25.550> and<00:02:25.670> just<00:02:25.850> fail<00:02:26.090> the<00:02:26.270> mission<00:02:26.390> so<00:02:27.140> what<00:02:27.560> you

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
up and just fail the mission so what you

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.650 
up and just fail the mission so what you
should<00:02:27.800> do<00:02:27.980> is<00:02:28.100> get<00:02:28.220> the<00:02:28.370> host<00:02:28.670> who's<00:02:29.180> hosting

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
should do is get the host who's hosting

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.240 
should do is get the host who's hosting
the<00:02:29.990> mission<00:02:30.230> to<00:02:30.440> actually<00:02:30.680> shoot<00:02:30.890> the<00:02:30.950> driver

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
the mission to actually shoot the driver

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.949 
the mission to actually shoot the driver
it's<00:02:31.610> most<00:02:31.880> likely<00:02:31.970> he'll<00:02:32.450> have<00:02:32.630> the<00:02:32.750> best

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
it's most likely he'll have the best

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:34.960 
it's most likely he'll have the best
connection<00:02:33.440> so<00:02:33.920> just<00:02:33.950> take<00:02:34.459> your<00:02:34.490> time<00:02:34.670> with

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
connection so just take your time with

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
this just make sure you get a perfect

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.170 
this just make sure you get a perfect
headshot<00:02:36.800> on<00:02:36.830> the<00:02:37.010> driver<00:02:37.280> and<00:02:37.640> then<00:02:37.730> simply

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
headshot on the driver and then simply

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.150 
headshot on the driver and then simply
get<00:02:38.360> out<00:02:38.390> and<00:02:38.780> get<00:02:39.020> inside<00:02:39.320> the<00:02:39.500> RV<00:02:39.800> once<00:02:40.070> you
