 yes 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.070

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.890
 and 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.080
 and that has been the bad end of the resident 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:28.360
 evil revelations to all in which 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.310
 they destroy now on all sides 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.010

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:37.900
 the record company ends up becoming a 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:40.419
 monster 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.639
 there's nothing left the poor man does not 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:43.960
 is absolutely nothing I say no 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:45.669
 I finish understanding is because the girl is 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.190
 so happy if you have the memories of 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:50.710
 álex will know what laboratory grandfather 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:53.139
 no reason has lost all 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.000
 resources and is a girl of eight years in 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:57.380
 an island full of monsters in which 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.140
 can not control 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:02.210
 since they do not have the normal parasite that 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:03.890
 let's know and although I can control them 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.510
 going to do are not zombies can not 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:08.270
 build a boat to be the caa and 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:09.530
 try to build an empire of nothing anymore 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.570
 that the bright idea of ​​flying your 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:15.470
 laboratory because he wanted to leave it 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:17.990
 without any recourse and his father died like this 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:20.030
 that does not have resources out there either 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:22.250
 that its end is not very funny is a 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:24.670
 8 year old girl on an island full of 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.670
 monsters 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:30.550
 and can not leave the island 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:34.169
 and although ours do not attack her 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.169
 I can do anything with them 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:49.690
 good 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:52.259
 and little more than saying that is the end 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:55.259
 bad of the civil resident as mentioned 

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:55.259
 interesting 

00:05:55.569 --> 00:06:03.159
 the truth is that yes because I had the 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:05.349
 first the good ending to the end 

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:08.110
 good as well as bad in the 

00:06:05.349 --> 00:06:11.080
 decision that decides what you do 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:12.789
 with a thousand if in the fight in a thousand what 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.979
 finish off having finished with him later 

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:17.289
 in the quick time event after the elevator 

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:19.629
 the auctions with claire will be the 

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:21.969
 final bad and the shots with moira that 

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:23.529
 makes alone let's say forces for 

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:25.029
 survive when two thousand stones arrive 

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:26.919
 over and their legs are busting 

00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:29.870
 you can survive that purely 

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:31.700
 Will and 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:35.500
 saves the situation in the last 

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:35.500
 moment on this side 

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:41.690
 that's how you shoot it well 

00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:46.440
 and good 

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:48.540
 I think nothing more to say 

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:50.040
 and so from what it is like then I was 

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:51.990
 is leaving something to tell me if I had 

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.010
 I take out the bad end of first service 

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:55.140
 It has been very interesting because I had 

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:59.630
 I have been saying they have destroyed a mobile 

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:59.630
 and this ends cities wow 

00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:06.580
 someone got up wanting 

00:07:02.959 --> 00:07:06.580
 annoy when he described at the end 

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:11.520
 the good ending is quite better 

00:07:09.479 --> 00:07:12.870
 truth and nothing else 

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:16.729
 thanks for watching the video I hope that you 

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:16.729
 has been entertaining and until next time
