usually I buy things that I know would
work<00:04:59.370> for<00:04:59.580> me<00:04:59.729> but<00:04:59.990> when<00:05:00.990> I<00:05:01.050> wasn't<00:05:01.349> enough<00:05:01.650> I

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
work for me but when I wasn't enough I

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.020 
work for me but when I wasn't enough I
saw<00:05:01.979> everything<00:05:02.430> it's<00:05:02.639> really<00:05:02.669> inexpensive

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
saw everything it's really inexpensive

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.900

and<00:05:03.930> I<00:05:04.830> was<00:05:04.979> just<00:05:05.130> trying<00:05:05.400> for<00:05:05.639> things<00:05:05.820> I

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
and I was just trying for things I

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.210 
and I was just trying for things I

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
haven't tried out before first I thought

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.339

they look really cool and you wear high
heels<00:05:20.699> and<00:05:21.030> I<00:05:22.520> mean<00:05:23.570> it's<00:05:24.570> not<00:05:24.690> it's<00:05:25.050> not

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:25.229 
heels and I mean it's not it's not

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:27.170 
heels and I mean it's not it's not
expensive<00:05:25.620> enough<00:05:25.830> so<00:05:26.250> I<00:05:26.340> also<00:05:26.580> try<00:05:26.909> all<00:05:27.060> these

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:25.110 
you I would like how sleek it looks and
the<00:06:23.470> chilliest<00:06:24.130> quite<00:06:24.340> nice<00:06:24.520> as<00:06:24.639> well<00:06:24.790> as<00:06:24.940> well

the chilliest quite nice as well as well
as<00:06:25.240> more<00:06:26.050> expensive<00:06:26.560> than<00:06:26.710> the<00:06:26.860> other<00:06:27.010> banks<00:06:27.490> I

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:27.669 
as more expensive than the other banks I

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:30.210 
as more expensive than the other banks I
remember<00:06:28.240> how<00:06:28.300> much<00:06:28.510> maybe<00:06:29.320> like<00:06:29.530> eight<00:06:29.770> zeros

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:30.220 
remember how much maybe like eight zeros

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.700 
remember how much maybe like eight zeros
but<00:06:30.669> I<00:06:31.030> think<00:06:31.600> it's<00:06:31.720> worth<00:06:31.840> the<00:06:31.870> price<00:06:32.110> and<00:06:32.500> I

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:32.710 
but I think it's worth the price and I

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:35.010 
but I think it's worth the price and I
would<00:06:32.889> like<00:06:33.040> it<00:06:33.250> I<00:06:33.490> was<00:06:34.030> about<00:06:34.240> these<00:06:34.449> two<00:06:34.510> snap
