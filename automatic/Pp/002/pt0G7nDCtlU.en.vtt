00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 hello swami det this is a review of mods and 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.720
 Today we have a mod that adds to 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:09.120
 game new needles for the table you so here 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.710
 we can switch from modified 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.349
 and usually flour and 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.750
 so much yesterday vanya and modified 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:20.369
 gu can use them to take our sword 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.779
 this mod is called intent plus when we 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.820
 always reduce any subject he 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.130
 reflected here we can charm it 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.680
 for any enchantment we want here 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.019
 on the limits of the possible this mod cleans 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.059
 rationality is frustrating and allows 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.370
 to charm the way we want to eat 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.170
 enchantment are combined then they 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.180
 covered in green and if for 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.340
 there are not enough levels or just 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.710
 missing a few bookshelves then they 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.820
 become covered in red now disappoint on 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.129
 ball -5 and for example to return 2 somewhere 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.680
 we will need level 25 and click enchant 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:57.420
 and and we will get less who wanted 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:00.059
 and now I will leave the creative with 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.010
 enchant 2 sword for anything but how 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.960
 see everything is covered in red when we 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.200
 want to enchant for anything because 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.140
 we are not enough levels that we 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.240
 will be very successful will be bookshelves 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.670
 that fix the item and earlier it can 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.610
 it was done in the very old people either 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.869
 just transfer enchantment with it either 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.460
 same simply remove enchantment from it 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:27.420
 need to enter the anvil menu 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.700
 now it's done for balance here 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.710
 how do you know what to fix our diamond 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.200
 the sword we need to take more and diamond 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.380
 spend 15 levels where fixes 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.909
 transfer enchantment we have nothing to 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.430
 it cannot be done because it 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.710
 impossible and it's done for balance on 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:48.200
 all 147 we are with these crosses 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:50.670
 faster on seasons 2 and enjoyed here 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.549
 also remove enchantment from the subject 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.799
 also impossible but what a good mod 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.149
 was cheat true 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:59.159
 this all follows the attention of 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.020
 view signed feed put likes 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.479
 the author once thought to do so 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.610
 so that we spend all sorts of nuggets and 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.640
 Gast tears to repair and abuse and 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.700
 enchantments of items as well 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.410
 transference in a charming other but 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.300
 no good has affected so 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.910
 This garbage removed and now some 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.290
 stupid stemping and we see here 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.180
