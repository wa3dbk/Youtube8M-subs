00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:51.640
 stretched his opponent he prepared he 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:55.600
 hid the most important best strike 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:59.950

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.310
 was 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.110
 and it was a principle already the end I really 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.750
 I think there can be no doubt 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.149

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.550

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.080
 since i was in training camp 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:18.230
 alexander and syria vatamanyuk and 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.960
 james ali bashir we have always turned out 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:24.520
 it is in training the strongest blow 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:27.590
 strongest hand 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:30.560
 home-made us well here 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.300
 Alexander said that Alexander Mustache for 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.040
 lately I have grown very much 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.440
 asked about this from vitali klitschko he 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.180
 also this is noted here in your opinion in 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:42.710
 what exactly he grew what components 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:45.020
 Books will be seen that matured and there is 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:47.420
 his training process and passed 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:51.250
 sparring in the most brutal 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:55.130
 say and in working out and there was and cutting 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:57.470
 salam man he will do the wind but here 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.780
 Alexander Mustache said that he and his 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.120
 the team were preparing for a longer 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.540
 distances in this fight and you were on 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.850
 fees 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.530
 you can tell if you were ready 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.050
 alexander box a loser 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.750
 always the training process is put on 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:14.980
 full distance and senior worked 12 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:18.440
 Rounds and practiced sparring for 15 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:21.040
 rival bedrooms they changed and everything 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.200
 fresh fresher and Sasha fought and fought 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.970
 ready for all distances that we can 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.320
 say about rival alexander today then 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.660
 have we done some kind of advance to him and 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:32.239
 betrayed and in fact it turned out 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.250
 it's just a mustache was still not living 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.290
 now here is still a long time the person was first 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.840
 exactly as we expected 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.620
 here the mustache was even better than he was 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.450
 previous battle that's all and he him 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.459
 He broke down in the first round with the one 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.280
 I did not know that he broke off but he already 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:52.250
 that's how it is but the influx when missed 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:55.129
 Now these powerful blows here somehow it does not 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:58.430
 really understood that I understood yes I understood everything yes he 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:04:01.069
 honestly worked here he am he sincerely 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:03.950
 wanted to continue the fight to the due 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:06.739
 yes no yes well done but he did all that 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:10.069
 I could just have a mustache 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:13.579
 better if he is so from a fight in a battle like this 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:18.349
 such jumps will do well so there 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:21.320
 the sky is not the limit for him and now is low 

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:23.870
 questions to you and how do you debut today 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.009
 have you all done what you planned 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:29.080
 I have not boxed for a long time 

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:31.550
 moon carcass medals moments did not work 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:34.669
 scattered on unnecessary things by 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:37.580
 parties listened to publish the detail swam 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:39.880
 but then somehow everything worked out many 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.130
 points are not turned during the 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.900
 but I already understood that I am not cutting him 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.720
 I miss with myself 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.880
 work and everything is ahead many 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.650
 experts noted that the opponent 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.110
 you picked up for the first fight to debut 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.090
 very serious let's say so experienced 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.280
 twenty eight fights you deliberately 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.170
 went for it after all was a bodybuilder not 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.630
 I say I do not deal with this issue 

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:04.690
 and my job to train and you can 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:08.170
 say go work opponent not 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:10.180
 simple experienced very well competently 

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:12.250
 treated before weighing in 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.890
 weighting and could say during the battle 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:20.400
 apologized wanted to continue our canoe 

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:23.680
 you as the referee said time is a broken nose 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:26.320
 it's cold now how do you see your 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:29.350
 future in pro boxing but coming 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:32.380
 in advance we will not throw 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:35.080
 say far look in near 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:37.120
 I would also like to speak in the future 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.670
 six rounds you have this demo yet 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.950
 go the full distance as in 

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:45.850
 round four already realized that when 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:49.840
 it is gone too far 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:52.360
 I want to say more to do better 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.380
 combinations than i did thank you denis we 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.020
 wish you good luck 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.670
 when to wait for a championship fight involving 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.710
 alexira mustache and why vladimir 

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:01.480
 Klitschko must fear Taison Fury 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:04.860
 talk about all this after 

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.860
 short commercial break
