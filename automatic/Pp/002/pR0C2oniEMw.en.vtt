I can prune this back and it will

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.910 
I can prune this back and it will
recover<00:00:53.340> quickly<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.050> refo<00:00:55.050> liate<00:00:55.350> itself

and<00:02:18.370> pull<00:02:18.670> them<00:02:18.880> away<00:02:19.060> from<00:02:19.209> the<00:02:19.630> wall<00:02:19.870> so<00:02:20.530> that

and pull them away from the wall so that

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.690 
and pull them away from the wall so that
I<00:02:20.770> don't<00:02:21.040> have<00:02:21.280> to<00:02:21.459> handle<00:02:21.819> them<00:02:23.250> this<00:02:24.250> tool<00:02:24.550> is

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
I don't have to handle them this tool is

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.390 
I don't have to handle them this tool is
particularly<00:02:25.180> handy<00:02:25.959> during<00:02:26.470> the<00:02:26.890> rest<00:02:27.160> of

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
particularly handy during the rest of

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.010 
particularly handy during the rest of
the<00:02:27.520> year<00:02:27.760> when<00:02:27.970> you're<00:02:28.120> deadheading<00:02:28.810> this

the year when you're deadheading this

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.400 
the year when you're deadheading this
same<00:02:29.350> plant<00:02:29.830> and<00:02:30.190> you're<00:02:30.970> you're<00:02:31.780> trying<00:02:32.200> to

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
same plant and you're you're trying to

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.860 
same plant and you're you're trying to
reach<00:02:32.620> some<00:02:32.950> of<00:02:33.069> the<00:02:33.160> higher<00:02:33.400> branches<00:02:33.880> and<00:02:34.480> it

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
reach some of the higher branches and it

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.260 
reach some of the higher branches and it
allows<00:02:35.140> you<00:02:35.380> to<00:02:35.530> reach<00:02:35.739> up<00:02:35.770> there<00:02:36.280> cut<00:02:37.060> them

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
allows you to reach up there cut them

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.720 
allows you to reach up there cut them
off<00:02:37.540> and<00:02:37.840> pull<00:02:38.410> them<00:02:38.620> out<00:02:38.830> of<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.190> plant

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
off and pull them out of the plant

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.390 
off and pull them out of the plant
without<00:02:40.630> ever<00:02:40.870> having<00:02:41.200> to<00:02:41.440> get<00:02:41.709> close<00:02:42.010> to<00:02:42.250> the

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
plant you can see now that I finished

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.960 
plant you can see now that I finished
pruning<00:02:47.230> this<00:02:47.440> that<00:02:47.769> a<00:02:47.800> lot<00:02:48.100> of<00:02:48.280> the<00:02:48.430> older

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
pruning this that a lot of the older

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.410 
pruning this that a lot of the older
branches<00:02:49.600> that<00:02:49.810> were<00:02:50.019> the<00:02:50.980> original<00:02:51.640> strong

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
branches that were the original strong

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.110 
branches that were the original strong
branches<00:02:53.050> that<00:02:53.320> I<00:02:53.350> trained<00:02:53.950> are<00:02:54.310> pulled<00:02:54.820> to

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
branches that I trained are pulled to

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.360 
branches that I trained are pulled to
the<00:02:55.269> side<00:02:55.570> and<00:02:55.989> you<00:02:56.410> can<00:02:56.440> see<00:02:56.620> how<00:02:57.070> other

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
the side and you can see how other

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.449 
the side and you can see how other
branches<00:02:57.970> radiate<00:02:58.540> upward<00:02:59.200> climbing<00:03:00.190> roses

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
branches radiate upward climbing roses

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.750

bloom<00:03:01.120> on<00:03:01.420> vertical<00:03:02.319> branches<00:03:02.980> so<00:03:03.250> you<00:03:03.310> want

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
bloom on vertical branches so you want

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.059 
bloom on vertical branches so you want
to<00:03:04.000> encourage<00:03:04.480> some<00:03:04.930> of<00:03:04.959> the<00:03:05.230> young<00:03:05.470> branches

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
to encourage some of the young branches

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:08.370 
to encourage some of the young branches
to<00:03:06.310> go<00:03:06.459> horizontal<00:03:07.330> so<00:03:07.780> that<00:03:07.810> when<00:03:08.200> they

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
to go horizontal so that when they

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.710 
to go horizontal so that when they
sprout<00:03:08.680> new<00:03:09.160> ones<00:03:09.430> they're<00:03:09.730> pointed<00:03:10.209> upwards

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
sprout new ones they're pointed upwards

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.420 
sprout new ones they're pointed upwards
and<00:03:10.989> those<00:03:11.140> will<00:03:11.319> produce<00:03:11.530> most<00:03:12.100> of<00:03:12.250> your

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
and those will produce most of your

and those will produce most of your
blooms<00:03:13.110> this<00:03:14.110> shows<00:03:14.500> how<00:03:14.830> the<00:03:14.860> Rose<00:03:15.819> woods<00:03:16.180> was
