options but with video we already know
that<00:00:48.690> these<00:00:48.960> cameras<00:00:49.350> do<00:00:49.500> horribly<00:00:49.950> when<00:00:50.100> it

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
love about the battery grip is not only

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.330 
love about the battery grip is not only
is<00:00:55.020> it<00:00:55.110> giving<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.590> little<00:00:55.829> more<00:00:55.920> weight<00:00:56.160> so

more<00:01:04.949> stability<00:01:05.309> as<00:01:05.580> opposed<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.030> just<00:01:06.270> the

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
more stability as opposed to just the

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.679 
more stability as opposed to just the
body<00:01:06.659> itself<00:01:07.520> you<00:01:08.520> will<00:01:08.700> have<00:01:09.090> more<00:01:09.360> power

battery you can put two batteries in or

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.760 
battery you can put two batteries in or
a<00:01:19.470> special<00:01:20.040> triple-a<00:01:20.580> battery<00:01:21.270> solution<00:01:21.770> so

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
a special triple-a battery solution so

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:23.870 
a special triple-a battery solution so
if<00:01:22.890> you're<00:01:23.009> out<00:01:23.100> in<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.189> field<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:23.700> don't

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
if you're out in the field and you don't

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.179 
if you're out in the field and you don't
have<00:01:24.030> access<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.479> whatever<00:01:25.020> style<00:01:25.740> battery

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
have access to whatever style battery

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.420 
have access to whatever style battery
you<00:01:26.340> need<00:01:26.369> that's<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.450> really<00:01:27.750> good<00:01:27.930> solution

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
you need that's a really good solution

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.550 
you need that's a really good solution
an<00:01:29.430> option<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.299> have<00:01:30.450> on<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.869> road<00:01:31.049> but<00:01:31.409> the

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
an option to have on the road but the

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.609 
an option to have on the road but the
primary<00:01:31.829> reason<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.820> use<00:01:33.210> battery<00:01:33.720> grips<00:01:34.049> isn't

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
primary reason I use battery grips isn't

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.010 
primary reason I use battery grips isn't
for<00:01:34.890> either<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.369> those<00:01:35.610> while<00:01:36.540> it<00:01:36.689> is<00:01:36.780> nice<00:01:36.990> to

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
for either of those while it is nice to

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.469 
for either of those while it is nice to
have<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.439> extra<00:01:37.470> battery<00:01:38.040> power<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.970> biggest

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
have the extra battery power the biggest

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.130 
have the extra battery power the biggest
thing<00:01:39.720> that<00:01:40.079> this<00:01:41.000> solves<00:01:42.000> problem<00:01:42.630> wise<00:01:42.810> is

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
thing that this solves problem wise is

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.620 
thing that this solves problem wise is
not<00:01:43.770> being<00:01:44.009> able<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.220> open<00:01:44.430> that<00:01:44.640> door<00:01:44.970> on<00:01:45.540> the

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
not being able to open that door on the

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.200 
not being able to open that door on the
bottom<00:01:46.079> of<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.259> camera<00:01:46.640> there<00:01:47.640> are<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:47.880> couple

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
bottom of the camera there are a couple

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.370 
bottom of the camera there are a couple
rigs

and tripods out there that take into
account<00:01:53.390> DSLRs<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.479> how<00:01:54.540> wide<00:01:54.810> they<00:01:55.049> are<00:01:55.079> and

account DSLRs and how wide they are and

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.260 
account DSLRs and how wide they are and
how<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:56.219> battery<00:01:56.549> comes<00:01:56.790> out<00:01:56.939> of<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.090> side

how the battery comes out of the side

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.450 
how the battery comes out of the side
but<00:01:57.780> I<00:01:57.810> find<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:58.200> almost<00:01:58.500> all<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:59.040> time<00:01:59.219> I'm

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
but I find that almost all the time I'm

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.130 
but I find that almost all the time I'm
running<00:01:59.820> into<00:01:59.939> issues<00:02:00.090> with<00:02:00.450> accessing<00:02:01.049> the

running into issues with accessing the

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.289 
running into issues with accessing the
battery<00:02:01.469> so<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.040> battery<00:02:02.490> grip<00:02:02.759> because<00:02:03.119> it

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
battery so the battery grip because it

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.789 
battery so the battery grip because it
allows<00:02:03.540> you<00:02:03.719> to<00:02:03.840> access<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.350> batteries<00:02:04.680> from

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
allows you to access the batteries from

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.069 
allows you to access the batteries from
the<00:02:04.920> rear<00:02:05.219> of<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.520> camera<00:02:05.909> that<00:02:06.119> kind<00:02:07.020> of

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
the rear of the camera that kind of

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.839 
the rear of the camera that kind of
fixed<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:07.500> problem<00:02:07.979> for<00:02:08.129> me<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.520> for<00:02:08.759> me

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
fixed that problem for me and for me

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.309 
fixed that problem for me and for me
it's<00:02:09.060> just<00:02:09.119> nice<00:02:09.420> to<00:02:09.450> have<00:02:09.690> that<00:02:09.750> much<00:02:10.140> more
