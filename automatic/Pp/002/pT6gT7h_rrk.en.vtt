let's<00:02:04.229> look<00:02:04.469> at<00:02:04.619> adjusting<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.310> stack

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
let's look at adjusting the stack

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.459 
let's look at adjusting the stack
sections<00:02:06.180> we'll<00:02:06.600> start<00:02:06.869> with<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.140> left<00:02:07.290> hand

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
sections we'll start with the left hand

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.770 
sections we'll start with the left hand
I'll<00:02:08.459> take<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:08.970> through<00:02:09.000> several<00:02:09.479> situations

that you'll encounter often

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.059 
that you'll encounter often
you<00:02:12.720> can<00:02:12.900> see<00:02:13.050> that<00:02:13.260> I've<00:02:13.379> removed<00:02:13.739> some<00:02:13.980> of

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
you can see that I've removed some of

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.040 
you can see that I've removed some of
the<00:02:14.129> keys<00:02:14.370> to<00:02:14.640> expose<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.239> stack<00:02:15.510> section

the keys to expose the stack section

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.890 
the keys to expose the stack section
this<00:02:17.010> is<00:02:17.069> not<00:02:17.370> done<00:02:17.610> just<00:02:17.970> for<00:02:18.120> visual<00:02:18.510> reasons

direct pressure you can use the step and

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.640 
direct pressure you can use the step and
turn<00:03:05.220> it<00:03:05.340> up<00:03:05.489> on<00:03:05.640> end<00:03:05.910> if<00:03:06.180> needed<00:03:06.840> when

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
turn it up on end if needed when

turn it up on end if needed when
adjusting<00:03:08.220> the<00:03:08.340> a<00:03:08.370> in<00:03:08.610> this<00:03:08.790> way<00:03:09.030> it's<00:03:09.629> best<00:03:09.959> to

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
adjusting the a in this way it's best to

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.220 
adjusting the a in this way it's best to
hold<00:03:10.260> both<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:10.829> key<00:03:11.040> cup<00:03:11.340> and<00:03:11.549> the<00:03:11.610> Perl<00:03:11.879> down

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
hold both the key cup and the Perl down

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.259 
hold both the key cup and the Perl down
this<00:03:13.230> helps<00:03:13.590> localize<00:03:14.099> the<00:03:14.370> Flex<00:03:14.670> to<00:03:14.910> the<00:03:15.030> foot

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
this helps localize the Flex to the foot

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.210 
this helps localize the Flex to the foot
alone<00:03:15.569> and<00:03:15.870> it's<00:03:16.470> the<00:03:16.620> foot<00:03:16.889> that<00:03:17.100> we're
