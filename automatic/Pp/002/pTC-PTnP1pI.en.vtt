00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.850
 Hello dear portal readers 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.360
 virtuspro.org we are now on 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:15.850
 Starladder’s third day and now we’ll take 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.130
 interview with one of the players virtus.pro 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:22.390
 xi 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:26.420
 hi tell me your impressions of 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:29.570
 Starladdera next arrival in Kiev as 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.880
 how it goes all hello but here again 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.670
 I really like the starladder here 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.129
 We updated the components of the device, we have only one 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.900
 since there was a problem with Ukraine, he is not 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:41.269
 very quickly decided that starladder 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.840
 growing audience more and more atmosphere 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:45.019
 cooler 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:48.980
 overall very pleased with starladder as 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:49.760
 your game characterize your game 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.339
 teams 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:56.150
 some pros may not start this minus 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:59.030
 and well we need to work more on our 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.790
 the game is like we are now more in the role 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.799
 strong mix bowl stand here these 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.600
 replacing the change of roles we still have it 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:07.140
 all public-now we get out 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.000
 serious games we 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.770
 so yesterday we had problems with it 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.270
 so we did work today 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.409
 errors hope today everything will be 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:19.470
 okay by the way about replacements as a smile joined 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.240
 the smiley team entered our team perfectly 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.100
 the team I think with the arrival of such 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.800
 Our experienced Verka x game will become even 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.220
 more aggressive than before 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:32.009
 how do you live well on new roles 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.930
 we must take time now 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.130
 bootcamp we should be scheduled tank times 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.130
 pulled up my knowledge 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:40.759
 you will have a trip to poland soon 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.960
 to the finals 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:47.920
 ps this bootcamp will just be well 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:51.350
 preparing this for this tournament will be 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.060
 besides poland you all qualifying for g-1 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.039
 the league very much want to get there 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.819
 We will just 120 times spread it 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:57.319
 Well, in general, not 

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:58.549
 and the rest of the tournament in Poland, we too 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:01.310
 very much wanted to get in so 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:02.259
 just played it better they could not 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.679
 come up with 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:09.099
 on talk about future games win and 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:12.049
 second time fnatic on this tour 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:13.730
 Well, I hope you will come in all the same should 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:15.260
 stay the same so no one 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.030
 upset to no effect 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.590
 yesterday's defeat our game so 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.959
 hopefully 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.299
 must win muscles from some 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:27.500
 cooked no for them no home 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:29.299
 blanks still such well we like us 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.980
 not really the same from this homework 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:33.410
 blanks but we have a very wide pool 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.879
 heroes we are just not many heroes 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.660
 apply because we are so more on 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:38.870
 Vera game 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.400
 because of this change of roles and the arrival of a smile 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.560
 we would like a lot more heroes 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.269
 sit on the bench as much as possible 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.480
 say so there might be some 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:49.579
 new heroes from us today will be good 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.239
 Thank you for the interview and good luck in 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:52.239
 future games
