so having a case is great and there
haven't<00:00:33.059> really<00:00:33.390> been<00:00:33.570> many<00:00:34.230> options<00:00:34.860> as<00:00:35.040> far

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
haven't really been many options as far

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.639 
haven't really been many options as far
as<00:00:35.430> cases<00:00:35.910> go<00:00:36.120> so<00:00:36.719> we're<00:00:36.840> going<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.020> unbox<00:00:37.200> and

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
as cases go so we're going to unbox and

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.200 
as cases go so we're going to unbox and
install<00:00:38.070> this<00:00:38.309> so<00:00:38.520> that<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:38.670> can<00:00:38.879> kind<00:00:39.030> of<00:00:39.090> get

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
install this so that you can kind of get

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.959 
install this so that you can kind of get
an<00:00:39.300> idea<00:00:39.420> for<00:00:39.690> what<00:00:39.870> this<00:00:40.110> case<00:00:40.320> is<00:00:40.379> all<00:00:40.680> about

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:40.969 
an idea for what this case is all about

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:44.810 
an idea for what this case is all about
so<00:00:41.969> you<00:00:42.030> pull<00:00:42.270> this<00:00:42.390> tab<00:00:42.690> right<00:00:43.020> here<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.820> to

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
so you pull this tab right here to to

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.540 
so you pull this tab right here to to
begin<00:00:45.300> opening<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.809> packaging<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:47.280> face

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
begin opening the packaging and the face

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.700 
begin opening the packaging and the face
of<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.879> packaging<00:00:48.390> this<00:00:48.510> comes<00:00:48.809> right<00:00:49.469> off

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
of the packaging this comes right off

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.979 
of the packaging this comes right off
and<00:00:50.640> then<00:00:50.730> you<00:00:50.850> can<00:00:51.000> snap<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.449> case<00:00:51.660> out<00:00:51.960> of

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
and then you can snap the case out of

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.889 
and then you can snap the case out of
the<00:00:52.469> packaging<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.329> there<00:00:54.329> isn't<00:00:54.570> really<00:00:54.660> any

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
the packaging and there isn't really any

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.840 
the packaging and there isn't really any
other<00:00:55.260> good<00:00:55.680> use<00:00:55.920> for<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.190> packaging<00:00:56.640> so

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
other good use for the packaging so

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.040 
other good use for the packaging so
we'll<00:00:56.969> go<00:00:57.059> ahead<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.239> set<00:00:57.449> that<00:00:57.480> off<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.809> the

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
we'll go ahead and set that off to the

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.740 
we'll go ahead and set that off to the
side<00:00:58.190> now<00:00:59.190> this<00:00:59.399> is<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.579> very<00:00:59.730> minimal<00:01:00.239> case<00:01:00.480> so

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
side now this is a very minimal case so

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.500 
side now this is a very minimal case so
it's<00:01:00.870> not<00:01:01.079> going<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.590> protect<00:01:02.010> against<00:01:02.550> you

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
it's not going to protect against you

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.800 
it's not going to protect against you
know<00:01:03.660> water<00:01:04.110> moisture<00:01:04.530> extreme<00:01:05.540> droppage<00:01:06.540> or

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
know water moisture extreme droppage or

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.200 
know water moisture extreme droppage or
anything<00:01:07.140> like<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.350> but<00:01:07.890> nonetheless<00:01:08.640> it

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
anything like that but nonetheless it

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.030 
anything like that but nonetheless it
will<00:01:09.450> provide<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:10.200> layer<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.010> security<00:01:13.040> over

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
will provide a layer of security over

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.149 
will provide a layer of security over
your<00:01:14.159> device<00:01:14.460> so<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.619> Nexus<00:01:17.009> is<00:01:17.130> a

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
your device so and the Nexus is a

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.910 
your device so and the Nexus is a
relatively<00:01:17.700> small<00:01:18.150> device<00:01:18.659> so<00:01:19.049> we're<00:01:19.890> just

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
relatively small device so we're just

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.330 
relatively small device so we're just
going<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.280> slide<00:01:20.610> this<00:01:20.909> right<00:01:21.119> in<00:01:21.600> now<00:01:22.340> the

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
going to slide this right in now the

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.550 
going to slide this right in now the
first<00:01:23.490> thing<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:23.850> notice<00:01:24.240> is<00:01:24.360> that<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:25.320> does

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
first thing I notice is that it does

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.070 
first thing I notice is that it does
seem<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:25.950> add<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.100> little<00:01:26.460> bit<00:01:27.299> of<00:01:27.360> thickness<00:01:27.659> to

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
seem to add a little bit of thickness to

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.550 
seem to add a little bit of thickness to
the<00:01:28.110> device<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:29.340> can<00:01:29.579> see<00:01:29.820> now<00:01:30.000> how<00:01:30.329> wide<00:01:31.110> this

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
the device you can see now how wide this

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.520 
the device you can see now how wide this
is<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.220> device<00:01:32.490> itself<00:01:32.729> is<00:01:33.210> not<00:01:33.450> that<00:01:34.229> big<00:01:34.500> of

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
is the device itself is not that big of

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.640 
is the device itself is not that big of
a<00:01:34.710> device<00:01:35.009> outside<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:35.670> this<00:01:35.790> case<00:01:36.060> so<00:01:36.650> though

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
a device outside of this case so though

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.190 
a device outside of this case so though
this<00:01:37.950> this<00:01:38.640> case<00:01:38.909> is<00:01:39.180> considered<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:39.780> bumper

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
this this case is considered a bumper

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.160 
this this case is considered a bumper
case<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:41.100> definitely<00:01:41.640> adds<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:42.150> bumper<00:01:42.659> around

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
case it definitely adds a bumper around

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.520 
case it definitely adds a bumper around
your<00:01:43.649> device<00:01:43.979> so<00:01:44.689> some<00:01:45.689> people<00:01:45.990> would<00:01:46.350> like

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
your device so some people would like

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.700 
your device so some people would like
that<00:01:46.770> some<00:01:47.070> people<00:01:47.369> do<00:01:47.759> not<00:01:48.079> the<00:01:49.079> case<00:01:49.259> itself

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
that some people do not the case itself

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.639 
that some people do not the case itself

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
it has a little bit of a beveled edge so

have<00:03:37.380> one<00:03:38.900> plug<00:03:39.900> right<00:03:40.140> here<00:03:40.220> which<00:03:41.220> typically

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
have one plug right here which typically

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.590 
have one plug right here which typically
we<00:03:42.510> use<00:03:42.540> for<00:03:43.290> recording<00:03:43.829> demos<00:03:44.190> it<00:03:45.180> would<00:03:45.390> fit

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
we use for recording demos it would fit

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.410 
we use for recording demos it would fit
perfectly<00:03:46.079> the<00:03:46.380> width<00:03:46.620> is<00:03:46.920> just<00:03:47.250> fine<00:03:47.549> it

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
perfectly the width is just fine it

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.360 
perfectly the width is just fine it
would<00:03:48.600> fit<00:03:48.810> right<00:03:48.840> into<00:03:49.230> that<00:03:49.410> slot<00:03:49.769> anything

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
would fit right into that slot anything

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.340 
would fit right into that slot anything
wider<00:03:50.610> than<00:03:50.910> this<00:03:51.120> though<00:03:51.420> and<00:03:51.690> we<00:03:52.200> would

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
wider than this though and we would

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.819 
wider than this though and we would
probably<00:03:52.590> run<00:03:52.890> into<00:03:53.100> a<00:03:53.250> problem<00:03:53.630> so<00:03:54.630> not<00:03:55.620> bad

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
probably run into a problem so not bad

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:59.600 
probably run into a problem so not bad
indeed<00:03:56.459> this<00:03:56.700> case<00:03:57.000> of<00:03:57.690> course<00:03:58.079> being<00:03:58.610> you

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
indeed this case of course being you

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.280 
indeed this case of course being you
know<00:03:59.730> a<00:03:59.760> little<00:03:59.970> expensive<00:04:00.600> for<00:04:00.660> a<00:04:00.900> bumper

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
know a little expensive for a bumper

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.400 
know a little expensive for a bumper
case<00:04:01.560> it<00:04:02.130> really<00:04:02.540> complements<00:04:03.540> the<00:04:03.690> design<00:04:04.079> of

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
case it really complements the design of

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.220 
case it really complements the design of
the<00:04:04.980> device<00:04:05.010> I<00:04:05.730> don't<00:04:06.180> feel<00:04:06.420> that<00:04:06.450> I'm<00:04:06.750> losing

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
the device I don't feel that I'm losing

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.699 
the device I don't feel that I'm losing
anything<00:04:07.530> on<00:04:07.950> this<00:04:08.640> so<00:04:09.180> let's<00:04:09.390> try<00:04:09.660> the<00:04:10.350> button

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
anything on this so let's try the button

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.370 
anything on this so let's try the button
so<00:04:11.070> the<00:04:12.000> power<00:04:12.150> button<00:04:12.480> over<00:04:12.810> here<00:04:12.840> the<00:04:13.200> lock

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
so the power button over here the lock

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.770 
so the power button over here the lock
button<00:04:13.709> takes<00:04:14.370> a<00:04:14.579> little<00:04:14.760> bit<00:04:14.940> more<00:04:15.209> effort<00:04:15.390> to

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
button takes a little bit more effort to

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.800 
button takes a little bit more effort to
push<00:04:15.959> down<00:04:15.989> than<00:04:16.530> normal<00:04:17.030> and<00:04:18.030> then<00:04:18.419> let's

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
push down than normal and then let's

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:24.620 
push down than normal and then let's
let's<00:04:19.709> just<00:04:19.979> go<00:04:20.250> and<00:04:22.370> let<00:04:23.370> me<00:04:23.490> get<00:04:23.700> over<00:04:24.479> to

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
let's just go and let me get over to

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.060 
let's just go and let me get over to
another<00:04:24.900> page<00:04:25.169> here

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:34.500 

volume<00:04:30.070> buttons<00:04:31.110> not<00:04:32.110> bad<00:04:33.420> doesn't<00:04:34.420> really

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
volume buttons not bad doesn't really

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:36.210 
volume buttons not bad doesn't really
block<00:04:34.840> anything<00:04:35.140> else<00:04:35.470> so<00:04:35.740> I<00:04:35.770> don't<00:04:36.010> think

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
block anything else so I don't think

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.090 
block anything else so I don't think
that<00:04:36.310> we're<00:04:37.140> you<00:04:38.140> know<00:04:38.170> running<00:04:38.620> into<00:04:38.920> any

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
that we're you know running into any

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.910 
that we're you know running into any
issues<00:04:39.310> with<00:04:40.240> the<00:04:40.450> button<00:04:40.750> so<00:04:41.050> it<00:04:41.440> tends<00:04:41.830> to

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:41.920 
issues with the button so it tends to

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.610 
issues with the button so it tends to
work<00:04:42.100> pretty<00:04:42.160> good<00:04:42.430> this<00:04:42.790> this<00:04:43.420> case<00:04:43.720> a<00:04:44.110> lot<00:04:44.320> of

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
work pretty good this this case a lot of

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.680 
work pretty good this this case a lot of
times<00:04:44.830> these<00:04:45.100> rubberized<00:04:45.700> buttons<00:04:46.180> cause<00:04:46.420> you

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
times these rubberized buttons cause you

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.100 
times these rubberized buttons cause you
issues<00:04:47.140> and<00:04:48.150> the<00:04:49.150> you<00:04:49.450> know<00:04:49.570> you<00:04:49.630> lose<00:04:49.900> some

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
issues and the you know you lose some

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.720 
issues and the you know you lose some
performance<00:04:50.710> because<00:04:51.040> of<00:04:51.130> the<00:04:51.220> case<00:04:51.430> but

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:51.730 
performance because of the case but

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.030 
performance because of the case but
overall<00:04:52.090> this<00:04:52.390> is<00:04:52.450> a<00:04:52.570> good<00:04:52.810> case<00:04:53.110> it<00:04:53.560> is<00:04:53.770> a<00:04:53.800> case

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040 
overall this is a good case it is a case

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.560 
overall this is a good case it is a case
that<00:04:54.280> I<00:04:54.310> would<00:04:54.490> want<00:04:54.670> to<00:04:54.730> keep<00:04:54.910> on<00:04:55.150> my<00:04:55.390> device

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 
that I would want to keep on my device

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.950 
that I would want to keep on my device
obviously<00:04:56.050> to<00:04:56.500> protect<00:04:56.920> it<00:04:57.630> being<00:04:58.630> that<00:04:58.840> this

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
obviously to protect it being that this

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.890 
obviously to protect it being that this
is<00:04:59.020> a<00:04:59.170> small<00:04:59.800> sleek<00:05:00.280> device<00:05:01.000> the<00:05:01.300> phone<00:05:01.510> itself

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
is a small sleek device the phone itself

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.410 
is a small sleek device the phone itself
I<00:05:02.230> wouldn't<00:05:02.740> want<00:05:02.920> to<00:05:02.980> add<00:05:03.130> too<00:05:03.430> much<00:05:03.610> bulk<00:05:04.120> to

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:04.420 
I wouldn't want to add too much bulk to

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.990 
I wouldn't want to add too much bulk to
it<00:05:04.600> I<00:05:04.780> feel<00:05:05.350> like<00:05:05.560> if<00:05:05.860> I<00:05:06.010> dropped<00:05:06.370> this<00:05:06.640> on<00:05:06.850> the

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
it I feel like if I dropped this on the

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.030 
it I feel like if I dropped this on the
corner<00:05:07.450> this<00:05:07.960> would<00:05:08.170> do<00:05:08.290> a<00:05:08.320> relatively<00:05:08.890> good

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:09.040 
corner this would do a relatively good

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.370 
corner this would do a relatively good
job<00:05:09.460> of<00:05:09.490> protecting<00:05:10.060> my<00:05:10.690> device<00:05:11.050> obviously

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
job of protecting my device obviously

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.980 
job of protecting my device obviously
there's<00:05:12.220> no<00:05:12.280> front<00:05:12.790> face<00:05:13.120> on<00:05:13.420> this<00:05:13.690> so

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
there's no front face on this so

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.100 
there's no front face on this so
anything<00:05:14.830> that<00:05:14.860> that<00:05:15.340> was<00:05:15.820> raised<00:05:16.180> could<00:05:16.900> hit

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
anything that that was raised could hit

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.070 
anything that that was raised could hit
the<00:05:17.230> glass<00:05:17.500> although<00:05:18.340> as<00:05:18.580> you<00:05:18.790> can<00:05:18.970> see<00:05:19.270> if<00:05:19.870> I

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
the glass although as you can see if I

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.500 
the glass although as you can see if I
hold<00:05:20.320> the<00:05:20.530> phone<00:05:20.950> at<00:05:21.130> an<00:05:21.250> angle<00:05:21.610> here<00:05:21.880> you<00:05:22.360> can

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:22.510 
hold the phone at an angle here you can

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:28.260 
hold the phone at an angle here you can
see<00:05:22.690> that<00:05:22.870> there<00:05:23.020> is<00:05:23.050> a<00:05:23.790> lip<00:05:25.740> so<00:05:26.740> if<00:05:27.460> I<00:05:27.670> was<00:05:27.940> if

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
see that there is a lip so if I was if

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.510 
see that there is a lip so if I was if
my<00:05:28.480> phone<00:05:28.690> was<00:05:28.960> to<00:05:29.170> slide<00:05:29.530> on<00:05:29.770> the<00:05:29.920> face<00:05:30.190> as

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 
my phone was to slide on the face as

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.220 
my phone was to slide on the face as
long<00:05:31.030> as<00:05:31.060> there<00:05:31.300> weren't<00:05:31.570> any<00:05:31.660> rocks<00:05:31.990> or

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:32.230 
long as there weren't any rocks or

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:33.690 
long as there weren't any rocks or
anything<00:05:32.590> sharp<00:05:32.920> I<00:05:33.160> wouldn't<00:05:33.460> have<00:05:33.580> any

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:33.700 
anything sharp I wouldn't have any

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.060 
anything sharp I wouldn't have any
issues<00:05:34.090> with<00:05:34.240> the<00:05:34.390> glass<00:05:34.630> getting<00:05:35.020> scraped<00:05:35.380> so

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.070 
issues with the glass getting scraped so

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.940 
issues with the glass getting scraped so
overall<00:05:36.760> really<00:05:37.240> good<00:05:37.360> case<00:05:37.810> I<00:05:38.050> think<00:05:38.080> that<00:05:38.560> it

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:38.950 
overall really good case I think that it

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:40.680 
overall really good case I think that it
was<00:05:39.100> well<00:05:39.340> worth<00:05:39.370> the<00:05:39.610> wait<00:05:40.000> although<00:05:40.480> I<00:05:40.510> don't

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.690 
was well worth the wait although I don't

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:43.770 
was well worth the wait although I don't
understand<00:05:41.350> the<00:05:41.500> weight<00:05:41.700> it<00:05:42.700> was<00:05:42.940> a<00:05:42.970> good<00:05:43.510> it's

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:43.780 
understand the weight it was a good it's

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.020 
understand the weight it was a good it's
a<00:05:43.900> good<00:05:43.930> case<00:05:44.290> indeed<00:05:44.770> comes<00:05:45.370> in<00:05:45.520> a<00:05:45.580> variety<00:05:45.700> of

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:46.030 
a good case indeed comes in a variety of

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.550 
a good case indeed comes in a variety of
different<00:05:46.210> colors<00:05:46.660> i<00:05:46.900> went<00:05:47.110> with<00:05:47.230> black

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560 
different colors i went with black

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.090 
different colors i went with black
because<00:05:48.120> my<00:05:49.120> black<00:05:49.390> nexus<00:05:49.840> 5<00:05:50.080> I<00:05:50.410> just<00:05:50.830> wanted

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:51.100 
because my black nexus 5 I just wanted

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.700 
because my black nexus 5 I just wanted
to<00:05:51.130> keep<00:05:51.360> consistent<00:05:52.360> there<00:05:52.570> and<00:05:52.780> I'm<00:05:53.320> not<00:05:53.500> too

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:53.710 
to keep consistent there and I'm not too

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.710 
to keep consistent there and I'm not too
flashy<00:05:54.310> when<00:05:54.700> it<00:05:54.820> comes<00:05:55.000> to<00:05:55.150> cases<00:05:55.360> in<00:05:55.630> the

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:55.720 
flashy when it comes to cases in the

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.170 
flashy when it comes to cases in the
first<00:05:55.930> place<00:05:56.110> so<00:05:56.400> not<00:05:57.400> a<00:05:57.430> bad<00:05:57.610> case<00:05:57.940> from

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:58.180
