00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.200
 and a couple of months ago we received a 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.850
 letter from cecilia a viewer 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.390
 worried after the visit of a seller 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:12.280
 of leaves your letter says like that when he 

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:15.250
 explain the benefits of these sheets 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.980
 that are surgical steel tells me that 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.859
 of aluminum particles are released 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.029
 since they are porous they are deposited 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:24.759
 remains of food that accumulate 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.259
 bacteria instead of the leaves of 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:29.259
 Iron unused says the des 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:30.909
 porthole is the oxide mixed with the 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:32.800
 foods and that are painted with paint 

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:35.350
 of car that is coming out and 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.329
 mixing with the food as for 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.460
 the Teflon pots and pans says that 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:41.160
 in each cooking of the food is 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.960
 they release particles highly 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.300
 cancerous and still good not 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.289
 we investigate and this is what we 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.289
 said those who know 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.180
 pots pans and other utensils 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.890
 kitchen have been put in the pillory for 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.270
 the aggressive campaign of some companies 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.940
 who sell steel implements 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.130
 surgical to cook for example 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.600
 they say that the teflon the cover 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.129
 non-stick that have some 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.320
 pans gives off acid 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.660
 perfluorooctanoic a substance 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.040
 indestructible and cumulative that is 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.710
 deposit in our body until 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.229
 cause liver problems stability and 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.420
 even endocrine cancer but it will be 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.320
 true the third party does not do it 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.420
 more you that exist in nature 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.220
 then as I told you at the beginning 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.280
 it may be that they divide certain 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.729
 compounds but that exists 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.610
 bioaccumulation is impossible that's not 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.979
 truth and there are more based on a study 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.780
 of the 70s ensure that cooking in pots 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.450
 of aluminum causes poisoning and 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.490
 also Alzheimer's but later and 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.290
 numerous investigations did not find 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.380
 no link between aluminum and 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.909
 risk of suffering from this disease 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.590
 if the aluminum of the prints was 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.829
 poisonous our grandparents would have died 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.149
 of that because everyone used them 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:57.380
 but also until today it continues 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.500
 using aluminum foil for 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.520
 cooking and preserving food ensure 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.710
 even that steel pots 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.689
 more expensive stainless are also 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.530
 harmful because they give off iron and 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:11.420
 carbon that we end up ingesting 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.550
 steel components it is possible that 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.680
 free but the amounts that should 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.080
 there they are almost undetectable by 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.799
 any analytical system is worth 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.599
 then new factor is then a 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:25.069
 time nothing of the competition serves its 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:26.739
 Surgical steel products would be 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.330
 the only ones who would avoid these risks 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.940
 but they are just exaggerations that cause 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.930
 fear of consumers to sell 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.849
 because absolutely all 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.319
 kitchen utensils including those of 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.910
 when they get warm they eliminate 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.400
 tiny amounts of substances 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.079
 chemicals that are not harmful all 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.120
 the products that are consumed or 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:46.370
 sell is not managed have gone through 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.920
 a series of toxicity tests and 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.690
 market in the food cost and all 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.210
 they definitely have proof that they do not 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.610
 are 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.680
 toxic affect health to be able to 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.930
 be sold but simply do not go out to 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.420
 Market no pots and pans 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.070
 miraculous some will last you more for the 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.380
 material with which they are made but they are 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.450
 much more expensive than the rest then 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.420
 the risk is not for your health but for 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.370
 your pocket and one more myth of poisons 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.780
 in the kitchen it is also not true that 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.730
 plastic containers that we use to 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.930
 heat food in the microwave 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.300
 release dioxins or other substances 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.070
 cancer for you ignite 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.560
 these toxins the plastics should 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.120
 contain chlorine or carbon and be submitted 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.430
 at temperatures much higher than 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.930
 of the microwave so it's best not to believe 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.930
 everything you read or you are told 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.319
 good examples like these there are many 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.780
 to sell products especially the most 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:41.879
 expensive myths are sometimes invented without the 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.410
 lower scientific base Cecilia told us 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:45.690
 also that you have offered filters of 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.849
 water telling him to drink boiled water 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:51.030
 It does not work because you are losing your 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:54.209
 nutrients and it becomes dead water 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.769
 that's even funnier dead water that 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.140
 it means that when the water is 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:00.120
 evaporates and becomes clouds is already 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.220
 dead goes to heaven as they admit penalty 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.769
 and then death falls in the form of rain 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.680
 people that we all take from the tap or 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:09.590
 of the bottle with or without end how much 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.330
 foolishness 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.220
 and when they try to put fear 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.019
 require scientific evidence of what 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.920
 affirm remember that sometimes for 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:17.920
 sell what is said
