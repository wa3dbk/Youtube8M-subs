00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.120
 and 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:17.760
 the plate that we are going to use is a 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:22.349
 plate with agglomerate base and a foil 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:25.289
 a melamine paper that covers both 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:27.839
 faces these plates come in different 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:32.480
 thicknesses we are going to work a 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:32.480
 plate in 18 millimeters thick 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:38.210
 we are going to perform in this case different 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:40.820
 types of furniture cupboard type different 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:44.460
 measures so that you have an idea of 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.680
 how to assemble one and another 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.800
 well let's work now in the 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.750
 section loves vertical is a machine 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:01:00.690
 which is used to make the cuts 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:01:02.550
 thick is to say the tranza us 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.030
 we have cut then all the 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.170
 plates of the same width is ready to 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.390
 put together the pictures 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.620
 and our furniture then what 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:18.640
 we have to do is 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:22.540
 make a cinnamon dor or rebate for what 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:25.000
 the bottom and be part of the width of 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.100
 our wood 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.740
 well we already have all of our 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.710
 cut plates to start plugging 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:35.280
 the edges 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:38.159
 let's use this melamine edge 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.729
 which is neither more nor less than the role that 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:46.320
 It is used to line the plate with a 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:49.170
 rubberized backing in this case for 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:53.030
 can easily paste it with a machine 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.030
 heat with a heat gun 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:15.440
 for this armed we are going to need some 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:20.830
 wicks for boring 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.830
 of the diameter measurement of the screw 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:40.130
 then the fund is going to be fixed 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:43.130
 initially with some nails so that 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.910
 do not move or leave place and 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:49.310
 then we are going to screw it 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:52.040
 directly without hole or anything with the 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:56.330
 breasts or self piercing that is going to 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:03:13.280
 allow to have a perfect anchorage of 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:15.680
 background and also very very sure we are going to 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:19.760
 use to place the brackets for 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:22.760
 the constants a template with three 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.910
 holes where the 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.819
 shelf to the height that the user 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:31.160
 require then let's support the 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:32.520
 greater distance over the edge of the 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.550
 piece of furniture 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:38.550
 and let's drill directly with the 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:41.520
 machine the three holes is to say in 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:44.700
 the four sides we will make the 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:47.370
 three holes and there we're going to get 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:51.830
 a perfect leveling with a 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.830
 salt regulation 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:02.030
 good to place then our 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:05.060
 hinge on the doors we're going to have to 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:07.220
 use this machine a boring machine 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.750
 bank 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:13.550
 and put a drill for boring 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:16.060
 just with the measure that the 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.060
 hinge 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:25.540
 let's place then our hinge 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:28.620
 trying to make the placement angle 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.620
 be 90 degrees 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.240
 ah 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.240
 ah 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.390
 the only thing that remains is to place 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.190
 the handles or pulls what you 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:52.400
 let's go place then let's 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:55.750
 mark at a distance let's drill 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.750
 and place the shooters
