stock<00:00:20.580> you<00:00:21.449> might<00:00:21.660> not<00:00:21.779> have<00:00:22.020> as<00:00:22.500> much<00:00:22.949> alpha

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
stock you might not have as much alpha

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.310 
stock you might not have as much alpha
as<00:00:24.000> you<00:00:24.210> would<00:00:24.420> want<00:00:24.600> with<00:00:24.840> it<00:00:24.960> here<00:00:25.140> nine

as you would want with it here nine
already<00:00:25.699> but<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:27.599> accuracy<00:00:28.140> is<00:00:28.170> still<00:00:28.619> good

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
already but the accuracy is still good

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.160 
already but the accuracy is still good
enough<00:00:28.949> with<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:30.090> damage<00:00:30.480> that<00:00:30.510> you<00:00:30.750> do<00:00:30.960> do

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
enough with the damage that you do do

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.500 
enough with the damage that you do do
that<00:00:31.610> um<00:00:33.380> it's<00:00:34.380> not<00:00:34.559> that<00:00:34.950> big<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.120> negative

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
that um it's not that big of a negative

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.049 
that um it's not that big of a negative
and<00:00:36.780> yes<00:00:37.380> I<00:00:37.590> guess<00:00:37.739> I<00:00:37.920> do<00:00:38.100> do<00:00:39.170> but<00:00:40.170> on<00:00:41.030> the<00:00:42.030> good

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
and yes I guess I do do but on the good

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.490 
and yes I guess I do do but on the good
thing<00:00:42.420> about<00:00:42.450> this<00:00:42.719> already<00:00:42.960> is<00:00:43.140> it's

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
thing about this already is it's

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.680 
thing about this already is it's
actually<00:00:43.649> close<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.820> tier<00:00:45.059> 10<00:00:45.270> already<00:00:45.480> in

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
actually close to the tier 10 already in

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.299 
actually close to the tier 10 already in
my<00:00:45.809> opinion<00:00:46.079> I<00:00:46.379> actually<00:00:46.649> kind<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:47.100> like<00:00:47.190> it

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
my opinion I actually kind of like it

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.319 
my opinion I actually kind of like it
more<00:00:47.700> than<00:00:47.760> 80<00:00:48.239> 92<00:00:48.570> when<00:00:48.989> it's<00:00:49.140> upgraded

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
more than 80 92 when it's upgraded

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:53.240 
more than 80 92 when it's upgraded
because<00:00:51.329> it's<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.570> lot<00:00:51.899> more<00:00:51.930> reliable<00:00:52.920> you

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
because it's a lot more reliable you

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.360 
because it's a lot more reliable you
might<00:00:53.430> not<00:00:53.579> hit<00:00:53.820> for<00:00:53.879> as<00:00:54.210> much<00:00:54.360> as<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.600> tea<00:00:54.840> 92

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
might not hit for as much as a tea 92

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:01.729 
might not hit for as much as a tea 92
but<00:00:56.370> you<00:00:56.610> definitely<00:00:58.850> m-more<00:00:59.850> or<00:01:00.449> you're<00:01:01.440> more

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
but you definitely m-more or you're more

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.550 
but you definitely m-more or you're more
consistent<00:01:02.340> than<00:01:02.399> 80<00:01:02.969> 92<00:01:05.720> now<00:01:06.720> i<00:01:06.780> am<00:01:07.200> recording

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560

unfortunately

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.780 

you<00:01:47.380> just<00:01:47.680> knock<00:01:47.860> out<00:01:48.040> that<00:01:48.070> building<00:01:48.430> real

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
you just knock out that building real

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:59.280 
you just knock out that building real
quick<00:01:55.830> and<00:01:56.830> as<00:01:56.980> you<00:01:57.100> see<00:01:57.340> here<00:01:57.610> the<00:01:58.020> arc<00:01:59.020> on

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 
quick and as you see here the arc on

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.340 
quick and as you see here the arc on
this<00:01:59.500> thing<00:01:59.770> because<00:02:00.520> it<00:02:00.550> has<00:02:00.760> a<00:02:01.350> significant

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
this thing because it has a significant

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.160 
this thing because it has a significant
half<00:02:02.560> target<00:02:03.010> per<00:02:03.190> se<00:02:03.430> the<00:02:04.270> Archon<00:02:04.630> it's<00:02:04.840> very

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
half target per se the Archon it's very

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.650 
half target per se the Archon it's very
good<00:02:05.470> as<00:02:05.980> far<00:02:06.220> as<00:02:06.370> moving<00:02:06.640> left<00:02:06.910> and<00:02:07.030> right<00:02:07.300> the

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660 
good as far as moving left and right the

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.100 
good as far as moving left and right the
gun<00:02:08.110> tours<00:02:08.530> so<00:02:09.460> you're<00:02:09.610> able<00:02:09.700> to<00:02:09.880> cover<00:02:10.119> almost

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
gun tours so you're able to cover almost

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.280 
gun tours so you're able to cover almost
the<00:02:11.920> entire<00:02:12.250> map<00:02:12.610> without<00:02:13.420> needing<00:02:14.020> to<00:02:14.050> move

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
the entire map without needing to move

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:21.090 
the entire map without needing to move
your<00:02:14.500> whole<00:02:18.900> ok<00:02:19.900> so<00:02:19.960> hopefully<00:02:20.590> they<00:02:20.710> can<00:02:20.770> spot

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
your whole ok so hopefully they can spot

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.270 
your whole ok so hopefully they can spot
that<00:02:21.130> you<00:02:21.280> 75<00:02:21.880> one<00:02:22.120> more<00:02:22.300> time<00:02:22.540> and<00:02:23.070> I'll<00:02:24.070> try

00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:20.199 
when it doesn't happen to you this was a

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:24.570 
when it doesn't happen to you this was a
pretty<00:04:20.530> he's<00:04:21.160> an<00:04:21.370> easy<00:04:21.729> victory<00:04:23.130> our<00:04:24.130> team<00:04:24.400> did

pretty<00:04:24.789> well<00:04:24.910> and<00:04:25.210> work<00:04:25.389> together<00:04:25.570> I<00:04:26.610> think

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
pretty well and work together I think

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.980 
pretty well and work together I think
most<00:04:28.330> teams<00:04:28.660> fail<00:04:29.139> it<00:04:29.440> doing<00:04:30.010> on<00:04:30.130> this<00:04:30.280> map<00:04:30.520> is

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
most teams fail it doing on this map is

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.200 
most teams fail it doing on this map is
they'll<00:04:31.990> push<00:04:32.260> the<00:04:32.500> left<00:04:32.710> side<00:04:32.979> but<00:04:33.789> focused

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
they'll push the left side but focused

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.390 
they'll push the left side but focused
too<00:04:34.419> much<00:04:34.449> on<00:04:34.720> the<00:04:34.870> hill<00:04:35.110> and<00:04:35.860> they<00:04:36.039> won't<00:04:36.250> get

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
too much on the hill and they won't get

too much on the hill and they won't get
the<00:04:36.580> lower<00:04:36.760> areas<00:04:37.360> there<00:04:37.660> and<00:04:37.930> then<00:04:38.530> even<00:04:38.740> if
