00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
hey guys ehren here with a quick review

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.019 
hey guys ehren here with a quick review
of<00:00:03.840> the<00:00:04.259> SE<00:00:04.680> electronics<00:00:05.000> reflexion<00:00:06.000> filter

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
of the SE electronics reflexion filter

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:14.270 
of the SE electronics reflexion filter
and<00:00:06.750> that<00:00:07.200> spelled<00:00:07.580> refl<00:00:08.580> e<00:00:08.849> x<00:00:09.300> io<00:00:09.840> n<00:00:10.380> and<00:00:13.280> SE

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
and that spelled refl e x io n and SE

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.180 
and that spelled refl e x io n and SE
electronics<00:00:14.460> they<00:00:15.269> actually<00:00:15.630> make<00:00:15.839> two

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:16.190 
electronics they actually make two

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:17.870 
electronics they actually make two
reflection<00:00:17.190> filters<00:00:17.640> a

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
reflection filters a

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.990 
reflection filters a
three-hundred-dollar<00:00:18.869> one<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:20.000> a

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
three-hundred-dollar one and a

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.490 
three-hundred-dollar one and a
two-hundred-dollar<00:00:21.930> one<00:00:22.140> this<00:00:22.260> is<00:00:22.320> the

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
two-hundred-dollar one this is the

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.170 
two-hundred-dollar one this is the
two-hundred-dollar<00:00:23.279> one<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:24.500> they're<00:00:25.500> both

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
two-hundred-dollar one and they're both

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.550 
two-hundred-dollar one and they're both
very<00:00:27.180> high<00:00:27.480> quality<00:00:27.750> but<00:00:28.140> they're<00:00:28.260> also<00:00:28.410> very

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
very high quality but they're also very

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.200 
very high quality but they're also very
heavy<00:00:29.099> this<00:00:29.369> one<00:00:29.609> is<00:00:29.789> actually<00:00:30.090> so<00:00:30.720> heavy<00:00:31.050> that

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
heavy this one is actually so heavy that

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.990 
heavy this one is actually so heavy that
I<00:00:33.210> can<00:00:33.390> only<00:00:33.510> record<00:00:33.870> sitting<00:00:34.350> down<00:00:35.000> because

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
I can only record sitting down because

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.709 
I can only record sitting down because
it<00:00:36.719> weighs<00:00:37.440> 10<00:00:37.800> pounds<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.579> if<00:00:39.239> I<00:00:39.450> actually

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
it weighs 10 pounds and if I actually

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.639 
it weighs 10 pounds and if I actually
arm<00:00:41.450> stretch<00:00:42.450> out<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:43.129> stand<00:00:44.129> all<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:45.090> way<00:00:45.120> up

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649 
arm stretch out the stand all the way up

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:48.560 
arm stretch out the stand all the way up
tall<00:00:46.649> enough<00:00:46.920> for<00:00:46.950> me<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.820> stand<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.390> speak

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
tall enough for me to stand and speak

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.979 
tall enough for me to stand and speak
into<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.770> microphone<00:00:50.239> it'll<00:00:51.239> actually<00:00:51.449> be<00:00:51.660> so

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
into the microphone it'll actually be so

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.580 
into the microphone it'll actually be so
top-heavy<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.989> completely<00:00:54.989> just<00:00:55.350> tips

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
top-heavy that it completely just tips

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.770 
top-heavy that it completely just tips
over<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.219> I<00:00:56.550> know<00:00:56.610> because<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.360> happened<00:00:57.390> to

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
over and I know because it happened to

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.729 
over and I know because it happened to
me<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.550> I'm<00:00:59.780> one<00:01:00.780> thing<00:01:00.809> I've<00:01:01.170> noticed<00:01:01.350> is

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
me and I'm one thing I've noticed is

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.880 
me and I'm one thing I've noticed is
that<00:01:02.329> the<00:01:03.329> quality<00:01:03.629> isn't<00:01:04.110> quite<00:01:04.530> what<00:01:04.739> do<00:01:04.830> you

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
that the quality isn't quite what do you

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.200 
that the quality isn't quite what do you
expect<00:01:05.369> uh<00:01:05.640> there<00:01:06.360> are<00:01:06.540> some<00:01:06.840> spots<00:01:07.200> here<00:01:07.770> on

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
expect uh there are some spots here on

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.390 
expect uh there are some spots here on
let<00:01:09.210> me<00:01:09.299> see<00:01:09.479> if<00:01:09.540> I<00:01:09.630> can<00:01:09.750> find<00:01:09.960> one<00:01:10.229> like<00:01:10.860> right

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
let me see if I can find one like right

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.429 
let me see if I can find one like right
here<00:01:11.700> I<00:01:11.729> don't<00:01:11.939> know<00:01:12.030> if<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.180> could<00:01:12.270> see<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.659> it

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
here I don't know if you could see it it

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.520 
here I don't know if you could see it it
actually<00:01:13.760> as<00:01:14.760> soon<00:01:15.210> as<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:15.450> got<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:16.380> could

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
actually as soon as I got it you could

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.719 
actually as soon as I got it you could
tell<00:01:16.740> it's<00:01:16.950> not<00:01:17.100> very<00:01:17.960> well<00:01:19.159> attached<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:20.640> I

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
tell it's not very well attached to it I

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.370 
tell it's not very well attached to it I
don't<00:01:20.790> know<00:01:20.939> if<00:01:21.060> they<00:01:21.210> glue<00:01:21.479> it<00:01:21.689> on<00:01:21.869> or<00:01:22.170> what

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
don't know if they glue it on or what

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.640 
don't know if they glue it on or what
but<00:01:22.710> I<00:01:24.080> don't<00:01:25.080> know<00:01:25.170> if<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.350> can<00:01:25.470> actually

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
but I don't know if you can actually

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.219 
but I don't know if you can actually
hear<00:01:25.979> that<00:01:26.220> it<00:01:26.610> so<00:01:27.570> just<00:01:27.780> be<00:01:27.900> very<00:01:27.930> careful

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
hear that it so just be very careful

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.990 
hear that it so just be very careful
with<00:01:28.740> it<00:01:28.860> because<00:01:29.009> it<00:01:29.280> could<00:01:29.400> come<00:01:29.610> off<00:01:29.790> very

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
with it because it could come off very

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.120 
with it because it could come off very
easily<00:01:30.270> um<00:01:32.299> the<00:01:33.299> performance<00:01:34.049> I<00:01:34.320> give<00:01:34.979> the

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
easily um the performance I give the

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.100 
easily um the performance I give the
performance<00:01:35.520> of<00:01:35.850> seven<00:01:36.270> out<00:01:36.689> of<00:01:36.960> 10<00:01:37.350> because

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
performance of seven out of 10 because

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.380 
performance of seven out of 10 because
first<00:01:40.110> of<00:01:40.229> all<00:01:40.380> let<00:01:41.250> me<00:01:41.280> tell<00:01:41.369> you<00:01:41.670> what<00:01:42.180> a

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
first of all let me tell you what a

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.990 
first of all let me tell you what a
reflexion<00:01:42.960> filter<00:01:42.990> is<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.970> reflexion<00:01:44.970> filter

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
reflexion filter is a reflexion filter

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.359 
reflexion filter is a reflexion filter
is<00:01:45.810> not<00:01:46.799> designed<00:01:47.340> for<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:48.240> sole<00:01:48.270> purpose<00:01:48.509> of

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
is not designed for the sole purpose of

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:52.850 
is not designed for the sole purpose of
just<00:01:50.369> simply<00:01:50.909> making<00:01:51.600> your<00:01:51.990> vocal<00:01:52.590> sound

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
just simply making your vocal sound

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.789 
just simply making your vocal sound
better<00:01:53.210> the<00:01:54.210> reason<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.750> purpose<00:01:55.140> of<00:01:55.320> a

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
better the reason the purpose of a

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.480 
better the reason the purpose of a
reflexion<00:01:56.340> filter<00:01:56.369> is<00:01:56.969> used<00:01:57.360> because<00:01:58.490> when

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
reflexion filter is used because when

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.010 
reflexion filter is used because when
you<00:01:59.610> speak<00:02:00.000> your<00:02:00.979> vocals<00:02:02.360> you're<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.780> sound

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
you speak your vocals you're the sound

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.870 
you speak your vocals you're the sound
waste<00:02:04.200> when<00:02:04.380> your<00:02:04.500> vocals<00:02:04.890> go<00:02:05.040> all<00:02:05.280> over<00:02:05.640> the

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
waste when your vocals go all over the

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.410 
waste when your vocals go all over the
room<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:07.020> entire<00:02:07.200> room<00:02:07.740> they<00:02:07.979> spread<00:02:08.340> out<00:02:08.420> so

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
room the entire room they spread out so

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.979 
room the entire room they spread out so
sometimes<00:02:09.780> it<00:02:10.170> sounds<00:02:10.550> like<00:02:11.550> you're<00:02:11.910> you<00:02:12.870> know

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
sometimes it sounds like you're you know

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.700 
sometimes it sounds like you're you know
in<00:02:13.200> a

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
in a

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.290 
in a
a<00:02:13.770> lot<00:02:13.890> bigger<00:02:14.190> room<00:02:14.430> than<00:02:14.460> you<00:02:14.760> are<00:02:14.940> sometimes

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
a lot bigger room than you are sometimes

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.370 
a lot bigger room than you are sometimes
it<00:02:15.660> echoes<00:02:16.200> off<00:02:16.410> of<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.710> walls<00:02:16.950> and<00:02:17.310> this<00:02:17.850> is

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
it echoes off of the walls and this is

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.230 
it echoes off of the walls and this is
the<00:02:19.380> purpose<00:02:19.800> of<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:20.160> reflexion<00:02:20.640> filter<00:02:20.670> to

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
the purpose of the reflexion filter to

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.750 
the purpose of the reflexion filter to
stop<00:02:21.510> that<00:02:21.750> echoes<00:02:22.230> to<00:02:22.800> stop<00:02:23.010> it<00:02:23.160> from<00:02:23.250> echoing

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
stop that echoes to stop it from echoing

off the wall and to get a more clear

crisp sound by keeping most of your

crisp sound by keeping most of your
sound<00:02:31.650> waves<00:02:31.950> in<00:02:32.280> this<00:02:32.970> ratio<00:02:33.270> right<00:02:33.750> here<00:02:34.110> and

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
sound waves in this ratio right here and

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.370 
sound waves in this ratio right here and
there<00:02:36.030> are<00:02:36.180> a<00:02:36.240> lot<00:02:36.420> of<00:02:36.450> different<00:02:36.930> settings

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
there are a lot of different settings

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.880 
there are a lot of different settings
you<00:02:37.710> can<00:02:37.740> adjust<00:02:38.280> it<00:02:38.510> for<00:02:39.510> instance<00:02:40.500> you<00:02:40.680> can

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
you can adjust it for instance you can

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.970 
you can adjust it for instance you can
actually<00:02:41.640> twist<00:02:42.390> this<00:02:42.630> and<00:02:42.930> you<00:02:43.260> can<00:02:43.290> bring<00:02:43.800> it

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
actually twist this and you can bring it

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.310 
actually twist this and you can bring it
forward<00:02:44.280> more<00:02:44.520> you<00:02:44.760> can<00:02:44.880> bring<00:02:45.120> it<00:02:45.240> back<00:02:45.480> this

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
forward more you can bring it back this

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.840 
forward more you can bring it back this
top<00:02:47.190> piece<00:02:47.490> as<00:02:47.820> you<00:02:48.240> can<00:02:48.360> see<00:02:48.600> right<00:02:48.840> here<00:02:49.850> you

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
top piece as you can see right here you

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.210 
top piece as you can see right here you
can<00:02:51.120> adjust<00:02:51.390> it<00:02:51.870> and<00:02:52.050> you<00:02:52.230> can<00:02:52.410> raise<00:02:52.710> it<00:02:52.740> and

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
can adjust it and you can raise it and

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.870 
can adjust it and you can raise it and
lower<00:02:53.850> it<00:02:54.180> so<00:02:55.050> far<00:02:55.320> I've<00:02:55.710> come<00:02:56.100> to<00:02:56.760> the

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
lower it so far I've come to the

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.360 
lower it so far I've come to the
conclusion<00:02:56.910> that<00:02:57.480> this<00:02:57.690> is<00:02:57.870> the<00:02:57.990> best

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
conclusion that this is the best

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.740 
conclusion that this is the best
adjustment<00:02:59.370> right<00:02:59.490> here<00:02:59.790> this<00:02:59.970> is<00:03:00.150> where<00:03:00.510> it

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
adjustment right here this is where it

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.190 
adjustment right here this is where it
works<00:03:01.020> the<00:03:01.800> best<00:03:02.010> you<00:03:02.310> want<00:03:02.690> more<00:03:03.690> at<00:03:03.840> the<00:03:03.960> top

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
works the best you want more at the top

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.150 
works the best you want more at the top
then<00:03:05.150> the<00:03:06.150> bottom<00:03:06.510> you<00:03:06.630> want<00:03:06.810> it<00:03:06.930> higher

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
then the bottom you want it higher

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.320 
then the bottom you want it higher
because<00:03:08.160> what<00:03:08.460> I've<00:03:08.580> noticed<00:03:08.760> is<00:03:09.000> that<00:03:09.060> it

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
because what I've noticed is that it

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.090 
because what I've noticed is that it
actually<00:03:09.480> does<00:03:09.780> sound<00:03:09.960> better<00:03:10.200> when<00:03:10.950> is

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
actually does sound better when is

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.680 
actually does sound better when is
higher<00:03:11.340> instead<00:03:11.850> of<00:03:11.970> perfectly<00:03:12.450> in<00:03:12.600> the

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
higher instead of perfectly in the

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.110 
higher instead of perfectly in the
middle<00:03:12.990> because<00:03:13.530> sound<00:03:14.040> waves<00:03:14.340> tend<00:03:14.640> to<00:03:14.790> go<00:03:14.910> up

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
middle because sound waves tend to go up

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.910 
middle because sound waves tend to go up
and<00:03:15.360> they<00:03:15.570> they<00:03:16.290> go<00:03:16.470> higher<00:03:16.710> than<00:03:16.740> lower<00:03:17.870> so

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
and they they go higher than lower so

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.100 
and they they go higher than lower so
that's<00:03:19.920> just<00:03:20.010> my<00:03:20.310> quick<00:03:20.940> review<00:03:20.970> just<00:03:21.540> to<00:03:21.630> let
