00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.889
 Hello guys with you and it is not firm 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.500
 heading wot fan 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:20.340
 and in this video you will see how you can 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:23.910
 take kolobanova with such a step 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.820
 as we as we see yes this is how much 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.160
 three dozen is a bunch of nines are those 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.179
 tanks that are just not 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.300
 succumb to 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.950
 a gun that a bulldog has 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.559
 until succumbs but this if you call u 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.600
 fix there astern well and so on and 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.520
 again this art 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.110
 why threw our hero so soon 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.399
 all due to the fact that he is still in 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:49.860
 cocked with 212 arty 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:53.610
 212a maybe because of this 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.649
 Well, you know how our hero will not 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.050
 how will our hero be carried away 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.899
 this fight where he won't go to him forever 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.500
 come across such tyazh who well, just 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:06.869
 unreal will pierce however not 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.030
 Corr price for it is only a plus 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.790
 because that's exactly because of this because 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.830
 the fact that in those places where he will go to him 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:18.479
 he won't be able to do anything there 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:20.820
 go the names of which I do 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.390
 this is a real video let's see 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.240
 how it was all so wakashka we see 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.880
 here in the gut of him of course not 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.460
 is subject to therefore he is decided from here 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.369
 leave 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:39.090
 then shoot a couple of art for good luck 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:41.610
 our hero is not hooked and here now 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.250
 the center goes a fierce shootout and 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.590
 meanwhile, our hero is trying to drive 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.479
 to another place maybe someone will be there 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.079
 back to him to stand and he will cause at least 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.509
 there is no damage here st-1 blue 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.640
 even enter gold shells well 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.560
 simply unrealistic and sasha take therefore 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.880
 of course, only one remains 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.920
 slip away from here and where faster and so 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.250
 poke it around here 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.319
 Esteshka leaves and criticizes him immediately 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.020
 engine of course to our hero 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.720
 remain only and repair and go 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.450
 from here to hell because he is there 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.870
 there will be no tenant as we see only 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.599
 once and c-stupa stupid and already at 425 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:28.790
 Hepe is 50 percent of our health 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:31.769
 tank and so here from 7 out of 7 it monitors 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.989
 he manages our hero to drive off somewhere 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.799
 so that everyone does not hit him at this time 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:39.750
 bummed out 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:41.549
 art on our hero, he survived here as 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.910
 we still see him all 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:46.799
 the damage was not inflicted by the allies simply 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.709
 how I do not know who is like broken glass 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:52.739
 really just blown apart will see 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.640
 in the center they have pierced our enemy 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.910
 all broke 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:00.750
 on the first line of a haircut proshilis in 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.739
 Sect still soul 38 in our favor in this 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.790
 time is our hero 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:08.130
 for hollowed one flash drive horde principle this 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.609
 his vocation is still yes or shine 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:14.100
 come to the rear 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:17.100
 rival and inflict damage even arts 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.410
 at least arte because as we again I 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.620
 again tyazh such that very hard 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.299
 will punch yes and in principle it is not 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.609
 need better of course highlight but 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:28.799
 again on this map you are not particularly 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:33.090
 highlight because there are so many 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:35.370
 mountains a lot of houses there just orton 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.690
 or will not reach or will be just 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:41.730
 many blunders 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:43.680
 there are already 412 guys here we see stitches 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.900
 the enemy stopped at our base but not 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:49.410
 began to take most likely someone there 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.810
 They wrote this motto that the capture of the base 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.360
 well well for killing her all the tanks give 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.459
 more experience is just not the case 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.970
 because if they were to capture 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:02.360
 maybe it was all different as we see 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.200
 two brother-acrobat becomes on base and 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.079
 starts to take base 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:10.290
 It remains only 30 seconds cords 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:12.930
 11 enemy tanks guys 11 tanks 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.150
 Our hero only 605 homework on 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.729
 trail chat so miser and what is now 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.530
 it happens it will just have to be the most 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:22.019
 big ones and which i saw is real 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:25.440
 the very kind of battle that took Kolobanova 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:27.930
 for my wounds the rarest and most 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:31.289
 cool rain see what remains 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.750
 9 seconds here we see 4502 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:37.139
 this leaves again no bulldog 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:39.450
 Vakashka missed him here 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:43.380
 with . from far too likely to see 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:45.060
 aim but no pony shoots and 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.990
 look take bulldog on 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:51.330
 the last second the base is already captured and with 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.729
 such moments that the base is already in capture 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:57.240
 Bulldog will now throw another bulldog 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:05:00.360
 the enemy but this will not be enough because 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.560
 that the base is already taken our hero is alive and time 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.820
 coming to the end 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:07.560
 you see here flies in as we see 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:11.370
 all the same flying projectile but 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:13.919
 no damage for our hero and he stays 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:17.550
 alive and the base is taken guys pay 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:19.610
 attention 11 tanks and enemies remain in 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.990
 alive and our hero 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.729
 as we in the beginning had no luck on him 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.310
 it turned out to really take the bun 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:28.750
 in such a way 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:30.580
 so this force is in principle 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:33.130
 merit rival because firstly 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:37.030
 they did not take the base that were here on 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:39.310
 our base stitches and those yarns that 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:41.440
 were in the center did not see that capture 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.120
 started there from the first seconds they should 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.280
 were still twirling back but nobody 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.850
 in principle, this is not done on time and for 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.680
 account of this is such a great fight 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:53.050
 just an epic probably kolobanov I don't 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.390
 I know maybe even somewhere to get out there on the 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:58.210
 official channel 

00:05:54.390 --> 00:06:00.880
 tanks FIG know but nevertheless lan u 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:03.610
 I probably first appeared and I hope 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.200
