 vegetable oil sunflower oil misses 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.680
 me now and let's see how it is then 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.020

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.119

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.930

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.939
 cut small 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.939
 now come away with the 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:11.010
 then we continue with the racing 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:14.130
 just occurred spontaneously as we 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:16.650
 somehow somehow so sound out of clay 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.710
 did and for the pattern 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:23.250
 sorry that I am machine that had to 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:27.660
 then you have so wissing sheet rolling pin 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.790
 flat planed so so and then easy 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.650
 about that 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.890
 that was cool, that's how you make the word 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.060
 Actually , well, it's all about now 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.770
 I already have a sick one here 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.870
 rausgeschnitten times now I at the 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.920
 the others this strunk if I now 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.350
 peel it 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.640
 I have just that in the case of 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:49.110
 other half also made and that 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:51.510
 tastes so sweet and delicious good I have 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:56.820
 which is now quite rough but is 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:03:03.860
 not much but this is really so 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:06.860
 that now then it's now probably fear 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.860
 marinate 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.570
 I hope the consistency fits so on 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.489
 the smell can already agree 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.890
 it smells bad this is now 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:23.190
 no smell eube there is a real smell 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.930
 mega delicious I would say that 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.670
 personell blender can do that as well 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.530
 I also have to beat the vitamins 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.780
 first thought but then I thought that 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.470
 fits in the big tube of the staff 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.250
 blender than from the part 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.970
 Now I just have to go through it 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:41.459
 Knead and then put on a tin of the 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.530
 I'll give that to the vending machines 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:45.780
 when eight are dried through 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.480
 I would like to be at school tomorrow 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:52.489
 take it to work 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.489
 So welcome a bit never 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:04:01.920
 what are probably on the onion 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:04.860
 sounds a bit mean but smell 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.120
 the smell is great I have now too 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.980
 I kneaded a bit more 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.720
 hope that's right but how should you 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.220
 otherwise 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:17.410
 i would like to eat you directly i 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:20.639
 love racing euro but before i die 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:25.000
 now it's just like they are 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:27.430
 go down cellar now because ours 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.350
 The place is in the basement as you can see 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.870
 I also have the dressing again 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:34.030
 pulled through with the stock market sheet because it 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.430
 mega delicious so I have it 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.650
 thought hey what never looked so tasty should 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.400
 That can not be necessary 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.190
 try out 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:45.070
 I'm already totally excited I 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.539
 now have two plates stocked in 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.160
 The shelter station is a bit 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:49.479
 brighter 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.039
 here it is other sheet metal have me 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:52.300
 endeavor to distribute them so that they 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:54.639
 do not overlap if possible 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.639
 We look at the occasion 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:05:00.010
 Just what the tomatoes are doing 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:01.900
 from the first round in the moment like that 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:04.289
 out and out of the second one sees there 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:07.120
 behind there are already the first 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:09.120
 and the crabs already looks quite 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.430
 Nice to go back to voting 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:15.660
 We are packing the two in the Danube now 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:23.560
 that is the part that we have 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:26.800
 okay I was missing hand we have one 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:29.010
 snacking a bit but that's a lot 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:32.490
 not when it is dry 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:32.490
 but delicious 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:42.920
 these are the chips and they are 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:45.280
 so very dry I do it all 

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.280
 gladly 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:58.389
 So they were in and out now 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:02.180
 free time I have turned it once 

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:04.400
 the taste visited suspiciously delicious 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.650
 at least we are the same 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:10.790
 pack away a few in one 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:14.870
 screw-on glass no matter who invented the recipe 

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:19.419
 or because the recipe was invented 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:24.979
 the child in any case, great thanks and 

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:27.850
 Praise and congratulations that's great in 

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:27.850
 eat 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:41.500
 why we are absolutely hit the 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:46.540
 are delicious they are crispy these 

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:48.100
 scarce we are definitely able to 

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:49.860
 keep up with chips 

00:06:48.100 --> 00:07:00.820
 So the normal potato chips 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:07:02.410
 potato be we are sooo delicious two 

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:04.660
 Apparel We may also have it 

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:07.120
 maybe a bigger savoy cabbage was done 

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:09.070
 a little less lemon than used 

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:11.100
 a little less since I think so 

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:13.140
 would take five or four grams 

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:15.520
 maybe five grams 

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:16.510
 But that's definitely the case now 

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:19.060
 more often to 1 

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:20.980
 You can also do that, I think that can 

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:23.770
 you are not vegan or not 

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:27.520
 high s plan for putting and impression 

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:30.070
 I agree with that 

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:31.480
 You can of course, youtube-channel 

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:33.460
 subscribe for free 

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:35.470
 What goes on here in the garden vegetables post 

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:36.610
 we always try a few online 

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:38.710
 to present videos 

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:40.930
 Of course not everything always so much 

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:43.300
 because otherwise it would hinder 

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:44.800
 that means that comes gradually 

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:46.780
 if you have any ideas what we have 

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:48.060
 would like to see us may times 

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:50.200
 decision 

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:52.570
 and if you want to have a look 

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:55.060
 on the homepage to the vegans 

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:57.070
 every season there are more 

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:57.460
 pictures and recipes just have a look 

00:07:57.070 --> 00:08:00.930
 purely 

00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:00.930
 then I would be nice to you
