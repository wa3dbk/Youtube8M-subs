00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:11.880
 tells crowd that Marcelo'm alright 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:15.330
 doing more in the tori this time our 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.869
 body's head had his remake 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.340
 changed a lot but the passive you give 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.390
 a look lose money for who 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.580
 was around you astor but the 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.140
 The pines that you put them win 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.840
 together right? 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.969
 you can put up 3 now they are 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.380
 the attacks of clement that I go 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:40.290
 explain to sibs that I am completely 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:42.809
 now not shock and question skill 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.270
 where would you go you spread the most 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.510
 shots or leaving them more concentrated 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.520
 in the same place but the third kill 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.039
 also had a change 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.890
 now Grenadines goes faster is more 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:01:01.500
 hard to predict where you're walking 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:04.739
 They heard esq shot where is yours or if 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:08.760
 you improve one of your other skills 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:11.820
 on occasion for people it will change 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:16.470
 I know when you made your head that 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:19.290
 will be recorded in the circus 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.930
 it will be found in the larger circle but 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.660
 From here, you 'll send three 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.430
 Grenadines who will not be watching 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.620
 says that the professional in a large 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:35.050
 beginning merchandise gave 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:38.340
 I 'm going to use it, it 's a good time for you. 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.340
 you want 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:46.170
 she has no weight but a doll killing him 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.930
 I mean you keep in charge what I 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.020
 Did you see this ceiling while continuing to 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.660
 I do not think they are a god. 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:02:00.030
 what better if you want to play for 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:03.120
 tagging a guy spent with them that I 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.850
 had commented to put up to 3 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.910
 the difference is that now I show range 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:12.330
 her and even a white bar underneath 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:14.100
 what would be the attack if she has or 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.250
 her touch right? 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.200
 and when that little white bar 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.110
 now he will give a shot that is worth every 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.959
 world and now when you're far from the 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:28.410
 its towers when it clicked bauab to end 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:30.570
 the races do not stop attacking now 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.880
 are forcing you to stay close to the 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:37.200
 tower but when you boot they end up 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:40.310
 to tell if your team and put the 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:44.200
 first champion you make a cannon 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:48.080
 much more powerful and he will not tell 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:52.340
 as the fourth left-hander will keep the 13 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:55.310
 invoice eight seconds but she has the 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:58.550
 line area and everything else ne 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:01.340
 there goes according to the occasion every hour 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.610
 You were a month, whatever you think 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.800
 but it matters not 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.900
 I came back with grenades and saw that 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.360
 she repeated three times that I think it is 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.600
 a good squirrel for when you want 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:17.209
 give too much control krall or want 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:20.299
 say when you want to help your 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:22.340
 time to amata galera at the time it goes 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:27.080
 can become a lot of people will 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:30.560
 come a lot of genres and when you 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:34.250
 another already on the doggie tv with his reach 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:36.830
 is slightly larger than normal dogs 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.380
 awarded none of the other three cups 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.730
 it only pain eight seconds but his damage 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.970
 It's very cool. 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:46.190
 there goes from creativity to knowing which 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:49.910
 time you will use sticks when I 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:52.670
 you the car won alone it always goes 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.890
 focus first on who you are cool 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.710
 not good for flip it's better 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:00.190
 produced 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:02.800
 look how the faces were well spread 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:06.010
 I prefer to use the dog for more 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.750
 easy to kill people I'll show them to 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.610
 you the little dog 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.400
 he has that white belly shall you 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:17.290
 When she's full of those little things that 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:20.110
 various creep all the enemy heroes and the 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.090
 anxious at the very last they win 

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:25.870
 big the same scheme 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:28.680
 logical that there is a much greater skill dana and 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:31.720
 everything else works the same way 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:35.470
 when I want to score an individual target 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:38.350
 I like it more and go back and use it in a row 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:42.139
 that what is today that was more will 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:45.439
 start there change in a short time 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:48.650
 your third skill I think this is what 

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:53.090
 to be more will have difficulty to hit 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:55.729
 which means that a short 70 diet provides the 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:58.580
 balance will make the way that he 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:05:01.189
 will pass and everything else you will have 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:03.800
 which will go a bit in advance 

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:07.099
 You really will one day touch me. 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:10.129
 attack the grenade get there the guy can 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:12.650
 install more and as I had commented 

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:15.529
 Before, it says that the guys are good. 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:18.680
 straight you can kill or two targets 

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:20.479
 easy is so dying the other to 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.300
 magic will continue to hit what 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:26.060
 is back there with a little practice and 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:29.270
 quick thinking did manage to play well 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:32.360
 I do not know, I hope you guys 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.669
 You liked the kingdom's tips there. 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.289
 dengue 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:37.699
 Click I like it if you have 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:40.069
 liked it, right? 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:43.069

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:44.319
 down to know that I can improve and 

00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:46.279
 everything else 

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:47.660
 thank you to everyone there who are 

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:50.240

 I'm going to stay here a hug and until
