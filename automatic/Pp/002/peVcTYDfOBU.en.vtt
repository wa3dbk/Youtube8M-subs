00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
the only way drinking gasoline is gonna

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.810 
the only way drinking gasoline is gonna
turn<00:00:39.840> you<00:00:39.989> into<00:00:40.140> an<00:00:40.320> alien<00:00:40.500> fighting<00:00:41.160> robot<00:00:41.610> is

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
turn you into an alien fighting robot is

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.130 
turn you into an alien fighting robot is
if<00:00:41.940> you<00:00:42.090> drink<00:00:42.360> enough<00:00:42.480> that<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:42.870> start

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
if you drink enough that you start

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.750 
if you drink enough that you start
tripping<00:00:43.530> out<00:00:43.649> really<00:00:43.890> bad<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:44.399> think

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
tripping out really bad and you think

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.880 
tripping out really bad and you think
you're<00:00:44.940> an<00:00:45.030> alien<00:00:45.210> fighting<00:00:45.899> robot<00:00:46.350> but<00:00:46.800> if

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
you're an alien fighting robot but if

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.260 
you're an alien fighting robot but if
you<00:00:46.980> drink<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.399> much<00:00:47.670> you're<00:00:47.820> probably<00:00:48.059> just

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
you drink that much you're probably just

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.029 
you drink that much you're probably just
gonna<00:00:48.510> die<00:00:48.809> I<00:00:49.230> guess<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.530> only<00:00:49.620> other<00:00:49.860> way<00:00:49.980> you

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
gonna die I guess the only other way you

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.860 
gonna die I guess the only other way you
could<00:00:50.250> turn<00:00:50.370> into<00:00:50.579> an<00:00:50.760> alien<00:00:50.910> fighting<00:00:51.480> robot

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
could turn into an alien fighting robot

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.930 
could turn into an alien fighting robot
is<00:00:52.079> if<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:52.710> killed<00:00:53.039> yourself<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.699> then<00:00:53.789> hope

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
is if you killed yourself and then hope

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.810 
is if you killed yourself and then hope
you<00:00:54.059> get<00:00:54.210> reincarnated<00:00:54.680> somehow<00:00:55.680> as<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:55.980> alien

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
you get reincarnated somehow as a alien

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.580 
you get reincarnated somehow as a alien
robot<00:00:57.360> but<00:00:57.750> I<00:00:57.780> don't<00:00:57.960> think<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:58.230> should<00:00:58.410> try

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
robot but I don't think you should try

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.229 
robot but I don't think you should try
that<00:00:58.859> because<00:00:58.949> I<00:00:59.129> could<00:00:59.340> be<00:00:59.370> risky<00:00:59.940> you<00:01:00.090> might

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
that because I could be risky you might

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.670 
that because I could be risky you might
kill<00:01:00.510> yourself<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.109> then<00:01:01.199> come<00:01:01.230> back<00:01:01.410> as

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
kill yourself and then come back as

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.520 
kill yourself and then come back as
something<00:01:01.829> lame<00:01:02.309> like<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:03.059> really<00:01:03.690> fat<00:01:04.260> ugly

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
something lame like a really fat ugly

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.260 
something lame like a really fat ugly
alien<00:01:05.220> on<00:01:05.369> Planet<00:01:05.939> fat-ass<00:01:06.479> or<00:01:07.049> like<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.439> witch

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270

alien on Planet fat-ass or like a witch
that's<00:01:09.270> all<00:01:09.510> lonely<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.710> ugly<00:01:11.460> because

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
that's all lonely and ugly because

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.539 
that's all lonely and ugly because
nobody<00:01:12.390> knows<00:01:12.570> witches<00:01:13.140> exist<00:01:13.680> but<00:01:14.340> what<00:01:14.490> I

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
nobody knows witches exist but what I

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.219 
nobody knows witches exist but what I
don't<00:01:14.670> get<00:01:15.030> is<00:01:15.090> why<00:01:15.479> do<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:15.720> start<00:01:15.990> chugging

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
don't get is why do you start chugging

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.350 
don't get is why do you start chugging
gasoline<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.340> get<00:01:17.460> power<00:01:17.729> why<00:01:18.030> didn't<00:01:18.270> you

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
gasoline to get power why didn't you

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.149 
gasoline to get power why didn't you
just<00:01:18.570> start<00:01:18.810> taking<00:01:19.259> steroids<00:01:19.950> like

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
just start taking steroids like

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.550 
just start taking steroids like
everybody<00:01:20.759> else<00:01:21.030> that<00:01:21.420> wants<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.810> get<00:01:22.140> really

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
everybody else that wants to get really

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.950 
everybody else that wants to get really
strong<00:01:23.070> that's<00:01:23.610> got<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.090> be<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.330> easiest<00:01:24.750> way

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
strong that's got to be the easiest way

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.080 
strong that's got to be the easiest way
to<00:01:25.110> gain<00:01:25.439> power<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:26.310> I<00:01:26.430> think<00:01:26.460> it's<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:26.909> bit

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
to gain power and I think it's a bit

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.289 
to gain power and I think it's a bit
safer<00:01:27.689> than<00:01:27.900> chugging<00:01:28.770> gasoline<00:01:29.460> not<00:01:29.880> safer

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
safer than chugging gasoline not safer

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.090 
safer than chugging gasoline not safer
for<00:01:30.509> your<00:01:30.630> nuts<00:01:30.840> though<00:01:31.229> in<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.560> article<00:01:32.009> the
