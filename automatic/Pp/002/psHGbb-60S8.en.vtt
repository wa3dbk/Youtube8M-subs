00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
this is an unplowed snow probably about

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.780 
this is an unplowed snow probably about
a<00:00:34.200> good<00:00:34.680> I<00:00:35.780> don't<00:00:36.780> know<00:00:36.980> six<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.250> eight<00:00:38.430> inches

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
I'll actually come to a stop here and

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:51.170 
I'll actually come to a stop here and
open<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.289> door<00:00:46.879> so<00:00:47.879> you<00:00:48.000> can<00:00:48.059> see<00:00:50.000> see<00:00:51.000> the

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
snow it's uh it's pretty deep I don't

think I have anything to well I've got
my<00:00:57.149> Stephen<00:00:57.629> Hawking<00:00:58.050> book<00:00:58.230> here<00:00:58.850> to<00:00:59.850> measure

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
my Stephen Hawking book here to measure

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:07.520 
my Stephen Hawking book here to measure
the<00:01:00.329> snow<00:01:03.260> so<00:01:05.090> is<00:01:06.090> down<00:01:06.450> deeper<00:01:06.900> than<00:01:07.049> that<00:01:07.110> but

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
the snow so is down deeper than that but

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.890 
the snow so is down deeper than that but
it<00:01:07.700> least<00:01:08.700> comes<00:01:08.970> up<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.330> their<00:01:09.510> out<00:01:09.630> in<00:01:09.750> their

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
it least comes up to their out in their

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.800 
it least comes up to their out in their
six<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.409> eight<00:01:10.560> inches<00:01:10.590> of<00:01:10.979> snow<00:01:11.450> so<00:01:12.450> then<00:01:12.659> I'm

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
six to eight inches of snow so then I'm

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.770 
six to eight inches of snow so then I'm
stopped<00:01:13.260> here<00:01:13.939> right<00:01:14.939> in<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.180> middle<00:01:15.390> of<00:01:15.540> all

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
stopped here right in the middle of all

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.890 
stopped here right in the middle of all
of<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.909> we'll<00:01:17.909> just<00:01:18.299> come<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.689> nice

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
of it and we'll just come to a nice

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.350 
of it and we'll just come to a nice
gentle<00:01:19.439> start<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:21.140> it<00:01:22.140> just<00:01:22.409> bikes<00:01:23.360> bites

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
gentle start and it just bikes bites

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.140 
gentle start and it just bikes bites
right<00:01:24.630> in

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
right in

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.090 
right in
and<00:01:26.390> then<00:01:26.870> right<00:01:27.050> here<00:01:27.110> there's<00:01:27.590> been<00:01:27.830> some

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
and then right here there's been some

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.170 
and then right here there's been some
drifting<00:01:28.670> of<00:01:28.970> the<00:01:29.420> snow<00:01:29.720> going<00:01:30.110> on<00:01:31.150> but<00:01:32.150> uh

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
drifting of the snow going on but uh

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.590 
drifting of the snow going on but uh
yeah<00:01:32.930> this<00:01:33.170> car<00:01:33.980> is<00:01:34.220> has<00:01:34.700> definitely<00:01:35.240> been<00:01:35.450> one

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
yeah this car is has definitely been one

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.810 
yeah this car is has definitely been one
of<00:01:35.720> the<00:01:35.840> best<00:01:36.080> snow<00:01:36.590> cars<00:01:37.240> that<00:01:38.240> I've<00:01:38.390> ever<00:01:38.630> had

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
of the best snow cars that I've ever had

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.610 
of the best snow cars that I've ever had
and<00:01:40.820> here<00:01:41.090> it's<00:01:41.210> a<00:01:41.330> little<00:01:41.360> more<00:01:41.750> drifted<00:01:42.380> to

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:42.620 
and here it's a little more drifted to

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.450 
and here it's a little more drifted to
you<00:01:42.950> can<00:01:43.190> see<00:01:43.400> it's<00:01:43.580> up<00:01:43.790> pretty<00:01:44.090> high<00:01:44.210> I<00:01:45.460> guess

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
you can see it's up pretty high I guess

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:47.740 
you can see it's up pretty high I guess
whoever<00:01:46.820> was<00:01:47.030> going<00:01:47.360> through<00:01:47.540> here<00:01:47.720> before

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
whoever was going through here before

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.810 
whoever was going through here before
was<00:01:48.260> scraping<00:01:48.770> bottom<00:01:49.010> i'm<00:01:49.460> sure<00:01:49.640> i'm

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
was scraping bottom i'm sure i'm

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:56.020 
was scraping bottom i'm sure i'm
probably<00:01:50.120> doing<00:01:50.450> that<00:01:50.750> too<00:01:54.310> so<00:01:55.310> let's<00:01:55.610> see<00:01:55.910> if

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
probably doing that too so let's see if

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.570 
probably doing that too so let's see if
i<00:01:56.470> might<00:01:57.470> even<00:01:57.500> try<00:01:57.830> to<00:01:57.890> go<00:01:58.130> up<00:01:58.160> this<00:01:58.369> other

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
i might even try to go up this other

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.060 
i might even try to go up this other
hill<00:01:58.940> here<00:01:59.270> it's<00:01:59.450> even<00:01:59.780> a<00:01:59.840> little<00:01:59.990> bit<00:02:00.110> steeper

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.710 

go<00:02:04.070> around<00:02:04.369> where<00:02:04.640> they<00:02:04.790> were<00:02:04.850> trying<00:02:05.240> to<00:02:05.479> plow

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
go around where they were trying to plow

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.590 
go around where they were trying to plow
and<00:02:06.110> stuff<00:02:06.670> see<00:02:07.670> if<00:02:07.760> i<00:02:07.820> can<00:02:08.000> make<00:02:08.090> it<00:02:08.149> up<00:02:08.360> this

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
and stuff see if i can make it up this

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.220 
and stuff see if i can make it up this
one<00:02:09.850> right<00:02:10.850> now<00:02:11.060> i'm<00:02:11.270> in<00:02:11.300> the<00:02:11.600> other<00:02:11.750> tracks

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
one right now i'm in the other tracks

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:18.010 
one right now i'm in the other tracks
but<00:02:15.550> it's<00:02:16.550> just<00:02:16.940> more<00:02:17.209> like<00:02:17.420> there's<00:02:17.660> nothing

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
but it's just more like there's nothing

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.010 
but it's just more like there's nothing
to<00:02:18.230> it<00:02:18.440> is<00:02:18.500> pretty<00:02:18.920> steep<00:02:19.250> hill

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
to it is pretty steep hill

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.250 
to it is pretty steep hill
and<00:02:21.320> I'm<00:02:21.710> purposefully<00:02:22.310> going<00:02:22.580> right<00:02:22.790> in<00:02:22.940> the

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
and I'm purposefully going right in the

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.760 
and I'm purposefully going right in the
unplowed<00:02:24.260> park<00:02:25.810> now<00:02:26.810> we're<00:02:27.110> losing<00:02:27.530> a<00:02:27.590> little

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
unplowed park now we're losing a little

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.680 
unplowed park now we're losing a little
bit<00:02:27.950> of<00:02:28.070> traction<00:02:28.340> here<00:02:28.820> but<00:02:29.030> it's<00:02:29.390> still

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
bit of traction here but it's still

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.390 
bit of traction here but it's still
moving<00:02:32.290> we're<00:02:33.290> digging<00:02:33.680> in<00:02:33.770> pretty<00:02:34.010> good<00:02:34.100> now

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
moving we're digging in pretty good now

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.250 
moving we're digging in pretty good now
it's<00:02:34.580> the<00:02:34.700> snow<00:02:35.540> is<00:02:35.660> going<00:02:35.780> to<00:02:35.870> be<00:02:36.020> a<00:02:36.050> little
