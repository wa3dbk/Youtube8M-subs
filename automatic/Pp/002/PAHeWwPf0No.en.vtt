00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:18.720
 the story begins so i was watching 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.390
 the nike lute channel 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.869
 I had put to call in the hour of 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.170
 Uncle grandfather start I was 12 years old 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:31.349
 but I used to like Uncle Grandpa or even so 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:34.680
 It was when I arrived at 7 o'clock at night that I 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.320
 I was calling to watch Uncle grandfather I 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.489
 I was excited because it's Monday 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:46.250
 it was the day of a new episode of Uncle Grandma 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:49.829
 because the one that the one who the trailer 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.670
 turn a hamburger with the dog 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.140
 hot 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.160
 the six plus 7 and 6 1 the episode was 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.730
 cut 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:04.290
 strangely and thought it had been a 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.670
 attack here but it was when you see a new 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:11.180
 past episode 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:14.670
 his name was the station killer 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:17.520
 I was extremely shocked by the title 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:21.680
 and to make credit worse before 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:25.360
 start the episode did not appear 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:29.300
 good the episode begins with the trailer 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:31.820
 walking quietly the screen changes to 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.520
 the trailer room where it is judged 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.940
 watching your favorite show 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:41.479
 the scene stays ale for 15 seconds 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:48.950
 soon she switches to the bedroom door of the 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:53.440
 that love and then begin to listen can 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:55.940
 if there be several noises glass breaking 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:02:00.200
 and someone crying 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:03.200
 this cry was violently loud but the 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.660
 noise and the shattering glasses were low 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.560
 and you could hardly hear 1 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:13.100
 without the goose appears on the scene with a 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:16.310
 letter and a box of chocolates 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:20.360
 Then leave it on the carpet of Uncle's door. 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:23.090
 grandfather then without the goose leaves the scene and 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.820
 those noises and sounds of someone crying 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:29.260
 and then to 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:33.880
 then the camera focused on the house 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:37.480
 and in that box of chocolates for a minute 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:41.030
 Until the camera wakes up for the Lord God. 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:44.600
 back watching tv 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:48.080
 in this scene between today pizza where 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:53.000
 The second question asks the second time around. 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:59.270
 Uncle Grandpa then he asked you say 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:00.560

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.860

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.560

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:10.010

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:14.330
 genius then I've been to pizza picks up a bucket 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:18.080

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:31.100

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.209

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:38.090
 I wanted to change channels but something 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:41.270
 told to stay and finish watching the 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:44.600
 episode but also because I was strange 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.940
 it was because it was not the voice of the 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.610
 service 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:52.580
