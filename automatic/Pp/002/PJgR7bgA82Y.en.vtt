in the pokemon showdown we're go see

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.510 
in the pokemon showdown we're go see
that<00:00:57.989> Metagross<00:00:58.320> kind<00:00:58.590> of<00:00:58.649> has<00:00:58.770> one<00:00:59.100> main<00:00:59.309> way

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
that Metagross kind of has one main way

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.709 
that Metagross kind of has one main way
of<00:00:59.550> being<00:00:59.850> wrong<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.239> that's<00:01:00.359> going<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.600> be

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
of being wrong and that's going to be

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.689 
of being wrong and that's going to be
agility<00:01:00.989> july<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:01.770> seventy<00:01:02.100> speed<00:01:02.340> isn't

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
agility july that seventy speed isn't

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.539 
agility july that seventy speed isn't
too<00:01:02.820> bad<00:01:03.000> that<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.570> 130<00:01:04.140> defense<00:01:04.530> is<00:01:04.710> huge

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
too bad that the 130 defense is huge

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.370 
too bad that the 130 defense is huge
any<00:01:06.150> special<00:01:06.540> defense<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:06.900> still<00:01:07.020> really<00:01:07.260> good

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
any special defense is still really good

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.990 
any special defense is still really good
so<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.799> most<00:01:08.010> we<00:01:08.159> can<00:01:08.340> get<00:01:08.460> out<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.700> its<00:01:08.790> bulk

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
so the most we can get out of its bulk

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.820 
so the most we can get out of its bulk
the<00:01:09.330> better<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:10.110> we<00:01:10.200> just<00:01:10.380> have<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.560> high

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
the better and we just have a high

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.320 
the better and we just have a high
amount<00:01:10.890> of<00:01:11.100> attack<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.549> we're<00:01:11.729> good<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:11.939> go

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
amount of attack and we're good to go

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.149 
amount of attack and we're good to go
that<00:01:12.720> kind<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.049> just<00:01:13.170> shows<00:01:13.320> that<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.740> want<00:01:13.979> to

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.940 
setting up I just like having it at this
106<00:01:27.420> range<00:01:27.689> because<00:01:28.259> then<00:01:28.409> that<00:01:28.590> means<00:01:28.770> at

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
106 range because then that means at

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.620 
106 range because then that means at
level<00:01:29.250> 50<00:01:29.579> you're<00:01:29.970> going<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.240> be<00:01:30.329> able<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.509> out

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
level 50 you're going to be able to out

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.469 
level 50 you're going to be able to out
speed<00:01:30.960> base<00:01:31.380> 135<00:01:32.040> speed<00:01:32.340> Pokemon<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:33.030> then

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
speed base 135 speed Pokemon and then

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.370 
speed base 135 speed Pokemon and then
that's<00:01:33.630> going<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.810> be<00:01:33.869> really<00:01:34.049> nice<00:01:34.170> while

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
that's going to be really nice while

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.170 
that's going to be really nice while
also<00:01:34.560> giving<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.040> lot<00:01:35.189> of<00:01:35.250> durability<00:01:35.490> this

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
also giving you a lot of durability this

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.760 
also giving you a lot of durability this
means<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:36.570> after<00:01:36.720> using<00:01:36.990> agility<00:01:37.560> you're

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
means that after using agility you're

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.050 
means that after using agility you're
going<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.040> have<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.189> lot<00:01:38.340> of<00:01:38.460> health<00:01:38.610> left<00:01:38.850> and

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
going to have a lot of health left and

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.640 
going to have a lot of health left and
then<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:39.479> just<00:01:39.659> go<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:39.960> sweep<00:01:40.259> from<00:01:40.409> there

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
then you just go and sweep from there

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.910 
then you just go and sweep from there
that<00:01:40.829> meteor<00:01:41.159> mash<00:01:41.369> 90<00:01:42.090> base<00:01:42.270> power<00:01:42.530> life<00:01:43.530> orbs

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
that meteor mash 90 base power life orbs

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.460 
that meteor mash 90 base power life orbs
stab<00:01:44.250> boost<00:01:44.579> with<00:01:44.850> this<00:01:45.060> 135<00:01:45.780> attack<00:01:46.110> is<00:01:46.320> going

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
stab boost with this 135 attack is going

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.770 
stab boost with this 135 attack is going
to<00:01:46.560> be<00:01:46.680> ridiculous<00:01:47.460> same<00:01:48.329> for<00:01:48.509> Zen<00:01:48.630> headbutt

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
to be ridiculous same for Zen headbutt

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.350 
to be ridiculous same for Zen headbutt
now<00:01:49.140> they<00:01:49.350> do<00:01:49.409> have<00:01:49.680> 90<00:01:49.979> accuracy<00:01:50.460> each<00:01:50.610> not

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
now they do have 90 accuracy each not

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.510 
now they do have 90 accuracy each not
perfect<00:01:51.960> so<00:01:52.320> there<00:01:52.649> is<00:01:52.829> a<00:01:52.860> little<00:01:53.100> bit<00:01:53.280> risk

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
perfect so there is a little bit risk

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.190 
perfect so there is a little bit risk
there<00:01:53.759> but<00:01:53.909> it's<00:01:54.000> still<00:01:54.090> pretty<00:01:54.570> solid<00:01:54.840> pretty

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
there but it's still pretty solid pretty

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.139 
there but it's still pretty solid pretty
reliable<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.860> lot<00:01:56.189> of<00:01:56.280> damage<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:56.729> then<00:01:57.030> this

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
reliable a lot of damage and then this

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.700 
reliable a lot of damage and then this
last<00:01:57.360> move<00:01:57.630> is<00:01:57.869> kind<00:01:58.049> of<00:01:58.140> whatever<00:01:58.409> you<00:01:58.530> want

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
last move is kind of whatever you want

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.649 
last move is kind of whatever you want
it<00:01:58.799> to<00:01:58.829> be<00:01:59.009> you<00:01:59.399> can<00:01:59.460> put<00:01:59.640> earthquake<00:02:00.119> here<00:02:00.360> you

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
it to be you can put earthquake here you

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:01.969 
it to be you can put earthquake here you
can<00:02:00.780> put<00:02:00.899> ice<00:02:01.079> punch<00:02:01.350> here<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:01.619> can<00:02:01.740> pretty

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
can put ice punch here you can pretty

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.499 
can put ice punch here you can pretty

to cover for you can be really solid

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.490 
to cover for you can be really solid
with<00:02:05.820> or<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:06.450> can<00:02:06.479> just<00:02:06.750> go<00:02:06.960> what<00:02:07.200> for<00:02:07.380> what<00:02:07.469> I

don't have to take the risk with
your<00:04:26.069> mash<00:04:26.189> I<00:04:26.340> feel<00:04:26.550> that<00:04:26.789> a<00:04:26.819> tea<00:04:26.939> power<00:04:27.180> isn't

00:04:27.499 --> 00:04:27.509 
your mash I feel that a tea power isn't

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:28.429 
your mash I feel that a tea power isn't
really<00:04:27.780> going<00:04:27.870> to<00:04:27.930> be<00:04:28.020> too<00:04:28.139> much<00:04:28.259> of<00:04:28.349> a

00:04:28.429 --> 00:04:28.439 
really going to be too much of a

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:30.439 
really going to be too much of a
difference<00:04:28.680> from<00:04:28.770> 90<00:04:29.129> all<00:04:29.310> that<00:04:29.729> accuracy<00:04:30.150> and

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:30.449 
difference from 90 all that accuracy and

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:32.089 
difference from 90 all that accuracy and
a<00:04:30.569> chance<00:04:30.810> to<00:04:30.960> flinch<00:04:31.199> your<00:04:31.319> opponent<00:04:31.680> which

00:04:32.089 --> 00:04:32.099 
a chance to flinch your opponent which
