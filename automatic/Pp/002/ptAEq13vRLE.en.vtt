impact per possession than anyone who

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.770 
impact per possession than anyone who
plays<00:04:04.769> that<00:04:04.799> role<00:04:05.159> you<00:04:05.699> can<00:04:05.819> 50<00:04:06.120> games<00:04:06.329> time<00:04:06.629> he

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
plays that role you can 50 games time he

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.270 
plays that role you can 50 games time he
can<00:04:06.900> give<00:04:06.989> me<00:04:07.019> a<00:04:07.199> much<00:04:07.319> better<00:04:07.500> player<00:04:07.799> but<00:04:07.979> I'd

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
can give me a much better player but I'd

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.770 
can give me a much better player but I'd
take<00:04:08.519> him<00:04:08.669> right<00:04:08.849> now<00:04:09.000> you've<00:04:09.359> always<00:04:09.540> had<00:04:09.720> a

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
take him right now you've always had a

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.479 
take him right now you've always had a
knock<00:04:09.959> on<00:04:10.079> each<00:04:10.229> other<00:04:10.409> I<00:04:10.680> don't<00:04:10.799> think<00:04:11.010> we've

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
knock on each other I don't think we've

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:12.949 
knock on each other I don't think we've
guard<00:04:11.849> I<00:04:11.909> think<00:04:11.940> he<00:04:12.150> gets<00:04:12.269> the<00:04:12.449> ball<00:04:12.599> anywhere

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
guard I think he gets the ball anywhere

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.360 
guard I think he gets the ball anywhere
near<00:04:13.349> enough<00:04:13.560> your<00:04:13.799> question<00:04:14.190> is<00:04:14.280> all

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
near enough your question is all

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.159 
near enough your question is all
Australian<00:04:14.669> nomination<00:04:15.329> must<00:04:15.449> you<00:04:15.629> yep<00:04:15.959> your

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
Australian nomination must you yep your

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:23.029 
Australian nomination must you yep your
question<00:04:16.590> Australian<00:04:17.549> I<00:04:17.699> think<00:04:21.440> of<00:04:22.440> course<00:04:22.740> is

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039 
question Australian I think of course is

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:24.500 
question Australian I think of course is
yet<00:04:23.250> probably<00:04:23.940> the<00:04:24.000> best<00:04:24.120> workman<00:04:24.419> in<00:04:24.479> the

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
yet probably the best workman in the

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.839 
yet probably the best workman in the
last<00:04:24.659> 25<00:04:25.080> years<00:04:25.110> think<00:04:25.590> so<00:04:25.950> that<00:04:26.310> would<00:04:26.520> be

00:04:26.839 --> 00:04:26.849 
last 25 years think so that would be

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:27.950 
last 25 years think so that would be
fairly<00:04:27.180> obvious<00:04:27.270> that

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
fairly obvious that

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.530 
fairly obvious that
so<00:04:28.960> they<00:04:29.590> both<00:04:29.770> in<00:04:29.950> the<00:04:30.010> same<00:04:30.220> team<00:04:30.790> sometimes

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
so they both in the same team sometimes

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.120 
so they both in the same team sometimes
it<00:04:31.720> is<00:04:31.840> just<00:04:31.870> amount<00:04:32.320> of<00:04:32.440> time<00:04:32.590> played<00:04:32.890> in<00:04:33.070> a

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
it is just amount of time played in a

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.520 
it is just amount of time played in a
certain<00:04:33.310> role<00:04:34.080> makes<00:04:35.080> a<00:04:35.200> massive<00:04:35.380> difference

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
certain role makes a massive difference

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:36.960 
certain role makes a massive difference
to<00:04:35.980> your<00:04:36.040> overall<00:04:36.280> numbers<00:04:36.580> if<00:04:36.670> you<00:04:36.730> break

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
to your overall numbers if you break

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:38.580 
to your overall numbers if you break
them<00:04:37.150> down<00:04:37.210> here<00:04:37.600> look<00:04:37.720> below<00:04:37.960> just<00:04:38.230> one<00:04:38.410> sheet

of paper a little bit of research a
little<00:04:41.260> bit<00:04:54.450> on<00:04:55.450> a<00:04:55.630> bright<00:04:55.870> cheek<00:04:56.350> you<00:04:56.830> know

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:13.620 

let's<00:05:09.100> see<00:05:09.250> if<00:05:09.310> he<00:05:09.460> takes<00:05:09.700> 20<00:05:12.360> want<00:05:13.360> to<00:05:13.450> just

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
let's see if he takes 20 want to just

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.660 
let's see if he takes 20 want to just
see<00:05:13.810> him<00:05:14.140> at<00:05:14.800> the<00:05:15.040> end<00:05:15.160> of<00:05:15.220> the<00:05:15.280> game<00:05:15.430> let's

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:15.670 
see him at the end of the game let's

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:17.070 
see him at the end of the game let's
look<00:05:15.880> at<00:05:16.000> his<00:05:16.090> impact<00:05:16.390> I<00:05:16.600> want<00:05:16.780> you<00:05:16.840> to<00:05:16.900> look<00:05:16.960> at

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
look at his impact I want you to look at

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.930 
look at his impact I want you to look at
is<00:05:17.170> 14<00:05:17.470> or<00:05:17.500> 15<00:05:17.920> which<00:05:18.100> will<00:05:18.220> probably<00:05:18.520> get<00:05:18.670> and

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
is 14 or 15 which will probably get and

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:24.470 
is 14 or 15 which will probably get and
see<00:05:19.090> what<00:05:19.390> impact<00:05:19.660> you<00:05:20.730> deepen<00:05:21.730> the<00:05:21.880> take

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:24.480 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.190 

because<00:05:26.280> his<00:05:27.280> most<00:05:27.580> experienced<00:05:28.120> day<00:05:28.720> mayor

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.200 
because his most experienced day mayor

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:34.740 
because his most experienced day mayor
40<00:05:29.860> got<00:05:30.040> 12<00:05:30.340> team<00:05:30.580> not<00:05:30.730> 6<00:05:31.000> or<00:05:31.740> 12
