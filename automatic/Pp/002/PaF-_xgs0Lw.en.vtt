the future of poly ups leading ladies

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.109 
the future of poly ups leading ladies
seems<00:02:06.540> really<00:02:07.170> really<00:02:07.350> good

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
seems really really good

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.490 
seems really really good
the<00:02:10.119> only<00:02:10.420> thing<00:02:10.720> that<00:02:10.929> I<00:02:10.959> would<00:02:11.049> complain

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
the only thing that I would complain

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.309 
the only thing that I would complain
about<00:02:11.709> our<00:02:11.860> highway<00:02:12.489> is<00:02:12.700> that<00:02:12.970> after<00:02:13.780> like<00:02:14.200> the

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
about our highway is that after like the

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.729 
about our highway is that after like the
first<00:02:14.530> half<00:02:14.799> the<00:02:15.640> plot<00:02:16.540> of<00:02:16.720> the<00:02:16.840> movie<00:02:16.870> seems

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
first half the plot of the movie seems

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.530 
first half the plot of the movie seems
pretty<00:02:18.129> predictable<00:02:18.549> even<00:02:19.269> though<00:02:19.420> the

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
pretty predictable even though the

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.020 
pretty predictable even though the
climax<00:02:20.049> is<00:02:20.319> pretty<00:02:21.220> different<00:02:21.459> from<00:02:21.819> your

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
climax is pretty different from your

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.410 
climax is pretty different from your
average<00:02:22.150> Bollywood<00:02:22.810> movie<00:02:23.250> also<00:02:24.250> the<00:02:24.819> long

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
average Bollywood movie also the long

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.930 
average Bollywood movie also the long
silences<00:02:26.230> and<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:26.650> lack<00:02:26.860> of<00:02:26.890> notch<00:02:27.400> camera<00:02:27.849> in

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
silences and the lack of notch camera in

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.910 
silences and the lack of notch camera in
the<00:02:28.060> movie<00:02:28.420> will<00:02:28.750> turn<00:02:29.140> away<00:02:29.319> the<00:02:29.590> single

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
the movie will turn away the single

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.949 
the movie will turn away the single
screen<00:02:30.190> audience<00:02:30.579> so<00:02:30.790> business-wise<00:02:31.510> there's

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
screen audience so business-wise there's

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:32.670 
screen audience so business-wise there's
the<00:02:32.140> race

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
the race

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.539 
the race
otherwise<00:02:33.579> the<00:02:34.510> movie<00:02:34.810> is<00:02:34.989> really<00:02:35.319> good

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:41.280 

now<00:02:39.549> India's<00:02:40.000> Allah's<00:02:40.299> highway<00:02:40.840> is<00:02:41.049> neither

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
now India's Allah's highway is neither

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.130 
now India's Allah's highway is neither
your<00:02:41.680> average<00:02:42.579> love<00:02:42.879> story<00:02:43.209> nor<00:02:43.659> your<00:02:43.900> typical

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
your average love story nor your typical

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.369 
your average love story nor your typical
Road<00:02:44.650> movie<00:02:44.920> it<00:02:45.519> is<00:02:45.730> different<00:02:46.450> three<00:02:47.200> and<00:02:47.319> a
