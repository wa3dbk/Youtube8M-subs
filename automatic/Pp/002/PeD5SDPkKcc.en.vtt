00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:08.880
 hello for nail decoration now 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.920
 there are so many specials for sale 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.559
 fixtures basically this 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.280
 all kinds of flat stickers of various 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.430
 colors 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.460
 but there are also bulk plates that are very 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.279
 well suited for a wedding manicure 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.640
 Today I specifically chose to design 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:29.039
 tea roses and very small flowers 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.219
 the little ones are made very neatly and 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:36.239
 also here look nice on nails and 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:39.149
 i will show you 2 ways of fixing flowers 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.670
 The first way is to mount a flower with and 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.610
 assistance and wing first needed 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.120
 lay out all the artificial on 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:51.649
 to points gash it 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:54.570
 for wedding manicure most often 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:57.000
 do a french manicure so here I am 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.550
 prepared as you see on ko. 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.730
 lay out topilin and show now how i am 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.010
 I will lay out on it flowers 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:07.439
 squeeze the monomer thoroughly 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.770
 and dial a small acrylic bead 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:15.330
 powder i use clear acrylic 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.770
 powder put a ball of acrylic where I have 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.810
 will be located 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.020
 you have to take the first flower then 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.040
 flower 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:31.369
 selected color and neatly using 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.369
 tweezers soot it on an acre 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.409
 such as stand for 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.020
 few seconds 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:42.020
 try to remove before polymerization 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:45.109
 not dried up yet 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:49.009
 acrylic so that you do not have around roses 

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:54.709
 extra volume next rosette 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:55.899
 side by side also put a balloon like revan I 

00:01:54.709 --> 00:02:02.350
 now take 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:10.750
 little white flower wreath soot in the center and 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:14.709
 holding another ball 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.709
 one more flower 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.540
 and so on 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:43.689
 after you have attached all 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:46.810
 little flowers , check carefully whether 

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:48.760
 they stuck with you and then 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.129
 finished work we will be neat 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.640
 overlap top top cover 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:58.470
 I for example use a top from gel varnishes 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.010
 top coat first will give 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.230
 glossy shine 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.709
 yours was washed down to us but not 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:09.329
 polished on to dot and second 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:13.329
 will give more clutch 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:14.319
 flowers with a nail pass around 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:17.409
 flower 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:19.019
 do not need much flooding flowers to 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:24.299
 you failed 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:28.299
 ugly volume and shapeless colors 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:30.569
 just slightly can be almost dry 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:35.290
 brush wrung out 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:38.099
 a little bit to put the center of the flowers on 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:43.090
 petals for them too 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:47.260
 got such a nice shine 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:50.590
 after polymerization, carefully remove 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.709
 sticky dispersion layer best 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.930
 for this use 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:58.090
 napkin lint-free otherwise on 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:01.870
 flowers may remain numerous 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:05.290
 villi and another way in which 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:08.859
 you can attach flowers and covered 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:12.280
 nails just ordinary gel varnish after 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:15.669
 the polymerization of the top coating I take off 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:19.900
 sticky layer then put 

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:22.000
 a bit of glue can be several 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.340
 drops and put in those places where you 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.340
 will have 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.340
 flowers 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:34.760
 split i use for tips and now 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.760
 also with tweezers 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:40.790
 I begin to gently attach our 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.790
 plastic flowers 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:53.250
 after all of you flowers 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.970
 you have attached a few more seconds 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:05:00.960
 you can move them to arrange as you 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:04.800
 need to wait a few more seconds 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:07.560
 when the glue is already dry and just like when 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:11.550
 acrylic modeling will block 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:15.150
 all on to points and neat 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:18.470
 around florets top cover for 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:24.150
 gel polish you and after polymerization 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:26.150
 remove the sticky dispersion layer stay 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:29.040
 such flowers can be with 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:32.400
 cutting and then remove the coating by 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:35.670
 technology if you used your 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:38.730
 work like i acrylic and gel varnish then 

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:40.980
 unfold with liquid to 

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:43.530
 Acrylic and gel polish removers 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:45.960
 if you use gel 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:48.810
 suppose no maceration then you 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:06:01.170
 all the material will need to be completely asleep 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:06:03.810
 I hope you all need this 

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:06.980
 questions the capital signed all big 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.980
 Thank you for your attention and
