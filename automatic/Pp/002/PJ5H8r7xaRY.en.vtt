00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:08.670
 alone here at home but I think you can 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:18.380
 people to have an idea is at stake 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:18.380
 on this issue my wife's support there 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:25.560
 This is going to be the truth and for July 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:31.700

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.700
 all very angry 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:51.679
 and I swear like that it will be better than 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:59.390
 imagined 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:02:02.319
 I'm a crazy guy talking about it here. 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:09.340
 it's a powder 

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:13.459
 he talks and moves that down the scale 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:18.140
 should be about 20 centimeters 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:22.690
 the most andrÃ© super middle that has a button 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:24.860
 which defines the practice of a latex rubber 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:28.849
 I was reading a website, can you? 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.560

00:03:33.939 --> 00:04:03.250
 button that was to tighten and it goes 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:04:04.989
