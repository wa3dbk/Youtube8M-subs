00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.540
 Hello, today's my video shot 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.639
 for one of my subscribers I decided 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.660
 it’s better to show it once 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.340
 a hundred times to write in skype i want 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.410
 tell about those plan washers which 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.840
 I use on my 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:22.859
 lathe grinding machine all faceplates 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.100
 I have homemade starting from here 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.960
 here 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.840
 metal is generally a subject 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:34.290
 pride i saw a few years ago 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:37.590
 specially under hard work here 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.590
 plate six horses welded sleeve 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.460
 then it's all from a single install growing 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.399
 on in the middle attacked milled 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:51.570
 if the hole without thread is threaded 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:54.899
 but let's say this is the most sophisticated 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.789
 the rest I have a much easier and 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.149
 I've got a plan that's washers of this type 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:05.339
 plywood disc of tens again 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:10.740
 welded flange disc mounted on four 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:13.280
 cog m4 there is such a sticky tape 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:18.479
 on sandpaper 125 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:21.950
 similarly and by the way 150 sticky I 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:25.710
 I buy in stores that sell 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:28.619
 sewing materials there is wide 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.360
 50 millimeters velcro glued 88 for 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.670
 nano red and keeps very well and 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.520
 this circle works constantly here for me 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.890
 the most running 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.170
 Well, such flanges are certainly comfortable but 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:45.119
 you need to make them fool around 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:49.619
 lathe and this is the one 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:52.310
 My first faceplate was doing for years 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.680
 twenty back and gray it works 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.899
 119 diameter means here used 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.340
 plywood 6 millimeters but it is not enough 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.340
 at least 10 millimeters 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:08.000
 used for fixing a piece 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:15.440
 bakelite plywood means its diameter 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:20.280
 about 50 millimeters and height 30 32 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:23.880
 it means the screw on m5 serves simultaneously and 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.010
 key and clamp as i did i took 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:30.209
 this piece of plywood drilled holes 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:32.940
 14 drilled and cut threads M5 all 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:35.489
 it installed on the machine and from the end of the shaft 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.430
 cutter and in the middle did a small 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:40.380
 on the bottom of the friction that is fit is 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:44.459
 right edge literally millimeters 5 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:51.560
 after i danced i put 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:53.160
 drive and three screws screwed to this 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.660
 a piece of plywood 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.260
 Well, after that I’m already talking a little 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.690
 polished 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:05.850
 and stuck on wait here is another option 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:09.390
 similar faceplate too or this 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.840
 I am plywood but here I fell through 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.459
 thread 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.950
 so I had to do this 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:19.350
 metal plate construction 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.209
 cut a pass way by the cut 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.390
 jigsaw plywood was pretty easy 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:26.940
 M5 thread is cut in the plate and from here 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:32.420
 rolls that are clamped into the keyway 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:34.850
 Well, also three three screws m5 too 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.019
 since there is a small diameter 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.709
 enough 12 millimeters then this 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:41.220
 faceplate 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:44.670
 I assembled as is installed on the machine and 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.769
 only then he danced but the big one 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.350
 faceplate done quite recently she 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:52.560
 made precisely under the sandpaper gi diameter 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:58.829
 not 250 millimeters anymore I think 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:04:01.160
 do irrational because the average 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:03.780
 part of the faceplate practically does not work 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:07.440
 I use the faceplate on the machine with 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:09.720
 Turns in one and a half thousand so here 250 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:13.199
 this is probably the critical diameter if 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.880
 do 300 then the edges of sandpaper will 

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:18.320
 faster wear and 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.920
 and let's say when face grinding 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.820
 once rf street 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:26.970
 like this the bar on the wait will already be under 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.650
 watering and among it will work 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.390
 better to make less diameter 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.130
 but if you need something big 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:36.750
 handle then for this if tape 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:37.410
 the machine means the flange itself is made of 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:43.970
 two sheets 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:45.120
 mdf in total they give 40 millimeters and 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:49.760
 diameter 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:54.200
 I'm 85 millimeters 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:57.600
 it means the faceplate is fixed on 4 screws 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:05:00.330
 ordinary drywall 45 screws but with 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:04.280
 this side she pulls at gluing 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:08.400
 several and there are two screws for one screw 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:10.530
 m6 with an internal hexagon why 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:14.250
 just because when she 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:20.130
 set by the machine with such a key and such 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:24.240
 screw 1 is more convenient to tighten this means 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:27.060
 I screw the screw in the furniture nut 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:30.630
 they will all twist I will show 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:32.850
 so here's the type of nut she has 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:38.940
 hexagon which allows you to screw 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:41.510
 and on the other hand i made a key 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:45.150
 the key is made of furniture 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:50.460
 which is just circumcised and cleaned on it 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:52.770
 part of the helix is ​​just the width of the key 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:56.730
 the groove corresponds to the confirme of 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:58.860
 4 millimeters per rus and here are small 

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:02.970
 therefore, such an attachment is quite 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:06.660
 well enough it was done the same way 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:08.850
 At first this part was glued together. 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:11.940
 put on the machine danced to do 

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:15.030
 on the bottom friction and only after that 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:19.810
 glued and screw the faceplate itself 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:24.190
 the disk itself 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:25.260
 Here on this perhaps all thanks to all 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:27.910
 for your attention 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:30.810
 rate the video subscribe put 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:30.810
