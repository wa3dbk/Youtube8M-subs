looser<00:00:28.080> I<00:00:28.380> suggest<00:00:28.740> getting<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:29.039> solid<00:00:29.369> color

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
looser I suggest getting a solid color

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.189 
looser I suggest getting a solid color
like<00:00:29.759> black<00:00:30.060> so<00:00:30.269> it's<00:00:30.390> easier<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:30.750> paint<00:00:31.019> on

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
like black so it's easier to paint on

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.050 
like black so it's easier to paint on
next<00:00:31.920> you<00:00:32.009> need<00:00:32.130> to<00:00:32.189> decide<00:00:32.550> on<00:00:32.700> your<00:00:32.730> pattern

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:33.060

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.030 
next you need to decide on your pattern
