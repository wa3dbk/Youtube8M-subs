00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:10.410
 hello welcome to photokina we are 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.200
 today on the nikon stand and we 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.480
 will introduce you to the 750's so that's 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.000
 a little the successor of the 17 year old 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.380
 a lot is waiting for it what is it 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.619
 we will find an oratory 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.600
 naturally a full format sensor 24 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.980
 megapixels so a little less than the collar 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.840
 of the bussang all say that it can 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.359
 always delight those who did not want 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.309
 have so many definitions at the level of 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.190
 case one is a pretty build 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.260
 compact very light we have a facade 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.520
 before carbon fiber and the rest of the 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:45.660
 magnesium alloy frame 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:48.989
 what about more we have a viewfinder 100% on 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.250
 has a grapel lcd screen we had a 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.670
 ergonomics that is closer to that 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:58.829
 the d610 rather than the 810 with here 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:01.670
 lockable wheel at the level of the 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:05.220
 novelty is especially the lcd screen 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.950
 mounted on double hinge that commits 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.090
 so to orient the screen what will be very 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.090
 practice in video 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.710
 this is unfortunately it is not 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.240
 high level touch again 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.650
 news we will especially remember the wifi 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.250
 inside so we're saying a 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.930
 24 36 24 million pixel sensor 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.340
 supported by an x pitt cade so the same 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.130
 we find in time the models 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.229
 high-end d 810 of the 4 s we will 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.080
 can reach a gust of 6.5 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:43.710
 imachin per second and we will have a video 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:45.360
 hdtv 1080 50 25 24 frames per second in 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.950
 solid images at the level of the 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:54.690
 connectivity we will have classically 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:56.750
 socket headphone jack micro usb hdmi so 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.950
 classic enough we'll have the other side 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.159
 double fleet then this case will be 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.479
 available 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:03.280
 at the end of September for 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.409
 about 2200 euros so it is intercalated 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.470
 really in between six years old she says 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:10.420
 d 810 and that's so we have both a 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:14.530
 lightweight case a little more muscular than the 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.700
 d610 much less pixelated than 2,810 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.110
 this is a case that should 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.400
 find a little place 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.640
 we are reproached for it is 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.340
 maybe a little too d610 oriented 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.349
 would have liked maybe a little more 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.170
 burst for example on a housing 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:29.739
 like that but we're going to see them jean 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.000
 of gastines 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.000
 we asked him a few questions
