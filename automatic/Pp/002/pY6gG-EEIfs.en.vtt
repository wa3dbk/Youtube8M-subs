00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.720
 hello and welcome once again to the 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:08.570
 videos of your pastor in today's video 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:11.470
 We are going to show you how to reset your 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:14.680
 finished factory configuration 

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:16.810
 this is true for both phones and 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:21.430
 for tablets that 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:24.340
 have the android operating system 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:27.640
 how good we go there we will use as 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.510
 example this tablet of 10 with some 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.650
 inches 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.650
 a very nice design 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:41.470
 the tablet is a very finished 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:43.550
 here we have the buttons on the 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.850
 volume control 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:51.020
 this would be the hdmi audio plug and the 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:53.780
 memory card and USB port 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:56.430
 current input 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.010
 here we saw the 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.670
 bed 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.670
 good 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:08.140
 it is still always good direct from 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:10.300
 factory have all the plastics of 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.320
 protection 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.320
 we are going to 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.660
 to open it and good 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.660
 we're 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:27.560
 main menu and we would be interested to 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:31.940
 reset go 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.940
 applications and go to settings 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:39.060
 to show you for those that country 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.930
 the settings icon 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:47.090
 we would apply and we would go 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.090
 to an option that is backup 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.830
 backup we would go to the option 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.170
 backup 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.710
 and there would be an option that could be reset 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:05.670
 factory data we would click and we 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.610
 would warn that everything would be deleted 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.590
 erase all applications 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.180
 all the settings all the data of the 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.490
 account 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:17.130
 we could select to erase 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:21.440
 also the whole sd card 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:24.230
 and click we would reset the table 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.090
 and we could confirmation message you 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:31.069
 we would give to erase everything 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.069
 the tablet would resist 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.470
 with this sometimes not 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.980
 they may present problems but 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.960
 generally if you reset all the 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.190
 factory settings are usually 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.319
 solve these problems 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.049
 It's usually like that 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.819
 according to the number of applications and 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:54.230
 data that you have on the tablet will take 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.230
 more or less in reset 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.769
 and just have a little patience 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:03.200
 remember that you will lose everything, that is to say 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:06.379
 all applications games photos 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.030
 music everything you have will be lost 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:10.730
 so it's good if you make a copy of 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:14.349
 security of all that data before 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.349
 reset to factory settings 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.099
 good 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.569
 it's useful as I say for the best it's a 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:23.100
 small problem that does not work well a 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:25.290
 button 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.540
 or an application seems to hang and not 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.070
 You know very well how to fix it 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.140
 the first option to always contemplate 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.950
 to reset the tablet of the 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.950
 factory configuration 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:43.319
 good keep thinking 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.319
 now it's just going on 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:49.050
 having reset it now they are 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:51.180
 reconfiguring of all the data already 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.629
 they must be erased because there was hardly 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.629
 nothing 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.780
 and it's good to be able to have fun 

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:01.780
 turn on in German 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:09.340
 we get everything like the tutorial and such and 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:12.790
 it's factory again 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:16.379
 and good to change you see it again from 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.379
 tutorial message and so on 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.019
 never see the espanyol 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.690
 and it is already 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:36.060
 well so I 've seen that it's really 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:39.230
 easy factory reset this is one of 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.210
 the advantages of android 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:43.670
 think like that to make it easy 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:46.160
 restore phones and solve 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:49.190
 any kind of technical problem that 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.230
 you can have good agreement I hope that 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.330
