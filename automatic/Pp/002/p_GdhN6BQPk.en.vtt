00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
balance it like that so we're not

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.510 
balance it like that so we're not
balancing<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:20.909> is<00:01:21.270> right<00:01:21.720> here<00:01:22.080> so<00:01:22.520> like

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
you're like the fingers start so right

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.730 
you're like the fingers start so right
here<00:01:28.820> or<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:30.240> could<00:01:30.450> do<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:30.720> right<00:01:30.750> here<00:01:31.259> but<00:01:31.530> I

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
here or you could do it right here but I

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.030 
here or you could do it right here but I
prefer<00:01:32.310> right<00:01:32.520> here<00:01:32.970> cuz<00:01:33.960> that's<00:01:34.680> where<00:01:34.860> your

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
prefer right here cuz that's where your

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:47.600 
prefer right here cuz that's where your
fingers<00:01:35.430> are<00:01:35.549> kinda<00:01:41.899> stops<00:01:46.250> once<00:01:47.250> you're<00:01:47.430> done

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
fingers are kinda stops once you're done

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:54.219 
fingers are kinda stops once you're done
put<00:01:48.479> all<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:49.439> down<00:01:51.350> time<00:01:52.350> we<00:01:52.530> step<00:01:52.920> up

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
put all that down time we step up

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.530 
put all that down time we step up
actually<00:01:55.229> spin<00:01:55.619> on<00:01:55.770> your<00:01:55.890> finger<00:01:56.509> so<00:01:57.509> you

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
actually spin on your finger so you

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.100 
actually spin on your finger so you
gonna<00:01:58.020> do

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
gonna do

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:09.460 
gonna do
they're<00:02:00.110> really<00:02:00.350> good<00:02:00.590> spin<00:02:01.090> positive<00:02:07.569> and<00:02:08.569> if

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
they're really good spin positive and if

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.309 
they're really good spin positive and if
you<00:02:10.190> do<00:02:10.310> it<00:02:10.429> like<00:02:10.580> this<00:02:10.959> it<00:02:11.959> doesn't<00:02:12.200> work<00:02:12.620> like

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
you do it like this it doesn't work like

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.770 
you do it like this it doesn't work like
move<00:02:15.319> first<00:02:15.560> you<00:02:15.769> gotta<00:02:15.980> throw<00:02:16.760> it<00:02:16.880> up<00:02:17.090> gotta

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
move first you gotta throw it up gotta

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.110 
move first you gotta throw it up gotta
find<00:02:18.140> the<00:02:19.099> middle<00:02:19.400> part

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
find the middle part

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.660 
find the middle part
so<00:02:20.390> I<00:02:20.750> mean<00:02:21.680> anywhere<00:02:22.220> it<00:02:22.310> could<00:02:22.400> be<00:02:22.550> the

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
so I mean anywhere it could be the

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.570 
so I mean anywhere it could be the
middle<00:02:23.290> it<00:02:24.290> doesn't<00:02:24.319> have<00:02:24.769> to<00:02:24.920> be<00:02:25.099> where<00:02:25.430> you

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
middle it doesn't have to be where you

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.030 
middle it doesn't have to be where you
pump<00:02:25.819> the<00:02:26.000> hole<00:02:26.209> doesn't<00:02:27.019> have<00:02:27.349> to<00:02:27.590> be<00:02:27.739> right

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
pump the hole doesn't have to be right

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.790 
pump the hole doesn't have to be right
there<00:02:28.540> anything<00:02:29.540> anywhere<00:02:30.230> from<00:02:30.410> either<00:02:30.560> male

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
there anything anywhere from either male

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.380 
there anything anywhere from either male
just<00:02:31.730> throw<00:02:31.970> it<00:02:32.030> up

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
just throw it up

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.990 
just throw it up
just<00:02:32.720> find<00:02:32.989> the<00:02:33.110> middle<00:02:33.410> where<00:02:34.160> where<00:02:34.880> it's

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
just find the middle where where it's

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.880 
just find the middle where where it's
place<00:02:35.360> so<00:02:36.819> yeah<00:02:37.819> so<00:02:38.209> I'll<00:02:38.780> show<00:02:38.989> an<00:02:39.080> example<00:02:39.140> if

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
place so yeah so I'll show an example if

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.190 
place so yeah so I'll show an example if
when<00:02:40.549> you<00:02:40.640> don't<00:02:40.880> um<00:02:41.269> put<00:02:41.840> it<00:02:41.870> in<00:02:41.989> the<00:02:42.049> middle

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
when you don't um put it in the middle

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.330 
when you don't um put it in the middle
what<00:02:42.830> you<00:02:43.610> see<00:02:43.819> they'll<00:02:44.090> just<00:02:44.269> fall<00:02:44.569> right<00:02:44.930> off

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
what you see they'll just fall right off

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.339 
what you see they'll just fall right off
but<00:02:46.340> if<00:02:46.459> you<00:02:46.580> put<00:02:46.760> in<00:02:46.849> the<00:02:46.940> middle<00:02:47.110> they<00:02:48.110> can't

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:48.349 
but if you put in the middle they can't

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:49.839 
but if you put in the middle they can't
decide<00:02:48.590> which<00:02:48.920> way<00:02:49.190> to<00:02:49.220> go

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:49.849 
decide which way to go

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:56.289 
decide which way to go
so<00:02:50.750> yeah<00:02:51.160> and<00:02:53.110> step<00:02:54.110> well<00:02:54.590> there's<00:02:54.890> many<00:02:55.790> many

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
so yeah and step well there's many many

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.539 
so yeah and step well there's many many
ways<00:02:56.480> to<00:02:56.540> do<00:02:56.810> it<00:02:56.840> one<00:02:57.470> ways<00:02:57.709> to<00:02:57.980> do<00:02:58.130> that<00:02:58.280> this

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
ways to do it one ways to do that this

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:01.720 
ways to do it one ways to do that this
like<00:02:59.450> you've<00:02:59.720> wrinkly<00:03:00.290> it<00:03:00.560> in<00:03:00.709> the<00:03:01.430> other<00:03:01.549> way

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
like you've wrinkly it in the other way

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.240 
like you've wrinkly it in the other way
you<00:03:01.790> turn<00:03:02.329> it<00:03:02.450> out<00:03:02.569> turn<00:03:02.989> out<00:03:03.170> it's<00:03:03.890> just<00:03:04.069> for

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
you turn it out turn out it's just for

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.360 
you turn it out turn out it's just for
the<00:03:04.340> chest<00:03:04.640> turn<00:03:04.970> out<00:03:05.150> that<00:03:05.510> I<00:03:06.200> can't<00:03:07.190> really

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
the chest turn out that I can't really

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.220 
the chest turn out that I can't really
do<00:03:07.670> that<00:03:07.840> it's<00:03:08.840> hard<00:03:09.019> for<00:03:09.079> me<00:03:09.410> but<00:03:10.220> I<00:03:10.250> do<00:03:10.310> is
