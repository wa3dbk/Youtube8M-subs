today's<00:00:16.760> update<00:00:17.030> video<00:00:17.510> we're<00:00:17.750> going<00:00:17.900> to

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:17.990 
today's update video we're going to

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.020 
today's update video we're going to
cover<00:00:18.050> fire<00:00:18.560> charges<00:00:19.130> wooden<00:00:19.520> button<00:00:19.910> and

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:20.030 
cover fire charges wooden button and

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.470 
cover fire charges wooden button and
item<00:00:20.690> frames<00:00:21.200> so<00:00:22.100> we'll<00:00:22.640> start<00:00:22.790> the<00:00:23.119> buttons

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 
item frames so we'll start the buttons

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.929 
item frames so we'll start the buttons
now<00:00:23.720> on<00:00:23.960> the<00:00:24.080> pc<00:00:24.470> version<00:00:24.580> they<00:00:25.580> put<00:00:25.790> these

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:25.939 
now on the pc version they put these

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.510 
now on the pc version they put these
buttons<00:00:26.360> out<00:00:26.660> because<00:00:27.500> you<00:00:28.010> could<00:00:28.189> shoot<00:00:28.369> them

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:28.520 
buttons out because you could shoot them

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.580 
buttons out because you could shoot them
with<00:00:28.550> an<00:00:28.760> arrow<00:00:29.000> and<00:00:29.360> it'd<00:00:29.450> be<00:00:29.599> easier<00:00:30.050> to<00:00:30.380> do

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
with an arrow and it'd be easier to do

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.080 
with an arrow and it'd be easier to do
and<00:00:30.890> like<00:00:31.009> custom<00:00:31.430> maps<00:00:31.640> you<00:00:31.820> know<00:00:31.910> you<00:00:32.000> have

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
and like custom maps you know you have

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.490 
and like custom maps you know you have
little<00:00:32.300> challenges<00:00:32.840> by<00:00:32.989> shooting<00:00:33.290> them<00:00:33.380> with

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
little challenges by shooting them with

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.990 
little challenges by shooting them with
arrows<00:00:33.680> from<00:00:33.920> a<00:00:34.010> distance<00:00:34.430> to<00:00:34.520> open<00:00:34.790> up<00:00:34.880> an

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
arrows from a distance to open up an

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.870 
arrows from a distance to open up an
area<00:00:35.210> now<00:00:36.020> I<00:00:36.050> think<00:00:36.290> forge<00:00:36.800> a<00:00:36.980> studio<00:00:37.400> forgot

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:37.880 
area now I think forge a studio forgot

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.060 
area now I think forge a studio forgot
that<00:00:38.180> because<00:00:38.660> if<00:00:38.900> you<00:00:38.989> shoot<00:00:39.200> these<00:00:39.440> they<00:00:40.010> do

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
that because if you shoot these they do

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.160 
that because if you shoot these they do
not<00:00:40.310> open<00:00:40.579> the<00:00:40.640> door<00:00:40.880> so<00:00:41.450> what<00:00:41.690> is<00:00:41.720> the<00:00:41.960> point

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
not open the door so what is the point

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:43.930 
not open the door so what is the point
of<00:00:42.380> wooden<00:00:42.710> buttons<00:00:42.950> if<00:00:43.220> you<00:00:43.370> can't<00:00:43.610> shoot

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
of wooden buttons if you can't shoot

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.240 
of wooden buttons if you can't shoot
them<00:00:44.180> to<00:00:44.210> open<00:00:44.570> doors<00:00:44.810> the<00:00:45.410> only<00:00:45.710> other<00:00:45.739> point

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
them to open doors the only other point

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.770 
them to open doors the only other point
I<00:00:46.489> could<00:00:46.699> think<00:00:46.850> of<00:00:47.030> for<00:00:47.090> wooden<00:00:47.390> button<00:00:47.660> is

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
I could think of for wooden button is

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.009 
I could think of for wooden button is
just<00:00:48.079> to<00:00:48.230> have<00:00:48.410> a<00:00:48.680> wooden<00:00:49.070> button<00:00:49.430> instead<00:00:49.850> of

00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:50.019 
just to have a wooden button instead of

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:52.270 
just to have a wooden button instead of
instead<00:00:51.019> of<00:00:51.079> having<00:00:51.350> an<00:00:51.500> iron<00:00:51.710> just<00:00:52.100> to<00:00:52.190> have

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
instead of having an iron just to have

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.919 
instead of having an iron just to have
another<00:00:52.550> option<00:00:52.850> and<00:00:53.480> I<00:00:53.539> think<00:00:53.629> it's<00:00:53.870> really

00:00:53.919 --> 00:00:53.929 
another option and I think it's really

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:56.680 
another option and I think it's really
dumb<00:00:54.289> because<00:00:54.500> these<00:00:54.739> were<00:00:54.949> made<00:00:55.160> to<00:00:56.000> help

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
dumb because these were made to help

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.509 
dumb because these were made to help
creative<00:00:57.320> maps<00:00:57.679> so<00:00:57.980> you<00:00:58.070> can<00:00:58.219> shoot<00:00:58.460> the

00:00:58.509 --> 00:00:58.519 
creative maps so you can shoot the

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:00.310 
creative maps so you can shoot the
button<00:00:58.910> from<00:00:59.089> a<00:00:59.179> distance<00:00:59.570> and<00:00:59.660> it<00:00:59.809> open<00:01:00.170> and

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
button from a distance and it open and

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.200 
button from a distance and it open and
it<00:01:00.679> just<00:01:00.829> doesn't<00:01:01.129> work<00:01:01.190> that<00:01:01.429> way<00:01:01.609> so<00:01:02.030> right

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
it just doesn't work that way so right

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.700 
it just doesn't work that way so right
away<00:01:02.239> it's<00:01:02.570> already<00:01:02.839> broken<00:01:03.170> and<00:01:03.469> it's<00:01:03.559> really

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
away it's already broken and it's really

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.710 
away it's already broken and it's really
stupid<00:01:04.010> they<00:01:04.280> added<00:01:04.550> it<00:01:04.640> if<00:01:04.760> you<00:01:04.879> can't<00:01:05.210> shoot

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
stupid they added it if you can't shoot

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.020 
stupid they added it if you can't shoot
them<00:01:05.990> but<00:01:06.530> that<00:01:07.040> is<00:01:07.190> wooden<00:01:07.550> buttons<00:01:07.730> let's

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
them but that is wooden buttons let's

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.630 
them but that is wooden buttons let's
move<00:01:08.150> on<00:01:08.300> to<00:01:08.420> fire<00:01:08.750> charges<00:01:09.380> so<00:01:09.830> fire<00:01:10.070> charges

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
move on to fire charges so fire charges

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.040 
move on to fire charges so fire charges
are<00:01:10.790> these<00:01:10.970> things<00:01:11.240> right<00:01:11.480> here<00:01:11.540> that<00:01:11.930> the

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.050 
are these things right here that the

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.780 
are these things right here that the
gases<00:01:12.560> shoot<00:01:12.770> at<00:01:12.920> you<00:01:13.100> and<00:01:13.250> also<00:01:13.520> the<00:01:13.640> in

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
gases shoot at you and also the in

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.030 
gases shoot at you and also the in
dragon<00:01:14.210> shoots<00:01:14.450> at<00:01:14.659> you<00:01:14.870> but<00:01:15.230> there's<00:01:15.710> has

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
dragon shoots at you but there's has

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.950 
dragon shoots at you but there's has
indoor<00:01:16.460> acid<00:01:16.790> on<00:01:16.880> it<00:01:16.909> but<00:01:17.600> they're<00:01:17.750> the<00:01:17.810> same

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
indoor acid on it but they're the same

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.660 
indoor acid on it but they're the same
exact<00:01:18.260> thing<00:01:18.530> so<00:01:19.040> what<00:01:19.250> you<00:01:19.370> can<00:01:19.460> do<00:01:19.550> with

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
exact thing so what you can do with

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.160 
exact thing so what you can do with
these<00:01:19.760> you<00:01:20.060> can<00:01:20.180> set<00:01:20.330> them<00:01:20.450> into<00:01:20.630> a<00:01:20.660> dispenser

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
these you can set them into a dispenser

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.380 
these you can set them into a dispenser
and<00:01:21.320> you<00:01:21.410> can<00:01:21.560> fire<00:01:22.160> them<00:01:22.310> you<00:01:22.850> can<00:01:23.000> fire<00:01:23.240> them

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
and you can fire them you can fire them

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.620 
and you can fire them you can fire them
off<00:01:23.600> pretty<00:01:24.350> far<00:01:24.800> they<00:01:25.220> go<00:01:25.460> pretty<00:01:25.940> damn<00:01:26.300> far

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
off pretty far they go pretty damn far

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.240 
off pretty far they go pretty damn far
out<00:01:26.840> there<00:01:27.110> and<00:01:27.320> sometimes<00:01:27.680> they<00:01:28.010> don't<00:01:28.100> go

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
out there and sometimes they don't go

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.250 
out there and sometimes they don't go
that<00:01:28.400> far<00:01:28.580> but<00:01:28.790> most<00:01:29.030> of<00:01:29.120> the<00:01:29.180> time<00:01:29.330> they<00:01:29.540> do<00:01:29.600> so

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
that far but most of the time they do so

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.600 
that far but most of the time they do so
there's<00:01:30.440> a<00:01:30.500> couple<00:01:30.650> examples<00:01:30.890> when<00:01:31.370> you<00:01:31.460> shoot

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
there's a couple examples when you shoot

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.490 
there's a couple examples when you shoot
a<00:01:31.700> couple<00:01:31.850> of<00:01:32.060> them<00:01:32.180> out<00:01:34.660> and<00:01:35.660> you<00:01:36.140> know<00:01:36.230> some

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
a couple of them out and you know some

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.470 
a couple of them out and you know some
land<00:01:36.680> here<00:01:37.070> some<00:01:37.340> go<00:01:37.490> way<00:01:37.610> up<00:01:37.640> there<00:01:38.000> just<00:01:38.360> how

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:38.480 
land here some go way up there just how
