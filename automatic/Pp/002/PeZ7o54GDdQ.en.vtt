00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
decided to completely change but I

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.669 
decided to completely change but I
normally<00:00:08.519> have<00:00:08.760> I've<00:00:09.300> had<00:00:09.570> the<00:00:09.840> pastel<00:00:10.349> purple

hair for over a year now
so<00:00:13.380> I<00:00:13.410> thought<00:00:13.679> I<00:00:13.920> would<00:00:14.389> go<00:00:15.389> kind<00:00:16.379> of<00:00:16.590> in<00:00:16.800> the

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
so I thought I would go kind of in the

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.189 
so I thought I would go kind of in the
direction<00:00:17.130> of<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:18.510> character<00:00:18.930> who<00:00:19.050> plays

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
just so used to having my hair on my

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.750 
just so used to having my hair on my
life<00:01:10.110> I<00:01:10.380> really<00:01:10.890> couldn't<00:01:11.130> handle<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.549> and

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
life I really couldn't handle it and

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.550 
life I really couldn't handle it and
after<00:01:12.150> about<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.360> month<00:01:12.510> I<00:01:12.750> immediately<00:01:13.020> went

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
after about a month I immediately went

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.219 
after about a month I immediately went
back<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.860> blonde<00:01:14.189> so<00:01:15.030> I<00:01:15.360> thought<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.780> wig<00:01:16.020> would

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
back to blonde so I thought a wig would

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.539 
back to blonde so I thought a wig would
be<00:01:16.380> kind<00:01:16.770> of<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:17.070> nice<00:01:17.400> mix<00:01:18.030> up<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:19.049> I<00:01:20.040> also<00:01:20.340> did

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
be kind of a nice mix up and I also did

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:21.890 
be kind of a nice mix up and I also did
it<00:01:20.640> because<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.909> lot<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.090> people<00:01:21.390> always<00:01:21.570> tell

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
it because a lot of people always tell

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.370 
it because a lot of people always tell
me<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.229> I<00:01:22.590> should<00:01:23.520> dye<00:01:23.820> my<00:01:24.000> hair<00:01:24.030> dark<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.780> I

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
me that I should dye my hair dark and I

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.499 
me that I should dye my hair dark and I
do<00:01:25.500> think<00:01:25.830> it's<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:26.009> nice<00:01:26.100> change<00:01:26.400> I<00:01:26.700> do<00:01:26.790> like<00:01:27.360> my

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
do think it's a nice change I do like my

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.050 
do think it's a nice change I do like my
blonde<00:01:27.720> hair<00:01:27.840> better<00:01:28.110> I'm<00:01:29.100> not<00:01:29.189> sure<00:01:29.640> how<00:01:29.909> much

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060
