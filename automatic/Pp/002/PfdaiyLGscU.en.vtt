the<00:00:40.320> standard<00:00:40.829> orthogonal<00:00:41.790> view<00:00:42.059> so<00:00:42.270> I'm

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
the standard orthogonal view so I'm

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.940 
the standard orthogonal view so I'm
going<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.510> go<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.690> front<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.350> change

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
going to go to front and change

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.650 
going to go to front and change
perspective<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.700> orthogonal<00:00:45.030> there's<00:00:45.570> a

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
perspective to orthogonal there's a

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.049 
perspective to orthogonal there's a
background<00:00:46.200> image<00:00:46.760> scrolling<00:00:47.760> in<00:00:47.850> with<00:00:47.969> the

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
background image scrolling in with the

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.420 
background image scrolling in with the
mouse<00:00:48.239> wheel<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:49.410> background<00:00:49.739> image<00:00:49.860> is<00:00:50.100> very

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
mouse wheel the background image is very

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.189 
mouse wheel the background image is very
large<00:00:50.670> so<00:00:50.879> I'm<00:00:51.090> going<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.239> go<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.420> size<00:00:51.809> I'm

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
large so I'm going to go to size I'm

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.709 
large so I'm going to go to size I'm
going<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.440> drag<00:00:52.710> on<00:00:52.980> size<00:00:53.360> to<00:00:54.360> make<00:00:54.510> that

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
going to drag on size to make that

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.319 
going to drag on size to make that
smaller<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.649> then<00:00:56.370> i'll<00:00:56.610> click<00:00:56.789> on<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.090> side

and get to about there I don't want the

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.510 
and get to about there I don't want the
background<00:02:07.260> image<00:02:07.590> anymore<00:02:08.100> so<00:02:08.280> I'm<00:02:08.369> there

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
background image anymore so I'm there

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.880 
background image anymore so I'm there
untok<00:02:09.060> background<00:02:09.540> images<00:02:09.900> I<00:02:10.140> don't<00:02:10.530> want<00:02:10.710> the

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
untok background images I don't want the

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.770 
untok background images I don't want the
3d<00:02:11.460> manipulator<00:02:11.670> widget<00:02:12.420> so<00:02:12.510> I'm<00:02:12.600> going<00:02:12.720> to

turn<00:02:12.870> that<00:02:13.020> off<00:02:13.290> I<00:02:13.530> want<00:02:14.220> to<00:02:14.250> make<00:02:14.400> an<00:02:14.550> edge

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
turn that off I want to make an edge

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.700 
turn that off I want to make an edge
here<00:02:15.300> so<00:02:15.600> i'm<00:02:15.750> going<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:15.960> hold<00:02:16.050> down<00:02:16.170> shift<00:02:16.530> and

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
here so i'm going to hold down shift and

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.270 
here so i'm going to hold down shift and
