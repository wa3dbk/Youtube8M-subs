00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:03.589
 Patient and white 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.339
 At that time iphone was used 

00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:11.219
 Yano I have experience in the future 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.449
 I've used it after thinking so much interesting so far 

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:15.019
 I want to 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:19.949
 After that that is effective in the flower bed iphone and it is as interesting as Kanto or 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.859
 If you can use what you thought 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.589
 Security I am that 

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:27.799
 I am using it as a mail browsing software 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.159
 I am using gmail 

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:33.420
 Nano will 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.470
 My work is in the works 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.920
 The first of the difficult serve to start within the gf of the email address 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.410
 I used it for the lyrics of せ る Ameya and its but 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:42.160
 that is 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.120
 All Milky Mail 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.810
 I'm using it as a peal of that spam email 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.000
 It is p2p21 original It gathers all at once and the spar is also a step there 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.280
 I have to do it 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.520
 It is quite a lot, but especially in my school, which was a cross panel 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.040
 Because it is 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.100
 From there 8 gmail addressed to myself 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.179
 Forward to address 

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:04.489
 I see everything in the existing gmail 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:05.630
 iphone is that 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.310
 Because it is good Google mobile compatibility 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.729
 I will see it here 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:12.960
 Well, I have a hand here now 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.240
 I have it 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.109
 I'm using it to see nakbameille that was dressing room and the rest 

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:23.420
 In order to do what you chase, about 8 shooter software 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.740
 There is, but I just say that 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.730
 Sometimes I'm looking to keep up 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.730
 This is not as much as I thought at first 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.370
 That google map that is attached to that map software than that 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.770
 so 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.870
 The map I printed out before that 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.470
 I bought one now with the department store but I bought it now 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:42.410
 Recently 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.990
 Look at the map of that icon 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.170
 View email 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.509
 Do chase 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:50.210
 Get 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.710
 View nap 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:52.880
 Nowadays 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.980
 With spending decision software 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.200
 That google calendar 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.420
 Large adjective 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.780
 I'm a nutritionist 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.230
 I only use these four 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.620
 But most of its dedicated software and most games 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.620
 I do not own it and the other four countries also 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:11.649
 Hardly have 

00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:12.670
 Just in the meantime 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.959
 What won is the Space Battleship Yamato 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.810
 What a mountain and resurrection Hen- 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.449
 I got a lot of movies 

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:22.319
 If you think that it is good after using great download time that 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.430
 Kanako Yamada I'm doing now OO It's almost like a mind and body 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:26.699
 Round in 

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:28.759
 I'm happy but 

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:31.769
 It is I like Yamamoto when it is said that this Yamato is its command 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.999
 It would be that thought like this 

00:02:33.999 --> 00:02:36.009
 I'm looking at my ears 

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:38.439
 National treasure main hall 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:41.739
 Do you use it as a songwriter? 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.319
 As much as that 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.179
 Art car party executives 

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:51.339
 I'm doing it without the scary feeling I've been here in that style 

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:51.939
 I will 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:53.749
 this 

00:02:53.749 --> 00:02:56.559
 What a function like Yamashina Station 

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:58.570
 After all the Internet 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.359
 I understood that 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:01.330
 Investigation difficult 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.249
 Because you can search google search college student 

00:03:04.249 --> 00:03:05.769
 5 items in this 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:08.580
 If you have a food for the icon, you can buy it and search for it 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.180
 If I thought that I would not show it near here 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.639
 It will mark because it will look for 

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:14.879
 About 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:17.879
 Such function is necessary to plan the price of summer air conditioner 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:19.019
 Things 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.589
 I think it's Fu, so after all 

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:24.099
 I think mobile phone of i plaza has always been 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:26.579
 I have never used iphone in the field 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:29.889
 hdemail icon's haunting 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:32.969
 I have never used Softbank Mail for that matter 

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:36.489
 All your e-mails using that docomo phone 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:38.639
 All blackouts go out of DOCOMO 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:39.500
 iphone 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.949
 Completely with email browser and internet browser 

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:45.189
 There was also a backstage back 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:47.959
 I only use it 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:49.209
 I love you 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.139
 Kyoto Odori is so colorful 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:52.760
 I explained my usage 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.079
 That's right rice 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:56.679
 That's why I thought 

00:03:56.679 --> 00:04:00.529
 Oricon's main body for those who think that they are expensive now and like a week 

00:04:00.529 --> 00:04:02.730
 I wonder if it's going to stir up 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.519
 One model from 50 years old 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:06.599
 that 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:08.279
 I'm too technical 

00:04:08.279 --> 00:04:10.379
 I think I 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:12.629
 A turn from the 50-year-old series 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:14.909
 When I say a blog from the age of 50 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:18.419
 Containers from the age of 50 

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:22.250
 A low pound for not using Katakana requests as much as possible 

00:04:22.249 --> 00:04:24.630
 Isn't it a dream I used to run for a temple? 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.470
 Without it insider 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.690
 It's only natural for you not to be good at buddy 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.360
 I'm going to take a stance like 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.129
 It is other least naive using such software in the first screen of the rice 

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:38.370
 Is there a lot more or use the same software 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.360
 That one screen and stimulant 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.809
 Heaven is in attendance 

00:04:41.809 --> 00:04:43.430
 I can use iphone 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.009
 50 years old thinking that it would be the most enjoyable to do a book 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:50.009
 If it was iconic from here, it was out here 

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:52.020
 I was at 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.729
 It seems that you didn't think at all 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:58.849
 What is the current era of disposable income 10 days after digital 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:02.780
 Potential interest in gadgets and how much they actually have 

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:06.229
 In fact, iphone and smart phone 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:10.870
 A little expensive ones are men and women in their 40s and 50s 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.050
 I think that the first is good 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.289
 I thought that kind of marketing like that with a gun 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:18.159
 In fact 

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:21.339
 It's been shaken so much in the 50's book for a while 

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:23.289
 I use it for a while and I use it often. 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:26.190
 Because you can not look so enjoyable even if you use love 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:27.469
 Well then this is 

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:30.959
 It's a waste of money in the city and it's funny to get caught at all 

00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:32.659
 Is not it? 

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:33.749
 It is such a feeling 

00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:37.739
 I'm sorry I can not come to Kamakura or one by one 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:39.429
