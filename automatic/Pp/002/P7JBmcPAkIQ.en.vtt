00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.000
 imagine that he would play 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.220
 rules for football because of insecurity 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.199

 the always in football get out 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:45.119
 portland to many other things that I 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.070
 needs to 

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:50.350

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:58.299
 tranquility with means look how is 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.710

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:02.530
 is that guardiola is always that is so 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.869
 beautiful as a tonic that helps from memory 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.760
 micro and that is a community like 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:09.520
 as an act rather than communicating the truth is 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.500
 that comes from our khalfan notes from 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.659
