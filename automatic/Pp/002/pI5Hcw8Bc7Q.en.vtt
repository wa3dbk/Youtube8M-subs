00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
have one mic preamp this would be a

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.580 
have one mic preamp this would be a
great<00:00:38.730> one<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:38.910> have<00:00:39.030> on<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.020> front<00:00:40.260> panel<00:00:40.410> we

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
great one to have on the front panel we

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.049 
great one to have on the front panel we
have<00:00:40.710> four<00:00:40.860> features<00:00:41.190> we<00:00:41.430> have<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.579> stepped

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.310 
have four features we have a stepped
gain<00:00:42.690> control<00:00:43.820> and<00:00:44.820> then<00:00:45.480> we<00:00:45.629> have<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:45.840> variable

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
gain control and then we have a variable

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.889 
gain control and then we have a variable
output<00:00:46.590> control<00:00:47.460> which<00:00:47.910> is<00:00:48.120> very<00:00:48.660> handy

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
output control which is very handy

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.220 
output control which is very handy
another<00:00:49.649> handy<00:00:50.160> thing<00:00:50.480> this<00:00:51.480> got<00:00:51.690> is<00:00:51.840> an<00:00:51.960> input

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
another handy thing this got is an input

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.090 
another handy thing this got is an input
and<00:00:52.649> an<00:00:52.860> output<00:00:53.210> level<00:00:54.210> metering<00:00:55.079> which<00:00:55.800> works

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
and an output level metering which works

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.750 
and an output level metering which works
very<00:00:56.430> well<00:00:56.579> I<00:00:57.000> used<00:00:57.390> I<00:00:57.660> use<00:00:57.960> this<00:00:58.760> preamp

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
very well I used I use this preamp

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.660 
very well I used I use this preamp
almost<00:01:00.059> on<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.239> daily<00:01:00.600> business<00:01:00.719> at<00:01:01.079> work<00:01:01.670> and

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
almost on a daily business at work and

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.690 
almost on a daily business at work and
it's<00:01:03.320> you<00:01:04.320> know<00:01:04.379> it's<00:01:04.619> just<00:01:04.799> super<00:01:05.100> handy<00:01:05.400> it's

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
it's you know it's just super handy it's

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.700 
it's you know it's just super handy it's
not<00:01:05.850> just<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.060> be<00:01:06.119> able<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.270> see<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.479> level<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.590> be

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
not just to be able to see a level to be

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.370 
not just to be able to see a level to be
sure<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:08.010> got<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.280> mic<00:01:08.460> plugged<00:01:08.760> in<00:01:09.060> or<00:01:09.360> or<00:01:10.110> if

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
sure you got the mic plugged in or or if

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.630 
sure you got the mic plugged in or or if
there's<00:01:10.560> no<00:01:10.710> signal<00:01:11.040> coming<00:01:11.189> down<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.460> path

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
there's no signal coming down the path

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.390 
there's no signal coming down the path
due<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.030> bad<00:01:12.810> mic<00:01:13.080> cable<00:01:13.409> or<00:01:13.470> something<00:01:13.619> so

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
due to a bad mic cable or something so

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.630 
due to a bad mic cable or something so
it's<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.670> real<00:01:14.909> easy<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.390> tweak<00:01:15.600> thing<00:01:16.640> super

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
it's a real easy to tweak thing super

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.730 
it's a real easy to tweak thing super
well-built<00:01:18.180> like<00:01:19.020> I<00:01:19.140> said<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.439> sounds

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
well-built like I said it sounds

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.170 
well-built like I said it sounds
incredible<00:01:20.159> on<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.340> front<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:20.759> also<00:01:20.880> have<00:01:21.150> a

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
incredible on the front you also have a

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.200 
incredible on the front you also have a
polarity<00:01:22.049> switch<00:01:22.320> for<00:01:22.560> reversing<00:01:23.070> phase<00:01:23.310> you

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
polarity switch for reversing phase you

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.760 
polarity switch for reversing phase you
have<00:01:24.330> your<00:01:24.479> phantom<00:01:24.840> power<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.500> all<00:01:25.650> these

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
have your phantom power and all these

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.109 
have your phantom power and all these
have<00:01:25.920> little<00:01:26.159> lights<00:01:26.369> on<00:01:26.580> them<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.850> let<00:01:27.030> you

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
have little lights on them to let you

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.719 
have little lights on them to let you
know<00:01:27.299> that<00:01:28.229> they're<00:01:28.740> working<00:01:28.890> or<00:01:29.100> not<00:01:29.130> you

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
know that they're working or not you

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.039 
know that they're working or not you
have<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:29.939> dual<00:01:30.240> impedance<00:01:31.280> and<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:33.049> loading

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
have a dual impedance and a loading

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.620 
have a dual impedance and a loading
button<00:01:34.380> both<00:01:34.740> of<00:01:34.890> those<00:01:35.040> color<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.180> sound<00:01:36.450> a

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
button both of those color the sound a

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.490 
button both of those color the sound a
little<00:01:36.780> bit<00:01:37.130> you<00:01:38.130> know<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.960> impedance<00:01:39.960> button

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
little bit you know the impedance button

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.340 
little bit you know the impedance button
you<00:01:40.680> know<00:01:41.390> loads<00:01:42.390> down<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.869> output<00:01:43.049> of<00:01:43.259> the

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
you know loads down the output of the

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.480 
you know loads down the output of the
microphone<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.770> little<00:01:43.829> bit<00:01:44.009> differently<00:01:44.399> and

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
microphone a little bit differently and

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.010 
microphone a little bit differently and
you'll<00:01:44.610> get<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.759> little<00:01:44.939> bit<00:01:45.030> more<00:01:45.689> or<00:01:45.869> less

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
you'll get a little bit more or less

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.780 
you'll get a little bit more or less
output<00:01:46.350> depending<00:01:47.189> how<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:47.340> got<00:01:47.670> that

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
output depending how you got that

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.280 
output depending how you got that
depressed<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:48.810> know<00:01:48.869> you<00:01:48.960> get<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.110> little

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
depressed and you know you get a little

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.260 
depressed and you know you get a little
less<00:01:49.530> or<00:01:49.680> more<00:01:49.799> thick<00:01:50.100> sound<00:01:50.399> with<00:01:51.090> the

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
less or more thick sound with the

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.789 
less or more thick sound with the
loading<00:01:51.600> button<00:01:51.960> so<00:01:52.140> you<00:01:52.200> got<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.470> little<00:01:52.710> bit

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
loading button so you got a little bit

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.160 
loading button so you got a little bit
of<00:01:52.890> tonal<00:01:53.220> variety<00:01:53.700> here<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.329> this<00:01:55.020> is

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
of tonal variety here and this is

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.980 
of tonal variety here and this is
definitely<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.770> thick<00:01:56.579> seinem<00:01:57.420> preamp<00:01:57.810> if

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
definitely a thick seinem preamp if
