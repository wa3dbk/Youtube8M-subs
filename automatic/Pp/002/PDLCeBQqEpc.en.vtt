00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
are you're going to throw the angles off

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.560 
are you're going to throw the angles off
if<00:00:40.140> you<00:00:40.379> take<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.710> point<00:00:41.010> of<00:00:41.820> your<00:00:41.969> file<00:00:42.239> and

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
start digging in very carefully you'll

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.950 
start digging in very carefully you'll
start<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.289> make<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.649> hole<00:00:46.829> all<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.100> way<00:00:47.190> through

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
start to make a hole all the way through

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.310 
start to make a hole all the way through
well<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.890> will<00:00:50.070> need<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.370> do<00:00:50.550> this<00:00:51.289> for<00:00:52.289> both

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
well you will need to do this for both

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.369 
well you will need to do this for both
these<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.489> you'll<00:00:53.640> have<00:00:53.879> holes<00:00:54.230> similar<00:00:55.230> to

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
these and you'll have holes similar to

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.680 
these and you'll have holes similar to
this<00:00:55.530> if<00:00:55.890> for<00:00:56.160> some<00:00:56.219> reason<00:00:56.789> your<00:00:57.300> father's

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
this if for some reason your father's

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
not worked you will have to get a drill

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.049 
not worked you will have to get a drill
and<00:00:59.309> use<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.550> very<00:00:59.820> small<00:01:00.120> drill<00:01:00.390> bit<00:01:01.550> now<00:01:02.550> once

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
and use a very small drill bit now once

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.230 
and use a very small drill bit now once
you<00:01:03.180> have<00:01:03.329> those<00:01:03.510> two<00:01:03.570> made<00:01:04.939> and<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.030> take

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
you have those two made and you take

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.219 
you have those two made and you take
your<00:01:06.270> file<00:01:06.740> and<00:01:07.740> then<00:01:08.220> going<00:01:08.700> in<00:01:09.229> roughly

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
your file and then going in roughly

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.640 
your file and then going in roughly
about<00:01:10.439> an<00:01:10.860> inch<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.610> three<00:01:11.850> quarters<00:01:12.650> so

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
about an inch and three quarters so

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.010 
about an inch and three quarters so
somewhere<00:01:14.010> right<00:01:14.250> about<00:01:14.400> in<00:01:14.670> here<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:15.689> again

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
somewhere right about in here and again

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.010 
somewhere right about in here and again
make<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.009> hole<00:01:17.340> with<00:01:17.610> this<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.600> again<00:01:18.810> if<00:01:18.900> it

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
make a hole with this and again if it

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.160 
make a hole with this and again if it
doesn't<00:01:19.290> work<00:01:19.409> use<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.710> drill<00:01:20.040> bit<00:01:21.049> once<00:01:22.049> you

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
doesn't work use a drill bit once you

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.359 
doesn't work use a drill bit once you
have<00:01:22.320> those<00:01:23.990> you<00:01:24.990> look<00:01:25.259> something<00:01:25.740> similar<00:01:26.159> to

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
have those you look something similar to

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.560 
have those you look something similar to
this

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.350 

take<00:01:30.570> your<00:01:30.689> file<00:01:30.890> now<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.250> you'll<00:01:32.969> need<00:01:33.180> to

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
take your file now and you'll need to

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.510 
take your file now and you'll need to
start<00:01:33.719> filing<00:01:35.420> just<00:01:36.420> slightly<00:01:37.350> in<00:01:37.560> but<00:01:38.039> maybe

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
start filing just slightly in but maybe

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.480 
start filing just slightly in but maybe
a<00:01:38.759> half<00:01:39.030> an<00:01:39.210> inch<00:01:39.590> and<00:01:40.590> you'll<00:01:40.710> need<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.009> make<00:01:41.429> a

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
a half an inch and you'll need to make a

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.710 
a half an inch and you'll need to make a
nice<00:01:41.759> little<00:01:42.060> groove<00:01:42.420> here<00:01:44.329> I've<00:01:45.329> done<00:01:45.570> that

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
nice little groove here I've done that

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.499 
nice little groove here I've done that
with<00:01:45.869> these<00:01:46.020> already<00:01:46.640> as<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:47.819> can<00:01:48.030> see<00:01:48.270> here

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
with these already as you can see here

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.270 
with these already as you can see here
and<00:01:50.030> then<00:01:51.030> on<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.450> other<00:01:51.479> end<00:01:51.890> on<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.100> same

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
and then on the other end on the same

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.020 
and then on the other end on the same
side<00:01:54.200> you'll<00:01:55.200> need<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:56.039> make<00:01:56.220> a<00:01:56.460> little<00:01:56.850> bit

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
side you'll need to make a little bit

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.109 
side you'll need to make a little bit
smaller<00:01:57.420> groove<00:01:58.130> right<00:01:59.130> near<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.729> edge<00:01:59.880> be

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
smaller groove right near the edge be

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.669 
smaller groove right near the edge be
careful<00:02:00.450> not<00:02:00.539> to<00:02:00.599> get<00:02:00.750> too<00:02:00.810> funky<00:02:01.170> edge

00:02:01.669 --> 00:02:01.679 
careful not to get too funky edge

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:08.339 
careful not to get too funky edge
these<00:02:01.950> will<00:02:02.189> break<00:02:02.399> off

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:08.349 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:14.320 

now<00:02:08.950> it's<00:02:09.159> time<00:02:09.310> to<00:02:09.369> assemble<00:02:10.950> first

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.370 

don't<00:02:15.330> you<00:02:15.420> just<00:02:15.570> play<00:02:15.660> everything<00:02:15.990> out

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:26.360 

or<00:02:18.800> something<00:02:19.100> similar<00:02:19.490> to<00:02:19.700> this

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.230 

so

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:34.380 

take<00:02:29.870> a<00:02:29.900> paperclip<00:02:30.850> open<00:02:31.850> up<00:02:32.030> on<00:02:32.630> inside<00:02:33.080> of<00:02:33.320> it

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
take a paperclip open up on inside of it

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:42.070 
take a paperclip open up on inside of it
I'm<00:02:35.390> going<00:02:35.510> to<00:02:35.690> go<00:02:37.540> over<00:02:38.540> here<00:02:39.610> make<00:02:40.610> sure<00:02:41.080> you

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
I'm going to go over here make sure you

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.160 
I'm going to go over here make sure you
get

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:53.600
