site address studio vocal microphone

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.920 
site address studio vocal microphone
which<00:00:25.460> means<00:00:25.730> we<00:00:25.880> address<00:00:26.240> it<00:00:26.390> direct<00:00:26.720> on

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930 
which means we address it direct on

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.060 
which means we address it direct on
instead<00:00:27.380> of<00:00:27.439> from<00:00:27.770> the<00:00:27.890> top<00:00:28.869> the<00:00:29.869> shure<00:00:30.050> KSM<00:00:30.560> 42

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
instead of from the top the shure KSM 42

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.280 
instead of from the top the shure KSM 42
is<00:00:31.460> a<00:00:31.580> great<00:00:32.090> microphone<00:00:32.660> for<00:00:32.870> use<00:00:33.020> in<00:00:33.199> the

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 
is a great microphone for use in the

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.260 
is a great microphone for use in the
studio<00:00:33.590> for<00:00:33.800> vocal<00:00:34.129> applications<00:00:34.790> it<00:00:35.090> also

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
studio for vocal applications it also

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.060 
studio for vocal applications it also
has<00:00:35.510> a<00:00:35.540> few<00:00:35.780> other<00:00:35.809> applications<00:00:36.260> with<00:00:36.920> some

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
has a few other applications with some

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.619 
has a few other applications with some
different<00:00:37.430> instruments<00:00:37.970> but<00:00:38.150> for<00:00:38.360> now<00:00:38.449> we'll

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
different instruments but for now we'll

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:41.530 
different instruments but for now we'll
just<00:00:38.660> focus<00:00:39.170> on<00:00:39.320> the<00:00:39.440> vocal<00:00:39.770> part<00:00:40.330> comes<00:00:41.330> in<00:00:41.449> a

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
just focus on the vocal part comes in a

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.509 
just focus on the vocal part comes in a
cardioid<00:00:41.930> pattern<00:00:42.170> which<00:00:42.949> means<00:00:43.220> we<00:00:43.370> have

00:00:43.509 --> 00:00:43.519 
cardioid pattern which means we have

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:45.250 
cardioid pattern which means we have
excellent<00:00:44.000> pick<00:00:44.300> up<00:00:44.449> from<00:00:44.600> the<00:00:44.750> front<00:00:44.930> and

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
excellent pick up from the front and

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.370 
excellent pick up from the front and
it's<00:00:45.620> going<00:00:45.800> to<00:00:45.950> go<00:00:46.070> away<00:00:46.220> as<00:00:46.670> I<00:00:46.910> move<00:00:47.120> around

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:47.380 
it's going to go away as I move around

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.220 
it's going to go away as I move around
to<00:00:48.380> the<00:00:48.410> back<00:00:48.680> of<00:00:48.860> the<00:00:48.950> microphone<00:00:49.989> sure<00:00:50.989> did<00:00:51.170> a

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
to the back of the microphone sure did a

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.139 
to the back of the microphone sure did a
great<00:00:51.590> job<00:00:51.950> in<00:00:52.190> designing<00:00:52.520> the<00:00:52.700> physical

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
great job in designing the physical

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
just a few quick turns of the screw we

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.960 
just a few quick turns of the screw we
can<00:01:15.320> remove<00:01:15.590> the<00:01:15.770> 40<00:01:16.070> to<00:01:16.220> replace<00:01:16.640> it<00:01:16.819> with<00:01:16.850> a

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
can remove the 40 to replace it with a

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.109 
can remove the 40 to replace it with a
44<00:01:17.600> or<00:01:17.959> a<00:01:18.080> 32<00:01:18.649> or<00:01:18.860> a<00:01:19.069> bunch<00:01:19.459> of<00:01:19.580> the<00:01:19.729> other<00:01:19.850> sure

44 or a 32 or a bunch of the other sure
KSM<00:01:20.630> series<00:01:21.220> but<00:01:22.220> one<00:01:22.759> of<00:01:22.789> the<00:01:22.910> most<00:01:23.000> important

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:23.539 
KSM series but one of the most important

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:25.059 
KSM series but one of the most important
things<00:01:23.720> about<00:01:23.840> this<00:01:24.140> particular<00:01:24.350> locking

00:01:25.059 --> 00:01:25.069 
things about this particular locking

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:28.089 
things about this particular locking
mechanism<00:01:25.610> is<00:01:26.270> if<00:01:26.479> we'd<00:01:26.630> like<00:01:26.810> to<00:01:26.929> use<00:01:27.110> this<00:01:27.350> in

00:01:28.089 --> 00:01:28.099 
mechanism is if we'd like to use this in

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:30.010 
mechanism is if we'd like to use this in
a<00:01:28.220> slightly<00:01:28.490> different<00:01:28.729> situation<00:01:29.119> like<00:01:29.810> as

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
a slightly different situation like as

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.350 
a slightly different situation like as
an<00:01:30.229> overhead<00:01:30.679> or<00:01:30.860> reaching<00:01:31.819> into<00:01:32.000> a<00:01:32.030> spot

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
an overhead or reaching into a spot

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.859 
an overhead or reaching into a spot
we're<00:01:32.539> not<00:01:32.660> sure<00:01:32.899> about<00:01:33.940> we<00:01:34.940> can<00:01:35.090> simply<00:01:37.869> turn

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
we're not sure about we can simply turn

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:40.480 
we're not sure about we can simply turn
the<00:01:39.020> entire<00:01:39.229> microphone<00:01:39.709> assembly<00:01:40.160> upside

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
the entire microphone assembly upside

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.889 
the entire microphone assembly upside
down<00:01:40.700> and<00:01:40.970> the<00:01:41.300> mic<00:01:41.450> stays<00:01:41.780> put

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:43.899 
down and the mic stays put

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:47.440 
down and the mic stays put
so<00:01:44.899> this<00:01:45.259> was<00:01:45.440> the<00:01:45.590> shirt<00:01:45.890> KSM<00:01:46.520> 42<00:01:47.209> large

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
so this was the shirt KSM 42 large

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.719 
so this was the shirt KSM 42 large
