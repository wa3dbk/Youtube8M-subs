00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
and been put on hold quite a bit so it

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.399 
and been put on hold quite a bit so it
doesn't<00:01:17.220> seem<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.549> be<00:01:17.720> a<00:01:18.720> thing<00:01:19.259> that's

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
doesn't seem to be a thing that's

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.670 
doesn't seem to be a thing that's
getting<00:01:19.560> sorted<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:21.350> think<00:01:22.350> this<00:01:22.500> is

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
getting sorted I think this is

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.320 
getting sorted I think this is
definitely<00:01:22.950> going<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.759> be<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.909> massive<00:01:24.299> problem

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330

everyone to be aware of this so that

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.929 
everyone to be aware of this so that

00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:43.939 
because I know that there's been people

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:45.789 
because I know that there's been people
that<00:02:43.970> have<00:02:44.180> only<00:02:44.450> had<00:02:44.750> 20<00:02:45.109> pounds<00:02:45.470> on<00:02:45.620> their

that have only had 20 pounds on their
account<00:02:46.159> and<00:02:46.400> then<00:02:47.329> there<00:02:47.900> something<00:02:48.620> get

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:48.799 
account and then there something get

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:51.220 
account and then there something get
renewed<00:02:48.980> because<00:02:49.579> of<00:02:49.900> not<00:02:50.900> having<00:02:50.930> enough

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
renewed because of not having enough

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.160 
renewed because of not having enough
money<00:02:51.620> in<00:02:52.010> their<00:02:52.250> wallets<00:02:52.750> so<00:02:53.750> I<00:02:53.780> think<00:02:53.959> this

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
money in their wallets so I think this

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.599 
money in their wallets so I think this
is<00:02:54.230> gonna<00:02:54.349> cause<00:02:54.620> a<00:02:54.650> lot<00:02:54.799> of<00:02:54.950> problems<00:02:55.340> for<00:02:55.579> a

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:55.609 
is gonna cause a lot of problems for a

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:57.490 
is gonna cause a lot of problems for a
lot<00:02:55.700> of<00:02:55.760> the<00:02:56.000> the<00:02:56.030> players<00:02:56.870> who<00:02:57.079> own<00:02:57.230> these

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
lot of the the players who own these

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.030 
lot of the the players who own these
special<00:02:58.659> memberships<00:02:59.659> and<00:02:59.900> I<00:02:59.989> think<00:03:00.170> a<00:03:00.409> lot<00:03:01.010> of

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
special memberships and I think a lot of

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.849 
special memberships and I think a lot of
people<00:03:01.510> are<00:03:02.510> not<00:03:02.720> aware<00:03:02.840> of<00:03:03.049> this<00:03:03.319> problem<00:03:03.739> the

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:03.859 
people are not aware of this problem the

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:05.559 
people are not aware of this problem the
only<00:03:04.040> reason<00:03:04.280> I<00:03:04.400> knew<00:03:04.609> if<00:03:04.730> found<00:03:05.299> out<00:03:05.450> about

only reason I knew if found out about

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:07.929 
only reason I knew if found out about
this<00:03:05.840> problem<00:03:06.230> was<00:03:06.379> because<00:03:06.560> I<00:03:06.980> wanted<00:03:07.639> to<00:03:07.760> get

00:03:07.929 --> 00:03:07.939 
this problem was because I wanted to get

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:08.729 
this problem was because I wanted to get
a<00:03:07.970> second

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
a second

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.280 
a second
legendary<00:03:09.739> membership<00:03:10.549> for<00:03:11.030> my<00:03:11.930> daughter's

legendary membership for my daughter's

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.039 
legendary membership for my daughter's
account<00:03:12.620> and<00:03:12.859> when<00:03:13.639> I<00:03:13.670> went<00:03:13.879> to<00:03:13.970> the<00:03:14.150> store

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
account and when I went to the store

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:16.750 
account and when I went to the store
because<00:03:15.859> it<00:03:16.069> was<00:03:16.250> supposed<00:03:16.459> to<00:03:16.519> be<00:03:16.639> on<00:03:16.730> a

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
because it was supposed to be on a

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.750 
because it was supposed to be on a
special<00:03:17.569> free<00:03:17.989> month<00:03:18.230> price<00:03:18.530> again<00:03:18.889> I<00:03:19.069> thought

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
special free month price again I thought

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.759 
special free month price again I thought
is<00:03:19.910> going<00:03:20.090> to<00:03:20.209> be<00:03:20.299> $19.99<00:03:21.260> I<00:03:21.440> checked<00:03:21.709> the

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
is going to be $19.99 I checked the

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:24.430 
is going to be $19.99 I checked the
price<00:03:22.010> and<00:03:22.250> it<00:03:22.340> came<00:03:22.579> up<00:03:22.760> on<00:03:22.879> there<00:03:23.299> for<00:03:23.480> $24.99

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
price and it came up on there for $24.99

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.990 
price and it came up on there for $24.99
so<00:03:24.470> I<00:03:24.709> already<00:03:24.919> knew<00:03:25.250> that<00:03:25.430> something<00:03:25.639> wasn't

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
so I already knew that something wasn't

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.869 
so I already knew that something wasn't
quite<00:03:26.209> right<00:03:26.470> so<00:03:27.470> I<00:03:27.799> checked<00:03:28.069> my<00:03:28.190> services

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:28.879 
quite right so I checked my services

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:30.640 
quite right so I checked my services
list<00:03:29.120> and<00:03:29.419> this<00:03:29.599> is<00:03:29.750> why<00:03:29.900> it<00:03:29.959> shows<00:03:30.230> up<00:03:30.470> it

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
list and this is why it shows up it

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.289 
list and this is why it shows up it
shows<00:03:30.859> up<00:03:31.040> $24.99<00:03:31.970> instead<00:03:32.750> of<00:03:32.870> the<00:03:32.989> agreed

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
shows up $24.99 instead of the agreed

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:39.129 
shows up $24.99 instead of the agreed
$19.99<00:03:35.560> so<00:03:36.560> I<00:03:36.949> will<00:03:37.250> post<00:03:37.549> the<00:03:37.750> the<00:03:38.750> Fred<00:03:38.959> that

might<00:04:00.109> get<00:04:00.290> sorted<00:04:01.220> for<00:04:01.459> us<00:04:01.780> because<00:04:02.780> I<00:04:02.810> think

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:03.319 
might get sorted for us because I think

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:04.809 
might get sorted for us because I think
this<00:04:03.440> is<00:04:03.560> going<00:04:03.680> to<00:04:03.739> be<00:04:03.859> a<00:04:03.889> really<00:04:04.370> big<00:04:04.579> problem

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:04.819 
this is going to be a really big problem

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:06.969 
this is going to be a really big problem
once<00:04:05.180> it<00:04:05.389> gets<00:04:05.569> around<00:04:05.930> the<00:04:06.109> October<00:04:06.650> kind<00:04:06.859> of

00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:06.979 
once it gets around the October kind of

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:10.119 
once it gets around the October kind of
time<00:04:07.639> I<00:04:07.909> think<00:04:08.269> a<00:04:08.419> lot<00:04:08.599> of<00:04:08.629> people's<00:04:09.019> subs<00:04:09.949> are

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:10.129 
time I think a lot of people's subs are

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:11.259 
time I think a lot of people's subs are
not<00:04:10.250> going<00:04:10.400> to<00:04:10.459> get<00:04:10.519> renewed<00:04:10.849> and<00:04:11.150> there's

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
not going to get renewed and there's

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:13.300 
not going to get renewed and there's
going<00:04:11.389> to<00:04:11.449> be<00:04:11.510> a<00:04:11.569> lot<00:04:11.720> of<00:04:11.750> angry<00:04:12.049> people<00:04:12.310> I

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
going to be a lot of angry people I

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.069 
going to be a lot of angry people I
think<00:04:13.790> this<00:04:14.120> will<00:04:14.269> only<00:04:14.419> get<00:04:14.599> sorted<00:04:14.900> if

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:15.079 
think this will only get sorted if

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:19.539 
think this will only get sorted if
