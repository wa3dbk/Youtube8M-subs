00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
you about that I always seem to have

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:54.920 
you about that I always seem to have
this<00:00:53.610> debates<00:00:53.940> when<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.270> Olympics<00:00:54.660> come<00:00:54.809> up

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
this debates when the Olympics come up

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.020 
this debates when the Olympics come up
do<00:00:55.860> you<00:00:55.949> think<00:00:56.160> there<00:00:56.280> should<00:00:56.430> be<00:00:56.460> hitting<00:00:56.820> in

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
do you think there should be hitting in

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.470 
do you think there should be hitting in
women's<00:00:57.300> hockey<00:00:57.500> um<00:00:58.500> part<00:00:59.340> of<00:00:59.399> me<00:00:59.489> thinks<00:00:59.520> yes

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
women's hockey um part of me thinks yes

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.790 
women's hockey um part of me thinks yes
because<00:01:00.870> I<00:01:00.960> think<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.230> would<00:01:01.320> be<00:01:01.440> easier<00:01:01.739> to

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
because I think it would be easier to

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.619 
because I think it would be easier to
officiate<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.520> game<00:01:02.550> I<00:01:02.910> think<00:01:03.390> sometimes

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
officiate the game I think sometimes

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.050 
officiate the game I think sometimes
it's<00:01:03.989> difficult<00:01:04.049> for<00:01:04.559> referees<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.790> know

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
it's difficult for referees to know

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.899 
it's difficult for referees to know
where<00:01:06.210> that<00:01:06.420> line<00:01:06.659> is<00:01:07.280> but<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.340> other<00:01:08.549> part<00:01:08.790> of

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
where that line is but the other part of

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.000 
where that line is but the other part of
me<00:01:09.030> thinks<00:01:09.450> that<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:09.810> know<00:01:10.560> they<00:01:10.770> at<00:01:10.860> the

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
me thinks that you know they at the

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.070 
me thinks that you know they at the
skill<00:01:11.280> level<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.000> overall<00:01:12.240> speed<00:01:12.930> of

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
skill level and the overall speed of

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.679 
skill level and the overall speed of
play<00:01:13.490> is<00:01:14.490> highlighted<00:01:15.030> without<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.420> hitting

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
play is highlighted without the hitting

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.510 
play is highlighted without the hitting
and<00:01:15.869> probably<00:01:16.409> needs<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.920> continue<00:01:17.189> for<00:01:17.460> the

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
and probably needs to continue for the

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.609 
and probably needs to continue for the
rest<00:01:17.580> of<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.790> world<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.150> develop<00:01:18.420> so<00:01:18.960> it's<00:01:19.500> a

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
rest of the world to develop so it's a

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.200 
rest of the world to develop so it's a
tough<00:01:19.799> question<00:01:19.979> i<00:01:20.460> think<00:01:20.670> it's<00:01:20.820> not<00:01:20.970> quite

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
tough question i think it's not quite

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.690 
tough question i think it's not quite
ready<00:01:21.450> but<00:01:21.540> i<00:01:21.960> would<00:01:22.590> be<00:01:22.740> interested<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:23.340> try

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
ready but i would be interested to try

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.090 
ready but i would be interested to try
an<00:01:23.939> experiment<00:01:24.299> with<00:01:24.600> it<00:01:24.630> see<00:01:25.110> ya<00:01:25.439> so<00:01:25.619> one<00:01:25.950> day

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
an experiment with it see ya so one day

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.640 
an experiment with it see ya so one day
maybe<00:01:26.670> one<00:01:26.909> day<00:01:27.060> yep<00:01:27.240> do<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.170> ever<00:01:28.229> lay<00:01:28.500> any

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
maybe one day yep do you ever lay any

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.670 
maybe one day yep do you ever lay any
bombs<00:01:28.890> in<00:01:29.100> this<00:01:29.220> game<00:01:29.780> yeah<00:01:30.780> well<00:01:31.530> I've<00:01:31.650> been

hit many times there's some big open ice
checks<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.259> happen<00:01:34.970> apparently<00:01:35.970> there's

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
checks that happen apparently there's

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.300 
checks that happen apparently there's
even<00:01:36.509> fighting<00:01:36.750> so<00:01:37.170> it'll<00:01:37.860> be<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:38.009> new

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
even fighting so it'll be a new
