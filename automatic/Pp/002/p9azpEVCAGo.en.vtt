00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.779 

wasn't<00:00:41.370> an<00:00:41.610> awful<00:00:41.940> job<00:00:43.399> looking<00:00:44.399> back<00:00:44.579> through

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
wasn't an awful job looking back through

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.020 
wasn't an awful job looking back through
this<00:00:44.940> thing<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.239> getting<00:00:46.489> the<00:00:47.489> process<00:00:47.700> of

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
this thing and getting the process of

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.840 
this thing and getting the process of
just<00:00:48.210> kind<00:00:48.390> of<00:00:48.420> working<00:00:48.809> our<00:00:49.020> way<00:00:49.050> through<00:00:49.170> it

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.639 

here<00:00:53.850> is<00:00:54.059> fairly<00:00:54.329> really<00:00:54.989> cleaned<00:00:55.199> up<00:00:55.320> in<00:00:55.500> this

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
here is fairly really cleaned up in this

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.330 
here is fairly really cleaned up in this
shot<00:00:56.690> looking<00:00:57.690> back<00:00:57.899> we<00:00:58.230> had<00:00:58.410> one<00:00:58.649> spot<00:00:58.949> of<00:00:59.100> rot

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
shot looking back we had one spot of rot

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.060 
shot looking back we had one spot of rot
that<00:00:59.370> was<00:00:59.820> in<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.059> plank<00:01:00.510> that<00:01:00.660> had<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.469> split<00:01:01.890> in

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
that was in a plank that had a split in

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.219 
that was in a plank that had a split in
it<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.609> apparently<00:01:02.879> on<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.329> split<00:01:04.140> in<00:01:04.199> the

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
it and apparently on the split in the

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.789 
it and apparently on the split in the
plank<00:01:04.530> there<00:01:04.799> were<00:01:04.890> some<00:01:05.489> rotted<00:01:05.880> form<00:01:06.150> so<00:01:06.360> we

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:06.799 
plank there were some rotted form so we

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:09.230 
plank there were some rotted form so we
ended<00:01:07.799> up<00:01:07.890> cutting<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.250> dragging<00:01:08.670> piece<00:01:08.880> and

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
ended up cutting a dragging piece and

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.440 
ended up cutting a dragging piece and
right<00:01:09.750> here<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.110> just<00:01:10.520> pocketing<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:11.700> into

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
right here and just pocketing that into

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.969 
right here and just pocketing that into
the<00:01:12.540> spot<00:01:12.780> where<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.110> rot<00:01:13.290> was<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.799> that<00:01:13.890> was

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
the spot where the rot was and that was

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.090 
the spot where the rot was and that was
the<00:01:14.100> only<00:01:14.220> bad<00:01:14.850> spot<00:01:15.330> in<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.479> plank<00:01:15.950> you'd<00:01:16.950> see

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
the only bad spot in a plank you'd see

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.649 
the only bad spot in a plank you'd see
the<00:01:17.220> oil<00:01:17.250> soaked<00:01:17.759> through<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.060> planks<00:01:18.450> there

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
the oil soaked through the planks there

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.490 
the oil soaked through the planks there
with<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.439> engine<00:01:19.740> set<00:01:20.810> my<00:01:21.810> dad<00:01:22.020> just<00:01:22.170> cleaning

which has the consistency of I'd say

fuel oil it's like painting few oil
you'll<00:01:41.040> lie<00:01:41.220> on<00:01:41.400> there<00:01:42.439> about<00:01:43.439> that<00:01:43.649> viscosity

you<00:01:45.600> see<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:45.899> goes<00:01:46.049> down<00:01:46.259> pretty<00:01:46.500> wet<00:01:46.740> here

you see it goes down pretty wet here
their<00:01:49.170> idea<00:01:49.470> is<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:50.509> preserve<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.570> planking

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
their idea is to preserve the planking

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.920 
their idea is to preserve the planking
after<00:01:52.530> we<00:01:52.590> got<00:01:52.710> down<00:01:52.920> through<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.159> paint

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
after we got down through the paint

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.060 
after we got down through the paint
planks<00:01:54.930> looks<00:01:55.110> so<00:01:55.259> nice<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:55.680> we<00:01:55.770> thought<00:01:55.920> we

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
planks looks so nice that we thought we

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.340 
planks looks so nice that we thought we
could<00:01:56.219> just<00:01:56.250> preserve<00:01:56.700> them<00:01:56.939> with<00:01:57.350> the

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
could just preserve them with the

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.030 
could just preserve them with the
penetrating<00:01:58.770> epoxy<00:01:59.369> stabilize<00:02:00.240> them<00:02:00.540> and

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
penetrating epoxy stabilize them and

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
picture of what it looks like after we

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.830 
picture of what it looks like after we
filled<00:02:50.409> the<00:02:50.530> seams<00:02:50.829> with<00:02:51.069> 5,200<00:02:51.819> dad<00:02:52.569> went

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
filled the seams with 5,200 dad went

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.740 
filled the seams with 5,200 dad went
through<00:02:52.900> and<00:02:53.519> laid<00:02:54.519> the<00:02:54.609> 5200<00:02:55.299> deep<00:02:55.480> in<00:02:55.629> the

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
through and laid the 5200 deep in the

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.170 
through and laid the 5200 deep in the
seams<00:02:55.989> so<00:02:56.109> it<00:02:56.260> was<00:02:56.349> down<00:02:56.530> inside<00:02:57.400> the<00:02:57.579> seam<00:02:57.790> so

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
seams so it was down inside the seam so

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.300 
seams so it was down inside the seam so
there<00:02:58.329> was<00:02:58.419> room<00:02:58.629> for<00:02:58.659> expansion<00:02:59.230> we<00:03:00.159> just

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
there was room for expansion we just

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.509 
there was room for expansion we just
wanted<00:03:00.489> to<00:03:00.549> seal<00:03:00.819> the<00:03:01.379> seam<00:03:02.379> at<00:03:02.680> the<00:03:02.799> bottom<00:03:03.189> or

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
wanted to seal the seam at the bottom or

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.099 
wanted to seal the seam at the bottom or
just<00:03:04.150> so<00:03:04.239> that<00:03:04.389> we<00:03:04.450> didn't<00:03:04.629> have<00:03:04.750> water<00:03:04.900> coming

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:05.109 
just so that we didn't have water coming

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:10.050 
just so that we didn't have water coming
up<00:03:05.290> through<00:03:05.349> immediately<00:03:07.560> and<00:03:08.560> then<00:03:09.400> a<00:03:09.760> coat

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060
