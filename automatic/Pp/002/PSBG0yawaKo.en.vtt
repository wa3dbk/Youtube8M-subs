00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
floor and put a layer of insulation you

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.709 
floor and put a layer of insulation you
can<00:00:34.350> see<00:00:34.590> here<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.700> guys<00:00:36.059> are<00:00:36.450> putting

heating<00:00:37.320> pipes<00:00:37.649> in<00:00:38.040> before<00:00:38.700> you<00:00:38.879> put<00:00:39.180> heating

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
heating pipes in before you put heating

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.900 
heating pipes in before you put heating
pipes<00:00:39.840> you<00:00:40.140> must<00:00:40.440> first<00:00:40.860> insulate<00:00:41.550> so<00:00:41.790> we

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
pipes you must first insulate so we

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.690 
pipes you must first insulate so we
don't<00:00:42.120> lose<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:43.230> heat<00:00:43.559> going<00:00:44.129> out<00:00:44.280> into<00:00:44.489> the

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
don't lose the heat going out into the

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.170 
don't lose the heat going out into the
ground<00:00:45.559> in<00:00:46.559> order<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:47.010> place<00:00:47.250> those<00:00:47.520> pipes<00:00:47.879> we

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
ground in order to place those pipes we

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.690 
ground in order to place those pipes we
need<00:00:48.390> something<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:48.899> tie<00:00:49.230> them<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.100> so<00:00:50.460> we

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
need something to tie them to and so we

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.410 
need something to tie them to and so we
put<00:00:51.000> down<00:00:51.300> plaza<00:00:52.309> reinforcing<00:00:53.309> steel<00:00:54.090> which

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
put down plaza reinforcing steel which

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.420 
put down plaza reinforcing steel which
will<00:00:54.660> add<00:00:54.809> some<00:00:55.110> strength<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.860> concrete

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
will add some strength to the concrete

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.810 
will add some strength to the concrete
and<00:00:56.760> will<00:00:57.660> also<00:00:58.079> give<00:00:58.289> us<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.590> place<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:58.890> fasten

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
and will also give us a place to fasten

first of all energy efficiency is very
important<00:02:13.250> as<00:02:13.520> the<00:02:13.819> cost<00:02:14.090> of<00:02:14.330> utilities

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
important as the cost of utilities

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.780 
important as the cost of utilities
increase<00:02:15.440> we<00:02:15.800> must<00:02:16.069> think<00:02:16.310> more<00:02:16.610> about

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
increase we must think more about

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.020 
increase we must think more about
building<00:02:17.360> houses<00:02:18.430> ecological<00:02:19.430> not<00:02:19.700> just

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
building houses ecological not just

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.090 
building houses ecological not just
economic<00:02:20.810> role<00:02:21.050> and<00:02:21.319> efficient<00:02:21.920> but

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
economic role and efficient but

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.060 
economic role and efficient but
ecological<00:02:22.970> so<00:02:23.120> we're<00:02:23.270> not<00:02:23.420> wasting<00:02:23.720> Heat<00:02:24.230> now

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
ecological so we're not wasting Heat now

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:26.980

if<00:02:25.280> we<00:02:25.430> don't<00:02:25.640> put<00:02:25.880> insulation<00:02:26.570> under<00:02:26.840> that

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
if we don't put insulation under that

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.260 
if we don't put insulation under that
floor<00:02:27.350> we're<00:02:27.620> losing<00:02:27.980> about<00:02:28.100> 25<00:02:28.700> percent<00:02:29.180> of

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
our heat down through the floor and so

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.699 
our heat down through the floor and so
that's<00:02:32.060> a<00:02:32.209> big<00:02:32.240> expense<00:02:32.930> to<00:02:33.140> add<00:02:33.290> the

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
insulation under the floor why we put

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.650
