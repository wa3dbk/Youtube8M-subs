comfortable on the bike and getting that
lean<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.450> bigger<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.870> whip<00:00:15.990> you<00:00:16.109> do<00:00:16.260> all

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
people are always trying to do these

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.370 
people are always trying to do these
crazy<00:00:23.279> out<00:00:24.119> of<00:00:24.150> control<00:00:24.269> things<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.140> just

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
crazy out of control things and just

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.830 
crazy out of control things and just
like<00:00:25.640> let<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.760> bike<00:00:26.910> do<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.210> work<00:00:27.359> lean<00:00:27.630> over

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
like let the bike do the work lean over

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.130 
like let the bike do the work lean over
and<00:00:29.000> it's<00:00:30.000> going<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.240> go<00:00:30.359> out<00:00:30.480> there<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:30.869> when

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
and it's going to go out there and when

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.959 
and it's going to go out there and when
it<00:00:31.230> goes<00:00:31.349> out<00:00:31.500> there<00:00:31.740> don't<00:00:31.920> panic<00:00:32.250> because

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
it goes out there don't panic because

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:33.860 
it goes out there don't panic because
it's<00:00:33.120> going<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.300> come<00:00:33.420> back

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
it's going to come back

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.530 
it's going to come back
you<00:00:34.230> got<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.530> quick<00:00:34.770> short<00:00:35.460> lift<00:00:35.700> we're<00:00:36.239> just

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
you got the quick short lift we're just

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.920 
you got the quick short lift we're just
like<00:00:36.719> real<00:00:36.989> twitchy<00:00:37.380> movement<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.930> that's

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
like real twitchy movement and that's

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.600 
like real twitchy movement and that's
usually<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.350> most<00:00:40.530> effective<00:00:41.010> honestly<00:00:41.460> and

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
usually the most effective honestly and

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.889 
usually the most effective honestly and
then<00:00:41.700> you<00:00:41.790> kind<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.090> have<00:00:42.210> like<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.540> Bogle

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
then you kind of have like the Bogle

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.950 
then you kind of have like the Bogle
shrubs<00:00:43.710> which<00:00:44.489> aren't<00:00:44.940> quite<00:00:45.329> as<00:00:45.480> effective

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
shrubs which aren't quite as effective

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.569 
shrubs which aren't quite as effective
but<00:00:46.170> they<00:00:46.289> look<00:00:46.469> really<00:00:46.620> cool<00:00:46.890> that's<00:00:47.340> more

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
but they look really cool that's more

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.540 
but they look really cool that's more
like<00:00:47.820> you<00:00:47.969> float<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.239> jump<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:49.250> you<00:00:50.250> kind<00:00:50.489> of

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
like you float the jump and you kind of

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.880 
like you float the jump and you kind of
twist<00:00:50.910> it<00:00:51.090> in<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.360> air<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.780> real<00:00:52.350> effective

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
twist it in the air a real effective

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.680 
twist it in the air a real effective
scrub<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.489> want<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.789> all<00:00:54.120> done<00:00:54.480> on<00:00:54.600> the

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
scrub is you want it all done on the

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.529 
scrub is you want it all done on the
face<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.989> jump<00:00:55.199> everything<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:56.210> you<00:00:57.210> just<00:00:57.360> get

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
face to jump everything and you just get

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.389 
face to jump everything and you just get
that<00:00:57.660> bike<00:00:57.899> leaned<00:00:58.469> over<00:00:58.620> as<00:00:58.829> far<00:00:58.980> as<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.160> can

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
that bike leaned over as far as you can

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.330 
that bike leaned over as far as you can
and<00:00:59.699> just<00:01:00.469> let<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.590> loop<00:01:01.770> let<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.190> wheel

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
and just let the loop let the wheel

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.520 
and just let the loop let the wheel
slide<00:01:02.640> just<00:01:03.539> like<00:01:03.629> any<00:01:03.840> other<00:01:04.019> jump<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:04.409> mean

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
slide just like any other jump I mean

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.660 
slide just like any other jump I mean
you're<00:01:04.650> looking<00:01:04.769> ahead<00:01:04.979> you're<00:01:05.250> not<00:01:05.400> worried

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
you're looking ahead you're not worried

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.990 
you're looking ahead you're not worried
about<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.939> takeoff<00:01:06.299> just<00:01:07.580> do<00:01:08.580> what<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:08.850> got

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
about the takeoff just do what you got

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.580 
about the takeoff just do what you got
to<00:01:09.030> do<00:01:09.210> on<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.450> face<00:01:09.630> of<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.869> jump<00:01:09.900> but<00:01:10.439> don't

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
to do on the face of the jump but don't

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.410 
to do on the face of the jump but don't
sit<00:01:10.830> there<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.070> stare<00:01:11.400> at<00:01:11.549> it<00:01:11.580> or<00:01:11.820> else<00:01:11.909> you're

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
sit there and stare at it or else you're

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.789 
sit there and stare at it or else you're
probably<00:01:12.900> going<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.260> either<00:01:13.350> case<00:01:13.619> or

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
probably going to either case or

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:14.750 
probably going to either case or
overshoot<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.220> jump<00:01:14.430> because<00:01:14.520> you're<00:01:14.670> going

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
overshoot the jump because you're going

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.850 
overshoot the jump because you're going
to<00:01:14.820> be<00:01:14.909> so<00:01:15.060> worried<00:01:15.299> about<00:01:15.619> trying<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.740> get

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
to be so worried about trying to get

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.039 
to be so worried about trying to get
that<00:01:17.009> bike<00:01:17.189> leaned<00:01:17.460> over<00:01:17.580> another<00:01:18.479> thing<00:01:18.810> if

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
that bike leaned over another thing if

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.570 
that bike leaned over another thing if
you're<00:01:19.290> really<00:01:19.680> doing<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:20.040> good<00:01:20.130> scrub<00:01:20.430> you

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
you're really doing a good scrub you

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.700 
you're really doing a good scrub you
should<00:01:20.759> be<00:01:20.850> able<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.000> hit<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.210> jump<00:01:21.680> weight<00:01:22.680> a

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
should be able to hit the jump weight a

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.359 
should be able to hit the jump weight a
bit<00:01:22.860> faster<00:01:23.340> than<00:01:24.140> before<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:26.189> more

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
bit faster than before and the more

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.560 
bit faster than before and the more
comfortable<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:26.909> get<00:01:27.000> with<00:01:27.060> scrubbing<00:01:27.479> the

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
comfortable you get with scrubbing the

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:28.940 
comfortable you get with scrubbing the
faster<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:28.049> can<00:01:28.140> hit<00:01:28.229> that<00:01:28.409> jump<00:01:28.650> which<00:01:28.920> is

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
faster you can hit that jump which is

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.970 
faster you can hit that jump which is
the<00:01:29.159> whole<00:01:29.280> point<00:01:29.549> of<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.700> scrub
