 it would be annoying to laguna seca we always welcome plenty of people 

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:32.560
 with us all weekends so tonight it's true that I've always been 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.180
 bathed a little bit dangerous 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.570

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.820
 round table my grandma is so had lots of kids and a lot of 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:41.920
 little children 6 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.800
 which means that each family meal was about thirty or so 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.190
 so at table it was all the time for a hundred and a whole expedition 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.130
 conducted and they were 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.130
 I always bathed in his studio is a little bit 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.039

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:01.830
 did the hotel school had the whole hotel yesterday exhausted 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.620
 there I shot in different houses and castles 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.190
 Michelin star since 2002 I am a rotten he added this year with 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.359
 thierry marx one of the wells from the beginning 

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:13.359
 the 2011 when I took the head of the restaurant and 

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:17.209
 but percent and all today everything is fine the customers are are very 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:18.899
 I was changed a little bit 

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:21.699
 in e the state of mind of the motorcycle accused when we put a little time 

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:26.059
 the lead and molecular aside because I absolutely did not want to continue 

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:28.000
 in this sense in this sense 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.549
 in this context because it was really the most atypical and march 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:34.379
 today it was several holders it was more classic 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.390
 traditional in any case it's a kitchen that suits me thÃ©rÃ¨se com 

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:40.539
 and kisses getting married% em 

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:43.729

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:45.279
 dabbed or other 

00:02:45.279 --> 00:02:49.139
 e for security greedy who is sharing around a good bottle I 

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:51.639
 believe that today do not ask too much questions on the subject 

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:54.469
 what to do what do we have to do we are in 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:56.959
 we learn to sing it in an establishment that is 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.219
 I still have luxury health 

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:02.019
 it is necessary today thÃ¼r 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.719
 to have fun and I think that in this sense by having fun by putting 

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:08.639
 the soul and heart in what we do we can give only pleasure to the customer 

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:11.939
 and loosen the coat up 

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:14.939
 my ambition today at the apple is make you happy 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.179
 it gives pleasure with the inter clients and phone calls do not especially I do not 

00:03:20.179 --> 00:03:21.129
 know what I mean 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:25.249
 it is necessary to preserve his master exactly me alone today I am not very 

00:03:25.249 --> 00:03:28.499
 far because there are still people in the kitchen who are who are 

00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:31.739
 the mansion on the ground Wednesday to Sunday 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.749

00:03:35.749 --> 00:03:39.039
 mix mouth meat fish and awards his nerves and the team 

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:41.349
 This is it's a family 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:44.529

00:03:44.529 --> 00:03:48.039

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.430
 while tonight we go to hell I left - on a freshness I understand 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.099
 so it's a little bit 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:58.109
 it's a little bit we'll say 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:01.579
 e questionable with the problems that right now but I still think 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:05.709
 also bringing not to share because there were problems with his 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:06.209
