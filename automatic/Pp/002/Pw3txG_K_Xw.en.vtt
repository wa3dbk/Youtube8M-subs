00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 thanks to betrayal obviously the 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.390
 betrayal hurts when you love someone to 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:11.700
 our friends love each other of course 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:13.469
 and friends friends there is that you have to 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.470
 differentiate for your child this is not what 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.420
 because sometimes it is that I say 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.970
 betrayed such a person and it hurts us a lot 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.199
 it was a well known perate and also we 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.420
 it's gone that suddenly 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.490
 someone stops talking to you and a lot happens 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.939
 time and that tells you you send message 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.369
 you call him you call him and he does not answer you and 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.130
 Suddenly the time passes is that it's me 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.870
 They said that you had commented something 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.460
 they are not friends I say if they left you 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:44.280
 speak if by a gossip rumor of that what 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.930
 they believed he hears when someone tells you look 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.910
 I'm going to tell you something about him but swear to me 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.399
 that you do not serve anyone and do not tell them 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.360
 I was not no, not the one who is a friend, I dance in 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.360
 in front of peratta 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:01.730
 that there is clear and speaking for the rumor 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:02.720
 Well, it 's your acquaintance 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.390
 they are friends 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.580
 benjamin franklin said he was very slow 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.520
 to choose a friend but I also know 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.050
 much slower to leave it this is 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.700
 very important if I want to do 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.710
 Some recommendation is the first 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.160
 you just said well said friend 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.330
 known I'm not going to give you the title of 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.000
 friend to someone who simple and 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:26.360
 he is simply manifesting his 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.009
 friendship with flattery or with betrayal or 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.610
 with murmuring the true friends 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:33.920
 who believe they know about you they recognize you 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.470
 they can come loves you to take care of 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.210
 reputation when you are not you can 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.070
 get to say today wait wait for me 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.259
 we hope something you're talking about 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.780
 she apologizes but what I know is 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:45.920
 what a good changer excellent mom if not 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.490
 I like your comment 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:53.060
 these are friends but I seriously was that 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:55.460
 I did not know about her that please if I have 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.480
 they stay quiet clear and silence 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.080
 grants 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:02.270
 that was very strong does not go after a 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.040
 second one analyzes the betrayal first that 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.020
 nothing careful to fall into something that I 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.290
 I say or that a Spanish author put him 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.420
 terrible it is what is that today is simple 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:13.490
 and you just found out that someone 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.260
 is talking to a friend said something to 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.420
 see to see to see do not do it so terrible 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.060
 first face it and say it and it's true 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.520
 this can now be a subtle comment 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.610
 misunderstood someone who added him 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.100
 from his harvest to a point a coma changes 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.320
 everything we are very careful with that what 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.330
 reason if that person warned me because the 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.010
 Hotel traditional friend or let's start 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.170
 to see that he starts talking to me or making you 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.200
 hurtful comments is warning you 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:42.970
 that is not to be trusted 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:45.280
 but it 's worth keeping that friendship 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.260
 I say if you already realized that it was not 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.440
 one was not two were not three already go 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.970
 five times and also as the person 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.129
 I did not even show you friendship 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.170
 how is it worth it that I follow and that 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:58.750
 I continue to miss that friendship at hand 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.160
 purchase garbage is recycled what follows the 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.900
 standing water stinks you go back 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.790
 there are no people that are not worth it 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.880
 devote more time fourth please 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.620
 learn the lesson by name learn the 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.360
 lesson is very important when 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.610
 person learns the lesson 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.310
 simply and simply realize that 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:18.370
 that he should no longer be so confident that 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.980
 closed mouth do not enter flies that to 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.829
 Sometimes people are not so trustworthy 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.630
 as I believe please if not 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:28.209
 you learned the lesson and you keep opening 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.950
 your sacred center to everyone you go 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.549
 to give the lesson again life 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.549
 That you learn 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.280
 varied 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:42.480
 and the last one as I said a not better said 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.720
 the boy of eight 'said it in his series 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:49.040
 but revenge is never good kill the 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.040
 soul and poison 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.270
 revenge nothing is good at nothing kills 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.160
 the soul and poison it if you try 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.470
 revenge lady because the comadre said 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:03.150
 because her sister -in- law tell you the 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:05.310
 you're messing up you're in those people 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.340
 we enter the frequency of the 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.750
 I explain negativity I think 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.460
 the phrase matona of today is going to 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.280
 to arrive as a finger ring I tell them to 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:17.760
 leave your voucher to the volume of your 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:20.310
 television because your betrayal hurts my 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.830
 blindness sorry but you know that 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:25.080
 learning strengthens me by no 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.330
 motive to hold the grudge for your betrayal 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.220
 because as I said a moment ago the 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.890
 standing water stinks in the trash is 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:36.740

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:45.660
 they are worse and love and friendship 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:51.319
 born with a look grow in a 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:51.319
 illusion and die in a betrayal 

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:58.010
 I already got the actor 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.010

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:14.760
 on the street every day in front of 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:16.500
 this is that please we will not have 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.540
 our heart do not do not open our 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.490

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.590
 that you value there are comments that we 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.760
 must save for you there are moments in 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.169
 the life in which we have to 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:30.210
 differentiate between what is friend and 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:31.860
 known so not all 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:34.800

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.850
 head and to each head is a world and in

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:43.050
 what you say is that I do not deserve it 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.120
