a lay off pass when to use the lay off

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.970 
a lay off pass when to use the lay off
pass<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:18.449> all<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.170> different<00:00:19.439> types<00:00:19.619> of<00:00:19.800> lay

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
pass and all the different types of lay

off<00:00:20.070> passes<00:00:20.550> there<00:00:20.760> are<00:00:20.880> in<00:00:21.449> this<00:00:21.630> video<00:00:21.960> I'll

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
off passes there are in this video I'll

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.960 
off passes there are in this video I'll
do<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.560> lot<00:00:22.710> of<00:00:22.740> shots<00:00:22.949> early<00:00:23.460> when<00:00:23.730> I<00:00:23.760> could

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
do a lot of shots early when I could

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.550 
do a lot of shots early when I could
have<00:00:24.060> just<00:00:24.210> run<00:00:24.359> on<00:00:24.480> them<00:00:24.660> probably<00:00:25.170> scored

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
have just run on them probably scored

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.320 
have just run on them probably scored
but<00:00:26.070> it's<00:00:26.220> just<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.519> give<00:00:26.699> you<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:26.880> general<00:00:27.300> idea

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
but it's just to give you a general idea

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.660 
but it's just to give you a general idea
like<00:00:28.199> when<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.740> lay<00:00:28.859> off<00:00:28.949> passed<00:00:29.250> was<00:00:29.460> done

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
like when the lay off passed was done

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.609 
like when the lay off passed was done
kind<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.060> thing<00:00:30.269> there<00:00:30.660> are<00:00:30.810> more<00:00:31.349> effective

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
kind of thing there are more effective

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.139 
kind of thing there are more effective
than<00:00:31.859> what<00:00:32.099> I'm<00:00:32.219> doing<00:00:32.250> in<00:00:32.610> this<00:00:32.700> video

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
than what I'm doing in this video

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.060 
than what I'm doing in this video
because<00:00:33.690> I<00:00:33.899> wouldn't<00:00:34.260> be<00:00:34.320> shooting<00:00:34.590> straight

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
because I wouldn't be shooting straight

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.610 
because I wouldn't be shooting straight
away<00:00:35.460> first<00:00:35.820> time<00:00:36.120> every<00:00:36.540> time<00:00:36.750> someone<00:00:37.079> for

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
away first time every time someone for

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.100 
away first time every time someone for
the<00:00:37.680> lay<00:00:37.860> off<00:00:37.920> pass<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.399> me<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.760> layoff<00:00:39.420> pass<00:00:39.780> is

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
the lay off pass to me a layoff pass is

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.040 
the lay off pass to me a layoff pass is
done<00:00:40.410> with<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:41.309> three-ball<00:00:41.879> button<00:00:42.270> so<00:00:42.540> why

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
done with the three-ball button so why

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.369 
done with the three-ball button so why
for<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.410> Xbox<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.100> triangle<00:00:44.700> for<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.910> ps3

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379 
for the Xbox and triangle for the ps3

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:47.840 
for the Xbox and triangle for the ps3
but<00:00:46.379> it<00:00:46.530> becomes<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.070> layer<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.370> pass<00:00:47.579> when

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
but it becomes a layer of pass when

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.069 
but it becomes a layer of pass when
you're<00:00:48.000> in<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.149> tacking<00:00:48.570> area<00:00:48.809> so<00:00:48.930> the

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
you're in the tacking area so the

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.069 
you're in the tacking area so the
attacking<00:00:49.440> cast<00:00:49.800> of<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.010> pitch<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.550> you<00:00:51.420> you

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
attacking cast of the pitch and you you

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.220 
attacking cast of the pitch and you you
pressed<00:00:52.410> Y<00:00:52.739> or<00:00:53.010> triangle<00:00:53.750> sideways<00:00:54.750> backwards

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
pressed Y or triangle sideways backwards

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.779 
pressed Y or triangle sideways backwards
or<00:00:56.129> slightly<00:00:57.059> forward<00:00:57.600> so<00:00:57.809> just<00:00:57.840> not<00:00:58.789> directly

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
or slightly forward so just not directly

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.340 
or slightly forward so just not directly
for<00:01:00.120> words<00:01:00.300> but<00:01:00.510> just<00:01:00.570> ever<00:01:01.050> so<00:01:01.320> slightly

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
for words but just ever so slightly

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.650 
for words but just ever so slightly
forwards<00:01:02.309> lay<00:01:02.670> off<00:01:02.789> passes<00:01:03.239> I<00:01:03.329> don't<00:01:03.510> really

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
forwards lay off passes I don't really

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.600 
forwards lay off passes I don't really
see<00:01:03.930> in<00:01:04.049> pro<00:01:04.229> clubs<00:01:04.500> that<00:01:04.650> much<00:01:04.890> but<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.549> think

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
see in pro clubs that much but I think

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.000 
see in pro clubs that much but I think
they're<00:01:06.000> very<00:01:06.060> effective<00:01:06.689> especially<00:01:07.590> in

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
they're very effective especially in

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.609 
they're very effective especially in
this<00:01:08.159> FIFA<00:01:08.640> which<00:01:08.880> if<00:01:09.210> you've<00:01:09.990> noticed<00:01:10.229> when

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
this FIFA which if you've noticed when

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.380 
this FIFA which if you've noticed when
you<00:01:10.740> especially<00:01:11.280> when<00:01:11.400> you're<00:01:11.520> sprinting<00:01:11.790> if

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
you especially when you're sprinting if

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.630 
you especially when you're sprinting if
you<00:01:12.659> try<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.049> shoot<00:01:13.260> your<00:01:13.470> guy<00:01:13.650> has<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.070> take

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
you try and shoot your guy has to take

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.399 
you try and shoot your guy has to take
another<00:01:14.909> step<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.540> set<00:01:15.720> himself<00:01:16.049> before<00:01:16.200> he

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
another step to set himself before he

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.890 
another step to set himself before he
can<00:01:16.439> shoot<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.790> lay<00:01:17.970> off<00:01:18.119> pass<00:01:18.390> just<00:01:18.720> gets

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
can shoot and a lay off pass just gets

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.620 
can shoot and a lay off pass just gets
rid<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.290> because<00:01:20.100> when<00:01:20.610> someone<00:01:21.030> does<00:01:21.600> a

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
rid of that because when someone does a

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.170 
rid of that because when someone does a
lay<00:01:21.869> off<00:01:21.990> party<00:01:22.530> your<00:01:23.130> guys<00:01:23.310> sets<00:01:23.640> yourself<00:01:24.030> up

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
lay off party your guys sets yourself up

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.120 
lay off party your guys sets yourself up
on<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.479> run<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.470> by<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.650> time<00:01:25.770> he's

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
on the run so that by the time he's

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.410 
on the run so that by the time he's
about<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.460> kick<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.640> ball<00:01:26.759> he's<00:01:27.000> already<00:01:27.180> set

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
about to kick the ball he's already set

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.940 
about to kick the ball he's already set
himself<00:01:27.540> well<00:01:27.869> if<00:01:28.170> you're<00:01:28.350> trying<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.650> get<00:01:28.740> lay

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
himself well if you're trying to get lay

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.800 
himself well if you're trying to get lay
off<00:01:29.070> passes<00:01:29.549> for<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.850> accomplishments<00:01:30.630> on

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
off passes for the accomplishments on

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.109 
off passes for the accomplishments on
the<00:01:31.259> passing<00:01:31.950> accomplishments<00:01:32.640> or<00:01:32.820> the

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
the passing accomplishments or the

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.999 
the passing accomplishments or the
mental<00:01:33.509> accomplishment<00:01:34.110> I<00:01:34.229> would<00:01:34.500> suggest<00:01:34.650> to

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
mental accomplishment I would suggest to

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.830 
mental accomplishment I would suggest to
try<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.340> do<00:01:35.430> tapper<00:01:35.790> crosses<00:01:36.270> with<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.689> lay

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
try and do tapper crosses with the lay

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.270 
try and do tapper crosses with the lay
off<00:01:36.960> pass<00:01:37.200> so<00:01:37.409> that's<00:01:37.590> probably<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.979> easiest

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
off pass so that's probably the easiest

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.100 
off pass so that's probably the easiest
way<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.520> score<00:01:39.030> if<00:01:39.450> you're<00:01:39.659> trying<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.930> get<00:01:39.990> the

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
way to score if you're trying to get the

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.109 
way to score if you're trying to get the
mental<00:01:40.500> accomplishments<00:01:41.250> which<00:01:41.460> are<00:01:41.700> layoffs

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
mental accomplishments which are layoffs

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.240 
mental accomplishments which are layoffs
with<00:01:42.329> midfielder<00:01:42.960> I<00:01:43.140> would<00:01:43.530> suggest<00:01:43.740> doing

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
with midfielder I would suggest doing

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.100 
with midfielder I would suggest doing
the<00:01:44.520> accomplishment<00:01:45.119> trick<00:01:45.360> from<00:01:45.630> my<00:01:45.899> other

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
the accomplishment trick from my other

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.770 
the accomplishment trick from my other

and just be careful crosses with the lay

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.030 
and just be careful crosses with the lay
off<00:01:54.030> boss<00:01:54.270> also<00:01:55.229> if<00:01:55.500> you're<00:01:55.710> in<00:01:55.920> the

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
off boss also if you're in the

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.859 
off boss also if you're in the
opportunity<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.670> do<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:56.850> tap<00:01:57.149> across<00:01:57.509> I<00:01:57.750> would

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
opportunity to do a tap across I would

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.510 
opportunity to do a tap across I would
suggest<00:01:58.020> doing<00:01:58.229> a<00:01:58.469> lay<00:01:58.619> off<00:01:58.740> pass<00:01:58.979> any<00:01:59.280> way

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
suggest doing a lay off pass any way

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.870 
suggest doing a lay off pass any way
over<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.210> passing<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.780> ball<00:02:00.960> with<00:02:01.200> aox

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
over and passing the ball with aox

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.920 
over and passing the ball with aox
because<00:02:02.880> when<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.210> pass<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.450> ball<00:02:03.600> with<00:02:03.780> our

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
because when you pass the ball with our

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.260 
because when you pass the ball with our
extra<00:02:04.409> passing<00:02:04.950> it<00:02:05.040> directly<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.640> them<00:02:05.850> to

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
extra passing it directly to them to

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.889 
extra passing it directly to them to
their<00:02:06.450> feet

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
their feet

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.740 
their feet
whereas<00:02:07.590> doing<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:08.039> low<00:02:08.190> pass<00:02:08.550> gives<00:02:09.450> them<00:02:09.569> time

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
whereas doing a low pass gives them time

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.839 
whereas doing a low pass gives them time
to<00:02:09.959> set<00:02:10.140> themselves<00:02:10.289> up<00:02:10.709> you'll<00:02:11.370> notice<00:02:11.520> when

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
to set themselves up you'll notice when

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.400 
to set themselves up you'll notice when
you<00:02:11.879> press<00:02:12.180> a<00:02:12.420> or<00:02:12.930> air

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
you press a or air

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.650 
you press a or air
so<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:13.980> player<00:02:14.190> may<00:02:14.430> sky<00:02:14.760> over<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.150> bar<00:02:15.420> and

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
so the player may sky over the bar and

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.480 
so the player may sky over the bar and
that's<00:02:16.020> literally<00:02:16.410> just<00:02:16.680> down<00:02:16.890> to<00:02:17.130> the<00:02:17.250> fact

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
that's literally just down to the fact

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.610 
that's literally just down to the fact
that<00:02:17.630> even<00:02:18.630> though<00:02:18.720> it<00:02:18.810> doesn't<00:02:19.050> maybe<00:02:19.320> look

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
that even though it doesn't maybe look

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.620 
that even though it doesn't maybe look
like<00:02:19.770> on<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.040> pitch<00:02:20.250> but<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:21.210> ball<00:02:21.420> is<00:02:21.450> in

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
like on the pitch but the ball is in

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.450 
like on the pitch but the ball is in
your<00:02:21.840> players<00:02:22.050> feet<00:02:22.440> so<00:02:22.740> he's<00:02:22.860> not<00:02:23.040> set

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
your players feet so he's not set

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.460 
your players feet so he's not set
properly<00:02:23.940> to<00:02:24.180> take<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:24.510> shot<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:25.140> that's<00:02:25.320> why

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
properly to take the shot and that's why

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.500 
properly to take the shot and that's why
skies<00:02:25.800> that<00:02:26.010> over<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.280> bar<00:02:26.490> whereas<00:02:27.270> if<00:02:27.390> you

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
skies that over the bar whereas if you

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.660 
skies that over the bar whereas if you
do<00:02:27.630> a<00:02:27.660> layoff<00:02:27.930> you<00:02:28.440> got<00:02:28.620> more<00:02:28.920> time<00:02:29.190> to<00:02:29.460> set

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
do a layoff you got more time to set

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.060 
do a layoff you got more time to set
yourself<00:02:30.060> and<00:02:30.270> this<00:02:30.720> is<00:02:30.870> my<00:02:31.050> video<00:02:31.260> I<00:02:31.620> hope<00:02:31.680> you
