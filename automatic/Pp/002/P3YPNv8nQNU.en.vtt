00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
got an iPhone here what you can do now

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.390 
got an iPhone here what you can do now
is<00:01:27.150> you<00:01:27.360> can<00:01:27.509> now<00:01:27.720> plug<00:01:28.170> it<00:01:28.350> into<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:29.490> cable

is you can now plug it into the cable
which<00:01:32.400> is<00:01:32.430> just<00:01:32.850> here

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.100 

so<00:01:46.580> there<00:01:46.820> we<00:01:46.910> go<00:01:46.940> that's<00:01:47.300> all<00:01:47.540> connected<00:01:48.020> up

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
so there we go that's all connected up

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:54.820 
so there we go that's all connected up
now<00:01:53.650> connected

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
now connected

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.240 
now connected
suppose<00:01:55.550> the<00:01:55.670> glovebox<00:01:55.940> and<00:01:56.920> now<00:01:57.920> all<00:01:58.100> the

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
suppose the glovebox and now all the

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.530 
suppose the glovebox and now all the
operations<00:01:58.760> can<00:01:59.030> now<00:01:59.180> come<00:01:59.390> off<00:01:59.540> the<00:02:01.540> motor

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
operations can now come off the motor

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.760 
operations can now come off the motor
roller<00:02:04.960> it's<00:02:05.960> still<00:02:06.229> downloading<00:02:06.710> the

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
roller it's still downloading the

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.430 
roller it's still downloading the
phonebook

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
phonebook

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.749 
phonebook
so<00:02:09.440> we'll<00:02:09.590> just<00:02:09.740> go<00:02:09.890> into<00:02:10.009> recent<00:02:10.399> course<00:02:10.580> so

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759
