00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:07.380
 how many of you have gone for your lives 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:11.340
 and they can recognize in their lives 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:14.059
 a moment the defining moment in which 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.059
 your life changed 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.210
 instead of going to a single person the 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:21.610
 blessing of the firstborn was split 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.590
 between two one was sharp he received the 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:27.279
 monarchy and priestly blessing and the 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:29.439
 double portion went towards jose this was going 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.509
 to be prophetic of something that was going to 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:34.000
 happen later when the kingdom of 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:36.430
 israel was separated into two first of 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.340
 kings 11 chapter 31 and biguÃ¡ jeroboam 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:42.370
 Take 10 pieces for you because it says so 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.860
 the lord god of israel here is to start 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.379
 the kingdom of the hand of Solomon and I will give you 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.609
 to you ten tribes this was going to be the 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.010
 first indication of something 

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:53.050
 incredibly prophetic that he was going to 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.829
 connect again with the blessing that 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.829
 it was split in two 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.330
 and continues to say also Mr. 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.010
 will scatter among all the peoples of a 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.230
 end of the earth to the other 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.630
 end of the earth and there you will serve 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:13.330
 other gods of wood and stone that 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.330
 neither you and your parents have known 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:24.210
 and take out the dan and you're the potters 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:27.180
 all the other tribes where they are not 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.250
 exist today because they never came back from 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.660
 his captivity how many tribes were in 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.760
 the base of the Sinai mountain when the 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.979
 commandments were given 12 but 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.530
 literally only the house of Judah exists 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.650
 today that's why Israel is connected 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.570
 with the Jewish people then for their 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.580
 constant disobedience the kingdom of 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.050
 north of the house of israel was brought 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.619
 in captivity by the king of Assyria 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.390
 during the 722 times they were assimilated between 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.460
 the nations and they were pushed to the 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.080
 four corners of the known world in 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.390
 that time they were eventually going to 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:01.240
 be the four corners of today's world 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.130
 efraim which now bears the blessing 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.640
 of the firstborn of the house of Israel 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:09.270
 It is prophesied to make a multitude of 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.270
 nations 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.940
 by generation from generation to generation 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:21.560
 in the northern kingdom of the house of 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:23.780
 israel never never returned 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.480
 the only reason why we have the 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.709
 Jewish people today is because the kingdom of 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.709
 south return 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.060
 the northern kingdom of the house of israel 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:37.459
 the fullness of the nations millions and 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.439
 millions of people have returned them on 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.480
 Lord to his land the prophecy more 

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:44.170
 significant that it has ever been 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.170
 delivered 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.329
 and I can not declare stronger than the 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.220
 man who has not yet recognized that 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:55.230
 the northern kingdom of the house of israel 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.450
 it's completely different from the people 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.239
 Jewish is still in childhood the 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:03.090
 mere biblical study alphabet and up 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:06.299
 this day the meaning of seven eighths 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:09.109
 of his bible is sealed to his 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:09.109
 understanding
