00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:04.740
 this site is not a simple kate mccann 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.480
 the same if he has under his hood one of two engines atmospheric 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.210
 the most powerful in the world montpellier on a series car 

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:19.560
 against 530 for me outdoor is a plastic magazine 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.069
 for 2014 exhaust pipe 

00:00:22.069 --> 00:00:25.640
 the words are for big wheels according to you that will soon 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:27.429
 but especially 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:30.429
 it's under the hood that's happening 

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:33.580
 I also present you 3 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:34.520
 aig 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.520
 510 horsepower designed with 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.930
 we can even see that this engine was not he was among those of all 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:45.510
 country 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.200
 so to the cadres of the nation 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.200
 I'm not the one to talk to 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.010
 more powerful more logical net profit of 430 the week engine does not have 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.469
 turbo 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:00.260
 he does not need it 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
 shortly before his death 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.470
 win with the blues 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:10.990
 the produced chain 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.990
 the fantastic ones 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.570
 for me not fast enough 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.950
 when to buy 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.950
 the paddles on the steering wheel 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.230
 the star of the brand at the apple 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.230
 the other opponents 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.070
 but I did not have to be part of this festival its 70 spring 2010 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.430
 now he has slightly modified 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:44.720
 it should pass 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.890
 you can send your file 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.890
 memory of 200 stores in the ballot boxes 

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:10.009
 dozens injured 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.179
 the cylinders the power course 

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:15.179
 but we have more power for me 

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:24.719
 the start was pushed back to the master I do with 

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:27.039
 the media revive 

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:30.039
 so for this booming part 

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:42.189
 the postponement of the date of account keeping quite the contrary 

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:47.309
 the good performance 

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:50.289
 very comfortable and safety 

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:53.289
 more mature its engines an exceptional purpose 

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:57.109
 for the knowledge 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:02:57.999
 it's a very moving moment
