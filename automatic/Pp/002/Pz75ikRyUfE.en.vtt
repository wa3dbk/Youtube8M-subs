 Hi, I'm the Gomez agent and today we're going to 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.120
 see how to configure the application that 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.140
 gel that comes standard on samsungs 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.140
 galaxy s 4 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.950
 While how to configure the application 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.689
 that gel that comes standard we have 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.300
 left over towards the cat and that will serve 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:21.880
 to help control the sport 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.560
 doing daily we enter the menu 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.660
 and we press s health 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.990
 in this case of the welcome we press 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.270
 in following they ask us to accept the 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.530
 terms of use 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.530
 what are 13 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.140
 click on next and we will 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:44.170
 request our profile we need 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.600
 give it a name, let's be quick 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:50.120
 a date of birth we are going to put 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:53.329
 For example, we are from the year 2000 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:57.910
 martÃ­nez if we are male or female too 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:01:00.880
 I was in height in 165 centimeters to 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:04.670
 a person of normal stature and a weight 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:06.830
 80 kilos 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.049
 and the type of activity the type of 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.409
 activity because we have many types 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:16.070
 since the little activity starts 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:18.140
 intense and here below we will indicate the 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.899
 objective of the daily intake of 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.710
 calories and the purpose of the loads that 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:24.430
 we see burn 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:27.229
 daily then click on start 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.810
 tells us that if we want to add the 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:31.320
 Additional functions in the settings 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.420
 let's accept 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.700
 and we already see a minimum of adjustments 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.409
 main in this case we have three 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.080
 activities that is the pedometer of 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.510
 food entry and registration power 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.030
 of thunder will do is measure the 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:48.090
 steps that we take in a walk the 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:51.150
 coach will measure us in a race 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.630
 continuous and food record the 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:56.880
 calories that we are daily if by 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.100
 example we think about parameter 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.950
 the main screen will come out 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.710
 just start and when the 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.380
 phone is moving as it 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.509
 move with our steps 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.700
 then the steps are added as well 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.960
 we see here in this case we're going to 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.210
 happen 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:19.150
 and we can access statistics 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.540
 from the graphs that we have here to the 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.670
 right 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.719
 in this case it tells us that on the day of 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.520
 today at 5 46 the 27 steps if we go back 

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:30.860
 to the menu 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.260
 that we can also access from the network 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.930
 diet up here and we go in 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.630
 In-depth we see that the camera screen 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.030
 it's a continuous load and the 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.850
 time we want to put career 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:47.120
 will also measure us the percentage of the 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:49.850
 burning of calories that we have effected and 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.180
 similarly we will have here below a 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:56.030
 triangulito with statistics 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:58.910
 any profile configuration that 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.930
 We want to do what we have in the menu 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.239
 settings 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.030
 and edit profile here come back out 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:08.760
 our profile and with this I hope 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.599
 that can do a control of the sport 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.599
 what do you do daily
