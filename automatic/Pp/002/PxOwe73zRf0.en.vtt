because<00:01:31.720> we<00:01:31.810> don't<00:01:31.960> just<00:01:32.140> follow<00:01:32.260> her<00:01:32.530> we

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
because we don't just follow her we

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.530 
because we don't just follow her we
follow<00:01:32.890> other<00:01:33.130> people<00:01:33.610> in<00:01:33.760> her<00:01:33.880> life<00:01:33.909> Stu<00:01:34.390> is

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.899 
follow other people in her life Stu is
quite<00:01:34.750> similar<00:01:35.200> to<00:01:35.229> British<00:01:35.620> Jones<00:01:35.890> but<00:01:36.640> I

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
quite similar to British Jones but I

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:37.950 
quite similar to British Jones but I
think<00:01:37.120> it's<00:01:37.240> just<00:01:37.270> because<00:01:37.510> the<00:01:37.780> lead

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
think it's just because the lead

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.630 
think it's just because the lead
character<00:01:38.500> is<00:01:38.620> a<00:01:38.650> female<00:01:39.130> people<00:01:39.340> will

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
character is a female people will

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.610 
character is a female people will
compare<00:01:40.090> it<00:01:40.240> to<00:01:40.390> that<00:01:40.630> and<00:01:41.140> because<00:01:41.409> she<00:01:41.560> is

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:41.620 
compare it to that and because she is

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.560 
compare it to that and because she is
looking<00:01:41.770> at<00:01:42.070> looking<00:01:42.340> for<00:01:42.520> love<00:01:42.700> people

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.409 
fresh new talent so we were actually
able<00:04:03.299> to<00:04:03.750> keep<00:04:04.109> our<00:04:04.400> online<00:04:05.400> cars<00:04:05.729> and<00:04:06.150> I<00:04:06.239> think

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:06.419 
able to keep our online cars and I think

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:07.879 
able to keep our online cars and I think
for<00:04:06.569> them<00:04:06.720> is<00:04:06.930> that<00:04:07.049> it's<00:04:07.290> a<00:04:07.379> great<00:04:07.620> platform

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:07.889 
for them is that it's a great platform

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:08.960 
for them is that it's a great platform
for<00:04:08.250> them<00:04:08.400> as<00:04:08.519> well<00:04:08.669> and<00:04:08.790> it's<00:04:08.879> a<00:04:08.940> great

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
for them as well and it's a great

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.719 
for them as well and it's a great
experience<00:04:09.209> because<00:04:09.840> they've<00:04:09.930> seen<00:04:10.260> the<00:04:10.590> show

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:10.729 
experience because they've seen the show

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:12.589 
experience because they've seen the show
develop<00:04:11.729> so<00:04:11.879> I<00:04:12.060> don't<00:04:12.209> think<00:04:12.329> I<00:04:12.449> would<00:04:12.540> have

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 
develop so I don't think I would have

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:14.270 
develop so I don't think I would have
been<00:04:12.690> fair<00:04:12.989> for<00:04:13.139> us<00:04:13.229> to<00:04:13.379> say<00:04:13.530> goodbye<00:04:14.040> because

want us to continue with that so they

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.700 
want us to continue with that so they
did<00:04:30.490> give<00:04:30.610> us<00:04:30.669> a<00:04:30.940> full<00:04:31.660> control<00:04:32.290> money<00:04:32.500> but

when<00:04:32.860> you<00:04:32.949> would

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.650 

get<00:04:40.310> it<00:04:40.430> picked<00:04:40.580> up<00:04:40.760> what<00:04:40.910> was<00:04:41.000> it<00:04:41.090> just<00:04:41.270> to<00:04:41.510> get

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
get it picked up what was it just to get

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.390 
get it picked up what was it just to get
it<00:04:41.720> out<00:04:41.870> of<00:04:41.990> there<00:04:42.169> I<00:04:42.380> think<00:04:42.560> for<00:04:42.800> us<00:04:42.949> you<00:04:43.280> know

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
it out of there I think for us you know

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.700 
it out of there I think for us you know
we<00:04:43.639> did<00:04:43.820> want<00:04:44.030> to<00:04:44.060> get<00:04:44.240> into<00:04:44.840> TV<00:04:45.050> eventually

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
we did want to get into TV eventually

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.800 
we did want to get into TV eventually
because<00:04:46.070> people<00:04:46.460> can't<00:04:46.699> work<00:04:47.060> for<00:04:47.330> free<00:04:47.540> for<00:04:47.570> a

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
because people can't work for free for a

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.110 
because people can't work for free for a
very<00:04:48.290> long<00:04:48.470> time<00:04:48.500> but<00:04:49.370> I<00:04:49.430> think<00:04:49.490> for<00:04:49.790> us<00:04:49.820> most

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
very long time but I think for us most

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.700 
very long time but I think for us most
deals<00:04:50.389> to<00:04:50.540> show<00:04:50.690> that<00:04:50.900> there<00:04:51.320> is<00:04:51.440> an<00:04:51.560> audience

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
out here for a show like this because a

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.530 
out here for a show like this because a
lot<00:04:54.979> of<00:04:55.010> the<00:04:55.160> arguments<00:04:55.610> on<00:04:55.699> TV<00:04:56.060> people<00:04:56.270> will

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:56.540 
lot of the arguments on TV people will

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:57.790 
lot of the arguments on TV people will
say<00:04:56.660> you<00:04:56.720> know<00:04:56.870> no<00:04:57.169> one<00:04:57.260> was<00:04:57.320> going<00:04:57.530> to<00:04:57.620> watch
