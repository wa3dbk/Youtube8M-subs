we're mega Charizard X right now I mean

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.869 
we're mega Charizard X right now I mean
it<00:02:15.959> isn't<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.319> mega<00:02:16.530> Charizard<00:02:16.799> o'clock<00:02:17.580> so

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
it isn't the mega Charizard o'clock so
