00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:25.200 
that cinematic experience and then on

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.660 
that cinematic experience and then on
top<00:00:25.439> of<00:00:25.500> that<00:00:25.650> we've<00:00:26.010> got<00:00:26.189> that<00:00:26.220> very

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
top of that we've got that very

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.380 
top of that we've got that very
intuitive<00:00:27.410> playstation<00:00:28.410> new<00:00:28.590> control

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390

implemented<00:00:30.390> in<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.750> Sharpshooter

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:44.220 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.860 

so<00:00:45.220> this<00:00:45.460> here<00:00:45.700> is<00:00:45.880> the<00:00:45.910> Sharpshooter<00:00:46.630> a

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 
so this here is the Sharpshooter a

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.230 
so this here is the Sharpshooter a
peripheral<00:00:47.650> that<00:00:48.070> we<00:00:48.250> at<00:00:48.520> gorilla<00:00:48.910> have

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:49.240 
peripheral that we at gorilla have

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.320 
peripheral that we at gorilla have
designed<00:00:49.930> in<00:00:50.530> collaboration<00:00:50.890> with<00:00:51.430> the<00:00:51.820> the

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:52.330 
designed in collaboration with the the

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.600 
designed in collaboration with the the
sokol<00:00:52.720> team<00:00:52.930> I<00:00:53.230> think<00:00:53.650> you<00:00:53.800> know<00:00:53.920> when<00:00:54.310> you<00:00:54.460> see

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 
sokol team I think you know when you see

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.220 
sokol team I think you know when you see
these<00:00:54.730> kind<00:00:54.880> of<00:00:55.000> peripherals<00:00:55.510> often<00:00:56.020> you<00:00:56.080> have

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.230 
these kind of peripherals often you have

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.620 
these kind of peripherals often you have
a<00:00:56.260> little<00:00:56.440> pistol<00:00:56.890> own<00:00:57.010> accord<00:00:57.430> but<00:00:58.390> this<00:00:58.450> is<00:00:58.600> a

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:58.630 
a little pistol own accord but this is a

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.900 
a little pistol own accord but this is a
full-fledged<00:00:59.110> design<00:00:59.680> where<00:01:00.040> make<00:01:00.370> killzone

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 
full-fledged design where make killzone

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.940 
full-fledged design where make killzone
accessible<00:01:01.630> to<00:01:01.780> a<00:01:01.810> broader<00:01:01.960> audience<00:01:02.350> and

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:02.950 
accessible to a broader audience and

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:12.969 
accessible to a broader audience and
move<00:01:03.640> really<00:01:03.970> helps<00:01:04.270> them

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.550 

the<00:01:13.979> mechanics<00:01:14.490> are<00:01:14.719> much<00:01:15.719> similar<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.229> our

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
the mechanics are much similar to our

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.349 
the mechanics are much similar to our
implementation<00:01:17.310> of<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.609> PlayStation<00:01:18.179> Move

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:18.359 
implementation of the PlayStation Move

implementation of the PlayStation Move
the<00:01:18.750> great<00:01:18.960> thing<00:01:18.990> is<00:01:19.170> we<00:01:19.289> have<00:01:19.560> some<00:01:19.740> gestures

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
the great thing is we have some gestures

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.279 
the great thing is we have some gestures
in<00:01:20.219> there<00:01:20.520> like<00:01:20.759> reload<00:01:21.299> is<00:01:21.509> right<00:01:22.020> there

00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:22.289 
in there like reload is right there

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:26.950 
in there like reload is right there
close<00:01:22.979> combat<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.759> actually<00:01:24.119> punch<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.600> guy

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.899 

we<00:01:27.960> made<00:01:28.140> sure<00:01:28.170> that<00:01:28.770> whatever<00:01:29.100> we<00:01:29.460> do<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:29.880> a

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
we made sure that whatever we do is a

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.350 
we made sure that whatever we do is a
default<00:01:30.509> is<00:01:30.750> very<00:01:31.200> easy<00:01:31.409> very<00:01:31.619> accessible<00:01:32.360> but

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
default is very easy very accessible but

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.090 
default is very easy very accessible but
for<00:01:33.569> more<00:01:33.689> experience<00:01:34.229> more<00:01:34.259> advanced<00:01:34.649> users

for more experience more advanced users

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.889 
for more experience more advanced users
make<00:01:35.310> sure<00:01:35.549> that<00:01:35.729> every<00:01:35.969> single<00:01:36.179> setting<00:01:36.630> is

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:36.899 
make sure that every single setting is
