00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:08.310
 In fact in Japan Japan made in Japan honestly think that things that can be done are done honestly 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:13.019
 So hey 

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:14.410
 I was feeling good and I was at the bottom of the moment I entered Germany 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:19.450
 I was blessed 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:23.050
 First of all in Japan, when it comes to health homes , you want to clean the air 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.810
 That's how I use natural materials . 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.279
 so 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:33.310
 Oh such mon Kana and Te painful Yareru only did it was by holiday house measures also 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:35.350
 If it is increasing, such is the scope of the Building Standard Act 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:41.170
 Actually the most important 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:46.149
 I say that it is the environment that is the temperature of the room or it is automatic 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:51.519
 Oh yes I'm terribly surprised If I'm basically trying to reduce fuel consumption 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:56.320
 Even if it is said that the energy cost which will endure in Japan is lowered and fuel consumption is low, it is its worth 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:58.660
 Just across the country people as what you are doing but I'm great as See This try it 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:03.190
 It says after all of this time 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:09.759
 Great East Japan g I finally gave it up for a while , but I think it was still very hard 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:17.080
 So it is low fuel consumption that you can spend comfortably even if you do not put up with it 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:19.430
 After all and say whether this is gonna How thinking from how to make residential 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.700
 It can not be done without making it 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.440
 I do not think 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:27.520
 What surprised me the most when I went to Germany 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:30.760
 No adhesive at all 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:33.910
 Something that says you have not used 1 mm 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:36.860
 It has been actually made being studied 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:39.950
 Since there was no seen such a thing in Japan 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:44.780
 But I'm so looking at that Well one case 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:50.479
 Say this is etc. I helluva difference Nde one thing there was full of everything these kind of things 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:56.690
 Then, in Germany, the child says April fire and does not understand even if you look at it at the same time 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:57.350
 Have a theme one by one and take in it little by little for several years now 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.560
 Umar 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.740
 In the middle 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:08.880
 8 That Germany 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:13.260
 There is a system called an energy pass that displays the fuel consumption of a house, and it must be 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:17.489
 The world was made that you should not do business without having it 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.000
 Well not only in Germany, but I say it all over Europe, but rent a home 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.730
 Or 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.690
 It is the fuel efficiency of the house that you sell or buy from that 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.980
 The law says that you must not be explicit unless you explicitly 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:32.200
 I also decided 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.650
 It's ready to be answered if everyone is told that the fuel consumption of the tag is long 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.530
 you know 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:41.490
 Among them , there was an energy pade said to somehow bring this into Japan 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.470
 I thought I wanted to 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.990
 Good Pass Association 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.110
 It takes about 2 years 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:50.190
 To while passing the love and Germany 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.190
 We have made
