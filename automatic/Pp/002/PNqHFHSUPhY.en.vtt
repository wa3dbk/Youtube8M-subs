the data somebody tells me things a late
sixties<00:00:43.640> Eldorado<00:00:44.210> here<00:00:44.629> so<00:00:44.839> you<00:00:44.989> definitely

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
sixties Eldorado here so you definitely

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.520 
sixties Eldorado here so you definitely
have<00:00:45.590> some<00:00:46.039> toxic<00:00:46.550> a<00:00:46.700> black<00:00:47.030> design<00:00:47.480> cues<00:00:47.840> look

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
have some toxic a black design cues look

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.139 
have some toxic a black design cues look
it<00:00:48.649> with<00:00:48.829> a<00:00:48.860> very<00:00:49.129> modern<00:00:49.579> twist

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
it with a very modern twist

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:52.689 
it with a very modern twist
now<00:00:50.600> this<00:00:50.809> BL<00:00:51.170> is<00:00:51.500> two<00:00:51.890> hundred<00:00:52.340> and<00:00:52.430> four

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699 
now this BL is two hundred and four

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:55.510 
now this BL is two hundred and four
inches<00:00:52.879> are<00:00:53.649> actually<00:00:54.649> three<00:00:55.039> inches<00:00:55.340> shorter

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
inches are actually three inches shorter

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.750 
inches are actually three inches shorter
than<00:00:56.449> the<00:00:56.570> t's<00:00:56.780> caps<00:00:57.140> but<00:00:57.770> the<00:00:57.949> reason<00:00:58.399> that<00:00:58.550> it

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
than the t's caps but the reason that it

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.560 
than the t's caps but the reason that it
appears<00:00:59.329> to<00:00:59.719> be<00:00:59.750> so<00:01:00.260> gigantic<00:01:01.010> is<00:01:01.129> that<00:01:01.570> 125

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
appears to be so gigantic is that 125

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:03.520 
appears to be so gigantic is that 125
inch<00:01:02.960> wheelbase

inch wheelbase

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.499 
inch wheelbase
now<00:01:04.250> difficult<00:01:04.460> like<00:01:04.759> that<00:01:05.000> says<00:01:05.300> run

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:05.509 
now difficult like that says run

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:07.420 
now difficult like that says run
throughout<00:01:05.780> the<00:01:06.020> vehicle<00:01:06.410> you<00:01:06.530> have<00:01:06.560> 22<00:01:07.220> inch

inside those wheels you might even

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.300 
inside those wheels you might even
notice<00:01:11.179> carbon<00:01:11.780> ceramic<00:01:11.990> brakes<00:01:12.259> so<00:01:12.950> that<00:01:13.130> can

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
notice carbon ceramic brakes so that can

looks a lot people say well the control
of<00:01:42.350> tree<00:01:42.829> is<00:01:43.040> what<00:01:43.280> you<00:01:43.399> get<00:01:43.810> conceptually

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
of tree is what you get conceptually

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.960 
of tree is what you get conceptually
here<00:01:45.079> I'll<00:01:45.290> give<00:01:45.500> you<00:01:45.530> like<00:01:46.070> the<00:01:46.130> laser<00:01:46.430> into<00:01:46.880> a

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
here I'll give you like the laser into a

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.999 
here I'll give you like the laser into a
crystal<00:01:47.630> and<00:01:47.869> from<00:01:48.049> there<00:01:48.259> the<00:01:48.439> light<00:01:48.619> as<00:01:48.829> this

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
crystal and from there the light as this

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.030 
crystal and from there the light as this
will<00:01:49.250> sound<00:01:49.520> like<00:01:49.670> a<00:01:49.909> regular<00:01:50.110> palatable<00:01:51.110> this

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
will sound like a regular palatable this
