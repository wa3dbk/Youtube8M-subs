00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.030 
a starter a lot of things before so am
as<00:01:44.670> i<00:01:44.970> said<00:01:45.149> earlier<00:01:45.180> will<00:01:45.930> would<00:01:46.619> soon<00:01:46.890> be

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
as i said earlier will would soon be

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.359 
as i said earlier will would soon be
coming<00:01:47.220> up<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.850> part<00:01:48.270> where<00:01:48.590> i<00:01:49.590> managed<00:01:50.310> to

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
coming up to the part where i managed to

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.789 
coming up to the part where i managed to
go<00:01:50.549> out<00:01:50.700> do<00:01:50.909> for<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.210> set<00:01:51.420> first<00:01:51.899> second<00:01:52.530> set

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
go out do for the set first second set

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.490 
go out do for the set first second set
of<00:01:52.860> trades<00:01:53.130> but<00:01:53.909> they<00:01:54.540> did<00:01:54.750> it<00:01:54.899> will<00:01:55.049> just

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
of trades but they did it will just

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.679 
of trades but they did it will just
disappear<00:01:55.890> so<00:01:56.610> i'll<00:01:56.820> explain<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.420> as<00:01:57.570> we're

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
disappear so i'll explain that as we're

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:58.819 
disappear so i'll explain that as we're
going<00:01:57.840> through<00:01:57.960> it<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:58.380> things<00:01:58.590> like<00:01:58.770> that

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
going through it and things like that

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.670 
going through it and things like that
and<00:01:59.329> i'll<00:02:00.329> probably<00:02:00.540> speed<00:02:00.869> up<00:02:00.990> all<00:02:01.200> of<00:02:01.500> this

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
and i'll probably speed up all of this

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.140 
and i'll probably speed up all of this
as<00:02:01.890> well

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
as well

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.050 
as well
so<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:03.960> if<00:02:04.590> you<00:02:04.710> enjoyed<00:02:05.280> this<00:02:05.490> idea<00:02:05.910> the

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
so and if you enjoyed this idea the

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.520 
so and if you enjoyed this idea the
series<00:02:06.390> I<00:02:06.420> didn't<00:02:06.750> know<00:02:06.810> what<00:02:07.020> players<00:02:07.290> to

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
series I didn't know what players to

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.010 
series I didn't know what players to
dick<00:02:07.740> trade<00:02:08.009> to<00:02:08.250> but<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.180> I<00:02:09.479> decided<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:09.930> go

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
dick trade to but and I decided to go

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.660 
dick trade to but and I decided to go
kisi<00:02:10.410> it's<00:02:10.560> just<00:02:10.740> because<00:02:10.890> he's<00:02:11.070> probably<00:02:11.340> one

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
kisi it's just because he's probably one

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.250 
kisi it's just because he's probably one
that<00:02:11.700> I<00:02:11.880> wouldn't<00:02:12.120> go<00:02:12.240> out<00:02:12.270> and<00:02:12.600> buy<00:02:12.750> normally

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
that I wouldn't go out and buy normally

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.230 
that I wouldn't go out and buy normally
so<00:02:13.410> it'd<00:02:13.500> be<00:02:13.560> nice<00:02:13.800> to<00:02:13.830> be<00:02:13.950> able<00:02:14.070> to<00:02:14.220> trade<00:02:15.060> my

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
so it'd be nice to be able to trade my

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.090 
so it'd be nice to be able to trade my
way<00:02:15.360> up<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:15.570> him<00:02:15.840> and<00:02:16.050> there<00:02:16.290> that<00:02:16.680> been<00:02:16.890> nicely

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
way up to him and there that been nicely

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.940 
way up to him and there that been nicely
work<00:02:17.430> too<00:02:17.700> so<00:02:18.510> am<00:02:18.690> I<00:02:19.110> was<00:02:19.350> going<00:02:19.560> to<00:02:19.620> ask<00:02:19.680> you

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
work too so am I was going to ask you

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.980 
work too so am I was going to ask you
all<00:02:20.130> what<00:02:20.520> played<00:02:20.910> straight<00:02:21.270> to<00:02:21.450> boat<00:02:21.660> in<00:02:21.870> the

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
all what played straight to boat in the

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.570 
all what played straight to boat in the
end<00:02:22.080> just<00:02:22.500> went<00:02:22.650> for<00:02:22.710> Casillas<00:02:23.220> because<00:02:23.460> it

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
end just went for Casillas because it

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.340 
end just went for Casillas because it
was<00:02:23.670> a<00:02:23.700> bit<00:02:23.880> probably<00:02:24.450> better<00:02:24.720> option<00:02:25.050> for<00:02:25.080> me

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
was a bit probably better option for me

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.890 
was a bit probably better option for me
but<00:02:26.280> I<00:02:26.310> would<00:02:26.700> just<00:02:26.880> see<00:02:27.030> now<00:02:27.210> those<00:02:27.420> three

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
but I would just see now those three

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.770 
but I would just see now those three
things<00:02:28.080> sold<00:02:28.970> instantly<00:02:29.970> we<00:02:30.150> got<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.360> 1k
