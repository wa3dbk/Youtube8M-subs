00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
of spark plug wires I'm not sure if any

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.140 
of spark plug wires I'm not sure if any
of<00:04:09.290> that<00:04:09.320> stuff<00:04:09.530> is<00:04:09.800> good<00:04:10.430> so<00:04:10.700> I'm<00:04:10.790> not<00:04:10.910> sure<00:04:10.970> if

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
of that stuff is good so I'm not sure if

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.060 
of that stuff is good so I'm not sure if
I'm<00:04:11.209> gonna<00:04:11.300> use<00:04:11.390> it<00:04:11.720> a<00:04:11.870> couple<00:04:11.930> of<00:04:12.590> sill<00:04:12.800> plates

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.070 
I'm gonna use it a couple of sill plates

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:14.650 
I'm gonna use it a couple of sill plates
which<00:04:13.550> are<00:04:13.670> garbage<00:04:13.970> because<00:04:14.300> they're

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
which are garbage because they're

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.940 
which are garbage because they're
corroded<00:04:15.320> I<00:04:15.500> have<00:04:16.220> a<00:04:16.270> nice<00:04:17.270> colorful<00:04:17.950> door

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.110 
corroded I have a nice colorful door
panel<00:04:19.370> it<00:04:19.430> looks<00:04:19.549> like<00:04:19.669> someone<00:04:19.880> got<00:04:19.970> it

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
panel it looks like someone got it

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.370 
panel it looks like someone got it
carried<00:04:20.390> away<00:04:20.540> with<00:04:20.660> the<00:04:20.780> fluorescent<00:04:21.020> orange

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.670 
carried away with the fluorescent orange
spray<00:04:22.070> paint<00:04:22.340> so<00:04:22.990> that's<00:04:23.990> getting<00:04:24.350> trashed

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
spray paint so that's getting trashed

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.560 
spray paint so that's getting trashed
and<00:04:25.130> they<00:04:25.370> also<00:04:25.520> got<00:04:25.760> the<00:04:25.910> spray<00:04:26.150> pin<00:04:26.330> on<00:04:26.450> the

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
and they also got the spray pin on the

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
and they also got the spray pin on the
upper<00:04:26.780> door<00:04:26.900> panel<00:04:27.200> so<00:04:27.289> that's<00:04:27.470> getting

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
upper door panel so that's getting

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.100 
upper door panel so that's getting
trashed<00:04:27.979> you<00:04:28.700> driver<00:04:29.000> side<00:04:29.300> door<00:04:29.600> panel

the<00:04:30.229> lower<00:04:30.500> is<00:04:30.860> perfect<00:04:31.520> so<00:04:32.300> I'll<00:04:32.389> probably<00:04:32.599> be

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
the lower is perfect so I'll probably be

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.920 
the lower is perfect so I'll probably be
using<00:04:33.349> that<00:04:33.500> in<00:04:33.770> this<00:04:34.039> car<00:04:34.340> the<00:04:35.270> upper<00:04:35.689> is

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
using that in this car the upper is

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.200 
using that in this car the upper is
trash<00:04:36.379> because<00:04:37.099> the<00:04:37.280> person<00:04:37.669> was<00:04:37.849> a<00:04:37.879> smoker

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
are for this car those upper hoses look

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.189 
are for this car those upper hoses look
to<00:05:31.129> be<00:05:31.250> pretty<00:05:31.460> skinny<00:05:31.819> but<00:05:32.750> they're<00:05:32.900> the<00:05:32.990> same

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:33.199 
to be pretty skinny but they're the same

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:35.409 
to be pretty skinny but they're the same
so<00:05:33.650> I'll<00:05:34.190> check<00:05:34.430> those<00:05:34.610> out<00:05:34.759> but<00:05:35.029> hey

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:35.419 
so I'll check those out but hey

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:37.480 
so I'll check those out but hey
either<00:05:36.080> way<00:05:36.199> got<00:05:36.469> a<00:05:36.500> lot<00:05:36.710> of<00:05:36.740> good<00:05:36.979> parts<00:05:37.250> that

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
either way got a lot of good parts that

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.700 
either way got a lot of good parts that
came<00:05:37.639> with<00:05:37.759> this<00:05:37.909> car<00:05:38.150> a<00:05:38.389> bunch<00:05:39.259> of<00:05:39.349> good<00:05:39.529> use
