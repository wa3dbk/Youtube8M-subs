00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.340 
it's nice to know that it can get out
there<00:02:51.490> as<00:02:51.610> well<00:02:51.870> mostly<00:02:52.870> we've<00:02:52.989> got<00:02:53.140> some

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
there as well mostly we've got some

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.830 
there as well mostly we've got some
ventilation<00:02:53.590> up<00:02:53.980> here<00:02:54.540> that's<00:02:55.540> going<00:02:55.690> to<00:02:55.780> be

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
ventilation up here that's going to be

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.110 
ventilation up here that's going to be
pretty<00:02:55.959> good<00:02:56.230> for<00:02:57.010> heat<00:02:57.430> rising<00:02:57.850> some

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
pretty good for heat rising some

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.580 
pretty good for heat rising some
obviously<00:02:58.540> the<00:02:58.630> water<00:02:58.810> cooling<00:02:59.170> holes<00:02:59.380> left

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
obviously the water cooling holes left

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.710 
obviously the water cooling holes left
number<00:02:59.920> who<00:03:00.040> use<00:03:00.160> those<00:03:00.370> but<00:03:00.760> i<00:03:00.970> do<00:03:01.480> plan<00:03:01.600> on

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
number who use those but i do plan on

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.060 
number who use those but i do plan on
water<00:03:01.959> cooling<00:03:02.260> in<00:03:02.350> the<00:03:02.380> future<00:03:02.709> so<00:03:02.830> this<00:03:02.920> is

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
water cooling in the future so this is

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.160 
water cooling in the future so this is
why<00:03:03.280> i<00:03:03.310> picked<00:03:03.610> up<00:03:03.760> this<00:03:03.880> case<00:03:04.120> if<00:03:04.870> you<00:03:05.020> want

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
why i picked up this case if you want

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.260 
why i picked up this case if you want
i'll<00:03:05.320> have<00:03:05.410> a<00:03:05.440> radiator<00:03:06.310> whatnot<00:03:06.730> in<00:03:06.880> here<00:03:07.060> so

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
i'll have a radiator whatnot in here so

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.930 
i'll have a radiator whatnot in here so
we<00:03:08.080> will<00:03:08.170> embark<00:03:08.560> see<00:03:08.680> that<00:03:08.860> as<00:03:08.950> well<00:03:09.100> power

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
we will embark see that as well power

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.640 
we will embark see that as well power
supply<00:03:10.239> mounting<00:03:10.600> down<00:03:10.780> here<00:03:13.650> definitely

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
supply mounting down here definitely

off the protective stuff on the front

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.290 
off the protective stuff on the front
slowly<00:03:58.710> or<00:03:59.460> else<00:03:59.610> you'll<00:03:59.700> pull<00:03:59.910> off<00:04:00.000> the<00:04:00.120> coast

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
slowly or else you'll pull off the coast

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.460 
slowly or else you'll pull off the coast
well<00:04:00.510> I<00:04:00.540> won't<00:04:00.750> do<00:04:00.840> it<00:04:00.930> right<00:04:01.050> now<00:04:01.080> to<00:04:01.230> get<00:04:01.380> out

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
well I won't do it right now to get out

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.960 
well I won't do it right now to get out
go<00:04:01.530> to<00:04:01.560> macular<00:04:01.800> box<00:04:02.160> but<00:04:02.750> yeah<00:04:04.340> but<00:04:05.340> so

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
go to macular box but yeah but so

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.400 
go to macular box but yeah but so
looking<00:04:06.300> like<00:04:06.450> we<00:04:06.570> got<00:04:06.690> on<00:04:06.900> this<00:04:06.990> is<00:04:07.140> the<00:04:07.230> front

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
looking like we got on this is the front

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.500 
looking like we got on this is the front
panel<00:04:07.650> area<00:04:07.950> where<00:04:08.310> I'm<00:04:08.430> therefore<00:04:09.030> hot-swap

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
panel area where I'm therefore hot-swap

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.990 
panel area where I'm therefore hot-swap
will<00:04:09.750> drive<00:04:09.960> bays<00:04:10.260> in<00:04:10.290> here<00:04:10.710> and<00:04:10.890> this<00:04:11.610> panel

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
will drive bays in here and this panel

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.940 
will drive bays in here and this panel
is<00:04:12.120> reversible<00:04:12.720> you<00:04:12.840> can't<00:04:13.020> take<00:04:13.470> it<00:04:13.620> and<00:04:13.740> turn

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
is reversible you can't take it and turn

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.920 
is reversible you can't take it and turn
upside<00:04:14.220> down<00:04:14.250> so<00:04:15.090> it's<00:04:15.300> from<00:04:15.420> this<00:04:15.540> side<00:04:15.780> if

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
upside down so it's from this side if

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:26.629 
upside down so it's from this side if
you<00:04:16.050> if<00:04:16.290> you<00:04:16.470> wish<00:04:17.120> up<00:04:18.120> here<00:04:18.480> we<00:04:18.810> got<00:04:18.930> our

button<00:04:40.590> we<00:04:41.310> got<00:04:41.460> our<00:04:42.620> power<00:04:43.620> button<00:04:43.889> right

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:44.039 
button we got our power button right

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:46.309 
button we got our power button right
here<00:04:44.069> is<00:04:44.430> most<00:04:45.180> likely<00:04:45.599> that<00:04:45.779> it<00:04:45.900> was<00:04:46.139> the

00:04:46.309 --> 00:04:46.319 
here is most likely that it was the

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:48.019 
here is most likely that it was the
power<00:04:46.529> or<00:04:46.830> a<00:04:46.860> hard<00:04:47.159> but<00:04:47.370> actually<00:04:47.819> this<00:04:47.909> would

00:04:48.019 --> 00:04:48.029 
power or a hard but actually this would

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:49.489 
power or a hard but actually this would
be<00:04:48.120> a<00:04:48.150> hard<00:04:48.300> drive<00:04:48.539> like<00:04:48.719> the<00:04:48.870> power<00:04:49.050> button<00:04:49.259> we

00:04:49.489 --> 00:04:49.499 
be a hard drive like the power button we

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:51.439 
be a hard drive like the power button we
little<00:04:49.770> power<00:04:50.610> light<00:04:50.789> will<00:04:50.819> be<00:04:50.969> inside<00:04:51.360> the

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:51.449 
little power light will be inside the
