00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
think that makes a little lighter if you

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
think that makes a little lighter if you
want<00:01:14.409> to<00:01:14.590> put<00:01:14.830> it<00:01:14.950> in<00:01:15.070> the<00:01:15.250> back<00:01:16.770> you<00:01:17.770> know<00:01:17.950> with
