00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
so tensions were tight and pretty wacky

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.580 
so tensions were tight and pretty wacky
so<00:02:30.150> I<00:02:30.180> had<00:02:30.390> to<00:02:30.420> loosen<00:02:30.720> it<00:02:30.959> up<00:02:31.020> and<00:02:31.230> even<00:02:31.470> them

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
so I had to loosen it up and even them

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.590 
so I had to loosen it up and even them
out<00:02:31.680> a<00:02:31.739> bit<00:02:31.860> I<00:02:32.160> did<00:02:32.550> some<00:02:32.670> solves<00:02:33.090> after<00:02:33.450> that

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
out a bit I did some solves after that

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.089 
out a bit I did some solves after that
the<00:02:33.989> speed<00:02:34.290> improved<00:02:34.739> a<00:02:34.890> whole<00:02:34.920> bunch<00:02:37.099> but

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
the speed improved a whole bunch but

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:43.430 
the speed improved a whole bunch but
this<00:02:38.370> thing<00:02:38.580> is<00:02:38.610> fast<00:02:39.450> now<00:02:40.610> whoops<00:02:41.610> ah<00:02:42.440> six

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
this thing is fast now whoops ah six

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.970 
this thing is fast now whoops ah six
times<00:02:43.650> he<00:02:44.400> has<00:02:44.519> this<00:02:44.670> thing<00:02:44.880> as<00:02:45.000> fast<00:02:45.030> now<00:02:45.980> it's

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
times he has this thing as fast now it's

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.300 
times he has this thing as fast now it's
smooth<00:02:47.310> feeling<00:02:48.140> with<00:02:49.140> a<00:02:49.380> bumpy<00:02:49.860> feel<00:02:50.040> to<00:02:50.280> it

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
smooth feeling with a bumpy feel to it

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.490 
smooth feeling with a bumpy feel to it
so<00:02:51.090> when<00:02:51.180> you<00:02:51.299> turn<00:02:51.510> you<00:02:51.720> feel<00:02:51.870> like<00:02:51.989> a<00:02:52.019> bumpy

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
so when you turn you feel like a bumpy

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:58.039 
so when you turn you feel like a bumpy
nest<00:02:52.980> with<00:02:53.220> it<00:02:56.090> but<00:02:57.090> it's<00:02:57.239> a<00:02:57.330> smooth<00:02:57.690> feeling

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
nest with it but it's a smooth feeling

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:02.150 
nest with it but it's a smooth feeling
like<00:02:58.709> a<00:02:58.799> smooth<00:02:59.100> turning<00:02:59.489> puzzle<00:03:01.040> I'm<00:03:02.040> not

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
like a smooth turning puzzle I'm not

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.490 
like a smooth turning puzzle I'm not
sure<00:03:02.220> if<00:03:02.519> I'm<00:03:02.640> gonna<00:03:02.790> I<00:03:03.209> think<00:03:04.019> I<00:03:04.110> might<00:03:04.260> want

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
sure if I'm gonna I think I might want

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.380 
sure if I'm gonna I think I might want
to<00:03:04.590> loosen<00:03:04.830> this<00:03:05.160> thing<00:03:05.400> up<00:03:05.519> some<00:03:05.940> more<00:03:06.180> or

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
to loosen this thing up some more or

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.050 
to loosen this thing up some more or
maybe<00:03:06.540> tighten<00:03:07.049> it<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:08.160> speed<00:03:08.370> is<00:03:08.400> great<00:03:08.819> I

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
maybe tighten it the speed is great I

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.120 
maybe tighten it the speed is great I
just<00:03:09.299> want<00:03:09.690> to<00:03:09.989> find<00:03:10.230> that<00:03:10.350> perfect<00:03:10.590> tension

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
just want to find that perfect tension

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.500 
just want to find that perfect tension
that<00:03:11.730> I<00:03:11.790> really<00:03:12.150> like<00:03:12.329> I<00:03:14.000> mean<00:03:15.000> corner-cutting

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
that I really like I mean corner-cutting

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.930 
that I really like I mean corner-cutting
is<00:03:15.780> like<00:03:16.320> nice<00:03:16.590> now<00:03:16.829> I<00:03:16.859> can<00:03:17.130> actually<00:03:17.370> corner

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
is like nice now I can actually corner

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.280 
is like nice now I can actually corner
cut<00:03:18.120> it<00:03:18.239> which<00:03:19.019> is<00:03:19.170> good<00:03:21.019> I'm<00:03:22.019> not<00:03:22.140> really

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
cut it which is good I'm not really

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.130 
cut it which is good I'm not really
getting<00:03:22.470> too<00:03:22.799> many<00:03:22.920> locks<00:03:23.250> on<00:03:23.430> this<00:03:23.900> I'm<00:03:24.900> not

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
getting too many locks on this I'm not

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.440 
getting too many locks on this I'm not
getting<00:03:25.410> as<00:03:25.590> much<00:03:25.620> catching<00:03:26.190> as<00:03:26.549> I<00:03:27.060> did<00:03:27.239> on<00:03:27.269> my

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
getting as much catching as I did on my

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.970 
getting as much catching as I did on my
Diane<00:03:28.049> my<00:03:28.260> Diane<00:03:28.500> caught<00:03:29.430> a<00:03:29.459> bunch<00:03:29.700> and<00:03:30.000> this

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
Diane my Diane caught a bunch and this

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.160 
Diane my Diane caught a bunch and this
just<00:03:31.980> fixed<00:03:32.670> a<00:03:32.790> lot<00:03:32.850> of<00:03:33.180> that<00:03:33.329> so<00:03:33.720> I'm<00:03:33.930> happy

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
just fixed a lot of that so I'm happy

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.220 
just fixed a lot of that so I'm happy
about<00:03:34.350> that<00:03:35.269> also<00:03:36.269> my<00:03:36.420> dine<00:03:36.600> used<00:03:36.840> to<00:03:36.959> corner

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
about that also my dine used to corner

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.800 
about that also my dine used to corner
twists<00:03:37.530> on<00:03:37.829> me<00:03:38.070> when<00:03:38.880> I'm<00:03:39.000> either<00:03:39.269> solving<00:03:39.720> a

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
twists on me when I'm either solving a

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.710 
twists on me when I'm either solving a
scramblin<00:03:40.290> because<00:03:40.620> i<00:03:40.920> have<00:03:41.519> my<00:03:41.700> down<00:03:41.880> pretty

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
scramblin because i have my down pretty

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.759 
scramblin because i have my down pretty
loose<00:03:42.900> so<00:03:43.140> i<00:03:43.170> can<00:03:43.590> have<00:03:43.980> it<00:03:44.100> really<00:03:44.340> fast<00:03:44.570> so

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
loose so i can have it really fast so

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:48.229 
loose so i can have it really fast so
you<00:03:46.769> know<00:03:46.890> it<00:03:47.160> would<00:03:47.340> corner<00:03:47.579> to<00:03:47.730> us<00:03:47.820> this<00:03:48.000> one

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
you know it would corner to us this one

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.780 
you know it would corner to us this one
I<00:03:48.590> can<00:03:49.590> be<00:03:49.709> as<00:03:49.799> rough<00:03:49.829> as<00:03:50.100> I<00:03:50.190> want<00:03:50.459> I'll<00:03:50.609> never

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
I can be as rough as I want I'll never

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.599 
I can be as rough as I want I'll never
get<00:03:50.970> a<00:03:51.030> corner<00:03:51.359> twists<00:03:51.600> or<00:03:52.019> a<00:03:52.100> pop<00:03:53.100> off<00:03:53.340> and

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
get a corner twists or a pop off and

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:55.699 
get a corner twists or a pop off and
never<00:03:53.670> gotten<00:03:54.000> a<00:03:54.060> pop<00:03:54.269> on<00:03:54.510> it<00:03:54.630> overall<00:03:55.350> I<00:03:55.590> would

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
never gotten a pop on it overall I would

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.380 
never gotten a pop on it overall I would
say<00:03:55.890> this<00:03:56.400> is<00:03:56.459> coming<00:03:56.850> along<00:03:57.000> really<00:03:57.299> nicely

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
say this is coming along really nicely

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.930 
say this is coming along really nicely
it's<00:03:57.930> already<00:03:58.290> my<00:03:58.410> main<00:03:58.680> I<00:03:59.010> feel<00:03:59.459> like<00:03:59.549> I<00:03:59.700> still

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
it's already my main I feel like I still

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.240 
it's already my main I feel like I still
need<00:04:00.120> to<00:04:00.239> break<00:04:00.420> it<00:04:00.540> in<00:04:00.630> some<00:04:00.810> more<00:04:00.840> and<00:04:01.260> maybe

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
need to break it in some more and maybe

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.650 
need to break it in some more and maybe
we're<00:04:02.489> quit<00:04:02.730> it<00:04:02.819> a<00:04:02.940> little<00:04:03.090> bit<00:04:03.239> more<00:04:03.450> maybe

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
we're quit it a little bit more maybe

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.840 
we're quit it a little bit more maybe
try<00:04:04.650> to<00:04:04.680> find<00:04:04.950> that<00:04:05.040> perfect<00:04:05.280> tension<00:04:05.760> that

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
try to find that perfect tension that

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.720 
try to find that perfect tension that
I'm<00:04:05.970> looking<00:04:06.060> for<00:04:06.239> but<00:04:07.230> yeah<00:04:07.769> this<00:04:08.220> is<00:04:08.370> my<00:04:08.549> main

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
I'm looking for but yeah this is my main

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.319 
I'm looking for but yeah this is my main

now if you if you have a perfect Diane

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:14.120 
now if you if you have a perfect Diane
it's<00:04:12.329> not<00:04:12.569> necessary<00:04:13.350> for<00:04:13.410> you<00:04:13.560> to<00:04:13.650> upgrade<00:04:13.859> to

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
it's not necessary for you to upgrade to

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.890 
it's not necessary for you to upgrade to
this
