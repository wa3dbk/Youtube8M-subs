00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:10.080
 The moon looks like you are rodrigo and 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.170
 I'm making this video here fast on 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.910
 style just to comment on two things 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.170
 which has a bit to do with the theme of 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.500
 channel so I thought it would be interesting 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.539
 talk about them in a video the first one 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.840
 I 'm filming this here on camera 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.430
 front of important fifth generation 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.650
 which is the poor that was announced 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.750
 along with the iphone 5 it has until 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.769
 strap is equal to iphone 5 and 4 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.210
 inches 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.190
 but what I found very nice that the 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.739
 two cameras he shoots high 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.530
 setting the rear camera 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.530
 full HD and the front camera which is what I 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.329
 I'm using here she shoots in 720p 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.340
 The cool thing is, you can film yourself. 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.570
 looking at yourself on the screen does not 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.850
 works like a camera 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.949
 of those who have the little screen that rotates 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.750
 This is really cool and the final quality 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.940
 people will see in this video when 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.910
 posted on youtube but by elbow 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.359
 Predicted here is well die well. 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.760
 satisfactory but not only in this 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.310
 comment about the ipod touch camera 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.540
 I have another subject here about the 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.920
 I wanted to comment, I think it will. 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.470
 to interest a lot of people 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:21.180
 It's good that you know this here is a 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:27.570
 camera team closer to capture 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:30.750
 super famous that makes 14 720 480 msd in 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.490
 standard definition but this one I think 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.930
 that I can a new team is not 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.470
 My friend, this is a colleague of mine. 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.880
 bought in qwest trim is basically the 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.400
 same thing we already know more 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.759
 It seems to me that the software part is 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.810
 even that it is updated and finally I 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.000
 I think it's better than the previous ones 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.630
 so I realized that it costs something 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.899
 ten dollars on stream day plus she 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:02:00.020
 comes with the cd that already includes the 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:05.250
 windows 7 does not have here on cd 13 with 5 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:07.440
 c / v 13 with 5 717 64 whether it comes from 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.490
 factory ready to roll 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.230
 the windows 7 64 bit drivers already comes with 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.140
 drivers for windows 64-bit 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.910
 and I noticed that when the tube in the 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.180
 computer it was not recognized as 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.190
 usb 2.0 to tv which is what I say in 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.610
 riquelme tutorials working for 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:29.250
 go there and I noticed that she is known 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.510
 as the caption you want to know of emmy 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:35.730
 a different way 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:38.010
 but the main thing is that in the debt program 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.800
 video wants I already used prosthesis 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.140
 To record with the old team, let's go. 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.850
 say so her image seemed to me 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.670
 get much better much better even 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.470
 with less interference and finally has no 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.980
 problem with the capture with this 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:57.120
 staff here that I said the same thing 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.530
 model of 60 inclusive but that it is 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.450
 known in another way in the 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.880
 your computer and comes with the 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:07.410
 windows 7 or his box is the same thing 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.940
 same thing even seemed better not 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.280
 I also know if it 's the fact that it's new 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:15.480
 so the clubs do not have any kind of 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.830
 oxidation I do not know but there's a hint right 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.470
 so what I basically did for 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.060
 capture with it was thumb install the 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.940
 driver that comes the cd did not hit any 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.890
 driver is incompatible on the internet that 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.570
 happened the previous time you tried 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.070
 install the driver and I said it is not 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.709
 You know that does not happen with this. 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.239
 here has been proving the 7 and when 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.269
 anyone should have the picture stayed 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:38.610
 very clean to capture the office 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.410
 that scheme to turn on sound output 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.910
 instead of direct the team in the 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:46.500
 computer microphone 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:50.160
 but still I thought the sound was 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.900
 there was better than either the old 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.040
 like it was an old one that I think 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.620
 this is a model a little more is always 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:59.459
 the better with clearer was less 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:03.540
 interesting variations if you have 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:05.280
 Import by paypal by director 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:09.930
 tell your site people ask 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:12.209
 it was not the 30th of this month the store me 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.519
 seems an interesting option as the former 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.140
 team still well pop in the searches on 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:17.760
 youtube people ask me a lot 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:20.310
 because they find my videos that I speak of 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:24.750
 it does not even seem like this is a model 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:26.250
 It's cool, it's very cheap, you come. 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.570
 importing takes more than one month to 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.800
 but you need to get an account on 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.590
 paypal 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.540
 I'll leave the link to her, I do not even 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.110
 This friend of mine used to buy there 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:38.850
 because I think it might interest you 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:41.070
 That's what I wanted to comment on today. 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.570
 I wanted to talk about this board that I do not know 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.250
 if it's a new model but finally it comes 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:47.340
 updated with the windows 7 driver 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:50.070
 factory direct and also in shooting 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.979
 with the fifth-generation 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:56.010
 seems good to involve the result in 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:57.270
 camera on youtube then if all the time 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.620
 everybody to the gospel screen for the 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.840
 slow motion 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.800
 this is it, you liked the video is cyclical 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.570
 and I liked it 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.790
