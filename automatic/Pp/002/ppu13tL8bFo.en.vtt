00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:31.280 
and the reason I like scars so much is

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.459 
and the reason I like scars so much is

because you know anytime you add a scarf

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:35.260 
because you know anytime you add a scarf
to<00:00:33.710> an<00:00:33.770> outfit<00:00:34.129> is<00:00:34.280> just<00:00:34.309> that<00:00:34.699> you<00:00:35.090> know<00:00:35.210> you

guys<00:01:44.420> can<00:01:44.630> see<00:01:44.899> all<00:01:45.109> it<00:01:45.229> takes<00:01:45.469> is<00:01:45.619> just

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:45.829 
guys can see all it takes is just

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:49.480 
guys can see all it takes is just
practice<00:01:47.020> another<00:01:48.020> way<00:01:48.259> to<00:01:48.319> wear<00:01:48.709> scarf<00:01:49.219> is

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
practice another way to wear scarf is

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.839 
practice another way to wear scarf is
also<00:01:49.969> called<00:01:50.450> a<00:01:50.659> prism<00:01:51.259> knot<00:01:51.560> but<00:01:52.279> this<00:01:52.490> one<00:01:52.700> is

00:01:52.839 --> 00:01:52.849 
also called a prism knot but this one is

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:54.940 
also called a prism knot but this one is
going<00:01:52.999> to<00:01:53.060> be<00:01:53.209> with<00:01:53.359> a<00:01:53.389> bit<00:01:53.599> of<00:01:53.719> a<00:01:53.779> twist<00:01:54.049> so<00:01:54.380> you

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
going to be with a bit of a twist so you

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.649 
going to be with a bit of a twist so you
would<00:01:55.099> start<00:01:55.369> the<00:01:55.520> same<00:01:55.729> way<00:01:55.759> so<00:01:55.969> again<00:01:56.419> I'll

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
would start the same way so again I'll

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:57.969 
would start the same way so again I'll
start<00:01:56.779> from<00:01:56.990> the<00:01:57.079> beginning<00:01:57.229> you<00:01:57.619> fold<00:01:57.859> the

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
start from the beginning you fold the

00:01:57.979 --> 00:01:59.919 
start from the beginning you fold the
scarf<00:01:58.189> in<00:01:58.399> two<00:01:58.669> so<00:01:59.239> you<00:01:59.329> have<00:01:59.509> two<00:01:59.689> pieces

00:01:59.919 --> 00:01:59.929 
scarf in two so you have two pieces

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:02.469 
scarf in two so you have two pieces
right<00:02:00.349> you<00:02:01.340> drape<00:02:01.609> it<00:02:01.759> around<00:02:01.849> your<00:02:02.149> neck<00:02:02.329> you

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
right you drape it around your neck you

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.929 
right you drape it around your neck you
have<00:02:02.630> equal<00:02:02.989> parts<00:02:03.169> here<00:02:03.679> and<00:02:03.889> you<00:02:04.520> will<00:02:04.669> start

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
have equal parts here and you will start

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:06.550 
have equal parts here and you will start
at<00:02:05.060> just<00:02:05.329> the<00:02:05.479> same<00:02:05.719> way<00:02:05.929> you<00:02:05.959> will<00:02:06.229> start<00:02:06.469> a

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
at just the same way you will start a

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.160 
at just the same way you will start a
Parisian<00:02:07.039> not<00:02:07.300> except<00:02:08.300> that<00:02:08.450> in<00:02:08.599> this<00:02:08.810> one

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
Parisian not except that in this one

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.740 
Parisian not except that in this one
you'll<00:02:09.619> just<00:02:09.920> pull<00:02:10.160> one

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
you'll just pull one

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.810 
you'll just pull one
one<00:02:11.500> of<00:02:11.650> these<00:02:11.800> in<00:02:12.700> and<00:02:13.120> then<00:02:13.750> you<00:02:13.840> still<00:02:14.110> have

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
one of these in and then you still have

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.480 
one of these in and then you still have
another<00:02:15.820> end<00:02:16.150> so<00:02:16.960> what<00:02:17.200> you<00:02:17.320> do<00:02:17.530> instead<00:02:17.980> of

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
another end so what you do instead of

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:24.690 
another end so what you do instead of
pulling<00:02:18.850> it<00:02:19.060> in<00:02:19.410> you<00:02:20.410> go<00:02:21.390> under<00:02:22.390> and<00:02:23.460> you<00:02:24.460> bring

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700

pulling it in you go under and you bring
it<00:02:24.880> over<00:02:25.120> and<00:02:26.130> you<00:02:27.130> will<00:02:27.280> have<00:02:27.460> this<00:02:27.640> really

book of how to wear scars so it's just
an<00:03:10.060> easy<00:03:10.390> way<00:03:10.510> for<00:03:10.600> you<00:03:10.900> to<00:03:10.930> differentiate

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
an easy way for you to differentiate

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.040 
an easy way for you to differentiate
from<00:03:11.920> one<00:03:12.220> way<00:03:12.430> to<00:03:12.459> another<00:03:12.730> so<00:03:13.600> this<00:03:13.840> one<00:03:14.020> I

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
from one way to another so this one I

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.009 
from one way to another so this one I
called<00:03:14.440> a<00:03:14.680> double<00:03:15.340> parisian<00:03:15.880> nut<00:03:16.090> so<00:03:16.660> what<00:03:16.900> you

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
called a double parisian nut so what you

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.620 
called a double parisian nut so what you
would<00:03:17.170> do<00:03:17.350> is<00:03:17.500> just<00:03:17.530> start<00:03:17.980> the<00:03:18.130> same<00:03:18.340> way<00:03:18.600> pull

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
would do is just start the same way pull

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.750 
would do is just start the same way pull
so<00:03:20.320> you<00:03:20.380> drape<00:03:20.769> it<00:03:20.920> on<00:03:21.040> your<00:03:21.190> neck<00:03:21.340> you<00:03:21.580> have

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
so you drape it on your neck you have

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.090 
so you drape it on your neck you have
the<00:03:21.940> loop<00:03:22.330> and<00:03:22.570> you<00:03:22.720> have<00:03:22.840> the<00:03:22.989> ends<00:03:23.350> you<00:03:23.500> pull

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
the loop and you have the ends you pull

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.040 
the loop and you have the ends you pull
the<00:03:24.280> ends<00:03:24.519> through<00:03:24.640> the<00:03:24.700> loop<00:03:24.850> and<00:03:25.209> then<00:03:25.900> you

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
the ends through the loop and then you

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.250 
the ends through the loop and then you
have<00:03:26.260> all<00:03:26.560> this<00:03:26.860> extra<00:03:27.340> space<00:03:28.150> here<00:03:28.600> so<00:03:29.050> what

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
have all this extra space here so what

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.080 
have all this extra space here so what
you<00:03:29.380> do<00:03:29.530> with<00:03:29.650> the<00:03:29.769> space<00:03:30.040> is<00:03:30.310> like<00:03:30.489> you<00:03:30.700> twist

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
you do with the space is like you twist

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.020 
you do with the space is like you twist
it<00:03:31.269> around<00:03:31.390> and<00:03:32.010> you<00:03:33.010> have<00:03:33.160> another<00:03:33.400> look<00:03:33.640> but

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
it around and you have another look but

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.180 
it around and you have another look but
a<00:03:34.060> really<00:03:34.390> little<00:03:34.600> one<00:03:34.750> and<00:03:34.930> then<00:03:35.560> the<00:03:35.709> ends

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
a really little one and then the ends

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.229 
a really little one and then the ends
you<00:03:36.430> put<00:03:36.670> through<00:03:36.910> this<00:03:37.030> little<00:03:37.450> loop<00:03:37.690> and

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
you put through this little loop and

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.270 
you put through this little loop and
you're<00:03:40.239> gonna<00:03:40.510> have<00:03:40.780> something<00:03:41.320> pretty<00:03:41.920> like

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
you're gonna have something pretty like

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.699 
you're gonna have something pretty like
this<00:03:42.549> I<00:03:42.790> usually<00:03:43.450> wear<00:03:43.959> my<00:03:43.989> scarf<00:03:44.530> like<00:03:44.650> this

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
this I usually wear my scarf like this

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:46.380 
this I usually wear my scarf like this
one<00:03:45.040> it's<00:03:45.160> really<00:03:45.220> going<00:03:45.730> to<00:03:45.820> keep<00:03:45.970> this<00:03:46.150> area

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
one it's really going to keep this area

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.370 
one it's really going to keep this area
warm<00:03:46.870> and<00:03:48.360> again<00:03:49.360> it<00:03:49.600> looks<00:03:49.780> different<00:03:50.110> on

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
warm and again it looks different on

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.750 
warm and again it looks different on
different<00:03:50.440> scarves<00:03:51.190> that<00:03:51.280> you<00:03:51.400> might<00:03:51.580> look

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
different scarves that you might look

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.850 
different scarves that you might look
pretty<00:03:51.820> or<00:03:52.330> a<00:03:52.420> chunkier<00:03:53.049> with<00:03:53.500> a<00:03:53.530> thicker

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
pretty or a chunkier with a thicker

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.220 
pretty or a chunkier with a thicker
scarf<00:03:54.250> but<00:03:54.459> I'm<00:03:54.610> using<00:03:54.790> this<00:03:55.060> sort<00:03:55.900> of<00:03:55.959> fabric

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
scarf but I'm using this sort of fabric

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.750 
scarf but I'm using this sort of fabric
because<00:03:56.590> it's<00:03:56.739> not<00:03:56.890> too<00:03:57.070> thick<00:03:57.280> or<00:03:57.459> not<00:03:57.610> too

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
because it's not too thick or not too

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.240 
because it's not too thick or not too
thin<00:03:58.030> so<00:03:58.630> this<00:03:58.840> one<00:03:58.989> is<00:03:59.140> a<00:03:59.170> double<00:03:59.410> parisian

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
thin so this one is a double parisian

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.259 
thin so this one is a double parisian
not<00:04:00.750> another<00:04:01.750> way<00:04:02.049> to<00:04:02.110> wear<00:04:02.500> a<00:04:02.530> scarf<00:04:02.980> is<00:04:03.280> i

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
not another way to wear a scarf is i

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:06.600 
not another way to wear a scarf is i
call<00:04:04.750> it<00:04:04.870> a<00:04:04.959> wrap<00:04:05.200> around<00:04:05.260> so<00:04:05.920> what<00:04:06.100> you<00:04:06.250> do<00:04:06.430> is

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
call it a wrap around so what you do is

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.910 
call it a wrap around so what you do is
just<00:04:06.640> drape<00:04:07.420> the<00:04:07.660> scarf<00:04:07.810> around<00:04:08.320> your<00:04:08.620> neck

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
just drape the scarf around your neck

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.699 
just drape the scarf around your neck
and<00:04:09.269> then<00:04:10.269> you'll<00:04:10.510> just<00:04:10.720> kind<00:04:11.230> of<00:04:11.290> pull<00:04:11.590> it

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
and then you'll just kind of pull it

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:15.030 
and then you'll just kind of pull it
down<00:04:11.980> and<00:04:12.280> then<00:04:12.720> you'll<00:04:13.720> go<00:04:14.049> and<00:04:14.380> wrap<00:04:14.830> it

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
down and then you'll go and wrap it

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.000 
down and then you'll go and wrap it
around<00:04:16.169> so<00:04:17.169> you'll<00:04:17.380> have<00:04:17.590> something<00:04:17.830> like

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
around so you'll have something like

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.690 
around so you'll have something like
this<00:04:18.750> now<00:04:19.750> with<00:04:20.229> this<00:04:20.470> version<00:04:20.799> you<00:04:21.220> can<00:04:21.489> wear

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
this now with this version you can wear

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:22.480 
this now with this version you can wear
three

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
three

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.219 
three
way<00:04:22.639> so<00:04:22.699> it's<00:04:23.030> sort<00:04:23.240> of<00:04:23.300> one<00:04:23.539> version<00:04:23.750> but<00:04:24.139> you

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:24.229 
way so it's sort of one version but you

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:26.740 
way so it's sort of one version but you
can<00:04:24.440> split<00:04:25.250> this<00:04:25.430> version<00:04:25.819> in<00:04:25.940> three<00:04:26.210> more<00:04:26.479> so

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
can split this version in three more so

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.050 
can split this version in three more so
you<00:04:26.810> can<00:04:27.020> just<00:04:27.169> leave<00:04:27.319> it<00:04:27.349> like<00:04:27.620> that<00:04:27.669> but<00:04:28.669> it's

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
you can just leave it like that but it's

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.939 
you can just leave it like that but it's
kind<00:04:29.150> of<00:04:29.330> boring<00:04:29.539> so<00:04:29.750> what<00:04:29.960> I<00:04:29.990> do<00:04:30.139> is<00:04:30.500> usually<00:04:30.710> I

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:30.949 
kind of boring so what I do is usually I

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:33.189 
kind of boring so what I do is usually I
take<00:04:31.280> one<00:04:31.490> of<00:04:31.520> the<00:04:31.699> ends<00:04:31.849> and<00:04:32.180> I<00:04:32.599> bring<00:04:33.050> it

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:33.199 
take one of the ends and I bring it

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:35.260 
take one of the ends and I bring it
through<00:04:33.349> the<00:04:33.530> loop<00:04:33.710> and<00:04:33.889> usually<00:04:34.849> I<00:04:34.910> just<00:04:35.150> go

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
through the loop and usually I just go

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.830 
through the loop and usually I just go
like<00:04:35.300> this<00:04:35.800> or<00:04:36.800> you<00:04:37.669> can<00:04:37.819> go<00:04:38.000> ahead<00:04:38.120> and<00:04:38.479> do<00:04:38.660> one

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
like this or you can go ahead and do one

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.469 
like this or you can go ahead and do one
more<00:04:38.870> thing<00:04:39.080> is<00:04:39.530> take<00:04:39.800> this<00:04:40.009> end<00:04:40.340> and<00:04:40.460> put<00:04:41.360> it

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:41.479 
more thing is take this end and put it

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:45.550 
more thing is take this end and put it
through<00:04:41.660> this<00:04:42.349> loop<00:04:42.650> and<00:04:43.389> then<00:04:44.389> you<00:04:45.259> just<00:04:45.440> have

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
through this loop and then you just have

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.189 
through this loop and then you just have
something<00:04:45.800> pretty<00:04:46.160> like<00:04:46.460> this<00:04:46.780> very<00:04:47.780> cute
