okay so one either the Koala was blocked

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.020 
okay so one either the Koala was blocked
up<00:02:22.350> and<00:02:23.989> bamboo<00:02:24.989> has<00:02:25.230> those<00:02:25.500> has<00:02:26.069> those<00:02:26.430> joints

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
up and bamboo has those has those joints

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.320 
up and bamboo has those has those joints
in<00:02:27.209> between<00:02:27.630> as<00:02:28.050> it<00:02:28.319> grows<00:02:28.500> as<00:02:28.950> a<00:02:29.640> joint<00:02:30.030> kind

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
between the joints and because it's so

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.440 
between the joints and because it's so
solid<00:02:34.380> in<00:02:34.680> and<00:02:35.220> we<00:02:35.459> just<00:02:35.489> send<00:02:35.849> it<00:02:36.030> off<00:02:36.150> smooth

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
solid in and we just send it off smooth

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.009 
solid in and we just send it off smooth
it<00:02:36.599> all<00:02:36.750> off<00:02:36.900> and<00:02:37.769> then<00:02:37.830> we<00:02:38.069> put<00:02:38.250> a<00:02:38.280> hole<00:02:38.550> right

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
it all off and then we put a hole right

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:41.479 
it all off and then we put a hole right
behind<00:02:40.019> the<00:02:40.230> back<00:02:40.380> of<00:02:40.410> the<00:02:40.650> hip<00:02:40.890> with<00:02:41.130> sealed

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
behind the back of the hip with sealed

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:41.840 
behind the back of the hip with sealed
off

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
off

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.289 
off
maybe<00:02:42.540> we<00:02:42.810> used<00:02:43.019> our<00:02:43.140> finger<00:02:43.560> joints<00:02:44.060> to<00:02:45.060> Mack

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
maybe we used our finger joints to Mack

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:49.340 
maybe we used our finger joints to Mack
off<00:02:46.610> where<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:47.730> other<00:02:47.880> holes<00:02:48.150> go<00:02:48.450> so<00:02:48.959> if<00:02:49.049> I<00:02:49.170> use

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
off where the other holes go so if I use

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.100 
off where the other holes go so if I use
my<00:02:49.560> fingers<00:02:49.950> on<00:02:50.130> index<00:02:50.519> finger<00:02:50.940> and<00:02:51.540> the<00:02:51.840> first

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
my fingers on index finger and the first

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.620 
my fingers on index finger and the first
three<00:02:52.350> took<00:02:53.040> of<00:02:53.160> the<00:02:53.220> finger<00:02:53.610> in<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.120> next<00:02:54.510> two

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
three took of the finger in the next two

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.800 
three took of the finger in the next two
joints<00:02:55.049> along<00:02:55.290> okay<00:02:56.190> I<00:02:56.400> don't<00:02:57.030> mean<00:02:57.150> like<00:02:57.420> that

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
joints along okay I don't mean like that

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.350 
joints along okay I don't mean like that
halfway<00:02:58.380> between<00:02:58.769> the<00:02:59.220> flip<00:02:59.459> and<00:02:59.760> he<00:03:00.090> go

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
halfway between the flip and he go

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.800 
halfway between the flip and he go
either<00:03:00.780> side<00:03:01.140> of<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.410> halfway<00:03:01.769> back<00:03:02.720> now<00:03:03.720> I'll

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
either side of the halfway back now I'll

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.140 
either side of the halfway back now I'll
just<00:03:03.870> play<00:03:04.170> your<00:03:04.319> little<00:03:04.470> chick<00:03:04.799> on<00:03:05.459> motor<00:03:05.819> the
