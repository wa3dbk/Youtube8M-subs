00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
going to be worth because there's less

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.190 
going to be worth because there's less
of<00:03:34.890> them<00:03:35.130> circulating<00:03:35.700> around<00:03:35.930> in<00:03:36.930> order<00:03:37.140> to

what the mouth

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.110 
what the mouth
was<00:03:39.530> make<00:03:39.770> sure<00:03:39.800> that<00:03:39.980> you<00:03:40.430> saw<00:03:40.610> them<00:03:40.820> above

was make sure that you saw them above
that<00:03:41.300> Mel<00:03:41.510> can't<00:03:41.720> leave<00:03:41.900> right<00:03:42.200> and<00:03:42.500> also<00:03:42.650> I

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
that Mel can't leave right and also I

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.800 
that Mel can't leave right and also I
noticed<00:03:43.790> that<00:03:44.090> each<00:03:44.210> one<00:03:44.360> of<00:03:44.420> these<00:03:44.540> coins

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
noticed that each one of these coins

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.350 
noticed that each one of these coins
have<00:03:45.110> a<00:03:45.310> kind<00:03:46.310> of<00:03:46.400> a<00:03:46.490> coating<00:03:46.910> on<00:03:47.030> them<00:03:47.210> which

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
have a kind of a coating on them which

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.390 
have a kind of a coating on them which
is<00:03:47.440> ms-64<00:03:48.440> exactly<00:03:48.890> that<00:03:49.040> would<00:03:49.190> mean<00:03:49.370> that

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
is ms-64 exactly that would mean that

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.850 
is ms-64 exactly that would mean that
this<00:03:49.670> coin<00:03:49.910> has<00:03:50.090> been<00:03:50.240> uncirculated<00:03:50.860> means

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
this coin has been uncirculated means

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.830 
this coin has been uncirculated means
that<00:03:52.070> the<00:03:52.190> wear<00:03:52.400> on<00:03:52.430> this<00:03:52.760> coin<00:03:52.970> is<00:03:53.030> not<00:03:53.570> much

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
that the wear on this coin is not much

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.690 
that the wear on this coin is not much
so<00:03:54.290> it's<00:03:54.440> a<00:03:54.500> really<00:03:54.680> good<00:03:54.920> condition<00:03:55.100> and<00:03:55.520> it's

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
so it's a really good condition and it's

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.820 
so it's a really good condition and it's
able<00:03:56.210> to<00:03:56.390> solve<00:03:56.690> more<00:03:57.350> than<00:03:57.560> its<00:03:57.710> own

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:57.830 
able to solve more than its own

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.610 
able to solve more than its own
counterpart<00:03:58.400> that<00:03:58.610> at<00:03:58.760> the<00:03:58.940> same<00:03:59.120> year<00:03:59.620> with
