00:00:00.059 --> 00:00:03.530
 that has nice version when you made the bus it lubricates birds as you feel 

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:04.310
 gave 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:05.410
 boys 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.499
 but nice that I made this also a somewhat lesser game 

00:00:09.499 --> 00:00:14.269
 mistake and the first minute I think the ball I had not sail then 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:15.179
 thought that 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.909
 therefore better be able to kick them all away 

00:00:17.909 --> 00:00:20.310
 I can see everyone smoothly 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.210
 but hey that's the start is the match thanks to couples then not that 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.880
 found a new couch on it and the game on to the flames 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.319
 and ensure that competition work starts 

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:34.140
 and there were those that put a bit of tension on him 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.300
 just the art of fib nl 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.920
 after both but I also think it is not a mirror that can be used again 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.220
 train this then but for those not sprayed the training though 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.280
 it may be a bit but I have more time on myself to make a serious mistake 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.300
 is not coming anymore and is not coming this year at all 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.600
 Inholland you made your debut with more birds as you feel the kickoff 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.080
 and 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.409
 what is my feeling afterwards 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:02.580
 he hit the entire cluster of course 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.120
 substandard pot placed on the mat that I think you can't do that again 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.120
 heavy lifting because it is the first competition a week of training 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.110
 I have this case what we have done some more training and you see what 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.080
 what else has to play on the quays 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.180
 so it's still time enough to work on and 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.310
 so in that regard most are labeled a beautiful sports country 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.090
 and on the other hand yes also this of course gives very happy then the two first 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.570
 competition vaes put more of it on it 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.460
 how did it go your own personal station 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.210
 yes reasonable I mean that was not on st 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.830
 that wasn't super good either but the police hopes people are so hard to get themselves 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:41.560
 in front of 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.630
 but rise above it 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.340
 lasts all together and 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.000
 You also notice that I myself am still getting used to the players and it 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.370
 comes with temporary though but all in all I'm glad it can grab an overclock 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.050
 the land for once bebig made asmi go according to rouvoet 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.130
 c 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.190
 yeah good start say nothing that's a bit cynical of course 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.190
 That can mean stupid things behind one 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.199
 yes that is never nice and then just a bit messy 

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:12.149
 the Pakistani is finally counting 

00:02:12.149 --> 00:02:13.189
 and 

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:15.869
 yes they say they are on the bar and 

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:17.519
 opportunities created 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.039
 I am not dissatisfied, but neither 

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:23.929
 Of course we also played a game of the city before the summer 

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:25.909
 has never been a point 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:27.649
 after that the 

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:30.529
 thereby a little more satisfied than this competition makes 

00:02:30.529 --> 00:02:33.159
 jade are starting points 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:36.840
 and your own competition if you are researching how you look 

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:40.899
 yes i am not very disappointing game involved and haag 

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:47.849
 made major mistakes and I mean we have the coming weeks to get ahead 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:50.009
 prepare so I'm not worried 

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:52.979
 I propose the proposal round all the trend that the midfielder is 

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:54.929
 Midfielder you are your qualities 

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:57.239
 but I am a midfield with a lot of depth 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.610
 i like to close but attacking both strikers time 

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:04.519
 and of course I have my defensive duties in midfield both 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:09.729
 attackers defender and in terms of condition is also good so yes I love 

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:12.889
 just from attacks of support and good passing 

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:17.559
 Sometimes, of course, slightly inferior quality you need to improve and 

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:21.779
 the kind that I sometimes like to get close to the point that I sometimes do 

00:03:21.779 --> 00:03:23.579
 a little early or 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:28.019
 a little too quickly over the defenses of the opponent and just there 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.449
 have had no trouble learning how to dose 

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:32.219
 if you do it you do it now 

00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:36.829
 trained a little bit there every week for creditors that is feeling the yesterday 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:38.379
 travel world yes nice 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:39.579
 also a yes 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:43.470
 the club seems like a good sport to me I also look at the numbers now 

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:45.999
 again today a big game against 

00:03:45.999 --> 00:03:50.749
 yes certainly a good impression came after the post level wretched what I used to that 

00:03:50.749 --> 00:03:52.869
 the funnel more towards it 

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:56.069
 a group of people are nice people every year 

00:03:56.859 --> 00:04:00.119
 yes i am just looking forward to this year i just hope to get something 

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:03.119
 I couldn't do it for them 

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:06.460
 and you have counsel for all provinces 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.019
 smoked training sessions also closed at night 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:10.759
 yes etherea yes i do 

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:13.099
 I can't complain about that anymore 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:16.150
 how do you dislike the adjustment what you say own that started with the 

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:18.909
 four-grader shorter 

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:23.050
 Now as more birds you feel that you are a bit near the level 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.919
 see what has been asked 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:31.509
 yes it is indeed the weather very different the training it is the how the 

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:34.260
 trainer also talk about football so yes 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.320
 for that matter, I do not have the education that everyone has had 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.139
 a pity for me is only learners otherwise the more beautiful 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.080
 who train and the soccer player 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.990
 already done so far nothing wrong between is quite a bit 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.150
 what drive and what driving away 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.610
 see the game in your boat for this yes then we have to talk about it 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.830
 especially from companies and because also on hits and 

00:04:56.809 --> 00:04:58.360
 I have to 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.449
 in the ten meters and for that I have to be what I players like 

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:05.580
 if you are also special that today the boys are sitting 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.610
 the course as special it is the club where you know for sure played football for years 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:10.069
 became 

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:11.249
 m 

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:15.249
 yes we do develop a bit if you really play a lot of football 

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:19.509
 and now stepped up for this and both clubs see which courses 

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:21.310
 come and we prove 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:22.809
 ijsselmeer birds 

00:05:22.809 --> 00:05:27.139
 where through the main reasons for indeed boys utrecht the asking price 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:28.099
 had more 

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:32.869
 and then with the FC Utrecht that will not further develop the final agreement 

00:05:32.869 --> 00:05:35.960
 to think along quietly and as japan 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.430
 if there has been play I am the standard that you have to 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.610
 develop its products afterwards 

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:47.539
 well then you go looking for other ways and if more pro costs but already 

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:48.069
 must get quickly
