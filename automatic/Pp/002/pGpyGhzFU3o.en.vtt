00:00:03.349 --> 00:00:06.505
 To create a lightning fast catwalk style 

00:00:08.021 --> 00:00:14.245
 Now we have crawled all the hair, and it gets amazingly airy and beautiful. 

00:00:15.331 --> 00:00:20.034
 First we need to make a simple styling, a curly rockabilie styling. 

00:00:20.316 --> 00:00:28.048
 For this we need four of these hairpins. Closed hairpins. 

00:00:36.491 --> 00:00:45.863
 We lift up all the hair on the ice a bit and attach it with a clamp. 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:57.753
 Takes hold of everything side-hair, but retains the structure of the crawling. 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.736
 And shape it a little. 

00:01:03.007 --> 00:01:10.212
 Finally, we take a hairpin and put it in from below and up. 

00:01:11.787 --> 00:01:21.689
 And take another closed hairpin and put it across the other. 

00:01:26.551 --> 00:01:27.707
 Hope you can see it? 

00:01:32.765 --> 00:01:35.063
 We do exactly the same on the other side. 

00:01:37.201 --> 00:01:45.002
 The hair that remains can be styled in the neck and a little owl. 

00:01:48.374 --> 00:01:52.249
 So now the hair is in all directions, and it is important to shape it. 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.310
 Put in a little bit of it. 

00:01:58.675 --> 00:02:01.280
 Pull out the structure also in the neck. 

00:02:08.077 --> 00:02:18.204
 Now there is just a little spray missing and attaching the hair with some open hairpins. 

00:02:19.244 --> 00:02:28.844
 That looks like this. You stick in here, and then you bend one leg, then they are stuck. 

00:02:30.108 --> 00:02:33.094
 Very easy to shape the hair just as you like. 

00:02:35.261 --> 00:02:37.825
 Put your hair the way you like it best. 

00:02:41.499 --> 00:02:44.777
 Use dry hair spray to make the hair shape. 

00:02:49.516 --> 00:02:53.827
 Either you do a lot or a little out of it. Here I choose to exaggerate the volume a little. 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:09.575
 The open hairpins here must just be inserted so that they stay on the whole. 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.736
 It seems nice to let a little hair hang loose here and there, I think. 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:34.331
 Use hairpins to keep the shape. Let some hairstyles hang down. 

00:03:57.512 --> 00:03:58.967
 Often it is enough to fingertips. 

00:03:59.733 --> 00:04:08.746
 Ie Pull the hair a little and then spray it to maintain the slightly dry structure that you want. 

00:04:13.236 --> 00:04:15.997
 A little exaggerated, but should there be a party or what? 

00:04:18.578 --> 00:04:22.948
 That's how it is. Now we take it down here and try again.
