depicting what skatopia is like you know
that's<00:03:02.430> pretty<00:03:02.700> long<00:03:02.970> yeah<00:03:04.010> and<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.160> thing

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
that's pretty long yeah and the thing

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.520 
that's pretty long yeah and the thing
about<00:03:05.550> it<00:03:05.700> too<00:03:05.910> is<00:03:05.940> if<00:03:06.420> you<00:03:06.600> really<00:03:07.050> pay<00:03:07.260> close

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
about it too is if you really pay close

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.490 
about it too is if you really pay close
attention<00:03:07.769> to<00:03:08.400> it<00:03:09.000> the<00:03:09.269> movie<00:03:09.630> skips<00:03:10.079> around

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
attention to it the movie skips around

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.039 
attention to it the movie skips around
and<00:03:10.860> time<00:03:11.190> I<00:03:11.700> guess<00:03:11.970> it's<00:03:12.120> not<00:03:12.209> car<00:03:12.450> logical

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
and time I guess it's not car logical

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:15.140 
and time I guess it's not car logical
order<00:03:13.350> so<00:03:13.890> shows<00:03:14.160> him<00:03:14.370> screaming<00:03:14.670> so<00:03:14.970> I'd

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
order so shows him screaming so I'd

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.539 
order so shows him screaming so I'd
common<00:03:15.570> trait<00:03:15.810> that<00:03:15.989> they<00:03:16.049> poured<00:03:16.500> and<00:03:16.920> then

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
common trait that they poured and then

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.030 
common trait that they poured and then
another's<00:03:18.299> next<00:03:18.720> scene<00:03:18.870> shows<00:03:19.140> them<00:03:19.410> like

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
another's next scene shows them like

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.500 
another's next scene shows them like
digging<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:21.030> dirt<00:03:21.209> for<00:03:21.570> house<00:03:22.940> so<00:03:23.940> it<00:03:24.060> kind<00:03:24.329> of

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
digging the dirt for house so it kind of

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.900 
digging the dirt for house so it kind of
skips<00:03:25.230> around<00:03:25.380> a<00:03:25.680> little<00:03:25.920> bit<00:03:26.130> which<00:03:26.400> is<00:03:26.549> okay

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
skips around a little bit which is okay

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.090 
skips around a little bit which is okay
but<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.269> way<00:03:27.299> that<00:03:27.570> they<00:03:27.750> portray<00:03:28.500> it<00:03:28.680> is<00:03:28.829> it's

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
but the way that they portray it is it's

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.240 
but the way that they portray it is it's
from<00:03:29.910> day<00:03:30.120> one<00:03:30.480> when<00:03:31.079> it's<00:03:31.230> snowing<00:03:31.530> to<00:03:32.040> you

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
know the end of the year when it's

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.150 
know the end of the year when it's
snowing<00:03:33.989> and<00:03:34.290> he's<00:03:34.440> like<00:03:34.620> this<00:03:34.769> is<00:03:34.829> going<00:03:35.070> to

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.890 
snowing and he's like this is going to
be<00:03:35.250> the<00:03:35.370> best<00:03:35.519> year<00:03:35.820> ever<00:03:35.850> he<00:03:36.239> says<00:03:36.450> that<00:03:36.630> twice

so<00:03:37.260> so<00:03:38.010> that<00:03:38.250> part<00:03:38.459> of<00:03:38.579> its<00:03:38.700> a<00:03:38.850> little<00:03:39.209> bit

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
so so that part of its a little bit

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:41.300 
so so that part of its a little bit
shaky<00:03:39.840> but<00:03:39.870> some<00:03:40.380> of<00:03:40.470> the<00:03:40.530> best<00:03:40.709> bands<00:03:40.950> that

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
shaky but some of the best bands that

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.860 
shaky but some of the best bands that
play<00:03:41.489> there<00:03:41.760> they<00:03:41.940> should<00:03:42.000> show<00:03:42.540> either

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
play there they should show either

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.590 
play there they should show either
Dwayne<00:03:43.170> Peters<00:03:43.560> there<00:03:44.070> and<00:03:44.940> then<00:03:45.120> Tony<00:03:45.359> Hawk

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
Dwayne Peters there and then Tony Hawk

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.410 
Dwayne Peters there and then Tony Hawk
riding<00:03:46.200> I<00:03:46.410> think<00:03:46.709> Lance<00:03:46.859> mountain<00:03:47.070> was<00:03:47.370> there

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
riding I think Lance mountain was there

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.690 
riding I think Lance mountain was there
yeah<00:03:48.870> so<00:03:49.230> I<00:03:49.260> mean<00:03:49.440> they<00:03:49.560> they<00:03:50.040> definitely<00:03:50.370> were

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
yeah so I mean they they definitely were

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.640 
yeah so I mean they they definitely were
there<00:03:50.880> at<00:03:51.270> kind<00:03:51.750> of<00:03:51.810> a<00:03:51.870> high<00:03:52.050> point<00:03:52.350> of

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
there at kind of a high point of

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.330 
there at kind of a high point of
skatopia<00:03:53.459> in<00:03:53.790> terms<00:03:54.060> of<00:03:54.390> kind<00:03:54.750> of<00:03:54.840> mainstream

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
skatopia in terms of kind of mainstream

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.670 
skatopia in terms of kind of mainstream
tension<00:03:56.340> I<00:03:56.610> think<00:03:57.120> this<00:03:57.420> should<00:03:57.540> cut<00:03:58.080> more<00:03:58.560> out

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
tension I think this should cut more out

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.559 
tension I think this should cut more out
of<00:03:58.830> it<00:03:58.980> but<00:03:59.370> the<00:03:59.459> subject<00:03:59.850> matter<00:04:00.060> and<00:04:00.240> the

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
of it but the subject matter and the

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:02.750 
of it but the subject matter and the
video<00:04:00.930> is<00:04:00.959> all<00:04:01.200> good<00:04:01.410> it<00:04:01.920> did<00:04:02.160> seem<00:04:02.400> to<00:04:02.459> kind<00:04:02.640> of

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
video is all good it did seem to kind of

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.850 
video is all good it did seem to kind of
draw<00:04:03.000> and<00:04:03.300> draw<00:04:03.450> itself<00:04:03.810> out<00:04:04.020> a<00:04:04.050> little<00:04:04.260> bit<00:04:04.530> so

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
draw and draw itself out a little bit so

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.590 
draw and draw itself out a little bit so
I<00:04:04.890> guess<00:04:05.130> you<00:04:05.280> felt<00:04:05.490> I<00:04:05.640> give<00:04:05.880> it<00:04:05.970> 3<00:04:06.180> out<00:04:06.209> of<00:04:06.300> 5

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
I guess you felt I give it 3 out of 5

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.390 
I guess you felt I give it 3 out of 5
yeah<00:04:06.900> yeah<00:04:07.440> you<00:04:07.740> probably<00:04:07.950> would<00:04:08.070> have<00:04:08.190> more

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
yeah yeah you probably would have more

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.740 
yeah yeah you probably would have more
scenes<00:04:08.700> with<00:04:08.940> it

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.600 

maybe<00:04:12.750> even<00:04:13.050> like<00:04:13.320> I<00:04:13.530> don't<00:04:13.740> read<00:04:14.220> one<00:04:14.430> in

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
maybe even like I don't read one in

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:15.830 
maybe even like I don't read one in
where<00:04:14.790> they<00:04:14.880> made<00:04:15.060> out<00:04:15.239> for<00:04:15.420> the<00:04:15.510> earth<00:04:15.630> out

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
where they made out for the earth out

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.090 
where they made out for the earth out
that<00:04:17.989> it<00:04:18.989> wasn't<00:04:19.169> really<00:04:19.350> salmon<00:04:19.859> the<00:04:19.919> dog

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
that it wasn't really salmon the dog

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.640 
that it wasn't really salmon the dog
died<00:04:20.430> though<00:04:20.790> I'd<00:04:21.390> say<00:04:21.600> see<00:04:21.810> the<00:04:21.930> movie<00:04:22.260> if

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.440 
died though I'd say see the movie if
