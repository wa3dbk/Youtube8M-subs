00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
we're going to this is really to me a

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.219 
we're going to this is really to me a
super<00:01:06.350> deal<00:01:06.619> I<00:01:07.630> like<00:01:08.630> I<00:01:08.750> say<00:01:08.929> have<00:01:09.200> been

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
super deal I like I say have been

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.779 
super deal I like I say have been
looking<00:01:09.799> and<00:01:11.350> it<00:01:12.350> has<00:01:12.619> reverse<00:01:13.189> in<00:01:13.460> it<00:01:13.579> which

00:01:13.779 --> 00:01:13.789 
looking and it has reverse in it which

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:16.330 
looking and it has reverse in it which
was<00:01:14.060> very<00:01:14.509> different<00:01:14.749> for<00:01:15.020> a<00:01:15.079> motorcycle<00:01:15.770> like

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
was very different for a motorcycle like

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.849 
was very different for a motorcycle like
I<00:01:16.369> say<00:01:16.670> it<00:01:16.969> has<00:01:17.179> a<00:01:17.210> drive<00:01:17.569> shampoo<00:01:17.899> I<00:01:18.499> thought

00:01:18.849 --> 00:01:18.859 
I say it has a drive shampoo I thought

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:22.800 
I say it has a drive shampoo I thought
this<00:01:19.039> was<00:01:19.310> just<00:01:19.869> exactly<00:01:20.869> what<00:01:21.229> I<00:01:21.259> wanted<00:01:21.889> so

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
this was just exactly what I wanted so

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.399 
this was just exactly what I wanted so
the<00:01:23.810> thing<00:01:24.079> is<00:01:24.109> is<00:01:24.619> that<00:01:25.030> the<00:01:26.030> price<00:01:26.389> was<00:01:26.780> even

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
the thing is is that the price was even

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:30.129 
the thing is is that the price was even
better<00:01:27.740> than<00:01:28.100> I<00:01:28.219> thought<00:01:28.249> because<00:01:28.840> cars<00:01:29.840> are

00:01:30.129 --> 00:01:30.139 
better than I thought because cars are

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:33.969 
better than I thought because cars are
so<00:01:30.499> high<00:01:30.829> here<00:01:31.340> this<00:01:32.210> only<00:01:32.539> cost<00:01:33.109> eighty<00:01:33.560> one

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
so high here this only cost eighty one

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:37.420 
so high here this only cost eighty one
thousand<00:01:34.789> eight

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:43.360 

so<00:01:38.060> well<00:01:39.050> we<00:01:39.590> got<00:01:39.980> our<00:01:40.430> new<00:01:41.170> ride<00:01:42.170> home<00:01:42.680> it's

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:43.370 
so well we got our new ride home it's

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.340 
so well we got our new ride home it's
really<00:01:44.000> an<00:01:44.120> interesting<00:01:44.360> piece<00:01:45.050> with<00:01:45.320> a

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
really an interesting piece with a

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.920 
really an interesting piece with a
driveshaft<00:01:45.770> now<00:01:46.660> you<00:01:47.660> can<00:01:48.020> get<00:01:49.210> Reverse<00:01:50.210> so

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
driveshaft now you can get Reverse so

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.100 
driveshaft now you can get Reverse so
you<00:01:51.380> can<00:01:51.620> go<00:01:51.860> backwards<00:01:52.870> with<00:01:53.870> this

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
you can go backwards with this

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.740 
you can go backwards with this
