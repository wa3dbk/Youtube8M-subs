00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.820 

round<00:00:16.600> five<00:00:16.810> practice<00:00:17.260> we<00:00:17.380> made<00:00:17.529> a<00:00:17.560> few

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:17.830 
round five practice we made a few

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.440 
round five practice we made a few
changes<00:00:17.859> to<00:00:18.340> the<00:00:18.460> suspension<00:00:18.820> to<00:00:19.060> get<00:00:19.240> more

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:19.450 
changes to the suspension to get more

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.480 
changes to the suspension to get more
grip<00:00:19.660> we<00:00:20.350> also<00:00:20.500> change<00:00:20.860> the<00:00:20.980> gearing<00:00:21.220> in<00:00:21.400> the

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:21.490 
grip we also change the gearing in the

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:22.650 
grip we also change the gearing in the
differential<00:00:22.030> so<00:00:22.180> I<00:00:22.240> wouldn't<00:00:22.480> have<00:00:22.570> to

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:22.660 
differential so I wouldn't have to

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:32.630 
differential so I wouldn't have to
downshift<00:00:22.900> on<00:00:23.320> the<00:00:23.410> last<00:00:23.590> turn
