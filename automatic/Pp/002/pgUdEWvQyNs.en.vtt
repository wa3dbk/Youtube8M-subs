00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.210
 two 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.280
 Hello, we are here with rafa bouquets 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.740
 he is a micro computer technician and 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.919
 voip telephony specialist 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.689
 hello rafa hello how are we doing 

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:23.759
 you come to talk a little about the subject of 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.489
 the voip telephony tell me a little bit in 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:27.589
 What it consists consists in changing the 

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:30.599
 structure of traditional telephony 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:33.000
 for the structure of computing is 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.800
 say we went from telephone wires to 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.840
 centered in central in central until 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.940
 we arrive at the destination because we are going to 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.950
 something totally different we're going to 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.900
 connect through internet to get there 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.550
 directly to the destination and from 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.440
 there good then it is to have more fares 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.270
 cheap and also in the calls that 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.810
 be cheaper through the way 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.450
 traditional 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:55.440
 also integrate them inside our tv 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:58.530
 x our voip switchboard there is a certain 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.140
 confusion between voip telephony and 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.450
 skype theme here I have a headset 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.519
 typical of those we use as 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:08.219
 built-in microphone with this we talk 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.710
 by skype but with this we forget 

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:12.479
 when we talk about tele 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.740
 because what we're going through are telephones 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.720
 desktop 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.640
 Skype is fine but it's for another 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.320
 environment we do not need a computer 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.960
 we need to see that another person is 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.729
 connected and we already started talking 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.979
 the quality the sound is not too much 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.080
 good and it is also very difficult to carry 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.820
 to landlines and mobile phones 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.320
 In addition, the user experience is very 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.780
 different to traditional telephony is 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.580
 very complicated that a person who does not 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.409
 know of skype and only know of 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.360
 traditional telephony can use it 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.500
 here we talk about the same experience of 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.810
 user that is to say they are telephones 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.909
 exactly the same with rates 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.159
 much better than those that can 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.470
 offer traditional telephony and how 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.560
 I say everything is only optimize and 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.929
 make it cheaper parliament '11 of the 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.149
 costs for how much can you get a 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:59.909
 switchboard of this type a switchboard 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.830
 normal and current worth several thousand 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.350
 euros aside you have to invest a large 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.720
 amount of money in separate phones 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.910
 of everything there are several to the pricing is 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.860
 monthly is the first because of the 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.350
 services because the services that 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.940
 large bank separately 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.510
 caller ID answering machines 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.720
 etc 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.250
 and apart from all that the calls if 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.930
 well the other nationals are free 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.849
 mobile calls and calls 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.769
 international are usually very expensive in 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.989
 the voip telephony we can take a 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:30.450
 computer like this an old computer 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.489
 medium-low range and we can convert it 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.069
 through software that is also 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.659
 free in a switchboard that is to say we 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.250
 we have spent nothing we had already this 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:40.409
 computer and we already have our 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.409
 switchboard that if we would have to buy 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:44.879
 phones or use the old ones of the 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:47.280
 traditional telephony this for example 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:49.470
 is an ip phone that is perfectly 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.730
 trained to easily make 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.890
 all the functions of the new 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.780
 switchboard and as for the calls 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.459
 Well, it's much cheaper as 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.590
 we have said the calls through 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.579
 internet from an internet provider are 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.409
 much cheaper than a provider 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:04.200
 normal and we talk about calls to inter in 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:06.569
 the forgiveness of calls to destinations 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.670
 international and mobile destinations 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.989
 but the best thing is that the rates 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.420
 good that our supplier gives us 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.159
 traditional for the mere fact of having 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.989
 we can also integrate them 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:18.720
 inside our app x of our 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.519
 central ip well the truth that I am 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.900
 noting that there are many companies that 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.599
 they are already passing this guy 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.790
 telephony and one of the things that value 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:28.890
 is the cost of zero calls from 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.840
 calls between your offices if 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.030
 indeed it is one of the great 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.939
 advantages of voip telephony we can 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:38.700
 create a small network and that network is 

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:40.290
 connect in turn to a central node in 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.480
 insurance companies are a great big 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.040
 example because they are so many 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.079
 branches of very few people 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.200
 then each branch has its own 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:51.450
 network and binds to the node this could already be 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.370
 do in traditional telephony is 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.200
 say that all those little ones 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.269
 interviews connected to the central 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.560
 they will talk to each other and free what 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:01.230
 It happened that if one of those branches 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.790
 I was in another country the thing was shooting 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.670
 in terms of costs because obviously 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.500
 they started paying for calls 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.870
 international luck the great 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.209
 Voip telephony's capacity is 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.700
 It does not matter if you're in Badajoz 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:17.090
 you are in lisbon that you are in port that 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:20.340
 you are in andorra or that you are in marseilles 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.449
 you have a network you join them and that's it 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.250
 get all calls to be 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:25.349
 free if you get a network 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.389
 International you can do it 

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:28.500
 perfect you could talk to us you can 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:32.400
 talk to Brazil with him 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:35.610
 from Spain at zero cost and outside of that 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:38.940
 network what is to call from that company to 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:40.950
 another company what cost does it have in both 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.590
 national and international rates 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:45.270
 or mobiles we have already said that by the mere 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.860
 fact of having internet there are many 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.900
 providers that give you a series of 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.370
 minutes that give you a series of 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.590
 free services all that can be 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.030
 put inside the app x is silly 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.590
 try to fight against this service that 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.870
 it's free so directly the 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.220
 integral we integrate the advantage is in 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.710
 international calls and mobile 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.510
 it's an international call means 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.550
 in traditional telephony there is that 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:07.320
 go from the origin to the destination going 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.490
 by the switchboards it is true that 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.350
 National calls usually come out 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.419
 free but if it's international you 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.760
 They charge the whole journey so much 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:17.220
 be quite expensive with ip telephony what 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.680
 what is done is from the origin to the last 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.630
 central is reached free of charge thanks to 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.060
 internet and from there they already qualify us is 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:27.390
 say there is a company that is engaged in 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:29.340
 every place itself to charges but of course you 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:31.020
 It comes out very very cheap and that's why it can 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.120
 leave prices of a penny or two 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.090
 cents that is the price that usually 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.520
 Cost 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.110
 the call from fixed to fixed is mean 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.949
 hour talking to new york to two 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.040
 cents the minute 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:44.020
 it would be around 60 cents the 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.820
 I really like everything that 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.430
 I have been told I find it very interesting 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:50.260
 and what I would like us to talk about more 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.680
 go ahead and tell me a little bit about 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:55.600
 specific services that can be 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:57.130
 have with this type of switchboard 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.900
 true is perfect we will make another video 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:01.330
 where we will see all the services that it gives 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:04.440
 this switchboard for free because 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.440
 thank you very much rafa 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:14.100
 behind
