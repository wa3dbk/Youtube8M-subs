that I've been playing since I was about

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.510 
that I've been playing since I was about
10<00:02:58.150> I<00:02:59.100> came<00:03:00.100> out<00:03:00.280> in<00:03:01.380> 1989<00:03:02.380> and<00:03:02.920> I've<00:03:03.250> had<00:03:03.490> it

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 
10 I came out in 1989 and I've had it

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:10.290 
10 I came out in 1989 and I've had it
since<00:03:03.790> 1994<00:03:07.680> solid<00:03:08.680> tile<00:03:08.920> is<00:03:09.250> basically<00:03:10.180> a

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
since 1994 solid tile is basically a

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.420 
since 1994 solid tile is basically a
mahjong<00:03:10.870> type<00:03:11.680> game<00:03:11.980> where<00:03:12.160> you<00:03:12.250> select

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
mahjong type game where you select

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.509 
mahjong type game where you select
matching<00:03:12.790> tiles<00:03:13.650> but<00:03:14.650> the<00:03:15.010> difference<00:03:15.340> in

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
matching tiles but the difference in

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.270 
matching tiles but the difference in
this<00:03:15.700> version<00:03:16.360> is<00:03:16.690> it's<00:03:17.140> household<00:03:17.680> objects

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
this version is it's household objects

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.000 
this version is it's household objects
so<00:03:19.239> you<00:03:19.330> don't<00:03:19.510> have<00:03:19.630> to<00:03:19.810> guess<00:03:20.110> as<00:03:20.530> to<00:03:20.800> what

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
so you don't have to guess as to what

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.840 
so you don't have to guess as to what
each<00:03:21.269> Chinese<00:03:22.269> character<00:03:22.870> is<00:03:23.019> and<00:03:23.290> the<00:03:23.590> very

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
each Chinese character is and the very

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.370 
each Chinese character is and the very
subtleties<00:03:24.850> in<00:03:24.880> each<00:03:25.209> tile<00:03:25.720> so<00:03:25.989> it's<00:03:26.140> a<00:03:26.200> very

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
subtleties in each tile so it's a very
