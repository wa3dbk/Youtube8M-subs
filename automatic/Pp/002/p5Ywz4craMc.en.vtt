in<00:04:23.370> five<00:04:23.670> thousand<00:04:24.120> years<00:04:24.330> of<00:04:24.480> Chinese

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
in five thousand years of Chinese

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.570 
in five thousand years of Chinese
culture<00:04:25.020> there<00:04:25.680> are<00:04:25.710> just<00:04:25.920> so<00:04:26.100> many<00:04:26.220> stories

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
culture there are just so many stories

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.850 
culture there are just so many stories
but<00:04:26.850> to<00:04:27.510> find<00:04:27.780> one<00:04:28.020> that<00:04:28.230> can<00:04:28.380> be<00:04:28.500> used<00:04:28.530> on

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
but to find one that can be used on

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.190 
but to find one that can be used on
stage<00:04:29.220> is<00:04:29.460> actually<00:04:29.820> quite<00:04:30.030> difficult<00:04:30.210> it's

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
stage is actually quite difficult it's

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.690 
stage is actually quite difficult it's
not<00:04:31.410> like<00:04:31.560> with<00:04:31.680> a<00:04:31.710> play<00:04:31.980> where<00:04:32.220> actors<00:04:32.520> can

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
not like with a play where actors can

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.460 
not like with a play where actors can
say<00:04:32.910> lines<00:04:33.120> you<00:04:33.390> can<00:04:33.570> change<00:04:33.840> the<00:04:34.050> set<00:04:34.230> many

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
say lines you can change the set many

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.620 
say lines you can change the set many
times<00:04:34.740> in<00:04:35.070> dance<00:04:35.669> you<00:04:35.880> have<00:04:35.970> five<00:04:36.240> to<00:04:36.419> six

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
times in dance you have five to six

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.300 
times in dance you have five to six
minutes<00:04:36.930> to<00:04:37.050> tell<00:04:37.200> a<00:04:37.230> story<00:04:37.470> it<00:04:37.980> has<00:04:38.100> to<00:04:38.220> be

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
minutes to tell a story it has to be

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.370 
minutes to tell a story it has to be
very<00:04:38.520> condensed<00:04:39.030> concise<00:04:39.450> and<00:04:39.750> make<00:04:40.230> the
