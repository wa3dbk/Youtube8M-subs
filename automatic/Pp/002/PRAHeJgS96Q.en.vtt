00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
this button and we'll put in to create a

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.170 
this button and we'll put in to create a
motor<00:01:33.869> quick<00:01:36.619> behind<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.950> scenes<00:01:38.220> we<00:01:38.820> have<00:01:39.000> is

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
motor quick behind the scenes we have is

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.140 
motor quick behind the scenes we have is
set<00:01:39.360> up<00:01:39.590> where<00:01:40.590> we<00:01:40.920> have<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.340> series<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:41.820> chest

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
set up where we have a series of chest

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.149 
set up where we have a series of chest
that<00:01:42.689> would<00:01:43.020> obviously<00:01:43.170> feed<00:01:43.770> off<00:01:43.890> of<00:01:44.070> a

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
that would obviously feed off of a

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.830 
that would obviously feed off of a
sorting<00:01:44.520> system<00:01:44.820> of<00:01:44.939> some<00:01:45.090> some<00:01:45.509> type<00:01:45.689> that

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
sorting system of some some type that

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.399 
sorting system of some some type that
you<00:01:45.869> build<00:01:46.280> then<00:01:47.280> puts<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.450> single<00:01:48.780> item<00:01:48.930> into

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
you build then puts a single item into

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.590 
you build then puts a single item into
each<00:01:49.680> chest<00:01:50.070> that<00:01:50.549> you've<00:01:50.729> designated<00:01:50.909> so

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
each chest that you've designated so

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.639 
each chest that you've designated so
we've<00:01:51.899> got<00:01:52.049> logs<00:01:52.500> Cole<00:01:53.130> sticks<00:01:53.700> torches

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
we've got logs Cole sticks torches

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:58.370 
we've got logs Cole sticks torches
behind<00:01:55.649> those<00:01:55.829> we<00:01:56.070> have<00:01:56.189> trans<00:01:56.460> trans<00:01:57.380> posers

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
behind those we have trans trans posers

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.530 
behind those we have trans trans posers
I<00:01:58.500> believe<00:01:58.680> they're<00:01:58.799> called<00:01:59.240> that<00:02:00.240> are<00:02:00.390> hooked

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
I believe they're called that are hooked

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.050 
I believe they're called that are hooked
up<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:01.020> pneumatic<00:02:01.829> pipes<00:02:02.040> that<00:02:02.399> all<00:02:02.549> feed<00:02:02.790> into

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
up to pneumatic pipes that all feed into

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.480 
up to pneumatic pipes that all feed into
the<00:02:03.090> ender<00:02:03.360> chest

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
the ender chest

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.429 
the ender chest
and<00:02:04.850> attached<00:02:05.390> to<00:02:05.420> each<00:02:05.630> of<00:02:05.750> these<00:02:05.840> transposes

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
and attached to each of these transposes

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:08.529 
and attached to each of these transposes
is<00:02:06.649> a<00:02:06.680> wireless<00:02:07.250> receiver<00:02:07.399> on<00:02:07.909> its<00:02:08.390> own

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
is a wireless receiver on its own

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.050 
is a wireless receiver on its own
individual<00:02:09.470> frequencies<00:02:09.759> so<00:02:10.759> really<00:02:11.030> all

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
individual frequencies so really all

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.660 
individual frequencies so really all
you're<00:02:11.270> doing<00:02:11.630> is<00:02:11.810> sending<00:02:12.230> a<00:02:12.530> pulse<00:02:12.890> to<00:02:13.640> the

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
you're doing is sending a pulse to the

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.520 
you're doing is sending a pulse to the
corresponding<00:02:14.860> receiver<00:02:15.860> which<00:02:16.640> in<00:02:16.790> turn

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
corresponding receiver which in turn

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.870 
corresponding receiver which in turn
triggers<00:02:18.530> this<00:02:18.650> Transposer<00:02:19.130> to<00:02:19.340> send<00:02:19.550> an<00:02:19.640> item

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
triggers this Transposer to send an item

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.670

a world like world anchor which I do

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.330 
a world like world anchor which I do
suggest<00:02:31.489> in<00:02:31.849> all<00:02:32.000> cases<00:02:32.180> so<00:02:33.170> that<00:02:33.200> your<00:02:34.099> chunks

suggest in all cases so that your chunks

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.530 
suggest in all cases so that your chunks
are<00:02:34.430> always<00:02:34.610> loaded<00:02:34.730> up<00:02:35.000> assume<00:02:35.300> that's

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.449 
needed for this setup to work you could
also<00:02:38.690> set<00:02:38.959> up<00:02:39.049> a<00:02:39.140> room<00:02:39.319> where<00:02:39.590> you<00:02:40.250> have<00:02:40.430> your

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:22.629 
three times there that should get total

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:26.220 
three times there that should get total
of<00:03:22.690> three<00:03:22.840> more<00:03:22.989> six<00:03:24.569> anyway<00:03:25.569> just<00:03:26.110> thought

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
of three more six anyway just thought

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.380 
of three more six anyway just thought
that<00:03:26.349> was<00:03:26.560> a<00:03:26.620> pretty<00:03:27.310> neat<00:03:27.519> set<00:03:27.700> up<00:03:27.790> in<00:03:28.030> case

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
that was a pretty neat set up in case

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.890 
that was a pretty neat set up in case
you're<00:03:28.599> ever<00:03:28.629> mining<00:03:29.200> or<00:03:30.569> and<00:03:31.569> run<00:03:31.750> out<00:03:31.870> of

you're ever mining or and run out of

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.789 
you're ever mining or and run out of
resources<00:03:32.049> I<00:03:32.819> often<00:03:33.819> find<00:03:34.780> myself<00:03:34.930> forgetting
