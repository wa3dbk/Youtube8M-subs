00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.179
 Is an Iweon channel I purchased a long time ago and haven't even opened it yet 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.200
 I'm going to make hyper function lbx arches, so I'm opening this time 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.280
 Review 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:18.840
 What kind of thing is this hyperfunction in the first place ? 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.020
 In this way with the same Lucifer in hitting the master grade of what I say in the gunpla 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.000
 Also normal 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:28.270
 The texture of the lbx and the fiber function lbx is completely different. 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.169
 Toka or do a little huge trying to gloss 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:36.820
 The parts of the wings are completely different and proportions are also improved 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:40.010
 I can just buy an ordinary lbx with a ticket but I made this over 2000 yen 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:45.800
 In this time of the first installment of the hyper function 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:47.359
 lbx Achilles I know that strength is the first limited production version, so with Stilton 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:53.059
 Besides Achilles 

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:58.250
 The cover price of x00 has come out and the purchase price was certainly 600 yen after the war. 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:01:00.030
 The package looks like this and it looks pretty gorgeous compared to the usual Achilles 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.290
 Can I open it for the first time 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.250
 I did not even seal it 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.280
 that 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:10.670
 Ah ha ha ha ha than 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:17.130
 There is not so much part density 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:18.409
 But runner bag is checked 123 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.000
 Four 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:25.580
 I'm in high school 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.890
 Hyperfunction is completely reproduced in the sense of parts 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.760
 Almost 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:33.690
 It's there is no seal eh 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:41.430
 It is probably the one that comes with this is also custom 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:48.720
 And to mount is always a made of paper this is over there It is a cloth and a 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:49.750
 Well it is incredible This manual also has become a perfectly booklet I not 's error God 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.460
 Something 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:57.049
 It looks easy to make this look 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:02:01.250
 If you look at the manual , it looks like Kirick 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:04.520
 Because this hyperfunction Nun has already taken about one and a half hours or two hours 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:11.270
 I think this will probably take that much 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:12.450
 lbx is like this I'm I'm comfortable making it does not enter the effect unlike the Gundam 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.470
 I want to feel 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:20.310
 If you don't make this a good one, you'll soon have a narrow corner with cardboard 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:24.390
 There are fleets of tld and tie- per functions coming out. 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.590
 So, if you upload this detailed review video, it is actually attached to the explanatory note link 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:32.330
 More than 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:32.330
 Hyperfunction lbx Achilles pan was the open review of a 900 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.319
