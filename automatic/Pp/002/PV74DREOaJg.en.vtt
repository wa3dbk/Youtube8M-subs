 I'll tell you our whole story 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.590
 began in california 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.990
 around 1850 a French farmer 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.230
 named pellino uni a French plum 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:32.189

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.710
 they arrived at the third generation but 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.960

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.479
 they must not fall to the ground they must be picked 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.390

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.520
