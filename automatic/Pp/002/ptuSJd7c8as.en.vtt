so<00:00:08.340> there's<00:00:08.490> no<00:00:08.639> doubt<00:00:08.820> that<00:00:09.120> using<00:00:09.480> a

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
so there's no doubt that using a

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.020 
so there's no doubt that using a
secondary<00:00:10.019> monitor<00:00:10.260> is<00:00:10.830> an<00:00:11.070> amazing<00:00:11.580> boosted

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
secondary monitor is an amazing boosted

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.209 
secondary monitor is an amazing boosted
productivity<00:00:12.410> however<00:00:13.410> obviously<00:00:13.620> it<00:00:14.040> takes

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
productivity however obviously it takes

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.880 
productivity however obviously it takes
up<00:00:14.490> more<00:00:14.639> room<00:00:14.880> and<00:00:15.210> money<00:00:15.540> so<00:00:16.199> everyone<00:00:16.710> might

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
up more room and money so everyone might

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.130 
up more room and money so everyone might
not<00:00:17.039> have<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.730> money<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.420> spend<00:00:18.660> on<00:00:19.080> a

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
not have the money to spend on a

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.050 
not have the money to spend on a
secondary<00:00:19.529> monitor<00:00:19.770> but<00:00:20.520> today<00:00:20.760> I'm<00:00:20.910> going<00:00:21.000> to

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
secondary monitor but today I'm going to

your primary monitor all this stuff I've

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.130 
your primary monitor all this stuff I've
only<00:00:29.070> tested<00:00:29.640> with<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.300> tablet<00:00:30.929> running

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
only tested with a tablet running

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.590 
only tested with a tablet running
Android<00:00:31.260> lollipop<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.700> desktop<00:00:33.360> computer

running<00:00:37.440> KitKat<00:00:37.800> at<00:00:38.190> some<00:00:38.430> point<00:00:38.700> you'll

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
running KitKat at some point you'll

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.729 
running KitKat at some point you'll
understand<00:00:39.450> why<00:00:39.690> later<00:00:40.170> in<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.440> video

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
understand why later in the video

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.799 
understand why later in the video
anyway<00:00:41.280> virtually<00:00:41.790> all<00:00:41.969> of<00:00:42.000> these<00:00:42.239> solutions

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
anyway virtually all of these solutions

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.950 
anyway virtually all of these solutions
use<00:00:43.770> mainly<00:00:44.370> an<00:00:44.520> app<00:00:44.670> so<00:00:45.000> let's<00:00:45.420> just<00:00:45.629> run<00:00:45.809> down

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
use mainly an app so let's just run down

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.930 
use mainly an app so let's just run down
the<00:00:46.140> apps<00:00:46.289> I'm<00:00:46.559> going<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:46.829> be<00:00:46.890> tiny<00:00:47.070> phone<00:00:47.370> so

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
the apps I'm going to be tiny phone so

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.810 
the apps I'm going to be tiny phone so
first<00:00:48.270> off<00:00:48.480> is<00:00:48.750> I<00:00:48.899> display<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:49.680> display<00:00:50.190> is<00:00:50.579> an

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
first off is I display I display is an

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.310 
first off is I display I display is an
app<00:00:50.940> that's<00:00:51.239> specifically<00:00:51.809> designed<00:00:51.899> for

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
app that's specifically designed for

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.470 
app that's specifically designed for
this<00:00:52.469> purpose<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.820> works<00:00:54.059> pretty<00:00:54.300> well

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
this purpose and it works pretty well

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.600 
this purpose and it works pretty well
anyway<00:00:54.960> I'll<00:00:55.469> actually<00:00:55.710> get<00:00:56.039> into<00:00:56.160> tight<00:00:56.399> into

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
anyway I'll actually get into tight into

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.490 
anyway I'll actually get into tight into
that<00:00:56.730> Belva<00:00:57.149> in<00:00:57.510> more<00:00:57.750> detail<00:00:58.109> later

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
that Belva in more detail later

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.580 
that Belva in more detail later
the<00:00:58.920> next<00:00:59.280> is<00:00:59.399> graph<00:00:59.730> table<00:01:00.030> X<00:01:00.329> display<00:01:00.989> so

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
the next is graph table X display so

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.700 
the next is graph table X display so
this<00:01:01.949> is<00:01:02.160> sort<00:01:02.460> of<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:03.329> bit<00:01:03.719> like<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.290> actual

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
this is sort of a bit like the actual

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.620 
this is sort of a bit like the actual
Splashtop<00:01:05.280> app<00:01:05.489> but<00:01:05.850> if<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.270> don't<00:01:06.540> know

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
Splashtop app but if you don't know

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.560 
Splashtop app but if you don't know
about<00:01:06.869> was<00:01:07.049> like<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.229> remote<00:01:07.560> desktop

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
about was like a remote desktop

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.910 
about was like a remote desktop
application<00:01:09.570> that<00:01:09.600> lets<00:01:09.900> you<00:01:10.110> control<00:01:10.500> your

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
application that lets you control your

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.820 
application that lets you control your
computer<00:01:11.549> from<00:01:11.880> your<00:01:12.119> phone<00:01:12.479> so<00:01:13.409> it's<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.680> bit

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
computer from your phone so it's a bit

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.130 
computer from your phone so it's a bit
like<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:14.130> but<00:01:14.369> essentially<00:01:14.790> it's<00:01:15.299> only<00:01:15.900> a

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
like that but essentially it's only a

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.870 
like that but essentially it's only a
secretary<00:01:16.740> monitor<00:01:17.220> it's<00:01:17.340> not<00:01:17.490> showing

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
secretary monitor it's not showing

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.760 
secretary monitor it's not showing
what's<00:01:18.060> on<00:01:18.299> your<00:01:18.450> computer<00:01:18.990> it's<00:01:19.259> giving<00:01:19.650> you

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
what's on your computer it's giving you

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.100 
what's on your computer it's giving you
extra<00:01:20.130> screen<00:01:20.520> real<00:01:20.640> estate<00:01:20.909> then<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.930> last

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
extra screen real estate then the last

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.609 
extra screen real estate then the last
one<00:01:22.409> is<00:01:22.619> just<00:01:22.650> using<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.310> normal<00:01:23.850> Splashtop

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
one is just using the normal Splashtop

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:27.890 
one is just using the normal Splashtop
application<00:01:25.619> now<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:26.369> might<00:01:26.549> not<00:01:26.729> solve<00:01:27.689> like

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
application now you might not solve like

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.090 
application now you might not solve like
clock<00:01:28.229> how<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:28.650> would<00:01:28.860> work

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
clock how that would work

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.609 
clock how that would work
because<00:01:29.579> it's<00:01:30.030> actually<00:01:30.450> intended<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.350> use

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
because it's actually intended to use

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.310 
because it's actually intended to use
just<00:01:32.220> as<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.549> duplication<00:01:33.509> rating<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.170> your

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
just as a duplication rating of your

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.740 
just as a duplication rating of your
normal<00:01:34.740> display<00:01:35.130> so<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:35.909> can<00:01:36.119> see<00:01:36.329> on<00:01:36.600> the

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
normal display so the you can see on the

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.840 
normal display so the you can see on the
move<00:01:36.990> but<00:01:37.560> actually<00:01:37.950> maybe<00:01:38.159> showing<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.670> how

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
move but actually maybe showing you how

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.260 
move but actually maybe showing you how
you<00:01:38.909> can<00:01:39.210> use<00:01:39.479> that<00:01:40.140> application<00:01:40.320> as<00:01:41.270> just

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
you can use that application as just

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.569 
you can use that application as just
like<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:42.689> would<00:01:42.920> Splashtop<00:01:43.920> X<00:01:44.130> display

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
like you would Splashtop X display

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.249 
like you would Splashtop X display
because<00:01:44.970> there<00:01:45.149> are<00:01:45.270> limitations<00:01:45.960> to

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
because there are limitations to

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.889 
because there are limitations to
Splashtop<00:01:47.100> X<00:01:47.310> display<00:01:47.820> that<00:01:48.060> are<00:01:48.180> now<00:01:48.630> with

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
Splashtop X display that are now with

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.020 
Splashtop X display that are now with
the<00:01:49.049> normal<00:01:49.380> spot<00:01:49.619> star<00:01:49.829> so<00:01:50.130> first<00:01:50.610> up<00:01:50.850> I

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
the normal spot star so first up I

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.200 
the normal spot star so first up I
display<00:01:51.659> I<00:01:51.899> display<00:01:52.470> is<00:01:52.790> pretty<00:01:53.790> good<00:01:54.000> it

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
display I display is pretty good it

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.020 
display I display is pretty good it
works<00:01:54.450> well<00:01:54.810> however<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.950> only<00:01:56.070> downside<00:01:57.000> is

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
works well however the only downside is

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.209 
works well however the only downside is
that<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:57.600> does<00:01:57.990> not<00:01:58.200> work<00:01:58.500> with<00:01:58.829> Android

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
that it does not work with Android

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049

so<00:02:31.170> that's<00:02:31.440> a<00:02:31.620> little<00:02:31.799> bit<00:02:31.980> annoying<00:02:32.310> but

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
so that's a little bit annoying but

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.270 
so that's a little bit annoying but
within<00:02:33.090> that<00:02:33.450> it<00:02:33.629> works<00:02:33.840> greatly<00:02:34.530> I<00:02:34.830> mean<00:02:35.099> it

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
within that it works greatly I mean it

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.750 
within that it works greatly I mean it
does<00:02:35.519> cost<00:02:35.840> three<00:02:36.840> pounds<00:02:37.200> fifty<00:02:37.620> just<00:02:38.519> about

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
does cost three pounds fifty just about

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.360 
does cost three pounds fifty just about
on<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:39.000> Google<00:02:39.150> Play<00:02:39.480> Store<00:02:39.840> so<00:02:39.870> I<00:02:40.379> guess

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
on the Google Play Store so I guess

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.280 
on the Google Play Store so I guess
that's<00:02:41.519> worse<00:02:41.849> than<00:02:41.879> say<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.629> split<00:02:42.900> normal

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
that's worse than say the split normal

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.350 
that's worse than say the split normal

option<00:03:49.290> is<00:03:49.410> just<00:03:49.769> the<00:03:49.919> normal<00:03:50.280> splash<00:03:50.639> top<00:03:50.910> app

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
option is just the normal splash top app

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.509 
option is just the normal splash top app
so<00:03:51.900> people<00:03:52.319> who<00:03:52.410> use<00:03:52.440> flash<00:03:52.919> top<00:03:53.160> might<00:03:53.340> give

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
so people who use flash top might give

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.569 
so people who use flash top might give
it<00:03:53.669> wildered<00:03:54.630> as<00:03:55.019> to<00:03:55.319> how<00:03:55.590> you<00:03:55.650> can<00:03:55.980> use<00:03:56.310> this

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
it wildered as to how you can use this

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:58.520 
it wildered as to how you can use this
application<00:03:56.790> for<00:03:57.569> that<00:03:57.780> purpose<00:03:58.290> but

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
application for that purpose but

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.650 
application for that purpose but
basically<00:03:59.489> all<00:03:59.880> you've<00:04:00.000> got<00:04:00.180> to<00:04:00.269> do<00:04:00.389> is

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
basically all you've got to do is

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.170 
basically all you've got to do is
install<00:04:01.380> the<00:04:01.680> novel<00:04:02.160> splash<00:04:02.430> top<00:04:02.639> app<00:04:02.819> on<00:04:03.030> your

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
install the novel splash top app on your

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.449

tablet<00:04:03.239> phone<00:04:03.959> install<00:04:04.680> the<00:04:04.829> streamer<00:04:05.190> on

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
tablet phone install the streamer on

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.610 
tablet phone install the streamer on
your<00:04:05.609> computer<00:04:06.030> from<00:04:06.180> that<00:04:06.389> website<00:04:06.810> and<00:04:06.989> then

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
your computer from that website and then

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.159 
your computer from that website and then
to<00:04:07.950> achieve<00:04:08.069> actually<00:04:08.910> using<00:04:09.450> the<00:04:09.810> app<00:04:09.900> as<00:04:10.139> a

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:10.169 
to achieve actually using the app as a

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:12.860 
to achieve actually using the app as a
secondary<00:04:10.739> monitor<00:04:11.010> all<00:04:11.910> you<00:04:12.120> have<00:04:12.269> to<00:04:12.419> do<00:04:12.599> and

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
secondary monitor all you have to do and

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.289 
secondary monitor all you have to do and
I'm<00:04:13.200> cold<00:04:14.069> my<00:04:14.220> hands<00:04:14.430> up<00:04:14.549> and<00:04:14.609> say<00:04:14.819> this<00:04:14.970> might

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
I'm cold my hands up and say this might

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:17.909 
I'm cold my hands up and say this might
not<00:04:15.359> work<00:04:15.690> for<00:04:15.750> you<00:04:16.139> this<00:04:16.320> just<00:04:16.590> happened<00:04:17.070> work

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
not work for you this just happened work

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:20.129 
not work for you this just happened work
you<00:04:18.459> just<00:04:18.669> plug<00:04:18.909> in<00:04:19.030> an<00:04:19.239> adapter<00:04:19.840> he<00:04:19.930> might

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139 
you just plug in an adapter he might

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:22.260 
you just plug in an adapter he might
even<00:04:20.319> work<00:04:20.530> just<00:04:20.889> with<00:04:21.009> a<00:04:21.039> cable<00:04:21.579> into<00:04:22.060> an

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
even work just with a cable into an

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.409 
even work just with a cable into an
empty<00:04:23.099> graphics<00:04:24.099> output<00:04:24.430> port<00:04:24.969> on<00:04:25.360> your

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
empty graphics output port on your

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:27.119 
empty graphics output port on your
graphics<00:04:26.020> card<00:04:26.289> or<00:04:26.469> onion<00:04:26.710> with<00:04:26.860> the<00:04:26.889> board

00:04:27.119 --> 00:04:27.129 
graphics card or onion with the board

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:29.610 
graphics card or onion with the board
whichever<00:04:28.060> one<00:04:28.210> you're<00:04:28.389> using<00:04:28.629> and<00:04:28.960> then

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
whichever one you're using and then

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.709 
whichever one you're using and then
basically<00:04:30.490> the<00:04:30.610> computer<00:04:31.240> should<00:04:31.659> recognize

00:04:31.709 --> 00:04:31.719 
basically the computer should recognize

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:34.679 
basically the computer should recognize
it<00:04:32.560> don't<00:04:33.400> know<00:04:33.490> what<00:04:33.759> adapters<00:04:34.240> this<00:04:34.509> will

00:04:34.679 --> 00:04:34.689 
it don't know what adapters this will

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:37.529 
it don't know what adapters this will
work<00:04:34.840> with<00:04:35.189> but<00:04:36.189> it<00:04:36.460> worked<00:04:36.759> for<00:04:36.849> mine<00:04:37.150> and<00:04:37.389> it

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:37.539 
work with but it worked for mine and it

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:39.659 
work with but it worked for mine and it
just<00:04:37.749> recognizes<00:04:37.990> it<00:04:38.439> actually<00:04:38.860> as<00:04:39.009> a<00:04:39.039> monitor

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
just recognizes it actually as a monitor

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:43.170 
just recognizes it actually as a monitor
and<00:04:40.080> it<00:04:41.080> doesn't<00:04:41.379> I<00:04:41.620> guess<00:04:41.979> anti<00:04:42.610> anything<00:04:42.819> to

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
and it doesn't I guess anti anything to

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.019 
and it doesn't I guess anti anything to
it<00:04:43.300> because<00:04:43.689> there's<00:04:44.680> for<00:04:45.550> the<00:04:45.610> computer

00:04:46.019 --> 00:04:46.029 
it because there's for the computer

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:47.189 
it because there's for the computer
there's<00:04:46.270> not<00:04:46.419> actually<00:04:46.539> anything<00:04:47.020> on<00:04:47.110> the

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:47.199 
there's not actually anything on the

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:49.230 
there's not actually anything on the
other<00:04:47.379> end<00:04:47.529> of<00:04:47.620> the<00:04:47.710> wire<00:04:47.830> but<00:04:48.099> in<00:04:48.310> your<00:04:48.729> screen

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
other end of the wire but in your screen

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.179 
other end of the wire but in your screen
resolution<00:04:49.479> settings<00:04:50.349> and<00:04:50.529> stuff<00:04:50.770> the

00:04:51.179 --> 00:04:51.189 
resolution settings and stuff the

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:53.519 
resolution settings and stuff the
secondary<00:04:51.550> monitor<00:04:51.969> does<00:04:52.270> pop<00:04:52.569> up<00:04:52.599> so<00:04:53.439> all

00:04:53.519 --> 00:04:53.529 
secondary monitor does pop up so all

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:55.230 
secondary monitor does pop up so all
you've<00:04:53.680> got<00:04:53.830> to<00:04:53.949> do<00:04:54.039> now<00:04:54.310> is<00:04:54.610> go<00:04:54.909> into<00:04:55.090> the

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
you've got to do now is go into the

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.939 
you've got to do now is go into the
splash<00:04:55.479> drop<00:04:55.689> app<00:04:55.900> and<00:04:56.139> switch<00:04:56.560> to<00:04:56.860> the

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:56.949 
splash drop app and switch to the

00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:59.809 
splash drop app and switch to the
secondary<00:04:57.490> monitor<00:04:57.810> Neil<00:04:58.810> the<00:04:59.020> monitor<00:04:59.500> and

00:04:59.809 --> 00:04:59.819 
secondary monitor Neil the monitor and

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:02.730 
secondary monitor Neil the monitor and
which<00:05:00.819> is<00:05:01.000> a<00:05:01.029> button<00:05:01.479> in<00:05:01.750> the<00:05:02.080> splash<00:05:02.319> top<00:05:02.529> app

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
which is a button in the splash top app

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.890 
which is a button in the splash top app
which<00:05:03.430> is<00:05:03.639> designed<00:05:04.029> for<00:05:04.330> a<00:05:04.389> guest<00:05:04.599> people

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
which is designed for a guest people

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.719 
which is designed for a guest people
with<00:05:05.020> drill<00:05:05.259> monitor<00:05:05.590> setups<00:05:06.009> but<00:05:06.250> you<00:05:06.430> can

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:06.729 
with drill monitor setups but you can

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:09.149 
with drill monitor setups but you can
actually<00:05:06.909> sort<00:05:07.360> of<00:05:07.389> cheat<00:05:07.719> and<00:05:08.229> use<00:05:08.529> it<00:05:08.680> as<00:05:08.860> a

00:05:09.149 --> 00:05:09.159 
actually sort of cheat and use it as a

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:11.040 
actually sort of cheat and use it as a
secondary<00:05:09.639> monitor<00:05:09.879> now<00:05:10.360> I'm<00:05:10.719> aware<00:05:10.990> that

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
secondary monitor now I'm aware that

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.200 
secondary monitor now I'm aware that
obviously<00:05:11.469> this<00:05:11.650> really<00:05:12.129> isn't<00:05:12.310> designed<00:05:12.849> for

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
obviously this really isn't designed for

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:14.899 
obviously this really isn't designed for
this<00:05:13.360> purpose<00:05:13.419> but<00:05:14.139> for<00:05:14.199> me<00:05:14.560> actually

00:05:14.899 --> 00:05:14.909 
this purpose but for me actually

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:17.219 
this purpose but for me actually
considering<00:05:15.909> the<00:05:16.060> limitations<00:05:16.659> with<00:05:16.779> Android

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:17.229 
considering the limitations with Android

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:19.800 
considering the limitations with Android
L<00:05:17.469> and<00:05:17.710> with<00:05:18.189> Windows<00:05:18.550> 7<00:05:18.849> as<00:05:19.240> I've<00:05:19.629> mentioned

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.810 
L and with Windows 7 as I've mentioned

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:21.420 
L and with Windows 7 as I've mentioned
for<00:05:20.169> the<00:05:20.199> previous<00:05:20.589> two<00:05:20.770> apps<00:05:20.919> this<00:05:21.370> is

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
for the previous two apps this is

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.159 
for the previous two apps this is
actually<00:05:21.849> the<00:05:21.939> best<00:05:22.120> option<00:05:22.599> and<00:05:22.839> the<00:05:22.960> best

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:23.169 
actually the best option and the best

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:26.040 
actually the best option and the best
working<00:05:23.620> for<00:05:23.949> me<00:05:24.159> the<00:05:24.789> only<00:05:24.969> limitations<00:05:25.750> is

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
working for me the only limitations is

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.329 
working for me the only limitations is
that<00:05:26.770> I<00:05:26.979> guess<00:05:27.370> is<00:05:27.639> not<00:05:27.819> designed<00:05:28.180> for<00:05:28.360> this<00:05:28.509> so

00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:29.339 
that I guess is not designed for this so

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:31.469 
that I guess is not designed for this so
you<00:05:30.339> know<00:05:30.460> you<00:05:30.520> might<00:05:30.759> have<00:05:30.789> problems<00:05:31.120> with

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:31.479 
you know you might have problems with

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:33.209 
you know you might have problems with
Tsang<00:05:31.750> resolution<00:05:32.439> and<00:05:32.589> stuff<00:05:32.830> like<00:05:32.979> that

00:05:33.209 --> 00:05:33.219 
Tsang resolution and stuff like that

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:36.179 
Tsang resolution and stuff like that
just<00:05:33.789> I<00:05:33.939> guess<00:05:34.240> minor<00:05:34.599> problems<00:05:35.139> or<00:05:35.649> still

00:05:36.179 --> 00:05:36.189 
just I guess minor problems or still

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:38.129 
just I guess minor problems or still
stuff<00:05:36.669> you<00:05:36.759> didn't<00:05:37.000> know<00:05:37.180> it<00:05:37.330> and<00:05:37.569> stuff<00:05:37.839> is

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:38.139 
stuff you didn't know it and stuff is

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:41.519 
stuff you didn't know it and stuff is
doing<00:05:38.439> to<00:05:38.680> impede<00:05:39.069> on<00:05:39.370> your<00:05:40.240> experience<00:05:40.960> also

00:05:41.519 --> 00:05:41.529 
doing to impede on your experience also

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:43.740 
doing to impede on your experience also
you<00:05:42.279> do<00:05:42.460> actually<00:05:42.639> seem<00:05:43.029> to<00:05:43.060> get<00:05:43.270> quite<00:05:43.569> a<00:05:43.599> bit

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.750 
you do actually seem to get quite a bit

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.139 
you do actually seem to get quite a bit
for<00:05:43.870> lag<00:05:44.139> more<00:05:44.860> so<00:05:45.159> than<00:05:45.490> what<00:05:45.639> I<00:05:45.669> noticed<00:05:46.000> when

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:46.149 
for lag more so than what I noticed when

00:05:46.149 --> 00:05:48.480 
for lag more so than what I noticed when
I<00:05:46.360> display<00:05:46.779> on<00:05:46.990> my<00:05:47.020> phone<00:05:47.529> now<00:05:47.889> I<00:05:47.919> do<00:05:48.159> have<00:05:48.430> a

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.490 
I display on my phone now I do have a

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:50.279 
I display on my phone now I do have a
terrible<00:05:49.000> internet<00:05:49.360> connection<00:05:49.810> I<00:05:49.870> only<00:05:50.080> get

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:50.289 
terrible internet connection I only get

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:53.040 
terrible internet connection I only get
about<00:05:50.379> 2<00:05:50.740> megabytes<00:05:51.219> down<00:05:51.550> and<00:05:51.849> about<00:05:52.330> 0.2

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.050 
about 2 megabytes down and about 0.2

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.639 
about 2 megabytes down and about 0.2

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:53.649 
megabytes

00:05:53.649 --> 00:05:56.249 
megabytes
up<00:05:53.770> but<00:05:54.509> theoretically<00:05:55.509> that<00:05:55.779> shouldn't<00:05:56.169> be<00:05:56.229> a

00:05:56.249 --> 00:05:56.259 
up but theoretically that shouldn't be a

00:05:56.259 --> 00:05:58.079 
up but theoretically that shouldn't be a
problem<00:05:56.529> because<00:05:57.039> this<00:05:57.339> thing<00:05:57.639> is<00:05:57.669> only

00:05:58.079 --> 00:05:58.089 
problem because this thing is only

00:05:58.089 --> 00:06:00.719 
problem because this thing is only
communicating<00:05:59.050> locally<00:05:59.620> on<00:05:59.830> the<00:06:00.009> network<00:06:00.399> and

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:00.729 
communicating locally on the network and

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:02.969 
communicating locally on the network and
also<00:06:00.879> the<00:06:01.089> last<00:06:01.240> limitation<00:06:01.960> is<00:06:02.199> that<00:06:02.229> this

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:02.979 
also the last limitation is that this

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:05.279 
also the last limitation is that this
does<00:06:03.279> take<00:06:03.580> up<00:06:03.819> a<00:06:03.969> graphics<00:06:04.360> amp<00:06:04.599> report<00:06:05.110> on

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:05.289 
does take up a graphics amp report on

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:08.700 
does take up a graphics amp report on
your<00:06:06.219> computer<00:06:07.180> and<00:06:07.240> also<00:06:07.659> does<00:06:07.930> cross<00:06:08.289> to<00:06:08.560> get

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:08.710 
your computer and also does cross to get

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.290 
your computer and also does cross to get
an<00:06:08.860> adapter<00:06:09.310> or<00:06:09.370> something<00:06:09.729> that<00:06:09.849> works<00:06:10.060> and

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:10.300 
an adapter or something that works and

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.329 
an adapter or something that works and
like<00:06:10.810> I<00:06:10.839> said<00:06:11.169> I<00:06:11.199> don't<00:06:11.529> know<00:06:11.680> what<00:06:11.889> will<00:06:12.159> work

00:06:12.329 --> 00:06:12.339 
like I said I don't know what will work

00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:14.760 
like I said I don't know what will work
what<00:06:12.580> won't<00:06:12.789> work<00:06:13.000> I'll<00:06:13.300> try<00:06:14.110> and<00:06:14.289> leave<00:06:14.439> link

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:14.770 
what won't work I'll try and leave link

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:17.279 
what won't work I'll try and leave link
down<00:06:14.979> below<00:06:15.129> the<00:06:15.339> adapter<00:06:15.789> that<00:06:15.819> I<00:06:16.029> used<00:06:16.389> but

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:17.289 
down below the adapter that I used but

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:19.860 
down below the adapter that I used but
it's<00:06:17.949> probably<00:06:18.250> just<00:06:18.430> potluck<00:06:18.879> to<00:06:19.389> be<00:06:19.479> able<00:06:19.539> to

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:19.870 
it's probably just potluck to be able to

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:22.709 
it's probably just potluck to be able to
try<00:06:20.110> and<00:06:20.139> find<00:06:20.710> if<00:06:21.159> your<00:06:21.610> adapter<00:06:22.089> your<00:06:22.210> cable

00:06:22.709 --> 00:06:22.719 
try and find if your adapter your cable

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:24.839 
try and find if your adapter your cable
to<00:06:22.839> work<00:06:23.020> for<00:06:23.349> this<00:06:23.439> sort<00:06:24.069> of<00:06:24.159> trick<00:06:24.490> I<00:06:24.520> guess

00:06:24.839 --> 00:06:24.849 
to work for this sort of trick I guess

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:26.760 
to work for this sort of trick I guess
but<00:06:25.180> other<00:06:25.569> than<00:06:25.779> that

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:26.770 
but other than that

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:28.710 
but other than that
they're<00:06:26.919> the<00:06:27.099> three<00:06:27.430> solutions<00:06:28.030> that<00:06:28.210> I<00:06:28.240> found

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:28.720 
they're the three solutions that I found

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.040 
they're the three solutions that I found
using<00:06:29.229> your<00:06:29.349> tablet<00:06:29.860> as<00:06:29.949> a<00:06:29.979> secondary<00:06:30.490> monitor

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.050 
using your tablet as a secondary monitor

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:33.839 
using your tablet as a secondary monitor
trust<00:06:32.050> me<00:06:32.229> this<00:06:32.470> will<00:06:32.710> bring<00:06:33.009> no<00:06:33.400> end<00:06:33.699> of

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:33.849 
trust me this will bring no end of

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:35.730 
trust me this will bring no end of
benefits<00:06:34.360> if<00:06:34.539> it's<00:06:34.780> unlike<00:06:35.139> too<00:06:35.349> much<00:06:35.590> and

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:35.740 
benefits if it's unlike too much and

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:37.290 
benefits if it's unlike too much and
especially<00:06:36.190> if<00:06:36.250> you've<00:06:36.400> got<00:06:36.610> like<00:06:36.729> a<00:06:36.789> 10-inch

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:37.300 
especially if you've got like a 10-inch

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.809 
especially if you've got like a 10-inch
Roquemore<00:06:37.750> tablet<00:06:38.229> it's<00:06:38.680> going<00:06:38.949> to<00:06:39.009> be<00:06:39.099> nearly

00:06:39.809 --> 00:06:39.819 
Roquemore tablet it's going to be nearly

00:06:39.819 --> 00:06:41.909 
Roquemore tablet it's going to be nearly
as<00:06:40.030> good<00:06:40.240> as<00:06:40.479> using<00:06:41.080> a<00:06:41.229> normal<00:06:41.650> monitor

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:41.919 
as good as using a normal monitor

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:44.279 
as good as using a normal monitor
there's<00:06:42.669> no<00:06:42.849> question<00:06:43.449> that<00:06:43.569> this<00:06:43.690> will<00:06:43.930> just

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:44.289 
there's no question that this will just

00:06:44.289 --> 00:06:45.990 
there's no question that this will just
