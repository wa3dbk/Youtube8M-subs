this<00:01:45.190> kind<00:01:45.460> of<00:01:45.520> stuff<00:01:45.790> is<00:01:46.030> not<00:01:46.210> normal<00:01:46.600> on<00:01:46.810> the

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
this kind of stuff is not normal on the

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.219 
this kind of stuff is not normal on the
servers<00:01:47.350> and<00:01:47.760> but<00:01:48.760> I'm<00:01:49.150> not<00:01:49.390> just<00:01:50.020> going<00:01:50.170> to

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
servers and but I'm not just going to

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:52.350 
servers and but I'm not just going to
add<00:01:50.350> two<00:01:50.380> chests<00:01:50.920> maybe<00:01:51.250> there<00:01:51.760> might<00:01:51.790> be<00:01:52.030> like

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
add two chests maybe there might be like

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.450 
add two chests maybe there might be like
special<00:01:52.930> donation<00:01:53.290> rank<00:01:53.770> where<00:01:54.040> you<00:01:54.130> can<00:01:54.340> have

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
special donation rank where you can have

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.760 
special donation rank where you can have
for<00:01:54.700> chess<00:01:54.970> but<00:01:55.180> no<00:01:55.479> more<00:01:55.690> because<00:01:56.409> it<00:01:56.530> would

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
for chess but no more because it would

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.039 
for chess but no more because it would
get<00:01:56.979> done<00:01:57.159> fair<00:01:57.460> and<00:01:57.670> it's<00:01:57.970> no<00:01:58.180> fun<00:01:58.479> like<00:01:58.810> that

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
get done fair and it's no fun like that

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.039 
get done fair and it's no fun like that
because<00:01:59.650> you<00:02:00.150> basically<00:02:01.150> have<00:02:01.600> your<00:02:01.810> base
