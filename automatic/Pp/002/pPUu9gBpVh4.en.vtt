00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.849
 could be is to revive the idea of ​​a

 halo movie to be announced 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:33.140
 within the next few years although the 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:34.820
 main idea is to introduce halo 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.250
 to people who have never played 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.170
 some of your microsoft deliveries 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.729
 consider this series the next step 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.440
 for the franchise as entertainment 

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:44.690
 that could eventually reach the

 about 15 minutes each

 telling a story of boss master

 which narrate how he inspired 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.940
 a young cadet who will eventually 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.820
 would become a leader on board the 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.710
 nfc infinite and the introduction of the new 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.049
 character would join with the argument of 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.670
 halo 4 while providing a flashback 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:06.979
 at the beginning of the war between 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.780
 humans and the covenant the series does not 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.520
 will focus on hardcore halo fans 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.649
 resulting in a story 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.770
 about origins that will teach a lot about 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:14.659
 the 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.299
 the different facets of the universe of 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:19.100
 halo forward everything will still be available 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.829
 exclusively in the channel the machine- 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.179
 my halo waypoint for xbox was mentioned 

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:25.280
 that this project would be the greatest 

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:27.920
 investment that Microsoft would have made in 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.929
 an invasion this is all the information 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.850
 relevant available but it is known that 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:35.149
 will reveal even more in the comic-con de san 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.189
 diego this July 2012 on the other hand 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:39.229
 the report revealed screenshoots of the 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:42.079
 assault rifle structures rifle 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:44.810
 battle of m &amp; r sniper and a new 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:46.579
 weapon called wake on and I'll read the 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.429
 description of this to give a 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:53.329
 idea of ​​what carbine designation is about 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:56.329
 920 without rich manufacturer action security 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:58.459
 the air 920 plea is not an accelerator 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:00.409
 linear of compact channels that triggers 

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:02.420
 a highly explosive round to a 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.909
 incredible speed of delivering strength 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.789
 kinetics as explosive to hard targets 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.979
 as soft some will think that it is 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:11.629
 as a kind of spartan laser but to 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.280
 me at least the description gives me 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:15.680
 understand that it could be based on 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.160
 gas technology like the one they use 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.110
 the cannons frame the gaos turrets 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.870
 war 2 what do they basically do is 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.790
 throw stuff at high speeds but 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.740
 well I'm not sure before 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.080
 will reveal this game informer published a 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.970
 video interviewing 343 workers 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.680
 industries and at times it 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.660
 you can appreciate the assault rifle like 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.030
 the machine the rifle has a look 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.580
 classic somewhat improved and the machine looks 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.650
 something strange seem to be in a kind 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.900
 of ship or base floating on some 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.910
 gas planet have also been revealed 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.610
 The following details will not be 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.400
 Dedicated servers in halo 4 will have 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.860
 female models of spartans will not have 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.410
 bots in multiplayer and force mode 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.990
 is also confirmed frank o'connor 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.670
 from your account is 5 in neogaf has given 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.130
 understand that the rank system does not 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.170
 will be like halo 3 because of the fact that 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.180
 there were many busters so maybe you can 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.450
 retain the ugly credit system of 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.590
 reach or probably improve it a little 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.270
 well that's all I managed to get 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.400
 I hope you liked the video
