it<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.080> leak<00:00:25.260> right<00:00:25.439> now<00:00:25.590> just<00:00:25.830> because<00:00:26.220> it<00:00:26.400> is<00:00:26.519> a

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
it a leak right now just because it is a

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.279 
it a leak right now just because it is a
leak<00:00:26.820> build<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.570> we<00:00:27.689> don't<00:00:27.840> know<00:00:28.019> if<00:00:28.170> it's

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
leak build and we don't know if it's

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.259 
leak build and we don't know if it's
official<00:00:28.710> yet<00:00:28.920> my<00:00:29.369> guess<00:00:29.609> is<00:00:29.820> it<00:00:29.970> might<00:00:30.000> be

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
official yet my guess is it might be

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.900 
official yet my guess is it might be
official<00:00:30.779> so<00:00:31.050> just<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.800> heads<00:00:31.980> up<00:00:32.130> there<00:00:32.430> but

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
official so just a heads up there but

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.850 
official so just a heads up there but
you<00:00:33.030> will<00:00:33.300> need<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.750> be<00:00:33.809> you<00:00:34.559> will<00:00:34.680> need<00:00:34.829> to

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
you will need to be you will need to

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.430 
you will need to be you will need to
have<00:00:35.070> clockworkmod<00:00:35.480> so<00:00:36.480> that's<00:00:37.260> a

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
have clockworkmod so that's a

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.290 
have clockworkmod so that's a
prerequisite<00:00:38.370> is<00:00:38.430> only<00:00:38.850> if<00:00:39.120> you<00:00:39.239> have

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
prerequisite is only if you have

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.330 
prerequisite is only if you have
clockwork<00:00:39.780> but<00:00:39.930> if<00:00:40.050> you're<00:00:40.230> on<00:00:40.379> stock<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.250> if

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
clockwork but if you're on stock and if

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.340 
clockwork but if you're on stock and if
clock<00:00:41.579> or<00:00:41.760> quad<00:00:41.969> they<00:00:42.420> would<00:00:42.660> still<00:00:42.899> works<00:00:43.140> if

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
clock or quad they would still works if

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.860 
clock or quad they would still works if
you're<00:00:43.800> on<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.430> rom<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:44.969> have<00:00:45.059> clockworkmod<00:00:45.360> it

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
you're on a rom and have clockworkmod it

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.810 
you're on a rom and have clockworkmod it
still<00:00:46.140> works<00:00:46.350> it's<00:00:46.829> just<00:00:47.039> you<00:00:47.250> you<00:00:47.460> do<00:00:47.610> have<00:00:47.640> a

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
still works it's just you you do have a

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.819 
still works it's just you you do have a
slightly<00:00:48.300> different<00:00:48.600> methods<00:00:48.870> so<00:00:49.289> just<00:00:49.680> make

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
slightly different methods so just make

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:53.190 
have nice stock boot animation because

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.520 
have nice stock boot animation because
it<00:05:53.430> is<00:05:53.550> it'll<00:05:53.849> be<00:05:54.030> stocky<00:05:54.360> I<00:05:54.570> 22<00:05:55.110> and<00:05:55.320> it<00:05:55.409> is

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:55.530 
it is it'll be stocky I 22 and it is

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:57.649 
it is it'll be stocky I 22 and it is
just<00:05:55.710> rooted<00:05:56.130> so<00:05:56.280> it'll<00:05:56.490> be<00:05:56.520> stocky<00:05:56.909> at<00:05:57.180> 22

00:05:57.649 --> 00:05:57.659 
just rooted so it'll be stocky at 22

00:05:57.659 --> 00:05:59.600 
just rooted so it'll be stocky at 22
rooted<00:05:58.500> so<00:05:58.650> as<00:05:58.770> you<00:05:58.860> can<00:05:58.949> see<00:05:59.099> I<00:05:59.130> guess<00:05:59.340> it<00:05:59.490> has

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
rooted so as you can see I guess it has

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:00.920 
rooted so as you can see I guess it has
an<00:05:59.759> android<00:06:00.000> boot<00:06:00.270> up<00:06:00.389> screen<00:06:00.419> probably

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:00.930 
an android boot up screen probably

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:02.779 
an android boot up screen probably
because<00:06:01.229> it<00:06:01.349> has<00:06:01.380> the<00:06:01.620> custom<00:06:01.949> kernel<00:06:02.310> but

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:02.789 
because it has the custom kernel but

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:04.310 
because it has the custom kernel but
