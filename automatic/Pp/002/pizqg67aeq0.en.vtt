00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.219
 hello to all these sharks meet again 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:14.660
 for a new video on gta in the year 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:16.850
 today we are looking for 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.269
 the secret airport of los angeles 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.519
 santos 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:22.550
 so I 'm going to show you exactly on 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:23.990
 map as it found that 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.419
 secret terminal we have to go all the way 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.800
 south of the airport and then you go 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:28.220
 on the roof and you found a 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.319
 trap 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.699
 so there you just have to go down and hop 

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:33.800
 that's it you're in there is not 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:35.930
 wayne bridge ehpad leach nothing 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.030
 to do it's just had it and do it 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.490
 and then of course you will be able to 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.140
 so visit the distributors' wake 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.160
 drinks 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.110
 I warn you there is not much 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.300
 thing to do in the room there is that 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.570
 a door at the end that opens but 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.950
 otherwise, for example, we can draw on the 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.480
 bottle of water that is the airlock is 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.520
 funny that the cool fleet of which I know 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.750
 I did not see that in gta 5 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.730
 it's pretty cool so there you see 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.680
 we were with subscribers it was 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.650
 it was nice to do this 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.909
 discovery together different stuff 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.619
 which one wonders why they created 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.780
 this one is what it can serve 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.270
 for a mission I do not know about my 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.920
 knowledge it does not work but there 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.840
 I saw that they opened the doors 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.490
 who are behind we are hot I think 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.800
 although before that was not open so 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.229
 I wonder if they will not 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:23.060
 use it for a future mission 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:24.729
 do not hesitate to let me know 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.960
 what you think of it 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.640
 and on that we will immediately go to 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.310

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.990

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.490

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.680

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.750

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.670

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.540
 really it's something that does not 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.150
