now<00:02:40.470> what<00:02:40.800> you<00:02:40.830> should<00:02:41.220> do<00:02:41.430> is<00:02:41.610> you<00:02:41.640> should

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
now what you should do is you should

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.700 
now what you should do is you should
allow<00:02:42.090> them<00:02:42.270> to<00:02:42.390> go<00:02:42.510> into<00:02:42.660> vagy<00:02:42.900> rihanna<00:02:43.320> and

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
then affect wheeler the Vajrayana

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.840 
then affect wheeler the Vajrayana
because<00:02:46.230> now<00:02:46.440> not<00:02:46.770> only<00:02:46.920> have<00:02:47.100> they<00:02:47.130> used<00:02:47.670> one

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
because now not only have they used one

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.630 
because now not only have they used one
of<00:02:47.880> their<00:02:48.030> phone<00:02:48.180> support<00:02:48.570> and<00:02:48.660> monsters<00:02:49.640> they

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.660 
also can't respond with an a curse
attacks<00:02:52.230> so<00:02:52.530> that's<00:02:52.740> a<00:02:52.830> good<00:02:52.950> way<00:02:53.070> to<00:02:53.100> use<00:02:53.190> it<00:02:53.490> I

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
attacks so that's a good way to use it I

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.520 
attacks so that's a good way to use it I
would<00:02:54.120> use<00:02:54.300> it<00:02:54.450> on<00:02:54.570> a<00:02:54.600> Legionnaire<00:02:55.200> because

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
would use it on a Legionnaire because

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.610 
would use it on a Legionnaire because
the<00:02:55.620> Legionnaire<00:02:56.120> resembles<00:02:57.170> some<00:02:58.170> pretty

vs<00:03:33.560> effect<00:03:34.560> veiler<00:03:34.680> how<00:03:35.040> does<00:03:35.190> it<00:03:35.280> work<00:03:35.430> well

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
vs effect veiler how does it work well

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.900 
vs effect veiler how does it work well
we<00:03:36.750> got<00:03:36.930> understand<00:03:37.380> is<00:03:37.530> where<00:03:37.770> an<00:03:37.950> effect<00:03:38.760> is

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
we got understand is where an effect is

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:44.300 
we got understand is where an effect is
activated<00:03:39.300> is<00:03:40.400> also<00:03:41.400> where<00:03:41.610> a<00:03:41.640> results<00:03:42.860> so<00:03:43.860> the

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
activated is also where a results so the

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.760 
activated is also where a results so the
activation<00:03:45.030> of<00:03:45.150> Stardust<00:03:45.540> Dragon<00:03:45.900> happens<00:03:46.590> on

activation of Stardust Dragon happens on

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.910 
activation of Stardust Dragon happens on
the<00:03:46.920> field<00:03:47.160> so<00:03:47.730> it<00:03:47.850> can<00:03:48.060> be<00:03:48.239> negated<00:03:48.739> but<00:03:49.739> the

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
the field so it can be negated but the

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.979 
the field so it can be negated but the
cost<00:03:50.160> can<00:03:50.400> still<00:03:50.670> be<00:03:50.790> paid<00:03:51.060> even<00:03:51.600> when<00:03:51.900> the

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
cost can still be paid even when the

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:53.870 
cost can still be paid even when the

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
effects negated now let me put this into

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.610 
effects negated now let me put this into
easier<00:03:54.510> terms<00:03:54.690> to<00:03:54.959> understand<00:03:55.350> because<00:03:55.440> I

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
easier terms to understand because I

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.550 
easier terms to understand because I
know<00:03:55.709> it's<00:03:55.860> really<00:03:56.040> confusing<00:03:56.310> I<00:03:57.200> can<00:03:58.200> effect

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
know it's really confusing I can effect

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.810 
know it's really confusing I can effect

that Stardust and whenever they go to
summon<00:04:07.470> a<00:04:07.760> another<00:04:08.760> monster<00:04:09.239> they<00:04:09.959> can<00:04:10.170> still

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
summon a another monster they can still

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.770 
summon a another monster they can still
tribute<00:04:11.430> and<00:04:11.610> attempt<00:04:12.060> in<00:04:12.150> the<00:04:12.270> gate<00:04:12.450> which

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
tribute and attempt in the gate which

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.440 
tribute and attempt in the gate which
would<00:04:12.930> send<00:04:13.110> it<00:04:13.200> to<00:04:13.290> the<00:04:13.380> graveyard<00:04:14.360> but<00:04:15.360> the

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
would send it to the graveyard but the

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.060 
would send it to the graveyard but the
effect<00:04:15.720> wouldn't<00:04:16.049> activate<00:04:16.380> because<00:04:16.799> it<00:04:16.950> was

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
effect wouldn't activate because it was

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.300 
effect wouldn't activate because it was
under<00:04:17.489> the<00:04:17.609> veil<00:04:17.730> of<00:04:17.790> Effect<00:04:18.209> Veiler<00:04:19.190> so<00:04:20.190> the

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
under the veil of Effect Veiler so the

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.159 
under the veil of Effect Veiler so the
monster<00:04:20.700> are<00:04:21.000> sure<00:04:21.299> the<00:04:21.450> Stardust<00:04:21.840> Dragon

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
monster are sure the Stardust Dragon

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:23.779 
monster are sure the Stardust Dragon
since<00:04:22.380> it<00:04:22.500> didn't<00:04:22.740> successfully<00:04:23.460> in<00:04:23.520> the<00:04:23.580> gate

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:23.789 
since it didn't successfully in the gate

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:26.070 
since it didn't successfully in the gate
would<00:04:24.150> still<00:04:24.750> be<00:04:24.900> in<00:04:24.990> the<00:04:25.080> graveyard

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
would still be in the graveyard

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.589 
would still be in the graveyard
and<00:04:26.169> wouldn't<00:04:26.500> be<00:04:26.650> able<00:04:26.740> to<00:04:26.919> come<00:04:27.039> back<00:04:27.599> now

00:04:28.589 --> 00:04:28.599 
and wouldn't be able to come back now

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:30.240 
and wouldn't be able to come back now
that<00:04:28.629> could<00:04:28.900> be<00:04:28.990> confusing<00:04:29.169> because<00:04:29.770> Effect

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
that could be confusing because Effect

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.670 
that could be confusing because Effect
Veiler<00:04:30.310> does<00:04:31.150> not<00:04:31.360> stop<00:04:31.659> cards<00:04:31.990> like<00:04:32.139> sang<00:04:32.439> in

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
Veiler does not stop cards like sang in

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.219 
Veiler does not stop cards like sang in
and<00:04:33.120> other<00:04:34.120> cards<00:04:34.509> like<00:04:34.629> that<00:04:34.810> so<00:04:34.990> you<00:04:35.050> could

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:35.229 
and other cards like that so you could

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:37.559 
and other cards like that so you could
effect<00:04:35.530> veiler<00:04:35.650> assange<00:04:36.099> in<00:04:36.310> and<00:04:36.490> then<00:04:37.120> you

00:04:37.559 --> 00:04:37.569 
effect veiler assange in and then you

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:40.499 
effect veiler assange in and then you
know<00:04:37.659> have<00:04:38.500> it<00:04:38.650> get<00:04:38.800> destroyed<00:04:38.919> and<00:04:39.520> the<00:04:40.330> sang

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:40.509 
know have it get destroyed and the sang

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:42.140 
know have it get destroyed and the sang
it<00:04:40.629> would<00:04:40.750> still<00:04:40.900> get<00:04:40.990> is<00:04:41.110> affect<00:04:41.439> the

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
it would still get is affect the

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.429 
it would still get is affect the
effective<00:04:43.150> a<00:04:43.180> l'heure<00:04:43.300> does<00:04:43.449> not<00:04:43.629> follow<00:04:44.169> to

00:04:44.429 --> 00:04:44.439 
effective a l'heure does not follow to

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:46.950 
effective a l'heure does not follow to
the<00:04:44.650> graveyard<00:04:45.099> it<00:04:45.969> only<00:04:46.120> stops<00:04:46.389> on<00:04:46.629> the<00:04:46.719> field

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
the graveyard it only stops on the field

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.390 
the graveyard it only stops on the field
so<00:04:48.300> well<00:04:49.300> it<00:04:49.449> looks<00:04:49.689> like<00:04:49.800> Sardis<00:04:50.800> activates

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
so well it looks like Sardis activates

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.770 
so well it looks like Sardis activates
in<00:04:51.550> the<00:04:51.639> graveyard<00:04:51.849> it<00:04:52.180> actually<00:04:52.599> activates

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
in the graveyard it actually activates

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.890 
in the graveyard it actually activates
on<00:04:53.289> the<00:04:53.530> field<00:04:53.800> so<00:04:54.789> just<00:04:55.300> keep<00:04:55.419> that<00:04:55.479> in<00:04:55.629> mind

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
on the field so just keep that in mind

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.830 
on the field so just keep that in mind
Stardust<00:04:56.770> Dragon<00:04:56.800> so<00:04:57.789> fact<00:04:58.030> does<00:04:58.240> activate<00:04:58.719> on

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
Stardust Dragon so fact does activate on

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.290 
Stardust Dragon so fact does activate on
the<00:04:58.930> field<00:04:59.169> and<00:05:00.009> it<00:05:00.159> can<00:05:00.340> be<00:05:00.370> negated<00:05:00.759> by

hard to really understand it it's this

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:09.869 
hard to really understand it it's this
is<00:05:08.650> why<00:05:08.770> I<00:05:08.800> say<00:05:08.889> the<00:05:09.129> game's<00:05:09.310> not<00:05:09.490> really<00:05:09.729> for

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:11.219 
is why I say the game's not really for
kids<00:05:10.090> there's<00:05:10.360> some<00:05:10.539> rulings<00:05:10.810> they're<00:05:11.020> just

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:13.419 
their plays so i don't think it does too

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:14.969 
their plays so i don't think it does too
much<00:06:13.569> against<00:06:13.990> them<00:06:14.169> that<00:06:14.409> you<00:06:14.560> can<00:06:14.650> hit<00:06:14.830> it

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:14.979

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:17.800 
use it on there Stratos which is a great

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.219 
use it on there Stratos which is a great
play<00:06:18.069> because<00:06:18.550> shadows<00:06:18.940> can<00:06:19.120> really<00:06:19.389> speed<00:06:20.199> up

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:20.229
