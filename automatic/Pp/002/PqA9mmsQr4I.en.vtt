important to do that and backs will be

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.049 
important to do that and backs will be
lazy<00:00:39.840> or<00:00:40.170> it'll<00:00:40.860> come<00:00:41.100> natural<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.730> them<00:00:41.850> to

just step with the wrong foot or the
incorrect<00:00:44.730> foot<00:00:45.079> when<00:00:46.079> you<00:00:46.200> do<00:00:46.410> that<00:00:46.620> you've

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
incorrect foot when you do that you've

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:47.810 
incorrect foot when you do that you've
got<00:00:47.070> that<00:00:47.250> foot

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
got that foot

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.760 
got that foot
if<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:48.210> step<00:00:48.450> with<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.719> incorrect<00:00:49.079> incorrect

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
if you step with the incorrect incorrect

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.410 
if you step with the incorrect incorrect
foot<00:00:50.100> rather<00:00:50.280> you've<00:00:50.460> got<00:00:50.640> your<00:00:50.789> wrong<00:00:51.030> foot

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
foot rather you've got your wrong foot

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.110 
foot rather you've got your wrong foot
up<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.440> you've<00:00:52.949> got<00:00:53.129> your<00:00:53.250> quarterbacks<00:00:53.820> leg

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
up and you've got your quarterbacks leg

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.639 
up and you've got your quarterbacks leg
in<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.390> same<00:00:54.629> area<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.079> it<00:00:55.140> creates<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.500> real

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
in the same area and it creates a real

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.830 
in the same area and it creates a real
difficult<00:00:56.100> mesh<00:00:56.399> so<00:00:57.120> in<00:00:57.300> order<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.539> create<00:00:57.780> a

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
difficult mesh so in order to create a

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.889 
difficult mesh so in order to create a
more<00:00:58.020> natural<00:00:58.050> mesh<00:00:58.739> is<00:00:59.329> that<00:01:00.329> when<00:01:00.510> we're<00:01:00.809> on

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
more natural mesh is that when we're on

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.180 
more natural mesh is that when we're on
the<00:01:00.989> inside<00:01:01.109> veer<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.739> right<00:01:01.800> we're<00:01:02.160> going

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
the inside veer to the right we're going

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.290 
the inside veer to the right we're going
to<00:01:02.340> step<00:01:02.609> on<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.789> right<00:01:02.969> foot

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
to step on the right foot

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.880 
to step on the right foot
so<00:01:03.629> does<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:03.870> pitch<00:01:04.110> back<00:01:04.379> he's<00:01:04.650> going<00:01:04.799> to

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
so does that pitch back he's going to

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.830 
so does that pitch back he's going to
step<00:01:05.129> with<00:01:05.250> his<00:01:05.430> right<00:01:05.610> foot<00:01:05.640> so<00:01:06.450> he's<00:01:06.600> pushing

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
step with his right foot so he's pushing

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.330 
step with his right foot so he's pushing
with<00:01:07.110> his<00:01:07.140> left<00:01:07.470> he's<00:01:07.650> driving<00:01:08.100> with<00:01:08.159> his

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
with his left he's driving with his

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.280 
with his left he's driving with his
right<00:01:08.580> he's<00:01:09.180> pushing<00:01:09.600> with<00:01:09.720> his<00:01:09.750> left<00:01:10.080> he's

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
right he's pushing with his left he's

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.960 
right he's pushing with his left he's
driving<00:01:10.650> with<00:01:10.710> his<00:01:10.860> right<00:01:11.070> he's<00:01:11.460> pushing<00:01:11.850> with

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
driving with his right he's pushing with

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.340 
driving with his right he's pushing with
his<00:01:12.030> left<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.479> he's<00:01:12.600> driving<00:01:12.930> with<00:01:12.990> his<00:01:13.140> right

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
his left and he's driving with his right

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.469 
his left and he's driving with his right
so<00:01:13.920> we<00:01:14.040> can<00:01:14.070> have<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.340> common<00:01:14.760> terminology<00:01:15.390> in

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
so we can have a common terminology in

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.600 
so we can have a common terminology in
our<00:01:15.570> backfield<00:01:16.140> his<00:01:16.740> sprint<00:01:17.100> spot<00:01:17.340> with<00:01:17.549> the

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
our backfield his sprint spot with the

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.070 
our backfield his sprint spot with the
