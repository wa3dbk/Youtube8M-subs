00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
a very good value from any all-round

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:45.920 
a very good value from any all-round
cricket<00:00:44.910> shoe<00:00:45.090> that<00:00:45.210> they<00:00:45.360> could<00:00:45.539> use<00:00:45.719> whether

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
cricket shoe that they could use whether

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.660 
cricket shoe that they could use whether
they<00:00:46.079> were<00:00:46.140> batting<00:00:46.590> whether<00:00:47.160> either<00:00:47.370> of<00:00:47.520> them

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
they were batting whether either of them

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.279 
they were batting whether either of them
was<00:00:47.820> sending<00:00:48.149> down<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.329> few<00:00:48.629> of<00:00:48.750> their<00:00:48.899> office

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
was sending down a few of their office

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.110 
was sending down a few of their office
or<00:00:49.530> whether<00:00:49.920> they<00:00:50.129> were<00:00:50.250> spending<00:00:50.670> long<00:00:50.850> days

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
or whether they were spending long days

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.139 
or whether they were spending long days
in<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.480> field<00:00:51.780> so<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.710> hours<00:00:52.890> at<00:00:53.160> FS<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.760> shoe

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
in the field so the hours at FS to shoe

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.670 
in the field so the hours at FS to shoe
certainly<00:00:54.660> comes<00:00:54.870> from<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.140> pretty<00:00:55.320> good

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
certainly comes from a pretty good

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.459 
certainly comes from a pretty good
pedigree<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:57.120> still<00:00:57.510> is<00:00:57.719> an<00:00:57.840> exceptionally

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
pedigree and still is an exceptionally

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.680 
pedigree and still is an exceptionally
good<00:00:58.500> value<00:00:58.949> for<00:00:58.980> money<00:00:59.160> option<00:00:59.699> like<00:01:00.329> I<00:01:00.359> said

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
good value for money option like I said

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.029 
good value for money option like I said
it's<00:01:00.870> similar<00:01:01.109> in<00:01:01.289> terms<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.829> grain

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
it's similar in terms of the grain

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.520 
it's similar in terms of the grain
equals<00:01:02.309> velocity<00:01:02.629> in<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:03.809> value<00:01:04.229> for<00:01:04.379> money

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
equals velocity in that value for money

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.310 
equals velocity in that value for money
band<00:01:05.210> and<00:01:06.210> something<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:06.900> we're<00:01:06.990> pleased<00:01:07.229> to

have new into stock here the updated

have new into stock here the updated
version<00:01:10.170> obviously<00:01:10.680> because<00:01:10.830> it's<00:01:10.920> got<00:01:11.040> this

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
version obviously because it's got this

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.920 
version obviously because it's got this
soda<00:01:11.490> red<00:01:11.790> color<00:01:12.119> scheme<00:01:12.420> which<00:01:12.600> you<00:01:12.720> don't

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
soda red color scheme which you don't

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.530 
soda red color scheme which you don't
often<00:01:13.380> see<00:01:13.740> or<00:01:14.670> certainly<00:01:14.970> last<00:01:15.210> year's<00:01:15.450> was

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
often see or certainly last year's was

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.020 
often see or certainly last year's was
the<00:01:15.659> blue<00:01:15.840> scheme<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.740> I've<00:01:16.860> got<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.159> SL<00:01:17.610> 22

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
the blue scheme and I've got the SL 22

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.429 
the blue scheme and I've got the SL 22
through<00:01:18.299> in<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.600> blue<00:01:18.750> scheme<00:01:19.049> at<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.259> red<00:01:19.409> I

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
through in the blue scheme at the red I

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.710 
through in the blue scheme at the red I
really<00:01:19.890> like<00:01:20.070> it's<00:01:20.759> not<00:01:20.939> for<00:01:21.180> everyone<00:01:21.540> it's<00:01:21.659> a

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
really like it's not for everyone it's a

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.510 
really like it's not for everyone it's a
bit<00:01:21.900> garish<00:01:22.170> but<00:01:22.860> this<00:01:22.979> has<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.159> little<00:01:23.310> bit

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
bit garish but this has a little bit

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.130 
bit garish but this has a little bit
less<00:01:23.700> it<00:01:23.880> doesn't<00:01:23.939> have<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.330> whole<00:01:24.540> back<00:01:24.840> heel

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
less it doesn't have the whole back heel

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.510 
less it doesn't have the whole back heel
like<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.530> vectors<00:01:25.860> or<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.100> vector<00:01:26.369> means

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
like the vectors or the vector means

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.819 
like the vectors or the vector means
covered<00:01:27.330> in<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.509> red<00:01:27.720> so<00:01:28.110> it's<00:01:28.229> not<00:01:28.350> quite<00:01:28.650> as

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
covered in the red so it's not quite as

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.859 
covered in the red so it's not quite as
bad<00:01:28.979> now<00:01:29.700> as<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:29.850> said<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.090> isn't<00:01:30.329> all<00:01:30.420> round<00:01:30.689> of

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
bad now as I said it isn't all round of

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.569 
bad now as I said it isn't all round of
shoot<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.950> therefore<00:01:32.189> it's<00:01:32.280> got<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.430> few

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
shoot and therefore it's got a few

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:33.950 
shoot and therefore it's got a few
features<00:01:33.000> that<00:01:33.030> are<00:01:33.270> helping<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.689> kind<00:01:33.900> of

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
very much like the grain it caused all

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.980 
very much like the grain it caused all
around<00:02:17.880> the<00:02:18.000> shoes<00:02:18.180> tend<00:02:18.450> to<00:02:18.540> look<00:02:18.660> for<00:02:18.870> more

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
around the shoes tend to look for more

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.720 
around the shoes tend to look for more
support<00:02:19.290> in<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:19.560> midsole<00:02:20.040> rather<00:02:20.430> than

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
support in the midsole rather than

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.910 
support in the midsole rather than
towards<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.480> heel<00:02:21.690> or<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.350> ankle<00:02:22.770> like

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
towards the heel or the ankle like

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.650 
towards the heel or the ankle like
bowling<00:02:23.160> shoes<00:02:23.610> so<00:02:23.880> if<00:02:24.030> you're<00:02:24.150> someone<00:02:24.480> who's

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
bowling shoes so if you're someone who's

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.320 
bowling shoes so if you're someone who's
aware<00:02:25.230> of<00:02:25.290> their<00:02:26.070> ankle<00:02:26.490> issues<00:02:26.850> I'd<00:02:27.030> go<00:02:27.180> with

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
aware of their ankle issues I'd go with

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.360 
aware of their ankle issues I'd go with
a<00:02:27.360> higher<00:02:27.600> cut<00:02:27.960> shoe<00:02:28.260> but<00:02:28.770> if<00:02:28.860> you<00:02:28.950> are<00:02:29.070> someone

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
a higher cut shoe but if you are someone

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.460 
a higher cut shoe but if you are someone
who<00:02:29.400> does<00:02:29.490> foot<00:02:29.940> tends<00:02:30.240> to<00:02:30.390> sort<00:02:30.510> of<00:02:30.600> roll<00:02:30.840> then

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
who does foot tends to sort of roll then

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.350 
who does foot tends to sort of roll then
the<00:02:31.620> midsole<00:02:32.010> is<00:02:32.280> certainly<00:02:32.700> yeah<00:02:32.940> you're

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
the midsole is certainly yeah you're

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.910 
the midsole is certainly yeah you're
looking<00:02:33.630> for<00:02:33.750> protection<00:02:33.870> and<00:02:34.590> that's

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
looking for protection and that's

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.640 
looking for protection and that's
actually<00:02:35.160> contributed<00:02:36.000> or<00:02:36.320> helped<00:02:37.320> by<00:02:37.590> the

actually contributed or helped by the

certainly<00:03:03.660> got<00:03:03.810> grip<00:03:04.140> nailed<00:03:04.380> on<00:03:04.590> and<00:03:04.830> as<00:03:04.890> you

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
certainly got grip nailed on and as you

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.010 
certainly got grip nailed on and as you
can<00:03:05.160> see<00:03:05.400> here<00:03:05.640> I'm<00:03:05.970> modeling<00:03:06.540> one<00:03:06.780> of<00:03:06.900> these

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
can see here I'm modeling one of these

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.560 
can see here I'm modeling one of these
and<00:03:07.920> they're<00:03:08.040> incredibly<00:03:08.550> comfortable<00:03:09.060> they

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
and they're incredibly comfortable they

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.570 
and they're incredibly comfortable they
are<00:03:09.600> they<00:03:10.410> do<00:03:10.470> come<00:03:10.740> up<00:03:10.830> a<00:03:10.950> little<00:03:11.250> smaller

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
are they do come up a little smaller

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.510 
are they do come up a little smaller
than<00:03:11.700> advertised<00:03:12.300> this<00:03:13.140> one<00:03:13.440> is<00:03:13.650> the<00:03:13.830> UK<00:03:14.220> size

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
than advertised this one is the UK size

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.979 
than advertised this one is the UK size
11<00:03:15.450> or<00:03:15.570> the<00:03:15.720> US<00:03:16.020> size<00:03:17.060> 11<00:03:18.060> and<00:03:18.209> a<00:03:18.239> half<00:03:18.270> says

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
11 or the US size 11 and a half says

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.150 
11 or the US size 11 and a half says
only<00:03:19.260> I<00:03:19.290> don't<00:03:19.560> if<00:03:19.680> you<00:03:19.770> can<00:03:19.800> see<00:03:20.010> that

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
only I don't if you can see that

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.949 
only I don't if you can see that
targeting<00:03:20.790> in<00:03:20.910> detail<00:03:21.300> there's<00:03:21.480> only<00:03:21.600> a<00:03:21.690> half

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
targeting in detail there's only a half

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.229 
targeting in detail there's only a half
size<00:03:22.320> difference<00:03:22.830> in<00:03:22.950> the<00:03:23.070> two<00:03:23.400> so<00:03:23.970> they<00:03:24.090> are<00:03:24.150> a

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
size difference in the two so they are a

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.050 
size difference in the two so they are a
little<00:03:24.450> smaller<00:03:25.010> then<00:03:26.010> perhaps<00:03:26.370> other<00:03:26.760> shoes

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
little smaller then perhaps other shoes

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.729 
little smaller then perhaps other shoes
so<00:03:27.330> just<00:03:27.570> do<00:03:27.750> bear<00:03:28.020> that<00:03:28.200> in<00:03:28.290> mind<00:03:28.320> if<00:03:28.620> you<00:03:28.709> are

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
so just do bear that in mind if you are

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.440 
so just do bear that in mind if you are
ordering<00:03:29.040> them<00:03:29.340> online<00:03:29.489> as<00:03:29.850> you<00:03:29.940> know<00:03:30.120> we<00:03:30.239> ship

all over the world but in terms of

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.430 
all over the world but in terms of
continuing<00:03:33.000> with<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.209> shoe<00:03:33.450> it's<00:03:33.930> got<00:03:34.080> a<00:03:34.110> very

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
continuing with the shoe it's got a very

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.140 
continuing with the shoe it's got a very
very<00:03:34.560> strong<00:03:34.980> toe<00:03:35.550> this<00:03:35.760> is<00:03:35.850> one<00:03:36.000> of<00:03:36.030> the

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
very strong toe this is one of the

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.670 
very strong toe this is one of the
features<00:03:36.480> weight<00:03:36.660> is<00:03:36.840> a<00:03:36.870> better<00:03:37.170> shoe<00:03:37.470> than

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
features weight is a better shoe than

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.840 
features weight is a better shoe than
the<00:03:37.770> grain<00:03:37.920> equals<00:03:38.190> velocity<00:03:38.640> for<00:03:38.820> example

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
the grain equals velocity for example

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.300 
the grain equals velocity for example
it's<00:03:39.690> incredibly<00:03:40.290> strong<00:03:40.620> at<00:03:40.800> the<00:03:40.860> toe<00:03:41.070> so<00:03:41.130> if

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
it's incredibly strong at the toe so if

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.400 
it's incredibly strong at the toe so if
you<00:03:41.400> do<00:03:41.519> get<00:03:41.670> in<00:03:41.910> by<00:03:42.090> Yorker<00:03:42.660> or<00:03:42.870> if<00:03:43.170> you<00:03:43.260> are<00:03:43.380> a

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
you do get in by Yorker or if you are a

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:44.900 
you do get in by Yorker or if you are a
little<00:03:43.560> bit<00:03:43.769> of<00:03:43.830> a<00:03:43.890> faster<00:03:44.340> ball<00:03:44.519> you<00:03:44.760> could

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
little bit of a faster ball you could

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.479 
little bit of a faster ball you could
get<00:03:45.120> away<00:03:45.239> with<00:03:45.540> wearing<00:03:45.720> these<00:03:46.110> I<00:03:46.950> like<00:03:47.310> these

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
get away with wearing these I like these

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.040 
get away with wearing these I like these
sort<00:03:47.550> of<00:03:47.760> stuff<00:03:48.060> section<00:03:48.480> towards<00:03:48.750> the<00:03:48.840> toe

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
sort of stuff section towards the toe

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.040 
sort of stuff section towards the toe
just<00:03:49.590> extra<00:03:50.070> strong<00:03:50.370> their<00:03:50.989> materials<00:03:51.989> to

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
just extra strong their materials to

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:53.600 
just extra strong their materials to
ensure<00:03:52.320> that<00:03:52.350> if<00:03:52.560> you<00:03:52.620> do<00:03:52.830> scuff<00:03:53.190> that<00:03:53.370> foot

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
ensure that if you do scuff that foot

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.550 
ensure that if you do scuff that foot
when<00:03:53.910> you're<00:03:54.030> running<00:03:54.239> or<00:03:54.570> approaching<00:03:55.470> the

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
when you're running or approaching the

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.960 
when you're running or approaching the
crease<00:03:55.800> then<00:03:56.010> it<00:03:56.100> is<00:03:56.190> going<00:03:56.400> to<00:03:56.459> last<00:03:56.610> a<00:03:56.820> long

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
crease then it is going to last a long

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.479 
crease then it is going to last a long
time<00:03:57.030> so<00:03:57.630> overall<00:03:58.230> I<00:03:58.350> do<00:03:58.470> think<00:03:58.860> the<00:03:59.040> attention

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
time so overall I do think the attention

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:00.710 
time so overall I do think the attention
to<00:03:59.550> detail<00:03:59.970> there<00:04:00.180> has<00:04:00.269> certainly<00:04:00.510> been

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
to detail there has certainly been

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.290 
to detail there has certainly been
really<00:04:01.650> taken<00:04:02.040> into<00:04:02.130> account<00:04:02.340> what<00:04:03.060> I'll<00:04:03.150> do

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
really taken into account what I'll do

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.759 
really taken into account what I'll do
now<00:04:03.450> is<00:04:03.480> I'll<00:04:03.750> stick<00:04:03.959> them<00:04:04.080> on<00:04:04.200> the<00:04:04.290> scale<00:04:04.530> so

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
now is I'll stick them on the scale so

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.440 
now is I'll stick them on the scale so
I'll<00:04:04.830> just<00:04:04.980> show<00:04:05.130> you<00:04:05.160> a<00:04:05.340> way<00:04:05.610> trot<00:04:06.000> of<00:04:06.239> them

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
I'll just show you a way trot of them

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:07.610 
I'll just show you a way trot of them
because<00:04:06.900> obviously<00:04:06.989> that's<00:04:07.260> something<00:04:07.320> that

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
because obviously that's something that

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:08.960 
because obviously that's something that
a<00:04:07.680> lot<00:04:07.830> of<00:04:07.860> people<00:04:08.190> are<00:04:08.280> very<00:04:08.310> conscious<00:04:08.880> of

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
a lot of people are very conscious of

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.300 
a lot of people are very conscious of
these<00:04:09.150> days<00:04:09.390> whereas<00:04:09.600> buying<00:04:09.810> a<00:04:09.989> shoe<00:04:10.310> there

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
these days whereas buying a shoe there

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:12.920 
these days whereas buying a shoe there
do<00:04:11.489> bear<00:04:11.790> in<00:04:11.910> mind<00:04:12.030> that's<00:04:12.180> without<00:04:12.390> the<00:04:12.660> spike

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
do bear in mind that's without the spike

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.560 
do bear in mind that's without the spike
so<00:04:13.230> they<00:04:13.350> are<00:04:13.440> 460<00:04:14.280> grams<00:04:14.310> so<00:04:15.090> they're<00:04:15.239> not<00:04:15.420> the

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
so they are 460 grams so they're not the

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.210 
so they are 460 grams so they're not the
lightest<00:04:16.080> shoe<00:04:16.350> certainly<00:04:16.739> these<00:04:16.890> are<00:04:17.010> a<00:04:17.040> size

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
lightest shoe certainly these are a size

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.820 
lightest shoe certainly these are a size
11<00:04:17.730> though<00:04:17.910> so<00:04:18.510> they're<00:04:18.660> probably<00:04:18.900> the

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
11 though so they're probably the

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:21.830 
11 though so they're probably the
lighter<00:04:20.100> end<00:04:20.460> of<00:04:20.580> average<00:04:21.000> for<00:04:21.270> a<00:04:21.330> shoe<00:04:21.570> and
