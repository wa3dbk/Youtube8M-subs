tractors<00:02:34.460> are<00:02:34.610> die<00:02:34.820> cast<00:02:35.120> aluminum<00:02:35.300> and<00:02:35.810> this

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
tractors are die cast aluminum and this

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.900 
tractors are die cast aluminum and this
is<00:02:36.440> getting<00:02:36.740> away<00:02:36.860> from<00:02:37.220> the<00:02:37.340> aluminum<00:02:37.790> I

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
is getting away from the aluminum I

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.220 
is getting away from the aluminum I
guess<00:02:38.090> the<00:02:38.270> price<00:02:38.450> of<00:02:38.660> it<00:02:38.750> is<00:02:38.810> what's<00:02:39.020> driving

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
guess the price of it is what's driving

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.080 
guess the price of it is what's driving
it<00:02:39.440> they're<00:02:39.650> going<00:02:39.860> back<00:02:40.130> to<00:02:40.160> the<00:02:40.490> press<00:02:40.760> steel

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
it they're going back to the press steel

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.440 
it they're going back to the press steel
and<00:02:42.130> which<00:02:43.130> I'm<00:02:43.430> not<00:02:43.610> real<00:02:43.790> happy<00:02:43.940> with<00:02:44.210> but

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
and which I'm not real happy with but

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.990 
and which I'm not real happy with but
that's<00:02:44.630> just<00:02:45.020> the<00:02:45.290> sign<00:02:45.860> of<00:02:46.010> the<00:02:46.100> times<00:02:46.370> to

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
that's just the sign of the times to

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.570 
that's just the sign of the times to
save<00:02:47.210> costs<00:02:47.690> so<00:02:48.320> this<00:02:48.560> rake<00:02:48.920> is<00:02:49.100> an<00:02:49.220> actual

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
save costs so this rake is an actual

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.280 
save costs so this rake is an actual
