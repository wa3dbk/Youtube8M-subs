00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:22.810 
after this level I think it's actually

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.010 
after this level I think it's actually
the<00:00:23.050> first<00:00:23.830> boss<00:00:24.180> so<00:00:25.180> I'll<00:00:25.360> do<00:00:25.570> that<00:00:25.720> and<00:00:25.930> then

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:26.020

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:27.040 
i'll probably stop recording because i

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.700 
i'll probably stop recording because i
