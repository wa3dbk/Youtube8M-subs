00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:05.860
 when I think the level is good 

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:07.460
 level is good 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.200
 specifically they are going or sports plan have been made 

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:15.089
 evaluation the first days of strength there talking to the prof 

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:19.219
 I said hello told me that the parameters were really very good and 

00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:21.710
 boné pasa is that one happens that 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.659
 that one has the possibility to verify the data 

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:26.159
 and has the possibility of 

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:27.960
 as I said next to the teacher 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.739
 evaluate them 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:31.359
 realize that the 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:34.100
 if a good physical condition one passes that can 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.640
 can work a little more quiet 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.150
 what is sought with storm 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.510
 Mary by the mind what I like that the parties are as feared as possible 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.410
 if one what you are looking for this afternoon 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.200
 two goals to sort them abc so good for me it's very important that 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.600
 percent 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.880
 that physically 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.610
 be powerful next is going to repeat 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.610
 the recordings gave well so 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.150
 that is a good measure 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.890
 we have there I entered the opponent and well also that these 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.320
 I tempt the city is something less than one out there but attack what do you think you're going 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.550
 well what are you going to direct addressed so that you can work 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.210
 the good hour 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.460
 if that the idea 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.609
 that's an idea last night as sports and counting 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.760
 I believe that I do when one explains a job, all the work has a reason why 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.470
 and the idea that the boys are also healing tells what they will do 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.440
 I work for doing it because just one out there 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.700
 tell him if this ends up being like that 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.980
 to be understood and obviously when 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.120
 here a good action that is active does not have a bad action or 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.280
 magical and lethal in mind that what is today the only way to 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.000
 of being able to grow 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.870
 how the clown emerges when you work, commented Otoniel 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.870

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.560

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.369
 percent the last year my honor in activity as a professional coa 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.630
 that was in San Lorenzo I had the possibility of 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.750
 what good of what of who was born méndez 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.490
 when I speak as a coach 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:02.820
 doctors and he did not have 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.130
 If I did not want to give 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.220
 I did not want to be part 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.470
 of the coaching staff and in the complicated situation poverty have motivated nor was 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.470

 to my companions we archer 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.420
 they purely gave the go-ahead because they chose not to ask them to take that 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.089
 want 

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:25.829

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:28.829
