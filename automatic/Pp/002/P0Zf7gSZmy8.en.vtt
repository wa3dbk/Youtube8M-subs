our<00:01:10.509> respects<00:01:10.990> to<00:01:11.369> Albion<00:01:12.369> last<00:01:12.970> hero<00:01:13.420> I<00:01:13.810> never

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320

thought I'd enter this place again you

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.230 
thought I'd enter this place again you
should<00:01:16.780> have<00:01:16.899> known<00:01:17.110> better<00:01:17.429> about<00:01:18.429> 20<00:01:18.850> or<00:01:18.970> 30

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360
