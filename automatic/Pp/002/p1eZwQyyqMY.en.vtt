00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:09.520
 the c4 in the coupe of BMW Motorsport a toy for well-heeled private 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.309
 Racers the car has no street legal until then for the 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.510
 Racing and even has its play on the steering wheel, the driver 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:21.500
 from the windscreen wiper to the brake system to the radio everything 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.009
 Control 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:26.009
 the driver does not need to take his hands off the wheel 

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:31.489
 her inner eye looks like it is from the outside like normal Zetsche 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.390
 Also food and clean are currently different 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.060
 but my authority for 1 1 off in the engine compartment 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.090
 this victory for the whole opera 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.360
 channeled out at the top 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.360
 and that's why out is also understandable on the front axle 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.820
 because that the cool air is discharged upwards, it does not happen 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.850
 Fouling on the subfloor 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.970
 the engine of the z4 is the straight-six of the old m3 after all 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.970
 Eminem copy he made 400 hp 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.350
 In a race car you have to consistently change the airflow around the car to the 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.370
 To squeeze the road 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.310
 of course it can be the roof and compartment 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.310
 and the whole thing will be complemented by 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.770
 it's not that I'm almost dead 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:19.940
 to get under pressure 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.940
 so that motorists on slippery roads 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.250
 fixed Freising 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.610
 without the target value 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.710
 the air deteriorates again 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.710
 worsen again 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.990
 So the secret of faster cars is in Madrid 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.119
 bmw factory driver 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.340
 when Claudia gets the trash mostly in the car 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.660
 Together with hans-joachim Stuck she has the copy in the 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.660
 24-hour race stopped is important 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.340
 and we can 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.080
 the honorary office is 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.360
 it is enough 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.360
 that everything works 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.860
 traffic planners 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.860
 the hospital team what he says 

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:15.189
 the steering wheel is the command center of the BMW 

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:18.229
 All important functions of the car run together here 

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:21.669
 yes the nice thing is that a car on the steering wheel so small and now in the ether 

00:02:21.669 --> 00:02:23.149
 Bodo 

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:26.579
 how much the traction control should help you and how much that first 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:30.699
 Middleton is said to have more levels and that, of course, alone 

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:32.409
 80's Constancio goes away 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:34.229
 what they cost better under control 

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:37.009
 the car can be adjusted you can adjust yourself 

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:40.009
 like you doctor almost and of course 

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:43.979
 So no one is not 

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:48.139
 it's time team boss with the car on the 20 com 8 kilometers long 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:51.139
 Nordschleife 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:55.120
 Why 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:01.250
 The car makes sounds that you normally go to the workshop immediately 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.250
 send 

00:03:05.779 --> 00:03:09.249
 No 

00:03:09.249 --> 00:03:13.529
 Wanted to brutally run water basement wanted to go 

00:03:13.529 --> 00:03:15.829
 105 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:19.750
 but the team in full swing by Tonga Kremls just beautiful I do a lot 

00:03:19.749 --> 00:03:22.749
 learned 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:36.989
 I have the club 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.789
 are 8500 revolutions 

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:43.149
 and both were denied having a simply denied by tens 

00:03:44.029 --> 00:03:47.139
 and when switching back but you have to enter neither the clutch 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:50.139
 Panoro com a party-goer traveling computer games 

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:52.919
 and back you have to enter the clutch 

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:54.229
 that's easy 

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:56.790
 Percent drive at the highest level what you just 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.790
 Fun because you do not have to be on Schalke 04 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:08.009
 that is unbelievably bitter for us 

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:09.849
 «We stopped earlier 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:12.879
 really movie also ends up speeding up this is absolutely 

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:17.469
 Obama seemed visibly relieved to give the car a hand 

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:18.430
 incredible 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.599
 what a maximum something 

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:24.479
 Percent is the author Hans Soldan because he gives eerie direct redress 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:25.800
 if the Kerpener pull 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.999
 worse than running 

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:28.650
 is enough opportunity 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.840
 you just have to join them for the union of all the total time this is one 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.840
 Problem read the insect 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:44.860
 the long winter a role 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.129
 their dynamics 

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:48.689
 makes sure that the car pressed on the street 

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:51.240
 Grevesmühlen downforce or downforce 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.729
 doing a whole point Viana Nordschleife where you really over 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:57.680
 Dome over it comes with over 200 or well over 200 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.490
 if the car then in it's appetite concerns the same bite right away 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.490
 stable 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:11.669
 who is constantly overwhelmed and a car is more difficult in paradise 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.750
 while Downforce Auto on the Nordschleife it's just the other way around 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.569
 It is much more difficult to refuse driving a car with road tires 

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:21.569
 Alzenau silly downforce around the ball 

00:05:29.809 --> 00:05:33.779
 the brake is still cold you have to kick him if his limbs are limited 

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:34.740
 firm in life 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.430
 because the train is going slowly but still so that you really quite whole 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:39.830
 firmly did it 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:44.410
 and still hear a nice feel when that just starts 

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:45.439
 to step in 

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:48.620
 and what, of course, more imaginable that palace hot dance so imagine 

00:05:48.619 --> 00:05:51.389
 how much the rear brake with brake or not 

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:54.180
 So there is relatively little as a dry burning scene 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:58.220
 and when it gets wet SMOS are more with brakes just because the car 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.690
 can not be so strong on making calls can delay the people Red 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.229
 the BMW z4 m coupe weighs only 1000 compulsion 

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:10.190
 with kilograms of the sprint to 100 km takes just four seconds each 

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:11.150
 after station 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:12.580
 pity the car safe
