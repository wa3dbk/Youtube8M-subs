00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
so that's really it but majority of the

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.789 
so that's really it but majority of the
build<00:00:12.269> is<00:00:12.480> complete<00:00:12.750> for<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.380> most<00:00:13.590> part

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
build is complete for the most part

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.470 
build is complete for the most part
cable<00:00:14.190> management<00:00:14.370> was<00:00:14.759> definitely<00:00:15.150> a<00:00:15.210> task

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
cable management was definitely a task

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.380 
cable management was definitely a task
in<00:00:15.719> itself<00:00:15.890> and<00:00:16.890> everything<00:00:17.369> like<00:00:17.490> that<00:00:17.550> but

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
in itself and everything like that but

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.189 
in itself and everything like that but
here<00:00:18.660> is<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:19.140> case<00:00:19.710> itself<00:00:20.449> is<00:00:21.449> completely

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
here is the case itself is completely

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.040 
here is the case itself is completely
done<00:00:22.500> as<00:00:22.830> you<00:00:23.220> can<00:00:23.369> tell<00:00:23.609> just<00:00:23.880> need<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.660> paint

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
done as you can tell just need to paint

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.779 
done as you can tell just need to paint
these<00:00:25.320> two<00:00:25.710> guys<00:00:25.890> right<00:00:26.220> here<00:00:26.279> with<00:00:26.670> this

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
these two guys right here with this

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.730 
these two guys right here with this
color<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.439> then<00:00:28.439> I<00:00:28.740> love<00:00:29.369> this<00:00:29.580> handle<00:00:30.740> go

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
color and then I love this handle go

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.760 
color and then I love this handle go
ahead<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.040> flip<00:00:32.279> it<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.669> you<00:00:33.030> can<00:00:33.180> see<00:00:33.420> the

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 
ahead and flip it and you can see the

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.470 
ahead and flip it and you can see the
side<00:00:34.770> panel<00:00:35.190> isn't<00:00:35.340> bulging<00:00:35.820> at<00:00:36.000> all<00:00:36.149> because

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
side panel isn't bulging at all because

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.209 
side panel isn't bulging at all because
of<00:00:37.079> this<00:00:37.920> nice<00:00:38.219> little<00:00:38.690> thing<00:00:39.690> right<00:00:39.899> here

00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:40.219 
of this nice little thing right here

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:45.889 
of this nice little thing right here
that<00:00:41.219> bulges<00:00:41.700> out<00:00:41.910> so<00:00:43.309> looks<00:00:44.309> pretty<00:00:44.610> good<00:00:45.030> for

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
that bulges out so looks pretty good for

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.639 
that bulges out so looks pretty good for
the<00:00:45.989> most<00:00:46.050> part<00:00:47.870> definitely<00:00:48.870> has<00:00:49.260> some<00:00:49.469> weight

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
the most part definitely has some weight

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.790 
the most part definitely has some weight
to<00:00:49.860> it<00:00:49.890> because<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.550> water<00:00:51.149> cooling<00:00:51.800> and

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
to it because of the water cooling and

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.979 
to it because of the water cooling and
i'm<00:00:53.760> going<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.000> show<00:00:54.180> you<00:00:54.210> what<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.570> looks<00:00:54.600> like

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
i'm going to show you what it looks like

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.779 
i'm going to show you what it looks like
now<00:00:55.050> this<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:55.530> not<00:00:55.710> really<00:00:56.340> good<00:00:56.579> for<00:00:56.730> the

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
now this is not really good for the

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.689 
now this is not really good for the
computer<00:00:57.239> but<00:00:57.420> hey<00:00:57.570> you<00:00:58.350> know<00:00:58.530> so<00:00:59.520> you<00:00:59.579> guys

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
for the hard drive activity light so it

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.210 
for the hard drive activity light so it
does<00:01:41.670> work<00:01:41.700> at<00:01:42.119> everything<00:01:42.540> so<00:01:43.439> looks<00:01:43.799> pretty
