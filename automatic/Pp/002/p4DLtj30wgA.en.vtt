 but when the agent author of a bestseller asking for the end of the world 

00:00:14.659 --> 00:00:18.030
 he states that this information came from a secret code 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.499
 hidden in a bible 

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:25.309
 I will return to show a world war the nuclear holocaust isva and the end of the 

00:00:25.309 --> 00:00:25.880
 days 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.080
 the bible says that everything will happen in 2006 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.750
 we can have less than a year to save the world there is the oal 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.500
 they will advise 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.500
 in the power 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.630
 the two have different is that maicon states that it has in common with 25 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.920
 or he protested in one of the greatest discoveries ever made 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.260
 huweini 6 million voters got it all wrong 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.120
 one of the most well-known lines of code of the Bible the call says that with 11 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.590
 the mathematical model 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.200
 São Paulo you can see a different form of lower price 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.920
 the most common and read the text in sequence starting with the first letter 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.390
 but as for the mathematician you can start wherever you want to paste one 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.270
 determined right interval of the lane so successively with intervals of 5 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.270
 What could be a fallacy is one of the tasks 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.070
 this is natural 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.720
 they intend in this test to make it easier to display 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.220
 method 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.080
 we took the first letter and every 14 we tried a divergence 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.759
 in this example we have the letters ending mp to air 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:45.360
 let's face it 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.030
 It's not very easy to be all right. 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.760
 It's been known to make it clearer, let's break my chances for each letter. 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.710
 his 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:53.799

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:13.109
 starting at the site 

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:16.109
 and hopping fifth favorite cadastre 

00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:19.109
