00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.359 
program is really amazing when you start
to<00:02:02.939> put<00:02:03.240> some<00:02:03.270> of<00:02:03.570> this<00:02:03.719> away<00:02:04.170> that<00:02:05.070> a<00:02:05.100> pretty

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
to put some of this away that a pretty

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.580 
to put some of this away that a pretty
significant<00:02:06.030> clip<00:02:06.270> for<00:02:06.840> retirement<00:02:07.140> just<00:02:07.350> as

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
significant clip for retirement just as

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.999 
significant clip for retirement just as
a<00:02:07.619> quick<00:02:07.920> way<00:02:08.129> to<00:02:08.160> illustrate<00:02:08.520> that<00:02:08.970> if<00:02:10.009> you're

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
a quick way to illustrate that if you're

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.860 
a quick way to illustrate that if you're
20<00:02:11.760> years<00:02:11.940> old

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
20 years old

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.320 
20 years old
and<00:02:13.140> you<00:02:13.530> put<00:02:13.800> just<00:02:14.450> $2,000<00:02:15.450> away<00:02:15.980> every<00:02:16.980> year

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
and you put just $2,000 away every year

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.190 
and you put just $2,000 away every year
for<00:02:18.330> six<00:02:18.599> years<00:02:19.580> so<00:02:20.580> from<00:02:20.700> age<00:02:20.910> 20<00:02:21.300> to<00:02:21.330> 26<00:02:21.930> and

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
for six years so from age 20 to 26 and

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.100 
for six years so from age 20 to 26 and
then<00:02:22.440> you<00:02:22.709> let<00:02:23.670> that<00:02:23.910> grow<00:02:24.239> at<00:02:24.720> an<00:02:24.930> average

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
then you let that grow at an average

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.440 
then you let that grow at an average
clip<00:02:25.680> of<00:02:25.860> 10%<00:02:26.550> that<00:02:26.700> is<00:02:26.940> probably<00:02:27.270> a<00:02:27.360> little

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
clip of 10% that is probably a little

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.240 
clip of 10% that is probably a little
high<00:02:27.690> these<00:02:27.750> days<00:02:27.959> but<00:02:28.319> for<00:02:28.590> illustration

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
high these days but for illustration

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.440 
high these days but for illustration
purposes<00:02:30.019> 10%<00:02:31.019> and<00:02:31.370> that<00:02:32.370> person<00:02:32.819> retires<00:02:33.150> at

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450

you feel bad because you didn't start at
20<00:03:18.030> the<00:03:18.329> point<00:03:18.630> is<00:03:18.810> start<00:03:19.650> now<00:03:19.920> the<00:03:19.950> best<00:03:20.370> time

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
20 the point is start now the best time

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.060 
20 the point is start now the best time
to<00:03:21.000> plant<00:03:21.239> a<00:03:21.390> tree<00:03:21.570> is<00:03:21.780> 25<00:03:22.260> years<00:03:22.560> ago<00:03:22.829> and<00:03:23.010> the

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
to plant a tree is 25 years ago and the

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.560 
to plant a tree is 25 years ago and the
second<00:03:23.459> best<00:03:23.609> time<00:03:23.790> to<00:03:23.940> plant<00:03:24.150> a<00:03:24.269> tree<00:03:24.390> is

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
second best time to plant a tree is

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:29.120 
second best time to plant a tree is
today<00:03:25.880> so<00:03:26.880> start<00:03:27.180> putting<00:03:27.390> away<00:03:27.630> and<00:03:28.130> you've

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
today so start putting away and you've

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.699 
today so start putting away and you've
got<00:03:29.400> the<00:03:29.640> capacity<00:03:30.480> to<00:03:30.690> do<00:03:30.810> that<00:03:30.840> you've<00:03:31.680> got

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
got the capacity to do that you've got

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.650 
got the capacity to do that you've got
the<00:03:31.950> capacity<00:03:32.430> to<00:03:32.459> do<00:03:32.609> that<00:03:32.760> so<00:03:32.940> this<00:03:33.120> is<00:03:33.299> where

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
the capacity to do that so this is where

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.569 
the capacity to do that so this is where
your<00:03:33.840> numbers<00:03:34.190> should<00:03:35.190> be<00:03:35.220> in<00:03:35.519> a

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
your numbers should be in a

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:37.250 
your numbers should be in a
million-dollar<00:03:35.940> practice<00:03:36.630> for<00:03:36.810> sure<00:03:37.019> and

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
million-dollar practice for sure and

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.039 
million-dollar practice for sure and
even<00:03:37.650> in<00:03:37.829> any<00:03:38.459> of<00:03:38.700> those<00:03:38.850> other<00:03:38.910> levels<00:03:39.720> that<00:03:39.840> I

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
even in any of those other levels that I

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:44.720 
even in any of those other levels that I
showed<00:03:40.380> in<00:03:40.590> the<00:03:40.620> previous<00:03:40.680> slide<00:03:43.400> yes<00:03:44.400> so<00:03:44.579> your

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
showed in the previous slide yes so your

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.910 
showed in the previous slide yes so your
student<00:03:45.150> loans<00:03:45.389> you<00:03:45.569> want<00:03:45.840> to<00:03:45.959> pay<00:03:46.139> so<00:03:46.500> what

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
student loans you want to pay so what

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.830 
student loans you want to pay so what
takes<00:03:47.130> precedence<00:03:47.790> is<00:03:48.120> really<00:03:48.540> your<00:03:48.690> question

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
takes precedence is really your question

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.330 
takes precedence is really your question
and<00:03:49.200> the<00:03:49.260> question<00:03:49.350> was<00:03:49.650> about<00:03:49.799> what<00:03:50.010> about<00:03:50.220> my

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
and the question was about what about my

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.400 
and the question was about what about my
student<00:03:50.760> loans<00:03:50.970> I<00:03:51.269> would<00:03:51.900> say<00:03:52.109> if<00:03:52.290> you're

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
student loans I would say if you're

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.620 
student loans I would say if you're
paying<00:03:52.769> interest<00:03:53.069> on<00:03:53.519> loans<00:03:53.760> pay<00:03:54.209> down<00:03:54.450> the

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
paying interest on loans pay down the

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.520 
paying interest on loans pay down the
debt<00:03:55.040> pay<00:03:56.040> down<00:03:56.250> the<00:03:56.400> debt<00:03:56.579> and<00:03:57.170> put<00:03:58.170> away<00:03:58.290> and

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
debt pay down the debt and put away and

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.110 
debt pay down the debt and put away and
that<00:03:58.620> depends<00:03:59.069> also<00:03:59.190> on<00:03:59.430> the<00:03:59.549> interest<00:03:59.880> rate

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
that depends also on the interest rate

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.000 
that depends also on the interest rate
if<00:04:00.269> you<00:04:00.389> think<00:04:00.600> you<00:04:00.690> can<00:04:00.840> earn<00:04:00.989> more<00:04:01.319> by

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
if you think you can earn more by

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.150 
if you think you can earn more by
investing<00:04:02.579> it<00:04:02.730> then<00:04:03.180> you're<00:04:03.359> paying<00:04:03.660> on<00:04:03.989> the

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
investing it then you're paying on the

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.740 
investing it then you're paying on the
