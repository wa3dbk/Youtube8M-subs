00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.549
 ok let's start immediately with this 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.930
 paper or constellation omega me la 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.930
 I'm exchanged because it's really 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.939
 a card is beautiful in my opinion a 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.490
 part of the image that is that I think that 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.920
 be weird excused graphics for the 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.310
 term two light monsters of level 4 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.829
 this one is fine in laison this one 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.600
 here so this is a card that me 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.280
 I am exchanged then the other 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.930
 paper is constellation eg 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.420
 is a rank 3 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.790
 two level 3 light monsters too 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:46.060
 this one can look good in the showroom 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:49.210
 and the effect we say is pretty good 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.729
 once he says once per shift can 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.320
 to detach a material both from this one 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.270
 card but of all the square monsters from 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.720
 your opponent uncovered in position 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.570
 defense 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:02.260
 so guys i think anyway if he 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:04.690
 has a nice vuitton and a low defense 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.690
 guys, I think I think I can 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.580
 let's say get it off the last card now 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:15.580
 I tell you what a ghost is and e 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:18.900
 boys is a ghost is the c32 little dragon 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.610
 bass gostner shark are put into one 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:26.050
 I don't know how to cover my jacket 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:29.410
 well it is slightly jagged here in here 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.060
 background a little bit and in the image not 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.420
 I know well if you can see but presents 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.040
 some small but some small lines 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.640
 I'm not interested in boys anyway 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:42.100
 nothing is a beautiful card and I think 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.860
 that having given him three numbers boys 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:47.230
 I think I did it too 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.940
 because it's really interesting to me 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.310
 especially the ghost because I'm not 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.620

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:58.810
