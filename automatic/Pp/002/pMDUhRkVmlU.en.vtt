so you can wind the film on there and

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.550 
so you can wind the film on there and
all<00:03:39.590> I've<00:03:39.710> gotta<00:03:39.950> do<00:03:40.070> now<00:03:40.250> is<00:03:41.080> put<00:03:42.080> a<00:03:42.350> lens

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560

together

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:04:01.309 

the<00:03:56.959> shifter<00:03:57.959> sort<00:03:58.200> of<00:03:58.260> opens<00:03:58.590> and<00:03:58.769> closes<00:04:00.319> so

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
the shifter sort of opens and closes so

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:05.440 
the shifter sort of opens and closes so
once<00:04:01.530> we've<00:04:01.709> got<00:04:01.890> the<00:04:02.750> pinhole<00:04:03.750> disc<00:04:04.019> on<00:04:04.290> there

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
once we've got the pinhole disc on there

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.780 
once we've got the pinhole disc on there
then<00:04:05.989> you'll<00:04:06.110> see<00:04:06.319> how<00:04:06.349> it<00:04:06.650> sort<00:04:06.830> of<00:04:06.890> opens<00:04:07.610> for

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
then you'll see how it sort of opens for

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.449 
then you'll see how it sort of opens for
the<00:04:07.879> exposure<00:04:08.300> and<00:04:08.690> then<00:04:08.810> closes<00:04:09.459> that's

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
the exposure and then closes that's

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:37.450 
the exposure and then closes that's
quite<00:04:10.670> a<00:04:10.700> nice<00:04:10.910> little<00:04:11.620> fish<00:04:12.620> until<00:04:12.800> lens

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.120

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
just load the film in the back which

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.650 
just load the film in the back which
I'll<00:04:59.250> do<00:04:59.400> sort<00:04:59.730> of<00:04:59.790> right<00:04:59.970> before<00:05:00.300> we<00:05:00.360> take<00:05:00.570> the

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
I'll do sort of right before we take the

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:01.940 
I'll do sort of right before we take the
shot<00:05:00.900> because<00:05:01.080> I<00:05:01.200> think<00:05:01.260> it's<00:05:01.530> going<00:05:01.710> to<00:05:01.740> leak

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:01.950 
shot because I think it's going to leak

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.700 
shot because I think it's going to leak
loads<00:05:02.190> of<00:05:02.340> light<00:05:02.870> and<00:05:03.870> essentially<00:05:04.260> that's<00:05:04.500> it

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
loads of light and essentially that's it

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.170 
loads of light and essentially that's it
little<00:05:05.070> pinhole<00:05:05.580> camera<00:05:05.970> good<00:05:06.600> stir<00:05:07.760> so<00:05:08.760> we've

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
little pinhole camera good stir so we've

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.730 
little pinhole camera good stir so we've
got<00:05:09.360> the<00:05:09.450> shots<00:05:09.660> back<00:05:09.930> from<00:05:10.110> the<00:05:10.200> developers

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
got the shots back from the developers

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.830 
got the shots back from the developers
and<00:05:11.520> we're<00:05:11.880> all<00:05:12.000> pretty<00:05:12.210> excited<00:05:12.810> because

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
and we're all pretty excited because

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.870 
and we're all pretty excited because
this<00:05:13.290> is<00:05:13.410> essentially<00:05:13.980> a<00:05:14.010> camera<00:05:14.520> that<00:05:14.730> we've

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
this is essentially a camera that we've

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.210 
this is essentially a camera that we've
built<00:05:15.090> ourselves<00:05:15.360> and<00:05:16.320> then<00:05:16.470> taking<00:05:16.830> photos

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
built ourselves and then taking photos

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.880 
built ourselves and then taking photos
with<00:05:17.690> unfortunately<00:05:18.690> as<00:05:18.990> you<00:05:19.080> can<00:05:19.200> see<00:05:19.350> these

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:19.890 
with unfortunately as you can see these

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:23.270 
with unfortunately as you can see these
shots<00:05:20.280> are<00:05:20.670> a<00:05:21.120> little<00:05:21.660> disappointing<00:05:22.320> and<00:05:22.560> as

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
shots are a little disappointing and as

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.520 
shots are a little disappointing and as
a<00:05:23.340> result<00:05:23.700> we've<00:05:23.850> had<00:05:24.000> to<00:05:24.120> let<00:05:24.240> go<00:05:24.270> Steve<00:05:24.690> sorry

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:25.530 
a result we've had to let go Steve sorry

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.790 
a result we've had to let go Steve sorry
Steve<00:05:26.270> but<00:05:27.270> the<00:05:27.390> great<00:05:27.630> thing<00:05:27.660> about<00:05:28.170> pinhole

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
Steve but the great thing about pinhole

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.980 
Steve but the great thing about pinhole
photography<00:05:29.250> is<00:05:29.910> that<00:05:30.240> each<00:05:30.390> time<00:05:30.420> you<00:05:30.780> take<00:05:30.930> a

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
photography is that each time you take a

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:32.090 
photography is that each time you take a
shot<00:05:31.260> it's<00:05:31.530> going<00:05:31.740> to<00:05:31.800> look<00:05:31.890> completely

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100 
shot it's going to look completely

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.470 
shot it's going to look completely
different<00:05:32.460> and<00:05:32.910> it's<00:05:33.030> not<00:05:33.150> going<00:05:33.270> to<00:05:33.360> look

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:33.480 
different and it's not going to look

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.210 
different and it's not going to look
like<00:05:33.540> any<00:05:34.020> of<00:05:34.470> the<00:05:34.560> other<00:05:34.680> shots<00:05:34.920> you've<00:05:35.100> ever

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220 
like any of the other shots you've ever

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.300 
like any of the other shots you've ever
taken<00:05:35.460> before<00:05:36.170> now<00:05:37.170> if<00:05:37.560> you've<00:05:37.770> had<00:05:37.950> a<00:05:37.980> go<00:05:38.160> with

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
taken before now if you've had a go with

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.370 
taken before now if you've had a go with
pinhole<00:05:38.640> photography<00:05:38.940> we'd<00:05:39.690> love<00:05:39.990> to<00:05:40.020> see

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.380 
pinhole photography we'd love to see

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.190
