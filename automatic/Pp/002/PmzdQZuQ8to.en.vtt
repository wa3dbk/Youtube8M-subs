00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
demand but let's do a performance run

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.290 
demand but let's do a performance run
just<00:00:39.420> for<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.719> hell<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:39.899> it<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.290> see<00:00:41.190> how<00:00:41.300> kind

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
just for the hell of it and see how kind

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.770 
just for the hell of it and see how kind
of<00:00:42.360> scores<00:00:42.719> we<00:00:42.870> can<00:00:43.050> get<00:00:43.200> on<00:00:43.410> quadrant<00:00:44.780> it's

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
of scores we can get on quadrant it's

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.410 
of scores we can get on quadrant it's
running<00:00:46.110> stable<00:00:46.530> at<00:00:46.649> one<00:00:46.860> point<00:00:47.039> 704<00:00:47.700> then<00:00:48.360> you

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
running stable at one point 704 then you

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.260 
running stable at one point 704 then you
can<00:00:48.539> push<00:00:48.750> it<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:49.110> 1.8<00:00:49.710> giga<00:00:50.039> hertz<00:00:50.340> maybe<00:00:51.090> I'll

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
can push it to 1.8 giga hertz maybe I'll

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.930 
can push it to 1.8 giga hertz maybe I'll
find<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.809> colonel<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.230> can<00:00:52.379> do<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:52.680> or<00:00:52.940> another

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
find a colonel I can do that or another

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.060 
find a colonel I can do that or another
rom<00:00:54.180> that<00:00:54.360> can<00:00:54.510> do<00:00:54.600> it<00:00:54.750> usually<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.440> like<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.680> I

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
rom that can do it usually I like to I

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.250 
rom that can do it usually I like to I
like<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.670> flash<00:00:56.940> rom<00:00:57.360> with<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.899> colonel

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
like to flash rom with the colonel

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.349 
like to flash rom with the colonel
because<00:00:58.559> usually<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:59.160> developer<00:00:59.760> already

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
because usually the developer already

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.000 
because usually the developer already
tested<00:01:00.809> outs<00:01:00.960> because<00:01:01.230> sometimes<00:01:01.680> some

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
tested outs because sometimes some

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.160 
tested outs because sometimes some
kernels<00:01:02.430> are<00:01:02.579> not<00:01:02.699> compatible<00:01:03.510> with<00:01:03.960> some

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
kernels are not compatible with some

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.590 
kernels are not compatible with some
roms<00:01:04.439> so<00:01:04.949> they<00:01:05.729> kind<00:01:05.970> of<00:01:06.000> go<00:01:06.180> hand<00:01:06.210> in<00:01:06.540> hand

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
roms so they kind of go hand in hand

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.350 
roms so they kind of go hand in hand
together<00:01:07.070> but<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.189> know<00:01:08.310> there's<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.299> know

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
together but you know there's you know

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.620 
together but you know there's you know
you<00:01:09.479> can<00:01:09.720> overclock<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:10.229> even<00:01:10.500> more<00:01:10.680> of<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:10.890> I

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
you can overclock it even more of it I

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.660 
you can overclock it even more of it I
really<00:01:12.630> like<00:01:12.810> this<00:01:13.049> wrong<00:01:13.350> this<00:01:13.979> is<00:01:14.189> one<00:01:14.640> of

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
really like this wrong this is one of

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.520 
really like this wrong this is one of
the<00:01:14.820> better<00:01:15.030> arms<00:01:15.390> I've<00:01:15.540> seen<00:01:15.810> for<00:01:16.080> galaxy

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
the better arms I've seen for galaxy

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.830

functionality and without losing

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.789 
functionality and without losing
anything<00:01:21.869> pretty<00:01:22.320> much<00:01:22.380> um<00:01:24.350> let's<00:01:25.350> look<00:01:25.590> up

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
anything pretty much um let's look up

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.859 
anything pretty much um let's look up
the<00:01:26.130> scores<00:01:27.500> so<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:28.530> got<00:01:28.880> 4857<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:30.240> was<00:01:30.630> getting

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
the scores so I got 4857 I was getting

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.550 
the scores so I got 4857 I was getting
like<00:01:31.009> 5500<00:01:32.009> earlier<00:01:32.400> near<00:01:32.729> 6000<00:01:33.509> so<00:01:33.720> nothing

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
like 5500 earlier near 6000 so nothing

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.469 
like 5500 earlier near 6000 so nothing
just<00:01:34.740> because<00:01:34.890> it's<00:01:35.220> sinking<00:01:35.729> right<00:01:35.850> now<00:01:36.119> but

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
just because it's sinking right now but

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.590 
just because it's sinking right now but
that's<00:01:36.750> pretty<00:01:37.140> decent<00:01:37.710> scores<00:01:38.040> oh<00:01:38.570> but<00:01:39.570> I

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
that's pretty decent scores oh but I

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.999 
that's pretty decent scores oh but I
wouldn't<00:01:40.140> let<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:40.860> run<00:01:41.130> on<00:01:42.439> one<00:01:43.439> performance

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
wouldn't let it run on one performance

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.859 
wouldn't let it run on one performance
that's<00:01:44.430> gonna<00:01:44.579> drain<00:01:44.909> your<00:01:44.939> battery<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.570> make

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
that's gonna drain your battery and make

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.780 
that's gonna drain your battery and make
it<00:01:46.020> hot<00:01:46.670> so<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:47.909> got<00:01:48.329> it<00:01:48.450> on<00:01:48.570> demand<00:01:48.810> um<00:01:49.790> other

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
it hot so I got it on demand um other

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.190 
it hot so I got it on demand um other
than<00:01:51.060> that<00:01:51.540> it's<00:01:51.930> very<00:01:52.259> very<00:01:52.560> smooth<00:01:53.030> I<00:01:54.200> really

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
than that it's very very smooth I really
