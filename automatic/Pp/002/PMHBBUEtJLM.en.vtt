00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.650

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:23.100

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:29.460

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:44.970
 notification or not if it is not invisible 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.970
 Seeing up there is assuming 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.430
 but this does not change much here but here 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.729
 It's going to change a lot, see. 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.930
 these three squares on the side of the 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.540
 general 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.200
 so here is where you'll make the 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.850
 things 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:06.390

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.000
 So how do I go, I want him? 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.010

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:20.220

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:22.290

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.900

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.830

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.300

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.390
 from top to bottom 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.700
 if yours is not underneath and you do not want 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.850
 from the top then low as well and 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:51.180
