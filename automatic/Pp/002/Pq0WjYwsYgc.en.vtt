00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.800 

now<00:04:40.430> that<00:04:40.610> should<00:04:40.730> be<00:04:40.820> all<00:04:40.850> for<00:04:41.150> clues<00:04:41.480> let's

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
now that should be all for clues let's

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.470 
now that should be all for clues let's
see<00:04:42.050> if<00:04:42.310> let's<00:04:43.310> see<00:04:43.430> if<00:04:43.520> that<00:04:43.550> guy<00:04:43.730> matches<00:04:44.090> up

turbo

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.770 

next<00:04:52.360> next<00:04:52.630> next<00:04:54.030> no<00:04:55.030> he<00:04:55.270> does<00:04:55.420> not<00:04:55.450> have<00:04:55.660> an

what'll<00:07:44.789> said<00:07:46.909> well<00:07:49.879> since<00:07:50.879> the<00:07:50.999> game<00:07:51.149> based

00:07:51.439 --> 00:07:51.449

way<00:07:51.599> this<00:07:51.749> goes<00:07:51.930> on<00:07:52.199> being<00:07:52.770> the<00:07:52.889> same<00:07:53.099> I<00:07:53.129> think

00:07:53.799 --> 00:07:53.809 
way this goes on being the same I think

00:07:53.809 --> 00:07:57.339 
way this goes on being the same I think
for<00:07:54.809> the<00:07:54.839> moment<00:07:55.189> then<00:07:56.189> a<00:07:56.219> quick<00:07:56.460> look<00:07:56.669> will<00:07:56.849> do

00:07:57.339 --> 00:07:57.349 
for the moment then a quick look will do

00:07:57.349 --> 00:07:59.329 
for the moment then a quick look will do
unless<00:07:58.349> people<00:07:58.589> are<00:07:58.620> really<00:07:58.800> interested<00:07:59.009> in

unless people are really interested in

00:07:59.339 --> 00:08:04.069 
unless people are really interested in
seeing<00:07:59.669> more<00:07:59.909> of<00:07:59.939> the<00:08:00.059> same<00:08:00.919> hole<00:08:01.919> later
