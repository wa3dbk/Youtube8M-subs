00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
I'll give you a track at 165 which i

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.760 
I'll give you a track at 165 which i
think<00:05:13.520> is<00:05:13.880> probably<00:05:14.090> a<00:05:14.330> good<00:05:14.509> tempo<00:05:14.960> for<00:05:15.710> a

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
think is probably a good tempo for a

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.430 
think is probably a good tempo for a
student<00:05:16.130> to<00:05:16.159> play<00:05:16.370> it<00:05:16.490> at<00:05:16.880> and<00:05:17.240> you<00:05:17.930> can<00:05:18.139> go<00:05:18.289> out

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:18.440 
student to play it at and you can go out

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.610 
student to play it at and you can go out
