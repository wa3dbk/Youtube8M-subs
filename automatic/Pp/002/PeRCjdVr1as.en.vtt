00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.469
 it is a protein causing vitiligo 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.390
 the discovery of a Paduan researcher 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:21.710
 opens new perspectives for the care of 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:24.230
 Skin disease is the first in the world 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.970
 to have identified the protein that 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.039
 seems to be the real cause of the 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.380
 vitiligo a skin disease that 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.719
 so far it had always been attributed to a 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.760
 immune system malfunction 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:37.039
 we are talking about matteo bordignon 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.840
 Paduan researcher who hardly 

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:40.730
 published the results of this study 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.879
 which could envisage new ones 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.800
 possibility in the therapeutic field 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:47.839
 the patients who were subjected to 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.850
 traditional therapies especially that 

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:51.019
 depresses immune system does not 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.639
 they were fine 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:55.069
 the stains continued to persist 

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:56.569
 often even for the great had 

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:58.069
 for us therefore clear that he owed us 

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:59.569
 be another way 

00:00:58.069 --> 00:01:01.280
 the road taken in Veneto opens 

00:00:59.569 --> 00:01:03.049
 new frontiers for the care of 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.059
 vitiligo skin disease that yes 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:07.100
 manifest with the formation of the square and 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.780
 skin for the first time a group of 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.280
 research of the university of 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.560
 Padova led by Dr. Matteo 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.030
 bordignon managed to identify one 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.979
 protein that could be the 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.840
 responsible for the pathology until now 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.360
 attributed to a malfunction of 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.920
 immune system this protein 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.299
 acts in plain words by cutting the 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.950
 connections that the cells that give the 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.729
 color our skin that they are called 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.229
 melanocytes entertain with the skin 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:35.630
 cut these connections these 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.520
 cells remain at the mercy we say 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.609
 of the surrounding environment and come 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.070
 therefore lost hesitating in training 

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:44.950
 patches to chronic that is true 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.750
 clinical manifestation of vitiligo 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.670
 to suffer from the 100 best disease 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.259
 of patients in the world one million in 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.909
 Italy 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:55.100
 the cause will be identified 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.890
 probably easier to get to one 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.560
 we also hope for a definitive cure from the first 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.570
 data we have this protein can 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.570
 to be effectively in drink and 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.550
 we hope to resolve 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:10.020
 finally this once and for all 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.020
 severe skin problem
