00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
up down and the idea is the same when

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.690 
up down and the idea is the same when
you're<00:01:51.750> playing<00:01:52.289> more<00:01:52.860> than<00:01:53.009> one<00:01:53.159> note<00:01:53.430> per

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.389 
you're playing more than one note per
string<00:01:53.820> then<00:01:54.330> you<00:01:54.360> can<00:01:54.630> alternate<00:01:55.320> but<00:01:56.009> when

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
string then you can alternate but when

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.570 
string then you can alternate but when
you're<00:01:56.549> changing<00:01:57.000> a<00:01:57.090> string<00:01:58.310> then<00:01:59.310> you<00:01:59.460> use

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
you're changing a string then you use

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:00.669 
you're changing a string then you use

this<00:02:01.679> is<00:02:01.800> very<00:02:02.009> effective<00:02:02.819> and<00:02:03.450> easy<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.780> play
