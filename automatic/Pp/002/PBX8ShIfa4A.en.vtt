00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.119
 later we were still trying 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.159
 to wait and I felt a lot 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.689
 better we decided to go back 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.369
 to go out we took the elevator 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.570
 the elevator got stuck and I got 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.010

 that they could not happen to us worse 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.420

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.980

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.600

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.080

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.670
