00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
is covered with water as you can see the

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.050 
is covered with water as you can see the
chicken<00:03:03.600> is<00:03:03.960> covered<00:03:04.410> in<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:04.650> water<00:03:05.060> is

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
chicken is covered in the water is

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.350 
chicken is covered in the water is
present<00:03:06.690> and<00:03:07.170> that<00:03:07.370> is<00:03:08.370> pretty<00:03:08.670> much<00:03:08.910> covered

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
present and that is pretty much covered

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.530 
present and that is pretty much covered
and<00:03:09.570> I<00:03:09.990> is<00:03:10.050> enough<00:03:10.380> water<00:03:10.620> it<00:03:11.340> depends<00:03:11.910> on<00:03:12.030> the

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
and I is enough water it depends on the

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.530 
and I is enough water it depends on the
pot<00:03:12.780> size<00:03:13.080> so<00:03:13.620> for<00:03:13.920> me<00:03:14.640> it<00:03:14.850> was<00:03:15.000> about<00:03:15.150> five

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
pot size so for me it was about five

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.040 
pot size so for me it was about five
hundred<00:03:15.750> mils<00:03:16.200> to<00:03:16.970> 700<00:03:17.970> so<00:03:18.360> it<00:03:18.570> depends<00:03:18.959> on

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
hundred mils to 700 so it depends on

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.160 
hundred mils to 700 so it depends on
your

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.920 

after<00:03:23.980> about<00:03:24.190> five<00:03:24.490> minutes<00:03:25.330> he<00:03:25.780> hasn't

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
after about five minutes he hasn't

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.770 
after about five minutes he hasn't
boiled<00:03:26.410> yet<00:03:26.620> but<00:03:27.310> you<00:03:27.459> put<00:03:27.760> your<00:03:28.030> black<00:03:28.480> sauce

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
boiled yet but you put your black sauce

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.370 
boiled yet but you put your black sauce
in<00:03:29.100> about<00:03:30.100> four<00:03:30.490> tablespoons<00:03:31.380> four

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
in about four tablespoons four

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.530 
in about four tablespoons four
tablespoons<00:03:32.950> will<00:03:33.160> make<00:03:33.310> the<00:03:33.790> color<00:03:34.120> of<00:03:34.390> the

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
tablespoons will make the color of the

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.820 
tablespoons will make the color of the
chicken<00:03:35.069> average<00:03:36.069> dark<00:03:36.640> not<00:03:37.480> really<00:03:38.290> duck<00:03:38.500> but
