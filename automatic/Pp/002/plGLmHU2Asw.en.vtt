00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
same aspects of an iron golem except I

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.969 
same aspects of an iron golem except I

at<00:02:00.740> somebody<00:02:01.740> they<00:02:02.070> don't<00:02:02.100> actually<00:02:02.399> take

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
at somebody they don't actually take

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.149 
at somebody they don't actually take
damage<00:02:03.659> so<00:02:04.229> when<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:04.439> throw<00:02:04.590> snow<00:02:04.829> when<00:02:05.070> you

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
damage so when you throw snow when you

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.830 
damage so when you throw snow when you
throw<00:02:05.340> snowballs<00:02:05.610> at<00:02:05.969> like<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.180> spider<00:02:06.630> that

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
throw snowballs at like a spider that

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.529 
throw snowballs at like a spider that
comes<00:02:07.049> at<00:02:07.200> you<00:02:07.729> this<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:09.030> spider<00:02:09.270> won't

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
comes at you this the spider won't

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.270 
comes at you this the spider won't
actually<00:02:09.720> get<00:02:10.020> hurt<00:02:10.259> but<00:02:10.709> what<00:02:10.860> he<00:02:10.920> does<00:02:11.099> is

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
actually get hurt but what he does is

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.430 
actually get hurt but what he does is
basically<00:02:11.430> hold<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.060> spider<00:02:12.239> at<00:02:12.480> bay<00:02:12.690> so<00:02:13.260> if

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
basically hold the spider at bay so if

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.059 
basically hold the spider at bay so if
you<00:02:13.530> have

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
you have

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.069 
you have
no<00:02:14.189> man<00:02:14.400> and<00:02:14.640> an<00:02:14.849> iron<00:02:15.060> golem<00:02:15.209> it's<00:02:15.659> like<00:02:15.959> the

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:16.079 
no man and an iron golem it's like the

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:18.379 
no man and an iron golem it's like the
perfect<00:02:16.230> game<00:02:16.530> because<00:02:16.859> the<00:02:17.010> Snowman<00:02:17.909> will

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:18.389 
perfect game because the Snowman will

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:20.149 
perfect game because the Snowman will
throw<00:02:18.629> the<00:02:18.780> snowballs<00:02:19.200> at<00:02:19.469> the<00:02:19.499> mob<00:02:19.920> or

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:20.159 
throw the snowballs at the mob or

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:22.459 
throw the snowballs at the mob or
whatever<00:02:20.459> and<00:02:20.730> then<00:02:21.269> that<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:22.139> mob<00:02:22.319> will

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:22.469 
whatever and then that the mob will

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:24.199 
whatever and then that the mob will
actually<00:02:22.769> be<00:02:22.889> trapped<00:02:23.249> because<00:02:23.519> the

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
actually be trapped because the

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:25.940 
actually be trapped because the
snowballs<00:02:24.659> are<00:02:24.810> pushing<00:02:25.109> them<00:02:25.200> back<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:25.620> then

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
snowballs are pushing them back and then

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.860 
snowballs are pushing them back and then
the<00:02:26.129> iron<00:02:26.370> golem<00:02:26.670> can<00:02:26.879> basically<00:02:27.030> go<00:02:27.389> over<00:02:27.659> and

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
the iron golem can basically go over and

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.839 
the iron golem can basically go over and
take<00:02:28.200> him<00:02:28.349> down<00:02:28.469> so<00:02:28.739> that's<00:02:29.099> basically<00:02:29.310> what

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
take him down so that's basically what

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.940 
take him down so that's basically what
his<00:02:29.999> attack<00:02:30.359> features<00:02:31.079> are<00:02:31.290> is<00:02:31.439> just<00:02:31.650> throwing

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
his attack features are is just throwing

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.569 
his attack features are is just throwing
snowballs<00:02:32.359> and<00:02:33.359> yeah<00:02:34.349> and<00:02:34.620> then<00:02:34.920> also<00:02:35.099> when

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579 
snowballs and yeah and then also when

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:38.270 
snowballs and yeah and then also when
they<00:02:36.389> walk<00:02:36.659> when<00:02:37.439> they<00:02:37.560> walk<00:02:37.769> across<00:02:38.040> the

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
they walk when they walk across the

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.369 
they walk when they walk across the
floor<00:02:38.400> they<00:02:38.760> will<00:02:38.969> usually<00:02:39.120> leave<00:02:39.599> a<00:02:39.900> trail<00:02:40.349> of

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
floor they will usually leave a trail of

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:45.110 
floor they will usually leave a trail of
snow<00:02:40.829> behind<00:02:41.750> so<00:02:43.459> this<00:02:44.459> whole<00:02:44.669> room<00:02:44.939> is

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
snow behind so this whole room is

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.300 
snow behind so this whole room is
actually<00:02:45.269> made<00:02:45.780> of<00:02:46.019> snow<00:02:46.260> so<00:02:46.469> you<00:02:46.560> guys<00:02:47.189> won't

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
actually made of snow so you guys won't

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.129 
actually made of snow so you guys won't
be<00:02:47.489> able<00:02:47.609> to<00:02:47.730> see<00:02:47.939> any<00:02:48.599> snow<00:02:48.810> being<00:02:48.989> left

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:49.139 
be able to see any snow being left

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:52.309 
be able to see any snow being left
behind<00:02:49.260> from<00:02:49.590> him<00:02:49.799> but<00:02:50.400> usually<00:02:51.359> as<00:02:51.989> they<00:02:52.139> walk

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
behind from him but usually as they walk

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:53.539 
behind from him but usually as they walk
around<00:02:52.469> they<00:02:52.680> leave<00:02:52.829> a<00:02:52.859> trail<00:02:53.099> of<00:02:53.129> snow<00:02:53.370> and

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
around they leave a trail of snow and

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:55.009 
around they leave a trail of snow and
then<00:02:53.669> you<00:02:53.760> can<00:02:53.909> get<00:02:54.120> more<00:02:54.269> snow<00:02:54.510> and<00:02:54.659> make<00:02:54.780> more

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
then you can get more snow and make more

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.270 
then you can get more snow and make more
snowmen<00:02:55.109> and<00:02:55.530> basically<00:02:55.829> have<00:02:56.010> a<00:02:56.069> gold

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
snowmen and basically have a gold

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.699 
snowmen and basically have a gold
snowman<00:02:56.760> farm<00:02:57.090> if<00:02:57.299> you<00:02:57.329> wanted<00:02:57.659> to<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:58.260> then

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
snowman farm if you wanted to and then

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.589 
snowman farm if you wanted to and then
one<00:02:59.099> other<00:02:59.219> thing<00:02:59.549> is<00:02:59.730> when<00:02:59.909> you<00:03:00.000> kill<00:03:00.359> them

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
one other thing is when you kill them

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.740 
one other thing is when you kill them
they<00:03:01.500> leave<00:03:01.799> snowballs<00:03:02.549> behind<00:03:02.909> so<00:03:03.150> if<00:03:03.449> you

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
they leave snowballs behind so if you

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.780 
they leave snowballs behind so if you
kill<00:03:04.019> the<00:03:04.590> Snowman<00:03:05.010> you<00:03:05.159> don't<00:03:05.340> get<00:03:05.549> the
