specifically<00:01:12.210> said<00:01:12.510> those<00:01:12.750> devices<00:01:13.260> at<00:01:13.770> the

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
specifically said those devices at the

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.890 
specifically said those devices at the
start<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.369> video<00:01:14.640> because<00:01:15.420> those<00:01:15.600> device

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
start the video because those device

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.249 
start the video because those device
have<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.320> new<00:01:16.500> autofocus<00:01:17.340> feature<00:01:17.600> so<00:01:18.600> he

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
have the new autofocus feature so he

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.050 
have the new autofocus feature so he
right<00:01:19.470> here<00:01:19.650> I<00:01:19.830> was<00:01:20.100> in<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.280> top<00:01:20.490> it's<00:01:20.850> going

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
right here I was in the top it's going

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.249 
right here I was in the top it's going
to<00:01:21.119> also<00:01:21.509> focus<00:01:21.780> see<00:01:23.570> so<00:01:24.570> that's<00:01:24.720> because<00:01:25.110> the

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
to also focus see so that's because the

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.620 
to also focus see so that's because the
lens<00:01:25.470> inside<00:01:25.890> they<00:01:26.340> move<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.909> focus<00:01:27.330> on<00:01:27.509> the

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
lens inside they move to focus on the

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.280 
lens inside they move to focus on the
picture<00:01:27.780> that's<00:01:28.320> why<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:28.650> noise<00:01:28.829> is<00:01:29.070> now<00:01:29.880> the

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
picture that's why that noise is now the

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.770 
picture that's why that noise is now the
technology<00:01:31.290> in<00:01:31.560> this<00:01:31.860> camera<00:01:32.159> so<00:01:32.520> smooth<00:01:32.850> that

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
technology in this camera so smooth that
