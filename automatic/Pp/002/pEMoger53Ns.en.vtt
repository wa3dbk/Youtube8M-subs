a stick go outside and get some sticks
whatever<00:01:50.430> you<00:01:50.850> can<00:01:51.060> find<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:52.049> children<00:01:52.350> can

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
whatever you can find that children can

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.770 
whatever you can find that children can
hold<00:01:52.920> on<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.430> great<00:01:55.100> so<00:01:56.100> what<00:01:57.060> these<00:01:57.420> will

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
hold on to is great so what these will

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.109 
hold on to is great so what these will
do<00:01:58.020> is<00:01:58.350> once<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:58.920> fill<00:01:59.250> this<00:01:59.430> up<00:01:59.640> with<00:01:59.700> water

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
do is once you fill this up with water

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.050 
do is once you fill this up with water
and<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:01.259> food<00:02:01.500> coloring<00:02:01.770> then<00:02:02.399> you<00:02:02.549> can<00:02:02.759> put

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
and the food coloring then you can put

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.110 
and the food coloring then you can put
these<00:02:03.240> in<00:02:03.299> of<00:02:03.780> course<00:02:04.290> they'll<00:02:04.530> just

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:05.120 
these in of course they'll just

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.810 
these in of course they'll just
like<00:02:05.540> that<00:02:05.860> because<00:02:06.860> it<00:02:07.040> won't<00:02:07.220> be<00:02:07.370> hard<00:02:07.670> when

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
like that because it won't be hard when

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.180 
like that because it won't be hard when
you<00:02:07.940> put<00:02:08.119> in<00:02:08.240> it<00:02:08.420> I'll<00:02:08.540> be<00:02:08.720> just<00:02:09.050> liquid<00:02:09.470> and<00:02:09.830> so

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
you put in it I'll be just liquid and so

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.190 
you put in it I'll be just liquid and so
you<00:02:10.280> can<00:02:10.460> just<00:02:10.640> lay<00:02:10.910> them<00:02:11.090> in<00:02:11.270> there<00:02:11.480> and<00:02:11.690> then

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
you can just lay them in there and then

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.070 
you can just lay them in there and then
what<00:02:12.440> happens<00:02:12.860> is<00:02:12.980> when<00:02:13.160> it's<00:02:13.310> frozen<00:02:14.050> you<00:02:15.050> can

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
what happens is when it's frozen you can

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.920 
what happens is when it's frozen you can
pull<00:02:15.500> it<00:02:15.680> out<00:02:15.830> and<00:02:16.220> then<00:02:16.820> the<00:02:17.030> ice<00:02:17.270> cube<00:02:17.750> will

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
pull it out and then the ice cube will

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.200 
pull it out and then the ice cube will
be<00:02:17.960> stuck<00:02:18.500> to<00:02:18.710> the<00:02:18.800> popsicle<00:02:19.400> stick<00:02:19.640> so<00:02:20.030> then

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.210 
be stuck to the popsicle stick so then

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:21.880 
be stuck to the popsicle stick so then
they<00:02:20.360> have<00:02:20.450> something<00:02:20.690> to<00:02:20.810> hold<00:02:21.080> on<00:02:21.350> to<00:02:21.380> to

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
they have something to hold on to to

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.740 
they have something to hold on to to
paint<00:02:22.460> with<00:02:22.670> okay

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
paint with okay

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.290 
paint with okay
that's<00:02:24.140> only<00:02:24.560> purpose<00:02:25.430> for<00:02:25.460> these<00:02:25.850> so<00:02:26.120> if<00:02:26.210> you

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
that's only purpose for these so if you

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.090 
that's only purpose for these so if you
don't<00:02:26.450> have<00:02:26.660> any<00:02:26.870> of<00:02:27.020> those<00:02:27.140> and<00:02:27.440> children

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
don't have any of those and children

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.010 
don't have any of those and children
don't<00:02:28.160> mind<00:02:28.400> getting<00:02:28.700> their<00:02:28.910> hands<00:02:29.270> cold<00:02:29.660> and

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
don't mind getting their hands cold and

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.300 
don't mind getting their hands cold and
and<00:02:30.200> wet<00:02:31.100> and<00:02:31.580> food<00:02:32.450> coloring<00:02:33.010> colors<00:02:34.010> on

and wet and food coloring colors on
their<00:02:34.490> hands<00:02:34.970> then<00:02:35.330> don't<00:02:35.750> use<00:02:35.960> the<00:02:36.170> popsicle

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710 
their hands then don't use the popsicle

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:37.150 
their hands then don't use the popsicle
stick

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
stick

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.890 
stick
they<00:02:37.340> don't<00:02:37.490> mind<00:02:37.640> just<00:02:37.970> using<00:02:38.330> their<00:02:38.450> hands

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
they don't mind just using their hands

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.210 
they don't mind just using their hands
to<00:02:39.100> hold<00:02:40.100> on<00:02:40.310> to<00:02:40.520> the<00:02:40.670> ice<00:02:41.210> cube<00:02:41.570> that's<00:02:41.840> great

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
to hold on to the ice cube that's great

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.920 
to hold on to the ice cube that's great
but<00:02:43.220> that's<00:02:43.400> the<00:02:43.580> whole<00:02:43.700> purpose<00:02:43.850> of<00:02:44.180> that<00:02:44.240> so

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
but that's the whole purpose of that so

the color have them count how many drops
go<00:03:57.830> in<00:03:58.010> so<00:03:58.220> they're<00:03:58.370> working<00:03:58.730> on<00:03:58.880> numbers<00:03:59.810> as

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
go in so they're working on numbers as

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.830 
go in so they're working on numbers as
well<00:04:00.290> and<00:04:00.590> counting<00:04:01.070> in<00:04:01.220> rope<00:04:01.430> counting<00:04:01.880> these

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
well and counting in rope counting these

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.229 
well and counting in rope counting these
are<00:04:03.019> great<00:04:03.200> skills<00:04:03.590> okay<00:04:04.070> and<00:04:04.340> then<00:04:04.820> have<00:04:05.060> them

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
are great skills okay and then have them

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:08.259 
are great skills okay and then have them
put<00:04:05.510> the<00:04:05.989> popsicle<00:04:06.560> stick<00:04:06.830> in<00:04:06.980> each<00:04:07.190> one<00:04:07.489> okay

put the popsicle stick in each one okay

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:10.690 
put the popsicle stick in each one okay
and<00:04:08.510> then<00:04:08.870> when<00:04:09.080> they're<00:04:09.230> frozen<00:04:09.519> take<00:04:10.519> them

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
and then when they're frozen take them

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.910 
and then when they're frozen take them
out<00:04:10.880> pull<00:04:11.690> them<00:04:11.900> out<00:04:12.050> with<00:04:12.230> a<00:04:12.260> popsicle<00:04:12.890> stick
