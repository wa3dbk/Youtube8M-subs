00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:02.960
 RiMinoru Nasan Hello 

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.720
 It is Soichiro Hoshi who is a difficult player 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.779
 An angle that makes the station difficult and doubles difficult 

00:00:08.779 --> 00:00:10.309
 I'm Mar, but 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:13.099
 I sang this time 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:16.179
 Ya revealed a damaged mechanical type 

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:19.449
 I'm sad to say that 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:20.710
 It is English 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.039
 Second wave 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.589
 But it will be a little before, but it will be before but Moe 

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:28.869
 Let's play against vocals in the first round of Kanto tournament 

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:33.480
 It was an acrobatic body and was commissioned to work with people 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.860
 Though 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.550
 Be conservative 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.670
 I lost the heat 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.370
 From then on 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.930
 I feel lonely that everyone in the agreement can only board with support 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.180
 Did 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.740
 Yeah 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.179
 I was able to win 

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:51.209
 The sound that you will not come out of that also in such a situation 

00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:53.960
 It has become, but it will be released soon 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.130
 When I forgot 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.590
 Ship in 8 days 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.850
 Before you 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.170
 English and that one is a turn 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.190
 I'm solo but 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.190
 When setting up, it is always doubles and large 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.750
 I will share the image 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.870
 That's why I'm really single since this time 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:18.990
 Well once in a while 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.990
 I want to do it alone 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.360
 That's why I sang it but 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.130
 How was that 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.680
 I think it was done rolled 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.280
 Rakuten's fourth place Skane 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.080
 It is called enjoy Korea place 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.800
 I say good condition 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.410
 Takeda Takeda has a long tradition 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.470
 When I got Elekashimone I was laughing a little 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.520
 The total amount of rice and its 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.010
 Moonsalto 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.910
 I want to fly 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.760
 Oh, but it was an example that ends with animation but it was off when I saw it 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.550
 It's a great flight 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.820
 I used to throw jokes 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.290
 I've been following from my head 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.170
 You stand on the street that you will overtake it 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.230
 There is a good feeling of mixing in Matsuo 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.380
 I thought this song in the dirt 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.630
 Then 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.779
 How was it that you actually tried to sing 

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:12.529
 Yeah actually hit 

00:02:12.529 --> 00:02:14.609
 This wedding-yo 

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:17.869
 Visually with that heart 

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:19.919
 It may be said that it is small 

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:23.259
 One piece feeling cute wearing the economy 

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:24.669
 Because it feels like 

00:02:24.669 --> 00:02:26.689
 I also think that I am happy to be fired 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:28.139
 Why not 

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:29.979
 A little cool ahead 

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:33.129
 It feels like something a bit of bad personality 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:36.389
 It was done 

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:37.939
 The stage is pretty weird 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:41.099
 I think this will go around a little too much 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:42.069
 not to mention 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:44.049
 Yeah Mark Kane 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:46.079
 Yup 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:47.709
 Without thinking too much 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.749
 I was standing in Tokyo but 

00:02:49.749 --> 00:02:52.169
 How was everyone 

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:53.999
 Was it gackt 

00:02:53.999 --> 00:02:55.839
 If you think it is gackt 

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:57.299
 Happy 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:00.299
 What i think 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:02.729
 Well anyway 

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:06.219
 Winning want you to revive the forehead to the main story quickly 

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:09.219
 The game itself is necessary 

00:03:14.249 --> 00:03:16.219
 In the area 

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:19.219
 I would like to conclude with this line of dac 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:23.649
 we 

00:03:23.649 --> 00:03:25.339
 Does it mean to fly more
