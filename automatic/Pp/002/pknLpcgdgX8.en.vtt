well<00:01:00.570> -<00:01:00.809> if<00:01:00.870> I<00:01:01.020> would<00:01:01.260> say<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.620> Porsche<00:01:01.980> will

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
well - if I would say the Porsche will

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.520 
well - if I would say the Porsche will
be<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.579> quickest<00:01:03.059> but<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.960> conditions<00:01:04.439> are

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
be the quickest but the conditions are

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.950 
be the quickest but the conditions are
very<00:01:04.589> tricky<00:01:04.979> so<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.789> BMW<00:01:06.360> is<00:01:06.479> very<00:01:06.750> very

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
very tricky so the BMW is very very

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.899 
very tricky so the BMW is very very
powerful<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.770> I<00:01:08.039> think<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.369> balance<00:01:08.579> is

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
powerful and I think the balance is

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.000 
powerful and I think the balance is
easier<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.360> handle<00:01:09.659> today<00:01:10.049> I'm<00:01:10.320> gonna<00:01:10.470> take

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
easier to handle today I'm gonna take

yeah<00:05:33.499> the<00:05:34.009> test<00:05:34.340> was<00:05:34.610> not<00:05:34.789> an<00:05:34.969> exit<00:05:35.389> I<00:05:35.479> was<00:05:35.569> the

00:05:35.679 --> 00:05:35.689 
yeah the test was not an exit I was the

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:39.279 
yeah the test was not an exit I was the

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:39.289 
speed I was too afraid to watch but I

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:46.179 
speed I was too afraid to watch but I
might<00:05:40.249> be<00:05:40.490> 78<00:05:43.059> in<00:05:44.059> fact<00:05:44.389> it<00:05:44.689> was<00:05:44.900> 78<00:05:45.289> point<00:05:45.889> two

00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:46.189

miles<00:05:46.580> an<00:05:46.819> hour<00:05:46.999> 12<00:05:47.749> miles<00:05:48.050> now<00:05:48.259> quicker<00:05:48.620> than

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:48.979 
miles an hour 12 miles now quicker than

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:51.879 
miles an hour 12 miles now quicker than
the<00:05:49.099> BMW<00:05:49.849> but<00:05:50.120> as<00:05:50.629> expected<00:05:51.050> it's<00:05:51.499> the<00:05:51.620> front

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:51.889 
the BMW but as expected it's the front

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:54.100 
the BMW but as expected it's the front
wheels<00:05:52.099> that<00:05:52.370> let<00:05:52.550> go<00:05:52.759> first<00:05:53.089> if<00:05:53.930> I<00:05:54.050> can

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:54.110 
wheels that let go first if I can

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:55.659 
wheels that let go first if I can
improve<00:05:54.499> the<00:05:54.680> Porsche<00:05:54.919> I<00:05:55.129> just<00:05:55.370> make<00:05:55.520> it

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:55.669 
improve the Porsche I just make it

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:59.049 
improve the Porsche I just make it
turning<00:05:56.240> a<00:05:56.360> bit<00:05:56.599> better<00:05:56.960> it<00:05:57.289> just<00:05:57.849> unlist<00:05:58.849> is

00:05:59.049 --> 00:05:59.059 
turning a bit better it just unlist is

00:05:59.059 --> 00:06:00.850 
turning a bit better it just unlist is
