just really really into a plan this
harmonica<00:00:33.510> basically<00:00:34.500> we<00:00:34.710> have<00:00:35.010> is<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.760> first

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
harmonica basically we have is the first

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.450 
harmonica basically we have is the first
six<00:00:36.510> holes<00:00:36.600> were<00:00:37.079> regular<00:00:37.559> Richter<00:00:38.250> tuned

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
six holes were regular Richter tuned

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.420 
six holes were regular Richter tuned
harmonica<00:00:39.180> no<00:00:39.719> psycho<00:00:40.620> has<00:00:40.890> different

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
harmonica no psycho has different

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.400 
harmonica no psycho has different
versions<00:00:41.850> of<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.059> big<00:00:42.270> six<00:00:42.540> some<00:00:42.809> with<00:00:43.020> upper

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
versions of the big six some with upper

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.389 
versions of the big six some with upper
register<00:00:43.950> notes<00:00:44.420> and<00:00:45.890> different<00:00:46.890> types<00:00:47.280> of

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
register notes and different types of

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.250 
register notes and different types of
combs<00:00:47.730> that<00:00:48.000> you<00:00:48.120> can<00:00:48.300> get<00:00:48.480> but<00:00:48.930> this<00:00:49.110> one

small<00:01:25.909> harmonica<00:01:26.909> that's<00:01:27.090> made<00:01:27.360> very<00:01:27.390> very

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
small harmonica that's made very very

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.020 
small harmonica that's made very very
well<00:01:28.350> when<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:28.979> get<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.130> hug<00:01:29.430> we<00:01:29.790> need<00:01:30.000> a

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
well when you get a hug we need a

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.710 
well when you get a hug we need a
harmonica<00:01:30.720> from<00:01:30.960> Siler<00:01:31.290> they<00:01:32.509> really<00:01:33.509> really

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
harmonica from Siler they really really

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.890 
harmonica from Siler they really really
don't<00:01:33.869> crank<00:01:34.140> out<00:01:34.320> bad<00:01:34.560> carbs<00:01:35.390> it's<00:01:36.390> just<00:01:36.750> a

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
don't crank out bad carbs it's just a

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.960 
don't crank out bad carbs it's just a
very<00:01:37.320> well-made<00:01:38.509> German<00:01:39.590> harmonica<00:01:40.590> so<00:01:41.220> when

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
very well-made German harmonica so when

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.219 
very well-made German harmonica so when
you<00:01:42.030> see<00:01:42.240> someone<00:01:42.479> pulling<00:01:42.869> out<00:01:42.990> something

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
you see someone pulling out something

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.700 
you see someone pulling out something
like<00:01:43.500> this<00:01:43.670> you<00:01:44.670> assume<00:01:45.030> it's<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.329> toy<00:01:45.540> but<00:01:46.380> in

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
like this you assume it's a toy but in

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.999 
like this you assume it's a toy but in
this<00:01:47.340> case<00:01:47.610> it's<00:01:47.939> not<00:01:48.210> this<00:01:48.930> is<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.320> sidle<00:01:49.799> big

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
this case it's not this is the sidle big

00:01:50.009 --> 00:02:29.440 
this case it's not this is the sidle big
six<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:51.060> should<00:01:51.270> definitely<00:01:51.659> try<00:01:51.840> one

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.160 

you<00:02:30.450> know<00:02:30.569> when<00:02:30.690> you're<00:02:30.780> playing<00:02:30.989> the

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
you know when you're playing the

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.650 
you know when you're playing the
harmonica<00:02:31.800> like<00:02:31.950> this<00:02:32.190> one<00:02:33.150> would<00:02:33.360> assume

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
harmonica like this one would assume

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.410 
harmonica like this one would assume
that<00:02:33.989> the<00:02:34.200> holes<00:02:34.590> are<00:02:34.799> smaller<00:02:35.160> but<00:02:35.880> this<00:02:36.180> is

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
that the holes are smaller but this is

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.140 
that the holes are smaller but this is
actually<00:02:36.950> the<00:02:37.950> same<00:02:38.160> exact<00:02:38.549> size<00:02:38.760> is<00:02:39.000> a

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
actually the same exact size is a

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.059 
actually the same exact size is a
regular<00:02:39.600> harmonic<00:02:40.230> this<00:02:40.350> holds<00:02:40.680> one<00:02:40.860> through

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
regular harmonic this holds one through

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:42.650 
regular harmonic this holds one through
six<00:02:41.340> so<00:02:41.819> keep<00:02:42.000> that<00:02:42.150> in<00:02:42.209> mind

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
six so keep that in mind

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.390 
six so keep that in mind
there's<00:02:42.810> no<00:02:42.930> adjustments<00:02:43.470> to<00:02:43.560> be<00:02:43.709> made<00:02:44.069> other

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
there's no adjustments to be made other

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.340 
there's no adjustments to be made other
than<00:02:44.700> remembering<00:02:45.269> that<00:02:45.600> the<00:02:45.750> last<00:02:45.989> four

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
than remembering that the last four

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.500 
than remembering that the last four
holes<00:02:46.530> are<00:02:46.799> going<00:02:47.000> hopefully<00:02:48.000> you<00:02:48.090> liked<00:02:48.330> this

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
holes are going hopefully you liked this

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.449 
holes are going hopefully you liked this
