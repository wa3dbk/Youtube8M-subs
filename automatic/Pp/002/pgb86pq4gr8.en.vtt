00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
next I'm gonna do is duplicate the oval

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.520 
next I'm gonna do is duplicate the oval
thin<00:02:53.340> and<00:02:53.579> take<00:02:53.760> your<00:02:53.940> topmost<00:02:54.299> layer<00:02:54.540> hit<00:02:55.019> r1

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
thin and take your topmost layer hit r1

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.710 
thin and take your topmost layer hit r1
make<00:02:55.980> it<00:02:56.130> outline<00:02:56.549> and<00:02:56.819> go<00:02:57.360> to<00:02:57.420> a<00:02:57.480> lighter

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
make it outline and go to a lighter

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.960 
make it outline and go to a lighter
color<00:02:57.840> and<00:02:58.760> shrink<00:02:59.760> it<00:02:59.819> down<00:03:00.000> like<00:03:00.480> that<00:03:00.720> I

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
color and shrink it down like that I

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.640 
color and shrink it down like that I
actually<00:03:02.970> make<00:03:03.360> it<00:03:03.510> not<00:03:03.690> the<00:03:03.870> same<00:03:04.079> color<00:03:04.319> pink

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
actually make it not the same color pink

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.069 
actually make it not the same color pink
as<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:04.950> one<00:03:05.340> above<00:03:05.610> it<00:03:05.819> because<00:03:06.599> it's<00:03:06.900> on<00:03:07.049> a

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
as the one above it because it's on a

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:08.600 
as the one above it because it's on a
darker<00:03:07.440> background<00:03:07.590> and<00:03:08.069> it's<00:03:08.190> a<00:03:08.280> thin<00:03:08.579> line

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
darker background and it's a thin line

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.490 
darker background and it's a thin line
so<00:03:09.269> when<00:03:09.420> you're<00:03:09.569> zoomed<00:03:09.840> out<00:03:09.989> and<00:03:10.049> people<00:03:10.410> are

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
so when you're zoomed out and people are

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.720 
so when you're zoomed out and people are
looking<00:03:10.739> at<00:03:10.860> it<00:03:10.890> you<00:03:11.069> want<00:03:11.220> to<00:03:11.280> make<00:03:11.310> sure<00:03:11.430> that

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
looking at it you want to make sure that

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.000 
looking at it you want to make sure that
it<00:03:11.849> pops<00:03:12.390> and<00:03:12.690> it's<00:03:12.810> sharp<00:03:13.049> so<00:03:13.709> go<00:03:13.829> ahead<00:03:13.920> and

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
it pops and it's sharp so go ahead and

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.220 
it pops and it's sharp so go ahead and
do<00:03:14.160> that<00:03:14.190> so<00:03:14.760> I<00:03:14.790> make<00:03:15.000> that<00:03:15.180> oval<00:03:15.450> thin<00:03:15.660> next

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
do that so I make that oval thin next

make it the same dark purple so it
blends<00:04:23.669> in

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
blends in

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.810 
blends in

drop<00:04:26.940> it<00:04:27.150> below<00:04:27.750> your<00:04:27.900> oval<00:04:28.200> thend<00:04:28.440> and<00:04:29.040> then

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
drop it below your oval thend and then

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:30.890 
drop it below your oval thend and then
just<00:04:29.310> kind<00:04:29.460> of<00:04:29.520> tilt<00:04:30.060> it<00:04:30.270> so<00:04:30.480> that<00:04:30.630> it<00:04:30.720> looks

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900

just kind of tilt it so that it looks
like<00:04:31.080> it's<00:04:31.290> still<00:04:31.530> following<00:04:32.010> the<00:04:32.130> curve<00:04:32.400> of

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:32.670 
like it's still following the curve of

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:38.540 
like it's still following the curve of
of<00:04:33.420> that<00:04:34.280> there<00:04:35.280> you<00:04:35.340> go<00:04:35.520> just<00:04:36.240> like<00:04:36.330> that<00:04:37.550> next

is<00:05:04.439> kind<00:05:04.680> of<00:05:04.770> like<00:05:04.889> a<00:05:05.039> nub<00:05:05.490> you<00:05:05.849> know<00:05:06.090> what

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:06.449 
is kind of like a nub you know what

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:07.909 
is kind of like a nub you know what
instead<00:05:06.719> of<00:05:06.810> using<00:05:06.900> oval<00:05:07.319> medium<00:05:07.590> I<00:05:07.680> think<00:05:07.860> I

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 
instead of using oval medium I think I

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:10.010 
instead of using oval medium I think I
actually<00:05:08.129> used<00:05:08.460> an<00:05:08.580> oval<00:05:08.849> wide<00:05:09.029> so<00:05:09.749> use<00:05:09.900> an

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
actually used an oval wide so use an

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.830 
actually used an oval wide so use an
oval<00:05:10.229> wide<00:05:11.060> cuz<00:05:12.060> it's<00:05:12.180> actually<00:05:12.449> just<00:05:12.629> kind<00:05:12.810> of

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
oval wide cuz it's actually just kind of

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.149 
oval wide cuz it's actually just kind of
like<00:05:12.960> a<00:05:12.990> nub<00:05:14.419> there<00:05:15.419> you<00:05:15.479> go<00:05:15.629> just<00:05:15.870> like<00:05:16.020> that

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:16.159 
like a nub there you go just like that

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:18.709 
like a nub there you go just like that
shrink<00:05:17.159> it<00:05:17.279> down<00:05:17.430> until<00:05:17.789> it<00:05:17.969> covers<00:05:18.180> up<00:05:18.479> most

00:05:18.709 --> 00:05:18.719 
shrink it down until it covers up most

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:23.990 
shrink it down until it covers up most
of<00:05:18.870> the<00:05:18.960> garbage<00:05:22.069> there<00:05:23.069> you<00:05:23.189> go<00:05:23.340> just<00:05:23.819> like

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 
of the garbage there you go just like

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:31.999 
of the garbage there you go just like
that<00:05:24.680> more<00:05:25.680> or<00:05:26.240> less<00:05:29.750> there<00:05:30.750> we<00:05:30.870> go<00:05:30.990> and<00:05:31.289> the

which again is on page 8 this move is

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.610 
which again is on page 8 this move is
gonna<00:05:38.430> be<00:05:38.490> that<00:05:38.729> dark<00:05:39.150> purple<00:05:39.479> again<00:05:39.659> you're

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
gonna be that dark purple again you're

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.499 
gonna be that dark purple again you're
gonna<00:05:40.680> shrink<00:05:41.039> that<00:05:41.189> down<00:05:41.250> you're<00:05:42.210> gonna<00:05:42.300> have

it<00:05:42.599> kind<00:05:42.719> of<00:05:42.839> trace<00:05:43.080> the<00:05:43.229> contour<00:05:43.740> like<00:05:43.949> that

00:05:44.209 --> 00:05:44.219 
it kind of trace the contour like that

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:48.230 
it kind of trace the contour like that
of<00:05:45.120> that<00:05:45.360> top<00:05:45.629> now<00:05:45.990> see<00:05:46.379> that<00:05:46.969> but<00:05:47.969> then<00:05:48.089> what

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 
of that top now see that but then what

of that top now see that but then what
you're<00:05:48.330> gonna<00:05:48.389> do<00:05:48.659> is<00:05:49.080> drop<00:05:49.319> it<00:05:49.499> down<00:05:49.680> below

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:55.830 
to drop it down below everything like

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:00.140 
to drop it down below everything like
that<00:05:55.860> and<00:05:57.620> there<00:05:58.620> you<00:05:58.680> go<00:05:58.770> kind<00:05:59.009> of<00:05:59.159> does<00:06:00.029> the

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:01.889 
shadow and then you have one more layer

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:04.040 
shadow and then you have one more layer
left<00:06:02.219> if<00:06:02.969> you<00:06:03.120> want<00:06:03.330> to<00:06:03.509> you<00:06:03.689> could<00:06:03.870> add<00:06:04.020> a

left if you want to you could add a

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.529 
left if you want to you could add a
background<00:06:04.529> to<00:06:04.860> it<00:06:05.009> this<00:06:05.399> bell<00:06:05.669> works<00:06:06.060> best<00:06:06.330> on

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:06.539 
background to it this bell works best on

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:08.450 
background to it this bell works best on
dark<00:06:06.899> backgrounds<00:06:07.529> so<00:06:07.649> the<00:06:07.740> rainbow<00:06:08.099> is<00:06:08.219> good

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 
dark backgrounds so the rainbow is good

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:09.800 
dark backgrounds so the rainbow is good
some<00:06:08.759> of<00:06:08.789> the<00:06:08.909> other<00:06:09.029> backgrounds<00:06:09.569> are<00:06:09.689> good

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:09.810 
some of the other backgrounds are good

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:10.909 
some of the other backgrounds are good
but<00:06:09.960> it<00:06:10.050> wears<00:06:10.169> best<00:06:10.469> on<00:06:10.620> a<00:06:10.649> dark<00:06:10.889> background

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:10.919 
but it wears best on a dark background

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:12.290 
but it wears best on a dark background
if<00:06:11.370> you<00:06:11.430> really<00:06:11.789> don't<00:06:11.879> want<00:06:12.000> a<00:06:12.120> dark
