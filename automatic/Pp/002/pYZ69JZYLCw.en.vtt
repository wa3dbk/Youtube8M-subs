00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:18.260
 victory as you feel from the matches from 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:21.650
 Well I do not know the opponent is difficult about 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.510
 say well how would I think that in the second 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.700
 ti people during after ticket 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.520
 missed puck and maybe 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.180
 had already broken and the principle was ahead 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.190
 light 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:35.449
 on one side easy game strive 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:37.940
 do not allow and you are not the first 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:40.070
 match play in the link spectrum Tikhonov 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:44.030
 place in one sabashova how feel 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:47.140
 that mutual understanding is growing yes of course 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.850
 Viktor good case everyone knows these 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.340
 Basically everything was taken appears dodge 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.770
 but he had not scored sale not what you 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.969
 specifically brought to such moments 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.300
 so he scored and in the end 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:04.869
 turned out it was not so but if there 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:09.470
 moments it opens it always turns out 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:12.060
 if you still hurt with injury when you 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:15.210
 expect him to return 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.030
 I'm not a doctor, I hope the sooner 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.920
 better according to my information this press 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.840
 wrote that together with me I hope that 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.399
 average resistor worth believing below 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.399
 fasting home matches in a row is a lot 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:33.570
 good or bad well good for 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:36.000
 fans for start for us well think 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.090
 what but we collect 30 home match 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.500
 today in the end without a fight, if 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.720
 remember all the home squabbles 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.720
 some turned out to be the most difficult 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:51.180
 probably a big stir was around the match 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:53.780
 From CSKA what I think may be 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.070
 even somewhere through going around the array 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:00.080
 was psychologically difficult 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.080
 Well , shroud important dignity difficult
