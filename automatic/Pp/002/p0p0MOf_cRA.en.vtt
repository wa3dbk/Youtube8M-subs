00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:43.159 
into a magic resistance item while it
still<00:03:40.290> provides<00:03:40.530> a<00:03:40.889> shield<00:03:41.189> it's<00:03:41.489> only<00:03:42.030> 230<00:03:42.720> at

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:43.169 
still provides a shield it's only 230 at

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:45.710 
still provides a shield it's only 230 at
level<00:03:43.560> 18<00:03:44.069> and<00:03:44.340> it<00:03:44.579> requires<00:03:45.060> you<00:03:45.389> to<00:03:45.569> be

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
level 18 and it requires you to be

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.839 
level 18 and it requires you to be
rather<00:03:45.959> close<00:03:46.349> to<00:03:46.500> the<00:03:46.620> target<00:03:46.829> whereas<00:03:47.459> faces

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
rather close to the target whereas faces

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:49.460 
rather close to the target whereas faces
the<00:03:47.939> mountain<00:03:48.299> steadily<00:03:48.720> Fallon's<00:03:49.109> can<00:03:49.349> be

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
the mountain steadily Fallon's can be

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.920 
the mountain steadily Fallon's can be
targeted<00:03:49.849> not<00:03:50.849> only<00:03:51.030> that<00:03:51.150> the<00:03:51.569> shield<00:03:51.810> is

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
targeted not only that the shield is

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.020 
targeted not only that the shield is
actually<00:03:52.349> much<00:03:52.620> stronger<00:03:53.189> provided<00:03:53.849> you<00:03:54.000> have

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
actually much stronger provided you have

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.009 
actually much stronger provided you have
more<00:03:54.930> than<00:03:54.989> 2,300<00:03:55.829> HP<00:03:56.729> you'll<00:03:57.359> give<00:03:57.599> a<00:03:57.780> better

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
more than 2,300 HP you'll give a better

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:01.249 
more than 2,300 HP you'll give a better
shield<00:03:58.439> than<00:03:58.979> locket<00:03:59.519> so<00:03:59.849> overall<00:04:00.840> I<00:04:00.989> feel

00:04:01.249 --> 00:04:01.259 
shield than locket so overall I feel

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:02.719 
shield than locket so overall I feel
like<00:04:01.439> face<00:04:01.739> of<00:04:01.889> the<00:04:01.979> mountain<00:04:02.159> might<00:04:02.489> be<00:04:02.699> a

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:02.729 
like face of the mountain might be a

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:04.849 
like face of the mountain might be a
really<00:04:03.030> good<00:04:03.180> item<00:04:03.689> to<00:04:03.870> protect<00:04:04.259> from<00:04:04.500> single

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
really good item to protect from single

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:08.030 
really good item to protect from single
target<00:04:05.219> or<00:04:05.340> ad<00:04:06.000> burst<00:04:06.509> lock<00:04:07.290> it<00:04:07.469> does<00:04:07.709> have<00:04:07.889> its

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
target or ad burst lock it does have its

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.729 
target or ad burst lock it does have its
uses<00:04:08.250> but<00:04:08.459> i<00:04:08.729> think<00:04:09.150> it's<00:04:09.299> now<00:04:09.479> suited<00:04:10.199> towards

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
uses but i think it's now suited towards

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.309 
uses but i think it's now suited towards
handling<00:04:11.459> double<00:04:11.879> or<00:04:12.060> triple<00:04:12.299> AP<00:04:12.750> comp<00:04:12.989> say

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
handling double or triple AP comp say

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:16.129 
handling double or triple AP comp say
something<00:04:13.829> like<00:04:13.949> fiddle<00:04:14.669> sticks<00:04:14.969> and<00:04:15.209> zigs<00:04:15.569> so

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
something like fiddle sticks and zigs so

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:18.319 
something like fiddle sticks and zigs so
yeah<00:04:16.320> that's<00:04:16.530> all<00:04:16.919> for<00:04:17.190> today<00:04:17.489> I<00:04:17.699> hope<00:04:17.789> you
