down into it so if we take a Lex which
number<00:03:33.709> 10<00:03:33.919> plug<00:03:34.489> it<00:03:34.669> in<00:03:44.620> and<00:03:45.620> it'll<00:03:45.889> keep

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
number 10 plug it in and it'll keep

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:52.470 
number 10 plug it in and it'll keep
saying<00:03:46.370> that<00:03:46.519> and<00:03:46.579> so<00:03:46.790> you<00:03:46.909> press<00:03:47.090> the<00:03:47.239> button

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.520 

flipping<00:03:53.480> this<00:03:53.599> on<00:03:53.750> and<00:03:53.930> off<00:03:54.019> serves<00:03:54.379> no

flipping this on and off serves no

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.009 
flipping this on and off serves no
purpose<00:03:54.709> doesn't<00:03:55.099> really<00:03:55.340> do<00:03:55.519> anything<00:03:56.019> so

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
purpose doesn't really do anything so

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:58.210 
purpose doesn't really do anything so
Billy's<00:03:57.319> our<00:03:57.409> odds<00:03:57.560> pretty<00:03:57.769> fun<00:03:57.949> it's

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
Billy's our odds pretty fun it's

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.800 
Billy's our odds pretty fun it's
definitely<00:03:58.519> smaller<00:03:58.790> than<00:03:58.939> in<00:03:59.180> the<00:03:59.299> show<00:03:59.509> but

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
definitely smaller than in the show but

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.330 
definitely smaller than in the show but
of<00:03:59.870> course<00:04:00.079> this<00:04:00.259> is<00:04:00.409> made<00:04:00.590> more<00:04:00.859> for<00:04:01.099> kids

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
of course this is made more for kids

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.129 
of course this is made more for kids
hands<00:04:01.579> and<00:04:01.970> adult<00:04:02.180> hands<00:04:02.419> but<00:04:02.689> it<00:04:02.720> is<00:04:02.900> nice
