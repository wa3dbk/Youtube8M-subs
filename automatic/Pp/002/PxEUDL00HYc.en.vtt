00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:05.940
 then Anthony deepens this technique 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.950
 the hdl 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.960
 but before the solar aspects 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.550
 practice we first learned some 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.219
 theoretical concepts related to this 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.320
 technique as I told you this technique arises 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.940
 to bring the images that we have with 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.730
 our camera vision of the 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.220
 our eye for example is in the 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.350
 room of day and hours to the outside of 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.689
 sure that where you will perceive with a 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.330
 correct age group both inside the 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.199
 room with a landscape that is in the 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.200
 outdoor 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.180
 this is not possible without 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.390
 To be remembered we have already mentioned this when 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.610
 examined the issues raised by the 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.870
 dynamic range the problem in this case is 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.840
 precisely a problem of great 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.329
 dynamics with the digital sensor of our 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.309
 reflex albums cane this problem 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.350
 becomes even more visible only with 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.629
 movies had limitations that meanwhile 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.370
 could be resolved through the light 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.219
 fill using queue in some 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.170
 cases or a day of other forms or 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.699
 yet by the time it announced in getting 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.320
 an image that is coming closer 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.299
 human presence 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.790
 digital provides in the other 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.250
 techniques just allow us to 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.619
 able to get an image where all the 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.439
 tones are played back will require slow 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.080
 dynamic process for the human eye to 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.659
 me until a few years ago it was difficult to 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.600
 obtain a production on the monitor or 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.220
 least on an image printer that 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.140
 had a big difference from the 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.329
 brightness between the points of 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.850
 image the favorite sport and establish 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.250
 the limits of the dynamic range memories 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.799
 we already talked about this without the difference of 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.960
 position between the brightest points 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.759
 more courses within an image 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.890
 within a 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.960
 below to refer to the 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.880
 names the concept of great dynamics 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.930
 when we talk about the capabilities of our 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.670
 reflex 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.100
 we talk about the possibility of the sensor 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.079
 play a single shot the tops 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.939
 difference between points 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.189
 more curves and brighter points 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.170
 whereas if in the opposite 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.060
 referred to the monitor will be the 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.890
 to reproduce an image with different 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.280
 video brightness between points 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.069
 more clubs and more enlightened 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.989
 stole ours and has a capacity 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.800
 will interpret low and high 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.980
 bright 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.360
 and above all can understand 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.820
 simultaneously images with the strong 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.400
 lighting contrast or with 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:26.490
 high dynamic range and what is meant by 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.650
 Luminescence Baths Imminence Edition 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.350
 the intensity of a light source in 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.920
 relation to its mean surface 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.540
 understand them per square meter as well 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.980
 calls and generally looks to the 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.230
 that our ideas he can 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.930
 receive contrast images from 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.130
 illuminance up to 10 thousand ounces already 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.720
 difference 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.760
 the relationship between the points 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.130
 more enlightened minds and 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.230
 10 thousand for 1 considers that a monitor 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.790
 mid-range lcd can produce a 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.150
 image with an illuminance contrast 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:00.120
 Holy a dynamic range of at most 7 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.880
 61 and so there is a big difference 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.980
 between what we can see and the 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.870
 otherwise we are able to reproduce in the 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.610
 monitor because the picture is taken and 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.140
 printing on the print this value be 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.910
 even more so there is a large 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.790
 difference between what we get 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.070
 see and and what we are capable of 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.080
 producing 100 insight is precisely life 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.970
 this difficulty of producing images 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.190
 I think not only can you 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.170
 pressing awakening goes in the 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.750
 research and experimentation of 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.540
 new techniques and a galera in this 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:33.690
 susepe investigation is a lot of money and 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:36.540
 more than 710,000 yes actually the 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.910
 interest the commitment to this type of 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.500
 does not belong strictly to the 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.360
 to the world of photography 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.180
 but this is a technique that was born 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.550
 in other environments in the programmers 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.709
 of computer games to make more 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:52.170
 The scenarios also 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:54.420
 3d projection environments of leandro 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.270
 to make the brightness of your 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.400
 images as realistic as possible and 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:02.010
 designers of plasma screens 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.420
 and then lcd this technique so 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.850
 say now says in the world of photography 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.160
 with various adaptations to obtain the 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.360
 images that we will speak today consider that 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.489
 until today to produce images 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.580
 photographic formats were used in 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:16.410
 8 bits or even these media knows what 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.570
 I'm talking some depth of 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:21.419
 coura exactly whereas for this 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.850
 type of images for war has become 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:26.460
 necessary others to be formed and even 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.420
 32-bit color depth precisely 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.280
 to store water 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.690
 large amount of data that contains 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.760
 a destination image 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.550
 imagine that you already have this 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:38.130
 aspect or renato but post-production lessons 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:40.080
 yes yes we will deal with another aspect 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.510
 faithful reproduction of colors 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.190
 I think that during the graphic process 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.800
 we pass our images from a 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.750
 device for the other and to make 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.250
 was there the color production of the 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.160
 own image 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:56.400
 some graduates were standardized 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:58.620
 the format srv one of the formats the intention 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.020
 built in j prints the images that come out 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.760
 any reflex was born exactly this 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.490
 requirement to produce in the same way the 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.350
 images on a monitor or the same 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:10.290
 coming from a channel means oh 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:11.190
 sr gb stands for precisely standard 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.020
 rgb 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.730
 so all the images as we have with the 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.960
 our camera is ready 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:18.560
 for a professional athlete a 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:21.240
 device philosophy of the galley 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:24.180
 beat with salsa games have pictures 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:26.460
 that are not oriented to the correct 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.200
 playback on a device but for the 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.990
 correct representation of the real scene 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.940
 we are capturing and therefore we use the 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.520
 our device to receive the highest 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.900
 number of possible data but these 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.310
 should then be adapted to the new 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.230
 format that is not produced by the 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:42.060
 the transmitter is not after a phase of 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:44.570
 post-production which also comprises 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:47.220
 of such mapping that makes it predictable 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:49.230
 apparent there all this talk to 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.120
 hundreds of difference enters the images 

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:53.730
 device- oriented 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.920
 justify refers to and vice versa 

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:59.280
 are oriented to the scene uses scenes 

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:01.170
 seven hours all major step 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.750
 the world of photography and I would like to 

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:05.340
 really be the same about the 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:08.610
 team that will be in English 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:15.800
 So call if you're going up. 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:18.570
 Wifford then repeats teaching and strong 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:20.940
 anyway we talk about the future was 

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:22.860
 then the images of various reinforcements are 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.510
 those account inside all 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.340
 data necessary to correct the 

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:29.340
 on the device 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:31.530
 ok whether on a digital reflex camera 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:33.990
 wants peace in the monitor at all stages of the 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:36.690
 process while the images are in the 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:38.550
 referenced to the scene contains 

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:40.889
 all data related to the scene 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:42.749
 that was captured 

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:44.340
 there are all the data of the Fluminense 

00:06:42.749 --> 00:06:46.530
 referring to that scene this type of 

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:48.509
 surprise image in a ram chain and 

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:50.819
 What are the formats for war? 

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:52.560
 repairs in the experimental phase appear 

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:53.819
 many formats appeared but later 

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:56.400
 were imposed as standard 

00:06:53.819 --> 00:06:59.039
 mainly two of these which are the 

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:01.830
 radiance to realize that it is indicated by 

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:03.960
 extension of the point the gang and the pan e xr 

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:06.569
 which indicates its tip extension is to make 

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:07.879
 I was but now with renato as is the 

00:07:06.569 --> 00:07:11.189
 English 

00:07:07.879 --> 00:07:13.939
 You realize a lot of photography but 

00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:13.939
 of English
