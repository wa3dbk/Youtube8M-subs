so<00:01:57.000> there's<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.420> front<00:01:58.040> then<00:01:59.040> you're<00:01:59.490> going

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
so there's the front then you're going

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.640 
so there's the front then you're going
to<00:01:59.670> want<00:01:59.820> to<00:01:59.909> go<00:01:59.970> ahead<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.540> pull<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.440> little

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
knotted edge through the center like

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.370 
knotted edge through the center like
that<00:02:07.440> and<00:02:08.539> then<00:02:09.539> you're<00:02:09.720> going<00:02:09.810> to<00:02:09.869> wrap<00:02:10.080> the

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.920 
that and then you're going to wrap the
wire<00:02:10.590> around<00:02:12.050> the<00:02:13.050> bottom<00:02:13.380> and<00:02:14.750> just<00:02:15.750> keep

wire around the bottom and just keep

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.720 
wire around the bottom and just keep
wrapping<00:02:16.410> keep<00:02:16.620> wrapping<00:02:17.040> so<00:02:17.220> it<00:02:17.340> gets<00:02:17.430> really

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
wrapping keep wrapping so it gets really

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.090 
wrapping keep wrapping so it gets really
tight<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:18.330> it<00:02:18.540> creates<00:02:18.930> it<00:02:19.110> kind<00:02:19.290> of<00:02:19.350> pulls<00:02:19.890> it

tight and it creates it kind of pulls it
through<00:02:20.130> the<00:02:20.400> middle<00:02:21.200> so<00:02:22.200> it<00:02:22.230> creates<00:02:22.709> that

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
through the middle so it creates that

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.990 
through the middle so it creates that
fullness<00:02:23.670> effect<00:02:24.180> as<00:02:24.360> if<00:02:24.510> it<00:02:24.660> was<00:02:24.810> a<00:02:24.840> flower<00:02:26.000> so

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
fullness effect as if it was a flower so

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
