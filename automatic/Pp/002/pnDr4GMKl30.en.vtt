00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.600
 and girls and today asked for a recipe 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.189
 very easy and it 's a lemon cake 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.440
 I 've already made a model myself 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.389
 so if I can get anyone going 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.490
 To get more in the video I asked for my 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.800
 to record 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.230
 So you'll need to do this 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.289
 cake of a goal of those of sachet of 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.180
 lemon can be any marks a 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:28.230
 lemon gelatin can be any 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:31.230
 also brand a can of milk 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.649
 The condensate can also be any 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.660
 brand including ps that is even cheaper 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:42.329
 a glass of natural yogurt has to 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:44.730
 be natural not cleared three eggs and 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.250
 you will also need oil that 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:52.020
 Are you going to measure a little glass of that? 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:55.260
 yogurt and also a lemon and mail to 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.320
 squeeze to make the cover after 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.420
 well then it's the next you're just gonna 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.199
 mixing all the ingredients in the 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.869
 blender and in case and my mother she 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.420
 put it all at once like this 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.100
 then hit because the blender that 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.330
 he's here at home he can beat it like that 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.280
 the mass even if it stays a little 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.860
 It's a bit heavier but she does not 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.450
 heavy but has some blender that 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.530
 sometimes it does not hit very well 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.810
 cake 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.650
 so if it is the case the equator does not hit 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.689
 very well 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.520
 cake batter you can use mixer 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.140
 that's okay too 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.930
 or else you put first 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.960
 most liquid ingredients there was no 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:37.730
 the oil everything else goes after 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.730
 beating down what powder 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:49.810
 So like I told you, the oil is 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:52.810
 a cup of yogurt and after you 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.510
 to beat everything, just one passenger and put 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:59.470
 to pass I put it in the oven 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:01.390
 preheated to 180 degrees and then 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.310
 while the steel cake is only to make 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.520
 cover that is a can of milk 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.520
 condensed 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:14.740
 you put the whole can and put 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:17.170
 gradually stirring the lemon juice 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.730
 and then you have to do this well 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.270
 coverage because she has already come 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.220
 giving a funny and then you go 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.709
 reserve this cover in the refrigerator until 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.120
 the cake has finished and it has cooled 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.320
 so it will stay a bit longer 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.320
 Thick at the time of putting 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:50.100
 so the cake after baking it stays 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:52.530
 so it looks good inside and there 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.510
 after the cake is already roasted in the 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.300
 flower garden half after it has cooled 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.550
 and the cover stayed so look how she 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.830
 ever given a thickened but after 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.380
 puts on the cake went to the refrigerator goes 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.260
 to thicken a little more 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.390
 so then just get this coverage 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.010
 spreading over and around the cake 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.040
 it will run a little bit down into the 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:18.180
 Pratinho is all the coverage ends up falling 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.740
 a little but it's just spreading without 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.300
 secrets just put in the way that 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.300
 want and then take to the refrigerator 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.340
 Then after you take the cake to the refrigerator. 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.680
 to harden a little more 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.319
 coverage is not hard it just got a 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.299
 little more so, then the 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.250
 I cut the cake to show you 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:11.069
 because it looks really cool inside the 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.989
 green season 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:17.209
 Look how fine he looks blue by 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:17.209
 inside is cool to show and cut already 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:29.350
 and then I forgot to put it first if 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:32.560
 You want you can put shavings on the 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:34.750
 lemon peel and top it to give a 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.340
 taste and also to decorate the 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.220
 I had forgotten so I put 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.880
 after you have already cut the cake but not 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:44.410
 It's a problem, but actually, to be good. 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.630
 just drag a little of the 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:48.850
 can you leave in the white part, right? 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:52.710
 lemon in green passport bottles 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.710
 do not get bitter 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:03.420
 well then in the end the cake stayed like this 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:05.910
 I thought he looked pretty cute or 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.680
 so this is the recipe girl I hope 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.020
