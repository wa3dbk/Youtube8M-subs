00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.470 
know seemingly everyone had changed but

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:33.090 
know seemingly everyone had changed but
I<00:05:29.620> was<00:05:29.800> the<00:05:29.949> kind<00:05:30.100> of<00:05:30.250> one<00:05:30.840> fact<00:05:31.840> one<00:05:32.440> element

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:33.100 
I was the kind of one fact one element

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.860 
I was the kind of one fact one element
that<00:05:33.220> had<00:05:33.639> remained<00:05:33.820> the<00:05:34.120> same<00:05:34.330> and<00:05:34.600> I<00:05:34.630> thought

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870 
that had remained the same and I thought

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.680 
that had remained the same and I thought
well<00:05:35.199> this<00:05:35.680> feels<00:05:35.919> like<00:05:36.070> a<00:05:36.190> new<00:05:36.490> club<00:05:37.360> a<00:05:37.389> new

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:37.690 
well this feels like a new club a new

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:39.480 
well this feels like a new club a new
era<00:05:37.900> to<00:05:38.169> me<00:05:38.260> you<00:05:38.440> know<00:05:38.560> I<00:05:38.770> don't<00:05:39.190> necessarily

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
era to me you know I don't necessarily

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.610 
era to me you know I don't necessarily
believe<00:05:40.300> I<00:05:40.540> belong<00:05:40.900> here<00:05:41.050> anymore

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
believe I belong here anymore

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.710 
believe I belong here anymore
so<00:05:42.400> it<00:05:42.490> just<00:05:42.610> prompted<00:05:43.120> the<00:05:43.210> decision<00:05:43.330> I'd

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
so it just prompted the decision I'd

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.870 
so it just prompted the decision I'd
already<00:05:43.900> been<00:05:44.139> asked<00:05:44.500> by<00:05:44.680> other<00:05:45.250> clubs<00:05:45.580> during
