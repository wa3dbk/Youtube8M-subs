 Hello everyone today, we want to Katia 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.379
 miner's profession 

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:10.110
 directly about him and his subjects well 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.940
 and that in general he represents himself begin 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.790
 from having that profession by many 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:18.300
 20 level of destruction and what to choose 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:22.100
 profession from professions so let's say 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.660
 estimate the spawn to come up to bear the miner 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.789
 click on it and click on select 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.060
 profession 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:33.360
 what can itself though 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.550
 professions he has lava damage reduced by 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.640
 50 percent if 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.210
 if you wear miner's armor, that is 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.960
 i am now 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:47.539
 swearing by a miner or simply not 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:50.070
 bathe bathe bathe bathe not 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:52.590
 barely subtracted and one unit 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.600
 Health, that is, you drink it fast 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.960
 stop burning when you exit 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.859
 fame further he pulls down blocking you 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:07.970
 percent faster even usually pick something 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.970
 there is a diamond usually with a diamond pick here 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:17.130
 he has a chance to extract ore from simple 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:20.310
 stone that is to knock out of ordinary stone 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.180
 or iron or gold or behold the round 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.570
 diamond ore 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.270
 that is, questions do not just do not break it 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.750
 a stone can fall out of it 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.140
 fall out 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:36.390
 any ore or just stone again 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:38.400
 same coal or just coal he has 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:43.500
 your craft rights 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:49.220
 it is steel that is crafted from one 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:51.119
 coal one iron 1 coal and firewood glory 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.600
 when you take steel 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:59.670
 the bucket is back but already empty 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:04.610
 he has kraft silicon is flint 2 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.610
 sand and one flint and two more squeak 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:14.980
 let's start about its features 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:19.930
 naturally must begin with drill drill 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:22.510
 We crafted by an engineer like Cass and 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.239
 as well as a mining helmet by the way about 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.790
 who forgot to tell you 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:30.670
 whose sight in the dark directly 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.129
 let's talk more about armor 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.590
 miner 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:40.000
 it is 43 times superior in strength 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:43.060
 diamond armor can be crafted 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.239
 a player other than a helmet can be crafted 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.519
 would the player be everything except a helmet having steel and 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:51.040
 gold 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:53.049
 continue disputes let's start with 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.700
 the first bureau of the drill number one is crafting 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:56.680
 so the drill is taken which 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:01.230
 karate engineer and put amazo in 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:05.799
 that order got was number one 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:08.739
 bar number one breaks us stone here 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:15.840
 this way one in the middle 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:15.840
 one left 1 right approach stripping 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:24.650
 further bar number two nozzle with us 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:31.010
 It looks here and so here too smeary 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:31.519
 bureau number two he breaks down the middle in 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:36.230
 three blocks 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:41.930
 that is, take once in my 3 next 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:43.640
 drill number 30 drill he craft us here 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.640
 so why love because it requires 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:49.400
 firstly less diamond secondly well 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.480
 just like to use it breaks straight 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:57.769
 one in the middle one in the top one in the bottom 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:59.890
 approach for cleaning the area well and 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:05.720
 of course the last bar number 4 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:10.340
 crafting so it breaks with us 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:14.959
 four blocks it now we are in such 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:16.850
 cleaner place here now show here 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:20.229
 here here at this distance we take 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.979
 we put in the middle that is you see 12 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:25.190
 goes to the middle 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:27.020
 one on the left 1 on the right one on top for someone 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:30.580
 I like someone I do not like but I am river 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.580
 I use only to search for diamonds 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.389
 further from while i'm breaking me already 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.850
 fell iron gold 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:40.550
 diamond kind of what he was talking small 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.000
 drone shot drop chance out of the ordinary 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:47.260
 stone 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:50.270
 the ore is farther at the miner there is a radar radar 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:54.560
 allows you to find in the nearest 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:57.289
 location any ore it may 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.789
 be either diamond or gold or 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:00.590
 iron lilu the visuals what he 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:05.690
 says let's see push the truth reed 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:07.880
 and we are watching here at a distance of 8 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:10.430
 blocks i.e. it can be 8 right 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:15.260
 eight back eight by eight to the right and 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:18.200
 at a height of 12 to 2 will appoint 12 higher 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:21.190
 if it was minus means news -12 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:25.090
 go minus 12 down 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:27.960
 is the gold ore diamond ward 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:30.160
 we are located at a distance of 1 that is 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:34.390
 right to left 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:40.920
 or down and at a height of 5 let's try 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:50.100
 unite so we take a foursome my power 

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:55.030
 right so here it is 5 so time two three 4 5 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:56.940
 we break here especially from around here 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:59.290
 Diamond ore 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.970
 that is, I recommend the profession for 

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:02.590
 newbies 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:05.560
 firstly because it is easier for them to swing 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:06.940
 second destruction is easiest for them 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:10.060
 get rich with resources 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:16.570
 Well, in the third even just to 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:18.730
 so that for the profession of a thief you need to have 21 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:19.780
 level or destruction or construction that 

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:22.420
 turn into a blog 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:23.680
 many take for some reason the thief immediately east 

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:30.010
 got level 20 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:32.500
 and its meaning is that meaning 

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:34.290
 is that he can 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:36.490
 turn into a blog 

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:39.010
 well and for naturally in order 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:45.040
 Union needs to have level 22 destruction 

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:48.700
 what to withstand 2 2 arms shield ie 2 

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:51.480
 never hurt everyone thanks to play 

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.480
 im play galaxy
