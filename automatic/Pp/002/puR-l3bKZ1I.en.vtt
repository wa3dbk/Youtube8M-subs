00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.490
 the chair for a tennis player 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:17.810
 wheelchair are your sneakers is 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.180
 say if we go with the shoe 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.250
 big or skating or that does not fit 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.960
 well the most normal thing is that we do not play 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.960
 well and that we can have injuries 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.780
 in the chair you have that I'm using 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.320
 right now and I'm too small 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:37.110
 I need a wheelchair more to my 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.220
 measure and with larger wheels radio 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.290
 also growing on the wheels 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.120
 they are low for the back but on 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.950
 everything ends too much since the year 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.420
 past it was already dragging problems in 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.969
 arm 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.469
 biceps and triceps what is important 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.989
 understand of all this is that it is a 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.430
 tool as the racket can be 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.960
 federer can not be a racket that 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.949
 let's go and buy in a supermarket 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.949
 it has to be something different 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.290
 the chairs are the measures that is 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.890
 made of titanium from another material more 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:08.409
 lightweight wheels are angled to 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.690
 that turns better and then has a wheel 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:12.729
 anti-roll that wheelchairs 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.409
 normal do not have that's so in the 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.490
 looting when we lean back 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:17.490
 let's not fall back 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:25.689
 your tool of work within the 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.579
 sport is the chair and what we 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:30.490
 we had realized is that because the 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:32.350
 old chairs that old inversis is 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.329
 puts in front of an initiative with its 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.310
 employees with customers to be able to 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:38.259
 give an answer to that need and what 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.719
 what we have done is try to look for it 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:42.459
 try to give him a new chair that will 

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:44.950
 So let's face your next challenges 

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:48.539
 sports with total guarantee that stops 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.539
 a guy like him, it's not going to be difficult
