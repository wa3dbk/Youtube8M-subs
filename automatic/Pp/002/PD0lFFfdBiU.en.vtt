as you can see here I have the monitor

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.370 
as you can see here I have the monitor
self<00:03:07.280> is<00:03:07.489> 24<00:03:08.000> inches<00:03:08.390> obviously<00:03:08.930> and<00:03:09.140> it's<00:03:09.320> a

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
self is 24 inches obviously and it's a

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.199 
self is 24 inches obviously and it's a
perfect<00:03:09.890> fit<00:03:10.250> between<00:03:10.459> all<00:03:11.000> of<00:03:11.030> these

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
perfect fit between all of these

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.509 
perfect fit between all of these
speakers<00:03:11.720> actually<00:03:12.590> just<00:03:12.769> like<00:03:12.830> a<00:03:12.890> little<00:03:13.370> bit

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
speakers actually just like a little bit

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:16.690 
speakers actually just like a little bit
of<00:03:13.550> space<00:03:13.880> left<00:03:14.450> for<00:03:15.190> anything<00:03:16.190> else<00:03:16.550> I<00:03:16.610> don't

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
the Samsung sync master s4b 308 I have

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.430 
the Samsung sync master s4b 308 I have
my<00:04:23.470> Microsoft<00:04:23.889> webcam<00:04:24.340> here<00:04:24.669> I<00:04:24.699> have<00:04:25.030> and<00:04:25.750> I

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
my Microsoft webcam here I have and I

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.409 
my Microsoft webcam here I have and I
have<00:04:26.560> two<00:04:26.770> three<00:04:27.340> speakers<00:04:27.669> surrounding<00:04:28.300> the

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 
have two three speakers surrounding the

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:30.210 
have two three speakers surrounding the
screen<00:04:28.690> and<00:04:28.870> it's<00:04:28.990> like<00:04:29.139> a<00:04:29.169> perfect<00:04:29.470> fit<00:04:29.919> you

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
screen and it's like a perfect fit you

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.589 
screen and it's like a perfect fit you
can<00:04:30.430> see<00:04:30.669> this<00:04:30.849> like<00:04:31.090> just<00:04:31.449> enough<00:04:31.810> room<00:04:32.130> and

00:04:33.589 --> 00:04:33.599 
can see this like just enough room and

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:35.909 
can see this like just enough room and
but<00:04:34.599> the<00:04:34.690> only<00:04:34.810> bad<00:04:35.020> thing<00:04:35.320> I<00:04:35.440> think<00:04:35.470> that's

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 
but the only bad thing I think that's

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:38.219 
but the only bad thing I think that's
about<00:04:36.370> this<00:04:36.639> monitor<00:04:37.330> is<00:04:37.360> a<00:04:37.509> combi<00:04:37.870> mounting

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:38.229 
about this monitor is a combi mounting

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:40.560 
about this monitor is a combi mounting
so<00:04:38.440> that's<00:04:38.620> pretty<00:04:38.860> lame<00:04:39.280> and<00:04:39.789> if<00:04:40.180> you<00:04:40.240> can<00:04:40.360> see

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
so that's pretty lame and if you can see

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:55.389 
the power source for my hard drive

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:57.960 
the power source for my hard drive
wasn't<00:04:55.599> connected<00:04:56.139> and<00:04:56.340> I<00:04:57.340> switch<00:04:57.729> on<00:04:57.849> the

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
wasn't connected and I switch on the

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.860 
wasn't connected and I switch on the
computer<00:04:58.090> thing<00:04:58.750> and<00:04:59.020> I<00:04:59.530> didn't<00:05:00.460> knows

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
computer thing and I didn't knows

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.260 
computer thing and I didn't knows
disconnected<00:05:01.870> so<00:05:02.669> when<00:05:03.669> I<00:05:03.699> did<00:05:03.909> plug<00:05:04.120> it<00:05:04.240> back

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
disconnected so when I did plug it back

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.750 
disconnected so when I did plug it back
in<00:05:04.630> in<00:05:05.139> something<00:05:06.010> interfere<00:05:06.460> with<00:05:06.669> the

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
in in something interfere with the

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.250 
in in something interfere with the
screen<00:05:07.060> and<00:05:07.360> then<00:05:07.449> the<00:05:07.570> screen<00:05:07.750> switched<00:05:08.050> off

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
screen and then the screen switched off

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:09.719 
screen and then the screen switched off
and<00:05:08.409> stuff<00:05:08.590> out<00:05:08.770> I<00:05:08.979> don't<00:05:09.250> know<00:05:09.400> what<00:05:09.460> the<00:05:09.639> hell

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:09.729 
and stuff out I don't know what the hell

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:11.510 
and stuff out I don't know what the hell
happened<00:05:09.849> but<00:05:10.210> yeah<00:05:10.630> something<00:05:11.169> did<00:05:11.289> happen

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
happened but yeah something did happen

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.370 
happened but yeah something did happen
obviously<00:05:12.520> you<00:05:12.849> have<00:05:12.970> your<00:05:13.000> touch<00:05:13.419> keys<00:05:14.169> at

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
obviously you have your touch keys at

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:15.839 
obviously you have your touch keys at
the<00:05:14.409> bottom<00:05:14.500> so<00:05:14.949> you<00:05:15.039> have<00:05:15.159> yourself<00:05:15.610> and

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:15.849 
the bottom so you have yourself and

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:17.730 
the bottom so you have yourself and
stuff<00:05:16.090> for<00:05:16.240> that<00:05:16.360> and<00:05:16.840> you<00:05:17.169> can<00:05:17.289> have<00:05:17.320> like<00:05:17.530> the

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
stuff for that and you can have like the

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.320 
stuff for that and you can have like the
angles<00:05:18.159> and<00:05:18.340> stuff<00:05:18.460> I<00:05:18.699> don't<00:05:18.880> know<00:05:18.940> if<00:05:19.060> it<00:05:19.180> can

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
angles and stuff I don't know if it can

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:20.820 
angles and stuff I don't know if it can
tell<00:05:19.599> that's<00:05:19.780> the<00:05:19.930> only<00:05:20.199> thing<00:05:20.409> is<00:05:20.590> a<00:05:20.620> bit

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
tell that's the only thing is a bit

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.700 
tell that's the only thing is a bit
weird<00:05:21.130> that<00:05:21.370> it<00:05:22.120> caught<00:05:22.449> I<00:05:22.780> can't<00:05:23.289> really<00:05:23.590> move

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
weird that it caught I can't really move

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.830 
weird that it caught I can't really move
anything<00:05:24.039> but<00:05:24.310> you<00:05:24.370> can<00:05:24.550> solve<00:05:25.270> everything<00:05:25.570> I

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 
anything but you can solve everything I

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:26.399 
anything but you can solve everything I
can<00:05:26.020> do

00:05:26.399 --> 00:05:26.409 
can do

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:30.930 
can do
brightness<00:05:27.280> and<00:05:27.460> contrast<00:05:27.639> that<00:05:29.699> I<00:05:30.699> might

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:30.940 
brightness and contrast that I might

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.230 
brightness and contrast that I might
really<00:05:31.210> heal<00:05:31.750> so<00:05:32.229> well<00:05:32.770> no<00:05:32.919> I<00:05:32.949> am<00:05:33.340> low<00:05:33.610> de<00:05:33.820> vive

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240 
really heal so well no I am low de vive

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.560 
really heal so well no I am low de vive
so

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:38.570 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:41.090 

they<00:05:39.570> obviously<00:05:39.690> have<00:05:39.960> the<00:05:40.110> angle<00:05:40.470> think<00:05:40.770> and

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.100 
they obviously have the angle think and

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:46.850 
they obviously have the angle think and
then<00:05:41.220> your<00:05:41.430> bright<00:05:43.100> samsung<00:05:44.100> magicangle<00:05:45.860> so

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
then your bright samsung magicangle so

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.930 
then your bright samsung magicangle so
you<00:05:46.920> have<00:05:47.070> that<00:05:47.190> the<00:05:47.370> different<00:05:47.670> colors

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:49.940 
you have that the different colors

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:57.550 
you have that the different colors
actually<00:05:50.940> don't<00:05:51.270> like<00:05:51.420> I<00:05:51.570> don't<00:05:51.750> mind

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.560 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.950
