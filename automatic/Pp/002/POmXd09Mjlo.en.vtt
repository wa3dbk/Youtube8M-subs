 hi hi everyone his phrases x 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.040
 we find ourselves today for a 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.839
 little video presentation of the xbox one 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.910
 I made a small presentation of the 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.980
 ps4 so here it's going to be the same kind of 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.139
 video I introduced you with what the 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.350
 books and the little benefits the 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.940
 small defects we kill already ben there 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.390
 the two-sleeve example of buying them 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.910
 with the crazy high tone pact this pack 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.820
 Well, it's like we had 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.699
 free title since xbox one and 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.850
 costs 499 euros and the pact is a 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.079
 madness this box one costs 499 euros the 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.440
 ton cooked foie gras it's pretty good 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:41.309
 and in the package is she crazy with 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.570
 the former boxer we have this is stop the game 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.260
 with a crazy but in there is not the 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.989
 game it's a flashcode so in fact it 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.550
 must flash with kawawii kinect 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.219
 good as I wanted 10 comes with 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.230
 the kinect a link tell you so the 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.739
 kinect it's this fault to an advantage 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:03.539
 beyond the xbox 360 and even the one to 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:05.220
 the detection movements of kinect 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.850
 texans voice age who too much how they say 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.720
 that's really good 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.450
 I think it's a good little 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.180
 point for for the xbox one will be after 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.060
 engaged with his books with 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.100
 hdmi cable for those of those on it has 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.770
 nothing exceptional either and a cable 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.509
 hdmi like as in the ps4 has matured and 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.479
 no it's not totally itself the 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:33.540
 flap and bigger bigger it's not going too 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:36.689
 interested so otherwise it comes with the 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.369
 hard disk of the xbox onekey which is 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.500
 big who is not in xbox saw 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.119
 his had the head of the xbox to put a 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.329
 hard drive in addition to stop in 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.740
 monster so the hard drive but me this 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.570
 that I will explain a little 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.680
 how to connect some boots and 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.020
 that I really struggled that the 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.049
 dictatorships plug his or what I'm 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.829
 I said in fact that's how ah 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:01.229
 to say that is the catch for for the 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:05.040
 power cable and I told myself 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:09.509
 but then yes for taking for 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:12.330
 connect to how much flip to the power strip 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:15.360
 I told myself she and August you 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:20.760
 and after I saw that there was this is in 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:23.970
 does that then it gets put here and then with 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:27.780
 his too much linked to his threat is taking book 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:31.620
 like that there is the hard drive directly 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.330
 connected to the console and and the hard drive 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.830
 it connects the power cables too 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.070
 at the console so it went well 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.570
 also by the developers well here you go 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.380
 here 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:46.020
 so after if you have a little headphones 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:48.480
 which comes with this xbox one but 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.070
 that's after if if you find how 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.530
 plug newts stuff like that 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:55.170
 it not serve you too but good 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.640
 here it is good enough it's better than 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.200
 the ps4 since the little quest for peace 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.250
 this quarter unfolding terrible 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.320
 the instinct cascua otherwise we attach 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.990
 hammamet a good hand but you know 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.910
 it is necessary that there is one in suede 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:11.640
 are the joystick she's really 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:14.340
 really very very well taken in hand 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.440
 she is very ugly she is very very 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.700
 well think that the left hand when we 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.739
 takes a joystick in the direct left hand 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.940
 on the Gothic right hand as good 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.120
 there I can not show you what with what 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.730
 I hold my iphone my heart is 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.709
 it's even the team we had 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.360
 directly on the rear joystick 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.459
 when transmits like that for the joystick 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.130
 before you need a bit of progress but nothing 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:37.019
 at all it's really good and for me 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.269
 who did not have the 360 was very very 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:41.670
 very easy to adapt to the at the 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:43.350
 xbox one controller have no idea 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:48.330
 why but it was easy to 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:50.250
 adapt me so with this microphone I 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.739
 did not tell you where to plug it in and ben 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.310
 it's very simple see the microphone 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:58.019
 the tip of the microphone and like that and there y'a 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:00.750
 little things and we find his 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:02.850
 little ones his grandchildren this is this 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:11.700
 little slot here it will connect the 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:13.920
 microphone la the alas the microphone is 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.239
 plugged in just have to press there and that 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.340
 not at all embarrassed even in taking in 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:19.109
 hand see you do not touch you here I am 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.669
 can not do it and my right hand but we 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.660
 will touch at all so that's really 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:26.120
 well after on the xbox one 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.130
 so I wanted good then I'll go 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:32.420
 to say a little the catch what's the point and 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:34.130
 all so we got it we have to slot for 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:36.370
 the games so good there as in all 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:40.490
 the consoles it takes a slot 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:43.100
 there we have the little button to light 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.750
 the xbox it is tactile like the ps4 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.090
 mulas and the infanta there was a 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:50.600
 Slot at the ps4 weary touch too 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:52.040
 his sister pissed on it that's nothing then 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.200
 there we have the big big big fan 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.790
 it is huge aulas you can paint 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.400
 through my words I struggle to see 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:00.590
 through but it is very very very big 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:05.720
 so here six they showed from behind 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:08.390
 also so behind it we took it for 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:11.300
 connect the power cable on to the 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:15.230
 socket for connecting the cable HDMI TV 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:18.620
 greet the TV on TV what we've got 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:22.750
 ipf lab no idea what these sdf 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:26.390
 there was the HDMI HDMI jack to connect 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:29.780
 to satellite cable satellite cable sat 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:31.090
 framework I never knew anything 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:34.250
 plug it in so I do not know too much 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:37.400
 after here it's good to leave the two 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:39.950
 and defend to connect the pickups the 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.600
 loads re that's what then there I know 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:43.490
 not if you see the little logo but there 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.080
 we have here it is the kinect and here it is the 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:50.450
 small tip can connect to kinect 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:53.530
 the tip of the kinect is enough 

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:58.220
 weird but this branch is getting confused 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:06:01.280
 here it is plugged in after that we have a 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:04.370
 little thing with a little point is ire 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:06.050

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.280
