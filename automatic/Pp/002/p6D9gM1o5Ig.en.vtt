00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
it's really cool it's really fine so we

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:14.570 
it's really cool it's really fine so we
get<00:00:13.950> started<00:00:14.309> right<00:00:14.400> away

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
get started right away

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:15.950 
get started right away
okay<00:00:14.820> let's<00:00:15.000> do<00:00:15.120> it<00:00:15.150> first<00:00:15.540> of<00:00:15.690> all<00:00:15.780> what<00:00:15.929> you

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
okay let's do it first of all what you

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.750 
okay let's do it first of all what you
want<00:00:16.080> to<00:00:16.230> do<00:00:16.320> is<00:00:16.410> you<00:00:16.500> want<00:00:16.650> to<00:00:16.680> carve<00:00:16.980> a<00:00:17.250> master

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
want to do is you want to carve a master

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.460 
want to do is you want to carve a master
frame<00:00:18.029> or<00:00:18.300> anything<00:00:18.750> else<00:00:18.990> that<00:00:19.140> you<00:00:19.260> want<00:00:19.410> to

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
frame or anything else that you want to

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.040 
frame or anything else that you want to
cast<00:00:19.680> in<00:00:19.949> a<00:00:20.490> rigid<00:00:20.789> material<00:00:21.240> like<00:00:21.390> wax<00:00:21.600> wood

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
cast in a rigid material like wax wood

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.840 
cast in a rigid material like wax wood
something<00:00:22.890> can<00:00:23.010> something<00:00:23.519> that<00:00:23.550> can<00:00:23.730> take

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
something can something that can take

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.609 
something can something that can take
some<00:00:24.029> pressure<00:00:24.210> being<00:00:24.600> pushed<00:00:24.960> into<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.380> sand

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
some pressure being pushed into the sand

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.830 
some pressure being pushed into the sand
okay<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.490> it<00:00:26.609> has<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:26.880> be<00:00:27.000> divisible<00:00:27.269> by<00:00:27.510> two

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
okay and it has to be divisible by two

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.509 
okay and it has to be divisible by two
right<00:00:28.109> right<00:00:28.470> right<00:00:28.529> so<00:00:28.890> you<00:00:28.980> can<00:00:29.099> pull<00:00:29.279> two

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
right right right so you can pull two

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.370 
right right right so you can pull two
halves<00:00:29.789> of<00:00:30.000> something<00:00:30.330> apart<00:00:30.660> you<00:00:31.109> know<00:00:31.230> get

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
halves of something apart you know get

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.020 
halves of something apart you know get
that<00:00:31.500> we'll<00:00:31.740> explain<00:00:32.040> that<00:00:32.099> later<00:00:32.340> yeah<00:00:32.610> right

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
that we'll explain that later yeah right

little bit larger but you can make your
own<00:01:23.159> mold<00:01:23.430> frame<00:01:23.640> oh<00:01:23.820> I<00:01:24.180> know<00:01:24.780> some<00:01:25.049> people

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
own mold frame oh I know some people

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.280 
own mold frame oh I know some people
that<00:01:25.380> use<00:01:25.590> tuna<00:01:25.979> cans<00:01:26.189> oh<00:01:26.460> good<00:01:26.820> idea<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.290> it

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
that use tuna cans oh good idea and it

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.010 
that use tuna cans oh good idea and it
works<00:01:28.470> out<00:01:28.560> really<00:01:28.770> well<00:01:29.810> so<00:01:30.810> what<00:01:30.930> you're

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
works out really well so what you're

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.969 
works out really well so what you're
going<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.170> do<00:01:31.259> now<00:01:31.409> is<00:01:31.530> you're<00:01:31.619> going<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.799> take

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
going to do now is you're going to take

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.330 
going to do now is you're going to take
this<00:01:32.189> your<00:01:32.790> master<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.420> push<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:33.720> in<00:01:33.810> there

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
this your master and push it in there

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.039 
this your master and push it in there
and<00:01:35.340> so<00:01:35.579> this<00:01:35.939> is<00:01:36.090> why<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.329> needs<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.689> be<00:01:36.960> able

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
and so this is why it needs to be able

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.330 
and so this is why it needs to be able
to<00:01:37.200> withstand<00:01:37.380> some<00:01:37.740> pressure<00:01:37.979> so<00:01:38.310> you

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
to withstand some pressure so you

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.890 
to withstand some pressure so you
wouldn't<00:01:38.670> want<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.850> do<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.329> really<00:01:39.630> delicate

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
wouldn't want to do a really delicate

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.160 
wouldn't want to do a really delicate
design<00:01:40.470> with<00:01:40.979> this<00:01:41.189> exactly<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.570> we<00:01:42.960> need<00:01:43.079> to

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
design with this exactly and we need to

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.270 
design with this exactly and we need to
separate<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:43.740> because<00:01:43.890> I'm<00:01:43.950> going<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.100> pack

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
separate it because I'm going to pack

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.710 
separate it because I'm going to pack
the<00:01:44.430> top<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:45.060> don't<00:01:45.119> want<00:01:45.329> them<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.540> stick

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
the top and I don't want them to stick

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.719 
the top and I don't want them to stick
together<00:01:45.920> I'm<00:01:46.920> going<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.159> take<00:01:47.250> some<00:01:47.430> jewelers

sprinkle<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:49.470> on<00:01:50.750> take<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.780> brush<00:01:53.119> kind<00:01:54.119> of

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
sprinkle it on take a brush kind of

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.929 
sprinkle it on take a brush kind of
smear<00:01:54.479> it<00:01:54.540> around<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:55.430> just<00:01:56.430> put<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.759> little

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
smear it around I just put a little

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.810 
smear it around I just put a little
barrier<00:01:57.270> right<00:01:57.869> here<00:01:58.310> so<00:01:59.310> that<00:01:59.340> when<00:01:59.520> you<00:01:59.670> pull

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
barrier right here so that when you pull

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.149 
barrier right here so that when you pull
it<00:01:59.939> apart<00:02:00.030> it'll<00:02:00.869> separate<00:02:01.200> one<00:02:01.380> stick<00:02:01.680> now

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
it apart it'll separate one stick now

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.530 
it apart it'll separate one stick now
this<00:02:02.310> is<00:02:02.430> really<00:02:02.640> important<00:02:03.000> there's<00:02:03.210> two

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
this is really important there's two

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.020 
this is really important there's two
indicators<00:02:04.110> on<00:02:04.380> here<00:02:04.680> they<00:02:05.369> have<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:05.729> be<00:02:05.820> lined

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
indicators on here they have to be lined

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.839 
indicators on here they have to be lined
up<00:02:06.180> these<00:02:06.570> are<00:02:06.750> your<00:02:06.840> registration<00:02:07.469> marks

00:02:07.839 --> 00:02:07.849 
up these are your registration marks

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:09.109 
up these are your registration marks
okay

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
okay

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.930 
okay
and<00:02:09.780> if<00:02:09.959> they're<00:02:10.080> not<00:02:10.110> lined<00:02:10.440> up<00:02:10.790> you<00:02:11.790> won't

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
and if they're not lined up you won't

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.070 
and if they're not lined up you won't
know<00:02:12.060> how<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.239> put<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.540> two<00:02:12.660> halves<00:02:12.900> back

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
know how to put the two halves back

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.979 
know how to put the two halves back
together<00:02:14.150> okay<00:02:15.150> now<00:02:15.569> we're<00:02:15.690> going<00:02:15.780> to<00:02:15.870> pack

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
together okay now we're going to pack

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.130 
together okay now we're going to pack
the<00:02:16.110> top<00:02:16.819> and<00:02:17.819> this<00:02:18.269> one<00:02:18.450> you<00:02:18.540> can<00:02:18.690> pack<00:02:18.870> pretty

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
the top and this one you can pack pretty

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.920 
the top and this one you can pack pretty
heavy<00:02:19.379> the<00:02:20.040> tighter<00:02:20.340> you<00:02:20.580> pack<00:02:20.819> it<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.720> better

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
heavy the tighter you pack it the better

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.509 
heavy the tighter you pack it the better
the<00:02:22.080> next<00:02:22.470> step<00:02:22.620> is<00:02:22.769> going<00:02:22.920> to<00:02:22.980> be<00:02:23.129> which<00:02:23.370> is

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
the next step is going to be which is

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.130 
the next step is going to be which is
cutting<00:02:23.730> your<00:02:23.879> vents<00:02:24.239> in<00:02:24.390> your<00:02:24.540> poor<00:02:24.780> channel

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
cutting your vents in your poor channel

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.460 
cutting your vents in your poor channel
okay<00:02:26.150> otherwise<00:02:27.150> if<00:02:27.420> it's<00:02:27.540> real<00:02:27.720> loose<00:02:27.959> all

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
okay otherwise if it's real loose all

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.580 
okay otherwise if it's real loose all
your<00:02:28.860> channels<00:02:29.730> will<00:02:30.060> come<00:02:30.690> out<00:02:30.870> and<00:02:31.410> they'll

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
your channels will come out and they'll

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:39.740 
your channels will come out and they'll
fall<00:02:31.769> apart<00:02:38.209> now<00:02:39.209> that's<00:02:39.420> probably<00:02:39.569> about

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
fall apart now that's probably about

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.470 
fall apart now that's probably about
maybe<00:02:40.379> half<00:02:40.620> of<00:02:40.769> what<00:02:40.920> I<00:02:40.950> would<00:02:41.160> do<00:02:41.310> I<00:02:41.489> would<00:02:42.030> do

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
maybe half of what I would do I would do

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.229 
maybe half of what I would do I would do
it<00:02:42.510> there<00:02:43.049> again<00:02:43.260> twice<00:02:43.470> as<00:02:43.709> much<00:02:44.090> what<00:02:45.090> do<00:02:45.150> you

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
it there again twice as much what do you

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.509 
it there again twice as much what do you
mean<00:02:45.390> what<00:02:46.170> I<00:02:46.230> mean<00:02:46.260> is<00:02:46.440> I<00:02:46.920> would<00:02:47.099> add<00:02:47.220> more

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
mean what I mean is I would add more

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.479 
mean what I mean is I would add more
this<00:02:48.480> hand<00:02:48.900> right<00:02:49.290> this<00:02:49.530> one<00:02:49.650> is<00:02:49.860> tamping<00:02:50.370> it

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
this hand right this one is tamping it

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:51.080 
this hand right this one is tamping it
mm-hmm

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
mm-hmm

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.120 
mm-hmm
until<00:02:51.540> it<00:02:51.599> just<00:02:51.750> won't<00:02:51.840> pack<00:02:52.079> anymore<00:02:52.680> okay

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
until it just won't pack anymore okay

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.289 
until it just won't pack anymore okay
and<00:02:53.370> now<00:02:53.489> would<00:02:53.549> take<00:02:53.760> a<00:02:53.790> couple<00:02:53.940> more<00:02:54.180> minutes

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
and now would take a couple more minutes

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:55.940 
and now would take a couple more minutes
for<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.629> purposes<00:02:55.019> of<00:02:55.170> our<00:02:55.230> demonstration

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
for the purposes of our demonstration

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.800 
for the purposes of our demonstration
we'll<00:02:56.099> just<00:02:56.280> right<00:02:56.910> call<00:02:57.150> it<00:02:57.269> good<00:02:57.390> right

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
we'll just right call it good right

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:58.670 
we'll just right call it good right
because<00:02:57.959> that<00:02:57.989> would<00:02:58.170> take<00:02:58.319> a<00:02:58.349> little<00:02:58.560> more

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
because that would take a little more

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.130 
because that would take a little more
time<00:02:58.739> and<00:02:59.160> then<00:03:00.060> you're<00:03:00.599> there<00:03:00.840> again<00:03:01.049> you're

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
time and then you're there again you're

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.930 
time and then you're there again you're
going<00:03:01.230> to<00:03:01.319> shave<00:03:01.590> off<00:03:01.860> your<00:03:02.220> excess<00:03:03.709> okay<00:03:04.940> okay

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
going to shave off your excess okay okay

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.229 
going to shave off your excess okay okay
so<00:03:06.209> now<00:03:06.329> we<00:03:06.390> go<00:03:06.540> on<00:03:06.569> the<00:03:06.810> next<00:03:06.840> step<00:03:07.940> next<00:03:08.940> step

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
so now we go on the next step next step

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.150 
so now we go on the next step next step
is<00:03:09.390> going<00:03:09.569> to<00:03:09.629> be<00:03:09.810> cutting<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:10.620> vents<00:03:10.950> in<00:03:11.040> the

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
is going to be cutting the vents in the

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.280 
is going to be cutting the vents in the
poor<00:03:11.370> Channel<00:03:11.730> okay<00:03:12.390> and<00:03:12.629> it's<00:03:12.780> important<00:03:13.230> to

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
poor Channel okay and it's important to

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.530 
poor Channel okay and it's important to
vent<00:03:13.530> it<00:03:13.709> because<00:03:14.010> well<00:03:14.790> when<00:03:15.120> you<00:03:15.180> pour<00:03:15.389> our

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
vent it because well when you pour our

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.259 
vent it because well when you pour our
metal<00:03:15.780> into<00:03:15.989> a<00:03:16.019> cavity<00:03:16.530> if<00:03:16.739> the<00:03:17.730> air<00:03:17.880> inside

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
metal into a cavity if the air inside

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.599 
metal into a cavity if the air inside
that<00:03:18.450> cavity<00:03:18.630> has<00:03:18.870> no<00:03:19.019> place<00:03:19.200> to<00:03:19.230> escape<00:03:19.609> it

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
that cavity has no place to escape it

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:22.220 
that cavity has no place to escape it
won't<00:03:20.910> go<00:03:21.060> near<00:03:21.120> it<00:03:21.299> won't<00:03:21.660> go<00:03:21.780> in<00:03:21.810> there

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
won't go near it won't go in there

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.890 
won't go near it won't go in there
so<00:03:22.650> you<00:03:22.709> need<00:03:22.829> to<00:03:22.920> give<00:03:23.069> it<00:03:23.100> flow<00:03:23.940> for<00:03:24.810> the

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
so you need to give it flow for the

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.470 
so you need to give it flow for the
metal<00:03:25.139> to<00:03:25.230> go<00:03:25.349> okay<00:03:25.790> here<00:03:26.790> again<00:03:26.940> my<00:03:27.090> lines<00:03:27.329> are

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
metal to go okay here again my lines are

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.250 
metal to go okay here again my lines are
still<00:03:28.079> and<00:03:28.380> lined<00:03:28.980> up<00:03:29.190> mm-hmm<00:03:29.849> and<00:03:30.260> here's

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
still and lined up mm-hmm and here's

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:37.220 
still and lined up mm-hmm and here's
another<00:03:31.380> master<00:03:32.900> that<00:03:33.900> I<00:03:33.930> had<00:03:35.900> you<00:03:36.900> can<00:03:37.049> pull

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
another master that I had you can pull

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.520 
another master that I had you can pull
that<00:03:37.349> out<00:03:37.410> and<00:03:37.940> your<00:03:38.940> channel<00:03:39.480> your<00:03:40.260> pour

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
that out and your channel your pour

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.710 
that out and your channel your pour
channel<00:03:40.829> needs<00:03:40.980> to<00:03:41.130> be<00:03:41.310> at<00:03:42.299> least<00:03:42.419> four

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
channel needs to be at least four

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.650 
channel needs to be at least four
millimeters<00:03:43.549> so<00:03:44.549> use<00:03:44.669> a<00:03:44.700> drill<00:03:45.000> bit<00:03:45.209> mm<00:03:45.419> hm

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
millimeters so use a drill bit mm hm

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.110 
millimeters so use a drill bit mm hm
here's<00:03:45.810> your<00:03:45.930> drill<00:03:46.109> bit<00:03:46.139> drill<00:03:46.290> that<00:03:46.590> out<00:03:46.650> and

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
here's your drill bit drill that out and

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.960 
here's your drill bit drill that out and
you<00:03:48.120> can<00:03:48.269> do<00:03:48.419> your<00:03:48.569> vent<00:03:48.810> holes<00:03:49.049> the<00:03:49.290> same<00:03:49.530> way

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
you can do your vent holes the same way

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.830 
you can do your vent holes the same way
and<00:03:50.970> what<00:03:51.090> you<00:03:51.209> want<00:03:51.389> to<00:03:51.450> do<00:03:51.599> just<00:03:53.720> carve<00:03:54.720> this

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
and what you want to do just carve this

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:55.309 
and what you want to do just carve this
out

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
out

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:57.920 
out
that's<00:03:56.250> your<00:03:56.730> funnel<00:03:57.030> basically<00:03:57.480> and<00:03:57.900> you

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
that's your funnel basically and you

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.650 
that's your funnel basically and you
want<00:03:58.109> to<00:03:58.169> carve<00:03:58.319> it<00:03:58.410> out<00:03:58.470> nice<00:03:58.709> and<00:03:58.950> big<00:03:59.660> recap

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
want to carve it out nice and big recap

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.540 
want to carve it out nice and big recap
it

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
it

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.640 
it
and<00:04:03.300> now<00:04:03.480> we're<00:04:03.630> going<00:04:03.720> to<00:04:03.810> be<00:04:03.930> ready<00:04:04.140> to<00:04:04.230> pour

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
and now we're going to be ready to pour

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.140 
and now we're going to be ready to pour
okay<00:04:05.780> so<00:04:06.780> rapport<00:04:07.140> I<00:04:07.490> have<00:04:08.490> an<00:04:08.580> electro<00:04:08.940> melt

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
okay so rapport I have an electro melt

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.430 
okay so rapport I have an electro melt
which<00:04:09.300> is<00:04:09.480> really<00:04:09.750> heating<00:04:10.230> up<00:04:10.260> the<00:04:10.410> metal

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
which is really heating up the metal

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.970 
which is really heating up the metal
this<00:04:10.890> is<00:04:11.010> bronze<00:04:11.250> and<00:04:11.630> it's<00:04:12.630> heating<00:04:12.900> to<00:04:13.020> 1950

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
this is bronze and it's heating to 1950

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.860 
this is bronze and it's heating to 1950
degrees<00:04:14.280> but<00:04:14.820> it<00:04:14.910> was<00:04:15.030> very<00:04:15.270> depending<00:04:15.780> on

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
degrees but it was very depending on

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.420 
degrees but it was very depending on
what<00:04:16.050> type<00:04:16.230> of<00:04:16.260> metal<00:04:16.470> you're<00:04:16.709> using<00:04:16.890> right

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
what type of metal you're using right

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.830 
what type of metal you're using right
right<00:04:17.640> you<00:04:17.760> got<00:04:17.910> to<00:04:18.000> consult<00:04:18.420> the<00:04:18.510> melting

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
right you got to consult the melting

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.500 
right you got to consult the melting
temperature<00:04:19.880> you<00:04:20.880> want<00:04:20.940> me<00:04:21.060> to<00:04:21.120> move<00:04:21.209> this<00:04:21.360> out

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
temperature you want me to move this out

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.230 
temperature you want me to move this out

I'll check the outside turn crack this
open<00:04:46.980> you<00:04:47.220> can<00:04:47.340> see<00:04:47.460> how<00:04:47.580> hot<00:04:47.820> that<00:04:47.850> is<00:04:48.260> okay<00:04:49.260> oh

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
open you can see how hot that is okay oh

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.890 
open you can see how hot that is okay oh
yeah<00:04:49.940> and<00:04:50.940> then<00:04:51.120> we're<00:04:51.210> gonna<00:04:51.300> grab<00:04:51.480> it<00:04:51.660> we<00:04:51.750> got

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
yeah and then we're gonna grab it we got

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.300 
yeah and then we're gonna grab it we got
to<00:04:51.990> be<00:04:52.050> fairly<00:04:52.380> quick<00:04:52.680> because<00:04:52.860> it<00:04:53.010> will<00:04:53.100> cool

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
to be fairly quick because it will cool

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:58.400 
to be fairly quick because it will cool
down<00:04:56.450> so<00:04:57.450> you're<00:04:57.600> pouring<00:04:57.840> the<00:04:58.020> metal<00:04:58.290> now

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
down so you're pouring the metal now

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.680 
down so you're pouring the metal now
right<00:04:58.740> into<00:04:59.130> that<00:04:59.280> channel<00:05:00.270> that<00:05:00.390> you<00:05:00.510> made

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
right into that channel that you made

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.340 
right into that channel that you made
mm-hmm<00:05:01.470> there's<00:05:02.010> our<00:05:02.160> flame<00:05:03.080> how<00:05:04.080> do<00:05:04.140> you<00:05:04.260> know

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
mm-hmm there's our flame how do you know

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:05.780 
mm-hmm there's our flame how do you know
how<00:05:04.470> much<00:05:04.620> when<00:05:05.010> it<00:05:05.130> starts<00:05:05.370> to<00:05:05.430> bubble<00:05:05.550> out

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.790 
how much when it starts to bubble out

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:07.610 
how much when it starts to bubble out
the<00:05:05.880> top<00:05:06.060> it<00:05:06.810> starts<00:05:06.900> to<00:05:07.110> bubble<00:05:07.230> at<00:05:07.470> the<00:05:07.500> top

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
the top it starts to bubble at the top

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.920 
the top it starts to bubble at the top
like<00:05:07.980> that<00:05:08.480> now<00:05:09.480> when<00:05:09.600> you're<00:05:09.720> calculating

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
like that now when you're calculating

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.620 
like that now when you're calculating
how<00:05:10.740> much<00:05:10.920> you<00:05:11.100> need<00:05:11.280> you're<00:05:12.240> just<00:05:12.450> going<00:05:12.600> to

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
how much you need you're just going to

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.860 
how much you need you're just going to
have<00:05:12.870> to<00:05:13.080> kind<00:05:13.560> of<00:05:13.650> guess<00:05:13.890> and<00:05:14.220> then<00:05:14.340> double<00:05:14.640> it

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
have to kind of guess and then double it

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.640 
have to kind of guess and then double it
so<00:05:15.870> whatever<00:05:16.230> you<00:05:16.320> think<00:05:16.350> you<00:05:16.650> need<00:05:17.090> times<00:05:18.090> two

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
so whatever you think you need times two

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.110 
so whatever you think you need times two
times<00:05:19.650> two<00:05:19.890> times<00:05:20.070> so<00:05:20.520> you're<00:05:20.610> quenching<00:05:21.030> and

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
times two times so you're quenching and

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.240 
times two times so you're quenching and
is<00:05:21.510> that<00:05:21.690> just<00:05:21.870> water<00:05:22.050> just<00:05:22.560> water<00:05:22.740> to<00:05:23.040> cool<00:05:23.190> it

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
is that just water just water to cool it

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.390 
is that just water just water to cool it
down<00:05:23.370> to<00:05:23.520> cool<00:05:23.850> it<00:05:23.970> down<00:05:24.120> and<00:05:25.250> what's<00:05:26.250> really

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
down to cool it down and what's really

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.000 
down to cool it down and what's really
neat<00:05:26.640> is<00:05:26.820> when<00:05:27.480> you're<00:05:27.600> done<00:05:27.750> you<00:05:28.710> can<00:05:28.770> just

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.010 
neat is when you're done you can just

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.700 
neat is when you're done you can just
pull<00:05:29.160> it<00:05:29.190> apart<00:05:29.570> and<00:05:30.570> there's<00:05:31.170> your<00:05:31.290> cast<00:05:31.500> net

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
pull it apart and there's your cast net

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.980 
pull it apart and there's your cast net
is<00:05:31.830> amazing<00:05:32.400> you<00:05:32.940> push<00:05:33.180> it<00:05:33.300> out<00:05:33.450> and<00:05:33.690> break<00:05:33.840> it

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
is amazing you push it out and break it

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.010 
is amazing you push it out and break it
out<00:05:34.080> and<00:05:34.320> you<00:05:34.980> can<00:05:35.160> reuse<00:05:35.340> all<00:05:35.730> this<00:05:36.020> except

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
out and you can reuse all this except

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.530 
out and you can reuse all this except
that<00:05:37.080> what's<00:05:37.320> black<00:05:38.000> whatever<00:05:39.000> is<00:05:39.180> black<00:05:39.390> you
