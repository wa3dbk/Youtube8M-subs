00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:33.500
 Today I will tell you the LED 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:38.060
 illumination of the instrument panel and arrows I 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:40.130
 you this is a diode unit yavata collected as 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:43.329
 saw for that we will need four 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:47.780
 LED and 4 resistors for 4 resistors 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:49.610
 act when installing a rubber resistor 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.630
 on each LED will be received and 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:55.010
 maximally use a resistor 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:01:00.590
 one kilo 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:04.399
 whether color is about to get to your taste also 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:09.889
 we will need a pad for in this 

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:12.409
 case of the tachometer scale here it is yes 

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:15.340
 standard leg for scale will be replaced 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:20.689
 and everyday life will be done 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:23.209
 transparent overlay also i will put 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:26.240
 luminous arrow that's for the arrow itself 

00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:28.159
 i have this part from old 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:34.700
 the capacitor it cut down 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:41.569
 and the arrow here is the blank he has on it 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:46.130
 risks that should be removed so 

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:49.099
 further along the assembly of the resistor itself 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:52.340
 backlight assembly and quite simply 

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:54.319
 makes simple tracks draws ordinary 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.899
 nail polish then all this is vatra 

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:59.619
 pouring in makes of a hole and everything 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:59.619
 we solder 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:07.740
 Here is an example of such a blank 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:12.150
 plastic for the scale here is transparent on 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:15.450
 she will she puts will be put on 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.740
 place of the native in this case 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.520
 native tachometer scale 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:23.670
 Now I will show you here so here 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:26.340
 will also be put on will not 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.610
 to be glued on this one 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.610
 such 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:37.110
 so polishing the arrow is introduced small 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:43.640
 needle file to bring the arrow to the maximum 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:43.640
 transparent state as seen on video 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.800
 so well that's the arrow I polished now 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.180
 we will make a seat for 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:56.959
 arrows in 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.959
 here this capacitor billet 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.310
 Here's a blank in my 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.590
 turned arrow tightly enough 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:08.910
 sits though i'm not glued yet 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:13.830
 and did nothing with her now we need 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:17.810
 will remove the surplus from the arrow and how 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.810
 mind the arrow is already starting to acquire 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:30.790
 so I painted the lower part of the arrow for 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.750
 order to better reflect the light diode varnish 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.390
 with sparkles 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:38.620
 for the best reflection as I have already 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.190
 spoke while the varnish dries i will also 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.300
 to put 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:44.860
 leg to produce leg for the most 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.210
 the arrow here I have such power 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:50.140
 dagh. 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:53.280
 I will cut it off with a heated 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:57.340
 needles made a small hole and 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:59.560
 I will attach to the tachometer needle and then 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.750
 all of this will be attached to the currents to 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:05.520
 work now I 'll show you here is photo 3 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.520
 Chalky squiggle if you see 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.680
 Well, here is a mount for me 

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:25.949
 received 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.990
 seva glue arrows or 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:31.350
 I will use the usual desirable 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:34.550
 transparent for most better so for now 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.720
 the arrow is glued we will deal with the dial 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.479
 now I need to do a little 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:42.660
 hand guards and glued dial 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:45.840
 on top of the plate here I got 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:49.979
 Such a dial specially made a hole 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:54.800
 more so that the LED beam passes 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:54.800
 maximum to the arrow so 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.090
 about the LED for the arrow i 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:04.630
 used at first so small but 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:07.160
 they did not suit us not enough brightness 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:11.590
 so I had to use the usual 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:15.560
 standard red LED here 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:18.620
 stuff them under the base well, as under the 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:23.560
 spring when up to the metro here it will be necessary there 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:28.009
 This is how you see this: ponies 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:30.740
 surrounded by me this is a block of diodes to me 

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:32.590
 will have to solder another resistor for 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:38.710
 red diode between 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:38.710
 I think to dissolve between one of the diodes 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:49.770
 I did the same for the nation in the bank 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:50.570
 speedometer to avoid short 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:53.370
 closures 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:57.120
 if you doubt this isolation then 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:06:00.380
 I'm with such a fucking fare 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.380
 year and everything is fine 

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:13.800
 Well, I soldered to do to the general 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:19.050
 they will now be pro for zap and 1 2 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:22.770
 3 for working as seen here is red 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:27.110
 United States relatives are excellent 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:27.110
 here are the red arrows 

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:41.000
 so I installed a diode under 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:44.599
 the fund will now put these on top 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:47.949
 scales and then would fix the arrow in general 

00:06:44.599 --> 00:06:47.949
 we start to start link 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:53.350
 here 

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:56.790
 hooked up as you see now I'll be everything 

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:56.790
 fold into the body 

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:02.550
 you see the work is not enough, it turned out 

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:02.550
 Not bad
