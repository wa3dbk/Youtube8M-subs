00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 so almost as exciting as the hoeneÃŸ 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.250
 process my ladies and gentlemen almost like that 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.620
 exciting again hoeneÃŸ 'process is behind 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.500
 as before the situation in the Crimea on 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:14.580
 On sunday the criminals vote for the chinese 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.890
 the KrÃ¤mers says at a referendum 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.619
 I think I'm about to join 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.869
 Russia from where I have to ask 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.430
 is that really a free choice 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.199
 maybe German can watch TV 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.680
 then check again investigatively 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.300
 hello we are from German television 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:35.940
 you've got 45 on your mouth 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.870
 do you want to have one again but yes 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.800
 just because we were on two fronts 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.149
 At the same time, it does not matter 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.770
 confusing situations over there 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.649
 in the Crimea in Ukraine clear this 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.640
 you want a new ukrainian government 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.520
 also not at night in the underpass 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.110
 meet but there were reasons for that 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.780
 that you have your old president 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.329
 chased away next to his preference too 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.890
 pomp and show had Yanukovich too 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:04.019
 a faible for the religion 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.030
 that's a private church they have like that 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.560
 something already seen somewhere in yes 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.560
 Limburg question 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:19.979
 they have also chased into the monastery 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.540
 so what strikes me and what I do 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.010
 it is very bad indeed 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.990
 meanwhile no longer around the 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.440
 people in ukraine or on the 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.270
 Crimea 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.409
 Actually, it's just about a how 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.840
 This is called a geopolitical one 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.680
 tail comparison between russians and 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.750
 americans 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.399
 these two nations explain themselves 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.990
 now around each other around the clock 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:41.850
 international law here respect john kerry 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.159
 does not belong in a country 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.990
 at gunpoint and invade 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.320
 your will to enforce 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:53.000
 so may a g8 great power in the 21st 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.000
 not betrayed in the 20th century 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.340
 how shit international law the 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.020
 US Secretary of State says 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.480
 drawn weapon in other countries 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.120
 Engineer film is clearly real men 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.010
 send drones on the donkey yes the stupid 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.630
 republicans in the usa are calling now 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.670
 the whole world the third world war 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.050
 And President Obama has to be the tough dog 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.980
 play here for example had one 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.120
 meeting with his security advisors 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.700
 unanimous decision will putin 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.840
 taken away form 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.880
 The whole is then really only 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.830
 in front of like kindergarten from the us 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.600
 government paid experts and it 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:41.050
 no seat is now busy 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.150
 all day with putin's body language he 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.070
 trying to intimidate us here for 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.550
 For example, he forms one with his hand 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.500
 zero 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.050
 he probably thinks that this is the usa 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.330
 and they hack the hand movement 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.570
 is totally aggressive like a karate 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.570

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.750
 propaganda the little dog has one 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.180
 he wants to be a border soldier 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.950

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.959
 Officers the borders of our country 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:21.270
