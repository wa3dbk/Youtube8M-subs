on and test it we've got a wireless
transmitter<00:01:38.329> here<00:01:38.509> with<00:01:38.659> the<00:01:38.749> mic<00:01:38.929> I'm<00:01:39.139> gonna

00:01:39.309 --> 00:01:39.319 
transmitter here with the mic I'm gonna

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:40.840 
transmitter here with the mic I'm gonna
wake<00:01:39.530> the<00:01:39.679> camera<00:01:40.009> up<00:01:40.130> just<00:01:40.310> by<00:01:40.429> touching<00:01:40.670> the

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
wake the camera up just by touching the

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.819 
wake the camera up just by touching the
shutter<00:01:41.090> button<00:01:41.149> and<00:01:41.569> then<00:01:42.049> I'm<00:01:42.139> going<00:01:42.439> to<00:01:42.469> go

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829 
shutter button and then I'm going to go

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:45.099 
shutter button and then I'm going to go
ahead<00:01:42.950> and<00:01:43.310> grab<00:01:43.639> the<00:01:43.819> mic<00:01:43.999> and<00:01:44.270> because<00:01:44.990> it

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:45.109 
ahead and grab the mic and because it

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:47.319 
ahead and grab the mic and because it
seems<00:01:45.380> like<00:01:45.560> I<00:01:45.590> have<00:01:45.859> to<00:01:46.069> make<00:01:46.310> sad<00:01:46.909> funny

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:47.329 
seems like I have to make sad funny

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:48.999 
seems like I have to make sad funny
noise<00:01:47.569> every<00:01:48.049> time<00:01:48.229> I<00:01:48.560> make<00:01:48.740> one<00:01:48.859> of<00:01:48.889> these

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
noise every time I make one of these

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:50.859 
noise every time I make one of these
videos<00:01:49.369> I'm<00:01:49.850> gonna<00:01:49.969> go<00:01:50.149> ahead<00:01:50.240> and<00:01:50.359> hum<00:01:50.659> into

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
videos I'm gonna go ahead and hum into

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:52.300 
videos I'm gonna go ahead and hum into
the<00:01:50.990> mic<00:01:51.139> to<00:01:51.289> fire<00:01:51.469> the<00:01:51.649> camera<00:01:51.799> I<00:01:51.979> find<00:01:52.189> it's

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
the mic to fire the camera I find it's

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.930 
the mic to fire the camera I find it's
the<00:01:52.399> most<00:01:52.549> reliable<00:01:52.999> way<00:01:53.119> so<00:01:53.780> here<00:01:53.959> we<00:01:54.049> go

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.580 

you<00:01:57.940> can<00:01:58.090> see<00:01:58.240> it's<00:01:58.360> very<00:01:58.450> sensitive<00:01:58.900> if<00:01:59.530> I

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
you can see it's very sensitive if I

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.210 
you can see it's very sensitive if I
continue<00:02:00.010> to<00:02:00.100> hum<00:02:00.250> it<00:02:00.400> will<00:02:00.520> continue<00:02:00.850> to<00:02:00.940> fire

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.890 

like<00:02:06.220> so<00:02:06.460> now<00:02:07.090> I've<00:02:07.270> found<00:02:07.510> that<00:02:07.600> it<00:02:07.720> works

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
like so now I've found that it works

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.320 
like so now I've found that it works
with<00:02:08.050> just<00:02:08.080> about<00:02:08.350> any<00:02:08.650> loud<00:02:08.860> sharp<00:02:09.220> noise<00:02:09.460> you

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
with just about any loud sharp noise you

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.150 
with just about any loud sharp noise you
can<00:02:10.570> say<00:02:10.810> cheese<00:02:11.200> for<00:02:11.500> instance<00:02:11.830> into<00:02:12.040> the

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
can say cheese for instance into the

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.860 
can say cheese for instance into the
microphone<00:02:12.610> and<00:02:12.790> it<00:02:13.090> will<00:02:13.240> fire<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:13.690> camera

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
microphone and it will fire the camera

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.590 
microphone and it will fire the camera
so<00:02:14.470> that<00:02:14.830> is<00:02:15.130> way<00:02:15.580> number<00:02:15.820> one<00:02:15.910> or<00:02:16.330> method

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
so that is way number one or method

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.930 
so that is way number one or method
number<00:02:16.720> one<00:02:16.870> firing<00:02:17.620> your<00:02:17.980> camera<00:02:18.370> via<00:02:18.580> just<00:02:18.790> a

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
number one firing your camera via just a

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.570 
number one firing your camera via just a
standard<00:02:19.420> lapel<00:02:20.080> mic<00:02:20.350> is<00:02:20.560> a<00:02:20.650> sound<00:02:21.130> trigger

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
standard lapel mic is a sound trigger

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.000 
standard lapel mic is a sound trigger
with<00:02:21.850> a<00:02:21.880> wireless<00:02:22.120> transmitter<00:02:22.810> the<00:02:23.560> range<00:02:23.800> is

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
with a wireless transmitter the range is

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.040 
with a wireless transmitter the range is
about<00:02:24.120> fifty<00:02:25.120> or<00:02:25.150> sixty<00:02:25.420> feet<00:02:25.720> on<00:02:25.930> this

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
about fifty or sixty feet on this

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.930 
about fifty or sixty feet on this
particular<00:02:26.380> unit<00:02:26.830> although<00:02:27.640> it<00:02:27.820> could

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
particular unit although it could

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.380 
particular unit although it could
probably<00:02:28.180> be<00:02:28.360> longer<00:02:28.810> in<00:02:29.020> clear<00:02:29.760> open<00:02:30.760> area<00:02:31.120> so

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
probably be longer in clear open area so

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.140 
probably be longer in clear open area so
that's<00:02:31.900> that<00:02:32.200> now<00:02:32.650> we<00:02:33.250> move<00:02:33.430> on<00:02:33.640> to<00:02:33.670> the<00:02:33.910> really

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
that's that now we move on to the really

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.090 
that's that now we move on to the really
interesting<00:02:34.330> stuff<00:02:34.600> when<00:02:35.230> we<00:02:35.380> introduce<00:02:35.890> an

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
interesting stuff when we introduce an

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.620 
interesting stuff when we introduce an
iPhone<00:02:38.760> ok<00:02:39.760> excellent<00:02:40.000> so<00:02:40.240> this<00:02:40.390> is<00:02:40.510> the

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
iPhone ok excellent so this is the

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.350 
iPhone ok excellent so this is the
second<00:02:40.990> setup<00:02:41.170> what<00:02:42.070> we've<00:02:42.220> got<00:02:42.400> here<00:02:42.700> is<00:02:42.760> you

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
second setup what we've got here is you

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.000 
second setup what we've got here is you
can<00:02:43.480> see<00:02:43.510> I've<00:02:43.690> substituted<00:02:44.020> the<00:02:44.470> microphone

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
can see I've substituted the microphone

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.000 
can see I've substituted the microphone
for<00:02:45.910> a<00:02:46.240> an<00:02:46.630> iPhone<00:02:47.110> plugged<00:02:47.530> into<00:02:47.740> the<00:02:47.860> same

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
for a an iPhone plugged into the same

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.240 
for a an iPhone plugged into the same
jack<00:02:48.310> with<00:02:48.670> a<00:02:48.850> mono<00:02:49.210> headphone<00:02:50.110> cable<00:02:50.530> I<00:02:50.710> found

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
jack with a mono headphone cable I found

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.980 
jack with a mono headphone cable I found
that<00:02:51.370> the<00:02:51.490> mono<00:02:51.700> cable<00:02:52.090> works<00:02:52.300> the<00:02:52.510> best<00:02:52.720> here

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
that the mono cable works the best here

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.300 
that the mono cable works the best here
I<00:02:53.020> don't<00:02:53.230> know<00:02:53.320> why<00:02:53.470> but<00:02:53.740> it<00:02:53.860> tends<00:02:54.040> to<00:02:54.130> work

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
I don't know why but it tends to work

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.640 
I don't know why but it tends to work
the<00:02:54.430> best<00:02:54.580> and<00:02:54.910> then<00:02:55.390> down<00:02:55.960> here<00:02:56.230> I<00:02:56.260> have<00:02:56.530> the

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
the best and then down here I have the

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.220 
the best and then down here I have the
iPod<00:02:57.100> app<00:02:57.340> open<00:02:57.790> and<00:02:58.540> then<00:02:58.690> I'm<00:02:58.810> going<00:02:59.080> to<00:02:59.110> make

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
iPod app open and then I'm going to make

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.280 
iPod app open and then I'm going to make
sure<00:02:59.350> that<00:02:59.470> the<00:02:59.560> cameras<00:02:59.980> awake<00:03:00.280> here<00:03:01.290> all

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
sure that the cameras awake here all

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.230 
sure that the cameras awake here all
right<00:03:02.560> there<00:03:02.860> we<00:03:03.010> are<00:03:03.040> and<00:03:03.370> then<00:03:03.430> I'm<00:03:03.970> going<00:03:04.209> to

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
right there we are and then I'm going to

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.280 
right there we are and then I'm going to
go<00:03:04.420> ahead<00:03:04.600> and<00:03:04.810> fire<00:03:06.690> just<00:03:07.690> by<00:03:07.810> hitting<00:03:08.020> play

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
go ahead and fire just by hitting play

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.710 
go ahead and fire just by hitting play
so<00:03:09.010> if<00:03:09.340> we<00:03:09.459> bring<00:03:09.670> down<00:03:09.730> to<00:03:09.940> the<00:03:10.060> iPod<00:03:10.420> control

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
so if we bring down to the iPod control

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.170 
so if we bring down to the iPod control

again<00:03:13.420> they<00:03:13.720> can<00:03:13.900> will<00:03:14.140> fire<00:03:14.380> once<00:03:15.630> like<00:03:16.630> so<00:03:16.900> if

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
again they can will fire once like so if

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.170 
again they can will fire once like so if
you<00:03:17.530> want<00:03:17.680> it<00:03:17.739> to<00:03:17.830> continue<00:03:17.980> to<00:03:18.250> fire<00:03:18.489> continue

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
you want it to continue to fire continue

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.240 
you want it to continue to fire continue
playing<00:03:19.420> the<00:03:19.570> song<00:03:20.370> and<00:03:22.410> then<00:03:23.410> stop<00:03:23.709> like<00:03:24.010> so

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
setup and this is where it gets really

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:39.660 
setup and this is where it gets really
interesting

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
you go so I was triggering the camera

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.510 
you go so I was triggering the camera
over<00:04:25.570> the<00:04:25.690> phone<00:04:25.930> call<00:04:26.169> to<00:04:26.440> the<00:04:26.560> iPhone<00:04:26.980> so

what this means is that you could
literally<00:04:29.110> trigger<00:04:29.620> a<00:04:29.740> camera<00:04:30.220> anywhere<00:04:30.730> in

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
literally trigger a camera anywhere in

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.750 
literally trigger a camera anywhere in
the<00:04:31.000> world<00:04:31.180> with<00:04:32.110> a<00:04:32.139> phone

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.340 

excellent<00:04:36.760> so<00:04:36.910> just<00:04:37.120> to<00:04:37.210> recap<00:04:37.570> we<00:04:38.020> covered

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:38.350 
excellent so just to recap we covered

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:39.750 
excellent so just to recap we covered
three<00:04:38.560> different<00:04:38.860> ways<00:04:39.010> to<00:04:39.040> trigger<00:04:39.520> your

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
three different ways to trigger your

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.210 
three different ways to trigger your
DSLR<00:04:40.330> while<00:04:40.870> with<00:04:41.139> these<00:04:41.380> wireless

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
DSLR while with these wireless

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.760 
DSLR while with these wireless
microphones<00:04:42.820> one<00:04:43.540> you<00:04:43.900> can<00:04:44.050> trigger<00:04:44.290> it<00:04:44.410> using

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
microphones one you can trigger it using

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.040 
microphones one you can trigger it using
just<00:04:44.979> sound<00:04:45.280> so<00:04:45.700> you<00:04:45.760> can<00:04:46.030> make<00:04:46.690> a<00:04:46.720> loud<00:04:46.990> noise

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
just sound so you can make a loud noise

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.560 
just sound so you can make a loud noise
into<00:04:47.530> the<00:04:47.560> microphone<00:04:48.040> and<00:04:48.220> a<00:04:48.340> fire

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
into the microphone and a fire

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.090 
into the microphone and a fire
wirelessly<00:04:49.570> I'm<00:04:49.870> up<00:04:49.960> to<00:04:50.080> about<00:04:50.110> 6070<00:04:50.889> feet

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
wirelessly I'm up to about 6070 feet

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.490 
wirelessly I'm up to about 6070 feet
then<00:04:51.790> the<00:04:51.820> second<00:04:52.330> way<00:04:52.450> is<00:04:52.479> you<00:04:53.020> can<00:04:53.169> use<00:04:53.380> your

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
then the second way is you can use your

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.920 
then the second way is you can use your
iPhone<00:04:53.790> and<00:04:54.790> plug<00:04:55.030> it<00:04:55.150> into<00:04:55.270> your<00:04:55.360> iPhone<00:04:55.750> and

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
iPhone and plug it into your iPhone and

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.680 
iPhone and plug it into your iPhone and
then<00:04:55.990> play<00:04:56.410> an<00:04:56.770> audio<00:04:57.130> track<00:04:57.340> IPOP<00:04:58.000> track<00:04:58.270> or

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
then play an audio track IPOP track or

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.050 
then play an audio track IPOP track or
even<00:04:59.169> record<00:04:59.680> a<00:04:59.770> sound<00:05:00.040> and<00:05:00.370> have<00:05:00.669> it<00:05:00.820> play

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
even record a sound and have it play

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.270 
even record a sound and have it play
back<00:05:01.270> the<00:05:02.080> sound<00:05:02.380> and<00:05:02.710> it<00:05:02.800> will<00:05:02.919> fire<00:05:03.100> the

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
back the sound and it will fire the

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.340 
back the sound and it will fire the
camera<00:05:03.460> for<00:05:03.790> you<00:05:03.910> and<00:05:04.120> then<00:05:04.510> the<00:05:04.600> third<00:05:04.840> way<00:05:05.050> is

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.350 
camera for you and then the third way is

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.710 
camera for you and then the third way is
you<00:05:05.620> can<00:05:05.770> actually<00:05:05.919> call<00:05:06.370> your<00:05:06.520> iPhone<00:05:07.000> hooked

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
you can actually call your iPhone hooked

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.840 
you can actually call your iPhone hooked
up<00:05:07.930> to<00:05:08.140> the<00:05:08.229> wireless<00:05:08.590> mics<00:05:08.860> and<00:05:09.160> then<00:05:09.580> fire

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:09.850 
up to the wireless mics and then fire

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:11.279 
up to the wireless mics and then fire
your<00:05:10.060> camera<00:05:10.360> from<00:05:10.450> anywhere<00:05:10.900> in<00:05:11.020> the<00:05:11.080> world

at the end plugging your phone directly
into<00:05:21.400> the<00:05:21.490> camera<00:05:21.700> will<00:05:22.060> not<00:05:22.240> work<00:05:22.450> because<00:05:23.200> it

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
into the camera will not work because it

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.230 
into the camera will not work because it
does<00:05:23.740> not<00:05:23.950> have<00:05:24.220> any<00:05:24.550> way<00:05:24.700> to<00:05:24.729> break<00:05:25.060> the

connection break the contact that's what

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.130 
connection break the contact that's what
the<00:05:27.430> wireless<00:05:27.729> mics<00:05:27.940> provide<00:05:28.300> a<00:05:28.330> way<00:05:28.570> to<00:05:28.630> stop

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:29.140 
the wireless mics provide a way to stop

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.110 
the wireless mics provide a way to stop
the<00:05:29.350> contact<00:05:29.800> which<00:05:29.950> is<00:05:30.100> what<00:05:30.310> completes<00:05:30.940> that

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
the contact which is what completes that

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.600 
the contact which is what completes that
and<00:05:31.530> what<00:05:32.530> breaks<00:05:32.740> a<00:05:32.830> circuit<00:05:33.190> and<00:05:33.280> then<00:05:33.400> fires
