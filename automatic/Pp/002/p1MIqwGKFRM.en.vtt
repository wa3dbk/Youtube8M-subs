times on the a string or actually it's

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.339 
times on the a string or actually it's
just<00:03:50.579> one<00:03:50.879> time<00:03:51.150> but<00:03:51.510> we're<00:03:51.659> going<00:03:51.750> to<00:03:51.810> the

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:52.349 
just one time but we're going to the

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:55.039 
just one time but we're going to the
second<00:03:52.799> time<00:03:52.950> is<00:03:53.159> us<00:03:53.849> actually<00:03:54.150> starting<00:03:54.750> over

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
second time is us actually starting over

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:58.970 
second time is us actually starting over
so<00:03:55.290> you<00:03:55.709> do<00:03:55.890> plug<00:03:56.129> it<00:03:56.250> two<00:03:56.340> times<00:03:56.489> in<00:03:56.760> a<00:03:56.849> row<00:03:57.980> so

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
so you do plug it two times in a row so

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.319 
so you do plug it two times in a row so
basically<00:03:59.700> if<00:03:59.849> that<00:04:00.000> got<00:04:00.180> a<00:04:00.209> little
