I've done long walks from the same

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.540 
I've done long walks from the same
starting<00:00:27.779> point<00:00:28.220> south<00:00:29.220> down<00:00:29.519> the

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
starting point south down the

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.420 
starting point south down the
Continental<00:00:30.240> Divide<00:00:30.269> alleged<00:00:31.170> Mexico<00:00:31.590> an<00:00:32.160> or

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
Continental Divide alleged Mexico an or

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.460 
Continental Divide alleged Mexico an or
four<00:00:32.699> lengths<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.000> Canadian<00:00:33.390> Rockies<00:00:33.470> so

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.470 
four lengths the Canadian Rockies so

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.439 
four lengths the Canadian Rockies so
going<00:00:34.769> back<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.160> same<00:00:35.339> place<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:35.909> walking

00:00:36.439 --> 00:00:36.449 
going back to the same place and walking

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:39.770 
going back to the same place and walking
west<00:00:36.920> seemed<00:00:37.920> very<00:00:38.100> attractive<00:00:38.760> but<00:00:39.600> also

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
west seemed very attractive but also

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.439 
west seemed very attractive but also
because<00:00:40.320> it's<00:00:40.650> a<00:00:41.010> mountain<00:00:41.640> route<00:00:41.850> through

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:42.449 
because it's a mountain route through

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:44.390 
because it's a mountain route through
wild<00:00:42.960> country<00:00:43.559> mostly<00:00:44.040> which<00:00:44.220> I've<00:00:44.370> never

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:44.400 
wild country mostly which I've never

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.630 
wild country mostly which I've never
seen<00:00:44.670> that's<00:00:45.479> attractive<00:00:46.379> as<00:00:46.530> well<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:47.489> I

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
seen that's attractive as well and I

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.549 
seen that's attractive as well and I
like<00:00:47.790> the<00:00:47.940> idea<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.210> walking<00:00:48.420> from<00:00:49.379> the

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
like the idea of walking from the

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.729 
like the idea of walking from the
Rockies<00:00:49.949> to<00:00:50.339> the<00:00:50.489> Pacific<00:00:50.820> Ocean<00:00:51.379> look<00:00:52.379> close

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
Rockies to the Pacific Ocean look close

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.649 
Rockies to the Pacific Ocean look close
good<00:00:53.040> tell<00:00:53.850> me<00:00:53.970> a<00:00:54.000> little<00:00:54.030> bit<00:00:54.299> about<00:00:54.510> the

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:54.659 
good tell me a little bit about the

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:56.780 
good tell me a little bit about the
history<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:55.049> the<00:00:55.260> truth<00:00:55.489> well<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.580> trail

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:56.790 
history of the truth well the trail

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.299 
history of the truth well the trail
really<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.809> idea<00:00:58.170> came<00:00:58.379> from<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.680> hiker<00:00:58.890> called

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
really the idea came from a hiker called

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.289 
really the idea came from a hiker called
one<00:00:59.519> Strickland<00:01:00.030> back<00:01:00.600> in<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.869> 1970s<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:02.299> he

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:03.299 
one Strickland back in the 1970s and he

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:05.509 
one Strickland back in the 1970s and he
thought<00:01:03.510> there<00:01:04.080> isn't<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.439> trail<00:01:04.680> no<00:01:05.250> in<00:01:05.369> this

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
thought there isn't a trail no in this

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.030 
thought there isn't a trail no in this
way<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:06.060> ought<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.390> be<00:01:06.570> one<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.140> Heep

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
way that ought to be one and Heep

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.550 
way that ought to be one and Heep
respected<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:08.910> know<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.120> initial<00:01:09.300> route<00:01:09.750> and

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
respected you know the initial route and

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.820 
respected you know the initial route and
then<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.800> society<00:01:11.700> was<00:01:11.970> formed<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:13.290> try<00:01:13.620> and

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
then a society was formed to try and

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.920 
then a society was formed to try and
build<00:01:14.010> it<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.430> promote<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.330> he<00:01:15.600> wrote<00:01:15.780> the

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
build it and promote it and he wrote the

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.020 
build it and promote it and he wrote the
guide<00:01:16.140> book<00:01:16.410> but<00:01:17.250> these<00:01:17.370> things<00:01:17.400> take<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.790> very

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
guide book but these things take a very

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.020 
guide book but these things take a very
long<00:01:18.090> time<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.870> think<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:20.280> became<00:01:20.670> an<00:01:20.910> official

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
long time I think it became an official

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.970 
long time I think it became an official
trail<00:01:21.690> when<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.290> states<00:01:22.560> they<00:01:22.740> call<00:01:22.890> the

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:22.980 
trail when the states they call the

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.220 
trail when the states they call the
National<00:01:23.370> Scenic<00:01:23.940> Trail<00:01:24.090> just<00:01:24.900> lightening

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:25.230 
National Scenic Trail just lightening

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.510 
National Scenic Trail just lightening
the<00:01:25.350> official<00:01:25.770> long-distance

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
the official long-distance

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.929 
the official long-distance
that's<00:01:26.729> here<00:01:27.000> but<00:01:27.659> two<00:01:28.170> years<00:01:28.200> ago<00:01:31.250> so<00:01:32.250> why<00:01:32.729> now

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
that's here but two years ago so why now

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.270 
that's here but two years ago so why now
we<00:01:33.689> want<00:01:33.929> to<00:01:34.020> your<00:01:34.259> own<00:01:34.350> question<00:01:34.860> or<00:01:35.009> is<00:01:35.130> it

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
we want to your own question or is it

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.889 
we want to your own question or is it
because<00:01:35.490> it's<00:01:35.880> become<00:01:36.149> an<00:01:36.240> official<00:01:36.479> trailer

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:36.899 
because it's become an official trailer

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:39.050 
because it's become an official trailer
is<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.259> for<00:01:37.649> your<00:01:37.860> own<00:01:37.979> personal<00:01:38.250> losses<00:01:38.670> but

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
is it for your own personal losses but

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.120 
is it for your own personal losses but
you're<00:01:39.210> choosing<00:01:39.600> still<00:01:39.899> ice<00:01:40.289> it's<00:01:40.829> not

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
you're choosing still ice it's not

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.010 
you're choosing still ice it's not
because<00:01:41.520> it's<00:01:41.939> become<00:01:42.240> an<00:01:42.359> official<00:01:42.630> trail

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
because it's become an official trail

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.279 
because it's become an official trail
it's<00:01:46.759> it's<00:01:47.759> partly<00:01:48.209> because<00:01:48.360> it's<00:01:48.689> still<00:01:49.259> a

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:49.289 
it's it's partly because it's still a

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:54.559 
it's it's partly because it's still a
relatively<00:01:49.799> new<00:01:50.039> trail<00:01:50.340> I<00:01:51.409> prefer<00:01:52.789> oops<00:01:53.789> that

00:01:54.559 --> 00:01:54.569 
relatively new trail I prefer oops that

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:57.109 
relatively new trail I prefer oops that
are<00:01:54.719> still<00:01:54.959> fairly<00:01:55.590> undeveloped<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.610> wild

are still fairly undeveloped and wild

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.899 
are still fairly undeveloped and wild
it's<00:01:57.840> why<00:01:58.110> I've<00:01:58.950> lived<00:01:59.159> on<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.429> Appalachian

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
Trail good something I might do it one

Trail good something I might do it one
year<00:02:01.729> but<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.849> fact<00:02:03.030> that<00:02:03.149> it's<00:02:03.360> so<00:02:03.450> well

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
year but the fact that it's so well

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.859 
year but the fact that it's so well
developed<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:05.009> blaze<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.640> whole<00:02:05.849> way<00:02:06.090> with<00:02:06.599> so

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
developed to blaze the whole way with so

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.729 
developed to blaze the whole way with so
many<00:02:06.929> facilities<00:02:07.380> has<00:02:07.890> actually<00:02:08.250> put<00:02:08.729> me<00:02:08.880> off

Pacific so I use that as a guideline I
work<00:02:44.100> for<00:02:44.130> any<00:02:44.489> obligation<00:02:45.389> to<00:02:45.989> try<00:02:46.200> and

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
planning is first of all you work out

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.809 
planning is first of all you work out
how<00:03:35.840> long<00:03:36.019> is<00:03:36.139> it<00:03:36.200> gonna<00:03:36.349> take<00:03:36.470> and<00:03:37.099> then<00:03:37.670> it's

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:37.819 
how long is it gonna take and then it's

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:40.479 
how long is it gonna take and then it's
just<00:03:38.019> where<00:03:39.019> are<00:03:39.260> the<00:03:39.530> resupply<00:03:39.920> profits

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
just where are the resupply profits

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.369 
just where are the resupply profits
because<00:03:41.150> obviously<00:03:41.359> with<00:03:41.780> the<00:03:41.810> twelve

00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:42.379 
because obviously with the twelve

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:44.349 
because obviously with the twelve
hundred<00:03:42.500> mile<00:03:42.829> walk<00:03:43.040> you're<00:03:43.669> not<00:03:43.849> gonna<00:03:44.030> carry

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:44.359 
hundred mile walk you're not gonna carry

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:45.970 
hundred mile walk you're not gonna carry
everything<00:03:44.870> Nick<00:03:45.260> from<00:03:45.500> the<00:03:45.590> beginning

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
everything Nick from the beginning

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.789 
everything Nick from the beginning
people<00:03:46.659> what's<00:03:47.659> the<00:03:47.840> distance<00:03:48.169> between<00:03:48.379> them

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
people what's the distance between them

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:50.500 
people what's the distance between them
so<00:03:49.069> how<00:03:49.189> much<00:03:49.370> foods<00:03:49.669> will<00:03:49.849> need<00:03:50.000> for<00:03:50.180> each<00:03:50.239> one

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
so how much foods will need for each one

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.369 
so how much foods will need for each one
and<00:03:50.540> also<00:03:51.109> with<00:03:52.010> the<00:03:52.129> resupply<00:03:52.459> points<00:03:53.349> can<00:03:54.349> i

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:54.379 
and also with the resupply points can i

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:57.429 
and also with the resupply points can i
buy<00:03:54.620> everything<00:03:54.769> I<00:03:55.069> need<00:03:55.280> there<00:03:55.599> or<00:03:56.599> do<00:03:57.230> I<00:03:57.290> he'd

buy everything I need there or do I he'd

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:00.550 
buy everything I need there or do I he'd
send<00:03:57.799> supplies<00:03:58.669> in<00:03:59.060> advance<00:03:59.389> because<00:03:59.659> there

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
send supplies in advance because there

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.470 
send supplies in advance because there
wasn't<00:04:00.709> nothing<00:04:00.980> there<00:04:01.189> but<00:04:01.340> a<00:04:01.579> post<00:04:02.269> office

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
than us that long so that that's the

than us that long so that that's the
main<00:04:05.750> plan<00:04:06.049> the<00:04:06.650> roots<00:04:06.859> in<00:04:07.040> between<00:04:07.489> I<00:04:08.299> still

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
main plan the roots in between I still

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.649 
main plan the roots in between I still
see<00:04:08.959> as<00:04:09.079> I<00:04:09.199> go<00:04:09.349> along<00:04:09.489> so<00:04:10.489> how<00:04:10.729> long<00:04:10.790> are<00:04:11.329> you

00:04:11.649 --> 00:04:11.659 
see as I go along so how long are you

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:15.039 
see as I go along so how long are you
planning<00:04:11.690> this<00:04:12.199> it<00:04:12.349> will<00:04:12.470> take<00:04:12.680> you<00:04:14.049> it's

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
planning this it will take you it's

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:18.520 
planning this it will take you it's
going<00:04:15.349> to<00:04:15.409> take<00:04:15.680> up<00:04:16.489> to<00:04:16.849> 75<00:04:17.539> days<00:04:17.840> probably

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
going to take up to 75 days probably

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.780 
going to take up to 75 days probably
less

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:21.790 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.870 

again<00:04:22.690> little<00:04:23.140> depends<00:04:24.130> on<00:04:24.310> the<00:04:24.430> exact<00:04:24.670> route

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
again little depends on the exact route

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.760 
again little depends on the exact route
I<00:04:25.060> choose<00:04:25.390> and<00:04:25.660> what<00:04:25.750> it's<00:04:25.930> like<00:04:26.110> there<00:04:26.620> are

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
I choose and what it's like there are

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.590 
I choose and what it's like there are
some<00:04:26.980> sections<00:04:27.550> which<00:04:27.880> are<00:04:28.030> on<00:04:28.240> you<00:04:28.540> know

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
some sections which are on you know

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.190 
some sections which are on you know
Horace<00:04:28.960> roads<00:04:29.260> and<00:04:30.220> tracks<00:04:30.930> where<00:04:31.930> I<00:04:31.960> will

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
Horace roads and tracks where I will

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.050 
Horace roads and tracks where I will
probably<00:04:32.500> be<00:04:32.590> able<00:04:32.740> to<00:04:32.830> do<00:04:32.950> you<00:04:33.220> know<00:04:33.340> 25<00:04:33.790> miles

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
probably be able to do you know 25 miles

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.840 
probably be able to do you know 25 miles
a<00:04:34.180> day<00:04:34.920> there<00:04:35.920> are<00:04:36.010> other<00:04:36.100> sections<00:04:36.640> which

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
a day there are other sections which

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.270 
a day there are other sections which
across<00:04:37.150> country<00:04:37.570> where<00:04:38.260> 10<00:04:38.860> miles<00:04:39.100> a<00:04:39.250> day

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
across country where 10 miles a day

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.160 
across country where 10 miles a day
might<00:04:39.670> need<00:04:39.910> a<00:04:40.620> good<00:04:41.620> distance<00:04:42.930> how<00:04:43.930> much<00:04:44.140> of

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.170 
might need a good distance how much of

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:47.220 
might need a good distance how much of
each<00:04:44.410> dollar<00:04:44.830> I'll<00:04:45.160> see<00:04:45.490> and<00:04:46.480> what<00:04:46.750> will<00:04:47.020> be

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:47.230 
each dollar I'll see and what will be

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.260 
each dollar I'll see and what will be
the<00:04:47.470> greatest<00:04:47.680> distance<00:04:48.250> between<00:04:48.730> supply

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
the greatest distance between supply

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:54.390 
the greatest distance between supply
points<00:04:49.720> ah<00:04:50.850> it<00:04:51.850> looks<00:04:51.910> like<00:04:52.620> being<00:04:53.620> that<00:04:54.160> game

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
points ah it looks like being that game

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.340 
points ah it looks like being that game
depending<00:04:54.880> on<00:04:55.000> the<00:04:55.120> exact<00:04:55.450> road<00:04:55.780> but<00:04:56.620> 120<00:04:57.490> to

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
depending on the exact road but 120 to

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:02.520 
depending on the exact road but 120 to
150<00:04:59.350> miles<00:04:59.590> so<00:05:00.280> roughly<00:05:01.180> a<00:05:01.300> week<00:05:01.390> I<00:05:01.900> mean

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 
150 miles so roughly a week I mean

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.140 
150 miles so roughly a week I mean
ideally<00:05:02.950> I<00:05:03.130> would<00:05:03.250> like<00:05:03.400> not<00:05:03.730> to<00:05:03.790> have<00:05:03.940> to

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
ideally I would like not to have to

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:05.790 
ideally I would like not to have to
carry<00:05:04.300> more<00:05:04.570> and<00:05:04.720> more<00:05:04.840> weeks<00:05:04.990> food<00:05:05.530> at<00:05:05.680> the

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
carry more and more weeks food at the

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.600 
carry more and more weeks food at the
time<00:05:06.300> so<00:05:07.300> obviously<00:05:07.960> not<00:05:08.380> everybody<00:05:08.800> could<00:05:09.430> do

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
time so obviously not everybody could do

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.210 
time so obviously not everybody could do

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.220 
the Pacific Northwest trail does it take

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:13.890 
the Pacific Northwest trail does it take
a<00:05:12.250> certain<00:05:12.700> sort<00:05:12.850> of<00:05:12.940> personality<00:05:13.690> and<00:05:13.720> what

a certain sort of personality and what

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.630 
a certain sort of personality and what
skills<00:05:14.200> does<00:05:14.500> it<00:05:14.650> take<00:05:14.860> to<00:05:14.890> do<00:05:15.220> something<00:05:15.610> like

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:15.640 
skills does it take to do something like

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.800 
skills does it take to do something like
this<00:05:16.380> if<00:05:17.380> you<00:05:17.830> do<00:05:18.190> it<00:05:18.340> on<00:05:18.880> your<00:05:18.940> own<00:05:19.240> which<00:05:19.660> I

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.810 
this if you do it on your own which I

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.370 
this if you do it on your own which I
generally<00:05:20.230> do<00:05:20.380> I<00:05:20.590> think<00:05:21.070> the<00:05:21.160> main<00:05:21.400> thing<00:05:21.430> is

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
generally do I think the main thing is

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.480 
generally do I think the main thing is
you<00:05:23.380> have<00:05:23.410> to<00:05:23.650> be<00:05:23.770> happy<00:05:23.920> with<00:05:24.100> your<00:05:24.370> own

have a lot to meeting places and travel
with<00:05:48.460> other<00:05:48.610> people<00:05:49.030> I<00:05:49.210> think<00:05:49.990> that's<00:05:50.140> the

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320 
with other people I think that's the

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.160 
with other people I think that's the
main<00:05:50.470> thing<00:05:50.530> I<00:05:50.890> don't<00:05:51.550> think<00:05:51.990> you<00:05:52.990> have<00:05:53.140> to

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:53.170 
main thing I don't think you have to

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:54.750 
main thing I don't think you have to
really<00:05:53.470> want<00:05:53.590> to<00:05:53.860> do<00:05:53.980> it<00:05:54.130> that's<00:05:54.370> the<00:05:54.550> thing

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:54.760 
really want to do it that's the thing

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.070 
really want to do it that's the thing
you<00:05:54.820> have<00:05:54.940> to<00:05:54.970> have<00:05:55.120> two<00:05:55.240> drives<00:05:55.480> to<00:05:55.810> it

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 
you have to have two drives to it

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.100 
you have to have two drives to it
I<00:05:57.169> don't<00:05:57.919> think<00:05:58.069> the<00:05:58.159> skills<00:05:58.780> you<00:05:59.780> know<00:05:59.900> of

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:00.110 
I don't think the skills you know of

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.649 
I don't think the skills you know of
that<00:06:00.289> significant<00:06:00.949> in<00:06:01.099> that<00:06:01.129> any<00:06:01.659> competent

00:06:02.649 --> 00:06:02.659 
that significant in that any competent

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:04.689 
that significant in that any competent
he'll<00:06:02.900> water<00:06:03.139> in<00:06:03.319> the<00:06:03.409> UK<00:06:03.770> could<00:06:04.310> do<00:06:04.460> one<00:06:04.669> of

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:04.699 
he'll water in the UK could do one of

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:08.619 
he'll water in the UK could do one of
these<00:06:04.849> trails<00:06:05.210> in<00:06:05.840> a<00:06:06.800> lot<00:06:07.039> of<00:06:07.069> ways<00:06:07.400> the<00:06:08.240> tzo

00:06:08.619 --> 00:06:08.629 
these trails in a lot of ways the tzo

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:11.080 
these trails in a lot of ways the tzo
challenge<00:06:09.169> is<00:06:09.379> tougher<00:06:09.740> than<00:06:09.819> any<00:06:10.819> of<00:06:10.969> these

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.090 
challenge is tougher than any of these

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:14.709 
challenge is tougher than any of these
trails<00:06:12.099> because<00:06:13.099> you're<00:06:13.699> mostly<00:06:14.030> on<00:06:14.180> much

00:06:14.709 --> 00:06:14.719 
trails because you're mostly on much

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:18.429

00:06:32.589 --> 00:06:32.599 
well think all the American trails if

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:35.469 
well think all the American trails if
the<00:06:32.810> weather<00:06:32.990> is<00:06:33.139> bad<00:06:33.909> you<00:06:34.909> can<00:06:35.090> get<00:06:35.210> shelter

00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:35.479 
the weather is bad you can get shelter

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:37.899 
the weather is bad you can get shelter
you<00:06:36.319> can<00:06:36.500> drop<00:06:36.650> down<00:06:36.860> into<00:06:37.099> the<00:06:37.219> into<00:06:37.819> the

00:06:37.899 --> 00:06:37.909 
you can drop down into the into the

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:40.170 
you can drop down into the into the
forest<00:06:38.270> so<00:06:38.810> in<00:06:38.930> that<00:06:39.020> sense<00:06:39.259> they're<00:06:39.590> easier

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:40.180 
forest so in that sense they're easier

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:43.360 
forest so in that sense they're easier
and<00:06:41.259> obviously<00:06:42.259> the<00:06:42.379> more<00:06:42.500> popular<00:06:43.009> one<00:06:43.159> was
