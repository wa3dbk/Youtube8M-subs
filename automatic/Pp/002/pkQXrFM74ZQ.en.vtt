that's<00:05:37.060> it<00:05:37.330> now<00:05:37.569> I<00:05:37.900> love<00:05:38.259> this<00:05:38.379> icing<00:05:38.770> because

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:38.889 
that's it now I love this icing because

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:41.100 
that's it now I love this icing because
it<00:05:39.129> actually<00:05:39.370> does<00:05:39.879> get<00:05:40.180> a<00:05:40.210> little<00:05:40.599> bit<00:05:40.719> step

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
it actually does get a little bit step

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.409 
it actually does get a little bit step
so<00:05:41.889> it<00:05:42.069> doesn't<00:05:42.370> stay<00:05:42.550> soft

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:43.419 
so it doesn't stay soft

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:46.439 
so it doesn't stay soft
so<00:05:43.719> these<00:05:43.900> cookies<00:05:44.349> um<00:05:44.680> can't<00:05:45.669> travel<00:05:46.089> well<00:05:46.270> if

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:46.449
