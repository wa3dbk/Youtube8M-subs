00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:11.070
 These are 2 eyes and lights in the English peephole 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.830
 now just dimensions are burning without 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.570
 dim light lens here 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.570
 there is usually a halogen 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.789
 then of course difficult to see but there is and 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.230
 there is a gap when installing 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:31.079
 to avoid it you just need to lower 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.110
 mounts a little bit to drill 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:36.989
 and adjust the installation of the headlamp 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.949
 everything will be fine now turn on 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.949
 dipped beam 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:56.590
 It is worth the standard halogen lamp which 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.590
 plant year 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.510
 like that found something shining 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:17.200
 Now in the mode of turn signals and distant 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.200
 right away 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:30.870
 that is, it is clear that the lens 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:32.280
 same shine gave them and accordingly 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:36.049
 distant 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.049
 two genks are also very bright 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.120
 now including again too dimensions 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.790
 We look as the LED tape burns 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.020
 from different angles it glows 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.020
 differently then there is a man right then 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.600
 shines like a continuous band 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:13.960
 but if you look closely, you can see that 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.880
 it is worth individual LEDs that 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:22.430
 just reflected in all directions effect 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:25.310
 such a flat band this morning 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:29.090
 specifically became opposite to the sun 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:34.360
 light and today was a cloudless dawn 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:36.920
 and looked like the color will be 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:40.190
 in bright sunny weather and tell you 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:43.910
 that she is very bright that is possible 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.850
 use as easily boldly that is 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.080
 in the daytime there is no dim light that is 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:53.300
 separately angel eyes 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:56.900
 diode strip audi 100 but in principle 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:59.800
 the whole review about these lights and if something 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.950
 it was unclear how to write call all 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.950
 bye everyone
