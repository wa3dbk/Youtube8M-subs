00:00:00.876 --> 00:00:04.087
 By popular demand, Screen Junkies present 

00:00:04.087 --> 00:00:07.424
 honest trailer that may contain spoilers. 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.222
 Meet the brand new sequel to restart the franchise, 

00:00:13.222 --> 00:00:16.642
 which is based on the sequel of the film from the original franchise. 

00:00:16.892 --> 00:00:19.186
 "STARRY WAY TO DARKNESS" 

00:00:19.436 --> 00:00:21.855
 Um, colon nobody forgot? 

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:24.983
 Get ready for a sequel about which JJ Abrams swore 

00:00:24.983 --> 00:00:27.861
 that he won't be like Star Trek 2: Khan's Wrath. 

00:00:28.153 --> 00:00:29.530
 Well, except for this moment: 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:30.739
 "Most needs 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:32.328
 more important than minority needs. " 

00:00:32.328 --> 00:00:33.534
 And this 

00:00:33.909 --> 00:00:34.868
 And of course ... 

00:00:35.452 --> 00:00:37.996
 "HAAAN!" 

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:40.415
 "Haaan!" - this. 

00:00:41.292 --> 00:00:44.312
 But JJ is not only stealing scenes from Wrath of the Khan, 

00:00:44.312 --> 00:00:48.102
 he also re-uses everything that you liked in his Star Trek. 

00:00:48.102 --> 00:00:49.016
 For example: 

00:00:49.016 --> 00:00:50.634
 Kirk in bed with aliens 

00:00:50.634 --> 00:00:52.177
 Spock in fits of anger 

00:00:52.427 --> 00:00:54.096
 Kirk and Pike are drinking 

00:00:54.096 --> 00:00:55.848
 Red Bull jumps from space 

00:00:55.848 --> 00:00:57.307
 Running through the corridors 

00:00:57.307 --> 00:00:58.433
 Old Spock 

00:00:58.725 --> 00:00:59.601
 AND... 

00:00:59.601 --> 00:01:00.352
 EVEN 

00:01:00.352 --> 00:01:01.520
 MORE 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.813
 BIN OF LENSES! 

00:01:11.864 --> 00:01:13.365
 Um, well, well, you understand. 

00:01:13.365 --> 00:01:16.326
 So again ride with James T. Kirk, 

00:01:16.326 --> 00:01:20.414
 the worst captain of Starfleet in the entire galaxy who 

00:01:20.414 --> 00:01:22.421
 defiles the gods of other civilizations 

00:01:22.421 --> 00:01:23.807
 "" What the hell are you saying? " 

00:01:23.807 --> 00:01:25.711
 "-I do not know, but they bowed to him!" 

00:01:25.878 --> 00:01:28.755
 lets experienced crew members out of malice 

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:30.883
 "-So you accept my resignation or not?" 

00:01:30.883 --> 00:01:31.842
 "-I accept!" 

00:01:31.842 --> 00:01:35.137
 Increases inexperienced crew members tucked under the arm 

00:01:35.137 --> 00:01:36.229
 "-Will be the chief engineer." 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:37.228
 "-I have, captain." 

00:01:37.228 --> 00:01:39.575
 And fails to protect his crew 

00:01:40.893 --> 00:01:42.186
 ... and the Enterprise 

00:01:43.498 --> 00:01:45.230
 ... and the center of San Francisco. 

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:52.444
 Dejectedly watch the stereotypical image of the two main female characters: 

00:01:52.444 --> 00:01:56.909
 Uhura, usually a competent officer, interrupts a deadly mission, 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.398
 to drank his boyfriend for not sharing his feelings. 

00:01:59.398 --> 00:02:01.246
 "You prefer not to discuss it at all." 

00:02:01.246 --> 00:02:02.748
 "Are you going to find out the relationship now?" 

00:02:02.748 --> 00:02:06.251
 "-And never pay your undivided attention ... Sorry, Captain, a couple of seconds." 

00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:10.756
 And newcomer Carol Marcus, who is in the film for the sole reason 

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:12.049
 "Turn away." 

00:02:12.257 --> 00:02:13.800
 We count as two reasons. 

00:02:14.051 --> 00:02:18.098
 See how this crew is confronted by their most dangerous adversary: 

00:02:18.098 --> 00:02:19.139
 "Han!" 

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:20.682
 This is a ruthless villain. 

00:02:20.682 --> 00:02:22.184
 "So, let's start?" 

00:02:22.184 --> 00:02:24.520
 So inhuman that ... 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.812
 won't kill Spock 

00:02:26.855 --> 00:02:29.233
 allow Kirk to express his feelings 

00:02:30.692 --> 00:02:34.363
 and ultimately it will be completely justified in their actions: 

00:02:34.363 --> 00:02:36.823
 "My crew is my family." 

00:02:36.823 --> 00:02:40.661
 "Wouldn't you have done anything for your family?" 

00:02:40.661 --> 00:02:42.663
 Admittedly, the argument is strong. 

00:02:42.663 --> 00:02:47.960
 So feel free to go to this ridiculous temporary branch of "Star Trek", in which: 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.130
 "Enterprise" withstands more hits than he took for the entire original series 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.215
 Against the backdrop of magical interplanetary transporters spacecraft seem antiquity 

00:02:56.215 --> 00:02:58.929
 Death is cured by magical super blood. 

00:02:58.929 --> 00:03:01.723
 "I synthesized a serum from his super blood." 

00:03:01.723 --> 00:03:06.436
 And whenever they fall into a space jam, the old Spock webcam file 

00:03:06.436 --> 00:03:08.772
 "- Mr. Spock. - Mr. Spock." 

00:03:08.772 --> 00:03:12.109
 Oh, I already imagine what the next Star Trek will be. 

00:03:13.485 --> 00:03:18.907
 "Klingon General Cheng, Horta, Tolians, Borg. ALL VERY BAD !!!" 

00:03:18.907 --> 00:03:20.909
 Who else should we beware of? 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:22.452
 Did we go through Gorn? 

00:03:22.452 --> 00:03:25.414
 Yes. This is just a test. The horn does not kill. 

00:03:25.414 --> 00:03:31.670
 Right. Oh, and when you return to New York in the 1930s, you must kill the girl Kirk, 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.548
 otherwise, Hitler will win World War II. 

00:03:34.548 --> 00:03:35.433
 How interesting. 

00:03:35.433 --> 00:03:41.430
 Oh, and at the same time hunt down a pair of humpback whales: this will save you a lot of time later. 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.931
 Gory-baty Ki-you. 

00:03:42.931 --> 00:03:47.186
 Well, sort of, that's all. And now, I suppose you have something for me. 

00:03:47.811 --> 00:03:49.104
 A NEW MESSAGE! 

00:03:50.606 --> 00:03:52.316
 Well here is lucky! 

00:03:52.316 --> 00:03:56.612
 The best thing I got was that weird dance in Star Trek 5. 

00:03:56.612 --> 00:04:00.449
 Will we definitely not break any space-time continuum? 

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:03.035
 Hey! Want me to help, or not ?! 

00:04:03.635 --> 00:04:04.703
 CAST... 

00:04:04.707 --> 00:04:06.183
 CAPTAIN FURK 

00:04:06.183 --> 00:04:07.080
 SCOOP 

00:04:07.247 --> 00:04:08.614
 OLD SOVOK 

00:04:08.614 --> 00:04:10.042
 MARGARET CHO 

00:04:10.042 --> 00:04:11.585
 CARLOS SANTANA 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.097
 DOCTOR, NOT A MIRACLE 

00:04:14.296 --> 00:04:15.589
 Blingo 

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:17.174
 SCOTT NAME ENGINEER 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:18.467

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:19.966
 FRAME TO SCREEN 

00:04:19.966 --> 00:04:22.471
 AND BENEDICT CAMBERBAND EGGS 

00:04:22.638 --> 00:04:25.516
 "STARRY WAY TO DARKNESS" 

00:04:25.516 --> 00:04:28.060
 Let's definitely not put a colon?

00:04:53.043 --> 00:04:55.170
 "Nadu ass, Cbass!" 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:56.880
 "Go quiet." 

00:04:57.339 --> 00:04:59.174
 "Haaan!"
