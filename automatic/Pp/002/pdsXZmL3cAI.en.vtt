this<00:03:19.440> is<00:03:19.650> an<00:03:19.800> example<00:03:20.160> of<00:03:20.849> a<00:03:21.000> picture<00:03:21.150> quality

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
this is an example of a picture quality

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.750 
this is an example of a picture quality
with<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:22.050> infrared<00:03:22.380> lights<00:03:22.739> turned<00:03:23.220> off<00:03:23.430> and

with the infrared lights turned off and

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.510 
with the infrared lights turned off and
in<00:03:24.030> a<00:03:24.150> complete<00:03:24.510> dark<00:03:24.750> environment

in a complete dark environment

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.040 
in a complete dark environment
now<00:03:26.520> the<00:03:26.580> infrared<00:03:27.120> lights<00:03:27.360> are<00:03:27.599> switched<00:03:27.720> on

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
now the infrared lights are switched on

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.540 
now the infrared lights are switched on
to<00:03:28.440> show<00:03:28.620> you<00:03:28.680> how<00:03:28.860> much<00:03:28.980> difference<00:03:29.400> they

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
to show you how much difference they

00:03:29.550 --> 00:04:18.909 
to show you how much difference they
make

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:23.150 

this<00:04:19.919> is<00:04:20.389> emptying<00:04:21.389> the<00:04:21.570> tank<00:04:21.840> out<00:04:22.160> the

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
this is emptying the tank out the

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.879 
this is emptying the tank out the
fertilizers<00:04:23.790> been<00:04:24.000> in<00:04:24.120> quite<00:04:24.570> a<00:04:24.600> while<00:04:24.900> so

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:25.889 
fertilizers been in quite a while so

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:28.280 
fertilizers been in quite a while so
therefore<00:04:26.430> it<00:04:26.669> is<00:04:26.820> bridged<00:04:27.150> it<00:04:27.660> got<00:04:27.870> wet<00:04:28.110> at

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
therefore it is bridged it got wet at

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:29.980 
therefore it is bridged it got wet at
some<00:04:28.500> time

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
some time

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:44.510 
some time
this<00:04:30.260> is<00:04:30.410> how<00:04:30.560> clear<00:04:30.950> the<00:04:31.130> picture<00:04:31.520> is

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.550 

that<00:04:44.910> was<00:04:45.150> them<00:04:45.330> getting<00:04:45.660> the<00:04:45.810> canola<00:04:46.169> tank

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
that was them getting the canola tank

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.469 
that was them getting the canola tank
the<00:04:47.460> front<00:04:47.759> tank<00:04:48.030> and<00:04:49.580> it's<00:04:50.580> very<00:04:50.819> easy<00:04:51.060> to<00:04:51.210> see

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:51.479 
the front tank and it's very easy to see

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:53.059 
the front tank and it's very easy to see
when<00:04:51.690> you<00:04:51.780> get<00:04:51.900> down<00:04:52.050> to<00:04:52.110> a<00:04:52.349> cup<00:04:52.560> full<00:04:52.740> or<00:04:52.889> two

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:53.069 
when you get down to a cup full or two

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:55.279 
when you get down to a cup full or two
of<00:04:53.220> seed<00:04:53.460> it<00:04:54.360> just<00:04:54.629> shows<00:04:54.870> it<00:04:55.050> so<00:04:55.229> you

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:55.289 
of seed it just shows it so you

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:57.649 
of seed it just shows it so you
shouldn't<00:04:56.069> have<00:04:56.190> to<00:04:56.310> open<00:04:56.669> any<00:04:56.849> more<00:04:57.060> bags<00:04:57.330> and

00:04:57.649 --> 00:04:57.659 
shouldn't have to open any more bags and

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:00.349 
shouldn't have to open any more bags and
absolutely<00:04:58.080> necessary
