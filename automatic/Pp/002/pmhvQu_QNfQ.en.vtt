way shape and form you want to look at

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.460 
way shape and form you want to look at
it<00:00:23.850> so<00:00:24.779> you<00:00:24.810> need<00:00:24.960> to<00:00:25.019> be<00:00:25.080> able<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.230> figure<00:00:25.350> how

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
it so you need to be able to figure how

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.650 
it so you need to be able to figure how
to<00:00:25.500> express<00:00:25.830> that<00:00:26.330> technique<00:00:27.330> is<00:00:27.449> very

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
to express that technique is very

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.689 
to express that technique is very
important<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.080> that<00:00:28.230> but<00:00:28.890> it's<00:00:29.130> also<00:00:29.310> finding

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
important to that but it's also finding

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.759 
important to that but it's also finding
what<00:00:30.119> inside<00:00:30.660> that<00:00:30.869> person<00:00:31.260> made<00:00:31.439> them<00:00:31.590> want

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769
