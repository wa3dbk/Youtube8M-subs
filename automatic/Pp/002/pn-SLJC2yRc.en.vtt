is about 50% dry right now I just
finished<00:00:09.000> a<00:00:09.360> strong<00:00:10.230> protein<00:00:10.860> treatment<00:00:11.429> and

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
finished a strong protein treatment and

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.740 
finished a strong protein treatment and
I<00:00:12.389> wanted<00:00:12.780> to<00:00:12.900> share<00:00:13.139> it<00:00:13.290> with<00:00:13.320> all<00:00:13.740> of<00:00:13.769> you

Alpha G two-step protein treatment I'm

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.569 
Alpha G two-step protein treatment I'm
going<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.410> walk<00:00:55.590> you<00:00:55.770> through<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:56.190> show<00:00:56.520> you

going to walk you through it show you
how<00:00:56.820> I<00:00:56.879> do<00:00:57.059> it<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:58.039> I<00:00:59.039> hope<00:00:59.489> that<00:00:59.940> answers<00:01:00.390> all

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
how I do it and I hope that answers all

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.789 
how I do it and I hope that answers all
of<00:01:00.660> your<00:01:00.809> questions<00:01:00.960> this<00:01:01.800> is<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.510> hardcore

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:03.799 
of your questions this is a hardcore

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:07.310 
of your questions this is a hardcore
protein<00:01:04.799> treatment<00:01:05.460> if<00:01:05.700> your<00:01:06.600> hair<00:01:06.990> is

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
protein treatment if your hair is

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.270 
protein treatment if your hair is
extremely<00:01:07.950> damaged<00:01:08.430> if<00:01:08.960> you<00:01:09.960> are<00:01:10.710> chemically

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
extremely damaged if you are chemically

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.130 
extremely damaged if you are chemically
treated<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.030> when<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.150> say<00:01:12.360> chemically<00:01:12.810> treat

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
treated and when I say chemically treat

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.450 
treated and when I say chemically treat
that<00:01:13.350> can<00:01:13.530> be<00:01:13.650> relaxer<00:01:14.509> texturizer<00:01:15.560> or<00:01:16.560> color

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
that can be relaxer texturizer or color

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.039 
that can be relaxer texturizer or color
so<00:01:17.850> you<00:01:17.909> can<00:01:18.000> be<00:01:18.210> natural<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:18.689> have<00:01:18.840> hair

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
so you can be natural and have hair

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.899 
so you can be natural and have hair
color<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:19.530> are<00:01:19.650> still<00:01:19.890> chemically<00:01:20.430> treated

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
color you are still chemically treated

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.539 
color you are still chemically treated
Naturals<00:01:21.450> will<00:01:21.960> not<00:01:22.170> need<00:01:22.409> as<00:01:22.710> much<00:01:22.770> protein

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
Naturals will not need as much protein

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.330 
Naturals will not need as much protein
as<00:01:23.900> chemically<00:01:24.900> treated<00:01:25.320> ladies<00:01:25.710> unless<00:01:26.189> you

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
as chemically treated ladies unless you

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.210 
as chemically treated ladies unless you
use<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.520> lot<00:01:26.759> of<00:01:26.790> heat<00:01:27.030> that's<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.110> thing<00:01:28.320> when

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
use a lot of heat that's the thing when

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.310 
use a lot of heat that's the thing when
we<00:01:29.369> process<00:01:29.880> our<00:01:30.060> hair<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.689> strips<00:01:31.079> out<00:01:31.200> the

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
we process our hair it strips out the

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.620 
we process our hair it strips out the
natural<00:01:32.159> protein<00:01:32.579> in<00:01:32.759> our<00:01:32.850> hair<00:01:33.090> so<00:01:33.299> our<00:01:33.390> hair

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
natural protein in our hair so our hair

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.289 
natural protein in our hair so our hair
can<00:01:33.840> begin<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.290> get<00:01:34.470> damaged<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.220> if<00:01:36.119> your

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
can begin to get damaged and if your
