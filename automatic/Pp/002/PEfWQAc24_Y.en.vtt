00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.270 
so a players worth apparently 17 million
for<00:02:39.959> four<00:02:40.170> mil<00:02:40.380> that<00:02:40.920> would<00:02:41.010> be<00:02:41.100> some

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
for four mil that would be some

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.920 
for four mil that would be some
incredible<00:02:41.760> business<00:02:41.940> and<00:02:42.239> Arsenal<00:02:42.570> doona<00:02:42.810> to

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
incredible business and Arsenal doona to

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.030 
incredible business and Arsenal doona to
kind<00:02:43.200> of<00:02:43.230> get<00:02:43.350> some<00:02:43.500> more<00:02:43.590> depth<00:02:43.800> in<00:02:43.890> their

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
kind of get some more depth in their

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.130 
kind of get some more depth in their
attacking<00:02:44.280> line<00:02:44.550> because<00:02:45.180> if<00:02:45.720> a<00:02:45.870> player<00:02:46.050> is

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
attacking line because if a player is

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.810 
attacking line because if a player is
injured<00:02:46.350> like<00:02:46.560> Walcott<00:02:47.010> then<00:02:47.400> they<00:02:47.489> have<00:02:47.670> no

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
injured like Walcott then they have no

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.310 
injured like Walcott then they have no
kind<00:02:48.030> of<00:02:48.120> backup<00:02:48.330> for<00:02:48.630> that<00:02:48.660> but<00:02:48.900> Carl<00:02:49.110> severe

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
kind of backup for that but Carl severe

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.870 
kind of backup for that but Carl severe
can<00:02:49.500> play<00:02:49.620> down<00:02:49.739> the<00:02:49.830> middle<00:02:50.010> so<00:02:50.459> if<00:02:50.520> she<00:02:50.640> was

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
can play down the middle so if she was

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:51.979 
can play down the middle so if she was
playing<00:02:51.090> bad<00:02:51.300> you<00:02:51.450> could<00:02:51.570> stick<00:02:51.720> him<00:02:51.810> down<00:02:51.930> the

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
playing bad you could stick him down the

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.890 
playing bad you could stick him down the
middle<00:02:52.110> school<00:02:52.530> you<00:02:52.620> go<00:02:52.830> and<00:02:53.450> he<00:02:54.450> did<00:02:54.630> once

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
would never return back to arsenal but I

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.470 
would never return back to arsenal but I
think<00:02:59.040> now<00:02:59.220> apparent<00:02:59.610> ease<00:02:59.700> back<00:02:59.820> to<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.150> open

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
think now apparent ease back to the open

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.330 
think now apparent ease back to the open
to<00:03:00.780> move<00:03:00.959> again<00:03:01.230> but<00:03:01.680> like<00:03:01.800> I<00:03:01.830> said<00:03:01.980> I<00:03:02.100> reckon

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
to move again but like I said I reckon

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.500 
to move again but like I said I reckon
I'd<00:03:02.459> be<00:03:02.519> a<00:03:02.580> great<00:03:02.850> great<00:03:03.000> piece<00:03:03.239> of<00:03:03.269> business

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
I'd be a great great piece of business

that<00:03:46.470> kind<00:03:46.799> of<00:03:46.829> counts<00:03:47.280> towards<00:03:47.670> as<00:03:47.760> well<00:03:47.940> guys

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
that kind of counts towards as well guys

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.030 
that kind of counts towards as well guys
so<00:03:48.329> we're<00:03:48.480> still<00:03:49.079> have<00:03:49.170> quite<00:03:49.500> a<00:03:49.560> few<00:03:49.680> assist

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:01.670 
potentially going to real madrid and i
don't<00:04:00.570> think<00:04:00.660> it's<00:04:00.870> one<00:04:00.989> is<00:04:01.140> good<00:04:01.350> to<00:04:01.500> happen

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
don't think it's one is good to happen

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.740 
don't think it's one is good to happen
and<00:04:02.070> last<00:04:02.549> season<00:04:02.850> it<00:04:02.970> looked<00:04:03.120> very<00:04:03.329> very<00:04:03.510> very

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
and last season it looked very very very

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.110 
and last season it looked very very very
likely<00:04:04.049> but<00:04:04.920> somehow<00:04:05.130> little<00:04:05.519> much<00:04:05.640> keep<00:04:05.910> hold

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
likely but somehow little much keep hold

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.270 
likely but somehow little much keep hold
of<00:04:06.239> him<00:04:06.360> and<00:04:06.540> he's<00:04:07.380> actually<00:04:07.560> been<00:04:07.769> quoted<00:04:08.160> to

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
of him and he's actually been quoted to

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.310 
of him and he's actually been quoted to
saying<00:04:08.519> that<00:04:08.910> it's<00:04:09.360> just<00:04:09.450> speculation<00:04:09.780> that

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
saying that it's just speculation that

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.900 
saying that it's just speculation that
you<00:04:10.380> might<00:04:10.440> be<00:04:10.590> moving<00:04:10.859> he<00:04:11.160> doesn't<00:04:11.489> I<00:04:11.700> think

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
you might be moving he doesn't I think

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.090 
you might be moving he doesn't I think
he's<00:04:12.000> kind<00:04:12.209> of<00:04:12.239> like<00:04:12.440> dampened<00:04:13.440> the<00:04:13.500> whole

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
he's kind of like dampened the whole

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.219 
he's kind of like dampened the whole
speculation<00:04:14.730> of<00:04:14.790> him<00:04:14.910> leaving<00:04:15.060> so<00:04:15.450> hopefully

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
speculation of him leaving so hopefully

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:18.710 
speculation of him leaving so hopefully

suarez done the middle holy that

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:31.550 
suarez done the middle holy that
would<00:04:28.949> be<00:04:29.039> ridiculous<00:04:29.190> so<00:04:30.090> if<00:04:30.539> he<00:04:30.900> did<00:04:31.080> leave<00:04:31.289> I

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
would be ridiculous so if he did leave I

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.740 
would be ridiculous so if he did leave I
think<00:04:31.919> it<00:04:32.039> actually<00:04:32.160> like<00:04:32.699> kind<00:04:33.150> of<00:04:33.210> spur<00:04:33.449> on<00:04:33.630> a

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
think it actually like kind of spur on a

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.480 
think it actually like kind of spur on a
chain<00:04:34.020> of<00:04:34.050> other<00:04:34.289> transfers<00:04:34.800> and<00:04:35.039> all<00:04:35.400> those

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
chain of other transfers and all those

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.159 
chain of other transfers and all those
potential<00:04:35.940> chain<00:04:36.120> of<00:04:36.240> transfers<00:04:36.600> is<00:04:36.750> Karim

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
potential chain of transfers is Karim
