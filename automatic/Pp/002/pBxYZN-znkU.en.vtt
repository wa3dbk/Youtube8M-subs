 to be honest when you start 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.910

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.490
 and what outside is very light how arrives 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.620
 the bulk of the light 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.670
 behind your if I reverse that 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:32.580
 filming still images then sees 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.740
 polymer already a lot better 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.960
 they are going to make a video recording of 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.550
 themselves an interview that they make 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.770
 with a classmate 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.830
 about their hobbies and simple subject 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.900
 re where they actually have a piece 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.350
 grammar practicing the present 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.870
 simple 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.690
 Because you use that time to get over you 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:54.450
 hobbies to talk to you oh be the mine 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:57.960
 libraries and all fragments yes 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.900
 all video clips all photos and all 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.460
 music yes that I have on my ipad and 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.400
 can start using again in a montage 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.420
 and at the bottom of the search time scene where is possible 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.789
 your own those fragments by each 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.950
 go in them when you first met 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.690
 my video gets started in class 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.550
 a student with such a tablet or that 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.800
 an ipad or an android device is that 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.900
 making it then you have to do from 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.400
 that the whole of Asia is not enough 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.380
 I started with a piece of theory 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.750
 about visual language to give as you go 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.550
 filming that you are not standing upright for years 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.200
 is going to film from the TV that is also not 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.970
 can be on its own because they are one 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.950
 had to record interview 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.350
 are talking about yes what is that about 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.269
 then assemble a piece of yes 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.410
 imovie how do you do that 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:40.410
 and then they get to work 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:51.480
 mon what is your hobby is arie and things 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:56.100
 like that what's nf that you and me and 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:03:00.540
 i think i would cow this question to us 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:03.210
 and then that of normal man okay what 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.040
 and in a page answer product 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.600
 not so important this process that they 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.860
 have gone through to make that video 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.570
 then important 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.640
 they have that one voice assignment one 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.660
 number of times they have made mistakes 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.070
 made 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.720
 they have seen their own photo 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.150
 have learned to be with three 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.100
 at work and social learning 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.290
 It is also important that you see that 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.390
 students who are silent in an ordinary one 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:28.260
 so now they open flourish because they 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.280
 like this this is their thing can 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.790
 to do 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:35.840
 yes yes so all-day splits 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:41.910
 yes mister taxman that he of that it 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:43.560
 positive and I say they went in it 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.870
 make a two-minute video now 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.630
 the intention is that at the end 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.700
 from the fourth year have ipad bring 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.160
 to London and that they are out there on the street 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.470
 People are going to interview and they are small 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:58.709
 make a documentary of fifteen minutes 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.330
 if you are now in london next year 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.310
 should do interviews then you go 5 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.830
 six in go back air get 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.750
 you have such a large file in which you 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.519
 say assemble where then this is 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.590
 actually interview 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:11.700
 then you mount separately that you put on 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.110
 your film roll 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.240
 you can connect them again 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.370
 on level there is a lot for me 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.380
 time savings and if I have all those students 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.060
 one before or in groups of two 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.520
 have to place in front of the class then I am 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:27.090
 maybe two hours lost while on 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.620
 this way they are a whole lesson 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.660
 they are all working 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.510
 all talking english and i have 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:37.440
 also a product on which I can rely 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:40.670
 our base to give their score and 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:43.790
 find that like us 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:46.370
 if one is in between it can't be 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.260
 and that always exists in between 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.100
 waving doing new work is never 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.750
 disappeared 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.510
 always do n't move anymore 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:57.170
 the students were particularly surprised 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:58.490
 nice because it brings variation like any 

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.350
 teacher 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:03.500
 every speaking assignment late 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:06.050
 do after being sitting down four times 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:09.230
 they were learning with that ipad must be somewhere 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:11.710
 a more longer should be useful what 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:11.710
 they do with it
