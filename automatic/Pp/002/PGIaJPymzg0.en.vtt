00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:03.829
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.480
 Because 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.189
 Yes 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:21.189
 Eroge bran I to beans 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:21.189
 me 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.370
 I am 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.870
 have 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:10.680
 I noticed recently , but if we get caught it's 100% death penalty 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:17.340
 It is not like cheese recently 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:21.190
 For example, if it is to be judged as a national of there by taking in the secret without landform 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:24.550
 You can at least live as a prisoner . 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:28.600
 But it's not so difficult 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:31.920
 Well it's a good story 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.920
 If you try this for a moment 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.450
 It's already good 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.990
 Same type 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:47.320
 Omae is why 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:55.360
 From here, I will take a step from my territory 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:57.910
 I 'll decide what I'm going to lie in the end that cherry blossoms are actually the most hopefully this I 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.630
 White work silently by softening 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.620
 Bought also supporting role of 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.540
 What's the Koryaa 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.540
 If there is a certain gag touch or power 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:26.870
 What do you exist for me who I Metropolitan Police Department 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:29.480
 Teku or rather over I Nikki horrible existence over 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.920
 Maybe I thought so too 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:36.420
 The Metropolitan Police Department is an old Edo Castle 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:39.340
 As it is in front of Sakuradamon of the present Imperial Palace, as it is 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:44.800
 It seems that it is sometimes called Sakuradamon 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:47.860
 I know but I'm really strong I used to be assassinated a long time ago 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:51.400
 Intonation of that Sakuradamon 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:54.840
 Dare to say in's right ear of the musical scale 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.840
 I think I'll work hard 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.790
 24 remember
