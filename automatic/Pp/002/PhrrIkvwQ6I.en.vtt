so<00:00:01.740> I<00:00:01.770> will<00:00:02.250> be<00:00:02.399> using<00:00:02.639> a<00:00:03.830> gallito<00:00:05.060> 1260<00:00:06.060> to

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
so I will be using a gallito 1260 to

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:18.550 
so I will be using a gallito 1260 to
connect<00:00:07.470> to<00:00:07.620> my<00:00:08.780> 2003<00:00:09.780> a<00:00:10.820> Megan<00:00:12.380> 1.6<00:00:15.080> 16-valve

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:25.179 

engine<00:00:19.560> so<00:00:20.039> I<00:00:20.420> have<00:00:21.420> connected<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:23.269> gala<00:00:24.269> toe

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:25.189

engine so I have connected the gala toe
to<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:28.429> socket<00:00:29.429> as<00:00:29.640> you<00:00:30.179> can<00:00:31.189> hardly<00:00:32.189> see<00:00:34.040> and

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
to the socket as you can hardly see and

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.049 
to the socket as you can hardly see and
I<00:00:35.790> tried<00:00:36.540> this<00:00:37.140> connection<00:00:37.739> before<00:00:38.070> with<00:00:38.610> my

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
I tried this connection before with my

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.530 
liter 16-valve series 3rd
do<00:02:15.500> so<00:02:16.500> let's<00:02:16.770> see<00:02:17.400> if<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:17.940> software

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
do so let's see if the software

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:33.260 
do so let's see if the software
functions<00:02:19.170> I<00:02:22.370> click<00:02:23.370> on<00:02:23.640> issue<00:02:23.970> data<00:02:32.060> okay

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
functions I click on issue data okay

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.300 
functions I click on issue data okay
so<00:02:33.660> there<00:02:34.560> is<00:02:34.770> a<00:02:34.950> signal<00:02:35.580> at<00:02:35.730> least<00:02:36.030> issue<00:02:36.360> data

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
so there is a signal at least issue data

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.170 
so there is a signal at least issue data
came<00:02:38.310> on<00:02:38.490> the<00:02:38.610> screen

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
came on the screen

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.840 
came on the screen
so<00:02:40.170> during<00:02:41.010> connection<00:02:41.730> I<00:02:42.980> first<00:02:43.980> connected

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
so during connection I first connected

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:50.930 
so during connection I first connected
open<00:02:45.300> my<00:02:45.630> computer<00:02:48.500> connected<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.770> cable<00:02:50.730> to

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
open my computer connected the cable to

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:57.500 
open my computer connected the cable to
my<00:02:51.090> car<00:02:52.050> and<00:02:52.290> then<00:02:53.630> put<00:02:54.630> the<00:02:54.840> ignition<00:02:56.510> to

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
my car and then put the ignition to

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.010 
my car and then put the ignition to
second<00:02:57.960> position<00:02:58.220> so<00:02:59.220> I<00:02:59.490> didn't<00:03:00.390> start<00:03:00.690> the

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
second position so I didn't start the

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.710 
second position so I didn't start the
engine<00:03:01.350> this<00:03:01.530> is<00:03:01.650> very<00:03:01.860> critical<00:03:02.130> and<00:03:02.580> I<00:03:03.420> also

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
engine this is very critical and I also

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.530 
engine this is very critical and I also
check<00:03:04.110> the<00:03:04.260> voltage<00:03:04.410> of<00:03:04.920> my<00:03:05.550> battery<00:03:06.300> in<00:03:06.480> my

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
check the voltage of my battery in my

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.880 
check the voltage of my battery in my
car<00:03:07.200> if<00:03:08.040> it<00:03:08.310> is<00:03:08.520> enough<00:03:08.910> so<00:03:09.540> it<00:03:10.140> showed<00:03:10.590> me

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
car if it is enough so it showed me

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.350 
car if it is enough so it showed me
twelve<00:03:11.460> point<00:03:11.820> four<00:03:12.170> volt<00:03:13.170> so<00:03:14.150> that's<00:03:15.150> the

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
twelve point four volt so that's the

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.350 
twelve point four volt so that's the
conditions<00:03:15.930> I'm<00:03:16.350> trying<00:03:17.190> now<00:03:17.940> I'll<00:03:18.180> be

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
conditions I'm trying now I'll be

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.230 
conditions I'm trying now I'll be
starting<00:03:18.750> reading<00:03:19.170> to<00:03:19.560> issue<00:03:19.980> let's<00:03:20.820> see<00:03:21.060> if

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:21.240 
starting reading to issue let's see if

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:27.190 
starting reading to issue let's see if
it<00:03:21.360> will<00:03:21.570> function<00:03:24.170> so<00:03:25.170> it<00:03:25.410> asks<00:03:25.650> for<00:03:25.950> a

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
it will function so it asks for a

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.070 
it will function so it asks for a
location<00:03:28.200> I'm<00:03:28.880> recording<00:03:29.880> it<00:03:30.000> on<00:03:30.240> my<00:03:30.600> desktop

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
location I'm recording it on my desktop

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:44.230 
location I'm recording it on my desktop

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:52.420 

original<00:03:48.290> let's<00:03:49.940> correct<00:03:50.940> the

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
original let's correct the

00:03:52.430 --> 00:04:00.850

Turkish<00:03:53.430> I<00:03:55.130> letter

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:14.530 

okay

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:26.490 

yeah<00:04:15.910> it<00:04:16.910> started<00:04:17.449> copying

watching it also real-time so on the

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.190 
watching it also real-time so on the
dashboard<00:04:47.800> let's<00:04:48.340> check<00:04:48.880> if<00:04:49.120> anything<00:04:49.870> goes

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.200

everything<00:04:54.790> seems<00:04:55.090> to<00:04:55.210> be<00:04:55.330> normal<00:04:55.600> so<00:04:56.020> far

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.469 

yeah

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:14.070 

so<00:05:10.479> what<00:05:10.750> I'm<00:05:10.900> using<00:05:10.930> is<00:05:11.500> actually<00:05:12.900> not<00:05:13.900> a<00:05:13.930> very

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
so what I'm using is actually not a very

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.610 
so what I'm using is actually not a very
perfect<00:05:14.849> computer<00:05:15.849> it<00:05:16.210> is<00:05:16.389> a<00:05:16.419> quite<00:05:17.080> old<00:05:17.110> one

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
perfect computer it is a quite old one

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:33.260 
perfect computer it is a quite old one
with<00:05:18.900> 512mb<00:05:21.000> RAM

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.760 

okay<00:05:34.270> it<00:05:34.419> saves<00:05:34.689> me<00:05:34.839> that<00:05:34.990> I<00:05:35.020> should<00:05:35.379> turn<00:05:35.559> off

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770 
okay it saves me that I should turn off

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:59.730 
okay it saves me that I should turn off
to<00:05:35.949> dashboard<00:05:36.129> I<00:05:39.210> turned<00:05:40.210> it<00:05:40.389> off

00:05:59.730 --> 00:05:59.740 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:04.830
