00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:34.060 
which I guess that's the site name I

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.059 
which I guess that's the site name I
haven't<00:06:34.180> really<00:06:34.389> mentioned<00:06:35.319> that<00:06:35.649> yet<00:06:35.860> but

00:06:36.059 --> 00:06:36.069 
haven't really mentioned that yet but

the name of the site is the blog pit it
is<00:06:39.399> going<00:06:39.580> to<00:06:39.639> be<00:06:39.729> a<00:06:39.759> pretty<00:06:40.180> noose<00:06:40.449> I

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:40.900 
is going to be a pretty noose I

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.390 
is going to be a pretty noose I
and<00:06:41.020> it<00:06:41.169> will<00:06:41.320> take<00:06:41.560> some<00:06:41.710> time<00:06:41.770> to<00:06:42.070> grow<00:06:42.220> and

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:42.400 
and it will take some time to grow and

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.330 
and it will take some time to grow and
expand<00:06:42.820> so<00:06:43.720> expect<00:06:44.199> lots<00:06:44.560> of<00:06:44.740> new<00:06:44.889> additions
