00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.000
 hello girls today we are going to make coca de 

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:08.120
 handyman with chocolate I hope that you 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.240
 like what we need will be a leaf 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.849
 of sheet of puff pastry 300 grams of 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.490
 flour salt the one we want chocolate 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:19.310
 margarine and olive oil 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:22.820
 we will start preheating the oven to 200 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.700
 degrees and in fan function I think that 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:29.410
 is 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:31.480
 and we're going to put a baking paper 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.630
 so that the coca is not stuck to the 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.960
 tray and we will take out the mass of 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:40.140
 puff pastry sheet 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.110
 you have to be careful because it sticks 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.010
 once taken out we will study it a little 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.010
 with the roller 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.420
 and we'll press it so it does not go up in the 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:58.340
 oven I do not pinch it very well and it went up 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.340
 one part of himself and another not but good 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:05.000
 later to make the moritas we will put 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:07.330
 300 grams that is a glass and a little 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.330
 flour 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.900
 and salt 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.520
 salt is important because they have to 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.530
 be healthy edited but it's good to go 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.590
 trying and adding the one we want 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.320
 then add a little oil not 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.690
 you pass 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.010
 that you can put the gums does not pass 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.250
 nothing 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.840
 and the little hands are formed by stirring 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.210
 the first time he did it and neither 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.720
 I knew very well how it was done but what 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.640
 The only thing I did was remove by hand 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.060
 like pinching a little and they went out 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.060
 alone 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.100
 here you can add a little oil 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.100
 if they have not left them very children / as 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.220
 and so they would have to be left less 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:57.940
 then the chocolate we will do it as 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:00.520
 always with a chocolate tablet and 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.080
 cutting the pieces to remove in 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.550
 the microwave adds a bit of 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.159
 margarine because I did not have much 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.879
 chocolate 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.319
 but well it gave a taste too 

00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:13.019
 special 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.819
 you have to be very careful so that you do not 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:17.760
 burn the chocolate because if you do not go to 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.439
 see very weird I think that's what I 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.870
 happened to me because it's not finished 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:23.700
 melt completely and then I had to 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.340
 put a little syrup that had 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.890
 there it messes up a mess but 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.860
 good has come out very rich 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.569
 then we are expanding it a bit with 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.500
 the spatula that I already made with 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.750
 spoon and went out 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.580
 and when it is already scattered we throw the 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:45.720
 balls above distributing the 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.720
 uniformly you already know 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.760
 It has a pint burning thousand 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:00.930
 then we put them in the oven in the 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.239
 center not a low mass so you do not 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.790
 burn the nuns and we'll leave her there 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:08.400
 for 15 minutes you always have to be 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.620
 watching so that you do not burn what is 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.280
 that almost happened to me I was very hard 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.160
 fast and I had to take it out 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.440
 and that way my grandmother would be very rich 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.470
 the cia is the first and already heard 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.330
 You see, it's super easy, it's very rich, 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.459
 a contrast between salty and sweet that 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:28.870
 I love it I hope you liked it 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.870
 and until the next video
