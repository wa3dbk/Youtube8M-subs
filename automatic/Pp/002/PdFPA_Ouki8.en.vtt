blocks<00:01:58.179> so<00:01:59.179> yeah<00:01:59.330> Finn<00:01:59.569> hi<00:01:59.690> doll<00:01:59.899> I<00:02:00.110> think<00:02:00.530> yeah

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
blocks so yeah Finn hi doll I think yeah

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.919 
blocks so yeah Finn hi doll I think yeah
you<00:02:00.890> can<00:02:01.130> add<00:02:01.310> textures<00:02:02.179> from<00:02:02.390> when<00:02:02.569> you<00:02:02.690> land

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:02.929 
you can add textures from when you land

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:07.450 
you can add textures from when you land
on<00:02:03.940> to<00:02:04.940> carpets<00:02:05.740> like<00:02:06.740> if<00:02:06.860> you<00:02:06.950> land<00:02:07.130> onto<00:02:07.340> a

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
on to carpets like if you land onto a

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.800 
on to carpets like if you land onto a
cup<00:02:07.700> from<00:02:08.210> like<00:02:08.479> I<00:02:08.780> think<00:02:09.880> around<00:02:10.880> that<00:02:11.120> amount

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
cup from like I think around that amount

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.460 
cup from like I think around that amount
of<00:02:11.900> blocks<00:02:12.550> for<00:02:13.550> or<00:02:13.730> something<00:02:13.990> yeah<00:02:14.990> then<00:02:15.319> it

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
of blocks for or something yeah then it

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.440 
of blocks for or something yeah then it
start<00:02:15.890> showing<00:02:16.160> the<00:02:16.280> particles<00:02:16.730> so<00:02:16.940> if<00:02:17.300> you

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
start showing the particles so if you

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.140 
start showing the particles so if you
land<00:02:17.660> on<00:02:17.750> a<00:02:17.840> carpet<00:02:18.170> from<00:02:18.319> there<00:02:18.970> still<00:02:19.970> get
