00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.730
 not knowing how accurate and followed 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.890
 my instructions do not watch this video 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.530
 lesson until you write the text but 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:14.160
 excellent its instructions clearly followed 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:17.789
 I wrote with the selling text 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:21.420
 if now I place this text in 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.400
 the Internet then people go to the site 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.260
 will start after some time she 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.890
 they will not order anything they will 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.199
 just stop by and after a few seconds 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:33.840
 leave here today 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.930
 such dry lyrics don't attract people 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.649
 they immediately leave the site and quite another 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:44.360
 the case when the pictures are placed in the text 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:47.850
 photographs and drawings illustrating schemes 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.920
 none and the corresponding clearly 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.510
 context 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.090
 content for example now I'm in this 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.629
 text will put pictures of beautiful 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.710
 slim 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:01.260
 tanned girls on exotic background 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.510
 beaches of course it will be beautiful 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.860
 it will be great to look at all straight 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.590
 please the eye but sales will not bring 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.080
 because the picture does not match 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.869
 subject of the text text 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.450
 talks about the LED tape about 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.270
 how to use it how to use here 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.500
 this is exactly what should lyustrirovat 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.880
 photos and pictures in the application folder 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.990
 there is another folder which 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.820
 called pictures for the site in it 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.320
 There are those photos that I 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.840
 posted on your website 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.119
 This is the most ordinary photos 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.939
 which I photographed on camera 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.159
 and a little straightened photoshop is nothing 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.399
 unusual there is not any 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.740
 tricks are not the most ordinary 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.630
 drawings of the most ordinary photos 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.759
 which you do with your 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.369
 the camera is inserted into the site 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.460
 This is done as follows: here I am 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.690
 opened the text put the cursor over here in 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.820
 this place 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:09.510
 clicking on enter and now here i am 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:12.570
 insert a picture for this i click here 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:14.490
 on this button here it is this button on 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:20.220
 toolbar it is so called 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:23.310
 insert image click and go to that 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.260
 the very folder where my are located 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.120
 pictures here it is the application I have her 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.380
 opening up 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:33.930
 pictures for the site and choose this one 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:37.320
 click image insert all 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:40.470
 she stuck in a similar way i 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:44.030
 insert the following picture put the cursor 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:46.100
 at the end of the sentence by pressing enter 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.700
 click here 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:52.710
 I select the next picture insert 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.690
 Practice now and put in 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:58.230
 text for now my pictures 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:00.870
 and then try to take yours 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:04.410
 itâ€™s always a rule to sign 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:07.080
 pictures seem to be why they are 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.150
 sign if everything is so clear that 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.930
 here is drawn and in the text is 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.300
 explanation 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.180
 but nevertheless always drawings 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:18.440
 sign why because first 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.959
 search engines like it 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:25.080
 better refer to such sites and 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:27.209
 secondly people like it more 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.680
 I will tell you the following video tutorials and 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.600
 pro search engine 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.880
 and about people and about what they like and 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.680
 what I like in more detail well 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.320
 Now I will show you how to sign 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:42.410
 drawing is very simple here 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:46.680
 the cursor in this place here it is the cursor 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:51.019
 pressing enter and typing from the keyboard 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.019
 phrase LED strip 5 meters long 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:56.959
 in order to visually separate here 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.700
 this signature from the main text in order 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:02.840
 so as not to mix 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:05.620
 and the visitor realized that this is a signature to 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:11.530
 photos for the picture are part of the text 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:14.750
 the best and highlight this way and 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:18.380
 make it like that 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.700
 It turns out a signature that does not distract 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.460
 does not hit the eyes 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.330
 at the same time gives extra yet 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.480
 explanation 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:29.330
 what exactly are we presenting here on 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.310
 site and now take a camera and 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.110
 take a picture of your favorite thing 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.660
 which you described previous 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:38.660
 video lesson take a picture of her from different 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.850
 sides in different perspectives and paste into 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.910
 text so everything is logical everything 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:45.440
 normally it looked well combined 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.720
 when you insert this page 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.480
 you have a photo of your camera 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.400
 the next photo will happen 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:56.360
 very cool and it will crawl all over 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:58.370
 screen and take up all the space here 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:02.780
 there are corners such for which 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:05.570
 You can pull up here they are pictures 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.880
 reduce that is pull reduce so 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:11.840
 so that you have it 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:16.130
 took the normal size here and so 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:18.500
 all here is the whole nuance is that 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:20.990
 actually on the site do this 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:23.750
 I can not be here now, and you exercise 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:26.180
 you can do it because for now 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.960
 your creation on the internet is not yet 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:31.130
 posting 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:33.860
 but when the site is already planned to post 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:35.930
 on the Internet, these are the pictures here 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.479
 it is necessary to compress photoshop 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:42.200
 well, or in other programs that 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:44.120
 can process raster graphics then 

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.250
 photo which is obtained at the output 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:49.490
 digital camera on a very big 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:53.150
 will hang several megabytes if 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:54.860
 we will insert 5 photos weighing five in 6 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:57.849
 megabyte to your site 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:01.280
 then it will load indefinitely 

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:02.210
 so the photos before them 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.550
 insert 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:07.460
 but the media optimizes them first 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:10.159
 reduces their geometric dimensions and 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:12.439
 reduces the file size itself 

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:15.169
 this process is simple 

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:17.719
 not difficult short in the process 

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:20.150
 learning school selling sites you 

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:22.669
 learn how to do it and get 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:25.159
 programs that are necessary for this 

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:25.780
 and free programs by the way 

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:28.400
 by saying 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:30.740
 Glorious chip school selling sites 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:33.879
 is that we are here 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:35.060
 we use only free programs 

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:37.009
 legal 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:39.979
 laws of the program that is, they can 

00:06:37.009 --> 00:06:42.469
 enjoy free and no

 copyright you while violating not 

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:44.860
