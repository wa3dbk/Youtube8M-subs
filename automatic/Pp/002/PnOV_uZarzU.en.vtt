00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.250
 So my beautiful country with cheese too 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.790
 do you need first two eggs for 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:13.139
 one person slightly smaller pan a 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.880
 bit of oil and a slice of cheese and 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.760
 I 'll do a slice 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.930
 then smoked ham 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.310
 knife and only then can it go so 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.410
 and we also need one more 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:31.220
 little milk one beats both how and 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.220
 they are able to get a bowl 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.560
 you give a little milk 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.199
 and then you can handle it all well 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.060
 break everything 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:55.600
 that should be enough 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:58.149
 if the pan is hot enough you can 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:02.110
 if you recognize it a bit 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:06.429
 water and then a drop in the 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:11.319
 pan gives whether it crackles like 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:13.450
 So now very hot enough to cheese and 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.260
 smoked the cooked ham 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.849
 pour 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.849
 cut the little stripes 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.420
 or a small piece as you want 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.980
 so the cheese in small slices 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.890
 say that much easier than you 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.890
 looks 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:50.170
 then the egg placed in the pan that 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:51.730
 that too is not pleasant when it does 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.350
 outside around 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:04:02.690
 nevertheless not everything perfect 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:04:06.170
 turn around so now we give read 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:08.530
 and the noise or just the one 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.530
 children 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:39.000
 well distribute where you guess then you can 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:40.949
 maybe it will turn around so well 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:48.689
 outer edge is already spatially 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:53.419
 that's why court the last time around there 

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:53.419
 I did not think that two found 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:14.779
 so I've even turned that around now and 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:15.619
 now it's done and then I would 

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:18.249
 say hat off 

00:05:15.619 --> 00:05:18.249
 Enjoy your meal
