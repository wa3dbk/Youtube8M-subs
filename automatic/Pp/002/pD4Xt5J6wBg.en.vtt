00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 a minecraft server does that 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.600
 play together with several friends 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.519
 a minecraft world as it is possible 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.740
 own a minecraft server 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.639
 completely free and in version 1.8 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.710
 sit up 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.809
 You will hear that in this video from 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.190
 tutorial center I wish you much 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.190
 fun and good luck 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.119
 to give us a minecraft server too 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.830
 let's visit minecraft point 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.050
 nice this is the official site of 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.369
 minecraft from hosted and on this 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.800
 we find a small one on the right 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.750
 noticeable button named tor note 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.730
 this leads and second in the download 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.410
 section of the page and below below 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.180
 multiplayer server we find one 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.300
 more link and minecraft 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.950
 underlined server 1.8 point exe and 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.510
 We are loading this file now 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.309
 with a simple click and file 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.930
 Download and save it 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.820
 downloaded then we pull it 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.680
 just drag and drop directly into 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.879
 a newly created folder extra for 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.949
 the server in this case is called the 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.020
 server test and get there handy 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.059
 Now it becomes a grass 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.920
 However, this is not the blog 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.290
 case , just open the right-click 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.909
 with and selects java otherwise becomes 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.590
 the minecraft server does not start at 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.640
 me in this case, but everything works and 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.439
 with a double click we can in 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.760
 In this case, execute the file now 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.890
 the console opens 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.720
 The console is practically the status 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.670
 update the service is always here 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.500
 all information and you recognize how 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.570
 many players are on the server 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.189
 The console closed, however, then 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.439
 also the server does not run now 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.700
 the console generates us a file 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.710
 eilers and practically the 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.390
 terms of business mojang or even 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.909
 of the game and we have to promote that 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.100
 start the server once 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.420
 and before we do that 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.740
 It does not start itself either 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.350
 That's why we have to do it now 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.079
 with a double-click eg with the editor 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.329
 or open with word file and get 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.070
 in it some information as you see 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.750
 and there is also a link in it 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.250
 and this agreement we can do that 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.850
 now, of course, once again 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.290
 read through 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.030
 by simply connecting the link to the 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.219
 copy the browser and then there is one 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.930
 other guidelines that you hold 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.640
 should if you hosted this server 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.469
 the most important but only on the edge 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.090
 Of course we have to mention that now 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.430
 eula confirm that we practically 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.560
 say yes we've read this and this 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.569
 Let's go back to the text document and 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.790
 change euler if completely 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.530
 easy to Euler two 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.300
 We confirm the whole 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.620
 and only need to save to file 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.150
 then click the changes 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.560
 namely taken over and we have 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.240
 practically agreed to dollar 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.400
 in the console we can stop now 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.930
 is input window then because 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.430
 the console stops and closes 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.050
 itself so that the server 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.180
 not running anymore we start, however 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.650
 directly back to further files and 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.780
 folders to generate structures 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.610
 and that happens in this case, too 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.170
 recognize that we are generating a world 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.480
 was and log files are now 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.370
 available and so everything so far 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.750
 we have to work now 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.430
 make some more adjustments 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.800
 so that the server really synonymous for 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.269
 others will be accessible and for that 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.190
 we must now, among others, the 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.810
 server puncto parties edit yet 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.340
 Before that, we invite you to a free one 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.410
 program down this is called lobby 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.600
 in hama the link to this is of course in 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.310
 the video description of this you have to 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.260
 download you and practically one 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.850
 connection via the internet to yours 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.959
 friends playing on the server 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.370
 want to produce 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.870
 For that we click now in this case 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.120
 Save to file and if you the 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.680
 then downloaded the file 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.209
 you just by the 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.769
 Installation wizard so that we are in 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.080
 end effect exactly this program interface 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.390
 in front of you and now here completely 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.549
 just a new network over network 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.230
 Create a new network 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:24.030
 Now you have to sign up for this network 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.440
 of course, think of a name in 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.170
 In this case I just say I am 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.030
 a 1.8 server will repeat the password 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.950
 and enter and then you have in this 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.660
 case new network created and 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.130
 those who want to play with you 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.200
 they now have to connect as well 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.700
 that's what you do with network 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.500
 Join the network 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.090
 So almost exactly the reverse of the 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.920
 made her out there and give her there 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.750
 then, accordingly, euro id a dia 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.000
 that was yes I am one 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.709
 1.8 server and the password and click 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.690
 then join on so that you as well 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.010
 I in this case with sonics pc then im 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.870
 the final result be connected 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.250
 So now we have a connection 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.140
 made yet and after minecraft 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.880
 it does not look all that and that 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.440
 changes now we copy with 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.959
 right click here in the window of 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.609
 Mr. Matschie the ip-address that becomes 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.329
 practically our server address in the 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:07.950
 afterwards 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:09.600
 and now we go back to the folder 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.459
 which we first created and in it 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.440
 find the server point properties 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.390
 we will edit this settings file 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.400
 now with plus that's in this case 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.260
 a very good editor because the whole lot 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.419
 you can see clearly 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.070
 But other editors take such as 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.990
 becomes 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.430
 now we go here in this case to 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.870
 the special settings that we 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.300
 have to work and that's all 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.610
 server server ip is like in this case 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.140
 just mentioned our ip address the 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.180
 Therefore we have copied taxation 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:38.260
 to insert and she will be here directly 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:40.370
 implemented and will be adopted 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.570
 otherwise we do not really have to 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.250
 much more can and set 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.660
 actually only save and that 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.400
 Of course not to forget everything 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.140
 close and then of course that 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.180
 restart minecraft server now 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.470
 this starts for the first time and in 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.690
 We arrived at minecraft now 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.950
 finally click on adserver to see there 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.750
 we now minecraft server can us 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:58.460
 to come up with another name but completely 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.710
 important and the server address must 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:03.140
 Now we have our server ipv4 address 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.090
 register again with ctr v v for you yes 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.770
 still in the clipboard and have 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.050
 now we are easily even 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.090
 and then it means as much as finished and 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.610
 we're practically done too here 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:16.040
 we are shown the minecraft server 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.840
 Now we have ours successfully 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.070
 Minecraft multiplayer server created 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.570
 I hope you liked it 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.190
 and if that is so, and you and this 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.810
 video helped then I am glad 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:25.160
 me about an abo because so will the 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.290
 always up to date 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.730
 for minecraft server creation under 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:29.300
 other things you can also bucket server 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:31.370
 create 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.840
 More on that soon in a new video though 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.530
 you just want to take a look inside 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.530
 the playlist
