that's<00:00:08.189> the<00:00:08.460> on/off<00:00:09.090> switch<00:00:09.120> the<00:00:09.990> power

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
that's the on/off switch the power

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.450 
that's the on/off switch the power
switch<00:00:11.300> it<00:00:12.300> has<00:00:12.570> a<00:00:12.599> lock<00:00:13.049> on<00:00:13.080> it<00:00:13.349> to<00:00:14.160> prevent

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.960 
provided in your kit as we look closer
at<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.259> needle<00:01:25.530> arm<00:01:25.830> you'll<00:01:26.520> see<00:01:26.790> that

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
at the needle arm you'll see that

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.080 
at the needle arm you'll see that
there's<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.330> thread<00:01:27.840> guide<00:01:28.170> on<00:01:28.640> this<00:01:29.640> needle

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
there's a thread guide on this needle

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.999 
there's a thread guide on this needle
arm<00:01:30.329> that<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:31.049> depicted<00:01:31.470> in<00:01:31.860> the

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
arm that is it depicted in the

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.330 
arm that is it depicted in the
line-drawing<00:01:32.659> this<00:01:33.659> is<00:01:33.869> also<00:01:34.140> very<00:01:34.590> important

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
line-drawing this is also very important

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.450 
line-drawing this is also very important
because<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:36.090> guides<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.659> thread<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:38.009> the

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
because it guides the thread to the

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.429 
because it guides the thread to the
tension<00:01:38.790> control<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.659> thread<00:01:39.930> goes<00:01:40.200> through

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
tension control the thread goes through

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.649 
tension control the thread goes through
the<00:01:40.560> tension<00:01:40.829> control<00:01:41.549> there's<00:01:42.240> another

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
the tension control there's another

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.590 
the tension control there's another
guide<00:01:43.369> underneath<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.579> needle<00:01:44.939> arm<00:01:45.149> that

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
guide underneath the needle arm that

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.090 
guide underneath the needle arm that
I'll<00:01:45.720> show<00:01:46.020> you<00:01:46.079> later<00:01:46.670> we'll<00:01:47.670> be<00:01:47.850> using<00:01:48.119> our

after you slide in the batteries you'll

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.710 
after you slide in the batteries you'll
need<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.390> apply<00:02:09.660> some<00:02:09.959> pressure
