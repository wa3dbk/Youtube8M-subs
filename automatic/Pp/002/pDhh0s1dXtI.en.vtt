came<00:01:42.659> with<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.619> wasn't<00:01:44.159> easy<00:01:44.549> but<00:01:45.149> it

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
came with and it wasn't easy but it

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.270 
came with and it wasn't easy but it
definitely<00:01:45.509> was<00:01:46.020> doable<00:01:46.320> as<00:01:46.740> you<00:01:46.979> can<00:01:47.100> see

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
definitely was doable as you can see

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.649 
definitely was doable as you can see
here<00:01:47.490> I'm<00:01:47.579> just<00:01:47.610> patting<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.270> lightest<00:01:48.630> shade

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
here I'm just patting the lightest shade

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.050 
here I'm just patting the lightest shade
all<00:01:49.079> over<00:01:49.320> my<00:01:49.470> lids<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:50.009> on<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.909> inner

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
all over my lids and on the inner

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.760 
all over my lids and on the inner
corners<00:01:51.540> of<00:01:51.570> my<00:01:51.720> eye<00:01:51.840> if<00:01:52.259> I<00:01:52.439> would<00:01:52.619> have<00:01:52.710> had

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
corners of my eye if I would have had

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.850 
corners of my eye if I would have had
one<00:01:53.399> more<00:01:53.610> dollar<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:54.149> spend<00:01:54.450> I<00:01:54.780> can<00:01:55.530> tell<00:01:55.680> you

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
one more dollar to spend I can tell you

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.039 
one more dollar to spend I can tell you
that<00:01:56.040> I<00:01:56.250> definitely<00:01:56.880> would<00:01:57.299> have<00:01:57.329> spent<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:57.930> on

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
that I definitely would have spent it on

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.499 
that I definitely would have spent it on
a<00:01:58.140> blending<00:01:58.979> brush<00:01:59.009> for<00:01:59.549> my<00:01:59.880> eyeshadow

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
a blending brush for my eyeshadow

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.920 
a blending brush for my eyeshadow
because<00:02:00.810> it<00:02:01.560> really<00:02:02.130> was<00:02:02.369> a<00:02:02.399> challenge<00:02:02.969> to<00:02:03.390> use

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
because it really was a challenge to use

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.899 
because it really was a challenge to use
the<00:02:04.170> sponge<00:02:04.380> tip<00:02:04.799> applicator<00:02:04.829> here<00:02:05.759> I'm

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
the sponge tip applicator here I'm

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:06.890 
the sponge tip applicator here I'm
putting<00:02:06.210> in<00:02:06.299> the

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
putting in the

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.560 
putting in the
little<00:02:07.140> shade<00:02:07.830> into<00:02:08.190> my<00:02:08.759> crease<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.270> then<00:02:09.330> I

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
little shade into my crease and then I

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.240 
little shade into my crease and then I
took<00:02:09.630> the<00:02:09.899> darkest<00:02:10.320> shade<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:10.830> put<00:02:11.040> it<00:02:11.130> into

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
took the darkest shade and put it into

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.970 
took the darkest shade and put it into
the<00:02:11.370> outer<00:02:11.640> v<00:02:11.910> area<00:02:12.270> and<00:02:12.600> it<00:02:13.590> just<00:02:13.800> would<00:02:13.950> have

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
the outer v area and it just would have

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.150 
the outer v area and it just would have
gone<00:02:14.220> a<00:02:14.490> lot<00:02:14.790> smoother<00:02:15.450> and<00:02:15.840> it<00:02:16.590> just<00:02:16.950> would

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
gone a lot smoother and it just would

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.830 
gone a lot smoother and it just would
have<00:02:17.190> taken<00:02:17.400> less<00:02:17.700> time<00:02:17.880> I<00:02:18.030> guess<00:02:18.420> if<00:02:18.660> I<00:02:18.810> had

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
have taken less time I guess if I had

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.050 
have taken less time I guess if I had
had<00:02:19.110> a<00:02:19.140> blending<00:02:19.590> brush<00:02:19.620> you<00:02:20.460> can<00:02:20.520> see<00:02:20.820> here

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
had a blending brush you can see here

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.550 
had a blending brush you can see here
that<00:02:21.090> basically<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.960> trick<00:02:22.230> with<00:02:22.410> these

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
that basically the trick with these

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.760 
that basically the trick with these
applicators<00:02:23.250> is<00:02:23.520> just<00:02:23.970> layering<00:02:24.390> and<00:02:24.900> adding

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
applicators is just layering and adding

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.500 
applicators is just layering and adding
and<00:02:26.040> then<00:02:26.190> blending<00:02:26.640> and<00:02:26.760> then<00:02:26.970> adding<00:02:27.300> more

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
and then blending and then adding more

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.020 
and then blending and then adding more
and<00:02:27.840> then<00:02:27.960> blending<00:02:28.410> some<00:02:28.620> more<00:02:28.830> so<00:02:29.640> that's

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
and then blending some more so that's

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.970 
and then blending some more so that's
what<00:02:30.240> I<00:02:30.270> did<00:02:30.360> and<00:02:30.570> it<00:02:31.110> definitely<00:02:31.290> took<00:02:31.710> longer

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
what I did and it definitely took longer

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.620 
what I did and it definitely took longer
than<00:02:32.220> it<00:02:32.340> would<00:02:32.490> have<00:02:32.520> taken<00:02:32.730> with<00:02:33.240> a<00:02:33.270> brush

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
than it would have taken with a brush

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.440 
than it would have taken with a brush
but<00:02:34.140> I<00:02:34.380> still<00:02:34.560> think<00:02:34.830> I<00:02:35.010> achieved<00:02:35.760> a<00:02:35.970> good

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
but I still think I achieved a good

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.690 
but I still think I achieved a good
effect<00:02:36.780> and<00:02:37.110> if<00:02:37.830> you<00:02:38.130> just<00:02:38.280> sit<00:02:38.460> there<00:02:38.490> and

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
effect and if you just sit there and

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.100 
effect and if you just sit there and
work<00:02:38.850> with<00:02:39.000> it<00:02:39.150> I<00:02:39.300> definitely<00:02:39.690> think<00:02:39.990> that

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
work with it I definitely think that

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.740 
work with it I definitely think that
it's<00:02:40.320> doable<00:02:40.560> so<00:02:41.010> next<00:02:41.820> I'm<00:02:42.030> taking<00:02:42.060> this<00:02:42.480> elf

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
it's doable so next I'm taking this elf

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.020 
it's doable so next I'm taking this elf
liquid<00:02:43.350> eyeliner<00:02:43.680> and<00:02:44.040> I<00:02:44.310> had<00:02:44.490> never<00:02:44.700> used

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
liquid eyeliner and I had never used

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.210 
liquid eyeliner and I had never used
this<00:02:45.270> liquid<00:02:45.630> liner<00:02:45.810> before<00:02:46.050> and<00:02:46.500> I<00:02:46.950> have<00:02:47.100> to

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
this liquid liner before and I have to

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.590 
this liquid liner before and I have to
say<00:02:47.370> I<00:02:47.400> was<00:02:47.550> pretty<00:02:47.730> impressed<00:02:47.970> with<00:02:48.360> whenever

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
say I was pretty impressed with whenever

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.690 
say I was pretty impressed with whenever
I'm<00:02:49.050> trying<00:02:49.590> out<00:02:49.770> a<00:02:49.800> new<00:02:49.950> liquid<00:02:50.280> liner<00:02:50.580> I

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
I'm trying out a new liquid liner I

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.300 
I'm trying out a new liquid liner I
always<00:02:51.209> like<00:02:51.600> to<00:02:51.630> start<00:02:52.560> out<00:02:52.680> really<00:02:52.920> slowly

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
always like to start out really slowly

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.550 
always like to start out really slowly
because<00:02:53.730> I<00:02:53.760> don't<00:02:54.209> know<00:02:54.450> how<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:55.170> brush<00:02:55.350> is

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
because I don't know how the brush is

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.220 
because I don't know how the brush is
going<00:02:55.860> to<00:02:56.070> move<00:02:56.190> I<00:02:56.520> don't<00:02:56.820> know<00:02:57.000> how<00:02:57.660> thick<00:02:58.110> of

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
going to move I don't know how thick of

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.570 
going to move I don't know how thick of
a<00:02:58.290> line<00:02:58.470> is<00:02:58.620> going<00:02:58.770> to<00:02:58.890> give<00:02:59.010> me<00:02:59.040> at<00:02:59.250> first<00:02:59.370> and

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
a line is going to give me at first and

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.100 
a line is going to give me at first and
things<00:02:59.790> like<00:02:59.940> that<00:03:00.000> so<00:03:00.150> I<00:03:00.360> went<00:03:00.600> pretty<00:03:00.780> slow

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
things like that so I went pretty slow

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.070 
things like that so I went pretty slow
with<00:03:01.290> it<00:03:01.320> but<00:03:01.590> I<00:03:01.620> really<00:03:02.610> liked<00:03:02.880> how<00:03:03.090> thin<00:03:03.810> the

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
with it but I really liked how thin the

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.290 
with it but I really liked how thin the
brush<00:03:04.320> was<00:03:04.350> and<00:03:04.890> it<00:03:04.950> gave<00:03:05.160> me<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.640> effect<00:03:06.209> that

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
brush was and it gave me the effect that

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.840 
brush was and it gave me the effect that
I<00:03:06.390> wanted<00:03:06.810> so<00:03:07.290> it<00:03:08.010> was<00:03:08.220> actually<00:03:08.550> pretty<00:03:08.580> easy

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
I wanted so it was actually pretty easy

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.449 
I wanted so it was actually pretty easy
to<00:03:09.240> work<00:03:09.360> with<00:03:09.420> this<00:03:10.170> was<00:03:10.530> by<00:03:10.709> far<00:03:10.740> my<00:03:10.980> least

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
to work with this was by far my least

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:12.979 
to work with this was by far my least
favorite<00:03:11.820> product<00:03:12.180> that<00:03:12.330> I<00:03:12.360> used<00:03:12.600> in<00:03:12.840> this

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
favorite product that I used in this

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.500 
favorite product that I used in this
challenge<00:03:13.410> it's<00:03:13.650> the<00:03:13.950> elk<00:03:14.250> mascara<00:03:15.030> for

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
challenge it's the elk mascara for

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.630 
challenge it's the elk mascara for
around<00:03:16.050> three<00:03:16.410> dollars<00:03:16.769> I<00:03:16.980> guess<00:03:17.430> this

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
around three dollars I guess this

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.940 
around three dollars I guess this
mascara<00:03:18.120> was<00:03:18.330> okay<00:03:18.750> but<00:03:18.810> I<00:03:19.230> do<00:03:19.290> wish<00:03:19.650> that<00:03:19.709> I

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
mascara was okay but I do wish that I
