00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:19.369
 worlds in collision the work of emmanuel 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:24.300
 Velikovsky who lived from 1895 to 1979 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:28.890
 velikovsky published his work in 1950 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:32.250
 teacher called worlds in collision 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:36.460
 in his book velikovsky presents the 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.060
 theory of colliding worlds 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.860
 according 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:43.420
 according to this man 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.540
 he claimed that the planet Venus was 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.540
 broken off from jupiter thousands of thousands of 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:52.860
 years before the birth of Christ and 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:55.790
 after wandering wandering through the solar system 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:00.350
 like a giant comet 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:02.570
 it happened around 1500 before Christ what 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.650
 pretty close to the ground for

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.790

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.060
 they maybe the continent of the 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.640
 atlantis and even a violent 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:23.330
 tilt in the axis of the rotation of 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.700
 the earth subsequently to beginnings 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.340
 from the 8th century before Christ 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.670
 venus would pass so close to Mars that 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.970
 should have warned this planet out of its 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.970
 orbit 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:41.160
 and produced with it a series of dangers 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:45.410
 of collision between the earth and Mars that 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:48.940
 they ended in 687 before Jesus Christ 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:52.780
 over time 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:55.870
 and so after the time it was not placed 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:59.610
 in a stable orbit but retains

 very dense that according to velikovsky to 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:13.570
 witnesses in their violent origins and their 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:20.280
 strange story presented in his book
