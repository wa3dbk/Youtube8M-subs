00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
a brush I would not recommend using this

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.309 
a brush I would not recommend using this
brush<00:02:07.229> because<00:02:07.619> um<00:02:08.009> I<00:02:08.929> don't<00:02:09.929> know<00:02:10.079> about<00:02:10.200> you

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
brush because um I don't know about you

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.869 
brush because um I don't know about you
but<00:02:10.619> I<00:02:10.649> don't<00:02:10.739> understand<00:02:11.310> how<00:02:11.370> people<00:02:11.459> would

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
but I don't understand how people would

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.259 
but I don't understand how people would
apply<00:02:12.239> how<00:02:12.510> you<00:02:12.569> would<00:02:12.810> apply<00:02:13.970> face<00:02:14.970> powder

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
apply how you would apply face powder

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:20.300 
apply how you would apply face powder
with<00:02:15.660> a<00:02:15.870> flat<00:02:16.140> brush<00:02:17.600> that's<00:02:18.600> no<00:02:18.780> for<00:02:19.019> me<00:02:19.280> so<00:02:20.280> I

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
with a flat brush that's no for me so I

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.470 
with a flat brush that's no for me so I
have<00:02:20.489> not<00:02:20.700> used<00:02:20.850> this<00:02:20.970> brush<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:21.329> i<00:02:21.359> don't

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:23.579 
think i will be using it so i use big

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:26.449

powder<00:02:23.819> brush<00:02:24.200> now<00:02:25.200> teach<00:02:25.440> you<00:02:25.530> how<00:02:25.709> I<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.340> way

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
powder brush now teach you how I the way

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.849 
powder brush now teach you how I the way
I<00:02:26.489> do<00:02:26.700> it<00:02:26.880> this<00:02:27.660> is<00:02:27.810> just<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.049> way<00:02:28.139> I<00:02:28.170> do<00:02:28.350> it<00:02:28.590> but

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:28.859 
I do it this is just the way I do it but

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:30.680 
I do it this is just the way I do it but
you<00:02:28.950> could<00:02:29.100> do<00:02:29.190> it<00:02:29.220> however<00:02:29.459> you<00:02:29.850> want<00:02:30.030> the

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
you could do it however you want the

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.180 
you could do it however you want the
reason<00:02:30.930> I<00:02:30.989> do<00:02:31.049> this<00:02:31.170> way<00:02:31.530> is<00:02:31.709> because<00:02:31.829> it's<00:02:32.130> a

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
reason I do this way is because it's a

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.400 
reason I do this way is because it's a
mineral<00:02:32.370> powder<00:02:32.730> so<00:02:33.389> it<00:02:33.540> does<00:02:33.780> still<00:02:33.989> fall<00:02:34.230> out

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
mineral powder so it does still fall out

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.340 
mineral powder so it does still fall out
if<00:02:34.560> you<00:02:34.709> swirl<00:02:35.010> it<00:02:35.040> too<00:02:35.310> much<00:02:35.840> so<00:02:36.840> what<00:02:37.019> I<00:02:37.049> do<00:02:37.170> is

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
if you swirl it too much so what I do is

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.009 
if you swirl it too much so what I do is
I<00:02:37.799> get<00:02:38.100> this<00:02:38.220> and<00:02:38.459> I<00:02:38.519> just<00:02:38.700> a<00:02:38.880> bit<00:02:39.090> like<00:02:39.269> this<00:02:39.600> up

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
I get this and I just a bit like this up

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:41.539 
I get this and I just a bit like this up
and<00:02:40.230> down<00:02:40.380> motion<00:02:40.799> until<00:02:41.040> this<00:02:41.250> whole<00:02:41.489> thing

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
and down motion until this whole thing

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:44.520 
and down motion until this whole thing
has<00:02:42.269> powder<00:02:42.569> and<00:02:43.200> I<00:02:43.319> plan<00:02:43.560> in<00:02:43.799> a<00:02:43.859> bit

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
has powder and I plan in a bit

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.130 
has powder and I plan in a bit
to<00:02:44.890> even<00:02:45.100> it<00:02:45.340> out<00:02:45.459> and<00:02:46.120> then<00:02:46.150> to<00:02:46.750> put<00:02:46.930> on<00:02:47.020> the

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
to even it out and then to put on the

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.740 
to even it out and then to put on the
one<00:02:47.500> half<00:02:47.740> of<00:02:47.860> my<00:02:48.040> face<00:02:48.340> and<00:02:49.120> I<00:02:49.209> do<00:02:49.330> it<00:02:49.450> again

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
one half of my face and I do it again

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.559 
one half of my face and I do it again
for<00:02:49.959> the<00:02:50.050> other<00:02:50.230> half<00:02:50.470> of<00:02:50.650> my<00:02:50.800> face<00:02:51.209> and<00:02:52.209> then<00:02:52.540> I

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
for the other half of my face and then I

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:54.870 
for the other half of my face and then I
just<00:02:52.870> kind<00:02:53.080> of<00:02:53.230> lightly<00:02:53.380> like<00:02:53.830> worship<00:02:54.340> 11<00:02:54.760> and

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
just kind of lightly like worship 11 and

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.970 
just kind of lightly like worship 11 and
everything<00:02:55.270> and<00:02:55.600> it<00:02:56.110> gives<00:02:56.290> really<00:02:56.680> flawless

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
everything and it gives really flawless

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.550 
everything and it gives really flawless
coverage<00:02:57.340> and<00:02:57.850> what<00:02:58.750> I<00:02:58.780> really<00:02:59.110> like<00:02:59.260> about<00:02:59.290> it

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
have dropped a translucent powder before

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.820 
have dropped a translucent powder before
not<00:04:09.210> this<00:04:09.360> one<00:04:09.540> but<00:04:09.720> it<00:04:10.260> went<00:04:10.440> all<00:04:10.530> over<00:04:10.560> my

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
not this one but it went all over my

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.820 
not this one but it went all over my
pants<00:04:11.070> and<00:04:11.340> I<00:04:11.430> didn't<00:04:11.880> like<00:04:12.000> it<00:04:12.240> at<00:04:12.360> all<00:04:12.830> so

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
pants and I didn't like it at all so

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.130 
pants and I didn't like it at all so
