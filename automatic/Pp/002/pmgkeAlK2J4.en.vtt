technologies doing a quick review on
this<00:00:22.300> little<00:00:22.930> system<00:00:23.650> called<00:00:24.270> DAB<00:00:25.270> motion

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:25.779 
this little system called DAB motion

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:27.990 
this little system called DAB motion
it's<00:00:26.619> getting<00:00:26.890> dark<00:00:27.099> so<00:00:27.490> we<00:00:27.700> haven't<00:00:27.820> got<00:00:27.970> long

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:28.000 
it's getting dark so we haven't got long

I've just fitted this into a Bentley
this<00:00:31.660> has<00:00:31.779> got<00:00:31.930> a<00:00:31.960> new<00:00:32.140> system<00:00:32.470> for<00:00:32.590> us<00:00:32.710> so<00:00:33.670> I'm

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000 
this has got a new system for us so I'm

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.310 
this has got a new system for us so I'm
going<00:00:34.180> to<00:00:34.210> give<00:00:34.330> you<00:00:34.420> a<00:00:34.480> quick<00:00:34.660> rundown<00:00:34.870> as<00:00:35.199> to

of course got phantom power running

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.390 
of course got phantom power running
through<00:03:06.989> the<00:03:07.079> middle<00:03:07.200> not<00:03:07.950> as<00:03:08.070> easy<00:03:08.250> to

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
through the middle not as easy to

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.720 
through the middle not as easy to
integrate<00:03:09.000> with<00:03:09.360> this<00:03:09.570> you<00:03:10.230> would<00:03:10.320> hope<00:03:10.609> so<00:03:11.609> we

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
and tella but we will change that if

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.160 
and tella but we will change that if
we've<00:03:16.410> got<00:03:16.590> the<00:03:16.680> option<00:03:17.010> to<00:03:17.130> do<00:03:17.280> that<00:03:18.019> I'm<00:03:19.019> just

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
now a full scan just goes through the

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.910 
now a full scan just goes through the
various<00:04:07.890> frequencies<00:04:08.550> as<00:04:08.790> you<00:04:08.940> can<00:04:09.060> see<00:04:09.920> and

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
various frequencies as you can see and

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.680 
various frequencies as you can see and
then<00:04:11.280> as<00:04:11.430> soon<00:04:11.610> as<00:04:11.700> it<00:04:11.790> hits<00:04:11.970> our<00:04:12.180> frequency

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
then as soon as it hits our frequency

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.960 
then as soon as it hits our frequency
area<00:04:12.990> then<00:04:13.230> you'll<00:04:13.410> see<00:04:13.650> that<00:04:14.250> it'll<00:04:14.850> be

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
area then you'll see that it'll be

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.479 
area then you'll see that it'll be
picking<00:04:15.300> up<00:04:15.450> stations<00:04:15.720> for<00:04:16.109> BBC<00:04:16.400> national<00:04:17.400> and

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
picking up stations for BBC national and

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:31.200 
picking up stations for BBC national and
then<00:04:17.609> local<00:04:17.970> which<00:04:18.090> is<00:04:18.209> Bournemouth

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.420 

it's<00:04:32.210> just<00:04:32.420> finishing<00:04:32.870> off<00:04:33.250> does<00:04:34.250> have<00:04:34.400> a

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
it's just finishing off does have a

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.700 
it's just finishing off does have a
habit<00:04:34.640> of<00:04:34.790> saying<00:04:34.880> poor<00:04:35.390> signal<00:04:35.630> I<00:04:35.990> don't<00:04:36.590> know

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
habit of saying poor signal I don't know

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.260 
habit of saying poor signal I don't know
why<00:04:36.920> maybe<00:04:37.250> it's<00:04:37.490> just<00:04:37.640> something<00:04:37.880> written

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
why maybe it's just something written

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.600 
why maybe it's just something written
into<00:04:38.510> the<00:04:38.630> software<00:04:38.990> we've<00:04:39.980> already<00:04:40.190> seen

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
into the software we've already seen

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.820 
into the software we've already seen
that<00:04:41.180> the<00:04:41.300> signal<00:04:41.660> was<00:04:41.750> quite<00:04:41.990> good<00:04:42.170> but<00:04:42.380> now

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
that the signal was quite good but now

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.130 
that the signal was quite good but now
we're<00:04:43.250> in<00:04:43.430> we're<00:04:43.850> on<00:04:43.970> fire<00:04:44.330> which<00:04:44.600> is<00:04:44.630> a<00:04:44.720> local

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.140 
we're in we're on fire which is a local

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.860 
we're in we're on fire which is a local
station<00:04:45.380> to<00:04:45.680> us<00:04:45.970> let's<00:04:46.970> see<00:04:47.150> what<00:04:47.300> the<00:04:47.420> signal

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
station to us let's see what the signal

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:53.320 
station to us let's see what the signal
strength<00:04:48.110> is<00:04:50.620> okay<00:04:51.620> signal<00:04:51.980> is<00:04:52.070> 76%<00:04:52.730> still<00:04:53.180> no

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
strength is okay signal is 76% still no

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.830 
strength is okay signal is 76% still no
reason<00:04:53.480> for<00:04:53.780> it<00:04:53.840> to<00:04:53.930> say<00:04:54.880> poor<00:04:55.880> signal<00:04:56.330> but<00:04:56.720> of

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
reason for it to say poor signal but of

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.750 
reason for it to say poor signal but of
course<00:04:56.990> that<00:04:57.140> is<00:04:57.260> going<00:04:57.470> to<00:04:57.530> fluctuate<00:04:58.040> and

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
course that is going to fluctuate and

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.640 
course that is going to fluctuate and
also<00:04:59.090> atmospheric<00:04:59.330> conditions<00:05:00.230> do<00:05:00.440> make<00:05:00.620> a

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
also atmospheric conditions do make a

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.600 
also atmospheric conditions do make a
big<00:05:00.890> difference<00:05:01.010> as<00:05:01.370> well<00:05:03.400> I'm<00:05:04.400> quite

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
big difference as well I'm quite

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:05.860 
big difference as well I'm quite
impressed<00:05:04.910> with<00:05:04.970> the<00:05:05.090> system<00:05:05.450> I<00:05:05.540> gotta<00:05:05.780> admit

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
impressed with the system I gotta admit

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.680 
impressed with the system I gotta admit
officer<00:05:06.410> you've<00:05:06.560> also<00:05:06.710> got<00:05:06.980> there<00:05:07.450> on<00:05:08.450> the
