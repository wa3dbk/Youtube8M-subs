 full and good then let's give them a tour 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:33.880
 let's start with the matches the 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.880
 matches they changed this 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.280
 what's new 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.129
 when choosing 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.960

 except for friendly match championship 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.670
 I think it comes out the same 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.309

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:13.130

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:55.850
 I do not know why they did not add it 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:57.200

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.010

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.140
 blacks in the players we are going to teach 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.140
 whatever 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.170

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.849
 you pause 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.380
 if they want to see all the alignment that 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:52.130
 it will happen to them like that 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:54.110

 Sorry a few days ago 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.230
 because this already know how it is 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.330

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:27.110
 boots but I am is through the 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.110
