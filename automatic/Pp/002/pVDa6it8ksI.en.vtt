one and playstation 4 and the connectors
are<00:00:14.920> difference<00:00:15.360> question<00:00:16.360> is<00:00:16.480> what<00:00:17.290> are<00:00:17.380> you

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:17.470 
are difference question is what are you

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:23.110 
are difference question is what are you
actually<00:00:17.560> getting<00:00:17.950> for<00:00:18.130> your<00:00:18.189> money

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:23.120 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.250 

the<00:00:24.120> original<00:00:24.480> Kinect<00:00:24.660> seemed<00:00:24.930> like<00:00:25.020> a<00:00:25.050> great

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
the original Kinect seemed like a great

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.500 
the original Kinect seemed like a great
idea<00:00:25.500> but<00:00:25.980> unfortunately<00:00:26.550> it<00:00:26.760> had<00:00:26.970> problems

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
idea but unfortunately it had problems

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.660 
idea but unfortunately it had problems
needed<00:00:28.230> quite<00:00:28.440> a<00:00:28.470> lot<00:00:28.619> of<00:00:28.650> space<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:29.100> play<00:00:29.220> and

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
needed quite a lot of space to play and

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.400 
needed quite a lot of space to play and
the<00:00:30.000> Machine<00:00:30.330> got<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.510> bit<00:00:30.660> confused<00:00:30.779> every<00:00:31.290> now

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
the Machine got a bit confused every now

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.200 
the Machine got a bit confused every now
and<00:00:31.560> again<00:00:31.590> what<00:00:32.400> we<00:00:32.489> can<00:00:32.640> say<00:00:32.880> about<00:00:32.970> this

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
and again what we can say about this

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.570 
and again what we can say about this
kinect<00:00:33.540> is<00:00:33.690> it's<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.290> whole<00:00:34.470> lot<00:00:34.680> better<00:00:34.890> we

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:35.580 
kinect is it's a whole lot better we

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.190 
kinect is it's a whole lot better we
made<00:00:35.760> some<00:00:35.910> great<00:00:36.090> advances<00:00:36.540> with<00:00:36.720> version

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
made some great advances with version

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.380 
made some great advances with version
want<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.470> connect<00:00:37.739> but<00:00:37.950> version<00:00:38.430> 2<00:00:38.640> is<00:00:38.850> really

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
want to connect but version 2 is really

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.700 
want to connect but version 2 is really
where<00:00:39.510> it<00:00:39.600> starts<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:39.930> come<00:00:40.170> together<00:00:40.260> we

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
where it starts to come together we

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.680 
where it starts to come together we
notice<00:00:41.010> things<00:00:41.190> like<00:00:41.400> an<00:00:41.910> increase<00:00:42.239> field<00:00:42.540> of

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
notice things like an increase field of

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.840 
notice things like an increase field of
view<00:00:42.900> which<00:00:43.440> means<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:43.800> you<00:00:44.430> can<00:00:44.580> work<00:00:44.670> out

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
view which means that you can work out

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.490 
view which means that you can work out
in<00:00:45.059> smaller<00:00:45.390> spaces<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:46.080> we'll<00:00:46.199> be<00:00:46.290> able<00:00:46.379> to

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
in smaller spaces and we'll be able to

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.140 
in smaller spaces and we'll be able to
track<00:00:46.800> you<00:00:47.040> you<00:00:47.250> can<00:00:47.520> be<00:00:47.550> lower<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.059> ground

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:48.150 
track you you can be lower to the ground

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.689 
track you you can be lower to the ground
we<00:00:49.050> can<00:00:49.199> even<00:00:49.290> do<00:00:49.470> tricks<00:00:49.800> like<00:00:49.920> read<00:00:50.580> your

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:50.699 
we can even do tricks like read your

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:53.570 
we can even do tricks like read your
heart<00:00:50.940> rate<00:00:51.120> so<00:00:51.480> that<00:00:51.780> ability<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.680> take<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:52.949> RGB

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:53.580 
heart rate so that ability to take a RGB

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.820 
heart rate so that ability to take a RGB
color<00:00:53.970> feed<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.510> an<00:00:54.809> infrared<00:00:55.110> speed<00:00:55.559> and

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:55.830 
color feed and an infrared speed and

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.219 
color feed and an infrared speed and
look<00:00:56.309> at<00:00:56.460> micro<00:00:56.909> fluctuations<00:00:57.629> of<00:00:57.750> blood<00:00:58.080> flow

00:00:58.219 --> 00:00:58.229 
look at micro fluctuations of blood flow

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:59.660 
look at micro fluctuations of blood flow
in<00:00:58.409> your<00:00:58.530> face<00:00:58.710> is<00:00:58.920> something<00:00:59.190> we<00:00:59.309> could<00:00:59.460> never

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
in your face is something we could never

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.820 
in your face is something we could never
do<00:00:59.850> with<00:01:00.030> be<00:01:00.239> one<00:01:00.479> this<00:01:01.110> sensor<00:01:01.470> is<00:01:01.500> ten<00:01:01.799> times

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:01.830 
do with be one this sensor is ten times

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.219 
do with be one this sensor is ten times
more<00:01:02.159> powerful<00:01:02.640> as<00:01:02.909> the<00:01:03.030> last<00:01:03.269> one<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:03.809> just

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
more powerful as the last one and just

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.660 
more powerful as the last one and just
gives<00:01:04.470> up<00:01:04.620> that<00:01:04.830> added<00:01:05.159> insight<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.640> we

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
gives up that added insight that we

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.030 
gives up that added insight that we
never<00:01:05.850> had<00:01:06.030> before<00:01:06.210> Kinect<00:01:07.080> fitness<00:01:07.530> offers

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040

these games and you're probably going to

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.819 
these games and you're probably going to
enjoy<00:03:20.949> them<00:03:21.900> what's<00:03:22.900> less<00:03:23.109> clear<00:03:23.139> is<00:03:23.470> how<00:03:23.680> much

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829 
enjoy them what's less clear is how much

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:26.189 
enjoy them what's less clear is how much
the<00:03:24.010> Kinect<00:03:24.370> is<00:03:24.609> going<00:03:25.000> to<00:03:25.060> improve<00:03:25.359> the

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:26.199 
the Kinect is going to improve the

experience of playing games where you're
using<00:03:28.780> a<00:03:28.930> controller<00:03:29.319> I<00:03:29.739> feel<00:03:30.250> as<00:03:30.340> if<00:03:30.370> the

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
using a controller I feel as if the

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:33.000 
using a controller I feel as if the
jury's<00:03:30.849> still<00:03:31.000> out<00:03:31.150> a<00:03:31.449> little<00:03:31.720> bit<00:03:31.930> on<00:03:32.139> things

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
jury's still out a little bit on things

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.729 
jury's still out a little bit on things
like<00:03:33.280> voice<00:03:33.579> control<00:03:34.180> and<00:03:34.739> augmented

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
gameplay with kinect I completely get it

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.839 
gameplay with kinect I completely get it
with<00:03:38.260> the<00:03:38.349> kinect<00:03:38.590> exclusive<00:03:39.129> games<00:03:39.370> what

makes you feel that being able to talk

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:44.009 
makes you feel that being able to talk
in<00:03:42.879> your<00:03:42.910> game<00:03:43.209> or<00:03:43.389> being<00:03:43.569> able<00:03:43.750> to<00:03:43.840> lean

slightly to the left or to the right is
actually<00:03:46.060> something<00:03:46.269> that<00:03:46.389> people<00:03:46.690> want<00:03:46.840> to

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
actually something that people want to

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.000 
actually something that people want to

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
do well playing rain just playing the

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.780 
do well playing rain just playing the
games<00:03:51.250> and<00:03:51.519> finding<00:03:51.879> controls<00:03:52.389> that<00:03:52.780> you<00:03:53.790> kind

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
games and finding controls that you kind

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.170 
games and finding controls that you kind
of<00:03:54.879> as<00:03:55.120> a<00:03:55.810> designer<00:03:56.620> of<00:03:56.769> games<00:03:57.129> you<00:03:57.340> kind<00:03:58.120> of

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
of as a designer of games you kind of

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.170 
of as a designer of games you kind of
unnaturally<00:03:59.079> map<00:03:59.769> to<00:04:00.129> some<00:04:00.370> something<00:04:01.030> on<00:04:01.150> a

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
unnaturally map to some something on a

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.540 
unnaturally map to some something on a
controller<00:04:01.629> that<00:04:01.780> isn't<00:04:02.409> intuitive

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
controller that isn't intuitive

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.920 
controller that isn't intuitive
so<00:04:04.550> Crimson<00:04:04.940> Dragon<00:04:05.300> is<00:04:05.390> one<00:04:05.510> of<00:04:05.600> those<00:04:05.720> games

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
so Crimson Dragon is one of those games

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.900 
so Crimson Dragon is one of those games
that<00:04:06.080> uses<00:04:06.440> traditional<00:04:06.590> controls<00:04:07.310> as<00:04:07.580> well

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
that uses traditional controls as well

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.390 
that uses traditional controls as well
as<00:04:08.390> voice<00:04:08.630> controls<00:04:09.170> and<00:04:09.500> connect<00:04:09.890> movement

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
as voice controls and connect movement

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.090 
as voice controls and connect movement
in<00:04:10.550> concert<00:04:11.270> so<00:04:11.750> here<00:04:11.900> I<00:04:11.930> am<00:04:12.050> flying<00:04:12.350> my<00:04:12.620> dragon

and if I want to get some help from a

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.500 
and if I want to get some help from a
wingman<00:04:15.050> I<00:04:15.350> put<00:04:16.160> my<00:04:16.280> hands<00:04:16.549> to<00:04:16.640> my<00:04:16.760> head<00:04:17.000> the

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
wingman I put my hands to my head the

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.710 
wingman I put my hands to my head the
microphone<00:04:17.870> comes<00:04:18.290> up<00:04:18.530> i'll<00:04:19.190> give<00:04:19.400> an<00:04:19.519> order

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
microphone comes up i'll give an order

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.710 
microphone comes up i'll give an order
advance<00:04:20.720> forward<00:04:21.160> and<00:04:22.160> so<00:04:22.970> my<00:04:23.120> wingman<00:04:23.450> comes

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
advance forward and so my wingman comes

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.640 
advance forward and so my wingman comes
up<00:04:23.900> and<00:04:24.020> helps<00:04:24.260> me<00:04:24.290> in<00:04:24.470> an<00:04:24.560> aggressive

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
up and helps me in an aggressive

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.770 
up and helps me in an aggressive
movement<00:04:25.400> the<00:04:26.060> other<00:04:26.180> thing<00:04:26.330> I<00:04:26.450> can<00:04:26.600> do<00:04:26.750> is

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
movement the other thing I can do is

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.680 
movement the other thing I can do is
roll<00:04:27.790> if<00:04:28.790> I'm<00:04:28.970> seeing<00:04:29.240> something<00:04:29.450> that<00:04:29.660> I

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
roll if I'm seeing something that I

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:30.580 
roll if I'm seeing something that I
don't<00:04:29.780> want<00:04:29.960> to<00:04:30.020> get<00:04:30.110> out<00:04:30.230> of<00:04:30.320> the<00:04:30.410> way<00:04:30.530> of

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
don't want to get out of the way of

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.230 
don't want to get out of the way of
course<00:04:30.950> you<00:04:31.070> can<00:04:31.190> just<00:04:31.370> play<00:04:31.580> with<00:04:32.120> the

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
course you can just play with the

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.060 
course you can just play with the
controller<00:04:32.630> but<00:04:33.470> it<00:04:33.560> just<00:04:33.710> gives<00:04:33.890> you<00:04:33.950> that

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
controller but it just gives you that

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:40.090 
controller but it just gives you that
extra<00:04:35.020> usefulness<00:04:36.020> with<00:04:36.560> the<00:04:36.650> Kinect<00:04:39.010> one<00:04:40.010> of

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
extra usefulness with the Kinect one of

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.200 
extra usefulness with the Kinect one of
the<00:04:40.160> problems<00:04:40.460> with<00:04:40.490> connects<00:04:40.880> in<00:04:40.940> the<00:04:41.030> last

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
the problems with connects in the last

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.330 
the problems with connects in the last
generation<00:04:41.600> was<00:04:42.290> the<00:04:42.440> rid<00:04:42.680> games<00:04:42.980> that<00:04:43.250> will

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
generation was the rid games that will

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.830 
generation was the rid games that will
match<00:04:43.550> the<00:04:43.580> both<00:04:43.940> the<00:04:43.970> controller<00:04:44.419> and<00:04:44.750> the

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
match the both the controller and the

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.630 
match the both the controller and the
kinect<00:04:45.169> even<00:04:45.740> it<00:04:45.830> we<00:04:45.919> used<00:04:46.070> to<00:04:46.190> connect<00:04:46.490> that

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:46.640 
kinect even it we used to connect that

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.640 
kinect even it we used to connect that
much<00:04:46.850> it<00:04:47.060> felt<00:04:47.300> like<00:04:47.419> a<00:04:47.450> bit<00:04:47.660> of<00:04:47.690> a<00:04:47.810> gimmick<00:04:48.140> do

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
much it felt like a bit of a gimmick do

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:49.870 
much it felt like a bit of a gimmick do
you<00:04:48.770> think<00:04:49.070> that<00:04:49.160> people<00:04:49.280> are<00:04:49.460> actually<00:04:49.580> going

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
you think that people are actually going

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.090 
you think that people are actually going
to<00:04:49.970> use<00:04:50.000> this<00:04:50.419> well<00:04:51.169> I<00:04:51.200> think<00:04:51.470> so<00:04:51.800> absolutely

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100 
to use this well I think so absolutely

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.070 
to use this well I think so absolutely
as<00:04:52.550> I<00:04:52.669> was<00:04:52.790> saying<00:04:53.030> you<00:04:53.570> know<00:04:53.660> it<00:04:53.810> is<00:04:53.930> a<00:04:53.960> little

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
as I was saying you know it is a little

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.120 
as I was saying you know it is a little
bit<00:04:54.200> more<00:04:54.320> natural<00:04:54.740> and<00:04:54.830> we've<00:04:55.010> also

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
bit more natural and we've also

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:56.680 
bit more natural and we've also
incentivized<00:04:55.760> it<00:04:55.880> a<00:04:55.940> little<00:04:56.060> bits<00:04:56.270> and<00:04:56.419> easter

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
incentivized it a little bits and easter

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:57.909 
incentivized it a little bits and easter
eggs<00:04:56.750> we<00:04:56.930> threw<00:04:57.110> in<00:04:57.200> there<00:04:57.320> where<00:04:57.530> you're

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 
eggs we threw in there where you're

00:04:57.919 --> 00:04:59.020 
eggs we threw in there where you're
doing<00:04:58.100> a<00:04:58.160> little<00:04:58.310> bit<00:04:58.430> more<00:04:58.550> additional

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
doing a little bit more additional

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.820 
doing a little bit more additional
damage<00:04:59.419> when<00:04:59.630> you're<00:04:59.750> using<00:04:59.930> your<00:05:00.200> combined

players<00:05:12.830> will<00:05:13.040> be<00:05:13.190> actually<00:05:13.370> more<00:05:14.180> interested
