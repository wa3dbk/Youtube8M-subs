lots of stuff this is going to be it so
let's<00:00:39.510> go<00:00:39.690> ahead<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:39.989> get<00:00:40.110> out<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.620> platter<00:00:43.430> and

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:44.899 
let's go ahead and get out a platter and

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:47.720 
let's go ahead and get out a platter and
push<00:00:45.899> through<00:00:46.110> this<00:00:46.260> wall<00:00:46.500> right<00:00:46.710> here<00:00:46.770> this

think because the walls so wide you can

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.700 
think because the walls so wide you can
get<00:00:52.949> through<00:00:53.129> anywhere<00:00:53.489> right<00:00:53.730> in<00:00:53.850> here<00:00:54.059> and
