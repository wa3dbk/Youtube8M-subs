00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.040

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.690

 represent the five peace of Christ that 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.930
 would have appeared to the Portuguese king in 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:00.070
 the night before the battle predicting it 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:02.739
 the very nice record victory for the 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.659
 Portugal dating from 1966 with the most 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.520
 wide negative gap before a match won 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.229
 in World Cup ie when 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.880
 of the game portugal north korea during 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:11.649
 the world cup in england the 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.020
 Portugal loses 3 0 and that's 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:17.159
 finally caught up to win 5 to 3 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.159
 it's good 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.600
 the first Portuguese to have received the 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.100
 golden ball is weighed bio and it's a 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.240
 little thanks to him you won against 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.500
 north korea since he put a 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:32.390
 quadrupled the emblem of seleÃ§ao 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.710
 represents the cross of the order of christ 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.240
 if there is one thing on which 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.220
 Portuguese have made an effort it's good 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.840
 sure their work the briefs on five 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.280
 to bend over to create it the 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.410
 red is for the revolution the 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.100
 clues broke their courage and the 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.170
 blood shed 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.090
 as for the greens and symbolizes hope and 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.550
 between the two we find a sphere the 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.350
 armillary sphere at the wedding close what 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.090
 huge armillary sphere in 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.500
 astronomy is used to show the 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.330
 movement of stars around the earth 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.400
 this sphere is there to represent the 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.600
 great Portuguese discoveries on the 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.010
 sphere is on the white escutcheon 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.660
 containing the five blue pillars 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.340
 the explanation is the same as that of 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.380
 is rather for seleÃ§ao skins 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.090
 and finally a last symbol included in 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.950
 the red entourage of the blazon containing 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.540
 seven castles are and this city that 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.620
 thoroughly according to erich hess defeated when 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.850
 the occupation of the dead the portugal is 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.650
 the team that ate the most 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.950
 yellow cards in a cup match 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.570
 world 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.690
 no less than nine warnings against 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.910
 the Netherlands in 2006 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.470
 this match is also the one where there is the 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.510
 more yellow cards in a single match 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:34.230
 world cup with a total of 16 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.000
 goals schott count there are more 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.170
 yet the portugal match Netherlands and the 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.180
 world cup match l referee 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.220
 distributed the most red cards in 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.840
 expelling four players this match 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.800
 looked like everything except suddenly yes 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.180
 but in the end the years that is the 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.580
 Portugal has never done better than 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.700
 third at a world cup and that's 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:57.960
 arrived only once in 1966 thanks to 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:59.070

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.780

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:03.210
