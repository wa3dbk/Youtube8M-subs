dan we're here to talk about one of the
most<00:00:14.680> exciting<00:00:15.100> features<00:00:15.430> of<00:00:15.520> Xbox<00:00:15.820> one<00:00:16.030> is

most exciting features of Xbox one is

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:17.640 
most exciting features of Xbox one is
this<00:00:16.299> is<00:00:16.450> the<00:00:16.570> concept<00:00:17.020> of<00:00:17.140> the<00:00:17.230> impulse

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:17.650 
this is the concept of the impulse

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.080 
this is the concept of the impulse
triggers<00:00:17.890> before<00:00:18.400> we<00:00:18.490> get<00:00:18.610> started<00:00:18.730> though

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:19.090 
triggers before we get started though

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.020 
triggers before we get started though
how<00:00:19.660> would<00:00:19.810> you<00:00:19.930> describe<00:00:20.280> well<00:00:21.280> haptics

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:22.030 
how would you describe well haptics

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.840 
how would you describe well haptics
which<00:00:22.510> is<00:00:22.720> the<00:00:22.960> study<00:00:23.440> of<00:00:23.560> how<00:00:24.430> your<00:00:24.610> hands

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:24.850 
which is the study of how your hands

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:26.280 
which is the study of how your hands
actually<00:00:25.240> interact<00:00:25.630> with<00:00:25.840> these<00:00:25.930> digital

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:26.290 
actually interact with these digital

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:28.410 
actually interact with these digital
worlds<00:00:26.740> that<00:00:27.130> feedback<00:00:27.700> it's<00:00:28.180> something

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:28.420 
worlds that feedback it's something

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.120 
worlds that feedback it's something
we're<00:00:28.570> really<00:00:28.600> interested<00:00:28.930> in<00:00:29.200> at<00:00:29.410> ports

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130 
we're really interested in at ports

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.740 
we're really interested in at ports
motorsport<00:00:30.610> we<00:00:31.000> found<00:00:31.180> that<00:00:31.300> we<00:00:31.420> can<00:00:31.570> make

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:31.750 
motorsport we found that we can make

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.750 
motorsport we found that we can make
players<00:00:32.079> better<00:00:32.439> using<00:00:32.860> rumble<00:00:33.219> so<00:00:33.579> we've<00:00:33.730> had

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
players better using rumble so we've had

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.310 
players better using rumble so we've had
Rumble<00:00:34.180> obviously<00:00:34.480> for<00:00:34.660> a<00:00:34.690> long<00:00:34.840> time<00:00:35.079> these

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320 
Rumble obviously for a long time these

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.079 
Rumble obviously for a long time these
new<00:00:35.469> impulse<00:00:35.950> triggers<00:00:36.160> are<00:00:36.460> putting<00:00:36.730> rumble

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:37.089 
new impulse triggers are putting rumble

00:00:37.089 --> 00:00:38.819 
new impulse triggers are putting rumble
in<00:00:37.239> each<00:00:37.449> one<00:00:37.690> of<00:00:37.719> your<00:00:37.870> hands<00:00:38.230> under<00:00:38.800> your

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:38.829 
in each one of your hands under your

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:40.380 
in each one of your hands under your
finger<00:00:39.219> so<00:00:39.339> you're<00:00:39.429> getting<00:00:39.489> impulses<00:00:40.149> in<00:00:40.329> the

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.390 
finger so you're getting impulses in the

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.419 
finger so you're getting impulses in the
actual<00:00:40.749> trigger<00:00:41.019> itself<00:00:41.379> and<00:00:41.739> that<00:00:42.100> gives<00:00:42.249> us

00:00:42.419 --> 00:00:42.429 
actual trigger itself and that gives us

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:44.819 
actual trigger itself and that gives us
a<00:00:42.550> way<00:00:42.609> to<00:00:43.019> give<00:00:44.019> people<00:00:44.050> feedback<00:00:44.409> they've

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829 
a way to give people feedback they've

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:46.680 
a way to give people feedback they've
never<00:00:45.010> had<00:00:45.190> before<00:00:45.249> it's<00:00:45.850> more<00:00:46.149> like<00:00:46.210> audio

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
never had before it's more like audio

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.479 
never had before it's more like audio
and<00:00:46.929> it's<00:00:47.019> very<00:00:47.199> subtle<00:00:47.499> but<00:00:47.920> you<00:00:48.010> also<00:00:48.309> got

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:48.489 
and it's very subtle but you also got

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:50.009 
and it's very subtle but you also got
the<00:00:48.579> Rumble<00:00:48.940> motors<00:00:49.210> in<00:00:49.510> here<00:00:49.690> but<00:00:49.809> this<00:00:49.899> is

00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:50.019 
the Rumble motors in here but this is

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:52.319 
the Rumble motors in here but this is
adding<00:00:50.319> another<00:00:50.559> layer<00:00:50.920> on<00:00:50.980> right<00:00:51.609> absolutely

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:52.329 
adding another layer on right absolutely

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:54.029 
adding another layer on right absolutely
so<00:00:52.420> there's<00:00:52.569> chassis<00:00:53.019> rumble<00:00:53.350> the<00:00:53.379> chassis<00:00:53.949> of

00:00:54.029 --> 00:00:54.039 
so there's chassis rumble the chassis of

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:55.709 
so there's chassis rumble the chassis of
the<00:00:54.069> controller<00:00:54.460> still<00:00:54.730> rumbles<00:00:55.089> and<00:00:55.210> it<00:00:55.569> has

00:00:55.709 --> 00:00:55.719 
the controller still rumbles and it has

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:57.779 
the controller still rumbles and it has
weaker<00:00:56.109> forces<00:00:56.530> buzzing<00:00:56.920> forces<00:00:57.309> rumbling

00:00:57.779 --> 00:00:57.789 
weaker forces buzzing forces rumbling

00:00:57.789 --> 00:00:59.069 
weaker forces buzzing forces rumbling
and<00:00:57.940> wobbling<00:00:58.359> and<00:00:58.539> all<00:00:58.690> those<00:00:58.899> different

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 
and wobbling and all those different

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:00.719 
and wobbling and all those different
things<00:00:59.319> you're<00:00:59.469> used<00:00:59.499> to<00:00:59.800> but<00:01:00.249> now<00:01:00.429> you<00:01:00.489> get

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:00.729 
things you're used to but now you get

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:02.849 
things you're used to but now you get
trigger<00:01:01.120> forces<00:01:01.600> and<00:01:01.809> we<00:01:02.289> can<00:01:02.440> blend<00:01:02.620> those

00:01:02.849 --> 00:01:02.859 
trigger forces and we can blend those

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:04.799 
trigger forces and we can blend those
designers<00:01:03.609> this<00:01:03.789> is<00:01:03.909> what's<00:01:04.089> so<00:01:04.239> great<00:01:04.449> we<00:01:04.690> can

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
designers this is what's so great we can

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:06.210 
designers this is what's so great we can
give<00:01:05.019> a<00:01:05.260> feedback<00:01:05.470> that's<00:01:05.890> it's<00:01:06.130> almost

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
give a feedback that's it's almost

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.920 
give a feedback that's it's almost
three-dimensional<00:01:06.729> where<00:01:07.510> you<00:01:07.570> can<00:01:07.720> really

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
three-dimensional where you can really

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.800 
three-dimensional where you can really
take<00:01:08.320> in<00:01:08.530> the<00:01:08.680> car<00:01:08.950> in<00:01:09.340> your<00:01:09.399> hands<00:01:10.240> now<00:01:10.659> it's

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
take in the car in your hands now it's

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.810 
take in the car in your hands now it's
subtle<00:01:11.020> of<00:01:11.200> course<00:01:11.439> if<00:01:11.649> if<00:01:11.890> you<00:01:12.040> notice<00:01:12.460> rumble

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
subtle of course if if you notice rumble

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.310 
subtle of course if if you notice rumble
when<00:01:12.939> you're<00:01:13.030> playing<00:01:13.270> you've<00:01:13.869> got<00:01:14.049> too<00:01:14.170> much

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
when you're playing you've got too much

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.160 
when you're playing you've got too much
you<00:01:14.770> really<00:01:14.979> want<00:01:15.219> it<00:01:15.310> to<00:01:15.430> just<00:01:15.460> subtly<00:01:16.170> affect

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
you really want it to just subtly affect

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.350 
you really want it to just subtly affect
how<00:01:17.469> you<00:01:17.530> play<00:01:17.890> make<00:01:18.159> you<00:01:18.250> better<00:01:18.430> yeah<00:01:18.850> now

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
how you play make you better yeah now

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.639 
how you play make you better yeah now
you<00:01:19.420> know<00:01:20.049> you're<00:01:20.229> in<00:01:20.259> a<00:01:20.380> unique<00:01:20.409> position

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:20.649 
you know you're in a unique position

because you're able to work with a

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:23.219 
because you're able to work with a
platform<00:01:22.299> team<00:01:22.509> as<00:01:22.659> they<00:01:22.719> were<00:01:22.750> coming<00:01:23.110> up

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
platform team as they were coming up

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:25.109 
platform team as they were coming up
with<00:01:23.259> the<00:01:23.469> idea<00:01:23.799> tell<00:01:24.159> me<00:01:24.280> about<00:01:24.460> the<00:01:24.909> first

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
cool well actually we were on the ground

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.760 
cool well actually we were on the ground

floor with the Xbox team at the very

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.980 
floor with the Xbox team at the very
beginning<00:01:32.890> of<00:01:33.369> Xbox<00:01:33.759> one<00:01:34.000> and<00:01:34.149> they<00:01:34.899> were

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
beginning of Xbox one and they were

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.389 
beginning of Xbox one and they were
looking<00:01:35.140> for<00:01:35.320> what<00:01:35.590> sort<00:01:35.770> of<00:01:35.829> improvements

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399 
looking for what sort of improvements

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:38.340 
looking for what sort of improvements
would<00:01:36.579> be<00:01:36.759> useful<00:01:37.210> in<00:01:37.299> the<00:01:37.359> controller<00:01:37.780> now

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
would be useful in the controller now

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:39.749 
would be useful in the controller now
again<00:01:38.469> our<00:01:38.770> team<00:01:38.799> is<00:01:39.070> very<00:01:39.159> focused<00:01:39.399> on

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
again our team is very focused on

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:41.520 
again our team is very focused on
haptics<00:01:40.210> because<00:01:40.509> we<00:01:40.659> found<00:01:40.869> we<00:01:41.109> can<00:01:41.289> make

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
haptics because we found we can make

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.410 
haptics because we found we can make
players<00:01:41.920> better<00:01:42.250> we<00:01:42.670> can<00:01:42.820> actually<00:01:43.000> get<00:01:43.270> them

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
players better we can actually get them

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.599 
players better we can actually get them
better<00:01:43.659> at<00:01:43.840> our<00:01:43.960> game<00:01:44.200> by<00:01:44.740> subtly<00:01:45.219> training

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:45.609 
better at our game by subtly training

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:47.520 
better at our game by subtly training
the<00:01:45.820> haptics<00:01:46.270> so<00:01:46.780> we<00:01:46.869> thought<00:01:47.049> this<00:01:47.320> would<00:01:47.500> be

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
the haptics so we thought this would be

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.529 
the haptics so we thought this would be
incredible<00:01:47.979> if<00:01:48.039> we<00:01:48.189> can<00:01:48.340> simulate<00:01:48.670> what

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:49.539 
incredible if we can simulate what

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:51.359 
incredible if we can simulate what
happens<00:01:49.929> when<00:01:50.140> you're<00:01:50.259> overdriving<00:01:50.859> the<00:01:51.070> car

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
happens when you're overdriving the car

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:53.010 
happens when you're overdriving the car
with<00:01:51.520> the<00:01:51.579> accelerator<00:01:52.149> you're<00:01:52.420> burning<00:01:52.659> out

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
with the accelerator you're burning out

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.719 
with the accelerator you're burning out
and<00:01:53.500> really<00:01:53.679> teach<00:01:53.979> people<00:01:54.219> that<00:01:54.399> oh<00:01:54.460> you're

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
and really teach people that oh you're

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:56.190 
and really teach people that oh you're
right<00:01:54.909> on<00:01:55.030> the<00:01:55.060> threshold<00:01:55.359> and<00:01:55.719> same<00:01:56.170> with

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
right on the threshold and same with

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.289 
right on the threshold and same with
breaking<00:01:56.679> you<00:01:56.890> can<00:01:57.039> feel<00:01:57.310> the<00:01:57.490> abs<00:01:57.880> or<00:01:58.119> you<00:01:58.179> can

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
breaking you can feel the abs or you can

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:00.779 
breaking you can feel the abs or you can
feel<00:01:58.630> the<00:01:58.659> tires<00:01:59.049> starting<00:01:59.409> to<00:01:59.590> lock<00:02:00.130> up<00:02:00.369> when

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
feel the tires starting to lock up when

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:02.749 
feel the tires starting to lock up when
you're<00:02:00.909> braking<00:02:01.119> giving<00:02:01.960> those<00:02:02.079> forces

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
you're braking giving those forces

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.429 
you're braking giving those forces
complete<00:02:03.759> independence<00:02:04.479> so<00:02:05.079> that<00:02:05.229> you<00:02:05.320> can

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439 
complete independence so that you can

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:06.779 
complete independence so that you can
feel<00:02:05.619> them<00:02:05.740> in<00:02:05.799> a<00:02:05.890> penalty<00:02:06.130> in<00:02:06.219> each<00:02:06.369> hand<00:02:06.609> that

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789 
feel them in a penalty in each hand that

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:08.580 
feel them in a penalty in each hand that
would<00:02:06.880> really<00:02:07.179> help<00:02:07.390> people<00:02:07.689> get<00:02:07.960> better<00:02:08.110> well

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
would really help people get better well

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:09.660 
would really help people get better well
certainly<00:02:08.830> it<00:02:09.100> makes<00:02:09.310> a<00:02:09.399> lot<00:02:09.490> of<00:02:09.550> sense

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
certainly it makes a lot of sense

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.940 
certainly it makes a lot of sense
because<00:02:10.240> for<00:02:10.479> those<00:02:10.539> of<00:02:10.750> us<00:02:10.840> with<00:02:11.050> driven<00:02:11.470> when

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
because for those of us with driven when

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.559 
because for those of us with driven when
you're<00:02:12.070> driving<00:02:12.340> you<00:02:12.940> know<00:02:13.060> most<00:02:13.209> times<00:02:13.480> you

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
you're driving you know most times you

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.330 
you're driving you know most times you
get<00:02:13.659> direct<00:02:13.989> feedback<00:02:14.050> from<00:02:14.709> them<00:02:14.950> from<00:02:15.220> the

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
get direct feedback from them from the

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.860 
get direct feedback from them from the
road<00:02:15.550> is<00:02:15.790> in<00:02:15.970> your<00:02:16.120> car<00:02:16.300> to<00:02:16.450> come<00:02:16.540> about<00:02:16.720> how<00:02:16.810> to

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
road is in your car to come about how to

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:17.160 
road is in your car to come about how to
find

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
find

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.870 
find
tune<00:02:17.319> your<00:02:17.349> cars<00:02:17.680> so<00:02:18.310> this<00:02:18.430> makes<00:02:18.580> a<00:02:18.700> lot<00:02:18.730> of

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
tune your cars so this makes a lot of

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.730 
tune your cars so this makes a lot of
sense<00:02:19.000> doesn't<00:02:19.450> it<00:02:19.599> for<00:02:19.750> driving<00:02:20.050> games<00:02:20.200> it

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
sense doesn't it for driving games it

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:21.960 
sense doesn't it for driving games it
does<00:02:21.040> you<00:02:21.310> know<00:02:21.430> when<00:02:21.550> you're<00:02:21.640> in<00:02:21.670> a<00:02:21.760> car

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
does you know when you're in a car

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.490 
does you know when you're in a car
you're<00:02:22.090> getting<00:02:22.330> feedback<00:02:22.510> from<00:02:22.720> all<00:02:23.140> of<00:02:23.380> your

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
you're getting feedback from all of your

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.229 
you're getting feedback from all of your
senses<00:02:23.650> including<00:02:24.040> feeling<00:02:24.610> the<00:02:24.700> g's<00:02:24.940> in<00:02:25.120> your

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
senses including feeling the g's in your

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:26.640 
senses including feeling the g's in your

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
butt when you're driving to the

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.229 
butt when you're driving to the
controller<00:02:27.040> we<00:02:27.250> found<00:02:27.459> it<00:02:27.580> most<00:02:27.730> players<00:02:28.030> when

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
controller we found it most players when

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:29.400 
controller we found it most players when

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
through audio and we can train them

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:41.970 
through audio and we can train them
through<00:02:40.600> haptics<00:02:41.050> to<00:02:41.410> be<00:02:41.500> a<00:02:41.530> little<00:02:41.680> bit<00:02:41.770> more

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
through haptics to be a little bit more

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.340 
through haptics to be a little bit more
analog<00:02:42.459> that<00:02:42.700> means<00:02:42.850> use<00:02:43.120> more<00:02:43.510> of<00:02:43.690> that<00:02:43.840> throw

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
analog that means use more of that throw

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.770 
analog that means use more of that throw
and<00:02:44.650> we<00:02:45.160> train<00:02:45.400> them<00:02:45.550> by<00:02:45.730> actually<00:02:46.090> not<00:02:46.330> just

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
and we train them by actually not just

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.449 
and we train them by actually not just
changing<00:02:46.930> the<00:02:47.140> game<00:02:47.349> but<00:02:47.830> changing<00:02:48.220> what<00:02:48.340> they

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
changing the game but changing what they

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:49.860 
changing the game but changing what they
feel<00:02:48.670> in<00:02:48.819> their<00:02:48.849> hand<00:02:49.120> thinking<00:02:49.660> I<00:02:49.750> was

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
feel in their hand thinking I was

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.150 
feel in their hand thinking I was
playing<00:02:50.110> a<00:02:50.170> demo<00:02:50.380> earlier<00:02:50.709> and<00:02:50.830> sometimes

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
playing a demo earlier and sometimes

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.250 
playing a demo earlier and sometimes
it's<00:02:51.670> it's<00:02:52.000> very<00:02:52.330> strong<00:02:52.660> and<00:02:52.840> sometimes<00:02:52.959> it's

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
it's it's very strong and sometimes it's

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.690 
it's it's very strong and sometimes it's
very<00:02:53.290> subtle<00:02:53.650> so<00:02:53.830> you<00:02:53.890> guys<00:02:54.040> can<00:02:54.160> dial<00:02:54.430> it<00:02:54.610> up

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
very subtle so you guys can dial it up

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.280 
very subtle so you guys can dial it up
or<00:02:54.880> down<00:02:55.030> accordingly<00:02:55.510> right<00:02:55.750> and<00:02:56.140> it's

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
or down accordingly right and it's

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:57.509 
or down accordingly right and it's
completely<00:02:56.470> physically<00:02:56.980> based<00:02:57.130> you're

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
completely physically based you're

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.490 
completely physically based you're
absolutely<00:02:57.730> right<00:02:58.000> so<00:02:58.209> we<00:02:58.330> dial<00:02:58.630> it<00:02:58.750> up<00:02:58.840> when

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
absolutely right so we dial it up when

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.559 
absolutely right so we dial it up when
you're<00:02:59.620> really<00:02:59.920> in<00:03:00.069> beyond<00:03:00.880> the<00:03:01.030> threshold<00:03:01.239> of

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
you're really in beyond the threshold of

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:03.360 
you're really in beyond the threshold of
the<00:03:01.690> tires<00:03:01.930> and<00:03:02.290> it<00:03:02.560> happens<00:03:02.830> automatically

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
the tires and it happens automatically

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:04.500 
the tires and it happens automatically
that's<00:03:03.670> the<00:03:03.760> nice<00:03:03.910> thing<00:03:03.940> about<00:03:04.120> having<00:03:04.360> a

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
that's the nice thing about having a

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:05.970 
that's the nice thing about having a
great<00:03:04.690> physics<00:03:05.019> engine<00:03:05.319> is<00:03:05.440> that<00:03:05.709> when<00:03:05.890> the

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
great physics engine is that when the

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.860 
great physics engine is that when the
tires<00:03:06.190> are<00:03:06.430> beyond<00:03:06.819> their<00:03:07.000> peak<00:03:07.209> we<00:03:07.780> know

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
tires are beyond their peak we know

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.690 
tires are beyond their peak we know
exactly<00:03:08.290> how<00:03:08.470> far<00:03:08.709> beyond<00:03:08.980> their<00:03:09.100> peak<00:03:09.280> arn<00:03:09.519> we

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
exactly how far beyond their peak arn we

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.400 
exactly how far beyond their peak arn we
can<00:03:09.819> dial<00:03:10.090> up<00:03:10.269> or<00:03:10.480> down<00:03:10.600> the<00:03:10.750> rumble<00:03:11.019> based<00:03:11.230> on

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
can dial up or down the rumble based on

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:12.690 
can dial up or down the rumble based on
that<00:03:11.560> well<00:03:11.980> I've<00:03:12.040> heard<00:03:12.220> enough<00:03:12.310> I<00:03:12.489> want<00:03:12.640> to

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
that well I've heard enough I want to

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:13.710 
that well I've heard enough I want to
get<00:03:12.760> behind<00:03:12.910> the<00:03:13.120> wheel<00:03:13.150> and<00:03:13.390> check<00:03:13.540> it<00:03:13.660> out

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
get behind the wheel and check it out

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.030 
get behind the wheel and check it out
let's<00:03:13.840> do<00:03:13.989> it<00:03:14.110> all<00:03:14.260> right

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.099
