00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
hard to mess up the grandeur can be

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.710

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
a lot of it goes away because your eyes

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.580 
a lot of it goes away because your eyes
get<00:04:50.310> a<00:04:50.370> little<00:04:50.580> teary<00:04:50.760> eyed<00:04:51.140> but<00:04:52.140> I<00:04:52.170> do<00:04:52.260> like<00:04:52.500> to
