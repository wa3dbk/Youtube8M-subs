here<00:00:44.750> on<00:00:44.899> the<00:00:45.050> screen

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
here on the screen

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.799 
here on the screen
that's<00:00:46.280> all<00:00:46.460> bioluminescence<00:00:47.300> like<00:00:47.510> I<00:00:47.600> said

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
that's all bioluminescence like I said

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:49.959 
that's all bioluminescence like I said
just<00:00:48.050> like<00:00:48.170> fireflies<00:00:48.800> there's<00:00:49.670> a<00:00:49.730> flying

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 
just like fireflies there's a flying

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:55.090 
just like fireflies there's a flying
turkey<00:00:50.449> under<00:00:52.359> yeah<00:00:53.359> I'm<00:00:54.320> a<00:00:54.410> geologist<00:00:54.920> by

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
turkey under yeah I'm a geologist by

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.900 
turkey under yeah I'm a geologist by
training<00:00:55.570> but<00:00:56.570> I<00:00:56.600> love<00:00:56.840> that<00:00:57.640> and<00:00:58.640> you<00:00:58.760> see

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
some of the some of the bioluminescence

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.439 
some of the some of the bioluminescence
they<00:01:00.800> used<00:01:00.980> to<00:01:01.160> avoid<00:01:01.430> being<00:01:01.699> eaten<00:01:01.879> some<00:01:02.300> they

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
they used to avoid being eaten some they

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:04.990 
they used to avoid being eaten some they
used<00:01:02.629> to<00:01:02.750> attract<00:01:03.050> prey<00:01:03.500> but<00:01:04.309> all<00:01:04.550> of<00:01:04.729> it<00:01:04.879> from

used to attract prey but all of it from

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.370 
used to attract prey but all of it from
an<00:01:05.149> artistic<00:01:05.420> point<00:01:05.750> of<00:01:05.899> view<00:01:06.020> is<00:01:06.080> just

bouncing their butts together which is
an<00:02:33.090> interesting<00:02:33.300> concept<00:02:34.230> now<00:02:35.130> here's<00:02:35.310> a<00:02:35.370> male

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
an interesting concept now here's a male

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.130 
an interesting concept now here's a male
on<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.790> left<00:02:36.060> and<00:02:36.330> a<00:02:36.360> female<00:02:36.540> on<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.840> right

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
on the left and a female on the right

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.960 
on the left and a female on the right
and<00:02:37.410> now<00:02:37.530> if<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:37.920> male<00:02:38.130> has<00:02:38.370> managed<00:02:38.640> to<00:02:38.700> split

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
and now if the male has managed to split

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.420 
and now if the male has managed to split
his<00:02:39.150> color<00:02:39.450> of<00:02:39.630> coloration<00:02:40.319> so<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:41.040> female

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
his color of coloration so the female

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.949 
his color of coloration so the female
only<00:02:41.670> always<00:02:42.180> sees<00:02:42.360> the<00:02:42.510> kinder<00:02:42.930> gentler

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
only always sees the kinder gentler

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.380 
only always sees the kinder gentler
squid<00:02:43.620> in<00:02:43.769> him<00:02:43.890> and<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.730> male's<00:02:44.970> of<00:02:45.180> the<00:02:45.239> other

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
squid in him and the male's of the other

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.339 
squid in him and the male's of the other
we're<00:02:48.390> going<00:02:48.480> to<00:02:48.569> see<00:02:48.630> it<00:02:48.750> again<00:02:48.810> let's<00:02:49.140> take<00:02:49.319> a

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
we're going to see it again let's take a

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:51.259 
we're going to see it again let's take a
look<00:02:49.560> at<00:02:49.650> it<00:02:49.739> again<00:02:49.800> watch<00:02:50.489> the<00:02:50.760> coloration

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
look at it again watch the coloration

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.400 
look at it again watch the coloration
white<00:02:51.810> on<00:02:51.959> the<00:02:52.080> right<00:02:53.239> brown<00:02:54.239> on<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.540> left<00:02:54.750> he

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
white on the right brown on the left he

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.830 
white on the right brown on the left he
takes<00:02:55.769> a<00:02:55.860> step<00:02:56.069> back<00:02:56.130> so<00:02:56.700> he's<00:02:57.360> keeping<00:02:57.510> off

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
takes a step back so he's keeping off

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.570 
takes a step back so he's keeping off
the<00:02:58.019> other<00:02:58.140> males<00:02:58.440> by<00:02:58.709> splitting<00:02:59.250> his<00:02:59.340> body

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
the other males by splitting his body

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.930 
the other males by splitting his body
and<00:02:59.819> he<00:03:00.030> comes<00:03:00.209> up<00:03:00.330> on<00:03:00.480> the<00:03:00.510> other<00:03:00.630> side<00:03:00.769> bingo

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
and he comes up on the other side bingo

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.039 
and he comes up on the other side bingo
I'm<00:03:02.940> told<00:03:03.180> that's<00:03:03.330> not<00:03:03.480> just<00:03:03.750> a<00:03:03.840> squid

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
I'm told that's not just a squid

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:05.809 
I'm told that's not just a squid
phenomenon<00:03:04.590> with<00:03:04.709> males<00:03:04.890> but<00:03:05.100> I<00:03:05.190> don't<00:03:05.370> know

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819

that's a cuttlefish

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.940 
that's a cuttlefish
I<00:03:08.790> love<00:03:08.970> cuttlefish<00:03:09.500> this<00:03:10.500> is<00:03:10.620> a<00:03:10.680> giant

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
I love cuttlefish this is a giant

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
we're gonna see one backing into crevice

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.150 
we're gonna see one backing into crevice
and<00:03:21.360> and<00:03:21.750> watches<00:03:22.200> watches<00:03:22.500> tentacles<00:03:23.069> he

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
stayed out very easily there if you

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.730 
stayed out very easily there if you

it's<00:04:38.790> he<00:04:38.880> took<00:04:39.210> off<00:04:39.390> the<00:04:39.750> cloud<00:04:40.110> of<00:04:40.260> ink<00:04:40.730> lands

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:41.730 
it's he took off the cloud of ink lands

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:43.040 
it's he took off the cloud of ink lands
and<00:04:41.820> when<00:04:41.910> he<00:04:41.970> lands<00:04:42.330> the<00:04:42.420> octopus<00:04:42.780> says<00:04:42.930> look

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
and when he lands the octopus says look

I've<00:04:43.200> been<00:04:43.350> seeing<00:04:43.650> best<00:04:43.890> thing<00:04:44.100> to<00:04:44.130> do<00:04:44.340> is<00:04:44.460> get

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
I've been seeing best thing to do is get

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.210 
I've been seeing best thing to do is get
as<00:04:44.730> big<00:04:44.880> as<00:04:45.030> I<00:04:45.150> couldn<00:04:45.390> get<00:04:45.710> that<00:04:46.710> big<00:04:46.950> Brown

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
as big as I couldn get that big Brown

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.820 
as big as I couldn get that big Brown
makes<00:04:47.520> his<00:04:47.670> I<00:04:47.760> spot<00:04:48.090> very<00:04:48.270> big<00:04:48.710> so<00:04:49.710> he's

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
makes his I spot very big so he's

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.200 
makes his I spot very big so he's
bluffing<00:04:50.190> let's<00:04:50.370> do<00:04:50.520> it<00:04:50.610> backwards<00:04:50.940> I<00:04:51.030> thought

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
bluffing let's do it backwards I thought

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.640 
bluffing let's do it backwards I thought
he<00:04:51.300> was<00:04:51.420> joking<00:04:51.600> when<00:04:51.870> he<00:04:51.990> first<00:04:52.140> showed<00:04:52.260> it<00:04:52.380> so

he was joking when he first showed it so
I<00:04:52.680> thought<00:04:52.950> was<00:04:53.040> all<00:04:53.160> graphics<00:04:53.400> so<00:04:54.120> here<00:04:54.300> here

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
I thought was all graphics so here here

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.480 
I thought was all graphics so here here
it<00:04:54.630> is<00:04:54.660> in<00:04:54.810> Reverse<00:04:55.110> watch<00:04:55.710> the<00:04:55.980> skin<00:04:56.190> color
