00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:01.890
 we select a type program in this 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.080
 cotton case and the machine is not 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.470
 informing something very important for 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:10.649

 temperature 40 degrees celsius to 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:26.850
 then I give it home at home 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:29.130
 Do not forget some garment that 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.860
 we needed to wash this machine that we 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:37.340
 block the door I have the option to 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:40.069

 open the door and be able to enter 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.870
 some other garment inside the 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:51.530
 machine also owns two programs of 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:55.980
 steam the free and the program refreshes with 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:59.180
 Steam is a program that lasts 25 minutes 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:02.370
 within these 25 minutes are 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:05.790
 approximately 15 minutes where the 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.349
 machine is generating steam and in the 10 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.569
 remaining minutes 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:11.819
 the machine only a spin to 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:14.910
 high speed to eliminate moisture 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.890

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:21.180
 allergy that aims to eliminate 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:24.120
 all germs bacteria mites that 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.010

 as we can see here in the panel these 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:39.220
 two programs are exclusive steam 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:42.239
 In addition to the aforementioned programs 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:45.849
 with steam the machine has programs 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:49.569

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.569
 they work like any washing machine without 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:15.569
 steam 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:23.580
 next we will see the system of 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:27.000
 drying that incorporate this type 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:30.480
 washing machines jon being the product I'm going 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.639
 to the drying button since we can 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.950
 appreciate the different types of drying 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:38.639
 which incorporates the normal dried product 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:42.919

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:45.270

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:51.510
 fencing with low temperature iron 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:53.640
 etc. the machine incorporates different 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.950
 types of drying depending on the need 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:05:03.420
 of the client and the type of garment that 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:06.410
 we are going to close next we will see 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:11.190
 the two programs where we can 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:13.650
 refresh tired and dry shoes here 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:16.560
 we press the refresh button reached is 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:21.450
 a program that ranges from two hours a 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:23.180
 hour and a half to dry the shoe is a 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:28.630

 three hours four hours and two hours 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:33.160
 Footwear 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.740
 in this area that is properly 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:42.150
 checked 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:42.150
 remember it is a pair of footwear 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:48.720
 ah 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.710
 one of our main 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:55.120
 Features in load washers 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:57.430
 front is the smart application this 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.500
 application aims to detect 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:02.230
 the possible problems I can 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:04.360
 present our washing machine how to 

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:07.540
 run this application we turn on the 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:10.000
 product we go to temperature what 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:11.680
 we press for a few seconds and the 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.889
 machine starts generating a code 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:17.280
 binary 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:19.229
 I approached my cell any company 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:22.169
 it does not have to be a 

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:24.569
 smartphone to this area and that code 

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:28.520
 binary is transmitted to the platform 

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:32.639
 of technical service once finalized 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:34.439
 true automatically staff of 

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:36.900
 technical service I will deliver the 

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:39.740
 answer to the problem that may have 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.740
 our washing machine 

00:06:44.009 --> 00:06:51.849
 and some tips that we should remember 

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:54.999
 first the detergent as we can 

00:06:51.849 --> 00:06:58.749
 you see here in this area will personally 

00:06:54.999 --> 00:07:00.490
 I recommend liquid detergent 2 a 

00:06:58.749 --> 00:07:02.979
 once any program of 

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:08.439
 washing leave the door open during 

00:07:02.979 --> 00:07:12.190
 some 3 minutes take the bellows and 

00:07:08.439 --> 00:07:15.310
 remove all the lint they generate 

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:18.040
 and that they stay in this zone one of the 

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:19.810
 pretty important tips that we have to 

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:21.710
 keep in mind is the following one time 

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:24.200
 a month 

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:26.660
 let's go to this area 

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:31.090
 we open the drawer and in this area 

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:31.090
 we find the filter to work or 

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:38.250
 the first thing is to take the oversight bounce the 

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:40.550
 water you want held in the pump 

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:45.240
 until the last drop in a container 

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:49.710
 we close again and then proceed to 

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:52.180
 remove the filter in this way 

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:54.789
 object 

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:58.330
 here they go to stop strange objects like 

00:07:54.789 --> 00:08:01.539
 coins pins fluff and so on 

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:04.010
 etcetera etcetera and then we return it 

00:08:01.539 --> 00:08:07.010
 to your position 

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:07.010
