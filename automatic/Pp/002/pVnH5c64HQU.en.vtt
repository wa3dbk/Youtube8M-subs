00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
has no nitrates in it nothing like that

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.649 
has no nitrates in it nothing like that
there's<00:01:25.020> no<00:01:25.580> like<00:01:26.580> side<00:01:26.850> effects<00:01:27.180> with<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.509> and

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
there's no like side effects with it and

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.929 
there's no like side effects with it and
like<00:01:27.810> this<00:01:28.049> thing<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.259> like<00:01:28.409> about<00:01:28.439> it<00:01:28.799> is<00:01:28.939> it's

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
like this thing I like about it is it's

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.719 
like this thing I like about it is it's
in<00:01:30.180> drop<00:01:30.479> forms<00:01:30.930> like<00:01:31.229> most<00:01:32.070> of<00:01:32.369> them<00:01:32.490> say

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
in drop forms like most of them say

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.030 
in drop forms like most of them say
every<00:01:33.270> like<00:01:33.540> for<00:01:33.810> every<00:01:34.020> 50<00:01:34.350> gallons<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.829> cap

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
every like for every 50 gallons a cap

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.730 
every like for every 50 gallons a cap
for<00:01:35.280> this<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.450> for<00:01:36.720> every<00:01:36.960> 12<00:01:37.229> gallons<00:01:37.590> it's

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
for this is for every 12 gallons it's

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.940 
for this is for every 12 gallons it's
eight<00:01:37.890> drops<00:01:38.420> so<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:40.110> really<00:01:40.530> works<00:01:40.710> well<00:01:40.920> for

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
eight drops so it really works well for

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.480 
eight drops so it really works well for
any<00:01:41.220> tank<00:01:41.520> above<00:01:42.530> anything<00:01:43.530> above<00:01:43.920> like<00:01:44.250> a

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
any tank above anything above like a

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.630 
any tank above anything above like a
five<00:01:45.299> gallon<00:01:45.570> is<00:01:45.990> stuff<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:46.770> really<00:01:47.130> recommend

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
five gallon is stuff I really recommend

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.880 
five gallon is stuff I really recommend
it<00:01:47.759> like<00:01:47.970> I<00:01:48.180> mean<00:01:48.360> my<00:01:49.020> tank<00:01:49.350> you<00:01:49.770> could

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
it like I mean my tank you could

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.310 
it like I mean my tank you could
probably<00:01:50.100> see<00:01:50.399> it<00:01:50.490> better<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:51.060> have<00:01:51.930> in<00:01:52.049> other

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
probably see it better I have in other

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.310 
probably see it better I have in other
videos<00:01:52.909> check<00:01:53.909> that<00:01:54.149> out<00:01:54.360> if<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:54.570> can<00:01:54.780> it's
