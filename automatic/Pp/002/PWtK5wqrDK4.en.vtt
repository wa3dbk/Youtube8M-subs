think now the actual manufacturer of

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.820 
think now the actual manufacturer of
this<00:02:08.039> is<00:02:08.280> quite<00:02:08.550> it's<00:02:08.850> quite<00:02:09.090> attractive<00:02:09.830> so

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
this is quite it's quite attractive so

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.650 
this is quite it's quite attractive so
here<00:02:11.039> it<00:02:11.100> is<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.400> Virtual<00:02:11.760> Boy<00:02:12.000> is<00:02:12.330> on<00:02:12.510> its

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
here it is the Virtual Boy is on its

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.800 
here it is the Virtual Boy is on its
stand<00:02:12.989> I<00:02:13.880> know<00:02:14.880> a<00:02:14.970> lot<00:02:15.120> of<00:02:15.150> people<00:02:15.540> have<00:02:15.630> said

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
stand I know a lot of people have said

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.620 
stand I know a lot of people have said
the<00:02:15.930> stand<00:02:16.230> is<00:02:16.350> really<00:02:16.590> flimsy<00:02:16.830> but<00:02:17.390> again<00:02:18.390> I

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
the stand is really flimsy but again I

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.930 
the stand is really flimsy but again I
think<00:02:18.660> it's<00:02:19.260> made<00:02:19.530> well<00:02:19.860> it's<00:02:20.340> not<00:02:20.519> probably

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.729 
think it's made well it's not probably
made<00:02:21.120> to<00:02:21.269> last<00:02:21.480> but<00:02:21.900> I<00:02:21.930> think<00:02:22.140> it<00:02:22.200> feels<00:02:22.700> nice

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
made to last but I think it feels nice

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.680 
made to last but I think it feels nice
it<00:02:25.739> sort<00:02:25.980> of<00:02:26.040> shows<00:02:26.549> up<00:02:26.790> nicely<00:02:27.000> and<00:02:27.360> it's<00:02:27.510> the

it sort of shows up nicely and it's the

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.300 
it sort of shows up nicely and it's the
action<00:02:27.989> is<00:02:28.080> quite<00:02:28.319> smooth<00:02:28.620> so<00:02:29.630> put<00:02:30.630> it<00:02:30.750> up<00:02:30.959> put

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
action is quite smooth so put it up put

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.070
