intelligent design is the idea that we

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
can infer from evidence in nature that

can infer from evidence in nature that
some<00:05:06.060> features<00:05:06.270> of<00:05:06.450> the<00:05:06.660> world<00:05:06.900> are<00:05:07.170> better

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
some features of the world are better

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.640 
some features of the world are better
explained<00:05:08.090> by<00:05:09.090> an<00:05:09.240> intelligent<00:05:09.810> cause<00:05:10.020> than

Collins himself is using of the gaps

it's<00:05:45.270> a<00:05:45.390> Darwin<00:05:45.810> at<00:05:45.930> the<00:05:46.050> gaps<00:05:46.290> argument<00:05:46.860> and

it's a Darwin at the gaps argument and

more we realized that it is in fact

more we realized that it is in fact
