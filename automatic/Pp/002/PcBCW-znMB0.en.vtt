00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.910
 kickboxing world that is due its 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:19.289
 visit today in cancer 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:21.570
 well we have managed to specify 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.000
 and hold a kickboxing seminar 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.320
 muay thai and arts training 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.160
 mixed martial 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:32.520
 thanks to the 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.310
 to the work of Dr. Osvaldo PeÃ±a we have 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.809
 managed to realize this now this is the 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:40.620
 today that is going to happen here in this 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:43.050
 roll and today we are going to delve more into 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.449
 the work of muay thai 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.640
 but muay thai directed more to the fight 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:49.890
 of mma mixed martial arts and then 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.980
 We go directly to training 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.949
 mma tomorrow we will do 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:59.519
 trouble but working more the part of 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.829
 his hits but how do you see the background 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:04.440
 type of sport that you practice in the 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.060
 country lack support is growing which is 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.310
 your point of view in relationships that 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.039
 we have already good in relation to the 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:15.030
 evolution of the muay thai kickboxing and 

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:17.160
 of the mma within Paraguay is at the level 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.170
 current has an extremely development 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:24.070
 big so much so that 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.869
 Thanks to this law , sport has 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.479
 touched a sum of money to the 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.520
 federation where that is invested 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.320
 in the fighters in the preparation 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.060
 physical and on trips to get to 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.479
 get titles abroad bernard 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:41.690
 and technical level we 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:44.090
 Paraguayans we have nothing to envy 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.400
 to fighters in other countries because 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.010
 we have Paraguayan blood that is the 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.710
 first the first great value is 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.960
 extremely seasoned we have excellent 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:57.020
 technical trainers in whatever 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.050
 boxing in muay thai kickboxing in 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.720
 Brazil in its place 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:05.020
 and of course the technical preparation 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.120
 we have physical technical programmers 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:12.160
 first level 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:13.750
 we have alejandro lloret towers 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.370
 and other names and maybe I'm 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.440
 bordering that are extremely 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.990
 professionals and they know what they do with 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.870
 relationship to physical preparation so 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:25.630
 you mention again that in relation to 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.200
 the evolution of sport as such does not 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.140
 we have nothing to envy and now 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:34.590
 in relation to the shows to the 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:37.910
 martial arts events I think that 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.610
 we are also pointing to 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.920
 something nice pretty big thing because 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.520
 every time the organizers of the 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:49.550
 events are improving at the level of 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.590
 young and at the level of fighters are 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:55.520
 bringing first-class fighters from first 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:58.380
 level to compete then the public what 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.170
 what he does is see good fights 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.780
 can you tell the action or your experience 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.460
 he was winning an international title 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:10.830
 travel is a little bit about your 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:13.890
 experiences already good this one really 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.600
 this double national title fight 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.600
 of cause had to have done the 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:21.840
 September 22 but for reasons 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:24.600
 individuals were suspended then already 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.160
 I was preparing for that event but 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:33.430
 there were a couple more fights 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:35.440
 then this title already had this 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.200
 ambitioned long ago since in 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.000
 In 2008 I went to fight in Italy for the 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.590
 Next kickboxing world title 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.130
 l by another federation that is twice as 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:48.610
 kn has nothing to do with this I lost 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:51.310
 I lost it in the third round because I 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.470
 I broke the right instep of the right foot 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.180
 better additional in the third round 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.750
 then I'm a bit unsatisfied 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:01.990
 of my work and then we started from 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.510
 new to go competing and looking for a 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:07.360
 little the possibility of acquiring in a 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.040
 world title or for me because the 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.630
 personal glory is a little more humid 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.360
 but at the level 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.770
 paraguay since I think we're 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.470
 making history with the federation 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:20.080
 kickboxing brave under the teacher 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.950
 biologist since we brought for the first time 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.010
 to Paraguay 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.660
 the world title of xbox if we had 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.389
 formerly great fighters who 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.680
 they also did that 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:34.160
 but it did not materialize now we concretize 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:36.100
 in this sport kickboxing with in 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.810
 relationship to other sports that is what 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.610
 let's say it would convince him or convince him to 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.390
 you to dedicate yourself to this kind of 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.840
 sports 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:48.180
 there are many many many edges 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:51.120
 which one could hold on to for 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:53.250
 practice this combat sport or art 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.680
 or rather martial martial art or 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:58.650
 combat sport 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.990
 let's start talking in children 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:03.870
 this has the martial philosophy is 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:06.420
 important in the formation of the 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:12.600
 child of the girl 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:14.640
 more within its stage from 2 to 18 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.940
 since it is important to give it a path 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:21.840
 straight of martial art evidence for 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:24.390
 that is clear that I am more than sure 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:27.870
 how do you know this discipline as well 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:31.320
 you said respect humility this 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:37.150
 tranquility gives another way of looking at 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:40.350
 life and at the level of sport health 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:43.270
 there is no better therapy after a day 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:45.700
 stressed of coming to work to paste 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.470
 bag and let go as work of 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:50.790
 catharsis I recommend everything that is what 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:50.790
 better that way
