00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
I'll give a shot too just because

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.819 
I'll give a shot too just because
they've<00:01:00.059> done<00:01:00.210> so<00:01:00.359> well<00:01:00.480> in<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.600> past<00:01:00.829> one

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
they've done so well in the past one

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.889 
they've done so well in the past one
thing<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.309> is<00:01:02.340> like<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.760> trademark<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.570> theirs

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
thing that is like a trademark of theirs

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.830 
thing that is like a trademark of theirs
specifically<00:01:04.850> is<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:06.030> their<00:01:06.210> games<00:01:06.420> tend<00:01:06.750> to

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
specifically is that their games tend to

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.750 
specifically is that their games tend to
be<00:01:06.930> really<00:01:07.140> hard<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.590> figure<00:01:07.619> out<00:01:07.979> really<00:01:08.430> deep

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
be really hard to figure out really deep

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.880 
be really hard to figure out really deep
really<00:01:09.240> like<00:01:09.540> tons<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.290> millions<00:01:10.740> of

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
really like tons and millions of

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.090 
really like tons and millions of
zillions<00:01:11.250> of<00:01:11.400> options<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:13.100> interfaces

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
zillions of options and the interfaces

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.590 
zillions of options and the interfaces
are<00:01:14.250> almost<00:01:14.460> universally<00:01:14.610> bad<00:01:15.270> and

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
are almost universally bad and

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.660 
are almost universally bad and
frustrating<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.200> figure<00:01:16.860> out<00:01:16.979> how<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.130> use<00:01:17.430> and

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
frustrating to figure out how to use and

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.940 
frustrating to figure out how to use and
the<00:01:18.299> pace<00:01:18.509> is<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:19.020> pace<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.530> game<00:01:19.710> is

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
the pace is the pace of the game is

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.920 
the pace is the pace of the game is
almost<00:01:20.220> universally<00:01:20.670> like<00:01:21.299> really<00:01:21.720> slow

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
almost universally like really slow

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.980 
almost universally like really slow
paced<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:23.430> lot<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.180> like<00:01:24.360> pause<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:24.869> resume

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
paced a lot of like pause and resume

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.980

and<00:01:28.320> thinking<00:01:29.310> about<00:01:29.670> stuff<00:01:29.970> kind<00:01:30.509> of<00:01:30.600> play<00:01:30.750> so

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
and thinking about stuff kind of play so

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.190 
and thinking about stuff kind of play so
it's<00:01:31.320> like<00:01:31.380> absolutely<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.340> opposite<00:01:32.820> of

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
it's like absolutely the opposite of

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.100 
it's like absolutely the opposite of
SimCity<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:34.470> people<00:01:34.890> have<00:01:35.280> have<00:01:35.810> made<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.840> big

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
SimCity so people have have made a big

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.780 
SimCity so people have have made a big
stink<00:01:37.439> because<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.250> two<00:01:38.400> games<00:01:38.610> were

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
stink because the two games were

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.249 
stink because the two games were
released<00:01:38.909> somewhat<00:01:39.600> close<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.869> each<00:01:40.110> other

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
released somewhat close to each other

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.340 
released somewhat close to each other
about<00:01:40.530> how<00:01:40.799> SimCity<00:01:41.640> is<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:41.970> worse<00:01:42.720> version<00:01:42.869> of

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
about how SimCity is a worse version of

about how SimCity is a worse version of
cities<00:01:43.649> in<00:01:43.740> motion<00:01:44.009> 2<00:01:44.189> or<00:01:44.520> like<00:01:44.909> house<00:01:45.149> if<00:01:45.600> you

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
cities in motion 2 or like house if you

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.359 
cities in motion 2 or like house if you
if<00:01:45.990> you<00:01:46.140> wanted<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.560> city<00:01:46.770> simulator<00:01:47.250> and

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
if you wanted a city simulator and

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.620 
if you wanted a city simulator and
you're<00:01:47.490> disappointed<00:01:47.970> with<00:01:48.090> how<00:01:48.180> some<00:01:48.390> city

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
you're disappointed with how some city

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.910 
you're disappointed with how some city
worked<00:01:48.840> out<00:01:48.960> you<00:01:49.079> should<00:01:49.229> give<00:01:49.380> cities<00:01:49.710> of

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
worked out you should give cities of

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.039 
worked out you should give cities of
motion<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.340> shot<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:51.149> I<00:01:51.360> mean<00:01:51.509> I'd<00:01:51.659> agree

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
motion to a shot and I mean I'd agree

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.170 
motion to a shot and I mean I'd agree
that<00:01:52.259> you<00:01:52.320> should<00:01:52.470> give<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:52.740> shot<00:01:52.979> but<00:01:53.909> I

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
that you should give it a shot but I

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.060 
that you should give it a shot but I
would<00:01:54.750> caution<00:01:54.960> you<00:01:55.229> that<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.619> target

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
would caution you that the target

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.090 
would caution you that the target
audience<00:01:56.490> for<00:01:56.790> SimCity<00:01:57.780> is<00:01:58.100> completely

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
audience for SimCity is completely

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.950 
audience for SimCity is completely
different<00:01:59.549> than<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.210> target<00:02:00.509> audience<00:02:00.840> for

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
different than the target audience for

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.170 
different than the target audience for
cities<00:02:01.320> in<00:02:01.439> motion<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:01.860> cities<00:02:02.610> in<00:02:02.729> motion<00:02:03.030> to

cities in motion to cities in motion to

cities in motion to cities in motion to
is<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:04.219> simulation<00:02:05.219> while<00:02:06.180> SimCity<00:02:06.750> is<00:02:07.020> like<00:02:07.500> an

is a simulation while SimCity is like an

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.880 
is a simulation while SimCity is like an
arcade<00:02:08.009> game<00:02:08.569> so<00:02:09.569> if<00:02:09.690> you<00:02:09.780> could<00:02:09.959> compare<00:02:10.170> for

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
arcade game so if you could compare for

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.890 
arcade game so if you could compare for

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
flying game was that I loved it so much

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.190 
are no other objectives in the whole
game<00:02:44.400> that's<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.329> difference<00:02:45.480> between<00:02:45.690> Sim

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
game that's the difference between Sim

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.410 
game that's the difference between Sim
City<00:02:46.409> and<00:02:46.680> cities<00:02:46.920> in<00:02:46.950> motion<00:02:47.310> to<00:02:47.459> both<00:02:48.090> games

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
City and cities in motion to both games

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.720 
City and cities in motion to both games
are<00:02:48.659> valid<00:02:49.049> lots<00:02:49.440> of<00:02:49.620> people<00:02:49.799> like<00:02:50.129> both<00:02:50.430> games

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
are valid lots of people like both games

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.670 
are valid lots of people like both games
but<00:02:51.209> the<00:02:51.359> same<00:02:51.629> people<00:02:52.079> tend<00:02:52.349> not<00:02:52.409> to<00:02:52.650> like

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
but the same people tend not to like

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.770 
but the same people tend not to like
both<00:02:53.129> games<00:02:53.430> you're<00:02:53.849> either<00:02:54.120> somebody<00:02:54.629> who

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
both games you're either somebody who

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.960 
both games you're either somebody who
wants<00:02:55.019> to<00:02:55.079> play<00:02:55.260> a<00:02:55.349> fun<00:02:55.889> arcade<00:02:56.159> game<00:02:56.639> or

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
wants to play a fun arcade game or

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.020 
wants to play a fun arcade game or
you're<00:02:57.540> somebody<00:02:57.900> who<00:02:58.109> wants<00:02:58.439> to<00:02:58.500> spend<00:02:59.030> 300

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
you're somebody who wants to spend 300

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.199 
you're somebody who wants to spend 300
hours<00:03:00.269> learning<00:03:00.450> how<00:03:00.780> to<00:03:00.840> fly<00:03:00.930> an<00:03:01.439> actual<00:03:02.209> f-14

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
hours learning how to fly an actual f-14

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.280 
hours learning how to fly an actual f-14
or<00:03:03.480> whatever<00:03:05.329> they're<00:03:06.329> very<00:03:06.510> different<00:03:06.810> very

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
or whatever they're very different very

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.920 
or whatever they're very different very
different<00:03:07.409> things<00:03:09.650> so<00:03:10.650> in<00:03:11.010> cities<00:03:11.609> of<00:03:11.930> cities

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
different things so in cities of cities

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.500 
different things so in cities of cities
in<00:03:13.049> motion<00:03:13.379> you<00:03:13.889> can<00:03:14.189> it<00:03:14.670> the<00:03:15.000> same<00:03:15.180> as<00:03:15.209> with

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
in motion you can it the same as with

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.300 
in motion you can it the same as with
some<00:03:15.689> city<00:03:15.900> you<00:03:16.049> can<00:03:16.290> just<00:03:16.620> try<00:03:16.919> to<00:03:16.980> make<00:03:17.250> a

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
some city you can just try to make a

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.490 
some city you can just try to make a
city<00:03:17.669> bigger<00:03:18.209> and<00:03:18.419> bigger<00:03:18.569> and<00:03:18.810> get<00:03:19.019> a<00:03:19.049> higher

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
city bigger and bigger and get a higher

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.589 
city bigger and bigger and get a higher
and<00:03:19.709> higher<00:03:19.739> population<00:03:20.459> just<00:03:21.030> by<00:03:21.150> laying<00:03:21.329> new

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
and higher population just by laying new

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.270 
and higher population just by laying new
road<00:03:21.870> and<00:03:22.109> the<00:03:22.169> city<00:03:22.349> will<00:03:22.500> dynamically<00:03:23.010> grow

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
road and the city will dynamically grow

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.039 
road and the city will dynamically grow
into<00:03:23.549> those<00:03:23.699> roads<00:03:23.970> and<00:03:24.150> then<00:03:24.329> adding<00:03:24.780> public

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
into those roads and then adding public

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:26.330 
into those roads and then adding public
transportation<00:03:25.620> to<00:03:25.769> alleviate<00:03:26.190> traffic

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
transportation to alleviate traffic

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.099 
transportation to alleviate traffic
where<00:03:26.730> we<00:03:26.849> find<00:03:27.030> traffic<00:03:27.480> you<00:03:27.599> can<00:03:27.810> play<00:03:28.079> it

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
where we find traffic you can play it

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:31.099 
where we find traffic you can play it
that<00:03:28.319> way<00:03:28.379> and<00:03:28.680> I<00:03:29.250> would<00:03:29.459> say<00:03:29.699> in<00:03:30.269> that<00:03:30.329> respect

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
that way and I would say in that respect

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:33.619 
that way and I would say in that respect
it<00:03:31.409> is<00:03:31.919> a<00:03:31.949> better<00:03:32.220> City<00:03:32.609> simulator<00:03:33.090> by<00:03:33.329> far

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:33.629 
it is a better City simulator by far

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:35.809 
it is a better City simulator by far
than<00:03:33.810> SimCity<00:03:34.290> but<00:03:34.859> that's<00:03:35.010> because<00:03:35.190> SimCity

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
than SimCity but that's because SimCity

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:37.939 
than SimCity but that's because SimCity
dumbed<00:03:36.419> itself<00:03:36.810> down<00:03:37.019> intentionally<00:03:37.769> to<00:03:37.919> make

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:37.949 
dumbed itself down intentionally to make

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:40.189 
dumbed itself down intentionally to make
the<00:03:38.220> game<00:03:38.400> more<00:03:38.430> fun<00:03:38.790> and<00:03:39.299> more<00:03:39.329> accessible<00:03:40.019> to

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:40.199 
the game more fun and more accessible to

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:42.680 
the game more fun and more accessible to
more<00:03:40.739> people<00:03:40.799> whereas<00:03:41.790> season<00:03:42.209> motion<00:03:42.569> is

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
more people whereas season motion is

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.899 
more people whereas season motion is
like<00:03:42.870> hardcore<00:03:43.229> it's<00:03:43.680> complicated<00:03:44.549> to<00:03:44.669> figure

00:03:44.899 --> 00:03:44.909 
like hardcore it's complicated to figure

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:47.149 
like hardcore it's complicated to figure
out<00:03:45.120> and<00:03:45.359> then<00:03:46.019> even<00:03:46.409> once<00:03:46.829> you<00:03:47.010> know

00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:47.159 
out and then even once you know

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:49.099 
out and then even once you know
everything<00:03:47.609> about<00:03:47.729> it<00:03:48.000> it's<00:03:48.150> still<00:03:48.419> very

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
everything about it it's still very

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:52.849 
everything about it it's still very
time-consuming<00:03:49.530> and<00:03:50.129> tedious<00:03:50.190> to<00:03:50.609> play<00:03:51.859> it's

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
time-consuming and tedious to play it's

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:55.520 
time-consuming and tedious to play it's
not<00:03:53.220> trying<00:03:54.150> to<00:03:54.419> make<00:03:54.599> things<00:03:54.629> super<00:03:55.169> quick

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
not trying to make things super quick

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.589 
not trying to make things super quick
and<00:03:55.709> easy<00:03:55.829> to<00:03:55.919> do<00:03:56.159> it's<00:03:56.370> trying<00:03:57.299> to<00:03:57.419> make

00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 
and easy to do it's trying to make

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:00.530 
and easy to do it's trying to make
things<00:03:57.629> super<00:03:58.169> it<00:03:58.680> in<00:03:59.129> depth<00:03:59.639> and<00:03:59.909> realistic

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
things super it in depth and realistic

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.490 
things super it in depth and realistic
and<00:04:00.750> accurate<00:04:01.229> and<00:04:01.470> you<00:04:02.370> know<00:04:02.780> like<00:04:03.780> like<00:04:03.959> that

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
and accurate and you know like like that

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.439 
and accurate and you know like like that
all<00:04:04.739> the<00:04:05.280> things<00:04:05.519> that<00:04:05.760> simulator<00:04:06.180> games

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:06.449 
all the things that simulator games

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:11.149 
all the things that simulator games
pride<00:04:07.139> themselves<00:04:07.319> on<00:04:09.319> so<00:04:10.319> one<00:04:10.859> thing<00:04:11.099> that

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:11.159 
pride themselves on so one thing that

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:12.770 
pride themselves on so one thing that
you're<00:04:11.459> going<00:04:11.489> to<00:04:11.609> run<00:04:11.760> into<00:04:11.819> a<00:04:12.090> lot<00:04:12.389> with

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
you're going to run into a lot with

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.500 
you're going to run into a lot with
cities<00:04:13.199> in<00:04:13.319> motion<00:04:13.650> is<00:04:14.000> that<00:04:15.000> I<00:04:15.030> mean<00:04:15.299> people

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
cities in motion is that I mean people

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.020 
cities in motion is that I mean people
have<00:04:15.810> raved<00:04:16.289> over<00:04:16.560> how<00:04:16.829> large<00:04:17.340> the<00:04:17.609> maps<00:04:17.849> are

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
have raved over how large the maps are

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.460 
have raved over how large the maps are
and<00:04:18.359> how<00:04:18.690> that's<00:04:18.870> such<00:04:19.139> a<00:04:19.169> great<00:04:19.440> thing

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
and how that's such a great thing

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.259 
and how that's such a great thing
because<00:04:19.829> the<00:04:20.099> maps<00:04:20.280> in<00:04:20.400> SimCity<00:04:20.760> are<00:04:20.880> so<00:04:21.029> tiny

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
because the maps in SimCity are so tiny

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.420 
because the maps in SimCity are so tiny
but<00:04:21.840> the<00:04:21.900> problem<00:04:22.019> is<00:04:22.260> if<00:04:22.349> you<00:04:22.469> have<00:04:22.500> a<00:04:22.740> very

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
but the problem is if you have a very

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.129 
but the problem is if you have a very
very<00:04:23.669> large<00:04:23.880> map<00:04:24.240> what<00:04:24.389> you<00:04:24.510> do<00:04:24.659> in<00:04:24.840> season

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:25.139 
very large map what you do in season

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:25.480 
very large map what you do in season
motion

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
motion

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.870 
motion
and<00:04:25.729> a<00:04:26.569> very<00:04:26.720> very<00:04:26.930> large<00:04:27.080> city<00:04:27.440> and<00:04:27.710> you<00:04:28.490> spend

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
and a very very large city and you spend

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.790 
and a very very large city and you spend
say<00:04:29.240> like<00:04:29.509> for<00:04:29.750> example<00:04:29.840> I<00:04:30.229> said<00:04:30.470> I'd<00:04:30.560> played

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
say like for example I said I'd played

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.409 
say like for example I said I'd played
this<00:04:30.919> game<00:04:31.099> for<00:04:31.130> 20<00:04:31.490> hours<00:04:31.610> the<00:04:31.759> first<00:04:31.970> six

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:32.419 
this game for 20 hours the first six

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:34.360 
this game for 20 hours the first six
hours<00:04:32.720> that<00:04:32.840> I<00:04:32.900> played<00:04:33.169> were<00:04:33.380> spent<00:04:33.710> trying<00:04:34.160> to

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
hours that I played were spent trying to

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.730 
hours that I played were spent trying to
get<00:04:34.699> and<00:04:35.020> failing<00:04:36.020> and<00:04:36.169> then<00:04:36.259> trying<00:04:36.500> again

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
get and failing and then trying again

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.140 
get and failing and then trying again
and<00:04:36.919> then<00:04:37.039> failing<00:04:37.430> and<00:04:37.639> trying<00:04:37.819> again<00:04:37.970> and

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
and then failing and trying again and

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:39.730 
and then failing and trying again and
trying<00:04:38.750> to<00:04:38.810> figure<00:04:39.020> out<00:04:39.050> how<00:04:39.289> to<00:04:39.349> make<00:04:39.680> a

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
trying to figure out how to make a

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.290 
trying to figure out how to make a
profitable<00:04:40.400> public<00:04:40.729> transportation<00:04:41.270> system

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
profitable public transportation system

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.670 
profitable public transportation system
at<00:04:41.660> all<00:04:41.979> and<00:04:42.979> once<00:04:43.639> I<00:04:44.030> had<00:04:44.509> so<00:04:44.870> much<00:04:45.050> fun<00:04:45.289> doing

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
at all and once I had so much fun doing

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.170 
at all and once I had so much fun doing
that<00:04:45.710> problem-solving<00:04:46.190> figuring<00:04:46.849> out<00:04:46.970> how<00:04:47.120> to

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
that problem-solving figuring out how to

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.650 
that problem-solving figuring out how to
make<00:04:47.330> a<00:04:47.389> profitable<00:04:47.919> transportation<00:04:48.919> system

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
make a profitable transportation system

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.260 
make a profitable transportation system
the<00:04:50.660> next<00:04:51.050> step<00:04:51.259> is<00:04:51.530> to<00:04:52.039> kind<00:04:52.580> of<00:04:52.639> do<00:04:52.880> it<00:04:53.000> again

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
the next step is to kind of do it again

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.180 
the next step is to kind of do it again
and<00:04:53.599> then<00:04:53.870> do<00:04:54.080> it<00:04:54.169> again<00:04:54.199> and<00:04:54.620> do<00:04:54.710> it<00:04:54.740> again<00:04:54.860> and

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
and then do it again and do it again and

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.850 
and then do it again and do it again and
cover<00:04:55.460> the<00:04:55.639> whole<00:04:55.789> city<00:04:56.030> with<00:04:56.240> it<00:04:56.410> but<00:04:57.410> the

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
cover the whole city with it but the

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.559 
cover the whole city with it but the
first<00:04:58.099> time<00:04:58.310> you<00:04:58.370> did<00:04:58.669> it<00:04:58.699> it<00:04:58.880> was<00:04:58.970> exciting

00:04:59.559 --> 00:04:59.569 
first time you did it it was exciting

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:01.089 
first time you did it it was exciting
and<00:04:59.690> new<00:04:59.900> and<00:04:59.930> there<00:05:00.229> was<00:05:00.319> the<00:05:00.440> novelty<00:05:00.860> factor

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:01.099 
and new and there was the novelty factor

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:03.249 
and new and there was the novelty factor
and<00:05:01.490> it<00:05:01.580> was<00:05:01.729> you<00:05:02.180> know<00:05:02.210> there<00:05:02.659> was<00:05:02.780> lots<00:05:03.050> of

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:03.259 
and it was you know there was lots of

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:05.409 
and it was you know there was lots of
looking<00:05:03.889> at<00:05:03.979> little<00:05:04.190> things<00:05:04.370> but<00:05:04.909> the<00:05:05.030> second

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:05.419 
looking at little things but the second

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:08.110 
looking at little things but the second
time<00:05:05.599> you<00:05:05.750> do<00:05:05.870> it<00:05:05.900> it<00:05:06.620> takes<00:05:07.159> a<00:05:07.430> really<00:05:07.940> long

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
time you do it it takes a really long

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.689 
time you do it it takes a really long
time<00:05:08.300> even<00:05:09.169> though<00:05:09.590> you<00:05:09.650> kind<00:05:10.130> of<00:05:10.280> know<00:05:10.490> what

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:10.699 
time even though you kind of know what

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:12.460 
time even though you kind of know what
you<00:05:10.819> want<00:05:11.060> now<00:05:11.270> you<00:05:11.330> can't<00:05:11.659> just<00:05:11.840> go<00:05:11.960> duplicate

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
you want now you can't just go duplicate

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:13.719 
you want now you can't just go duplicate
what<00:05:12.590> you<00:05:12.650> date<00:05:12.830> immediately<00:05:13.340> you<00:05:13.460> have<00:05:13.610> to

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:13.729 
what you date immediately you have to

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:14.800 
what you date immediately you have to
duplicate<00:05:13.940> what<00:05:14.180> you<00:05:14.330> did<00:05:14.449> over<00:05:14.690> eight

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
duplicate what you did over eight

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.020 
duplicate what you did over eight
minutes<00:05:15.020> or<00:05:15.289> 10<00:05:15.440> minutes<00:05:15.470> and<00:05:15.979> then<00:05:16.039> you<00:05:16.729> you

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.030 
minutes or 10 minutes and then you you

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:18.640 
minutes or 10 minutes and then you you
not<00:05:17.449> only<00:05:17.599> have<00:05:17.780> to<00:05:17.810> do<00:05:17.960> blade<00:05:18.110> at<00:05:18.229> once<00:05:18.409> but

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
not only have to do blade at once but

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.110 
not only have to do blade at once but
probably<00:05:18.680> 20<00:05:19.190> times<00:05:19.400> to<00:05:19.669> fill<00:05:19.819> up<00:05:19.880> the<00:05:19.970> whole

probably 20 times to fill up the whole

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.240 
probably 20 times to fill up the whole
map<00:05:20.270> and<00:05:20.539> especially<00:05:21.229> like<00:05:21.590> once<00:05:21.889> you<00:05:22.039> have<00:05:22.220> a

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 
map and especially like once you have a

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:23.379 
map and especially like once you have a
whole<00:05:22.520> map<00:05:22.669> filled<00:05:22.940> with<00:05:23.120> public

transportation<00:05:23.419> lines<00:05:24.110> you<00:05:24.470> end<00:05:24.620> up<00:05:24.740> having

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830 
transportation lines you end up having

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.330 
transportation lines you end up having
like<00:05:25.190> 85<00:05:25.909> lines<00:05:26.270> and<00:05:26.919> you<00:05:27.919> can't<00:05:28.190> remember

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340

00:05:32.649 --> 00:05:32.659 
what line number 17 was um and looking

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:34.439 
what line number 17 was um and looking
through<00:05:32.900> all<00:05:33.080> of<00:05:33.110> them<00:05:33.320> you<00:05:33.469> have<00:05:33.590> to<00:05:33.650> open<00:05:33.919> a

through all of them you have to open a
87<00:05:35.449> windows<00:05:35.900> and<00:05:36.110> look<00:05:36.289> at<00:05:36.409> the<00:05:36.469> profitability

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:36.919 
87 windows and look at the profitability
