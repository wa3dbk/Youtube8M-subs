00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
you look at the bottom number so this

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.140 
you look at the bottom number so this
one<00:02:19.049> here<00:02:19.260> has<00:02:19.409> rolled<00:02:19.650> a<00:02:19.739> two<00:02:19.950> and<00:02:20.219> you<00:02:21.000> will

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
one here has rolled a two and you will

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.490 
one here has rolled a two and you will
take<00:02:21.329> those<00:02:21.510> numbers<00:02:21.840> and<00:02:21.989> then<00:02:22.079> each<00:02:22.200> player

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
take those numbers and then each player

is the winner area 1851 is actually a
fast-paced<00:06:04.030> game<00:06:04.240> I<00:06:04.330> thought<00:06:04.510> it'd<00:06:04.599> be<00:06:04.660> kind

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:04.840 
fast-paced game I thought it'd be kind

fast-paced game I thought it'd be kind
of<00:06:04.900> slow<00:06:05.110> but<00:06:05.320> really<00:06:05.560> players<00:06:06.190> can<00:06:06.460> play

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 
of slow but really players can play

as<00:06:20.620> you<00:06:20.710> decide<00:06:20.979> where<00:06:21.220> to<00:06:21.340> send<00:06:21.490> your

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:21.610

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:23.790 
as you decide where to send your
assistance<00:06:22.180> and<00:06:22.389> but<00:06:22.990> mostly<00:06:23.320> you're<00:06:23.620> going

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:23.800 
assistance and but mostly you're going

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:24.870 
assistance and but mostly you're going
to<00:06:23.860> roll<00:06:23.950> your<00:06:24.130> dice<00:06:24.250> to<00:06:24.520> see<00:06:24.550> what<00:06:24.789> you're

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:24.880 
to roll your dice to see what you're

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.700 
to roll your dice to see what you're
going<00:06:25.000> to<00:06:25.060> build<00:06:25.210> sometimes<00:06:25.960> maybe<00:06:26.110> push<00:06:26.470> your

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:26.710 
going to build sometimes maybe push your

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.620 
going to build sometimes maybe push your
luck<00:06:26.889> or<00:06:27.190> work<00:06:27.760> towards<00:06:28.120> the<00:06:28.270> feats<00:06:28.479> that

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:28.630 
luck or work towards the feats that

you've<00:06:28.870> drawn<00:06:29.289> there's<00:06:29.800> a<00:06:29.860> lot<00:06:30.220> of<00:06:30.250> different

00:06:30.719 --> 00:06:30.729 
you've drawn there's a lot of different

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:31.980 
you've drawn there's a lot of different
things<00:06:30.940> that<00:06:31.030> you<00:06:31.090> can<00:06:31.150> do<00:06:31.360> on<00:06:31.479> a<00:06:31.510> term<00:06:31.750> but<00:06:31.900> you

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:31.990 
things that you can do on a term but you

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:33.330 
things that you can do on a term but you
only<00:06:32.080> have<00:06:32.229> a<00:06:32.289> couple<00:06:32.470> that<00:06:32.800> you<00:06:32.889> really<00:06:33.160> can

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:33.340 
only have a couple that you really can

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.279 
only have a couple that you really can
pull<00:06:33.639> and<00:06:34.030> you<00:06:34.060> have<00:06:34.690> to<00:06:34.810> decide<00:06:35.050> what<00:06:35.200> you're

00:06:35.279 --> 00:06:35.289 
pull and you have to decide what you're

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:36.870 
pull and you have to decide what you're
going<00:06:35.380> to<00:06:35.470> do<00:06:35.620> and<00:06:35.830> sometimes<00:06:36.310> watch<00:06:36.729> what

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:36.880 
going to do and sometimes watch what

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:37.830 
going to do and sometimes watch what
your<00:06:37.000> opponent's<00:06:37.330> doing<00:06:37.510> since<00:06:37.720> you're

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:37.840 
your opponent's doing since you're

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.050 
your opponent's doing since you're
passing<00:06:38.260> in<00:06:38.349> your<00:06:38.530> hand<00:06:38.740> of<00:06:38.890> cards<00:06:39.099> to<00:06:39.760> see<00:06:39.969> if

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:40.060 
passing in your hand of cards to see if

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.110 
passing in your hand of cards to see if
that's<00:06:40.240> worth<00:06:40.539> doing<00:06:40.950> area<00:06:41.950> 1851<00:06:42.580> has<00:06:42.820> a<00:06:42.849> very

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.120 
that's worth doing area 1851 has a very

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.190 
that's worth doing area 1851 has a very
interesting<00:06:43.719> theme<00:06:43.900> one

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:44.200 
interesting theme one

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.260 
interesting theme one
that<00:06:44.290> I<00:06:44.380> think<00:06:44.410> is<00:06:44.770> a<00:06:44.830> pretty<00:06:45.490> neat<00:06:45.730> idea<00:06:46.060> of

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:46.270 
that I think is a pretty neat idea of

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:48.720 
that I think is a pretty neat idea of
cowboys<00:06:47.050> and<00:06:47.200> aliens<00:06:47.470> a<00:06:47.530> nap<00:06:47.740> but<00:06:47.950> at<00:06:48.190> the<00:06:48.370> the

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:48.730 
cowboys and aliens a nap but at the the

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:51.120 
cowboys and aliens a nap but at the the
game's<00:06:48.940> heart<00:06:49.270> it<00:06:49.510> is<00:06:50.080> a<00:06:50.110> very<00:06:50.470> solid<00:06:50.950> game

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:51.130 
game's heart it is a very solid game

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:53.880 
game's heart it is a very solid game
don't<00:06:51.370> let<00:06:51.520> the<00:06:51.670> dice<00:06:52.030> sway<00:06:52.780> you<00:06:52.840> the<00:06:53.620> dice

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:53.890 
don't let the dice sway you the dice

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:56.430 
don't let the dice sway you the dice
more<00:06:54.600> rather<00:06:55.600> than<00:06:55.720> being<00:06:56.020> something<00:06:56.320> that's

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:56.440 
more rather than being something that's

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.710 
more rather than being something that's
very<00:06:56.770> lucky<00:06:57.670> there's<00:06:58.180> something<00:06:58.540> where<00:06:58.690> I

00:06:58.710 --> 00:06:58.720 
very lucky there's something where I

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.480 
very lucky there's something where I
roll<00:06:59.050> them<00:06:59.230> and<00:06:59.380> say<00:06:59.560> okay<00:07:00.010> that's<00:07:00.160> what<00:07:00.400> I've
