 the first thing you need to throw big 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.070

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.460
 important sections 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.659

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.210

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:57.370
 also if you pay attention then 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.589
 notice that there is a special from the top 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.989

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:04.330
 level the number of machines available and 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:07.720
 the amount to fix about which I will tell 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.620
 a little later let's start with the first 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.720
 section menu 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.970

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:27.610
 shows how much you need more 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.909
 wait until you get 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.280
 free bonus cards for arrival 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:36.100
 what we choose one of the available races 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.590
 and immediately throws us into the selection window 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.490
 here you can see a lot of car 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.460
 empty slots 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.530
 this is a place for new cars at will 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.240

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.039
 new slots in which further 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.409
 you can put new 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:53.109
 the cars you purchased 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:55.329
 as for the machines that each of them 

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:58.420
 the end of the race will get experience and 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:02:01.090
 be pumped with every new level you 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.729
 will be able to personally improve one of her 4 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.619
 statisticians notice that every car 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.849
 It can be improved by a total of nine times and 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:11.410
 so make the choice to improve slowly 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.450
 just before the race we are given 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.970
 opportunity to choose some kind of card with 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:19.510

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.700
 proceed to the stage themselves races 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.250
 held with the participation of the user 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.280
 although more precisely, it is recording 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.349
 gong gamblers you can destroy 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.129
 and break all sorts of barricades and barriers 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:32.379
 your way 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:34.450
 truth should not forget that in this 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:36.579
 the game with strong collisions your 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.549
 car breaks down and may explode 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:41.650
 if such a misfortune befell sublimation then 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:42.760
 in order to start for her first you 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.709
 need to pay 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.349
 certain number of wrenches 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.690
 fixes now i'll tell you about hell 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:51.519
 wrenches things fix it kinda 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.340
 items needed for recovery 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:57.579
 cars after the accident also with their help 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.470
 You can replay the race, please note that these 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:02:59.980
 Wrenches get wrong and 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.049
 simply 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.000
 so try not to scatter 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:06.819
 them right and left 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.799
 the pumping your car the more 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.669
 it will require keys from you for your 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:11.739
 recovery 

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:14.440
 in races every player can use 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.250
 acceleration that will help set 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.620
 new records 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.060
 go smooth some turns 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.830
 can be using drift 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:24.930
 so do not forget to use 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:27.990
 as you play you will be able to open different 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.090
 achievements destroy the opponent's car 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:33.170
 reach a speed of two hundred 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.700
 fifteen kilometers per hour and then 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.850
 now let's consider the second tab 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:41.700
 game menu competition at a time here you 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.950
 can get a very good car but 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.530
 for this you need to beat the given 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:49.680
 time in the game paradise through the redriff top and 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.990
 there is another important point all the cars and 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.520
 bonus cards come in several forms 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:58.020
 once you unusual beds and legendary 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.820
 it is clear that each next rare 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.980
 machine has higher 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.560
 characteristics and each next 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:07.680
 rarities card gives its host more 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.690
 the best bonuses in general in these races to us 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.330
 just need to invest in time to 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.040
 get trees 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:16.470
 the third tab of the store menu will allow 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.049
 each of you to buy new ones 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.900
 wheelbarrow cards with bonus sets 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.680
 car repair kits new places 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.230
 in the garage 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.930
 as well as a percentage increase in points for 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.290
 The race in this game is strong enough 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.930
 Dina 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.730
 Of course you can play without pouring in money but 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.700
 then you need to be very careful 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:37.800
 for example if you run out of wrenches 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.810
 keys and you accidentally broke into a race 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.030
 car is very bad for you 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.580
 will end so how to fix your car 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.350
 you can not and when you exit the menu we 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.330
 lose your four-wheeled friend 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.520
 entirely by his progress 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:53.190
 but also the last fourth tab 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.750
 progress will let you know what you are 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.880
 have already received an achievement 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.790
 also in this section you can 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:03.250
 see all the statistics of victory 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:06.100
 caused by the city the distance traveled 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:09.220
 total long drift and so on 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:11.950
 In general, the project is paradise through the gap 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.540
 it's a pretty good game that can 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:16.360
 interest many players 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:18.310
 Yes, there is a Donata shop in the game, but if you 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.040
 careful driver that you can play and 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.810
 without it do not invest real money not 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.540
 I know you will like this racing 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:27.310
 project but I will hope that this is everywhere 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:30.640
