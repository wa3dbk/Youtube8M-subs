00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
it of course but I doubt that I be more

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.910 
it of course but I doubt that I be more
to<00:03:03.980> it<00:03:04.630> they<00:03:05.630> already<00:03:05.989> have<00:03:06.260> a<00:03:06.290> many<00:03:06.530> to<00:03:06.769> know

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
to it they already have a many to know

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.949 
to it they already have a many to know
for<00:03:07.099> the<00:03:07.190> rest<00:03:07.400> of<00:03:07.519> the<00:03:07.670> season<00:03:07.880> and<00:03:08.239> I<00:03:08.599> guess

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
for the rest of the season and I guess

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.620 
for the rest of the season and I guess
that's<00:03:09.170> a<00:03:09.319> natural<00:03:09.580> solution<00:03:10.580> because<00:03:11.269> he<00:03:11.450> was

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
that's a natural solution because he was

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.589 
that's a natural solution because he was
he's<00:03:12.260> been<00:03:12.500> in<00:03:12.620> the<00:03:12.739> club<00:03:12.920> no<00:03:13.130> for<00:03:13.430> the<00:03:14.420> whole

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:14.599 
he's been in the club no for the whole

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:16.990 
he's been in the club no for the whole
season<00:03:14.810> but<00:03:15.709> it<00:03:15.800> is<00:03:15.950> only<00:03:16.130> for<00:03:16.519> the<00:03:16.670> rest<00:03:16.849> of

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
season but it is only for the rest of

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.300 
season but it is only for the rest of
the<00:03:17.120> season<00:03:17.330> and<00:03:17.660> some<00:03:18.500> big-name<00:03:18.709> managers

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310
