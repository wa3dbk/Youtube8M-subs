love this blade this is awesome
it's<00:00:33.710> consider<00:00:34.710> it<00:00:35.070> has<00:00:35.250> considered<00:00:36.980> it<00:00:37.980> has

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
it's consider it has considered it has

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.910 
it's consider it has considered it has
considerably<00:00:38.850> more<00:00:39.120> heft<00:00:39.480> than<00:00:40.230> Aiden<00:00:40.620> Zeca

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
considerably more heft than Aiden Zeca

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.549 
considerably more heft than Aiden Zeca
sushi<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:42.390> much<00:00:42.540> shorter<00:00:42.719> handle<00:00:43.079> which

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
sushi and a much shorter handle which

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.200 
sushi and a much shorter handle which
you<00:00:43.890> might<00:00:44.070> think<00:00:44.399> makes<00:00:44.700> it<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.940> little<00:00:45.000> bit

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
you might think makes it a little bit

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.560 
you might think makes it a little bit
less<00:00:45.690> easy<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.140> wheel<00:00:46.520> but<00:00:47.520> it's<00:00:48.030> really<00:00:48.270> not

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
less easy to wheel but it's really not

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.500 
less easy to wheel but it's really not
and<00:00:48.899> it's<00:00:49.829> not<00:00:49.950> even<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.280> it's<00:00:50.520> so<00:00:50.670> much<00:00:50.820> less

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
and it's not even that it's so much less

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.080 
and it's not even that it's so much less
easy<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.899> wield<00:00:52.230> it's<00:00:52.590> that<00:00:52.860> it's<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:53.969> very

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
easy to wield it's that it's a very

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.410 
easy to wield it's that it's a very
different<00:00:54.300> feel<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:54.989> like<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.760> Zeki<00:00:57.030> sushi

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
different feel to it like the Zeki sushi

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.389 
different feel to it like the Zeki sushi
is<00:00:57.660> very<00:00:58.620> graceful

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
is very graceful

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.689 
is very graceful
you<00:00:59.940> can<00:01:00.199> slash<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.559> then<00:01:01.649> bring<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.160> back<00:01:02.219> and

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
you can slash and then bring it back and

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.840 
you can slash and then bring it back and
you<00:01:03.439> know<00:01:04.439> it's<00:01:04.619> just<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.949> very<00:01:04.979> graceful<00:01:05.339> blade

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
you know it's just a very graceful blade

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.469 
you know it's just a very graceful blade
like<00:01:06.180> you<00:01:06.330> would<00:01:06.450> think<00:01:06.630> any<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:07.860> know

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
like you would think any you know

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.170 
like you would think any you know
Japanese<00:01:09.479> ish<00:01:09.810> sword<00:01:10.140> would<00:01:10.409> be<00:01:11.060> modeled<00:01:12.060> it

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
Japanese ish sword would be modeled it

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:19.370 
Japanese ish sword would be modeled it
after<00:01:12.470> but<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:14.070> Capitan<00:01:14.700> is<00:01:18.049> it<00:01:19.049> lends<00:01:19.290> itself

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
after but the Capitan is it lends itself

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.679 
after but the Capitan is it lends itself
to<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.740> very<00:01:19.950> different<00:01:20.159> fighting<00:01:20.580> style<00:01:20.850> this

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
to a very different fighting style this

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.870 
to a very different fighting style this
is<00:01:21.990> definitely<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.680> much<00:01:22.860> heavier<00:01:23.100> hitter<00:01:23.580> than

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
is definitely a much heavier hitter than

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.330 
is definitely a much heavier hitter than
the<00:01:24.030> desire<00:01:24.240> sushi<00:01:24.890> it's<00:01:25.890> actually

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
the desire sushi it's actually

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.999 
the desire sushi it's actually
quarter-inch<00:01:26.909> steel<00:01:27.200> versus<00:01:28.200> Ayden<00:01:28.650> how<00:01:28.799> long

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
quarter-inch steel versus Ayden how long

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.370 
quarter-inch steel versus Ayden how long
how<00:01:29.340> thick<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.909> exact<00:01:30.750> sushi<00:01:33.380> 204,000

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
how thick is the exact sushi 204,000

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.280 
how thick is the exact sushi 204,000
thick<00:01:35.840> yeah

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
thick yeah

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.030 
thick yeah
so<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:40.240> it's<00:01:40.450> a<00:01:40.750> much<00:01:41.080> thicker<00:01:41.350> blade<00:01:41.680> it<00:01:42.010> is

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
so so it's a much thicker blade it is

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.300 
so so it's a much thicker blade it is
heavier<00:01:42.490> it<00:01:42.820> seems<00:01:43.150> I<00:01:43.650> don't<00:01:44.650> I<00:01:44.890> don't<00:01:44.980> know<00:01:45.280> I

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
heavier it seems I don't I don't know I

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.980 
heavier it seems I don't I don't know I
didn't<00:01:45.610> look<00:01:45.700> at<00:01:45.880> the<00:01:46.030> actual<00:01:46.330> weights<00:01:46.630> of<00:01:46.870> the

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
didn't look at the actual weights of the

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.680 
didn't look at the actual weights of the
blades<00:01:47.260> but<00:01:47.770> it<00:01:48.520> certainly<00:01:48.760> seems<00:01:48.970> heavier

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
blades but it certainly seems heavier

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.110 
blades but it certainly seems heavier
and<00:01:50.160> with<00:01:51.160> the<00:01:51.280> zeka<00:01:51.490> sushi

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.120 
and with the zeka sushi

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.980 
and with the zeka sushi
you<00:01:52.420> really<00:01:52.660> have<00:01:52.810> to<00:01:54.390> you're<00:01:55.390> doing<00:01:55.720> most<00:01:55.900> of

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
you really have to you're doing most of

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.160 
you really have to you're doing most of
the<00:01:56.050> work<00:01:56.110> but<00:01:56.560> with<00:01:57.370> this<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:58.630> blade<00:01:58.870> does<00:01:59.140> a

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
the work but with this the blade does a

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.950 
the work but with this the blade does a
lot<00:01:59.320> of<00:01:59.440> the<00:01:59.500> work<00:01:59.650> for<00:02:00.070> you<00:02:00.250> cuz<00:02:01.210> you<00:02:01.690> just<00:02:01.750> got

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
lot of the work for you cuz you just got

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.480 
lot of the work for you cuz you just got
to<00:02:02.050> bring<00:02:02.200> it<00:02:02.320> up<00:02:02.440> and<00:02:02.560> it'll<00:02:02.950> bring<00:02:03.160> itself

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
to bring it up and it'll bring itself

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.360 
to bring it up and it'll bring itself
down<00:02:03.790> because<00:02:04.090> it's<00:02:04.300> pretty<00:02:04.930> heavy<00:02:05.170> and<00:02:05.290> it<00:02:05.590> it

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
down because it's pretty heavy and it it

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.570 
down because it's pretty heavy and it it
is<00:02:06.490> very<00:02:07.020> versatile<00:02:08.020> you<00:02:08.080> can<00:02:08.340> use<00:02:09.340> it<00:02:09.490> in

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
is very versatile you can use it in

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:16.350 
is very versatile you can use it in
really<00:02:09.760> close<00:02:10.000> quarters<00:02:10.420> I<00:02:10.540> guess<00:02:10.980> and<00:02:15.210> yeah<00:02:16.210> I

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
really close quarters I guess and yeah I

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.420 
really close quarters I guess and yeah I
like<00:02:16.570> that<00:02:16.780> it<00:02:16.900> has<00:02:17.050> the<00:02:17.380> little<00:02:17.950> bit<00:02:18.280> of<00:02:18.370> a

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
like that it has the little bit of a

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.210 
like that it has the little bit of a
hand<00:02:18.640> guard<00:02:18.880> here<00:02:19.360> I<00:02:20.230> think<00:02:20.860> that's<00:02:20.980> one<00:02:21.190> of

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
hand guard here I think that's one of

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.670 
hand guard here I think that's one of
maybe<00:02:21.880> two<00:02:22.180> zombie<00:02:22.660> tools<00:02:22.870> the<00:02:23.170> moment<00:02:23.470> that

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
maybe two zombie tools the moment that

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.440 
maybe two zombie tools the moment that
have<00:02:24.130> that<00:02:24.400> hand<00:02:24.640> guard<00:02:24.880> this<00:02:25.090> and<00:02:25.240> the<00:02:25.300> bone

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
have that hand guard this and the bone
