once again bored third prototype of a
boat<00:01:09.270> yeah<00:01:09.810> first<00:01:10.710> one<00:01:10.830> made<00:01:11.040> out<00:01:11.159> of<00:01:11.280> notebook

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
boat yeah first one made out of notebook

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.380 
boat yeah first one made out of notebook
yeah<00:01:12.030> battery<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.380> motor<00:01:13.560> connected<00:01:14.310> to

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
yeah battery to the motor connected to

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.450 
yeah battery to the motor connected to
well<00:01:15.390> basically<00:01:15.869> switch<00:01:16.290> here<00:01:16.560> second<00:01:17.340> one

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
well basically switch here second one

well basically switch here second one
made<00:01:17.610> out<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.939> ice<00:01:18.420> cream<00:01:18.450> cub<00:01:19.100> third<00:01:20.100> one

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
made out of the ice cream cub third one

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.760 
made out of the ice cream cub third one
I<00:01:20.520> just<00:01:21.000> found<00:01:21.299> this<00:01:21.509> awesome<00:01:21.780> Hank<00:01:22.140> just

I just found this awesome Hank just

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.960 
I just found this awesome Hank just
build<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.070> boat<00:01:23.220> how<00:01:23.460> do<00:01:23.520> we<00:01:23.729> cut<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:25.700> yeah<00:01:26.700> we

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
build a boat how do we cut it yeah we

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.499 
build a boat how do we cut it yeah we
just<00:01:27.180> snap<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.990> front<00:01:30.320> well<00:01:31.320> that'd<00:01:31.860> be<00:01:31.890> okay

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
just snap the front well that'd be okay

but the other side of the cage sugar so
we've<00:01:41.700> got<00:01:41.939> motor<00:01:42.240> here<00:01:43.159> esc<00:01:44.210> connects<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.509> the

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
we've got motor here esc connects to the

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.190 
we've got motor here esc connects to the
battery<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.350> while<00:01:47.130> we're<00:01:47.850> all<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.299> way<00:01:48.329> to

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
battery and while we're all the way to

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.600 
battery and while we're all the way to
the<00:01:49.290> back<00:01:49.439> here<00:01:49.740> which<00:01:49.860> is<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.159> stand<00:01:50.399> most

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
the back here which is to stand most

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.160 
the back here which is to stand most
standard<00:01:51.000> battery<00:01:51.329> at<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.479> half<00:01:51.689> on<00:01:52.670> AC<00:01:53.670> a

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
standard battery at a half on AC a

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.720 
standard battery at a half on AC a
receiver<00:01:55.170> connected<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:56.670> this

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:58.730 
receiver connected to this

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.710 
receiver connected to this
in<00:01:59.000> there<00:01:59.150> somewhere<00:01:59.510> all<00:02:00.260> off<00:02:00.440> switch<00:02:01.600> and<00:02:02.600> it

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
in there somewhere all off switch and it

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.210 
in there somewhere all off switch and it
turns<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:03.230> whole<00:02:03.350> thing<00:02:03.590> on<00:02:03.710> a<00:02:03.740> lot<00:02:03.920> phone

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
turns the whole thing on a lot phone

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.500 
turns the whole thing on a lot phone
like<00:02:04.460> and<00:02:04.730> they're<00:02:04.910> ready

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
like and they're ready

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:11.290 
like and they're ready
listen<00:02:08.200> and<00:02:09.200> life<00:02:09.500> bleeds<00:02:09.860> not<00:02:10.190> so<00:02:11.150> yeah

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
listen and life bleeds not so yeah

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.290 
listen and life bleeds not so yeah
that's<00:02:11.570> basically<00:02:11.810> and<00:02:12.350> then<00:02:12.470> the<00:02:12.980> SE<00:02:13.370> you

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
that's basically and then the SE you

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.120 
that's basically and then the SE you
point<00:02:14.960> of<00:02:15.080> this<00:02:15.200> is<00:02:15.380> you<00:02:15.530> could<00:02:15.680> control<00:02:15.980> the

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
point of this is you could control the

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.600 
point of this is you could control the
speed<00:02:16.340> of<00:02:16.370> this<00:02:16.720> so<00:02:17.720> if<00:02:18.470> I<00:02:18.620> can<00:02:18.800> get<00:02:19.280> controller

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
speed of this so if I can get controller

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.200 
speed of this so if I can get controller
you<00:02:20.090> can<00:02:20.150> show<00:02:21.050> how<00:02:21.200> fast<00:02:21.440> how<00:02:22.310> much<00:02:22.460> electric

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
you can show how fast how much electric

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.210 
you can show how fast how much electric
is<00:02:23.390> flowing<00:02:23.660> through<00:02:23.810> here<00:02:23.960> to<00:02:24.170> model<00:02:24.380> how

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
is flowing through here to model how

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.060 
is flowing through here to model how
fast<00:02:25.430> this<00:02:25.580> spins<00:02:26.060> so<00:02:26.930> all<00:02:27.110> of<00:02:27.260> this<00:02:27.350> is<00:02:27.860> to

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
fast this spins so all of this is to

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.570 
fast this spins so all of this is to
control<00:02:28.250> how<00:02:28.460> fast<00:02:28.640> this<00:02:28.820> goes<00:02:30.190> with<00:02:31.190> burning

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
control how fast this goes with burning

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.730 
control how fast this goes with burning
some<00:02:31.820> plastic<00:02:32.720> do<00:02:33.200> you<00:02:33.410> need<00:02:33.560> it<00:02:33.680> -<00:02:33.890> um<00:02:35.470> well<00:02:36.470> be

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
some plastic do you need it - um well be

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.800 
some plastic do you need it - um well be
that<00:02:36.830> lighter<00:02:37.070> yeah<00:02:37.460> burn<00:02:38.030> the<00:02:38.150> plastic<00:02:38.330> as
