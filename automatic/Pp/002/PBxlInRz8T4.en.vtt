00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
more but it's not the price i'm not sure

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.770 
more but it's not the price i'm not sure
why<00:02:07.409> but<00:02:08.399> this<00:02:08.610> is<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.179> second<00:02:09.629> most

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
why but this is the second most

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.460 
why but this is the second most
expensive<00:02:10.020> a<00:02:11.629> pistol

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
expensive a pistol

has 20 to 60 ammo I believe or 20 to 80
I'm<00:03:25.350> not<00:03:25.530> sure<00:03:25.709> it's<00:03:25.920> probably<00:03:26.280> 2860<00:03:27.060> but<00:03:27.269> so

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
I'm not sure it's probably 2860 but so

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.750 
I'm not sure it's probably 2860 but so
it<00:03:27.900> has<00:03:28.019> really<00:03:28.530> nice<00:03:28.709> amateur<00:03:29.040> a<00:03:29.400> shin<00:03:29.550> this

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
it has really nice amateur a shin this

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.000 
it has really nice amateur a shin this

like a deagle or anaconda where if
you're<00:03:35.519> pretty<00:03:35.760> good<00:03:35.940> and<00:03:36.060> pistol<00:03:36.510> and<00:03:36.720> you

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
you're pretty good and pistol and you

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.640 
you're pretty good and pistol and you
don't<00:03:37.650> die<00:03:37.890> a<00:03:37.920> lot<00:03:39.200> you're<00:03:40.200> going<00:03:40.350> to<00:03:40.440> run<00:03:40.590> out

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
out animal pretty soon with the deagle

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.100 
out animal pretty soon with the deagle
or<00:03:42.660> anaconda<00:03:43.260> but<00:03:43.950> this<00:03:44.299> this<00:03:45.299> is<00:03:45.360> really<00:03:45.900> has

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
or anaconda but this this is really has

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.250 
or anaconda but this this is really has
a<00:03:46.140> nice<00:03:46.470> a<00:03:46.769> lot<00:03:47.430> of<00:03:47.549> ammo<00:03:47.760> so<00:03:48.480> the<00:03:48.720> a<00:03:48.750> moderation

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
is great also a triple fire rate which

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.210 
is great also a triple fire rate which
can<00:03:53.670> help<00:03:53.940> you<00:03:54.060> sometimes<00:03:54.510> I<00:03:55.010> don't<00:03:56.010> really

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
know why anybody would want to use the

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.310 
know why anybody would want to use the
triple<00:03:58.709> fire<00:03:58.980> eat<00:03:59.420> nor<00:04:00.420> what<00:04:00.630> I<00:04:00.660> know<00:04:01.110> why

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
triple fire eat nor what I know why

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.900 
triple fire eat nor what I know why
would<00:04:01.530> anybody<00:04:01.739> want<00:04:02.100> to<00:04:02.160> use<00:04:02.280> this<00:04:02.430> pistol<00:04:02.820> in

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
would anybody want to use this pistol in

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.560 
would anybody want to use this pistol in
the<00:04:02.940> first<00:04:03.209> place<00:04:04.820> but<00:04:05.820> yeah<00:04:06.120> it<00:04:06.239> does<00:04:06.390> have

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
the first place but yeah it does have

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.270 
the first place but yeah it does have
that<00:04:06.720> triple<00:04:07.230> fire<00:04:07.470> rate<00:04:07.650> option<00:04:07.830> if<00:04:08.100> you're

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
that triple fire rate option if you're

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.970 
that triple fire rate option if you're
not<00:04:08.400> really<00:04:08.670> a<00:04:08.790> good<00:04:09.150> single<00:04:10.049> shot<00:04:10.440> kind<00:04:10.920> of

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
not really a good single shot kind of

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.380 
not really a good single shot kind of
like<00:04:11.100> me<00:04:11.570> then<00:04:13.430> just<00:04:14.430> switch<00:04:14.910> to<00:04:14.940> the<00:04:15.150> triple

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
like me then just switch to the triple

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.560 
like me then just switch to the triple
fire<00:04:15.690> and<00:04:16.049> try<00:04:16.650> to<00:04:17.580> get<00:04:17.760> a<00:04:17.790> head<00:04:18.000> shot<00:04:18.030> with<00:04:18.419> it

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
fire and try to get a head shot with it

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.330 
fire and try to get a head shot with it
because<00:04:18.690> the<00:04:18.930> recoil<00:04:19.290> does<00:04:19.470> bring<00:04:19.739> it<00:04:19.890> up<00:04:20.959> but

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
because the recoil does bring it up but

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.330 
because the recoil does bring it up but
yeah<00:04:23.340> just<00:04:23.820> about<00:04:24.479> distinct<00:04:25.229> terrible<00:04:25.590> you

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
yeah just about distinct terrible you

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.320 
yeah just about distinct terrible you
know<00:04:26.400> obviously

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
know obviously

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.809 
know obviously
the<00:04:27.389> bad<00:04:27.569> thing<00:04:27.599> is<00:04:27.900> a<00:04:30.169> two-shot<00:04:31.169> headshot

00:04:31.809 --> 00:04:31.819 
the bad thing is a two-shot headshot

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:36.820 
the bad thing is a two-shot headshot
that's<00:04:32.819> already<00:04:33.120> like<00:04:33.479> crappy<00:04:34.289> right<00:04:34.650> there

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
that's already like crappy right there

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:46.059 
that's already like crappy right there
so<00:04:38.689> it's<00:04:39.689> not<00:04:39.870> powerful<00:04:40.080> at<00:04:40.500> all<00:04:41.300> so<00:04:44.000> yeah

00:04:46.059 --> 00:04:46.069 
so it's not powerful at all so yeah

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:48.700 
so it's not powerful at all so yeah
there<00:04:47.069> it<00:04:47.250> has<00:04:47.460> a<00:04:47.490> fast<00:04:47.879> reload<00:04:48.270> rate

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
there it has a fast reload rate

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.860 
there it has a fast reload rate
definitely<00:04:49.710> faster<00:04:49.979> than<00:04:50.460> the<00:04:50.669> deagle<00:04:51.539> that's

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
definitely faster than the deagle that's

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.629 
definitely faster than the deagle that's
for<00:04:52.080> sure<00:04:54.139> probably<00:04:55.139> faster<00:04:55.530> than<00:04:55.710> anaconda

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 
for sure probably faster than anaconda

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:00.110 
for sure probably faster than anaconda
looks<00:04:56.879> like<00:04:57.090> um<00:04:58.520> yeah<00:04:59.520> I<00:04:59.550> don't<00:04:59.699> know<00:04:59.849> there's
