00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.109
 the beauty people like you 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:11.160
 if you solve the problem of using the cpu instead 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:13.049
 when to use 100% in case you use 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.379
 for staying at 5% 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:20.010
 when using laptops or on the battery 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.189
 when I used it in the light or on the 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.189
 power plug 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.670
 he kept the percentage is normal 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:31.470
 when used only on the battery to connect 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:33.510
 in taking he was 5 with 11% of that 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:38.489
 show where it solves the problem 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:42.329
 the Start Menu Control Panel 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.829
 the pain of energy sounds 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.750
 You will choose the plan that you 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.210
 use the goal is to score I got here 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.950
 change plan settings 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.079
 if you have economic zone when 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.980
 miner will come here all me 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.510
 balancing comes here to see in 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.710
 change power settings 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.660
 come up only the one you come 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.409
 power management. 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:10.700
 processing the state minimum performance 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.650
 you will not mess around 5 percent 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:17.580
 being maximum performance you too 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:20.509
 It will not mess around let it know 100% here. 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.750
 system cooling directive 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:24.119
 renal 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.820
 The problem is that in my here or at 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.490
 fact the battery is all passive 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.610
 instead I used only on the battery and I use the 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.979
 cimpor lusa was fixed at 5% 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.500
 so always keep the battery active 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.630
 in the outlet 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:44.759
 the two became either passive or 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:46.860
 if any of them are in the passive the 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.070
 what will happen and how it will look to a 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:54.479
 being used and 100% in surgical use 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:56.700
 is 100% so always leave a battery in the 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.860
 active outlet 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.540
 At least here, I hope. 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.540
 It helped. Thanks.
