Oh<00:03:31.800> is<00:03:32.430> out<00:03:32.580> of<00:03:32.610> bounds<00:03:34.670> so<00:03:35.670> anyways<00:03:36.150> that's

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
Oh is out of bounds so anyways that's

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.360 
Oh is out of bounds so anyways that's
how<00:03:36.450> the<00:03:36.510> that's<00:03:37.260> all<00:03:37.380> the<00:03:37.470> game<00:03:37.620> works<00:03:37.830> that
