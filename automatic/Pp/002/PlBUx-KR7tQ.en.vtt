00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
packaging squeezy tubes so you don't

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.090 
packaging squeezy tubes so you don't
have<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.180> deal<00:01:54.299> with<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.450> bottle<00:01:54.990> it's<00:01:55.979> also

very lightweight the packaging is

very very lightweight cream and it says
that<00:02:08.740> it's<00:02:08.890> matte<00:02:09.100> I<00:02:09.490> don't<00:02:10.300> find<00:02:10.630> it<00:02:10.780> to<00:02:10.810> be

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
that it's matte I don't find it to be

that it's matte I don't find it to be
super<00:02:12.430> matte<00:02:12.790> like<00:02:13.740> the<00:02:14.740> resist<00:02:15.130> ultra<00:02:15.610> light

super matte like the resist ultra light
tinted<00:02:17.410> sunscreen<00:02:17.650> if<00:02:18.520> that's<00:02:18.760> the<00:02:18.880> name<00:02:19.030> of

tinted sunscreen if that's the name of
it<00:02:19.300> is<00:02:19.620> super<00:02:20.620> super<00:02:20.770> mattes<00:02:21.100> I<00:02:21.430> don't<00:02:21.880> find

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
it is super super mattes I don't find

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.850 
it is super super mattes I don't find
this<00:02:22.180> to<00:02:22.330> be<00:02:22.360> really<00:02:22.480> mad<00:02:23.050> I<00:02:23.230> think<00:02:23.290> this<00:02:23.680> is

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
this to be really mad I think this is

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.280 
this to be really mad I think this is
kind<00:02:24.160> of<00:02:24.280> like<00:02:24.600> kind<00:02:25.600> of<00:02:25.720> like<00:02:25.810> the<00:02:25.989> Hydra

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
kind of like kind of like the Hydra

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.930 
kind of like kind of like the Hydra
light<00:02:26.410> sunscreen<00:02:26.680> they<00:02:27.220> say<00:02:27.400> that<00:02:27.580> that<00:02:27.610> has<00:02:27.880> a

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
light sunscreen they say that that has a

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.280 
light sunscreen they say that that has a
matte<00:02:28.150> finish<00:02:28.180> but<00:02:28.630> I<00:02:28.660> don't<00:02:28.840> think<00:02:28.989> it<00:02:29.080> does

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
matte finish but I don't think it does

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.910 
matte finish but I don't think it does
it's<00:02:29.950> just<00:02:30.190> not<00:02:30.489> it's<00:02:31.330> not<00:02:31.510> dewy<00:02:31.900> but<00:02:32.650> it's<00:02:32.770> not

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
it's just not it's not dewy but it's not

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.680 
it's just not it's not dewy but it's not
matte<00:02:33.130> either<00:02:33.370> it's<00:02:33.640> like<00:02:33.820> it's<00:02:34.390> kind<00:02:34.540> of<00:02:34.570> in

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
matte either it's like it's kind of in

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:35.550 
matte either it's like it's kind of in
between<00:02:34.720> there's<00:02:35.110> a<00:02:35.200> little<00:02:35.380> bit<00:02:35.470> of

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
between there's a little bit of

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.050 
between there's a little bit of
shininess<00:02:35.860> but<00:02:36.700> it's<00:02:37.030> not<00:02:37.560> like<00:02:38.820> oily<00:02:39.820> shiny

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
shininess but it's not like oily shiny

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.270 
shininess but it's not like oily shiny
so<00:02:40.690> I<00:02:40.720> don't<00:02:41.470> necessarily<00:02:41.620> think<00:02:41.980> that<00:02:42.160> the

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
so I don't necessarily think that the

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.150 
so I don't necessarily think that the
name<00:02:42.700> is<00:02:42.850> appropriate<00:02:43.320> but<00:02:44.320> the<00:02:44.650> product<00:02:45.070> is

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
name is appropriate but the product is

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.050 
name is appropriate but the product is
really<00:02:45.459> really<00:02:45.610> good

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
really really good

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.550 
really really good
and<00:02:46.150> if<00:02:46.540> you<00:02:46.660> set<00:02:46.840> it<00:02:46.870> with<00:02:47.050> a<00:02:47.080> little<00:02:47.440> bit<00:02:47.530> of

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
and if you set it with a little bit of

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.590 
and if you set it with a little bit of
powder<00:02:47.830> than<00:02:48.040> it<00:02:48.160> does<00:02:48.340> obviously<00:02:48.670> turn<00:02:49.390> to<00:02:49.570> a

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
powder than it does obviously turn to a

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.390 
powder than it does obviously turn to a
matte<00:02:49.750> finish<00:02:49.900> I<00:02:50.140> have<00:02:50.290> it<00:02:50.380> on<00:02:50.440> today<00:02:50.680> with

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
matte finish I have it on today with

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.699 
matte finish I have it on today with
just<00:02:51.640> a<00:02:51.790> little<00:02:51.940> bit<00:02:52.120> of<00:02:52.209> powder<00:02:52.420> to<00:02:53.290> get<00:02:53.590> rid

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
just a little bit of powder to get rid

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:54.870 
just a little bit of powder to get rid
of<00:02:53.769> the<00:02:53.860> shininess<00:02:54.160> and<00:02:54.310> I<00:02:54.550> don't<00:02:54.730> usually

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
of the shininess and I don't usually

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.449 
of the shininess and I don't usually
wear<00:02:55.150> powder<00:02:55.420> especially<00:02:56.019> in<00:02:56.980> the<00:02:57.160> colder

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
wear powder especially in the colder

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:58.710 
wear powder especially in the colder
months<00:02:57.489> but<00:02:57.880> when<00:02:58.090> I'm<00:02:58.180> in<00:02:58.330> front<00:02:58.450> of<00:02:58.630> these

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
months but when I'm in front of these

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.330 
months but when I'm in front of these
these<00:02:59.170> lights<00:02:59.440> I<00:02:59.620> do<00:02:59.680> because<00:03:00.010> everything

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
these lights I do because everything

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.479 
these lights I do because everything
gets<00:03:00.580> so<00:03:00.760> shiny<00:03:01.090> so<00:03:01.739> sheer<00:03:02.739> Matt<00:03:02.890> 10<00:03:03.130> really

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
gets so shiny so sheer Matt 10 really

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.940 
gets so shiny so sheer Matt 10 really
really<00:03:03.670> good<00:03:04.200> downside<00:03:05.200> however<00:03:05.650> is<00:03:05.739> that<00:03:05.860> it

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
really good downside however is that it

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.350 
really good downside however is that it
only<00:03:06.100> comes<00:03:06.370> in<00:03:06.489> four<00:03:06.700> colors<00:03:06.730> which<00:03:07.209> is<00:03:07.329> a

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
only comes in four colors which is a

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.180 
only comes in four colors which is a
bummer<00:03:07.630> for<00:03:07.870> someone<00:03:08.530> like<00:03:08.650> me<00:03:08.890> that's

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
bummer for someone like me that's

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.740 
bummer for someone like me that's
usually<00:03:09.519> a<00:03:09.579> problem<00:03:09.790> because<00:03:10.060> the<00:03:10.450> lightest

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
usually a problem because the lightest

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.020 
usually a problem because the lightest
shades<00:03:10.959> are<00:03:11.200> usually<00:03:11.769> not<00:03:11.890> light<00:03:12.100> enough<00:03:12.130> this

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
shades are usually not light enough this

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.370 
shades are usually not light enough this
is<00:03:13.209> the<00:03:13.329> lightest<00:03:13.630> shade<00:03:13.690> its<00:03:14.049> shape<00:03:14.260> number

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
is the lightest shade its shape number

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:15.569 
is the lightest shade its shape number
one<00:03:14.650> I<00:03:14.680> believe<00:03:14.890> it's<00:03:15.130> called<00:03:15.250> porcelain

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
one I believe it's called porcelain

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:17.910 
one I believe it's called porcelain
anything<00:03:16.299> it's<00:03:16.420> slightly<00:03:16.959> slightly<00:03:17.799> on<00:03:17.890> the

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
anything it's slightly slightly on the

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.310 
anything it's slightly slightly on the
yellow<00:03:18.160> side<00:03:18.400> but<00:03:18.790> I<00:03:19.120> don't<00:03:19.840> really<00:03:19.959> find<00:03:20.230> it

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
yellow side but I don't really find it

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.660 
yellow side but I don't really find it
to<00:03:20.380> be<00:03:20.470> a<00:03:20.530> problem<00:03:20.769> because<00:03:20.950> the<00:03:21.130> coverage<00:03:21.489> is

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
to be a problem because the coverage is

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.420 
to be a problem because the coverage is
not<00:03:21.850> so<00:03:22.150> substantial<00:03:22.780> that<00:03:23.500> it<00:03:23.709> creates<00:03:24.130> a

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
not so substantial that it creates a

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.990 
not so substantial that it creates a
really<00:03:24.790> strong<00:03:25.380> cast<00:03:26.380> of<00:03:26.590> color<00:03:26.820> and<00:03:27.820> I<00:03:27.940> do

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
really strong cast of color and I do

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.280 
really strong cast of color and I do
find<00:03:28.269> that<00:03:28.299> my<00:03:28.420> face<00:03:28.630> is<00:03:28.810> a<00:03:28.840> little<00:03:28.989> bit<00:03:29.170> more

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
find that my face is a little bit more

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.229 
find that my face is a little bit more
yellow<00:03:29.440> than<00:03:29.709> my<00:03:29.920> my<00:03:30.430> neck<00:03:30.610> and<00:03:30.790> chest<00:03:30.940> anyway

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
yellow than my my neck and chest anyway

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:32.970 
yellow than my my neck and chest anyway
so<00:03:31.780> the<00:03:31.870> people<00:03:32.110> who<00:03:32.230> would<00:03:32.350> like<00:03:32.410> this<00:03:32.799> I

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
so the people who would like this I

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.830 
so the people who would like this I
think<00:03:33.280> are<00:03:33.519> people<00:03:33.910> who<00:03:34.120> don't<00:03:34.480> like<00:03:34.630> to<00:03:34.660> wear

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
think are people who don't like to wear

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.270 
think are people who don't like to wear
foundation<00:03:35.440> but<00:03:35.620> still<00:03:35.890> want<00:03:36.070> to<00:03:36.130> wear

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
foundation but still want to wear

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.310 
foundation but still want to wear
sunscreen<00:03:36.579> and<00:03:37.090> like<00:03:37.630> the<00:03:37.750> idea<00:03:37.959> of<00:03:38.049> having<00:03:38.170> a

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
sunscreen and like the idea of having a

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.539 
sunscreen and like the idea of having a
little<00:03:38.530> bit<00:03:38.590> of<00:03:38.709> coverage<00:03:38.980> I<00:03:39.160> think<00:03:39.190> you<00:03:39.430> would

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
little bit of coverage I think you would

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:41.220 
little bit of coverage I think you would
really<00:03:39.670> like<00:03:39.850> it<00:03:40.060> because<00:03:40.480> it<00:03:40.690> is<00:03:40.720> so

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
really like it because it is so

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.199 
really like it because it is so
lightweight<00:03:41.560> and<00:03:42.040> it<00:03:42.489> does<00:03:42.670> have<00:03:42.910> just<00:03:43.150> a

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
lightweight and it does have just a

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.449 
lightweight and it does have just a
small<00:03:43.360> amount<00:03:43.510> of<00:03:43.810> coverage<00:03:44.079> it's<00:03:44.709> enough<00:03:45.070> to

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
small amount of coverage it's enough to

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.100 
small amount of coverage it's enough to
even<00:03:45.760> out<00:03:45.850> your<00:03:45.880> skin<00:03:46.000> tone<00:03:46.209> but<00:03:46.570> it's<00:03:46.720> not<00:03:46.870> so

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
even out your skin tone but it's not so

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.949 
even out your skin tone but it's not so
much<00:03:47.320> that<00:03:47.650> it's<00:03:47.890> cakey<00:03:48.760> and<00:03:48.940> weird<00:03:49.209> which

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
much that it's cakey and weird which

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.470 
much that it's cakey and weird which
lately<00:03:50.530> I've<00:03:50.709> really<00:03:50.980> just<00:03:51.010> really<00:03:51.970> been<00:03:52.090> into

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
lately I've really just really been into

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.380 
lately I've really just really been into

I have not been wearing that much makeup

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.720 
I have not been wearing that much makeup
all<00:03:58.959> winter<00:03:59.200> which<00:03:59.590> it's<00:04:00.190> kind<00:04:00.370> of<00:04:00.400> normal

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
all winter which it's kind of normal

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.520 
all winter which it's kind of normal
because<00:04:00.820> my<00:04:01.000> skin<00:04:01.239> gets<00:04:01.450> really<00:04:01.720> really

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
because my skin gets really really

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.979 
because my skin gets really really
unhappy<00:04:02.920> in<00:04:03.160> the<00:04:03.220> winter<00:04:03.459> but<00:04:03.989> very

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
unhappy in the winter but very

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:07.560 
unhappy in the winter but very
lightweight<00:04:05.609> with<00:04:06.609> good<00:04:06.880> coverage<00:04:07.299> still

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:07.570 
lightweight with good coverage still

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:10.350 
lightweight with good coverage still
like<00:04:07.810> enough<00:04:08.230> coverage<00:04:08.590> to<00:04:08.920> even<00:04:09.220> out<00:04:09.360> minor

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
like enough coverage to even out minor

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.000 
like enough coverage to even out minor
imperfections<00:04:10.660> and<00:04:11.230> just<00:04:11.440> to<00:04:11.590> make<00:04:11.709> your<00:04:11.860> face

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010

look nice
bonus<00:04:13.660> is<00:04:13.900> that

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
bonus is that

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.259 
bonus is that
SPF<00:04:14.560> 30<00:04:14.830> so<00:04:15.010> it's<00:04:15.129> the<00:04:15.220> same<00:04:15.400> SPF<00:04:15.849> rating<00:04:16.030> as

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
SPF 30 so it's the same SPF rating as

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:17.759 
SPF 30 so it's the same SPF rating as
all<00:04:16.479> the<00:04:16.660> other<00:04:16.840> policy<00:04:17.290> choice<00:04:17.500> facial

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
the way that we're supposed to apply

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.029 
the way that we're supposed to apply
sunscreen<00:04:57.699> like<00:04:58.360> usually<00:04:58.780> to<00:04:59.020> apply<00:04:59.289> the

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:00.039 
sunscreen like usually to apply the

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:01.830 
sunscreen like usually to apply the
amount<00:05:00.310> of<00:05:00.430> foundation<00:05:01.180> that<00:05:01.240> you<00:05:01.389> would<00:05:01.539> need

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
amount of foundation that you would need

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.110 
amount of foundation that you would need
to<00:05:02.199> get<00:05:02.410> the<00:05:02.530> SPF<00:05:02.680> rating<00:05:03.190> on<00:05:03.490> the<00:05:03.610> bottle<00:05:03.940> is

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
to get the SPF rating on the bottle is

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.050 
to get the SPF rating on the bottle is
kind<00:05:04.750> of<00:05:04.840> ridiculous<00:05:05.169> but<00:05:06.100> with<00:05:06.490> this<00:05:06.639> one<00:05:06.850> I

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
kind of ridiculous but with this one I

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.820 
kind of ridiculous but with this one I
don't<00:05:07.150> find<00:05:07.630> that<00:05:07.750> it's<00:05:07.900> a<00:05:07.990> problem<00:05:08.260> because

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
don't find that it's a problem because

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.040 
don't find that it's a problem because
it's<00:05:09.010> so<00:05:09.220> lightweight<00:05:09.460> that<00:05:09.940> using<00:05:10.389> a<00:05:10.510> large

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:12.540 
it's so lightweight that using a large
enough<00:05:11.260> amount<00:05:11.590> of<00:05:11.710> it<00:05:11.800> to<00:05:11.919> get<00:05:12.039> the<00:05:12.100> SPF

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
enough amount of it to get the SPF

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.420 
enough amount of it to get the SPF
rating<00:05:12.729> doesn't<00:05:13.690> make<00:05:13.840> my<00:05:13.960> face<00:05:14.289> look<00:05:14.530> cakey
