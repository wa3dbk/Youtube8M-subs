types of gears found in the ev3 kit most
of<00:00:09.010> them<00:00:09.130> are<00:00:09.450> named<00:00:10.450> after<00:00:10.719> the<00:00:11.410> number<00:00:11.679> of

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:11.830 
of them are named after the number of

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.070 
of them are named after the number of
teeth<00:00:12.070> that<00:00:12.099> they<00:00:12.519> have<00:00:12.730> the<00:00:13.360> smallest<00:00:13.749> here

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:14.080 
teeth that they have the smallest here

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.349 
teeth that they have the smallest here
is<00:00:14.230> an<00:00:14.530> 8<00:00:14.740> tooth

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:45.590 

there<00:00:19.359> are<00:00:19.630> 2<00:00:20.140> 12<00:00:20.679> tooth<00:00:31.259> there<00:00:32.259> is<00:00:32.470> a<00:00:32.680> 16<00:00:33.310> to<00:00:39.180> 22

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:55.639 

24<00:00:46.600> tooth

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:11.340 

8:36<00:00:56.649> tooth<00:00:56.980> gear<00:01:00.360> and<00:01:02.220> a<00:01:03.220> 40-tooth<00:01:04.030> gear<00:01:10.350> then

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
8:36 tooth gear and a 40-tooth gear then

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.010 
8:36 tooth gear and a 40-tooth gear then
these<00:01:11.500> first<00:01:11.830> set<00:01:12.070> of<00:01:12.250> gears<00:01:12.640> I'll<00:01:13.360> highlight

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
these first set of gears I'll highlight

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.859 
these first set of gears I'll highlight
a<00:01:14.200> couple<00:01:14.290> of<00:01:14.590> these<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:19.540> ones<00:01:19.720> I've

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
a couple of these the ones I've

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:23.249 
a couple of these the ones I've
highlighted<00:01:20.080> there<00:01:20.590> are<00:01:20.830> bevel<00:01:21.790> gears<00:01:22.259> bevel

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259 
highlighted there are bevel gears bevel

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.210 
highlighted there are bevel gears bevel
gears<00:01:23.560> have<00:01:24.479> rounded<00:01:25.479> edges<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:26.860> the<00:01:26.979> gear

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
gears have rounded edges to the gear

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.820 
gears have rounded edges to the gear
this<00:01:27.940> means<00:01:28.210> not<00:01:28.450> only<00:01:28.479> can<00:01:29.080> it<00:01:29.500> fit<00:01:29.680> together

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
this means not only can it fit together

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.639 
this means not only can it fit together
like<00:01:30.220> this<00:01:30.460> but<00:01:31.149> it<00:01:31.270> can<00:01:31.360> also<00:01:31.600> fit<00:01:32.350> together

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:32.649 
like this but it can also fit together

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:37.710 
like this but it can also fit together
at<00:01:33.179> angles<00:01:34.200> up<00:01:35.200> to<00:01:35.560> 90<00:01:36.100> degrees<00:01:36.460> and<00:01:36.720> still

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
at angles up to 90 degrees and still

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.980 
at angles up to 90 degrees and still
function<00:01:38.200> this<00:01:39.039> allows<00:01:39.399> the<00:01:39.700> gear<00:01:40.060> to<00:01:40.509> change

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
function this allows the gear to change

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:47.450 
function this allows the gear to change
the<00:01:41.229> direction<00:01:41.800> of<00:01:41.920> motion<00:01:46.110> additionally

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
the direction of motion additionally

00:01:47.460 --> 00:02:00.830 
the direction of motion additionally
there's<00:01:48.460> a<00:01:48.820> worm<00:01:49.390> gear<00:01:49.720> a<00:01:54.030> knob<00:01:55.030> wheel<00:01:55.330> a

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.609 

pulley<00:02:01.840> wheel<00:02:03.300> which<00:02:04.300> also<00:02:04.569> functions<00:02:04.989> as<00:02:05.530> a

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
pulley wheel which also functions as a

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.210 
pulley wheel which also functions as a
wheel<00:02:06.130> if<00:02:06.429> you<00:02:06.580> put<00:02:06.819> rubber<00:02:08.069> around<00:02:09.069> the

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
wheel if you put rubber around the

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:17.220 
wheel if you put rubber around the
outside<00:02:09.610> edge<00:02:09.789> and<00:02:11.550> a<00:02:12.550> small<00:02:14.010> turntable<00:02:15.010> gear
