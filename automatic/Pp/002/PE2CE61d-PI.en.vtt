messing<00:04:48.540> up<00:04:48.930> with<00:04:49.200> the<00:04:49.590> world<00:04:50.280> generators<00:04:50.880> or

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
messing up with the world generators or

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.940 
messing up with the world generators or
something<00:04:52.130> because<00:04:54.170> he<00:04:55.170> added<00:04:55.560> two<00:04:55.770> new

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
something because he added two new

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.900 
something because he added two new

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
volcanoes so I don't think that could

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.120 
volcanoes so I don't think that could
fail<00:05:05.360> no<00:05:06.360> but<00:05:06.720> I<00:05:06.900> mean<00:05:07.080> see<00:05:07.470> then<00:05:07.650> look<00:05:07.920> at<00:05:08.010> this

maybe maybe he's kind of differing the
world<00:05:26.010> spawn<00:05:26.370> a<00:05:26.400> bit<00:05:26.670> maybe<00:05:27.270> like<00:05:28.110> there's

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
world spawn a bit maybe like there's

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.060 
world spawn a bit maybe like there's
sort<00:05:28.920> of<00:05:29.010> your<00:05:29.240> archipelagos<00:05:30.410> you<00:05:31.410> know<00:05:31.530> yeah

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
sort of your archipelagos you know yeah

think<00:06:18.060> it<00:06:18.150> would<00:06:18.210> be<00:06:18.360> maple<00:06:19.880> it<00:06:20.880> could<00:06:21.150> think

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:21.330 
think it would be maple it could think

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.330 
think it would be maple it could think
maple<00:06:22.050> or<00:06:22.200> oak<00:06:22.380> maybe<00:06:22.950> weeks

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:23.340 
maple or oak maybe weeks

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.730 
maple or oak maybe weeks
oh<00:06:23.490> no<00:06:23.850> no<00:06:24.150> oak<00:06:24.390> has<00:06:24.600> already<00:06:24.930> made<00:06:25.080> its<00:06:25.350> it's

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:25.740 
oh no no oak has already made its it's

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.670 
oh no no oak has already made its it's
the<00:06:25.860> default<00:06:26.040> tree<00:06:26.580> oh<00:06:26.820> I<00:06:27.780> think<00:06:28.230> it<00:06:28.470> actually

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.680 
the default tree oh I think it actually

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.750 
the default tree oh I think it actually
maple<00:06:29.280> try<00:06:29.760> hitting<00:06:30.060> one<00:06:30.240> trying<00:06:30.750> to<00:06:30.840> get<00:06:30.990> some

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:31.760 
maple try hitting one trying to get some

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:35.590 
maple try hitting one trying to get some
maple<00:06:32.540> syrup<00:06:33.880> well<00:06:34.880> I'm<00:06:35.000> gonna<00:06:35.120> end<00:06:35.360> the<00:06:35.480> video
