00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.970
 mentally in this new video that 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.490
 by now it is customary for Friday mornings 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.769

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.460

 is in the avant-garde room e 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.600
 in many they have the hope that comes from 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.340
 gallaro after last week 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.730

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.010
 the beauty of 1.4 million players 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.599
 they bought icebreaker week 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.760
 last at the icebreaker these are given 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.140
 taken directly to the right but not me 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.360

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.489
 guys I'm sorry for you but it's not there 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.410
 not even the shadow of the alan horn indeed 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.510
 there is the exotic weapon I think more useless than the 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:47.010
 game but we go by degrees 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:50.280
 then mqm 4 44 fairies armor 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.610
 leg for the titan class that has like 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.559
 why more transportable ammunition x lam 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.899
 and heavy it was fired loaded that lasts 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.420
 longer then dance machine 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.270
 radiant also here leg armor for 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.220
 the hunter who has as if more 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.799
 ammunition transportable presidents and 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.080
 It moves more and faster lenses 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:12.150
 when I'm re side when aiming 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.830
 weapon is Italian scholastic with rulers 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.710
 translator thymus and faster when 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.500
 I reveal myself as a focault protocol 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.509
 stellar for the sorcerer for i 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.979
 warlock which as for as further 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.229
 grenade fusion plus ammunition 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.509
 transportable for the fusion forge and 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.650
 more transportable ammunition for weapons 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.970
 heavy 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.710
 I already have it so I wo n't buy 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.640
 besides the nothing exotic weapon 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.710
 you will say dangerously lousy 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.060
 dangerously because maybe some of 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.159
 you buy it without realizing 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.840
 that make the purchase really lousy 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.270
 don't buy it guys also because with 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.369
 St 17 strange you want this weapon does 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.570
 defecate however we see that to years of 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.159
 precision increased the killings 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.020
 the damage increases for a short time 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.579
 inflicted on the next blow and this 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.930
 Exotic precision rifle can be 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.420
 equipped in the weapon slot 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.890
 primary ok useless then we have a 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.750
 exotic fragment 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.659
 rather a fragment of hunger understood tc 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:07.619
 purchased for himself among the coins elia 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:09.810
 exotic ingram for the head for the helmet 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.640
 I personally bought one 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.410
 grammar a telemetry of which vi 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.210
 I'll talk more below then for how much 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.610
 about armament upgrades 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:21.060
 exotic we have in the radar zuccone for the 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.130
 hunter the cleofa symbiont go for the 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.350
 hunter always helmet of the shining but 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.450
 for the titan wolf tip alpha for the 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.640
 titano light over the months for it 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.560
 sorcerer and he just breaks them for how long 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.620

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.990
 of the thunder of alan horn and truth 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.180
 so if you have any of these objects 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.190

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.990
 pure light attack 36 regarding 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.880
 I recommend the equipment 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:51.030
 do it as soon as possible for the cost of 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.190
 about 7 thousand coins each then in the 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.050

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:23.250
 nothing curious but grand exotic 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.680
