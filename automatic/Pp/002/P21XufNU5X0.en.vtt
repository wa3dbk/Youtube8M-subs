00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.780
 I will explain that the result of this personal investigation and yes 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:11.569
 about why these products function 

00:00:11.569 --> 00:00:12.969
 very simple 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:16.119
 elle where you are seeing there are people that maybe 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.220
 This program is going to see different parts of Latin America in different 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.570
 different countries places 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.939
 Anyone 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.919
 china colombia costa rica panama uruguay mexico united states even though 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:29.759
 will create and very worthy all human beings 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:30.640
 We are made 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.599
 of exact 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:34.350
 mind the same substances 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.880
 the same atoms the same cells 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.470
 in this gives the reason 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.649
 Within this head there are many differences 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.530
 the brain you have ideas thoughts theories 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.620
 but we're not going to talk about that 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.180
 any human being 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.920
 from anywhere in the world 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.460
 You can use this product 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.760
 because simply and simply is the same as you 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.920
 The human body is composed of five systems 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.630
 when I talk about five systems 12 that these basic information I know that 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:01.139
 this is 

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:03.139
 for public one primary 

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:05.850
 but many of us did not pay attention to this information if 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.170
 we would have paid attention to these biology classes in elementary school 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.680
 we would understand this simple theory 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.550
 but deeper than you think 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.310
 The human body is composed of five systems 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.420
 the first system 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.460
 the circulatory system today to omar and what is the circulatory system for? 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.140
 I am no medical authority 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.610
 but these common knowledge 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.289
 circulatory system the only thing that makes 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:33.840
 is that all your old leads in the blood to all the organs of your body 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.470
 the muscles and so on 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:36.899
 it's simple and simple 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:37.939
 and what happens 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:40.939
 If I have a weakened circulatory system 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.499
 which means that your heart is going to try harder when you try harder 

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:47.120
 will have to work double 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.380
 it means that your heart has a life time 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.320
 from 40 to 50 70 80 100 years 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.070
 and you make it work double you can contribute your life time that simple 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.079
 as simple as that 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:01:59.790
 ohio sea 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.490
 and what happens to my respiratory system 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.760
 he is weak because what is going to happen that you are going to catch cold very easy that you are going to 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.599
 have diseases that have to do with the respiratory system 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:11.420
 today to omar 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.920
 with my digestive system by rock to go to the bathroom or ultra problems 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.079
 to digest food 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:18.930
 stomach upsets 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.930
 all that guy proposes more physicists 

00:02:22.749 --> 00:02:24.709
 these products do not 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:25.579
 cured 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:28.989
 It is very important that you understand this concept 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:30.490
 the products do not cure 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.310

 commonly called as antibodies 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.709
 to defend attack 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.930

 it is proven that it works and if together 

00:03:42.779 --> 00:03:46.719
 a proven economic model what works?

 and what does it work that works and what 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:00.740
 More than 40 million customers in 70 countries think about this data 40 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:01.999
 millions of customers
