bounces and that's the whole point what
we<00:00:36.560> do<00:00:36.829> is<00:00:37.160> we<00:00:37.730> replace<00:00:38.180> the<00:00:38.960> thermoset<00:00:39.739> resins

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
we do is we replace the thermoset resins

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.729 
we do is we replace the thermoset resins
and<00:00:40.460> composites<00:00:41.060> like<00:00:41.239> epoxy<00:00:41.600> zand<00:00:42.200> polyester

take<00:00:47.000> the<00:00:47.210> composite<00:00:47.899> that's<00:00:48.079> very

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
take the composite that's very

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.100 
take the composite that's very
lightweight<00:00:48.530> and<00:00:49.040> strong<00:00:49.310> and<00:00:49.700> we<00:00:50.570> increase

making through balance composite are

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.149 
making through balance composite are
just<00:01:55.640> so<00:01:55.820> durable<00:01:56.560> repairing<00:01:57.560> surfboards<00:01:58.040> is

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
just so durable repairing surfboards is

a lot of the environmental issues as to

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.960 
a lot of the environmental issues as to
why<00:03:13.140> this<00:03:14.040> industry<00:03:14.550> has<00:03:14.580> been<00:03:14.730> shipped

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
why this industry has been shipped

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.449 
why this industry has been shipped
overseas<00:03:15.230> me<00:03:16.230> we<00:03:16.380> can<00:03:16.530> deliver<00:03:16.830> a<00:03:16.920> competitive

overseas me we can deliver a competitive
product<00:03:17.880> built<00:03:18.330> here<00:03:18.810> and<00:03:19.220> make<00:03:20.220> customers

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
product built here and make customers

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.300 
product built here and make customers
more<00:03:21.120> excited<00:03:21.720> about<00:03:21.870> that<00:03:22.260> product<00:03:22.530> than

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
more excited about that product than

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.860 
more excited about that product than
they<00:03:23.550> are<00:03:23.700> from<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.120> average<00:03:24.360> product<00:03:24.720> coming

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
they are from the average product coming

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.790 
they are from the average product coming
from<00:03:25.080> Asia<00:03:25.290> and<00:03:26.300> so<00:03:27.300> the<00:03:27.630> process<00:03:28.020> is<00:03:28.350> not<00:03:28.650> only

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
from Asia and so the process is not only

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.440 
from Asia and so the process is not only
environmentally<00:03:29.280> conscious<00:03:29.940> but<00:03:30.120> it's<00:03:30.300> also

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
environmentally conscious but it's also

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.360 
environmentally conscious but it's also
great<00:03:30.690> for<00:03:30.780> our<00:03:31.020> workers<00:03:31.230> it's<00:03:31.709> a<00:03:31.830> very<00:03:32.040> safe

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
great for our workers it's a very safe

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.250 
great for our workers it's a very safe
environment<00:03:33.000> so<00:03:33.840> we're<00:03:33.990> really<00:03:34.140> excited

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
environment so we're really excited

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.880 
environment so we're really excited
about<00:03:34.800> how<00:03:35.370> those<00:03:35.580> things<00:03:35.640> work<00:03:36.000> together<00:03:36.330> and

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
about how those things work together and

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.230 
about how those things work together and
delivering<00:03:37.890> that<00:03:38.010> bounce<00:03:38.280> technology<00:03:38.970> board

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:39.240 
delivering that bounce technology board

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.870 
delivering that bounce technology board
to<00:03:39.480> the<00:03:39.570> customer<00:03:40.050> at<00:03:40.140> the<00:03:40.230> right<00:03:40.380> price<00:03:40.880> these

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
to the customer at the right price these

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.699 
to the customer at the right price these
products<00:03:42.300> are<00:03:42.450> made<00:03:42.690> in<00:03:42.870> America<00:03:43.320> they're<00:03:43.590> not

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
products are made in America they're not

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.949 
products are made in America they're not
out<00:03:43.920> sourced<00:03:44.280> at<00:03:44.430> all<00:03:44.550> that's<00:03:45.180> one<00:03:45.450> reason<00:03:45.600> to

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
out sourced at all that's one reason to

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.479 
out sourced at all that's one reason to
invest<00:03:46.290> in<00:03:46.440> it<00:03:46.560> and<00:03:46.709> another<00:03:46.860> is<00:03:47.070> because<00:03:47.370> they

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
invest in it and another is because they

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.520 
invest in it and another is because they
are<00:03:47.610> environmentally<00:03:48.270> friendly<00:03:48.630> and<00:03:48.840> I<00:03:49.350> just

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
are environmentally friendly and I just

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.080 
are environmentally friendly and I just
think<00:03:49.739> that<00:03:49.890> anything<00:03:50.459> that<00:03:50.489> we<00:03:50.700> can<00:03:50.880> do<00:03:51.000> to

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
think that anything that we can do to

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.600 
think that anything that we can do to
support<00:03:51.270> our<00:03:51.720> local<00:03:52.350> area<00:03:52.650> our<00:03:53.040> local<00:03:53.550> economy

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
support our local area our local economy

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.220 
support our local area our local economy
let<00:03:54.540> alone<00:03:54.660> our<00:03:54.930> US<00:03:55.470> economy<00:03:56.010> is<00:03:56.130> a<00:03:56.340> big<00:03:56.610> factor

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
let alone our US economy is a big factor

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.380 
let alone our US economy is a big factor
so<00:03:58.230> I<00:03:58.290> hope<00:03:58.440> we've<00:03:58.620> communicated<00:03:58.890> to<00:03:59.520> you<00:03:59.700> what
