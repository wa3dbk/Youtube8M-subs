really<00:01:21.050> happier<00:01:21.350> to<00:01:21.620> get<00:01:21.860> this<00:01:26.860> so<00:01:27.860> stitching

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
really happier to get this so stitching

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.140 
really happier to get this so stitching
is<00:01:28.970> really<00:01:29.630> good<00:01:29.810> on<00:01:29.960> it<00:01:29.990> so<00:01:30.880> but<00:01:31.880> if<00:01:32.000> you're

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
is really good on it so but if you're

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.280 
is really good on it so but if you're
wondering<00:01:32.420> well<00:01:32.600> how<00:01:32.630> does<00:01:32.840> this<00:01:33.080> actually

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
wondering well how does this actually

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.140 
wondering well how does this actually
compare<00:01:33.860> to<00:01:34.250> the<00:01:34.610> I<00:01:35.230> guess<00:01:36.230> to<00:01:36.440> the<00:01:36.470> real<00:01:36.770> suit

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
compare to the I guess to the real suit

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:45.130 
compare to the I guess to the real suit
I<00:01:38.150> have<00:01:39.080> one<00:01:39.260> just<00:01:39.500> here<00:01:40.900> so<00:01:43.900> all<00:01:44.900> the

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
I have one just here so all the

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.430 
I have one just here so all the
lettering<00:01:45.410> is<00:01:45.560> the<00:01:45.650> same

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
lettering is the same

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:55.750 
lettering is the same
obviously<00:01:48.440> the<00:01:50.620> because<00:01:51.620> it's<00:01:51.830> bigger<00:01:54.760> the

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:55.760 
obviously the because it's bigger the

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.040 
obviously the because it's bigger the
definition<00:01:56.360> is<00:01:56.510> obviously<00:01:57.440> a<00:01:57.800> lot<00:01:58.280> better<00:01:59.050> but

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
definition is obviously a lot better but

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:07.900 
definition is obviously a lot better but
I<00:02:00.350> think<00:02:01.690> as<00:02:02.690> a<00:02:02.720> whole<00:02:06.280> you<00:02:07.280> can<00:02:07.490> tell<00:02:07.700> it's

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
I think as a whole you can tell it's

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:21.010 
I think as a whole you can tell it's
pretty<00:02:08.290> damn<00:02:09.290> close<00:02:09.710> to<00:02:09.770> it<00:02:10.070> so<00:02:12.040> yeah<00:02:19.450> and<00:02:20.450> the

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
pretty damn close to it so yeah and the

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.750 
pretty damn close to it so yeah and the
zip<00:02:21.230> is<00:02:21.350> really<00:02:21.620> good<00:02:21.830> and<00:02:22.130> I<00:02:22.250> like<00:02:22.460> how<00:02:22.610> the<00:02:22.670> a

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
zip is really good and I like how the a

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.820 
zip is really good and I like how the a
comes<00:02:23.239> over<00:02:23.600> it<00:02:23.720> as<00:02:23.840> well<00:02:23.870> so<00:02:24.080> it's<00:02:24.470> all<00:02:24.560> nicely

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
comes over it as well so it's all nicely

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.370 
comes over it as well so it's all nicely
covered<00:02:25.220> so<00:02:26.180> which<00:02:26.510> is<00:02:26.720> exactly<00:02:27.320> what<00:02:27.650> the

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
covered so which is exactly what the

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:36.820 
covered so which is exactly what the
other<00:02:30.380> jacket<00:02:30.680> does<00:02:31.010> so<00:02:32.530> and<00:02:35.380> the<00:02:36.380> patterning

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
other jacket does so and the patterning

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:43.449 
other jacket does so and the patterning
is<00:02:36.920> pretty<00:02:37.130> close<00:02:37.400> as<00:02:37.640> well<00:02:40.390> yeah<00:02:41.390> so<00:02:42.340> it<00:02:43.340> would

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
is pretty close as well yeah so it would

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.270 
is pretty close as well yeah so it would
be<00:02:43.610> cool<00:02:43.820> if<00:02:44.090> the<00:02:45.050> texture<00:02:45.440> was<00:02:45.680> similar<00:02:46.070> I

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
be cool if the texture was similar I

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.490 
be cool if the texture was similar I
mean<00:02:46.370> the<00:02:46.850> the<00:02:47.120> texture<00:02:47.480> on<00:02:47.600> the<00:02:47.780> actual<00:02:48.320> race

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
mean the the texture on the actual race

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.960 
mean the the texture on the actual race
jacket<00:02:48.950> is<00:02:49.070> a<00:02:49.340> little<00:02:50.150> bit<00:02:51.250> similar<00:02:52.250> to<00:02:52.340> I

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
jacket is a little bit similar to I

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.610 
jacket is a little bit similar to I
would<00:02:53.690> say<00:02:53.900> hawkeye<00:02:56.050> maybe<00:02:57.050> the<00:02:57.170> texture<00:02:57.590> on

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
would say hawkeye maybe the texture on

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.120 
would say hawkeye maybe the texture on
Hawkeye's<00:02:58.100> pants<00:02:58.610> I<00:02:58.730> guess<00:02:59.440> with<00:03:00.440> little<00:03:00.950> bits

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
Hawkeye's pants I guess with little bits

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.820
