Firefly fuzz today it's our tribute to a

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.630 
Firefly fuzz today it's our tribute to a
classic<00:00:23.779> three<00:00:24.020> germanium<00:00:24.740> transistor<00:00:25.340> fuzz

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
classic three germanium transistor fuzz

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:44.250 
classic three germanium transistor fuzz
from<00:00:25.970> the<00:00:26.090> 60s

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.600 

taking<00:00:45.260> a<00:00:45.320> look<00:00:45.410> at<00:00:45.560> the<00:00:45.680> controls<00:00:46.070> we<00:00:46.460> have<00:00:46.490> a

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
taking a look at the controls we have a

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.580 
taking a look at the controls we have a
standard<00:00:47.150> volume<00:00:47.360> control<00:00:47.900> allows<00:00:48.320> you<00:00:48.470> to

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
standard volume control allows you to

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.580 
standard volume control allows you to
cut<00:00:48.980> our<00:00:49.160> boost<00:00:49.400> signal<00:00:49.790> EQ<00:00:50.750> control<00:00:51.170> that

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 
cut our boost signal EQ control that

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.040 
cut our boost signal EQ control that
could<00:00:51.710> be<00:00:51.890> also<00:00:52.250> called<00:00:52.640> a<00:00:52.790> tone<00:00:53.000> control<00:00:53.050> the

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
could be also called a tone control the

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.810 
could be also called a tone control the
fuzz<00:00:54.290> control<00:00:54.710> allows<00:00:54.980> you<00:00:55.160> to<00:00:55.310> adjust<00:00:55.670> the

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
fuzz control allows you to adjust the

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.520 
fuzz control allows you to adjust the
amount<00:00:55.940> of<00:00:56.120> distortion<00:00:56.720> or<00:00:56.810> fuzz<00:00:57.080> within<00:00:57.410> the

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
amount of distortion or fuzz within the

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.190 
amount of distortion or fuzz within the
circuit<00:00:57.860> and<00:00:58.070> the<00:00:58.520> bias<00:00:58.730> control<00:00:59.240> device

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:00.200 
circuit and the bias control device

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.200 
circuit and the bias control device
control<00:01:00.650> is<00:01:00.770> unique<00:01:01.100> in<00:01:01.280> the<00:01:01.370> fact<00:01:01.400> that<00:01:01.730> it

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
control is unique in the fact that it

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.910 
control is unique in the fact that it
adjusts<00:01:02.720> voltage<00:01:03.140> to<00:01:03.350> a<00:01:03.380> particular

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
adjusts voltage to a particular

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.830 
adjusts voltage to a particular
transistor<00:01:04.520> and<00:01:04.699> the<00:01:05.210> reason<00:01:05.510> for<00:01:05.660> this<00:01:05.780> is

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
transistor and the reason for this is

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.750 
transistor and the reason for this is
when<00:01:06.410> these<00:01:06.620> fuzzes<00:01:07.070> were<00:01:07.220> originally

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
when these fuzzes were originally

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.330 
when these fuzzes were originally
designed<00:01:08.240> in<00:01:08.660> the<00:01:08.780> 60s<00:01:09.230> they<00:01:09.560> used<00:01:09.770> germanium

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
designed in the 60s they used germanium

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.730 
designed in the 60s they used germanium
devices<00:01:10.820> just<00:01:11.000> like<00:01:11.210> this<00:01:11.420> but<00:01:12.230> different

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
devices just like this but different

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.170 
devices just like this but different
temperatures<00:01:13.160> would<00:01:13.370> change<00:01:13.580> the<00:01:13.760> sound<00:01:14.030> of

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
temperatures would change the sound of

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.610 
temperatures would change the sound of
your<00:01:14.300> pedal<00:01:14.600> that's<00:01:14.810> how<00:01:14.930> sensitive<00:01:15.380> those

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:15.620 
your pedal that's how sensitive those

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.250 
your pedal that's how sensitive those
devices<00:01:15.950> are<00:01:16.250> there's<00:01:17.119> stories<00:01:17.540> of<00:01:17.810> session

bypass signal let's take a listen to the
pedal

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.670 

okay<00:01:56.560> let's<00:01:57.560> do<00:01:57.680> a<00:01:57.710> lower<00:01:58.010> gain<00:01:58.250> setting

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
okay let's do a lower gain setting

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:14.620 
okay let's do a lower gain setting
brighten<00:02:00.680> it<00:02:00.740> up<00:02:00.860> a<00:02:00.920> little

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
go to the neck pick up and roll the tone

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:30.440 
go to the neck pick up and roll the tone
control<00:02:17.459> back
