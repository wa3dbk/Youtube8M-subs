like the character red hood and I like
the<00:00:29.340> idea<00:00:29.460> of<00:00:29.760> a<00:00:30.210> former<00:00:30.720> good<00:00:31.349> guy<00:00:31.529> who

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
the idea of a former good guy who

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.790 
the idea of a former good guy who
basically<00:00:32.820> becomes<00:00:33.329> an<00:00:33.420> antihero<00:00:33.899> /<00:00:34.320> villain

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
basically becomes an antihero / villain

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.610 
basically becomes an antihero / villain
and<00:00:35.360> just<00:00:36.360> looking<00:00:36.660> at<00:00:36.780> this<00:00:36.870> game<00:00:37.079> Red<00:00:37.440> Hood

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
and just looking at this game Red Hood

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.090 
and just looking at this game Red Hood
would<00:00:37.829> fit<00:00:38.040> in<00:00:38.160> perfectly<00:00:38.190> I<00:00:39.090> mean<00:00:39.710> if<00:00:40.710> they

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
would fit in perfectly I mean if they

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.709 
would fit in perfectly I mean if they
didn't<00:00:41.340> have<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.489> man<00:00:41.760> I<00:00:42.000> think<00:00:42.180> that'd<00:00:42.570> be<00:00:42.690> a

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
didn't have a man I think that'd be a

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.959 
didn't have a man I think that'd be a
mistake<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.440> I<00:00:43.980> really<00:00:44.309> I<00:00:44.460> think<00:00:44.489> he's<00:00:44.789> being

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
mistake and I really I think he's being

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.510 
mistake and I really I think he's being
from<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.300> start<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:45.809> if<00:00:46.410> he<00:00:46.800> isn't<00:00:46.950> I<00:00:47.219> guess

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
from the start and if he isn't I guess

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.690 
from the start and if he isn't I guess
then<00:00:47.789> just<00:00:48.059> please<00:00:48.660> DLC<00:00:49.260> I<00:00:49.440> don't<00:00:49.920> know<00:00:50.010> I<00:00:50.219> just

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
then just please DLC I don't know I just

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.240 
then just please DLC I don't know I just
think<00:00:51.090> red<00:00:51.660> hood<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:52.170> just<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.680> perfect<00:00:52.890> fit

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
think red hood is just the perfect fit

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.069 
think red hood is just the perfect fit
for<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.489> tone<00:00:53.730> they're<00:00:54.059> setting<00:00:54.420> for<00:00:54.989> the

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
for the tone they're setting for the

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.900 
for the tone they're setting for the
mood<00:00:55.320> I<00:00:55.649> know<00:00:55.739> that's<00:00:56.219> pretty<00:00:56.460> much<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.670> same

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
mood I know that's pretty much the same

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.660 
mood I know that's pretty much the same
thing<00:00:56.969> still<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:58.500> I'm<00:00:58.829> most<00:00:59.100> curious<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.550> see

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
thing still and I'm most curious to see

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.029 
thing still and I'm most curious to see
what<00:00:59.820> they<00:00:59.910> would<00:01:00.030> do<00:01:00.180> with<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.420> design<00:01:01.039> being

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
what they would do with the design being

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.219 
what they would do with the design being
that<00:01:02.460> more<00:01:03.000> of<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.149> nether<00:01:03.480> realm<00:01:03.690> team<00:01:03.960> has

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
that more of the nether realm team has

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.600 
that more of the nether realm team has
been<00:01:04.379> given<00:01:04.680> full<00:01:04.920> range<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.280> do<00:01:05.369> what<00:01:05.489> they

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
been given full range to do what they

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.520

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
want with the costumes they have varied

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.929 
want with the costumes they have varied
too<00:01:07.710> much<00:01:07.950> from<00:01:08.159> what<00:01:08.250> they<00:01:08.400> look<00:01:08.580> like<00:01:08.610> but

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
too much from what they look like but

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.429 
too much from what they look like but
they<00:01:09.000> have<00:01:09.150> given<00:01:09.330> them<00:01:09.540> their<00:01:09.659> own<00:01:09.720> feel<00:01:10.200> like

they have given them their own feel like
I<00:01:10.590> can<00:01:10.830> definitely<00:01:10.950> tell<00:01:11.250> by<00:01:11.369> looking<00:01:11.580> at<00:01:11.610> the

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
I can definitely tell by looking at the

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.670 
I can definitely tell by looking at the
characters<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.299> nether<00:01:13.049> realm<00:01:13.290> designed

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
characters that nether realm designed

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.359 
characters that nether realm designed
them<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:14.520> if<00:01:14.820> Red<00:01:15.299> Hood<00:01:15.540> was<00:01:15.869> put<00:01:16.110> in<00:01:16.259> he<00:01:17.189> would

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
them so if Red Hood was put in he would

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.520 
them so if Red Hood was put in he would
just<00:01:17.520> I<00:01:17.900> can't<00:01:18.900> even<00:01:18.990> imagine<00:01:19.140> what<00:01:19.439> the

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
just I can't even imagine what the

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.230 
just I can't even imagine what the
design<00:01:19.830> would<00:01:19.979> look<00:01:20.189> like<00:01:20.340> I<00:01:20.549> mean<00:01:20.820> I'm<00:01:21.150> just

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
design would look like I mean I'm just

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.050 
design would look like I mean I'm just
I'd<00:01:21.990> love<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.560> see<00:01:22.770> what<00:01:22.890> they<00:01:22.950> got<00:01:23.070> but<00:01:23.909> what

characters<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.430> I<00:01:39.090> understand<00:01:39.450> what<00:01:39.540> the

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
characters and I understand what the

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.109 
characters and I understand what the
argument<00:01:39.780> is<00:01:40.110> is<00:01:40.380> that<00:01:40.590> there<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.759> doesn't

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
argument is is that there it doesn't

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.300 
argument is is that there it doesn't
give<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.630> lot<00:01:42.810> of<00:01:42.960> chance<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.500> other<00:01:43.740> characters

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
give a lot of chance to other characters

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.170 
give a lot of chance to other characters
but<00:01:44.430> we<00:01:44.520> got<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.729> understand<00:01:45.060> they're

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
but we got to understand they're

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.480 
but we got to understand they're
probably<00:01:45.420> trying<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.960> get<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.380> lot<00:01:47.130> of<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.310> big

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
probably trying to get a lot of the big

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.100 
probably trying to get a lot of the big
names<00:01:47.520> if<00:01:48.000> you<00:01:48.090> didn't<00:01:48.360> put<00:01:48.509> them<00:01:48.600> in<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.780> DC

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
names if you didn't put them in a DC

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.230 
names if you didn't put them in a DC
game<00:01:49.350> people<00:01:49.770> would<00:01:49.890> be<00:01:50.009> upset<00:01:50.130> um<00:01:51.560> and<00:01:53.240> I

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
game people would be upset um and I

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.080 
game people would be upset um and I
guess<00:01:55.079> if<00:01:55.350> they<00:01:55.619> put<00:01:55.860> in<00:01:55.979> red<00:01:56.310> hood<00:01:56.610> I<00:01:56.880> don't

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
guess if they put in red hood I don't

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.310 
guess if they put in red hood I don't
know<00:01:57.240> if<00:01:57.329> too<00:01:57.570> many<00:01:57.719> people<00:01:57.840> would<00:01:58.140> complain

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320
