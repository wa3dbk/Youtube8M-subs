00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
back I did it but it was really sloppy I

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.830 
back I did it but it was really sloppy I
actually<00:01:05.850> have<00:01:06.090> some<00:01:06.240> footage<00:01:06.420> of<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.630> check

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
actually have some footage of a check

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.320 
actually have some footage of a check
did<00:01:10.220> ya<00:01:11.220> see<00:01:11.490> I'm<00:01:11.880> pretty<00:01:12.119> sure<00:01:12.299> a

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
did ya see I'm pretty sure a

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.789 
did ya see I'm pretty sure a
seven-year-old<00:01:13.170> somewhere<00:01:13.409> has<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.530> cleaner

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
seven-year-old somewhere has a cleaner

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.800 
seven-year-old somewhere has a cleaner
room<00:01:14.040> then<00:01:14.220> that<00:01:14.340> trick<00:01:14.580> was<00:01:14.729> clean<00:01:15.000> if<00:01:15.600> that

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
room then that trick was clean if that

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.149 
room then that trick was clean if that
makes<00:01:15.990> sense<00:01:16.140> but<00:01:16.500> i<00:01:16.560> do<00:01:16.680> want<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:16.920> hit<00:01:17.040> this

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
makes sense but i do want to hit this

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.530
