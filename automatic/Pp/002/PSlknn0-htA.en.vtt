 brick sheets 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.309
 it comes in the preparation of 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.440
 many speakers like the pastilla the 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:15.490

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.619
 Moroccan cuisine 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.989
 we will see it is a method very 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:22.179
 simple that remains within the reach of all and 

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:24.220
 which gives very flexible leaves so 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:25.810
 easy to use and conscious 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.869
 once cooked I let you discover 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:31.239
 preparing to start I'm going

 attack the dough to have a 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:36.040
 Twenty barrels of real that small 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.680

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.960
 mixing with the help of the crazy and 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.620
 energetically to be sure that there is no 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.620
 no lumps 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.450
 I cover my paw and leave it 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:41.860
 rest 10 minutes 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.750
 prepare a water bath by putting the water 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.689

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.360
 deep on the fire put a pan 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:51.250
 nonstick over and once the 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.289
 stove and hot enough so quickly 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.060
 as wide as possible both times 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:57.700
 to avoid having a leaf too 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.970
 fine that will be difficult to manipulate by 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.020
 following the cooking of the sheet takes 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.360
 a few seconds 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.940
 discovering the edges that starts to 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.880
 Known and come off the stove 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.160
 gently remove and try again 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.400
 the operation until exhaustion of the 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.049
 paste to keep our sheet of 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.480
 brick built young she has slightly 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:44.799
 of oil and cover it with a clean cloth 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:47.739
 and avoid that a dry and since 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:49.359
 this is extremely fine facts placed 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:50.109
 between each sheet of paper 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:53.310
 alimentary 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:55.750
 in this way it remains intact 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.150
 when all the leaves are done 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.090
 and separated from an apoca food paper 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.230
 not glued to each other 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.280
 discover a fine paper and the 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.280
 wrapped in a towel 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:25.379
 we know is closed at least at the bottom 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:27.780
 refrigerator between 0 and 4 degrees 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:30.629
 they must be soft to the touch and 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.639
 should be handled easily if she 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:35.219
 breaks on the edge is that they do not 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:37.560
 are more fresh enough to arrange them 

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:39.590
 on a clean unified towel they 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.329
 find their flexibility 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.169
 so here is the final presentation of my 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:46.500
 brick sheets 

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:48.510
