here<00:00:03.330> and<00:00:03.750> this<00:00:04.380> is<00:00:04.589> my<00:00:04.890> review<00:00:05.310> of<00:00:05.490> the<00:00:05.580> Strix

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
here and this is my review of the Strix

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.759 
here and this is my review of the Strix
r9<00:00:06.990> 380<00:00:07.440> from<00:00:08.250> a<00:00:08.460> soos<00:00:08.760> so<00:00:09.360> the<00:00:09.510> r9<00:00:09.690> 380<00:00:10.200> is

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
r9 380 from a soos so the r9 380 is
