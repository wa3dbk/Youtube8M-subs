00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.100
 malagon 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:12.700

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:12.700
 departure in the province of ciudad real 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.680
 here Romans and Carthaginians fought a 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.360
 great battle in the 3rd century before 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.070
 Christ and have been found until 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.919
 vestiges of the paleolithic or that 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:27.300

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:30.269
 let's visit its monuments more 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.099

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.110
 neither the gaps in the 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.110

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:56.320
 today we go through the origins of malagon 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:59.290
 we got to the old salar and what 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.570
 let's make the hand of Alvaro Arias 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.550
 the name of ethane origin that I had 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.550
 malagón we are at the edge of the 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.380
 bañuelos river to the skin of the Sierra de 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.180
 malagón where the town originates 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.440
 the first settlers of malagón were 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.390
 located on top of the mountain in 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.830
 looking for a very important element to 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.290
 its cultural development krea the metals 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.810
 over the centuries already with 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.640
 animation the roman conquest malagón se 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.810
 installed on the front of the saw and 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.810
 denominates the kuriles 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.420
 we find the spirit in the village 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:36.039
 saint is an ideal place to know the 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.460
 origin of the malagón pattern and it seems 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:41.049
 that go back to year 711 here there was a 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.850
 Visigoth settlement we are on top of 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:44.470
 a necropolis and before the imminent 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.899
 Muslim invasion the Visigoths that 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.970
 here they lived buried the light that I 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:51.869
 they venerated right at the place where 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.869
 marked this cross 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.399
 in the 16th century by chance it appears 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.289
 and it is decided to erect a sanctuary for 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.750
 determine the exact place of this place 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:07.140
 a sling is caught, a stone was thrown and 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.940
 put here are the 283 meters for the 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.470
 that the stone passed and here it 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.700
 he built a sanctuary santísimo sant 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.700
 the holy spirit that we give birth 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:25.610
 Rose you are taking care of all the details 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.520
 yes trying to keep it clean a 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.610
 little bit ordered within my measurements 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:34.040
 This image is very venerated in Malagon 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.990
 but it is not the original 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.060
 what was formerly burned 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.860
 during the war in the premises that there is in 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.290
 the entrance then they brought this 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.540
 carved in wood 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:47.739
 the altarpiece as you see is of baroque type 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:50.430

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:10.680
 celestial three bodies an imagery 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.439
 very profuse 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.980
 very typical of the Baroque final period 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:15.980
 even 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.760
 and they have said in malagón that the saint comes out 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.130
 every 100 years 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.470
 this is what we normally get in the 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.360
 day 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.920
 that the holy festival is celebrated 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.710

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:41.110
 cell that has always been reserved for 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:45.310
 she since the foundation was produced 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:47.849
 that image is surrounded by an aura 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:50.490
 the night that 

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:52.879
 it's very miraculous that it seems that we 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.879
 look 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.780
 from malagón we can not leave without visiting 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.030
 this little chapel because because here 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.070
 there is the stone of the saint where the 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:07.570
 tradition that sat her to 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.570
 direct the works of the convent 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.419
 In the old case of Aragón I'm going to 

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:20.160
 show a house of the oldest that 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:22.560
 there is in the locality that hides a 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.819
 story 800 of the least known of 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.819
 local history let's see 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.330
 we go good morning 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:38.540
 we can pass these things from home without 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.540
 place to doubt ahead 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.800
 I 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:57.770
 preserve temperature differences 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:06:00.319
 from outside the patio here inside the 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:03.800
 cave and alvaro this cave has a 

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:05.990
 history because if this cave is based 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:08.629
 in a legend that there were tunnels 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:10.400
 that communicated the castle with the square 

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:12.409
 of the Moors who served as a way of 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.389
 escape in possible already serious and this one 

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:16.430
 cave is located the old town 

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:18.440
 Aragon can give credibility to 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:19.970
 this story when we started 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.849
 worry people a little bit of 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:24.399
 know 

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:27.069
 in this house without a doubt in the most 

00:06:24.399 --> 00:06:28.740
 old malagón and you teach it 

00:06:27.069 --> 00:06:31.259
 the signs of the world what it says 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:32.910
 because I'm not going to access it, they tell me and 

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:37.520
 I I'm taking a while I come to 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:37.520
 here and show the whole house to whoever wants 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:53.160
 and before we leave Malagón we have to 

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:56.729
 taste their famous david cheeses that 

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:58.110

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:01.830
