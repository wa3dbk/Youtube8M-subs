so<00:00:03.360> lots<00:00:03.600> of<00:00:03.750> different<00:00:03.810> types<00:00:04.230> of<00:00:04.470> implants

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
so lots of different types of implants

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.710 
so lots of different types of implants
on<00:00:05.040> the<00:00:05.130> marketplace<00:00:05.490> today<00:00:05.970> for<00:00:06.180> patients<00:00:06.600> to

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
on the marketplace today for patients to

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.370 
on the marketplace today for patients to
decide<00:00:07.080> on<00:00:07.259> we<00:00:07.919> talked<00:00:08.429> a<00:00:08.580> little<00:00:08.730> bit<00:00:08.940> about

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:09.380 
decide on we talked a little bit about

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.440 
decide on we talked a little bit about
what<00:00:10.380> was<00:00:10.530> called<00:00:10.740> a<00:00:10.920> simpler<00:00:11.580> implant<00:00:12.030> or

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
what was called a simpler implant or

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.629 
what was called a simpler implant or
another<00:00:12.900> another<00:00:13.320> term<00:00:13.740> for<00:00:14.099> them<00:00:14.219> could<00:00:14.460> be<00:00:14.610> a

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
another another term for them could be a

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.029 
another another term for them could be a
mini<00:00:14.910> implant<00:00:15.420> where<00:00:15.630> there's<00:00:16.170> a<00:00:16.410> one-stage

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
mini implant where there's a one-stage

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.189 
mini implant where there's a one-stage
implant<00:00:17.490> and<00:00:17.760> a<00:00:18.150> two-stage<00:00:18.630> implant<00:00:19.080> a

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
implant and a two-stage implant a

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.990 
implant and a two-stage implant a
one-stage<00:00:19.770> is<00:00:20.010> where<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.250> patient<00:00:20.609> goes<00:00:20.760> in

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
one-stage is where the patient goes in

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000 
one-stage is where the patient goes in
it's<00:00:21.210> just<00:00:21.390> under<00:00:21.630> local<00:00:21.930> freezing<00:00:22.529> and<00:00:22.680> the

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
it's just under local freezing and the

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.529 
it's just under local freezing and the
implants<00:00:23.460> are<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.580> little<00:00:23.670> bit<00:00:23.850> skinnier<00:00:24.330> so

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
implants are a little bit skinnier so

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:25.700 
implants are a little bit skinnier so
therefore<00:00:24.900> they<00:00:24.990> can<00:00:25.140> just<00:00:25.350> be<00:00:25.439> put<00:00:25.680> right

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
therefore they can just be put right

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.560 
therefore they can just be put right
directly<00:00:26.400> into<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.760> right<00:00:27.269> into<00:00:27.539> the

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
directly into the right into the

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.109 
directly into the right into the
patient's<00:00:28.349> mouth<00:00:28.500> okay<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.369> it's<00:00:29.760> just<00:00:29.910> one

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
patient's mouth okay and it's just one

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.030 
patient's mouth okay and it's just one
surgery<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.840> patient<00:00:31.170> just<00:00:31.320> goes<00:00:31.529> in<00:00:31.679> local

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
surgery the patient just goes in local

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.620 
surgery the patient just goes in local
freezing<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:32.880> go<00:00:32.969> right<00:00:33.149> through<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.420> tissue

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
freezing and go right through the tissue

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.680 
freezing and go right through the tissue
and<00:00:33.930> it's<00:00:34.380> placed<00:00:34.649> okay<00:00:35.219> we<00:00:36.030> have<00:00:36.210> also<00:00:36.390> had

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
and it's placed okay we have also had

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.209 
and it's placed okay we have also had
what's<00:00:36.870> called<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.170> two-stage<00:00:37.590> implant<00:00:38.040> now<00:00:38.190> a

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
what's called a two-stage implant now a

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.190 
what's called a two-stage implant now a
two-stage<00:00:38.670> implant<00:00:39.090> is<00:00:39.329> where<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.719> implant

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
two-stage implant is where the implant

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.840 
two-stage implant is where the implant
is<00:00:40.379> placed<00:00:40.440> first<00:00:40.950> into<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.370> patient's<00:00:41.790> mouth

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
is placed first into the patient's mouth

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.520 
is placed first into the patient's mouth
and<00:00:42.239> there's<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.750> little<00:00:42.960> bit<00:00:43.050> of<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.170> healing

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
and there's a little bit of a healing

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.619 
and there's a little bit of a healing
process<00:00:43.739> if<00:00:44.520> I<00:00:44.640> kind<00:00:44.789> of<00:00:44.879> cover<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.420> little

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
process if I kind of cover the little

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.090 
process if I kind of cover the little
attachment<00:00:46.230> we<00:00:46.320> can<00:00:46.440> kind<00:00:46.649> of<00:00:46.710> see<00:00:46.920> the

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
attachment we can kind of see the

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.069 
attachment we can kind of see the
implants<00:00:47.700> in<00:00:47.789> this<00:00:48.360> model<00:00:48.780> which<00:00:48.899> would

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
implants in this model which would

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.840 
implants in this model which would
represent<00:00:49.230> if<00:00:49.770> we<00:00:49.890> could<00:00:50.039> see<00:00:50.280> into<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.670> bone

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
represent if we could see into the bone

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.490 
represent if we could see into the bone
of<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.090> patient<00:00:51.570> that's<00:00:52.020> what<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:52.289> would<00:00:52.350> look

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
of a patient that's what it would look

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.560 
of a patient that's what it would look
like<00:00:52.559> in<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.920> jaw<00:00:53.129> bone<00:00:53.370> so<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.059> implant<00:00:54.420> is

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
like in the jaw bone so the implant is

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.720 
like in the jaw bone so the implant is
placed<00:00:54.629> right<00:00:55.199> in<00:00:55.350> here<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.739> then<00:00:56.280> it<00:00:56.309> has<00:00:56.550> to

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
placed right in here and then it has to

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.119 
placed right in here and then it has to
heal<00:00:57.000> for<00:00:57.239> about<00:00:57.420> three<00:00:57.690> months<00:00:57.899> after<00:00:58.530> three

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
heal for about three months after three

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.290 
heal for about three months after three
months<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.460> healing<00:00:59.699> there'd<00:01:00.000> be<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.149> little

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
months of healing there'd be a little

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.180 
months of healing there'd be a little
silver<00:01:00.719> cap<00:01:00.960> on<00:01:01.230> top<00:01:01.379> that<00:01:01.620> we<00:01:01.739> would<00:01:01.859> remove

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
silver cap on top that we would remove

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.250 
silver cap on top that we would remove
and<00:01:02.550> then<00:01:03.000> we<00:01:03.149> can<00:01:03.329> put<00:01:03.539> on<00:01:03.660> these<00:01:03.840> are<00:01:04.019> called

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
and then we can put on these are called

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.870 
and then we can put on these are called
abutments<00:01:04.890> this<00:01:05.189> is<00:01:05.369> what's<00:01:05.549> called<00:01:05.729> a

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
abutments this is what's called a

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.250 
abutments this is what's called a
locator<00:01:06.299> abutment<00:01:06.780> probably<00:01:07.049> one<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.170> the

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
locator abutment probably one of the

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.170 
locator abutment probably one of the
most<00:01:07.409> common<00:01:07.799> implies<00:01:08.100> systems<00:01:08.610> in<00:01:08.970> the

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
most common implies systems in the

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.649 
most common implies systems in the
marketplace<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.930> lot<00:01:10.080> of<00:01:10.200> dentures<00:01:10.619> use

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
marketplace that a lot of dentures use

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:14.090 
marketplace that a lot of dentures use
locator<00:01:12.659> abutments<00:01:13.260> are<00:01:13.350> interchangeable

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
locator abutments are interchangeable

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.859 
locator abutments are interchangeable
parts<00:01:14.400> so<00:01:14.640> we<00:01:14.729> can<00:01:14.880> remove<00:01:15.180> this<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:15.720> could

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
parts so we can remove this and I could

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.170 
parts so we can remove this and I could
put<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.049> taller<00:01:16.380> one<00:01:16.500> a<00:01:16.710> smaller<00:01:17.220> one<00:01:17.490> however

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
put a taller one a smaller one however

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.149 
put a taller one a smaller one however
that<00:01:18.420> would<00:01:18.540> work<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:19.350> advantage<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:20.040> the

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
that would work the advantage to the

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.490 
that would work the advantage to the
locator<00:01:20.610> that<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:20.880> prefer<00:01:21.450> for<00:01:21.659> my<00:01:21.810> patients<00:01:22.380> is

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
locator that I prefer for my patients is

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.530 
locator that I prefer for my patients is
that<00:01:23.009> inside<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.549> denture<00:01:23.970> again<00:01:24.270> there's<00:01:24.479> a

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
that inside the denture again there's a

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.420 
that inside the denture again there's a
little<00:01:24.689> there's<00:01:24.960> little<00:01:25.290> silver<00:01:25.830> caps<00:01:26.100> or<00:01:26.400> a

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.630 
thing in there there's different colors
but<00:01:34.049> each<00:01:34.560> one<00:01:34.829> represents<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.490> different

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
but each one represents a different

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.460 
but each one represents a different
retention<00:01:36.090> so<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.869> nice<00:01:37.020> thing<00:01:37.229> for<00:01:37.259> the

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
retention so the nice thing for the

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.929 
retention so the nice thing for the
patient<00:01:37.890> is<00:01:37.950> one<00:01:38.070> that<00:01:38.220> when<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.520> implants

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
patient is one that when the implants

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.300 
patient is one that when the implants
are<00:01:39.000> anchored<00:01:39.420> down<00:01:39.600> okay<00:01:40.380> we<00:01:40.950> can<00:01:41.159> then

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
are anchored down okay we can then

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.460 
are anchored down okay we can then
justify<00:01:41.790> how<00:01:42.150> tight<00:01:42.509> we<00:01:42.540> want<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.049> denture<00:01:43.350> to

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
justify how tight we want the denture to

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.230 
justify how tight we want the denture to
fit<00:01:43.649> again<00:01:43.950> for<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.310> age<00:01:44.490> of<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.700> patient

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
fit again for the age of the patient

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.300 
fit again for the age of the patient
it's<00:01:45.450> an<00:01:45.600> elderly<00:01:45.899> patient<00:01:46.200> we<00:01:46.799> use<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.009> little

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
it's an elderly patient we use a little

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.160 
it's an elderly patient we use a little
lighter<00:01:47.460> attention<00:01:48.119> you<00:01:48.570> know<00:01:48.689> a<00:01:48.720> younger

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
lighter attention you know a younger

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.569 
lighter attention you know a younger
patient<00:01:49.320> we<00:01:49.590> might<00:01:49.770> want<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.009> lock<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.250> down<00:01:50.549> a

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
patient we might want to lock it down a

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.639 
patient we might want to lock it down a
little<00:01:50.850> bit<00:01:50.970> harder<00:01:51.270> so<00:01:51.990> this<00:01:52.170> is<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.380> lower

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
little bit harder so this is a lower

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.850 
little bit harder so this is a lower
implant<00:01:53.220> system<00:01:53.640> using<00:01:54.630> locators<00:01:55.170> for

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
implant system using locators for

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.459 
implant system using locators for
implants<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.969> advantage<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.840> this<00:01:58.079> is<00:01:58.350> that

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
implants the advantage to this is that

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.899 
implants the advantage to this is that
down<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.250> road<00:01:59.490> if<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.909> patient<00:02:00.329> comes<00:02:00.630> in

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
down the road if the patient comes in

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:02.489 
down the road if the patient comes in
they<00:02:01.060> say<00:02:01.270> hey<00:02:01.450> you<00:02:01.509> know<00:02:01.749> what<00:02:01.869> my<00:02:02.079> I've<00:02:02.439> been

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:02.499 
they say hey you know what my I've been

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:04.289 
they say hey you know what my I've been
wearing<00:02:02.890> the<00:02:03.039> denture<00:02:03.429> it's<00:02:03.579> anchored<00:02:03.999> in<00:02:04.149> I

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 
wearing the denture it's anchored in I

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:06.300 
wearing the denture it's anchored in I
like<00:02:04.539> it<00:02:04.780> but<00:02:05.109> I've<00:02:05.259> heard<00:02:05.409> about<00:02:05.530> these<00:02:05.829> fixed

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
like it but I've heard about these fixed

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.040 
like it but I've heard about these fixed
cases<00:02:06.759> something<00:02:07.090> that's<00:02:07.240> actually<00:02:07.630> screwed

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
cases something that's actually screwed

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.259 
cases something that's actually screwed
into<00:02:08.259> the<00:02:08.410> mouth<00:02:08.649> that's<00:02:08.830> not<00:02:09.069> removable<00:02:09.580> what

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.269 
into the mouth that's not removable what

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:13.920 
into the mouth that's not removable what
that<00:02:10.450> looks<00:02:10.720> like<00:02:10.840> is<00:02:11.680> just<00:02:12.010> simply<00:02:12.310> a<00:02:12.930> similar

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
that looks like is just simply a similar

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.860 
that looks like is just simply a similar
concept<00:02:14.200> we<00:02:14.980> put<00:02:15.190> four<00:02:15.459> implants<00:02:16.060> into<00:02:16.750> the

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
concept we put four implants into the

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.839 
concept we put four implants into the
patient's<00:02:17.319> residual<00:02:17.830> Ridge<00:02:18.040> okay

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
patient's residual Ridge okay

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:20.789 
patient's residual Ridge okay
the<00:02:19.180> denture<00:02:19.599> is<00:02:19.660> then<00:02:19.870> fabricated<00:02:20.560> it's<00:02:20.680> a

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:20.799 
the denture is then fabricated it's a

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:22.440 
the denture is then fabricated it's a
little<00:02:21.040> like<00:02:21.190> a<00:02:21.220> little<00:02:21.340> bridge<00:02:21.849> that's<00:02:22.180> made

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
little like a little bridge that's made

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.990 
little like a little bridge that's made
it<00:02:23.260> anchors<00:02:23.769> right<00:02:23.950> on<00:02:24.129> to<00:02:24.310> the<00:02:24.400> implants<00:02:24.819> and

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
it anchors right on to the implants and

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.580 
it anchors right on to the implants and
we<00:02:25.299> can<00:02:25.450> see<00:02:25.660> there's<00:02:25.870> little<00:02:25.930> holes<00:02:26.260> in<00:02:26.440> here

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
we can see there's little holes in here

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.220 
we can see there's little holes in here
that<00:02:26.739> the<00:02:27.310> denture<00:02:27.790> base<00:02:27.819> would<00:02:28.569> be<00:02:28.750> screwed

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
that the denture base would be screwed

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.410 
that the denture base would be screwed
right<00:02:29.290> to<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:29.799> implants<00:02:30.190> so<00:02:30.910> that's<00:02:31.090> non

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
right to the implants so that's non

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.330 
right to the implants so that's non
removable<00:02:31.780> the<00:02:32.260> patient<00:02:32.739> would<00:02:32.860> come<00:02:33.010> in<00:02:33.129> once

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
removable the patient would come in once

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.160 
removable the patient would come in once
a<00:02:33.489> year<00:02:33.730> we<00:02:34.150> would<00:02:34.269> remove<00:02:34.629> it<00:02:34.810> for<00:02:35.110> cleaning

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
a year we would remove it for cleaning

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.589 
a year we would remove it for cleaning
hygiene<00:02:36.129> and<00:02:36.250> then<00:02:36.400> back<00:02:36.760> into<00:02:37.000> the<00:02:37.120> mouth<00:02:37.360> and

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
hygiene and then back into the mouth and

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:41.970 
hygiene and then back into the mouth and
away<00:02:38.200> they<00:02:38.379> go<00:02:40.079> the<00:02:41.079> only<00:02:41.200> other<00:02:41.470> one<00:02:41.709> thing

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
away they go the only other one thing

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.569 
away they go the only other one thing
that<00:02:42.129> I'd<00:02:42.220> like<00:02:42.400> to<00:02:42.430> show<00:02:42.760> you<00:02:42.790> guys<00:02:43.120> is<00:02:43.450> this

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
that I'd like to show you guys is this

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:46.729 
that I'd like to show you guys is this
patients<00:02:45.579> have<00:02:45.700> wear<00:02:45.940> an<00:02:46.090> upper<00:02:46.420> denture

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
patients have wear an upper denture

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.819 
patients have wear an upper denture
historically<00:02:47.739> an<00:02:48.099> upper<00:02:48.940> denture<00:02:49.500> has<00:02:50.500> the

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:50.829 
historically an upper denture has the

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:53.160 
historically an upper denture has the
fall<00:02:51.160> roof<00:02:51.489> of<00:02:51.700> the<00:02:51.760> mouth<00:02:51.879> covered<00:02:52.239> the<00:02:52.959> whole

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
fall roof of the mouth covered the whole

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.259 
fall roof of the mouth covered the whole
palate<00:02:53.739> area<00:02:54.160> of<00:02:54.370> the<00:02:54.489> patient's<00:02:54.940> mouth<00:02:55.060> is

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
palate area of the patient's mouth is

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:56.849 
palate area of the patient's mouth is
covered<00:02:55.599> so<00:02:55.629> we<00:02:55.840> lose<00:02:56.019> a<00:02:56.079> lot<00:02:56.319> of<00:02:56.349> our<00:02:56.530> taste

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:56.859 
covered so we lose a lot of our taste

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:58.619 
covered so we lose a lot of our taste
and<00:02:57.250> a<00:02:57.280> lot<00:02:57.430> of<00:02:57.459> our<00:02:57.609> sensation<00:02:58.150> for<00:02:58.329> foods

00:02:58.619 --> 00:02:58.629 
and a lot of our sensation for foods

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:02.039 
and a lot of our sensation for foods
with<00:02:59.379> using<00:02:59.799> implants<00:03:00.280> on<00:03:00.640> an<00:03:01.120> upper<00:03:01.450> arch<00:03:01.690> the

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
with using implants on an upper arch the

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:05.940 
with using implants on an upper arch the
advantage<00:03:02.560> to<00:03:02.829> it<00:03:02.859> is<00:03:03.190> this<00:03:04.590> we<00:03:05.590> can<00:03:05.769> have<00:03:05.920> a

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
advantage to it is this we can have a

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.479 
advantage to it is this we can have a
patient<00:03:06.430> with<00:03:06.670> an<00:03:06.760> upper<00:03:07.060> denture<00:03:07.530> if<00:03:08.530> we<00:03:09.190> put

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
patient with an upper denture if we put

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.030 
patient with an upper denture if we put
implants<00:03:10.150> into<00:03:10.540> the<00:03:10.660> upper<00:03:11.019> Ridge<00:03:11.260> then<00:03:11.920> we

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
implants into the upper Ridge then we

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.150 
implants into the upper Ridge then we
have<00:03:12.220> four<00:03:12.489> implants<00:03:12.940> showing<00:03:13.299> here<00:03:14.160> again

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
have four implants showing here again

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.210 
have four implants showing here again
using<00:03:15.579> locator<00:03:16.030> abutments<00:03:16.690> we<00:03:17.620> have<00:03:17.829> caps

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
using locator abutments we have caps

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.330 
using locator abutments we have caps
inserted<00:03:19.180> or<00:03:19.620> attachments<00:03:20.620> inserted<00:03:21.099> into

into place the advantage to it is now we
can<00:03:27.760> remove<00:03:28.150> the<00:03:28.540> roof<00:03:28.720> of<00:03:28.900> the<00:03:28.989> mouth<00:03:29.139> for<00:03:29.200> the

have their the roof of their mouth is

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.009 
have their the roof of their mouth is
revealed<00:03:33.430> again<00:03:33.730> they<00:03:34.239> get<00:03:34.389> better<00:03:34.599> taste

better<00:03:35.380> sensation<00:03:36.069> for<00:03:36.250> the<00:03:36.340> foods<00:03:36.840> very

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
better sensation for the foods very

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.319 
better sensation for the foods very
important<00:03:38.380> for<00:03:38.500> patients<00:03:38.680> that<00:03:39.130> have<00:03:39.340> a<00:03:39.639> high

eliminate patients that struggle with

eliminate patients that struggle with
wearing<00:03:45.489> a<00:03:45.549> denture<00:03:45.760> because<00:03:46.450> they<00:03:46.540> get
