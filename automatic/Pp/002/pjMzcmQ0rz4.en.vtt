picked<00:00:13.030> up<00:00:13.180> a<00:00:13.630> folder<00:00:14.200> from<00:00:14.820> we<00:00:15.820> have<00:00:16.029> shop

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:16.330 
picked up a folder from we have shop

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.800 
picked up a folder from we have shop
while<00:00:17.290> stationary<00:00:17.770> shop<00:00:18.360> this<00:00:19.360> will<00:00:19.570> give<00:00:19.720> me

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:19.810 
while stationary shop this will give me

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.220 
while stationary shop this will give me
the<00:00:19.990> ability<00:00:20.140> to<00:00:20.380> store<00:00:20.619> see-through<00:00:21.220> and

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
the ability to store see-through and

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.620 
the ability to store see-through and
hopefully<00:00:23.230> make<00:00:23.920> the<00:00:24.130> lights<00:00:24.460> shine<00:00:25.090> and

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:25.630 
hopefully make the lights shine and

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.780 
hopefully make the lights shine and
reflect<00:00:26.050> off<00:00:26.349> it<00:00:26.590> inside<00:00:26.980> and<00:00:27.310> when<00:00:27.700> the

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:27.790 
reflect off it inside and when the

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.429 
reflect off it inside and when the
lights<00:00:27.970> are<00:00:28.119> off<00:00:28.180> it<00:00:28.599> should<00:00:28.660> still<00:00:29.140> be<00:00:29.170> a<00:00:29.260> nice

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:29.439 
lights are off it should still be a nice

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:34.080 
lights are off it should still be a nice
color<00:00:29.800> I've<00:00:30.580> also<00:00:30.789> got<00:00:31.269> some<00:00:32.400> lights<00:00:33.400> here<00:00:33.610> oh

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.090 
color I've also got some lights here oh

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:49.270 
dollar 50 or something and I've just

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.900 
dollar 50 or something and I've just
wired<00:00:49.480> up<00:00:49.719> an<00:00:49.809> LED<00:00:49.960> to<00:00:50.379> it<00:00:50.530> I<00:00:50.739> just<00:00:51.460> won<00:00:51.730> at<00:00:51.850> the

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
wired up an LED to it I just won at the

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.139 
wired up an LED to it I just won at the
moment<00:00:52.239> you<00:00:53.050> can<00:00:53.289> wire<00:00:53.640> multiple<00:00:54.640> LEDs<00:00:54.879> that

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:55.149 
moment you can wire multiple LEDs that

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:57.299 
moment you can wire multiple LEDs that
will<00:00:55.390> ask<00:00:55.600> for<00:00:55.809> hours<00:00:56.140> off<00:00:56.350> it<00:00:56.559> and<00:00:56.710> when<00:00:57.219> you

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
will ask for hours off it and when you

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:02.459 
will ask for hours off it and when you
do<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:59.050> LED<00:01:00.210> it's<00:01:01.210> polarity<00:01:01.510> conscious<00:01:02.170> if

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:02.469 
do the LED it's polarity conscious if

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:04.290 
do the LED it's polarity conscious if
you<00:01:02.829> worried<00:01:03.129> it<00:01:03.250> around<00:01:03.579> the<00:01:03.699> wrong<00:01:03.879> way<00:01:04.059> it's

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:04.300 
you worried it around the wrong way it's

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.330 
you worried it around the wrong way it's
not<00:01:04.420> going<00:01:04.570> to<00:01:04.629> work<00:01:04.780> and<00:01:05.199> you<00:01:05.320> worried<00:01:05.770> around

not going to work and you worried around

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.450 
not going to work and you worried around
the<00:01:06.430> right<00:01:06.580> way<00:01:06.729> it<00:01:06.880> will<00:01:06.910> work<00:01:07.060> and<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:09.250> want

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
the right way it will work and you want

them you want to have an individual run
to<00:01:24.849> each<00:01:25.119> every<00:01:25.450> LED<00:01:26.729> so<00:01:27.729> it's<00:01:28.509> that<00:01:28.720> this<00:01:28.869> is

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
to each every LED so it's that this is

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.529 
to each every LED so it's that this is
this<00:01:29.200> is<00:01:29.319> a<00:01:29.349> crying<00:01:29.740> color<00:01:30.209> and<00:01:31.209> then<00:01:31.360> I've

00:01:31.529 --> 00:01:31.539 
this is a crying color and then I've

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:33.419 
this is a crying color and then I've
also<00:01:31.720> picked<00:01:32.200> up<00:01:32.289> from<00:01:32.470> the<00:01:32.649> electronics<00:01:33.250> shop

00:01:33.419 --> 00:01:33.429 
also picked up from the electronics shop

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:37.130 
also picked up from the electronics shop
they<00:01:34.179> are<00:01:34.300> about<00:01:34.509> a<00:01:34.539> dollar<00:01:34.810> dollar<00:01:35.170> each<00:01:35.410> and

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
they are about a dollar dollar each and

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.650 
they are about a dollar dollar each and
in<00:01:38.140> the<00:01:38.259> helmet<00:01:38.590> so<00:01:39.130> I'm<00:01:39.670> going<00:01:39.849> to<00:01:39.910> get<00:01:40.539> this

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:40.660 
in the helmet so I'm going to get this

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.779 
in the helmet so I'm going to get this
in<00:01:40.929> I'm<00:01:41.289> going<00:01:41.470> to<00:01:41.530> cut<00:01:41.709> basically<00:01:42.459> cut<00:01:42.640> this

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:42.789 
in I'm going to cut basically cut this

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:46.529 
in I'm going to cut basically cut this
first<00:01:43.000> potential<00:01:43.810> inside<00:01:44.399> I'll<00:01:45.539> manipulate

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:46.539 
first potential inside I'll manipulate

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:49.169 
first potential inside I'll manipulate
the<00:01:46.690> lights<00:01:46.899> until<00:01:47.590> they<00:01:47.890> have<00:01:48.729> the<00:01:48.819> desired

00:01:49.169 --> 00:01:49.179 
the lights until they have the desired

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:50.699 
the lights until they have the desired
effect<00:01:49.270> that<00:01:49.599> there's<00:01:49.750> no<00:01:49.899> that's<00:01:50.319> that's

00:01:50.699 --> 00:01:50.709 
effect that there's no that's that's

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:53.130 
effect that there's no that's that's
missing<00:01:51.130> and<00:01:51.670> we'll<00:01:52.330> see<00:01:52.479> what<00:01:52.630> goes<00:01:52.959> from

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
missing and we'll see what goes from

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.059 
missing and we'll see what goes from
there<00:01:53.910> I've<00:01:54.910> switched<00:01:55.270> to<00:01:55.569> blue<00:01:55.959> LEDs<00:01:56.709> from

00:01:57.059 --> 00:01:57.069 
there I've switched to blue LEDs from

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:00.270 
there I've switched to blue LEDs from
the<00:01:57.280> crayon<00:01:58.060> or<00:01:58.300> green<00:01:58.569> it<00:01:59.440> gives<00:01:59.860> it<00:01:59.979> more<00:02:00.039> of

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
the crayon or green it gives it more of

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:07.370 
the crayon or green it gives it more of
a<00:02:00.369> fit<00:02:00.610> and<00:02:00.910> I<00:02:01.869> have<00:02:02.140> installed<00:02:03.929> the<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:06.759> blue

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
a fit and I have installed the the blue

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:14.190 
a fit and I have installed the the blue
folder<00:02:08.380> strips<00:02:09.420> inside<00:02:12.510> and<00:02:13.510> if<00:02:13.690> I<00:02:13.780> place<00:02:13.989> this

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
folder strips inside and if I place this

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.660 
folder strips inside and if I place this
over<00:02:14.560> we<00:02:14.800> might<00:02:14.950> be<00:02:15.069> able<00:02:15.190> to<00:02:15.310> see<00:02:16.230> yes<00:02:17.550> if<00:02:18.550> we

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
over we might be able to see yes if we

thank you son and what I'm going to do
is<00:02:50.790> you<00:02:50.910> may<00:02:51.030> use<00:02:51.180> a<00:02:51.209> soldering<00:02:51.660> iron<00:02:51.930> and<00:02:52.230> I'm

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
is you may use a soldering iron and I'm

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.820 
is you may use a soldering iron and I'm
going<00:02:52.860> to<00:02:53.010> put<00:02:53.580> some<00:02:53.760> solder<00:02:54.030> on<00:02:54.260> to<00:02:55.260> the

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
going to put some solder on to the

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.560 
going to put some solder on to the
exposed<00:02:56.190> wires<00:02:56.519> just<00:02:56.730> to<00:02:57.060> make<00:02:57.209> sure<00:02:57.390> that

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
exposed wires just to make sure that

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.240 
exposed wires just to make sure that
they<00:02:58.019> are<00:02:58.230> definitely<00:02:58.739> not<00:02:58.890> going<00:02:58.980> to<00:02:59.100> come

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
they are definitely not going to come

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.340 
they are definitely not going to come
undone<00:02:59.690> also<00:03:00.690> you<00:03:00.780> could<00:03:00.870> probably<00:03:01.050> use<00:03:01.230> a<00:03:01.260> bit

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
undone also you could probably use a bit

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.560 
undone also you could probably use a bit
of<00:03:01.410> tape<00:03:01.560> but<00:03:01.739> I'm<00:03:01.830> going<00:03:01.950> to<00:03:02.010> do<00:03:02.130> the<00:03:02.519> you<00:03:03.450> know

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
of tape but I'm going to do the you know

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.390 
of tape but I'm going to do the you know
the<00:03:03.690> best<00:03:03.810> method<00:03:04.140> I<00:03:04.260> can<00:03:04.320> and<00:03:04.739> then<00:03:05.190> I'm<00:03:05.250> going

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
the best method I can and then I'm going

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.479 
the best method I can and then I'm going
to<00:03:05.430> use<00:03:05.550> a<00:03:05.580> bit<00:03:05.700> of<00:03:05.790> heat<00:03:05.940> shrink<00:03:07.310> some<00:03:08.310> heat

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
to use a bit of heat shrink some heat

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:09.890 
to use a bit of heat shrink some heat
shrink<00:03:08.519> there<00:03:08.910> and<00:03:09.120> I'm<00:03:09.510> going<00:03:09.630> to<00:03:09.660> put<00:03:09.810> it

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
shrink there and I'm going to put it

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.300 
shrink there and I'm going to put it
over<00:03:09.989> the<00:03:10.200> wires<00:03:10.380> and<00:03:10.680> it<00:03:10.800> should<00:03:10.980> look<00:03:11.100> really

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
over the wires and it should look really

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:22.300 
over the wires and it should look really
good

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.730 

and<00:03:22.910> the<00:03:23.690> last<00:03:23.840> thing<00:03:24.050> you<00:03:24.080> might<00:03:24.440> have<00:03:24.560> seen

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:24.740 
and the last thing you might have seen

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.770 
and the last thing you might have seen
me<00:03:25.069> in<00:03:25.400> the<00:03:25.730> helmets<00:03:26.150> but<00:03:26.420> then<00:03:26.600> you<00:03:26.660> probably

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
me in the helmets but then you probably

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:27.970 
me in the helmets but then you probably
might<00:03:27.230> have<00:03:27.350> seen<00:03:27.500> my<00:03:27.590> son<00:03:27.800> in<00:03:27.890> the

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
might have seen my son in the

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.309 
might have seen my son in the
backgrounds<00:03:28.580> that<00:03:29.170> wasn't<00:03:30.170> scripted<00:03:30.670> anyway

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
backgrounds that wasn't scripted anyway

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:36.760 
backgrounds that wasn't scripted anyway
I've<00:03:33.319> taken<00:03:33.590> the<00:03:34.430> top<00:03:34.730> parts<00:03:35.060> off<00:03:35.680> because<00:03:36.680> I

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:36.770 
I've taken the top parts off because I

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.040 
I've taken the top parts off because I
need<00:03:36.950> to<00:03:37.130> do<00:03:37.880> some<00:03:38.060> painting<00:03:38.300> underneath<00:03:38.870> it

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050 
need to do some painting underneath it

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.760 
need to do some painting underneath it
so<00:03:39.709> I<00:03:39.739> thought<00:03:40.220> I'd<00:03:40.370> take<00:03:40.670> them<00:03:40.790> off<00:03:40.970> now<00:03:41.000> just

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 
so I thought I'd take them off now just

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.840 
so I thought I'd take them off now just
because<00:03:42.770> I've<00:03:42.860> got<00:03:42.890> a<00:03:43.010> got<00:03:43.430> to<00:03:43.520> do<00:03:43.670> some<00:03:43.819> more

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
because I've got a got to do some more

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:47.320 
because I've got a got to do some more
painting<00:03:44.530> anyway<00:03:45.530> I'll<00:03:46.430> show<00:03:46.489> you<00:03:47.030> what<00:03:47.239> it

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
painting anyway I'll show you what it

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.580 
painting anyway I'll show you what it
looks<00:03:47.480> like<00:03:47.600> inside<00:03:48.020> and<00:03:48.290> how<00:03:48.380> wired<00:03:48.739> it<00:03:50.590> so

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
looks like inside and how wired it so

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.930 
looks like inside and how wired it so
I've<00:03:52.010> got<00:03:52.370> the<00:03:53.410> battery<00:03:54.410> pack<00:03:54.709> attached<00:03:55.670> to

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.660 
the top of the helmet my head still fits
in<00:03:59.030> there<00:03:59.330> it<00:04:00.190> doesn't<00:04:01.190> get<00:04:01.280> in<00:04:01.370> the<00:04:01.400> way<00:04:01.459> at

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
in there it doesn't get in the way at

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.320 
in there it doesn't get in the way at
all<00:04:01.820> and<00:04:02.660> I've<00:04:03.170> got<00:04:03.350> the<00:04:03.470> lights<00:04:03.739> set<00:04:04.220> up<00:04:04.370> down

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
of it makes it darker down there so I've

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.719 
of it makes it darker down there so I've
got<00:04:13.519> to<00:04:13.700> set<00:04:14.060> up<00:04:14.180> for<00:04:14.930> the<00:04:15.080> bottom<00:04:15.530> visor<00:04:16.340> and

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729 
got to set up for the bottom visor and

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:18.909 
got to set up for the bottom visor and
then<00:04:17.209> I've<00:04:17.299> got<00:04:17.450> two<00:04:17.690> on<00:04:18.019> the<00:04:18.440> top<00:04:18.680> of<00:04:18.829> the

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 
then I've got two on the top of the

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:21.699 
then I've got two on the top of the
helmet<00:04:19.130> not<00:04:19.850> sit<00:04:20.419> directly<00:04:20.660> on<00:04:21.049> the<00:04:21.229> visor<00:04:21.380> but

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
helmet not sit directly on the visor but

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.190 
helmet not sit directly on the visor but
at<00:04:21.829> the<00:04:21.950> top<00:04:22.160> to<00:04:22.910> give<00:04:23.090> it<00:04:23.120> like<00:04:23.300> a<00:04:23.330> like<00:04:23.900> an

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
at the top to give it like a like an
