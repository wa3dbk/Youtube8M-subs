00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.719 
far as running these guys did not work
out<00:01:51.570> for<00:01:51.630> me<00:01:51.899> I<00:01:52.170> don't<00:01:53.130> know<00:01:53.369> if<00:01:53.490> they<00:01:53.579> had

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729

00:01:53.729 --> 00:02:01.880 
out for me I don't know if they had
another<00:01:54.030> period<00:01:54.390> that<00:01:54.630> was<00:01:54.869> bigger<00:01:55.560> and

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.430 

they<00:02:02.580> didn't<00:02:02.850> actually<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.630> ones<00:02:03.840> that<00:02:04.110> I

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
they didn't actually the ones that I

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.090 
they didn't actually the ones that I
think<00:02:04.590> there<00:02:04.860> was<00:02:05.180> $39.99<00:02:06.180> 40<00:02:06.600> bucks<00:02:06.810> and

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
think there was $39.99 40 bucks and

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.969 
think there was $39.99 40 bucks and
actually<00:02:08.100> go<00:02:08.280> in<00:02:08.580> your<00:02:08.789> lob<00:02:09.360> you<00:02:09.660> know

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
actually go in your lob you know

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.290 
actually go in your lob you know
actually<00:02:10.979> set<00:02:11.280> on<00:02:11.490> your<00:02:11.670> ear<00:02:11.880> and<00:02:14.210> maybe<00:02:15.210> I

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
actually set on your ear and maybe I

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.850 
actually set on your ear and maybe I
should<00:02:15.510> have<00:02:15.600> went<00:02:15.750> with<00:02:15.780> now<00:02:16.020> you<00:02:16.560> know<00:02:16.650> I

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
should have went with now you know I

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.290 
should have went with now you know I
thought<00:02:17.220> that<00:02:17.460> these<00:02:17.610> might<00:02:18.000> be<00:02:20.000> would<00:02:21.000> work

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
thought that these might be would work

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:29.540 
thought that these might be would work
and<00:02:21.830> they<00:02:22.830> don't<00:02:23.060> so<00:02:27.800> anybody<00:02:28.800> interested<00:02:29.430> in

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
and they don't so anybody interested in

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.730 
and they don't so anybody interested in
getting<00:02:29.850> is<00:02:30.180> just<00:02:30.510> my<00:02:30.870> opinion<00:02:30.930> you<00:02:31.560> know<00:02:31.620> they

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
getting is just my opinion you know they

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.040 
getting is just my opinion you know they
could<00:02:31.980> work<00:02:32.190> for<00:02:32.370> others<00:02:32.640> but<00:02:32.820> for<00:02:33.060> me<00:02:33.240> they

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
could work for others but for me they

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.890 
could work for others but for me they
did<00:02:34.380> not<00:02:34.770> work<00:02:35.130> and<00:02:35.430> they're<00:02:35.670> not<00:02:35.700> good<00:02:36.630> for

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
did not work and they're not good for

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.380 
did not work and they're not good for
running<00:02:37.670> and<00:02:38.670> and<00:02:39.600> another<00:02:39.959> thing<00:02:40.320> is<00:02:40.590> if<00:02:41.390> you

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
running and and another thing is if you
