00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.990
 the poles within is an exercise in 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.910
 relaxation in which we maintain 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.680
 the horse's shoulders on a track 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.980
 interior to that followed by the 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.380
 hips 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.480
 the horse is slightly toyer by 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.329
 the action of the helps and moves in the 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.339
 external side to the incubation angle 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.290
 formed by the body with the line of 

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:41.690
 displacement determines the number of 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.239
 small rhinestones and 3.6 weak English 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.239
 4.6 the tab more or less marked they do not 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.680
 generally do not exceed 30 degrees 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:51.079
 the shoulder within is realized at 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.879
 trotting and galloping on straight lines 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.229
 as on curves 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:55.699
 this relaxation has 

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:57.260
 many virtues he works 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:59.210
 equilibrium of the horse thanks to 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.559
 engagement of the posterior inner 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.360
 that helps lower the hip 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.239
 inside and work their 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.010
 further assembly the posterior assures 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.659
 propulsion which allows the 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.299
 strengthen and soften 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:13.430
 the shoulders are over book since the 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:14.990
 Alex horse are in front and ruffles 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.450
 in pace also the pace 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.990
 improves straightness especially in gallo 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.189
 and lightens the galloping horse 7 your 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.630
 riders must be able 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:25.670
 to make long jars or 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.289
 a counter-shoulder in the foot and 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.299
 trot on both sides 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:31.009
 at the prerequisite level the mastery of 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:33.350
 shoulders and angels in curva sion 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:34.960
 step and trot is essential 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.759
 as well as the independence of 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.890
 during specific relaxation ask for a 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.299
 maximum of incubation change on 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.549
 the eight two digits at death 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:44.990
 infantile four loops in order to 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:48.640
 solicit horses and riders 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.640
 in the incubation aids 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.190
 teens the ruffles that goes into 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.510
 place via the incubation aids by 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.030
 example on a circle 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.250
 the inner agent but that seems so 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.810
 to manage the fold and the activity while 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.450
 pushing the horse into the movement 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.850
 while the outside hand control 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.000
 the outer poles by managing languages ​​and 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.770
 regulating the fold and lama activity 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.840
 inside gives crease and the agent 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.630
 outside slightly behind 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.160
 there seem to control the hips the 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.440
 body weight is oriented in the direction 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.000
 from the outward movement with a 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.459
 slight weight transfer on the stage 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.170
 outer 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.640
 it is important that your riders place 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.250
 and uses their help so 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.900
 discontinuous so as to facilitate 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.660
 relaxation of the start and 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.760
 encourage the horse hasebe the contact 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.590
 must be me so that the horse 7 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.870
 on the inner leg and do take 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.980
 no support on are dead 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.019
 attention also to the management of 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.760
 body weight to facilitate 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.530
 the use of money inside 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.420
 riders tend to transfer 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.920
 their weight inside and not to 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.720
 outdoors 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.459
 this has the detrimental effect of 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.560
 inner posterior who is struggling 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.390
 engage under the mass force yourself 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.340
 riders to lightly press on their 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.180
 buttocks outside looking in the 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.180
 direction of movement 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:06.349
 at first you have to 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.239
 to make our riders aware of 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:11.390
 the importance of the role of the leg 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:13.940
 interior indeed the home agent has 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.410
 here an active role in the sense that it's 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.830
 she who sleeps the horse in the 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.900
 movement 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.750
 in addition to managing the activity and 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.700
 incubation to sensitize your 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.890
 riders on this fundamental principle 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.989
 you can ask them to enlarge a 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.480
 circle by touching the shoulders around 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.280
 the inner leg scattered your 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.470
 riders in the workspace is 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.200
 set up on small circles 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.269
 from 6 to 10 meters at the materialized center 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.950
 by a plot on demand they 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:41.720
 enlarge the circle by pushing the 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.150
 horse outward with the help of 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.980
 the internal agent 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.780
 attention in recurring problems 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.760
 we often see riders fill 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.799
 a lack of response to the leg by 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.840
 a queen of support the inner hand 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:55.819
 normally in 22 opening comes 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.610
 place on the other side to push the 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:00.170
 shoulders react immediately by their 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.650
 asking to strengthen their legs 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.650
 inside 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:18.180
 if you have a workspace 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.760
 big enough to materialize your area by 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:23.040
 two parts a control moor where 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.110
 you examine your riders and a rom 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.630
 of training where our riders can 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.340
 to carry out the exercise independently in order to 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.650
 do not stay too long 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.780
 wait for the best way to prepare 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.470
 with one shoulder inside and to precede it 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.180
 of a circle 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.850
 which is often the case in 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.740
 amateur dressage occasions the circle 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.810
 from six to eight meters to walk and from there 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.900
 trotting makes it possible to place 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.889
 aids and curvature the horse 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.400
 individually with large 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:49.410
 distances 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.930
 ask your riders to draw a 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:54.720
 circle at the exit of a corner for example 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.850
 at the end of the circle the shoulders are pulled out 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.340
 of the horse as if we wanted to leave on 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.560
 a second volts and at that moment the 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.750
 inner leg acted to push the 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.270
 horse in the movement while the 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.350
 outdoor hand block the outer shoulder 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.570
 to maintain languages 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:11.250
 at first asked the shoulder 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.960
 in donations over a few meters only 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.080
 effects ended the movement by a 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.700
 circle in order to keep the orientation 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.640
 you can materialize the angle of 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:22.410
 traveling with a bar on the ground 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:24.030
 started the exercise at a pace but do not forget 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:26.310
 not to make the horses leave again 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.419
 activity after exercise by a 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.120
 rising transition 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:32.190
 if exercise and hop asked for a departure 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.630
 trot if exercising and others to 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.120
 requests and lengthening 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:38.070
 in a second time to increase the 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.780
 difficulty you can turn on the 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.580
 distance from the movement or do it 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:44.250
 precede the shoulder within only 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:46.470
 of a passage of a corner the observables of 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:48.990
 the shoulder in in its constancy of 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:51.450
 the 30 degree orientation the management of 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:53.729
 curving the engagement of the posterior 

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:55.830
 interior with no crossover 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:59.270
 hinders and the maintenance of 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.270
 activity and rhythm 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.290
 we often encounter problems 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.680
 recurring during shoulder work 

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:09.410
 inside 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.350
 first of all the problem of the horse too much 

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:13.670
 folded compared to few poles 

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:15.920
 the action of the inner ama is too much 

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:18.590
 strong compared to the outside hand 

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.340
 the horse is too bent but the angle is 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:21.980
 too weak 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:25.600
 in this case ask your riders to 

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.600
 strengthen their outer hands 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:32.169
 we can also meet the problem 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:34.270
 inverse to know far too much angle 

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:36.910
 the shoulder inside is a work of 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:38.650
 three tracks if the ship is struggling to 

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:41.470
 measure the action of his outside hand 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:43.449
 language can become too important the 

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:46.030
 horse lose to activity and will cross 

00:06:43.449 --> 00:06:48.100
 the hindquarters must then reinforced 

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:49.810
 his inner leg and reduce the action 

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:53.169
 of the outside hand by keeping it 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:55.060
 low so we can see well on the picture 

00:06:53.169 --> 00:06:56.470
 from left there is far too much angle the 

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.820
 horse moves on four tracks 

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:59.650
 crossed posterior 

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:01.419
 everything is done in contraction the 

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:02.050
 outdoor hand rider much 

00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:04.449
 too high 

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:07.289
 the horse is locked up and has his mouth 

00:07:04.449 --> 00:07:07.289
 totally open 

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:11.469
 another problem we encounter 

00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:13.780
 often if the horse swerves in 

00:07:11.469 --> 00:07:15.310
 leaving the track inwards is 

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:16.990
 often a lack of inner legs and 

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:18.639
 riders tend to bring back 

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:20.020
 shoulders thanks to a support queen like 

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:22.569
 we saw it during the problems related to 

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:24.159
 the exercise of preparation they bring back 

00:07:22.569 --> 00:07:26.110
 their hands and laughing outward 

00:07:24.159 --> 00:07:27.729
 pulling ask them to react 

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:29.560
 immediately by drawing a new 

00:07:27.729 --> 00:07:30.789
 circle before re asked the shoulder in 

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.979
 in reinforcing their flights 

00:07:30.789 --> 00:07:34.659
 interiors they can also bring back the 

00:07:32.979 --> 00:07:36.490
 horseback to the track only with 

00:07:34.659 --> 00:07:38.530
 the home agent keeping his hand at 

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:41.789
 the inside spread as when 

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:41.789
 the preparation exercise
