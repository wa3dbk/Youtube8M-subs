one<00:00:33.200> of<00:00:33.260> the<00:00:33.350> cool<00:00:33.470> things<00:00:33.710> that<00:00:33.860> Jason<00:00:34.760> and

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
one of the cool things that Jason and

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.410 
one of the cool things that Jason and
Marti<00:00:35.120> used<00:00:35.270> to<00:00:35.390> do<00:00:35.540> here<00:00:36.440> is<00:00:36.590> a<00:00:36.910> phrase<00:00:37.910> which

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
Marti used to do here is a phrase which

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.729 
Marti used to do here is a phrase which
is<00:00:38.540> very<00:00:38.690> similar<00:00:38.870> to<00:00:41.470> that<00:00:42.470> what<00:00:42.590> we're<00:00:42.680> gonna

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
is very similar to that what we're gonna

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:45.160 
is very similar to that what we're gonna
do<00:00:42.949> is<00:00:43.100> we're<00:00:43.190> gonna<00:00:43.269> cross<00:00:44.269> strings<00:00:44.690> this<00:00:44.960> way

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
do is we're gonna cross strings this way

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.610 
do is we're gonna cross strings this way
okay<00:00:45.890> so<00:00:46.760> it'll<00:00:46.879> sum<00:00:47.120> and<00:00:47.480> here's<00:00:48.170> how<00:00:48.470> it's

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
okay so it'll sum and here's how it's

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.220 
okay so it'll sum and here's how it's
going<00:00:48.739> to<00:00:48.800> be<00:00:48.920> different<00:00:49.870> I'm<00:00:50.870> gonna<00:00:51.019> do<00:00:51.110> is

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
going to be different I'm gonna do is

00:00:51.230 --> 00:01:01.360 
going to be different I'm gonna do is
I'm<00:00:51.350> gonna<00:00:51.409> accent<00:00:52.900> an<00:00:53.900> E<00:00:54.170> major<00:00:54.500> chord<00:01:00.370> final

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
I'm gonna accent an E major chord final

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:07.060 
I'm gonna accent an E major chord final
go<00:01:01.460> down<00:01:01.579> to<00:01:01.670> the<00:01:02.410> so

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.310 

that's<00:01:08.070> gonna<00:01:08.220> be<00:01:08.370> the<00:01:08.460> basis<00:01:08.820> for<00:01:09.090> how<00:01:09.270> I

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
that's gonna be the basis for how I

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.800 
that's gonna be the basis for how I
determine<00:01:10.320> what<00:01:10.730> I<00:01:11.730> start<00:01:12.120> on<00:01:12.270> with<00:01:12.510> these

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
determine what I start on with these

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.190 
determine what I start on with these
little<00:01:13.290> patterns<00:01:13.820> so<00:01:14.820> here's<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:15.630> was<00:01:15.780> gonna<00:01:15.870> go

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
little patterns so here's I was gonna go

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.550 
little patterns so here's I was gonna go
hi<00:01:17.190> we<00:01:17.580> have<00:01:17.640> this<00:01:21.020> next<00:01:22.020> on<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.170> B<00:01:22.260> string<00:01:22.320> we

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
hi we have this next on the B string we

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.600 
hi we have this next on the B string we
have<00:01:22.680> this<00:01:25.670> the<00:01:26.670> next<00:01:26.880> step<00:01:27.030> start<00:01:27.540> with<00:01:27.720> that

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
have this the next step start with that

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.680 
have this the next step start with that
the<00:01:29.610> index<00:01:29.850> finger<00:01:30.030> on<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.180> g<00:01:30.270> sharp<00:01:30.450> I<00:01:30.540> have

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 
the index finger on the g sharp I have

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.420 
the index finger on the g sharp I have
this<00:01:33.500> so<00:01:34.500> far<00:01:34.710> with<00:01:34.830> those<00:01:34.950> three<00:01:35.130> strings<00:01:35.280> you

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
this so far with those three strings you

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.050 
this so far with those three strings you
have<00:01:35.460> this<00:01:38.240> next<00:01:39.240> ism<00:01:39.479> I'm<00:01:40.080> gonna<00:01:40.290> pretty<00:01:40.860> much

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
have this next ism I'm gonna pretty much

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.670 
have this next ism I'm gonna pretty much
grab<00:01:42.060> that<00:01:42.180> index<00:01:42.450> finger<00:01:42.660> here<00:01:42.810> continue

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
grab that index finger here continue

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:51.370 
grab that index finger here continue
down<00:01:45.979> B<00:01:46.979> string<00:01:47.280> sorry<00:01:47.640> on<00:01:47.760> the<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.880> string

and<00:01:52.380> then<00:01:52.710> on<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.280> low<00:01:53.370> e-string

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.730 

I'll<00:01:57.720> probably<00:01:57.870> just<00:01:58.080> end<00:01:58.140> up<00:01:58.230> sliding<00:01:58.530> down

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
I'll probably just end up sliding down

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:08.520 
I'll probably just end up sliding down
