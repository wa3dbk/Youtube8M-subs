720<00:00:43.590> resolution<00:00:43.920> i<00:00:44.670> think<00:00:44.850> it's<00:00:44.969> 256<00:00:45.870> pixels

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
720 resolution i think it's 256 pixels

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.660 
720 resolution i think it's 256 pixels
per<00:00:46.320> inch<00:00:46.350> I'm<00:00:46.770> actually<00:00:46.950> not<00:00:47.190> reading<00:00:47.579> this

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
per inch I'm actually not reading this

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:48.740 
per inch I'm actually not reading this
I'm<00:00:47.820> doing<00:00:48.120> this<00:00:48.180> off<00:00:48.329> top<00:00:48.450> of<00:00:48.570> my<00:00:48.660> head

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
I'm doing this off top of my head

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.389 
I'm doing this off top of my head
because<00:00:48.899> I<00:00:49.020> remember<00:00:49.140> this<00:00:49.320> phone<00:00:49.530> so<00:00:49.739> well<00:00:49.890> I

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
because I remember this phone so well I

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.369 
because I remember this phone so well I
think<00:00:50.789> it's<00:00:50.969> 206<00:00:51.539> pixels<00:00:51.870> per<00:00:51.960> inch<00:00:52.020> maybe<00:00:52.260> a

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
think it's 206 pixels per inch maybe a

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.549 
think it's 206 pixels per inch maybe a
little<00:00:52.559> bit<00:00:52.710> lower<00:00:52.920> so<00:00:53.820> that's<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.329> only

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
little bit lower so that's the only

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:57.229 
little bit lower so that's the only
downside<00:00:55.559> is<00:00:55.770> that<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.219> galaxy<00:00:56.640> s3<00:00:57.000> has<00:00:57.210> a

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
downside is that the galaxy s3 has a

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.119 
downside is that the galaxy s3 has a
more<00:00:57.660> pixels<00:00:58.020> per<00:00:58.199> inch<00:00:58.260> that's<00:00:58.829> only<00:00:58.980> because

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
more pixels per inch that's only because

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.920 
more pixels per inch that's only because
the<00:00:59.280> galaxy<00:00:59.640> s3<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.210> current<00:01:00.449> flagship

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
the galaxy s3 the current flagship

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.630 
the galaxy s3 the current flagship
device<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:01.440> them<00:01:01.980> as<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.190> little<00:01:02.340> bit<00:01:02.430> smaller

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
device is them as a little bit smaller

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.090 
device is them as a little bit smaller
screen<00:01:02.879> at<00:01:02.969> 4.7<00:01:03.480> inches<00:01:03.809> so<00:01:04.650> one<00:01:04.769> more<00:01:04.949> thing

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
also comes with a quad-core cpu clocked

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.330 
also comes with a quad-core cpu clocked
at<00:01:53.579> 1.6<00:01:54.149> gigahertz<00:01:54.420> was<00:01:54.689> blows<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.560> galaxy<00:01:55.979> s3

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
at 1.6 gigahertz was blows the galaxy s3

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.889 
at 1.6 gigahertz was blows the galaxy s3
out<00:01:56.430> of<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.579> water<00:01:56.790> I<00:01:57.390> think<00:01:57.780> the

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
out of the water I think the

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.630 
out of the water I think the
International<00:01:58.530> versions<00:01:58.829> of<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:58.979> galaxy<00:01:59.340> s3

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
International versions of the galaxy s3

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.459 
International versions of the galaxy s3
have<00:01:59.759> also<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.149> quad<00:02:00.360> core<00:02:00.540> processor<00:02:01.020> but

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
have also the quad core processor but

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:02.719 
have also the quad core processor but
it's<00:02:01.500> not<00:02:01.740> clocked<00:02:02.040> as<00:02:02.189> high<00:02:02.340> i<00:02:02.369> think<00:02:02.610> it's

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
it's not clocked as high i think it's

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.190 
it's not clocked as high i think it's
1.4<00:02:03.450> gigahertz<00:02:03.810> don't<00:02:04.200> quote<00:02:04.350> me<00:02:04.530> I<00:02:04.680> think<00:02:04.979> I

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
1.4 gigahertz don't quote me I think I

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.389 
1.4 gigahertz don't quote me I think I
doing<00:02:05.409> to<00:02:05.469> talk<00:02:05.560> about<00:02:05.649> top<00:02:05.890> my<00:02:05.979> head<00:02:06.009> like<00:02:06.280> i

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 
doing to talk about top my head like i

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:08.219 
doing to talk about top my head like i
said<00:02:06.610> i<00:02:06.850> think<00:02:07.360> the<00:02:07.570> international<00:02:08.200> version

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
said i think the international version

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.650 
said i think the international version
of<00:02:08.530> the<00:02:08.590> galaxy<00:02:08.709> s3<00:02:09.129> is<00:02:09.190> a<00:02:09.280> quad-core<00:02:09.550> a<00:02:09.819> 1.4

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
of the galaxy s3 is a quad-core a 1.4

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.040 
of the galaxy s3 is a quad-core a 1.4
gigahertz<00:02:11.129> CPU<00:02:12.129> so<00:02:12.970> not<00:02:13.390> quite<00:02:13.599> as<00:02:13.870> good<00:02:13.989> as

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
gigahertz CPU so not quite as good as

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.290 
gigahertz CPU so not quite as good as
the<00:02:14.379> Galaxy<00:02:14.950> Note<00:02:14.980> 2<00:02:15.160> and<00:02:15.519> just<00:02:16.060> in<00:02:16.239> general
