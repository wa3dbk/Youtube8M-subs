00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:09.390
 well what kind of what action plan on 

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:11.550
 Today I propose to do a run 

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.140
 around the lake and then a couple of laps on 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.220
 the stadium we are new 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.220
 you should try him 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.800
 Stefan can tell the team about yourself 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:26.070
 well called Stefan 41 year doing 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.540
 jogging and a little mountain bike 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.320
 since the beginning of the year something is not very 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.320
 manage downhill 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:43.559
 what do you think for the evening will pull if 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.180
 seriously stefan why did you come 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.290
 work in college well firstly for 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.540
 me this is a unique opportunity 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.280
 engage in product development in 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.559
 second here i can keep running 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.000
 which is also very nice gift and 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.760
 Third I am very close and understandable 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.890
 philosophy brand college slogan everyone 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.260
 your pace of movement is really 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.940
 expresses a very important thought I certainly donâ€™t 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.430
 I can deny the desire to win 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.560
 to be honest and he himself is a sinner but the main thing 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.270
 I bring up the love of running in people 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.090
 teach them to enjoy it 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.700
 and what are you doing them 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.800
 work on a series of sneakers 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.929
 performance cyprus in particular over 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.060
 model m d that is medal distance 

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:23.340
 which is specially designed for the floor 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.280
 Marathon distance in my opinion is very 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.429
 good idea i also think that distance 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.679
 and the runner's body weight as in the design 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:33.960
 so when choosing sports shoes it 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:36.030
 two important criteria and you already have 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.100
 requirement for these models yes I have them 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.439
 full first need to find 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.720
 optimal combination between depreciation 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.060
 and dynamism do not forget that this 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.590
 model for half marathon so need 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.079
 count on several thousand blows 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.210
 on asphalt then it is also important to provide 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.829
 high quality products to jog 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.409
 the surface has long maintained its 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.490
 elasticity there is much more that is needed 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.070
 improve in sneakers 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.200
 for example to engage in ergonomics to raise 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.270
 the stability of the support on the turns in my opinion 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.789
 this direction is correct however 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.310
 let's see in general the work is still full 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:10.380
 I am very pleased to have the opportunity to work in 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.130
 college brand collective over such 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.130
 cool ideas
