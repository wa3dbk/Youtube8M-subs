like<00:01:46.110> that<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.350> lot<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.649> there's<00:01:47.210> just<00:01:48.210> a

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
like that a lot and there's just a

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.910 
like that a lot and there's just a
single<00:01:48.540> bar<00:01:48.810> across<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.140> no<00:01:49.470> bar<00:01:49.680> right<00:01:49.890> here
