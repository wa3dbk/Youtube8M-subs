00:00:38.439 --> 00:00:38.449 
know it's not planes whatever then I

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:40.869 
know it's not planes whatever then I
were<00:00:38.569> going<00:00:38.659> to<00:00:38.749> tuning<00:00:39.079> where<00:00:39.769> which<00:00:40.249> ended

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
were going to tuning where which ended

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:42.849 
were going to tuning where which ended
up<00:00:40.999> just<00:00:41.420> kind<00:00:41.629> of<00:00:41.719> a<00:00:41.809> man<00:00:42.079> I<00:00:42.289> never<00:00:42.379> really<00:00:42.710> got

00:00:42.849 --> 00:00:42.859 
up just kind of a man I never really got

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:46.239 
up just kind of a man I never really got
to<00:00:43.069> it<00:00:43.299> but<00:00:44.299> um<00:00:44.780> it<00:00:45.350> worked<00:00:45.530> out<00:00:45.679> further<00:00:46.039> well

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:46.249 
to it but um it worked out further well

00:00:46.249 --> 00:00:48.759 
to it but um it worked out further well
when<00:00:46.370> I<00:00:46.429> fled<00:00:46.579> back<00:00:46.819> before<00:00:47.299> but<00:00:48.049> I<00:00:48.379> just<00:00:48.679> never

00:00:48.759 --> 00:00:48.769 
when I fled back before but I just never

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:50.049 
when I fled back before but I just never
drew<00:00:49.039> it<00:00:49.159> so<00:00:49.249> i'll<00:00:49.339> probably<00:00:49.519> end<00:00:49.639> up<00:00:49.760> taking

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
drew it so i'll probably end up taking

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:54.160 
drew it so i'll probably end up taking
it<00:00:50.179> out<00:00:50.299> and<00:00:50.539> then<00:00:51.999> to<00:00:52.999> topple<00:00:53.359> warriors<00:00:53.690> this

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
it out and then to topple warriors this

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.279 
it out and then to topple warriors this
is<00:00:54.350> a<00:00:54.379> key<00:00:55.069> piece<00:00:55.309> to<00:00:55.719> making<00:00:56.719> one<00:00:56.839> of<00:00:56.869> the<00:00:56.989> next

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289 
is a key piece to making one of the next

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.609 
fives in the back and just lets you go
off<00:01:13.460> and<00:01:13.759> this<00:01:14.539> pretty<00:01:15.020> easy<00:01:15.229> to<00:01:15.320> get<00:01:15.409> to<00:01:15.590> and

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
off and this pretty easy to get to and

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:18.190 
off and this pretty easy to get to and
then<00:01:15.890> only<00:01:16.009> one<00:01:16.280> debris<00:01:16.549> dragon<00:01:16.909> um<00:01:17.899> the<00:01:18.140> only

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
then only one debris dragon um the only

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.069 
then only one debris dragon um the only
card<00:01:19.130> measured<00:01:19.490> i<00:01:19.549> think<00:01:19.759> it<00:01:20.299> can<00:01:20.479> really<00:01:20.630> well

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:21.079 
card measured i think it can really well

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:22.959 
card measured i think it can really well
they<00:01:21.229> can<00:01:21.469> make<00:01:21.679> scrap<00:01:21.950> driving<00:01:22.280> and<00:01:22.579> start<00:01:22.820> us

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:22.969 
they can make scrap driving and start us

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:26.709 
they can make scrap driving and start us
but<00:01:23.270> not<00:01:23.479> very<00:01:23.719> easily<00:01:25.390> besides<00:01:26.390> that<00:01:26.479> it

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:26.719 
but not very easily besides that it

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:29.770 
but not very easily besides that it
basically<00:01:26.810> just<00:01:27.200> makes<00:01:27.380> black<00:01:27.619> rose<00:01:27.829> i<00:01:28.780> guess

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
basically just makes black rose i guess

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.200 
basically just makes black rose i guess
one<00:01:29.960> time<00:01:30.140> I<00:01:30.289> did<00:01:30.590> bring<00:01:31.249> back<00:01:31.460> a<00:01:31.490> card<00:01:31.820> trooper

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
one time I did bring back a card trooper

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.359 
one time I did bring back a card trooper
and<00:01:32.390> just<00:01:33.259> kind<00:01:33.469> of<00:01:33.530> beat<00:01:33.679> somebody<00:01:34.070> down<00:01:34.219> to

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369

and just kind of beat somebody down to
that<00:01:34.520> field<00:01:34.789> in<00:01:35.030> a<00:01:35.119> dark<00:01:35.329> are<00:01:35.479> what<00:01:35.770> and<00:01:37.210> I<00:01:38.210> left

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
that field in a dark are what and I left

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.899 
that field in a dark are what and I left
that<00:01:40.659> relates<00:01:41.659> for<00:01:41.960> his<00:01:42.229> card<00:01:42.560> I<00:01:42.920> play<00:01:43.310> to

that relates for his card I play to

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.139 
that relates for his card I play to
raikos<00:01:44.240> on<00:01:44.390> Delilah<00:01:44.979> um<00:01:45.979> the<00:01:46.579> one<00:01:46.759> Lila

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
raikos on Delilah um the one Lila

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:48.700 
raikos on Delilah um the one Lila
immediate<00:01:47.960> really<00:01:48.140> gets<00:01:48.289> in<00:01:48.409> there<00:01:48.530> with<00:01:48.649> the

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
immediate really gets in there with the

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.249 
immediate really gets in there with the
back<00:01:48.859> row<00:01:49.130> and<00:01:49.490> then<00:01:49.640> right<00:01:50.359> goes<00:01:50.569> missing

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
back row and then right goes missing

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.149 
back row and then right goes missing
timing<00:01:51.679> and<00:01:51.799> all<00:01:51.859> that<00:01:52.069> nonsense<00:01:53.920> yeah<00:01:54.920> this

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
timing and all that nonsense yeah this

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:57.279 
timing and all that nonsense yeah this
is<00:01:55.310> the<00:01:55.460> new<00:01:55.579> map<00:01:55.789> that<00:01:55.969> I<00:01:56.030> want<00:01:56.240> you<00:01:56.780> know<00:01:56.899> I

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289 
is the new map that I want you know I

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:34.879 
novels and then 14 1 i'll probably take

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:37.119 
novels and then 14 1 i'll probably take
this<00:03:35.030> out<00:03:35.209> do<00:03:35.419> since<00:03:35.720> taking<00:03:36.560> tuning<00:03:36.949> we're

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:37.129 
this out do since taking tuning we're

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:39.129 
this out do since taking tuning we're
out<00:03:37.280> I<00:03:37.430> mean<00:03:37.579> it<00:03:37.669> gets<00:03:37.819> to<00:03:38.000> spore<00:03:38.329> and<00:03:38.659> maybe

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:39.139 
out I mean it gets to spore and maybe

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:41.469 
out I mean it gets to spore and maybe
veiler<00:03:39.590> beyond<00:03:39.859> that<00:03:40.159> it's<00:03:41.090> just<00:03:41.239> not<00:03:41.359> as<00:03:41.449> good

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:41.479 
veiler beyond that it's just not as good

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:43.990 
veiler beyond that it's just not as good
without<00:03:41.720> boil<00:03:42.049> over<00:03:42.290> the<00:03:42.530> picture<00:03:42.709> and<00:03:43.549> then
