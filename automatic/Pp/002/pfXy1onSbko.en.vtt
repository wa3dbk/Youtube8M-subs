00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.090 

still<00:01:12.890> playing<00:01:13.100> domination<00:01:13.820> here<00:01:14.060> hopefully

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
still playing domination here hopefully

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.520 
still playing domination here hopefully
but<00:01:16.100> each<00:01:16.219> of<00:01:16.369> spawn<00:01:16.610> there<00:01:16.930> now<00:01:17.930> he<00:01:17.990> was<00:01:18.289> just

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
but each of spawn there now he was just

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.889 
but each of spawn there now he was just
I<00:01:18.920> guess<00:01:19.640> he<00:01:19.880> was<00:01:20.000> he<00:01:20.210> did<00:01:20.390> spawn<00:01:20.659> he<00:01:20.810> was

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:20.899 
I guess he was he did spawn he was

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:22.060 
I guess he was he did spawn he was
coming<00:01:21.170> out<00:01:21.229> of<00:01:21.289> spawn<00:01:21.560> but<00:01:21.710> we're<00:01:21.860> playing

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
coming out of spawn but we're playing

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.789 
coming out of spawn but we're playing
out<00:01:22.250> some<00:01:22.460> domination<00:01:23.090> and<00:01:23.649> I'll<00:01:24.649> probably

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
out some domination and I'll probably

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:26.919 
out some domination and I'll probably
switch<00:01:25.159> it<00:01:25.310> up<00:01:25.399> to<00:01:25.549> kill<00:01:25.850> confirm<00:01:26.270> I<00:01:26.509> feel<00:01:26.719> like

00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:26.929 
switch it up to kill confirm I feel like

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:29.289 
switch it up to kill confirm I feel like
I<00:01:27.409> don't<00:01:27.860> know<00:01:28.039> man<00:01:28.369> even<00:01:28.759> though<00:01:28.909> this<00:01:29.119> is

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 
I don't know man even though this is

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:30.880 
I don't know man even though this is
domination<00:01:29.689> ground<00:01:30.079> water<00:01:30.319> feels<00:01:30.619> like<00:01:30.770> it

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
domination ground water feels like it

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.730 
domination ground water feels like it
plays<00:01:31.069> so<00:01:31.460> much<00:01:31.640> slower<00:01:31.939> than<00:01:32.409> that<00:01:33.409> I<00:01:33.439> just

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
plays so much slower than that I just

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.109 
plays so much slower than that I just
really<00:01:34.039> get<00:01:34.159> a<00:01:34.189> hitmarker<00:01:34.399> there's<00:01:34.970> gonna

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
really get a hitmarker there's gonna

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:36.910 
really get a hitmarker there's gonna
usually<00:01:35.810> get<00:01:36.170> to<00:01:36.200> one<00:01:36.380> shot<00:01:36.590> kill<00:01:36.740> all<00:01:36.860> the

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
usually get to one shot kill all the

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.050 
usually get to one shot kill all the
time<00:01:38.679> feels<00:01:39.679> like<00:01:39.950> you<00:01:40.579> know<00:01:40.670> even<00:01:40.700> though

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
time feels like you know even though

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.120 
time feels like you know even though
this<00:01:41.270> is<00:01:41.479> ground<00:01:41.780> war<00:01:41.990> 99<00:01:42.560> it<00:01:42.770> feels<00:01:42.950> like

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
this is ground war 99 it feels like

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.160 
this is ground war 99 it feels like
he'll<00:01:43.399> confirm<00:01:43.759> is<00:01:44.000> still<00:01:44.270> a<00:01:44.299> lot<00:01:44.479> faster<00:01:45.020> man

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
he'll confirm is still a lot faster man

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.020 
he'll confirm is still a lot faster man
I<00:01:45.200> don't<00:01:45.560> know<00:01:45.619> why<00:01:45.799> I<00:01:45.830> guess<00:01:46.340> cuz<00:01:46.610> a<00:01:46.640> lot<00:01:46.819> of

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
I don't know why I guess cuz a lot of

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.149 
I don't know why I guess cuz a lot of
people<00:01:47.270> are<00:01:47.450> you<00:01:48.380> know<00:01:48.500> getting<00:01:48.799> the<00:01:48.830> killed

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
people are you know getting the killed

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:54.969 
people are you know getting the killed
where<00:01:49.759> are<00:01:50.090> you<00:01:52.360> wow<00:01:53.360> what<00:01:53.659> a<00:01:53.720> creep<00:01:54.110> man<00:01:54.380> nice

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
where are you wow what a creep man nice

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.139 
where are you wow what a creep man nice
is<00:01:55.310> creeping<00:01:55.880> around<00:01:56.090> the<00:01:56.270> corner<00:01:56.780> so<00:01:57.020> slowly

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.149 
is creeping around the corner so slowly

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:00.429 
is creeping around the corner so slowly
but<00:01:59.149> I<00:01:59.179> guess<00:01:59.509> since<00:01:59.689> everyone's<00:02:00.259> getting

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
but I guess since everyone's getting

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:03.100 
but I guess since everyone's getting
kills<00:02:00.770> trying<00:02:01.520> to<00:02:01.580> get<00:02:01.700> their<00:02:01.849> tags<00:02:02.119> you<00:02:02.990> know

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
kills trying to get their tags you know

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.469 
kills trying to get their tags you know
to<00:02:03.170> get<00:02:03.439> the<00:02:03.560> extra<00:02:03.679> points<00:02:04.299> it's<00:02:05.299> a<00:02:05.360> lot

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
to get the extra points it's a lot

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.149 
to get the extra points it's a lot
faster<00:02:05.750> so<00:02:06.319> I'm<00:02:06.500> probably<00:02:06.619> gonna<00:02:06.860> switch<00:02:07.130> it

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
faster so I'm probably gonna switch it

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:11.920 
faster so I'm probably gonna switch it
up<00:02:07.340> here<00:02:09.310> might<00:02:10.310> be<00:02:10.340> a<00:02:10.429> little<00:02:10.610> lot<00:02:11.209> more<00:02:11.390> you

around<00:02:28.069> it's<00:02:28.519> not<00:02:28.670> a<00:02:28.700> good<00:02:28.880> idea

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.890 

oh<00:02:32.530> my<00:02:33.530> goodness<00:02:34.360> that's<00:02:35.360> why<00:02:35.600> it's<00:02:35.750> not<00:02:35.840> a

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
oh my goodness that's why it's not a

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.250 
oh my goodness that's why it's not a
good<00:02:35.960> idea<00:02:36.110> I<00:02:37.450> should<00:02:38.450> probably<00:02:38.510> put<00:02:38.840> a<00:02:38.870> second

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
good idea I should probably put a second

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.690 
good idea I should probably put a second
around<00:02:39.530> this<00:02:39.680> the<00:02:39.830> reason<00:02:39.980> I<00:02:40.130> don't<00:02:40.190> have<00:02:40.430> a

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
around this the reason I don't have a

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.490 
around this the reason I don't have a
secondary<00:02:41.180> on<00:02:41.390> most<00:02:41.630> of<00:02:41.750> my<00:02:41.840> snipers<00:02:42.320> it's

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
secondary on most of my snipers it's

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.930 
secondary on most of my snipers it's
just<00:02:42.710> because<00:02:43.040> I<00:02:43.460> like<00:02:43.850> having<00:02:44.330> a<00:02:44.360> I<00:02:45.790> see<00:02:46.790> your
