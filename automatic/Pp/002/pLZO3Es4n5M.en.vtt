00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:08.480
 Hello everyone, Indar Murtazin and 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:11.030
 let's talk about sports watches and not 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.610
 just for sport fitness healthy 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:17.210
 adidas lifestyle 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:19.670
 my smart wound coach this watch here I am their 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.789
 already got the same as all that was a 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:27.460
 that was what charging dock 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:31.429
 kobelek watch themselves on such a strap 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:34.220
 non-removable strap that is, it is one for all 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:36.170
 rest of his life in general in the us 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.710
 There is nothing wrong silicone strap 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.930
 Cheap enough here so these 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.100
 I will try to show how they look on 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:48.620
 arm is cheap enough 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:54.140
 latch like latch called 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:57.800
 remember guys they can swim 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.870
 they are protected from water and all the time 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.460
 they constantly do not show 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.519
 press a button so that they 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:07.369
 showed the time it is touch fender 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:10.009
 small can be rotated like this if not 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:12.109
 use not something two weeks they 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:14.090
 can work here periodically there 

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:16.219
 once a day several times a day to be 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.460
 press time if more actively there 

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:21.619
 week 5 days charge enough 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.479
 quickly an hour with a little I swam in them 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:26.390
 Now they can look as follows 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:29.719
 way after the beach naive need to be cleaned 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.859
 heap buttons i'm with your permission 

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:37.009
 take off to show the rest 

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:39.560
 then there is a sensor like the one 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:42.109
 mio alpha this technology is exactly the same as it 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.479
 licensed adidas is exactly the same 

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:47.659
 sensor which is real time 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:51.139
 allows you to measure your pulse difference in 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.819
 watch is that this watch is not for running 

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:54.799
 It does not have the training well, that is, 

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:57.619
 run you can watch 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:59.240
 but transfer your information to 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.490
 Any specialized software for 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.889
 training company's mio alpha you 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.139
 you can have it there is no watch 

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:09.770
 work much longer that is 

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:12.200
 weeks at the same time every second 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.930
 I measure your pulse here 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.660
 because the color screen consumes 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.560
 more and on 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.720
 others and of course there is a problem with 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.800
 how it all works but firstly 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.430
 have a stopwatch 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.530
 there is a timer but the most important thing is that you 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.140
 there is a quick start meaning you can 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:35.310
 free training type of workout you 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:38.480
 choose walking running cycling some 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:42.690
 disciplines are not important 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.270
 and start let's start pay 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.940
 attention now 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:50.220
 measures my pulse and measures gps for 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:54.510
 order to work normally but from bullets 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:57.240
 your laser and shine is actually going 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.790
 illumination but if we talk about the pulse here 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:02.160
 everything is clear, it will be quickly found, but 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.890
 He looks for gps on a cold start somewhere 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:08.010
 two three minutes he has no connectivity 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.810
 as such with a smartphone or something 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.030
 like a-gps is not used 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.640
 used full gps 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.070
 as a result if you want with these 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.870
 hours training such as 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.240
 the room most likely you will fail 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.310
 gps will simply not be found after 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.700
 a few minutes you are supposed to 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:29.340
 doing the workout dimension ran 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.420
 clicked again on the start already and you see 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.940
 your training 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:36.150
 here are four gigabytes of internal memory 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:39.450
 via bluetooth you can listen to music then 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:42.120
 have connected to the clock here there is 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.760
 Airplane connection to Wi-Fi and 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.810
 bluetooth vibration loudness and 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:53.010
 similar things plus tips that 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:54.870
 eat from the side let's change 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.530
 dial on some other here 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:01.240
 I guess this is the number two three dashes I want 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:03.740
 there are tips in english 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:06.560
 synchronization with your service profiles 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:10.459
 adidas service instant auch it is enough 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:13.340
 long ago there but those who are engaged 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:17.750
 fitness know about it now let's 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:22.370
 move on to this service and see what 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:25.310
 there is going on here i have a program 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:32.800
 training for the half marathon probably us 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:32.800
 no need now i want cardio training 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.110
 I want to see some workouts 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:47.169
 long mind is not that is 15 minutes 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:52.910
 long warm up what can i do 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:56.000
 workout how looks ready to move 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:59.169
 things like that you see how 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.190
 i can train 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:04.700
 let's go to the main page 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:08.419
 to see what I had 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:11.240
 5 August means free walking 12 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:14.930
 minutes I can see the calorie map 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:17.680
 distance the frequency was but it was going very 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:20.960
 relaxed 76 beats per minute 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:24.289
 4 meters passed for all the time I found 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:27.560
 hour 413 calories two kilometers 2 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:30.560
 training in this kind of thing that is 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:34.150
 what is a network service is cool 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:36.470
 but if you compare for example, boldly alpha 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.900
 what practical value is that in 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:42.770
 real time mode you get 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.250
 data about how you run and about what 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:48.500
 you 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:51.050
 frequency of beats i.e. your pulse is here 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:53.390
 it is possible to configure zones that will be 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:56.090
 blink if you exit the zone and squeak 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:58.400
 long work for during workout 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:01.760
 good to wear every day and hour and you don't 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:03.650
 can rather be silicone too 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:06.199
 strap better made 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:09.020
 different colors are available today 

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:11.449
 and I love the alpha like a lot more 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:13.490
 if you do not want to buy a dial 

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:17.810
 you can buy without a dial there is an option 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:20.419
 this watch is generally very good 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.930
 that is, it turned out well she knew how 

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:23.479
 alpha 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.259
 adidas costs about 15,000 today 

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:27.229
 rubles 

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:29.509
 used to cost more in this aspect 

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:32.210
 I can say that adidas is perfect 

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:35.000
 not applicable and in practice a thing but not enough 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:37.430
 applicable such know fashionable darling 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.470
 toy that is mio alpha in this regard 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:42.139
 copes with its task significantly 

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:45.740
 better workout yes it is an important component 

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:47.690
 important addition but also such knows 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:50.449
 sort of a toy technically this one 

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:52.460
 the thing was not very interesting on 

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:55.190
 This all with you was Albert Razin if 

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:58.699
 suddenly you have my coach smart wounds to you 

00:06:55.190 --> 00:07:01.460
 like write call but in sales 

00:06:58.699 --> 00:07:04.310
 adidas this device failed for 

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:07.160
 last half a year and lower prices for it 

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:09.620
 she is not very well sold some 

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:11.000
 such a sad story of luck 

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.460
 good mood stay with us 

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.240
