00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:23.550
 the game for the puppy is a necessity 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:25.529
 in this way he learns and relates is 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.860
 fundamental that the puppy plays in 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.840
 security under our control 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.390
 already as children dogs must have how 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.920
 reference the owner and not 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.750
 must leave the initiative to 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.600
 puppy responding to your request 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.160
 of play but imitating it ourselves a 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.620
 to play 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.530
 and very important to decide where and 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.490
 when playing preferably 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.510
 outside the house 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:53.360
 the ideal is to have our play 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.090
 puppy with another puppy in this 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.160
 so the forces will be matched and 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.460
 roll and the struggles will not come 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:04.070
 unpleasant effects normally yes 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.080
 they regulate themselves and surely it will be 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.100
 an opportunity to create a playful moment 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.100
 for our puppies 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.490
 we must intervene if the game is played 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:16.610
 heavy to prevent the puppy from becoming 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.040
 hurt or get scared and when it's time 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.770
 to go the puppy must stop 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.530
 play and follow us because we are the 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.369
 his reference point always and in 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.369
 any situation 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.369
 the game with other adult dogs must 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.369
 be managed more carefully 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.509
 it is necessary to identify patients and dogs 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:42.290
 very reliable absolutely under the 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:44.390
 check their owner with us 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.130
 present we can let approach the 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.800
 puppy but we verify that nons 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.570
 adult skull dog patients normally 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.550
 to the dog's annoyed reaction 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.520
 adult match signals of 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.930
 submission by the puppy 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.260
 tranquilizers for the adult dog that 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.030
 he will not attack him to keep him away 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.250
 we never let the puppy come close 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.450
 unknown and wandering dogs for not 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.799
 take the risk of any 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.750
 aggressions 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.790
 but also for a health precaution 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.830
 that we still have to consider at age 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.650
 two months when the program 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.630
 vaccination is still incomplete 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.489
 the advice is therefore to make the 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:23.320
 game as calm as possible for 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.320
 facilitate his socialization
