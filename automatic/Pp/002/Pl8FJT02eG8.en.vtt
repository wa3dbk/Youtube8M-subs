00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
e36 it takes a six millimeter allen

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.510 
e36 it takes a six millimeter allen
wrench<00:01:28.710> so<00:01:29.710> I've<00:01:29.829> got<00:01:30.009> that<00:01:30.250> and<00:01:32.219> you<00:01:33.219> really

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
wrench so I've got that and you really

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.719 
wrench so I've got that and you really
need<00:01:33.759> I<00:01:34.030> mean<00:01:34.960> I've<00:01:35.079> seen<00:01:35.350> people<00:01:35.409> use<00:01:35.979> regular

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:38.550 
need I mean I've seen people use regular
Allen<00:01:37.000> wrenches<00:01:37.299> but<00:01:37.600> they're<00:01:38.409> often

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
Allen wrenches but they're often

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.080 
Allen wrenches but they're often
extremely<00:01:39.250> tight<00:01:39.520> so<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:41.920> helps<00:01:42.340> to<00:01:42.909> have

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
extremely tight so it helps to have

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.609 
extremely tight so it helps to have
something<00:01:43.630> that<00:01:43.780> you<00:01:43.899> can<00:01:44.079> really<00:01:44.490> put<00:01:45.490> down

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
something that you can really put down

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.200 
something that you can really put down
okay<00:01:48.240> not

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
okay not

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.160 
okay not
no<00:01:52.400> usually<00:01:53.400> these<00:01:53.940> are<00:01:54.119> pretty<00:01:54.540> tight<00:01:54.900> on

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
no usually these are pretty tight on

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.120 
no usually these are pretty tight on
here<00:01:55.610> and<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:57.600> can<00:01:57.630> hit<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.440> surface<00:01:58.740> with<00:01:59.100> a

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
here and you can hit the surface with a

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.219 
here and you can hit the surface with a
hammer<00:01:59.400> to<00:01:59.580> break<00:01:59.850> it<00:02:00.150> loose<00:02:00.180> because<00:02:00.900> they

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
hammer to break it loose because they

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.440 
hammer to break it loose because they
kind<00:02:01.470> of<00:02:01.590> rust<00:02:01.830> on<00:02:02.040> here<00:02:02.340> in<00:02:02.460> my<00:02:03.000> case<00:02:03.060> it

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
kind of rust on here in my case it

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.060 
kind of rust on here in my case it
should<00:02:03.630> be<00:02:03.720> pretty<00:02:03.900> easy<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.380> get<00:02:04.500> off<00:02:04.650> because

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
should be pretty easy to get off because

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.090 
should be pretty easy to get off because
I<00:02:05.280> just<00:02:05.310> took<00:02:05.820> them<00:02:06.060> off<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.930> little<00:02:07.560> while<00:02:07.860> ago

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
I just took them off a little while ago

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.080 
I just took them off a little while ago
and<00:02:08.520> I<00:02:08.959> put<00:02:09.959> anti-seize<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:11.190> make<00:02:11.700> sure<00:02:11.910> that

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
and I put anti-seize to make sure that

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.190 
and I put anti-seize to make sure that
they<00:02:12.209> don't<00:02:12.270> freeze<00:02:12.630> on<00:02:12.900> there<00:02:14.690> in<00:02:15.690> order<00:02:15.959> to

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
they don't freeze on there in order to

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.290 
they don't freeze on there in order to
get<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.770> actual<00:02:17.190> disc<00:02:17.700> brake<00:02:17.910> off<00:02:18.090> which

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
get the actual disc brake off which

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.540 
get the actual disc brake off which
you're<00:02:18.480> ready<00:02:18.660> to<00:02:18.870> do<00:02:19.020> at<00:02:19.170> this<00:02:19.319> point<00:02:19.550> you've

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
you're ready to do at this point you've

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.460 
you're ready to do at this point you've
got<00:02:20.819> to<00:02:20.850> make<00:02:21.120> sure<00:02:21.420> that<00:02:21.630> the<00:02:21.780> parking<00:02:22.080> brake

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
got to make sure that the parking brake

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.949 
got to make sure that the parking brake
is<00:02:22.650> also<00:02:22.830> off<00:02:23.340> because<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.300> parking<00:02:24.690> brake

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
is also off because the parking brake

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.380 
is also off because the parking brake
squeezes<00:02:25.860> onto<00:02:26.130> this<00:02:26.310> so<00:02:26.940> I'm<00:02:27.000> going<00:02:27.150> to<00:02:27.239> go

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
squeezes onto this so I'm going to go

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.020 
squeezes onto this so I'm going to go
make<00:02:28.080> sure<00:02:28.140> that<00:02:28.560> my<00:02:28.800> car<00:02:29.459> is<00:02:29.489> thoroughly

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
make sure that my car is thoroughly

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.110 
make sure that my car is thoroughly
blocked<00:02:30.510> so<00:02:30.930> roll<00:02:31.500> anywhere

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
chocks under all the wheels I'm going to

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:41.690 
chocks under all the wheels I'm going to
take<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.320> parking<00:02:37.680> brake<00:02:37.920> off<00:02:38.100> and<00:02:40.459> then<00:02:41.459> pull

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
be honest they usually don't come off

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:58.930 
be honest they usually don't come off
that<00:02:57.750> easily

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
that easily

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
make sure that this disc brake doesn't

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.740 
make sure that this disc brake doesn't

on<00:03:42.659> first<00:03:43.659> and<00:03:43.870> foremost<00:03:43.930> though<00:03:44.790> good<00:03:45.790> idea

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:54.319 

smear<00:03:50.709> some<00:03:51.480> copper<00:03:52.480> into<00:03:52.780> season<00:03:53.290> here

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
smear some copper into season here

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:57.630 
smear some copper into season here
coding<00:03:55.329> it<00:03:55.480> helps<00:03:56.379> prevent<00:03:56.799> it<00:03:57.040> from<00:03:57.069> rusting

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
coding it helps prevent it from rusting

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.690 
coding it helps prevent it from rusting
on<00:03:58.470> so<00:03:59.470> that<00:03:59.799> the<00:03:59.950> next<00:04:00.129> time<00:04:00.250> you<00:04:00.489> have<00:04:00.579> to

on so that the next time you have to

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.229 
on so that the next time you have to
replace<00:04:01.090> your<00:04:01.329> disc<00:04:01.599> rotor<00:04:02.700> or<00:04:03.700> take<00:04:04.090> your
