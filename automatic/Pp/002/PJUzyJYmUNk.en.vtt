00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
three lives you kill somebody you get to

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.300 
three lives you kill somebody you get to
take<00:01:06.300> their<00:01:06.510> bullet<00:01:06.840> but<00:01:07.200> if<00:01:07.530> you<00:01:07.710> fire<00:01:07.979> and

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
take their bullet but if you fire and

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.069 
take their bullet but if you fire and
you<00:01:08.369> miss<00:01:08.610> then<00:01:09.000> you're<00:01:09.149> now<00:01:09.270> without<00:01:09.869> any

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:10.079 
you miss then you're now without any

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:12.020 
you miss then you're now without any
kind<00:01:10.200> of<00:01:10.320> weapon<00:01:10.469> except<00:01:10.829> for<00:01:10.979> melee<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:11.579> it

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
kind of weapon except for melee so it

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.730 
kind of weapon except for melee so it
probably<00:01:12.360> has<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.869> highest<00:01:13.229> level<00:01:13.619> of

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
probably has the highest level of

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.399 
probably has the highest level of
tension<00:01:14.009> just<00:01:14.520> because<00:01:14.939> it's<00:01:15.540> so<00:01:15.780> unforgiving

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
tension just because it's so unforgiving

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.289 
tension just because it's so unforgiving
and<00:01:16.619> I<00:01:16.710> think<00:01:16.890> that<00:01:17.009> caters<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.549> some<00:01:18.149> of<00:01:18.240> the

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
and I think that caters to some of the

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.020 
and I think that caters to some of the
very<00:01:18.479> very<00:01:18.570> hardcore<00:01:19.020> kind<00:01:19.530> of<00:01:19.590> players<00:01:20.030> the

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
very very hardcore kind of players the

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.399
