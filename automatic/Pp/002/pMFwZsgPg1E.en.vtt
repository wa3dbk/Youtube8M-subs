00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.050
 privately by facebook and I help them 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.490
 of the problem that I have 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.380
 it is important that at the moment 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.210
 unzip it save you make sure that 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.790
 all have the same weight and that the 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.740
 last part weigh exactly as here 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.500
 and gets to have password errors 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.580
 crc do not say that the password is 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.690
 incorrect because the password of 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.630
 perfect is what I put the 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.759

 the bases are of the game 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.040
 we just wait for this to end 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.040
 two 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.880
