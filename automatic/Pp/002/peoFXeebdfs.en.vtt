other captured tool systems the biggest

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.240 
other captured tool systems the biggest
difference<00:01:09.330> is<00:01:09.840> its<00:01:10.110> very<00:01:10.380> small<00:01:10.500> footprint

difference is its very small footprint

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.399 
difference is its very small footprint
which<00:01:11.820> allows<00:01:12.150> you<00:01:12.360> better<00:01:12.630> access<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.140> the

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
which allows you better access to the

which allows you better access to the
cutting<00:01:13.590> tool<00:01:14.119> in<00:01:15.119> addition<00:01:15.659> you<00:01:15.990> will<00:01:16.080> notice

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
cutting tool in addition you will notice

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.140 
cutting tool in addition you will notice
how<00:01:16.530> easy<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:17.040> is<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.490> control<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.970> tool

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
how easy it is to control the tool

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.390 
how easy it is to control the tool
that's<00:01:18.930> because<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.590> shape<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:19.979> hollow<00:01:20.130> tool

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
that's because the shape and hollow tool

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.240 
that's because the shape and hollow tool
uses<00:01:20.960> industrial<00:01:21.960> quality<00:01:22.350> ball<00:01:22.860> bearings

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
that let the tool glide smoothly because

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.130 
that let the tool glide smoothly because
