hello guys welcome to another traveler

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.730 
hello guys welcome to another traveler
from<00:00:02.370> Outland<00:00:02.820> video<00:00:03.149> in<00:00:03.750> this<00:00:03.899> video<00:00:04.440> I<00:00:04.470> will

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
from Outland video in this video I will

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.559 
from Outland video in this video I will
show<00:00:04.890> you<00:00:04.920> yet<00:00:05.490> another<00:00:05.520> affliction<00:00:06.270> warlock

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
show you yet another affliction warlock

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.629 
show you yet another affliction warlock
trick<00:00:06.779> and<00:00:07.259> we'll<00:00:07.379> discuss<00:00:07.770> how<00:00:07.799> I<00:00:08.040> saw<00:00:08.340> swap

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
trick and we'll discuss how I saw swap

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.419 
trick and we'll discuss how I saw swap
and<00:00:08.880> which<00:00:09.120> is<00:00:09.360> my<00:00:09.690> opinion<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.170> most

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:10.429 
and which is my opinion the most

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:15.709 
and which is my opinion the most
efficient<00:00:11.429> in<00:00:12.980> the<00:00:13.980> past<00:00:14.429> I<00:00:14.610> use<00:00:14.759> separate<00:00:15.240> key

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
efficient in the past I use separate key

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.019 
efficient in the past I use separate key
binds<00:00:15.929> for<00:00:16.199> solver<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:17.279> initial<00:00:17.609> ability

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
binds for solver and the initial ability

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.929 
binds for solver and the initial ability
that<00:00:18.180> I<00:00:18.210> wanted<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.570> use<00:00:18.720> but<00:00:19.590> like<00:00:19.980> I<00:00:20.340> learned

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
that I wanted to use but like I learned

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.540 
that I wanted to use but like I learned
that<00:00:21.090> you<00:00:21.270> can<00:00:21.449> makrooh<00:00:21.930> it<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.230> to<00:00:22.529> enter<00:00:23.430> the

because<00:00:36.630> you<00:00:36.840> don't<00:00:37.050> have<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.320> press

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
because you don't have to press

because you don't have to press
different<00:00:38.640> key<00:00:38.969> bind<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.360> then<00:00:39.450> switch<00:00:39.690> to

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
different key bind and then switch to

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.049 
different key bind and then switch to
the<00:00:39.899> other<00:00:40.020> two<00:00:40.350> just<00:00:40.530> combine<00:00:41.399> two<00:00:41.640> devices

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
the other two just combine two devices

the other two just combine two devices
in<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.800> boss<00:00:44.010> I<00:00:44.219> didn't<00:00:44.460> had<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.610> saucepan

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
in the boss I didn't had a saucepan

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.440 
in the boss I didn't had a saucepan
macro<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.719> what<00:00:46.079> I<00:00:46.110> had<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.440> do<00:00:46.530> then<00:00:46.710> is<00:00:46.860> like

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
macro and what I had to do then is like

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.569 
macro and what I had to do then is like
swap<00:00:48.450> targets<00:00:48.899> manually<00:00:49.440> target<00:00:50.430> the

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
swap targets manually target the

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.209 
swap targets manually target the
different<00:00:50.700> units<00:00:51.629> even<00:00:52.170> pets<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.680> players<00:00:52.890> so

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
different units even pets and players so

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.930 
different units even pets and players so
good<00:00:53.789> sometimes<00:00:54.090> screw<00:00:54.899> me<00:00:55.050> over<00:00:55.760> with<00:00:56.760> this

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
good sometimes screw me over with this

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.000 
good sometimes screw me over with this
macro<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:57.629> will<00:00:57.840> allow<00:00:58.109> you<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.440> maintain<00:00:58.770> your

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
macro it will allow you to maintain your

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.049 
macro it will allow you to maintain your
current<00:00:59.489> target<00:00:59.670> and<00:01:00.239> so<00:01:00.449> swap<00:01:00.719> way<00:01:00.930> easier

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
current target and so swap way easier

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:05.539 
current target and so swap way easier
now<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.090> tip<00:01:03.449> when<00:01:03.780> using<00:01:03.989> this<00:01:04.260> macro<00:01:04.739> is<00:01:04.949> use

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
now a tip when using this macro is use

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.820 
now a tip when using this macro is use
nameplates<00:01:06.150> it's<00:01:06.450> really<00:01:06.720> important<00:01:07.200> even<00:01:07.619> in

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
nameplates it's really important even in

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.190 
nameplates it's really important even in
there<00:01:07.950> especially<00:01:08.549> arena<00:01:09.030> views<00:01:09.780> many<00:01:09.990> plates

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
there especially arena views many plates

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.969 
there especially arena views many plates
like<00:01:10.530> go<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.369> your<00:01:11.760> interface<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:13.740> go<00:01:13.920> to

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
like go to your interface and you go to

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.210 
like go to your interface and you go to
names<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:15.180> you<00:01:15.450> can<00:01:15.630> just<00:01:15.920> put<00:01:16.920> it<00:01:17.040> on

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
names and you can just put it on

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.770 
names and you can just put it on
stacking<00:01:17.729> name<00:01:18.000> plates<00:01:18.240> don't<00:01:18.479> put<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.720> on

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
stacking name plates don't put it on

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.749 
stacking name plates don't put it on
overlapping<00:01:19.259> or<00:01:19.500> spreading<00:01:19.830> because<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.580> will

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
overlapping or spreading because it will

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.270 
overlapping or spreading because it will
jump<00:01:21.659> around<00:01:21.810> or<00:01:22.290> you<00:01:22.740> won't<00:01:22.830> be<00:01:22.979> able<00:01:23.130> to

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
jump around or you won't be able to

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.940 
jump around or you won't be able to
mouse<00:01:23.580> over<00:01:23.610> other<00:01:24.390> targets<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:25.049> these<00:01:25.170> so

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
mouse over other targets of these so

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.060 
mouse over other targets of these so
stacking<00:01:26.340> is<00:01:26.430> best<00:01:27.320> this<00:01:28.320> clip<00:01:28.619> shows<00:01:28.890> the

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
stacking is best this clip shows the

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:36.370 
stacking is best this clip shows the
Macarena

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.469 

as<00:01:36.950> you<00:01:37.070> can<00:01:37.219> see<00:01:37.490> all<00:01:37.670> three<00:01:37.880> hunters<00:01:38.270> were

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
as you can see all three hunters were

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.770 
as you can see all three hunters were
dotted<00:01:38.689> up<00:01:38.960> without<00:01:39.860> switching<00:01:40.340> targets

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
dotted up without switching targets

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.429 
dotted up without switching targets
really<00:01:43.270> another<00:01:44.270> reflection<00:01:44.570> trick<00:01:45.110> which

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
really another reflection trick which

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:47.289 
really another reflection trick which
can<00:01:45.680> increase<00:01:45.979> your<00:01:46.189> damage<00:01:46.399> by<00:01:46.700> at<00:01:46.759> least<00:01:46.970> 5%

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
can increase your damage by at least 5%

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:50.919 
can increase your damage by at least 5%
when<00:01:48.110> multi<00:01:48.560> dollar<00:01:49.299> it's<00:01:50.299> like<00:01:50.539> when<00:01:50.810> you

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:50.929 
when multi dollar it's like when you

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:52.389 
when multi dollar it's like when you
it's<00:01:50.960> all<00:01:51.200> strapped<00:01:51.439> in<00:01:51.469> here<00:01:51.829> you<00:01:52.189> use<00:01:52.369> a

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
it's all strapped in here you use a

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:55.210 
it's all strapped in here you use a
global<00:01:52.729> exit<00:01:53.390> to<00:01:53.539> the<00:01:53.630> second<00:01:53.990> targets<00:01:54.380> you

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
global exit to the second targets you

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.700 
global exit to the second targets you
will<00:01:55.369> notice<00:01:55.700> that<00:01:55.729> the<00:01:56.240> dots<00:01:56.479> a<00:01:56.960> duration<00:01:57.590> of

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
will notice that the dots a duration of

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.069 
will notice that the dots a duration of
the<00:01:57.799> second<00:01:58.159> target<00:01:58.340> is<00:01:58.729> one<00:01:59.299> global<00:01:59.720> longer

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 
the second target is one global longer

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:02.710 
the second target is one global longer
than<00:02:00.500> the<00:02:00.679> first<00:02:00.920> target<00:02:01.670> so<00:02:02.270> it's<00:02:02.450> better<00:02:02.630> to

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
than the first target so it's better to

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.410 
than the first target so it's better to
solve<00:02:03.020> swap<00:02:03.289> in<00:02:03.530> heel<00:02:04.069> again<00:02:04.399> but<00:02:05.030> from<00:02:05.299> the

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
solve swap in heel again but from the

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.870 
solve swap in heel again but from the
second<00:02:05.780> target<00:02:06.110> to<00:02:06.500> the<00:02:06.530> third<00:02:06.860> one<00:02:07.189> and<00:02:07.729> then

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
second target to the third one and then

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
I've swapped to two targets so the

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.610 
I've swapped to two targets so the
difference<00:02:17.510> between<00:02:17.599> the<00:02:18.019> first<00:02:18.260> and<00:02:18.440> the

difference between the first and the
third<00:02:18.709> one<00:02:19.160> is<00:02:19.190> two<00:02:20.030> Global's<00:02:20.450> which<00:02:20.599> can<00:02:20.810> be

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
third one is two Global's which can be

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.680 
third one is two Global's which can be
really<00:02:21.170> huge<00:02:21.380> in<00:02:21.530> lower<00:02:22.239> thanks<00:02:23.239> for<00:02:23.360> watching
