00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:23.610
 biomedical technology comes from a 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:26.840
 very concrete need and it is the need 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:29.600
 to give an effective answer to the problems 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:33.120
 biomedical technology 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:36.090
 raised complexity that demands that 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.850
 work together specialists of 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.790
 multiple disciplines from medicine 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.110
 physical and different chemical biology 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.110
 engineering specialties 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.770
 this is the neuroscience laboratory 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.990
 computational cognitive in this 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.640
 laboratory we are dedicated to the study of 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:05.199
 neurological diseases such as 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.210
 Alzheimer's disease stroke 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.070
 depression and through the team the 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.750
 magnetoencephalography what we measure are 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.250
 is the brain activity the 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.140
 brain oscillations and how it 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.450
 synchronize the different regions 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.220
 each other and exchange information 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.110
 these exchanges of information we 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.490
 allow to study the connectome 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.100
 human brain connected to level 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.600
 functional and for this we need a 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.720
 interdisciplinary study 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.200
 mathematical physical psychologists 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.200
 engineers and doctors 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.710
 at the biomedical technology center 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.290
 we develop stimulation equipment 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.140
 magnetic transcranial in this case of 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.960
 under field for some illness like 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.700
 is the case of fibromyalgia we have 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.409
 good results we have been approved 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.899
 for medication management and 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:54.009
 health products to be able 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.680
 market an appliance and here we have 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:58.740
 developed not only let's say the 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.119
 application but also electronics 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.100
 reactive of these devices we have done 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.740
 a clinical trial and we have verified that 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.960
 effectively applying a very field 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:12.300
 small estimate hobby we get 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.300
 reversing symptoms in large part 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.879
 and 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.569
 The main objective of our 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.250
 laboratory is the study of the micro 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.910
 cerebral court organization 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.069
 normal and in pathological conditions 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.230
 using new tools very 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:40.510
 sophisticated for the analysis both 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.440
 ultra structural like microscopy 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:47.260
 optics we want to know the design 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:51.239
 of how the brain is structured and 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.239
 how it connects to say the symptom 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:04.340
 to address is multidisciplinarity 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:07.069
 It is essential to meet the 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.200
 no objective scientific center 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:11.450
 we could only count on the 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.860
 resources of researchers from the 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.200
 polytechnic university analyzing the 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.180
 center is a 100% university center 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.040
 polytechnic we had to convince by 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.840
 so to other researchers 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.940
 institutions so that your work of 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.410
 the research done in this center is 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.540
 we have achieved with a formula that I 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.950
 I think it's very powerful very stable and already 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.780
 it is proving to be very 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.840
 beneficial to create 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:35.720
 mixed laboratories with the council with 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.430
 the unit or of complutense of madrid with 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.099
 the need king Juan Carlos with 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.410
 hospitals and associations with both 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:46.780
 very diverse hospitals in the area in the 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.780
 that we are working as with companies 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.730
 two 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.909
 i 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.990
 this is the cell culture unit 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.700
 of ctv here in this room what we do 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.170
 is to test all the particles 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.050
 nanoparticles and all materials 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:13.209
 that are synthesized in the center by the 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:16.410
 rest of groups and what we are 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:19.390
 doing now is trying 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:21.220
 use laser to make hyperthermia 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:23.760
 optics in cell elimination 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.760
 tumor 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:34.210
 our research group belongs 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.120
 to the unit of cellular models and 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.889
 FTV animals have basically 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.660
 several research lines of the 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:43.810
 which the most active at this moment is 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:46.000
 the development of preclinical models of 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.090
 animals the search for therapies 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.470
 effective in the treatment of stroke 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.240
 human we basically employ two 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.699
 different strategies stem cells 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.620
 mesenchymal encapsulated in matrices 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:05:00.910
 of fibrin in collaboration with the group 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:02.530
 of gustavo line of the center and the other the 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.449
 another type of therapeutic approach is 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.490
 the use of pharmacology form for 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:09.300
 reduce the penumbra area in the 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.300
 cerebrovascular accident 

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:21.849
 in the materials laboratory 

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:23.799
 biological work with materials 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:25.509
 produced by living beings with the 

00:05:23.799 --> 00:05:27.669
 order to apply its excellent 

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:29.979
 properties to the regeneration of tissues 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:31.809
 and other applications in bioengineering in 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:34.329
 we work with the materials 

00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:36.069
 produced by spiders that have the 

00:05:34.329 --> 00:05:38.109
 silk has some properties 

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:39.999
 mechanical as physical chemistries and about 

00:05:38.109 --> 00:05:42.639
 all a huge biological compatibility 

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:45.339
 which makes them optimal for regeneration 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:47.639
 of neural tissues cartilage bones 

00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:47.639
 etc 

00:05:55.789 --> 00:06:02.699
 finally the goal of this center 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:05.490
 biomedical technology is the contribution of 

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:07.169
 scientific and technological solutions to 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:09.870
 some of the big problems 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:14.699
 biomedical that exist at this moment 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:16.979
 with the desire that this flow of 

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:20.610
 potential benefits in society are 

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:22.710
 was compensated by a flow in the direction 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:25.169
 contrary to society towards its 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:27.800
 researchers who dedicate their lives to 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:27.800
 this work 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:37.500
