00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
frames per second so if you want to be

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.680 
frames per second so if you want to be
able<00:01:41.890> to<00:01:41.950> get<00:01:42.130> 60<00:01:42.580> frames<00:01:42.610> you've<00:01:43.240> got<00:01:43.450> to<00:01:43.570> drop

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
able to get 60 frames you've got to drop

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.300 
able to get 60 frames you've got to drop
your<00:01:43.750> display<00:01:44.170> down<00:01:44.350> so<00:01:44.619> make<00:01:44.979> sure<00:01:45.009> you<00:01:45.220> go

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
your display down so make sure you go

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.100

into<00:01:45.520> your<00:01:45.610> Xbox<00:01:46.000> settings<00:01:46.390> I<00:01:46.570> assume<00:01:46.960> this

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
into your Xbox settings I assume this

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.900 
into your Xbox settings I assume this
would<00:01:47.229> be<00:01:47.350> the<00:01:47.470> same<00:01:47.650> for<00:01:47.880> PlayStation<00:01:48.880> 3

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:48.910

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
drop your resolution down to 720p ignore
