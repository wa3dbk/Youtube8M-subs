the other I like to think about pressing

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.750 
the other I like to think about pressing
forward<00:00:24.570> with<00:00:24.750> my<00:00:25.230> left<00:00:25.529> hip<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:26.400> keep<00:00:26.609> the

forward with my left hip to keep the

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.450 
forward with my left hip to keep the
hoop<00:00:26.939> go<00:00:27.260> so<00:00:28.260> starting<00:00:29.070> with<00:00:29.189> it<00:00:29.340> on<00:00:29.429> your

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.950 
hoop go so starting with it on your
waist<00:00:31.399> now<00:00:32.399> if<00:00:32.790> this<00:00:32.969> is<00:00:33.180> really<00:00:33.360> hard<00:00:33.690> for<00:00:33.870> you

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
waist now if this is really hard for you

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.950 
waist now if this is really hard for you
and<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.200> hoop<00:00:34.380> starts<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:34.890> fall<00:00:35.130> right<00:00:35.460> away

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960

the<00:00:36.960> technique<00:00:37.410> for<00:00:37.590> bringing<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.100> back<00:00:38.280> up<00:00:38.340> is

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
the technique for bringing it back up is

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.389 
the technique for bringing it back up is
that<00:00:39.420> you<00:00:39.570> bend<00:00:39.930> your<00:00:40.290> knees<00:00:40.500> so<00:00:40.920> your<00:00:41.070> spine

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
that you bend your knees so your spine

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.670 
that you bend your knees so your spine
is<00:00:41.579> nice<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:41.850> straight<00:00:42.180> straight<00:00:42.930> down<00:00:43.290> into

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
is nice and straight straight down into

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.889 
is nice and straight straight down into
the<00:00:43.860> hoop<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.340> then<00:00:44.820> start<00:00:45.210> pushing<00:00:45.600> really

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
the hoop and then start pushing really

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.799 
the hoop and then start pushing really
hard<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.649> quickly<00:00:47.010> with<00:00:47.340> that<00:00:47.520> left<00:00:47.879> hip<00:00:48.210> to

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
hard and quickly with that left hip to

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.360 
hard and quickly with that left hip to
get<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.110> hoop<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.320> come<00:00:49.710> back<00:00:49.920> up<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.309> then

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
get the hoop to come back up and then

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.150 
get the hoop to come back up and then
stand<00:00:50.910> back<00:00:51.120> up<00:00:51.149> so<00:00:52.050> I'll<00:00:52.230> demonstrate<00:00:52.590> that

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
stand back up so I'll demonstrate that

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.889 
stand back up so I'll demonstrate that
now<00:00:53.460> you're<00:00:54.390> around<00:00:55.199> your<00:00:55.530> waist<00:00:56.539> hoop<00:00:57.539> starts

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
now you're around your waist hoop starts

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.160 
now you're around your waist hoop starts
to<00:00:58.079> fall<00:00:58.379> bend<00:00:58.859> down<00:00:59.039> hip<00:00:59.609> hip<00:01:00.030> hip<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.989> bring

bending over hip hip hip and if I were
to<00:01:13.290> say<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:13.770> were<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.250> bend<00:01:14.430> over<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:15.119> try<00:01:15.659> and

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
to say I were to bend over to try and

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.630 
to say I were to bend over to try and
get<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:15.960> hoop<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.140> come<00:01:16.439> back<00:01:16.590> up<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.100> this

get the hoop to come back up and this

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.090 
get the hoop to come back up and this
would<00:01:17.909> start<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.270> happen<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.930> I've<00:01:19.500> totally

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
would start to happen and I've totally

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.810 
would start to happen and I've totally
lost<00:01:20.520> my<00:01:20.909> horizontal<00:01:21.560> waist<00:01:22.560> hooping<00:01:22.820> one

lost my horizontal waist hooping one

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.820 
lost my horizontal waist hooping one
thing<00:01:24.090> also<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.630> consider<00:01:25.049> if<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.619> hoop

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
thing also to consider if the hoop

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.560 
thing also to consider if the hoop
continues<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.670> fall<00:01:26.909> even<00:01:26.939> though<00:01:27.299> you're

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
continues to fall even though you're

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.690 
continues to fall even though you're
trying<00:01:27.750> these<00:01:28.110> techniques<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:28.920> practicing<00:01:29.549> a

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
trying these techniques and practicing a

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.999 
trying these techniques and practicing a
lot<00:01:29.880> is<00:01:30.420> that<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:30.630> may<00:01:30.960> be<00:01:30.990> using<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.650> hoop<00:01:31.829> that

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
lot is that you may be using a hoop that

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.870 
lot is that you may be using a hoop that
is<00:01:32.130> too<00:01:32.369> small<00:01:32.909> or<00:01:33.329> too<00:01:33.360> light<00:01:33.930> for<00:01:34.320> you<00:01:34.880> the

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
is too small or too light for you the

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.580 
is too small or too light for you the
diameter<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.570> your<00:01:36.600> hoop<00:01:36.900> for<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.170> beginner

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
diameter of your hoop for a beginner

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.670 
diameter of your hoop for a beginner
should<00:01:38.220> be<00:01:38.369> at<00:01:38.640> least<00:01:38.939> or<00:01:39.299> almost<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:40.079> the

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
should be at least or almost to the

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.140 
should be at least or almost to the
height<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:41.040> your<00:01:41.130> belly<00:01:41.369> button<00:01:41.729> from<00:01:41.909> the

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
height of your belly button from the

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.539 
height of your belly button from the
floor<00:01:42.479> this<00:01:43.020> is<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.200> very<00:01:43.530> good<00:01:43.829> size<00:01:44.130> for

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
floor this is a very good size for

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.120 
floor this is a very good size for
starting<00:01:45.060> I<00:01:45.210> also<00:01:45.750> suggest<00:01:46.500> using<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.920> hoop

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
starting I also suggest using a hoop

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.429 
starting I also suggest using a hoop
that<00:01:47.310> is<00:01:47.460> has<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.790> nice<00:01:48.090> weight<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.659> no

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
that is has a nice weight to it no

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.670 
that is has a nice weight to it no
heavier<00:01:49.890> than<00:01:50.159> 2<00:01:50.399> pounds<00:01:50.720> but<00:01:51.720> around<00:01:52.439> the

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
heavier than 2 pounds but around the

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.980 
heavier than 2 pounds but around the
one-pound<00:01:53.250> range<00:01:53.670> is<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:53.939> good<00:01:54.210> starting

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
one-pound range is a good starting

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.859 
one-pound range is a good starting
weight<00:01:55.430> so<00:01:56.430> if<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:56.850> notice<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.240> your<00:01:57.689> hoop

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
weight so if you notice that your hoop

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.760 
weight so if you notice that your hoop
is<00:01:58.049> very<00:01:58.350> light<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:58.979> very<00:01:59.430> small<00:01:59.909> that<00:02:00.689> is

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
is very light and very small that is

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.560 
is very light and very small that is
probably<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:02.100> main<00:02:02.670> problem<00:02:03.210> that<00:02:03.240> you're

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
probably the main problem that you're

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.190 
probably the main problem that you're
