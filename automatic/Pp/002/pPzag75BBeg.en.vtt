00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
up the monster levels in Diablo because

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.160 
up the monster levels in Diablo because
the<00:01:58.829> health<00:01:59.219> pool<00:01:59.579> of<00:01:59.909> these<00:02:00.119> monsters<00:02:00.810> just

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
the health pool of these monsters just

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.600 
the health pool of these monsters just
it<00:02:01.920> explodes<00:02:02.700> I<00:02:03.090> mean<00:02:03.869> my<00:02:03.990> buddy<00:02:04.229> went<00:02:04.439> into<00:02:04.950> we

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
it explodes I mean my buddy went into we

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.429 
it explodes I mean my buddy went into we
would<00:02:05.759> did<00:02:05.939> monster<00:02:06.299> level<00:02:06.540> 3<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:06.990> we<00:02:07.170> went<00:02:07.350> to

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
would did monster level 3 and we went to

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.729 
would did monster level 3 and we went to
act<00:02:07.590> 1<00:02:08.250> because<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.780> second<00:02:10.259> change<00:02:10.470> the

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
act 1 because the second change the

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.530 
act 1 because the second change the
second<00:02:11.039> major<00:02:11.340> change<00:02:11.849> that<00:02:12.090> they<00:02:12.180> made<00:02:12.330> one

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
second major change that they made one

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.950 
second major change that they made one
point

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
point

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.340 
point
five<00:02:13.080> is<00:02:13.350> they<00:02:13.680> made<00:02:13.830> it<00:02:13.950> so<00:02:14.040> every<00:02:14.520> act<00:02:14.820> in

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
five is they made it so every act in

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.260 
five is they made it so every act in
Inferno<00:02:16.350> drops<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:17.040> exact<00:02:17.520> same<00:02:17.760> loose<00:02:18.060> so

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
Inferno drops the exact same loose so

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.880 
Inferno drops the exact same loose so
there's<00:02:18.450> literally<00:02:18.780> no<00:02:19.200> benefit<00:02:19.710> to<00:02:19.740> doing

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
there's literally no benefit to doing

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.790 
there's literally no benefit to doing
act<00:02:20.310> for<00:02:20.850> which<00:02:21.120> is<00:02:21.720> harder<00:02:22.110> than<00:02:22.590> there<00:02:22.770> is

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
act for which is harder than there is

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.830 
act for which is harder than there is
doing<00:02:23.190> act<00:02:23.340> 1<00:02:23.610> which<00:02:23.970> is<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.270> easiest<00:02:24.480> on

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
doing act 1 which is the easiest on

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.530 
doing act 1 which is the easiest on
inferno<00:02:25.200> so<00:02:25.920> you<00:02:26.910> know<00:02:27.000> buddy<00:02:27.180> we're<00:02:27.360> doing

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
inferno so you know buddy we're doing
