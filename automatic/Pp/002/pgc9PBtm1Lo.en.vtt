00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:01.910 
being the sweetener one of those happens
to<00:02:00.869> be<00:02:00.959> true<00:02:01.109> via<00:02:01.349> and<00:02:01.499> the<00:02:01.590> other<00:02:01.709> ones

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
to be true via and the other ones

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.489 
to be true via and the other ones
happens<00:02:02.310> happens<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.849> be<00:02:02.969> named<00:02:03.179> pure<00:02:03.479> via<00:02:03.689> so

00:02:04.489 --> 00:02:04.499 
happens happens to be named pure via so

Anatol or motel those are basically

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.180 
Anatol or motel those are basically
fifty<00:04:35.210> to<00:04:35.480> seventy-five<00:04:35.990> percent<00:04:36.440> the

fifty to seventy-five percent the
digestibility<00:04:38.120> of<00:04:38.150> sugars<00:04:38.570> so<00:04:38.720> therefore<00:04:39.140> so

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
digestibility of sugars so therefore so

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.830 
digestibility of sugars so therefore so
basically<00:04:40.190> one<00:04:40.490> serving<00:04:40.910> of<00:04:41.000> those<00:04:41.240> would

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
basically one serving of those would

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.160 
basically one serving of those would
equal<00:04:42.260> about<00:04:42.790> 50%<00:04:43.790> of<00:04:43.970> the<00:04:44.270> digestibility<00:04:44.900> or

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.170 
equal about 50% of the digestibility or

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:51.870 
equal about 50% of the digestibility or
glucose<00:04:45.800> that<00:04:46.040> sugar<00:04:46.340> would<00:04:46.580> have

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.980 

one<00:04:52.880> of<00:04:52.970> the<00:04:53.060> other<00:04:53.240> problems<00:04:53.720> that<00:04:53.750> these

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
one of the other problems that these

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.380 
one of the other problems that these
sugar<00:04:54.290> alcohols<00:04:54.800> specifically<00:04:55.610> Molotov<00:04:56.120> and

sugar alcohols specifically Molotov and

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:00.100 
sugar alcohols specifically Molotov and
mannitol<00:04:57.110> is<00:04:57.380> that<00:04:58.250> because<00:04:59.150> they're<00:04:59.360> by<00:04:59.510> the

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
mannitol is that because they're by the

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.830 
mannitol is that because they're by the

they're only 50% digestible by the

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:04.640 
bodies one of the things that they

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.730

are<00:05:24.620> some<00:05:25.010> of<00:05:25.070> the<00:05:25.130> more<00:05:25.310> negative<00:05:25.730> ones<00:05:25.910> let's

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:26.540 
are some of the more negative ones let's

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:27.880 
are some of the more negative ones let's
deal<00:05:26.750> with<00:05:26.780> some<00:05:26.900> of<00:05:27.080> the<00:05:27.140> other<00:05:27.290> ones<00:05:27.500> well

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:27.890 
deal with some of the other ones well

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:29.740 
deal with some of the other ones well
some<00:05:28.820> of<00:05:28.850> the<00:05:28.940> other<00:05:29.120> new<00:05:29.360> ones<00:05:29.510> that<00:05:29.660> are

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
some of the other new ones that are

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:31.900 
some of the other new ones that are
coming<00:05:29.870> out<00:05:30.200> is<00:05:30.380> a<00:05:30.800> Gavi<00:05:31.040> nectar<00:05:31.670> and

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:31.910 
coming out is a Gavi nectar and

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:34.360 
coming out is a Gavi nectar and
basically<00:05:32.810> that<00:05:32.930> comes<00:05:33.530> from<00:05:33.770> the<00:05:33.890> blue<00:05:34.070> agave

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
basically that comes from the blue agave

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.280 
basically that comes from the blue agave
plant<00:05:34.790> the<00:05:34.970> same<00:05:35.180> stuff<00:05:35.420> that<00:05:35.450> makes<00:05:35.750> Aquila

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:36.290 
plant the same stuff that makes Aquila

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:39.850 
plant the same stuff that makes Aquila
and<00:05:36.790> they<00:05:37.930> reduce<00:05:38.930> that<00:05:39.110> down<00:05:39.320> they<00:05:39.500> pulp<00:05:39.710> the

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:39.860 
and they reduce that down they pulp the

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.180 
and they reduce that down they pulp the
inside<00:05:40.310> out<00:05:40.550> and<00:05:41.350> make<00:05:42.350> a<00:05:42.380> sweetener<00:05:42.920> out<00:05:43.040> of

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190 
inside out and make a sweetener out of

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.460 
inside out and make a sweetener out of
it<00:05:43.280> well<00:05:43.490> one<00:05:43.730> of<00:05:43.880> the<00:05:44.030> they<00:05:44.870> like<00:05:45.050> to<00:05:45.170> promote

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:45.470 
it well one of the they like to promote

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:47.710 
it well one of the they like to promote
that<00:05:45.680> it's<00:05:45.830> really<00:05:46.070> low<00:05:46.310> glycemic<00:05:46.970> all<00:05:47.630> right

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:47.720 
that it's really low glycemic all right

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.330 
that it's really low glycemic all right
because<00:05:47.840> it's<00:05:48.140> all<00:05:48.320> basically<00:05:48.770> fructose

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:49.340 
because it's all basically fructose

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.970 
because it's all basically fructose
unfortunately<00:05:50.270> fructose<00:05:50.690> while<00:05:51.290> being<00:05:51.620> very

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:51.980 
unfortunately fructose while being very

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:55.120

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.130 
low on the glycemic index it's about 25

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:58.450 
low on the glycemic index it's about 25

where normal table sugar is 50 however

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.330 
where normal table sugar is 50 however
is<00:05:58.700> because<00:05:59.390> it<00:05:59.690> requires<00:05:59.870> to<00:06:00.380> be<00:06:00.410> digested<00:06:00.800> by

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:01.340 
is because it requires to be digested by

and then they combine them with regular

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.090 
and then they combine them with regular
sugar<00:07:00.950> to<00:07:01.640> potentially<00:07:02.330> make<00:07:02.420> them<00:07:02.630> easy

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:03.100 
sugar to potentially make them easy

for baking some crystals happens to

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:09.170 
for baking some crystals happens to
include<00:07:05.620> regular<00:07:06.610> cane<00:07:07.240> sugar<00:07:07.630> with<00:07:08.290> stevia

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:09.180 
include regular cane sugar with stevia

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:11.220 
include regular cane sugar with stevia
Splenda<00:07:10.180> for<00:07:10.360> baking<00:07:10.720> or<00:07:10.870> brown<00:07:11.200> sugar

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:11.230 
Splenda for baking or brown sugar

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:15.510 
Splenda for baking or brown sugar
Splenda<00:07:12.130> it<00:07:12.600> combines<00:07:13.600> regular<00:07:14.530> Splenda<00:07:15.010> with

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:15.520 
Splenda it combines regular Splenda with

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:19.200 
Splenda it combines regular Splenda with
their<00:07:16.270> full<00:07:17.170> cane<00:07:17.470> sugar<00:07:18.100> extract<00:07:18.820> so

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:19.210 
their full cane sugar extract so

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:23.190 
their full cane sugar extract so
basically<00:07:20.050> it's<00:07:20.350> combining<00:07:22.200> artificial

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:23.200 
basically it's combining artificial

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.660 
basically it's combining artificial
sweetener<00:07:23.530> with<00:07:23.770> the<00:07:23.890> real<00:07:24.040> sweetener<00:07:24.490> to

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:24.670 
sweetener with the real sweetener to

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:26.070 
sweetener with the real sweetener to
hopefully<00:07:25.030> get<00:07:25.210> a<00:07:25.270> better<00:07:25.510> product

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:26.080 
hopefully get a better product

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.200 
hopefully get a better product
unfortunately<00:07:26.860> what<00:07:26.950> it<00:07:27.070> does<00:07:27.340> is<00:07:27.700> simply

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:28.210 
unfortunately what it does is simply

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:31.020 
unfortunately what it does is simply
just<00:07:28.420> add<00:07:28.630> sugar<00:07:29.110> back<00:07:29.350> into<00:07:29.650> your<00:07:29.740> diet<00:07:30.000> so<00:07:31.000> I

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:31.030 
just add sugar back into your diet so I

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:31.950 
just add sugar back into your diet so I
hope<00:07:31.240> this<00:07:31.420> helps

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:31.960 
hope this helps

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.720 
hope this helps

I hope this delineates some of the
