Vegeta<00:02:01.649> said<00:02:01.950> next<00:02:02.219> time<00:02:02.369> I'm<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:03.149> one

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
Vegeta said next time I'm the one

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.249 
Vegeta said next time I'm the one
becoming<00:02:03.750> a<00:02:03.810> god

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
becoming a god

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.429 
becoming a god
so<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:05.250> awful<00:02:05.700> shattering<00:02:06.390> that<00:02:06.689> Vegeta

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
so the awful shattering that Vegeta

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.960 
so the awful shattering that Vegeta
might<00:02:07.649> become<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:08.069> Super<00:02:08.459> Saiyan<00:02:08.489> gone

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
might become a Super Saiyan gone

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.970 
might become a Super Saiyan gone
that<00:02:10.720> would<00:02:10.869> be<00:02:10.990> an<00:02:11.050> interesting<00:02:11.560> sight<00:02:11.830> to

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
that would be an interesting sight to

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.570 
that would be an interesting sight to
see<00:02:12.420> but<00:02:13.420> you<00:02:13.600> know<00:02:13.750> I<00:02:14.020> have<00:02:14.890> a<00:02:14.920> little<00:02:15.130> theory

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
see but you know I have a little theory

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.340 
see but you know I have a little theory
on<00:02:16.120> what's<00:02:16.420> going<00:02:16.630> to<00:02:16.660> happen<00:02:16.930> in<00:02:17.020> the<00:02:17.110> next

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
on what's going to happen in the next

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.720 
on what's going to happen in the next
movie<00:02:17.470> it<00:02:17.800> might<00:02:18.070> be<00:02:18.220> Super<00:02:18.490> Saiyan<00:02:18.670> God

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
movie it might be Super Saiyan God

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.280 
movie it might be Super Saiyan God
Vegeta<00:02:19.150> but<00:02:19.270> that's<00:02:19.390> not<00:02:19.570> theory<00:02:19.870> I'm<00:02:20.020> talking

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
Vegeta but that's not theory I'm talking

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.720 
Vegeta but that's not theory I'm talking
about<00:02:20.440> I'm<00:02:20.590> talking<00:02:20.620> about<00:02:20.890> the<00:02:21.100> worst<00:02:21.340> wish

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
about I'm talking about the worst wish

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.430 
about I'm talking about the worst wish
possible<00:02:22.270> and<00:02:22.660> I<00:02:22.720> probably<00:02:23.050> stated<00:02:23.320> this

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
possible and I probably stated this

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.680 
possible and I probably stated this
boring<00:02:23.860> livestreams<00:02:24.460> I<00:02:24.730> can't<00:02:25.300> recall<00:02:25.540> if

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
boring livestreams I can't recall if

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.690 
boring livestreams I can't recall if
I've<00:02:25.810> stated<00:02:26.050> this<00:02:26.290> in<00:02:26.650> videos<00:02:27.160> but<00:02:27.400> holy<00:02:27.580> shit

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
I've stated this in videos but holy shit

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.200 
I've stated this in videos but holy shit
Super<00:02:28.090> Saiyan<00:02:28.300> God<00:02:28.330> red<00:02:28.720> hair<00:02:28.900> Vegeta<00:02:29.260> has

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
Super Saiyan God red hair Vegeta has

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:35.430 
Super Saiyan God red hair Vegeta has
destroyed<00:02:31.260> blue<00:02:32.260> haired<00:02:33.330> to<00:02:34.330> such<00:02:34.780> an<00:02:34.960> extent

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
destroyed blue haired to such an extent

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.600 
destroyed blue haired to such an extent
which<00:02:35.620> is<00:02:35.830> fucking<00:02:36.430> incredible<00:02:38.310> yes<00:02:39.310> he<00:02:39.460> is

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
which is fucking incredible yes he is

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.120 
which is fucking incredible yes he is
but<00:02:40.150> basically<00:02:40.240> my<00:02:40.600> theory<00:02:41.020> is<00:02:41.200> I'm<00:02:41.920> just

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
but basically my theory is I'm just

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.440 
but basically my theory is I'm just
gonna<00:02:42.220> put<00:02:42.430> fight<00:02:42.670> again<00:02:42.910> they're<00:02:43.090> gonna<00:02:43.209> kill

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
gonna put fight again they're gonna kill

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.780 
gonna put fight again they're gonna kill
each<00:02:43.480> other<00:02:43.720> in<00:02:43.870> a<00:02:43.959> second<00:02:44.260> uh<00:02:44.860> fast<00:02:45.520> forward

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
each other in a second uh fast forward

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.090 
each other in a second uh fast forward
it<00:02:45.910> all<00:02:46.240> right<00:02:46.420> so<00:02:46.720> round<00:02:47.080> two<00:02:47.320> see<00:02:47.800> who's<00:02:47.980> the

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
it all right so round two see who's the

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.890 
it all right so round two see who's the
victor<00:02:48.370> this<00:02:48.520> time<00:02:48.760> if<00:02:49.270> it's<00:02:49.420> red<00:02:49.570> haired<00:02:49.780> he

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
victor this time if it's red haired he

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.960 
victor this time if it's red haired he
wins<00:02:50.170> if<00:02:50.380> it's<00:02:50.500> blue<00:02:50.650> haired<00:02:50.860> well<00:02:51.070> you<00:02:51.760> got<00:02:51.850> to

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
wins if it's blue haired well you got to

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.490 
wins if it's blue haired well you got to
do<00:02:52.030> another<00:02:52.209> round<00:02:52.390> but<00:02:52.810> basically<00:02:53.080> my<00:02:53.230> theory

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
do another round but basically my theory

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.710 
do another round but basically my theory
is<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:53.860> worst<00:02:54.100> wish<00:02:54.430> possible<00:02:54.970> that<00:02:55.390> Goku

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
is the worst wish possible that Goku

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.910 
is the worst wish possible that Goku
could<00:02:55.900> make<00:02:56.050> is<00:02:56.560> that<00:02:57.100> he<00:02:57.310> as<00:02:57.600> Shenron<00:02:58.600> to<00:02:59.440> open

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
could make is that he as Shenron to open

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.460 
could make is that he as Shenron to open
the<00:03:00.070> gate<00:03:00.340> of<00:03:00.730> the<00:03:01.000> other<00:03:01.120> universes<00:03:01.750> now<00:03:01.990> what

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
the gate of the other universes now what

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.750 
the gate of the other universes now what
the<00:03:02.709> hell<00:03:02.950> do<00:03:03.160> I<00:03:03.190> mean<00:03:03.430> by<00:03:03.459> gay

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
the hell do I mean by gay

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.910 
the hell do I mean by gay

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
this ain't no formal alchemists bullshit

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.940 
this ain't no formal alchemists bullshit

is to open the other gate to the other
universes<00:03:33.340> so<00:03:33.700> they<00:03:33.880> could<00:03:34.060> fight<00:03:34.239> it<00:03:34.390> off

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600

fight<00:03:35.440> against<00:03:35.980> the<00:03:36.070> other<00:03:36.280> gods<00:03:36.670> and<00:03:37.380> um<00:03:38.850> see

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:57.449 
struggle even though he's stronger than
me<00:03:52.049> you<00:03:53.049> know<00:03:53.200> but<00:03:54.040> um<00:03:55.350> who<00:03:56.350> knows<00:03:56.590> but<00:03:57.250> that's

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
me you know but um who knows but that's

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.759 
me you know but um who knows but that's
my<00:03:57.670> theory<00:03:57.910> i<00:03:58.030> I<00:03:58.209> think<00:03:58.630> that<00:03:58.780> Goku<00:03:59.200> is<00:03:59.380> really

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
my theory i I think that Goku is really

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:05.430 
my theory i I think that Goku is really
looking<00:04:00.670> for<00:04:00.970> a<00:04:01.000> fight<00:04:01.420> and<00:04:03.570> and<00:04:04.570> eventually

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
looking for a fight and and eventually

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.690 
looking for a fight and and eventually
just<00:04:05.650> like<00:04:05.769> you<00:04:05.950> know<00:04:06.040> mates<00:04:06.250> that<00:04:06.430> wish<00:04:06.670> to

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
just like you know mates that wish to

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.820 
just like you know mates that wish to
open<00:04:06.970> up<00:04:07.180> the<00:04:07.269> other<00:04:07.390> universes<00:04:08.380> so<00:04:08.500> then<00:04:08.650> he

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
open up the other universes so then he

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:10.289 
open up the other universes so then he
can<00:04:09.010> travel<00:04:09.250> through<00:04:09.640> them<00:04:09.790> and<00:04:09.910> find<00:04:10.090> off

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
can travel through them and find off

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:11.970 
can travel through them and find off
against<00:04:10.600> the<00:04:10.780> gods<00:04:10.989> and<00:04:11.230> the<00:04:11.320> other<00:04:11.440> gods<00:04:11.680> like

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
against the gods and the other gods like

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.220 
against the gods and the other gods like
what<00:04:12.100> the<00:04:12.220> fuck<00:04:12.489> and<00:04:12.730> maybe<00:04:13.510> perhaps<00:04:13.840> if

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
what the fuck and maybe perhaps if

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:15.960 
what the fuck and maybe perhaps if
that's<00:04:14.440> the<00:04:14.650> case<00:04:14.799> since<00:04:15.160> it<00:04:15.370> is<00:04:15.489> a<00:04:15.519> parallel

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
that's the case since it is a parallel

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:16.409 
that's the case since it is a parallel
universe

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
universe

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.130

maybe<00:04:17.049> Goku<00:04:17.729> meets<00:04:18.729> up<00:04:18.970> with<00:04:19.000> Goku<00:04:19.630> or<00:04:19.840> maybe

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
maybe Goku meets up with Goku or maybe

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.930 
maybe Goku meets up with Goku or maybe
he<00:04:20.320> meets<00:04:20.500> up<00:04:20.620> with<00:04:20.650> Bartok<00:04:21.070> there's<00:04:21.520> so<00:04:21.820> many

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
he meets up with Bartok there's so many

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.470 
he meets up with Bartok there's so many
possibilities<00:04:22.180> to<00:04:22.720> the<00:04:22.870> amount<00:04:23.200> of

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
possibilities to the amount of

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.330 
possibilities to the amount of
shit<00:04:23.690> that<00:04:23.900> akira<00:04:24.530> toriyama<00:04:24.830> could<00:04:25.100> do<00:04:25.190> right

shit that akira toriyama could do right

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.290 
shit that akira toriyama could do right
now<00:04:25.540> maybe<00:04:26.540> you<00:04:27.380> know<00:04:27.500> Goku<00:04:28.070> like<00:04:28.520> Tate's

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
now maybe you know Goku like Tate's

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.620 
now maybe you know Goku like Tate's
the<00:04:30.290> energy<00:04:30.680> of<00:04:30.890> other<00:04:31.400> Goku<00:04:32.060> and<00:04:32.240> then<00:04:32.480> he's

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
the energy of other Goku and then he's

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.390 
the energy of other Goku and then he's

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
is going to happen that's just the

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.780 
is going to happen that's just the
