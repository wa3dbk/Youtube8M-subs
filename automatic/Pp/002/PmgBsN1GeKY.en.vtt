00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 Hello guys my name is Misha as you 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.680
 probably know the output of the naval add-on 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.600
 strike 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.919
 delayed at least not yet 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.320
 as far as I know on xbox one 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.870
 however today's video topics will not 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.769
 quite the whole thing is that along with 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.980
 this addition 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.330
 I was waiting for another important event along with 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.100
 the addition should have been a patch 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.529
 which directly affects the balance 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.000
 I was very interested in playing games like him 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.529
 will be realized however since 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.300
 addition respectively patch 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.340
 delayed me interesting to discuss 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.830
 some aspects of this patch with you and 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.090
 maybe not everyone knows what 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.370
 suggested in this patch 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.170
 and how it affects the balance of the game and about the most 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.510
 important points I am interested in you 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.879
 tell well and by itself discuss them with 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.340
 you and the first topic to discuss 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.680
 I chose calves many know that 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.210
 to very few things to confess all 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.969
 tastes pieces windows last two three 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.530
 weeks at least the time was broken from 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.510
 he didnâ€™t show anyone at all 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.579
 killed sometimes showed you killed 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.379
 ally but sometimes it could be seen in 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.210
 chicks very strange funny things 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.699
 For example, I have repeatedly killed tanks with 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.100
 m320 now days say that 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.420
 calves will work as before all 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.580
 will be with this business in order and 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.750
 it is definitely very good 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.430
 news will now be possible again 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.080
 ok analyze your gameplay 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.270
 calculate the dressta comp which 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.490
 it is not clear in which bushes lie and everything is all 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.180
 in this spirit bale is very very 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.950
 important option 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.549
 next change which is literally 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:27.570
 caused my apparent interest this change 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.759
 in two rifles it is m16 a4 and carbine m4 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.619
 as you know these two trunks are inserted 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.270
 a cutoff of three rounds however let's 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.560
 let's face it 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.240
 moment name almost nobody 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.250
 enjoys because any player 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.960
 sound mind when starting to shoot out 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.180
 these machines quickly quickly understand 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.680
 which is essentially no advantage over 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.689
 other automatic weapons in the game 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.939
 these two trunks and no special meaning 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.009
 there is no correspondence either 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.659
 along the way give finally something 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.570
 here it was decided to reduce 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.000
 vertical recoil on m16 a4 and carbine 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.829
 M4 I hope that this decrease will be 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.390
 enough for the people to finally 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.060
 started using these two trunks 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.920
 and so that they finally stand in a row 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.200
 with other carbines and assault rifles 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.270
 rifles in this game the next moment 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.520
 in the future patch, I think the most important 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.920
 and this applies to spam grenades 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.650
 days go finally 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.239
 understand that this game has evolved from 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.580
 first person shooter at least 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.410
 if we take exactly infantry battles she 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.410
 turned into essentially a shaking simulator 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:27.080
 screen spam grenades absolutely monster 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.340
 and he was such a very launch game if 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.959
 you think that I am only talking about 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.060
 operations shut the metro you you are very 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:36.290
 very wrong, I recently played here 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:39.590
 assault on the road golmud and as far as i am 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.260
 I remember on the assault on the country road and it's just 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.819
 disgusting guys spam grenades 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.030
 mind-blowing this is literally i'm not 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.720
 just kidding this simulator shaking screen 2014 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.000
 worse 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.410
 can not think of but the days will not be 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.730
 reduce the number of grenades which 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.580
 can take your infantryman 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.650
 they will increase the amount of time that 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.630
 required to replenish these grenades from 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.850
 ammunition boxes i hope they 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.160
 will increase it decently in order to 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.510
 the game has finally become at least some 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.090
 first person shooter 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.530
 They are a grenade thrower simulator following 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.170
 change also waited a very long time 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.750
 it concerns shotguns I don't know everyone and 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.540
 shotguns but certainly pump allah 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.840
 what do days days increase applied 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.579
 fractional damage why would they do it all 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.829
 matter in perkin on body armor which they 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:25.609
 stuck in this game but balance 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:27.650
 could not 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:29.600
 coast on a body armor not only reduces 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.549
 sniper rifle damage 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.900
 emphasis how many think it affects even 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:35.840
 many aspects in particular 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.060
 but damage done / and many, many times 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.040
 still at the very start of the game I came across 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.290
 situation when i shoot from charged 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.510
 shotguns on the enemy and often 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.980
 even shoot him in the back however in essence 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.940
 nothing happens it somehow 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.220
 stays alive 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.420
 and since you know all that horrible 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.370
 shotgun rather slow 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.079
 rate of fire so that's the enemy 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.970
 manages to turn around and until you do 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:57.440
 or second shot it just weighs down 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.470
 he is a headshot especially if the opponent 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:03.260
 experienced fraction before this patch 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.970
 so it will be a very very unreliable view 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.109
 ammunition i really hope that when 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.450
 almost the same 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:09.950
 the fraction will become a normal option in this 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.720
 the game is currently the only view 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.670
 ammunition pump action shotgun ah 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.410
 who work at least some 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.560
 permanent basis is flashed and 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:20.299
 The following significant change will affect 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.130
 transport helicopter and it's about 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:24.480
 his minigan ah you're probably here 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.310
 You know that the minigun for transport 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.720
 people are very very controversial weapons essentially 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.850
 have a transport helicopter at this 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.190
 moment there is no code how much is it 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.170
 normal defenses and surely you're all in 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.790
 know that when you shoot with these 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:38.310
 minigun of infantry which is 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.080
 on earth there is a feeling that you are like 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.640
 as if you are throwing stones at them and not 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.010
 shoot normal to change them 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.510
 bullets and for now if you 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.400
 start shooting at infantryman who 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.230
 aiming at the stinger until you kill him 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.450
 most likely he will have time to let you out 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:54.000
 almost two stinger type rockets that 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:56.880
 almost always death 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.740
 for a transport helicopter so here's the case 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.750
 not far off and soon damage from minions 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.970
 will be increased by how much 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.350
 unknown look but I hope 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.780
 which I naturally hope he doesn't 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:08.880
 will be somehow too embolistic 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:11.100
 transport helicopter at least get 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.020
 at least some kind of countermeasure at least some 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.060
 protection from all that shit which 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.410
 around him usually going on also 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.940
 next dress worth paying attention 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.430
 on one more change 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.690
 and she is tied to lead 130 and honestly 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.120
 saying it causes me 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:26.370
 conflicting emotions from one side to 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:29.550
 this moment if 130 really 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:32.670
 quite weak I admit it on the other 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:34.980
 sides of essay 130 this is one of the most 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:38.250
 annoying things in the game at 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:40.140
 least for me personally and yes of course he 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.850
 requires a certain well, naturally not 

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:44.000
 skill he requires just a certain 

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:46.620
 amount of time to kill someone 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.720
 however, he is really very, very me 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.520
 very annoying and quite open 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.140
 kospi or oman border type maps 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.710
 the gulf there is often no way 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:57.420
 avoid getting if 130 is yours 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:58.620
 as an infantryman usually has no 

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:59.400
 countermeasure which you can him 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.920
 to oppose 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.840
 it's just death flying you out of heaven and 

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:06.780
 you can't usually do anything about it 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:09.030
 yes theoretically you can dive with some kind 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.870
 shelter but shelter can be far from 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.880
 always find 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:13.200
 and in the battlefield and exist 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:16.650
 pretty pretty open spaces 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:18.870
 and against the 130 essay is very often difficult 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:20.460
 something to contrast what's up from 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:22.890
 will be made si 130 you ask me 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:24.870
 they his bafov they bang 

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:27.450
 each type of weapon is mounted on 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:29.160
 this very thing if 130 be he wrong and 

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:31.920
 honestly i don't know how to this 

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:34.230
 treat me personally if 130 

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:36.570
 is so know or irritable 

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:37.520
 factor in this game to me at least 

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:39.620
 it will be interesting 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.720
 your opinion about this flying 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:43.580
 object let's say the following and 

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.960
 last change for today which i 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:46.610
 I want to tell you is not so important 

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:50.000
 however there may be some pretty 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:52.490
 curious the bottom line is that golden martial 

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.590
 Sets, as far as I understand, will be given for 

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:57.080
 getting stars before the service topic either 

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:58.789
 other classes why is it done but for 

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.720
 so that people who are in swing already 

00:06:58.789 --> 00:07:01.520
 maximum level 

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:04.009
 could continue to open all sorts of not 

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:06.020
 open for now camouflage knives 

00:07:04.009 --> 00:07:08.030
 boost and experience and other very very 

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:09.620
