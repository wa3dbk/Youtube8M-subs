00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.430 
to what a cut performance that i'd done
in<00:00:31.360> my<00:00:31.509> last<00:00:31.689> video<00:00:31.950> so<00:00:33.570> it<00:00:34.570> does<00:00:34.810> check<00:00:35.230> that

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290 
5 6 7 and the four aces of fit kit right

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.800 
5 6 7 and the four aces of fit kit right
like<00:00:50.530> this<00:00:50.830> in<00:00:51.070> this<00:00:51.250> order<00:00:51.460> so<00:00:52.360> that<00:00:52.390> there's

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:52.810 
like this in this order so that there's

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.320 
like this in this order so that there's
a<00:00:52.930> at<00:00:53.560> the<00:00:53.710> two-phase<00:00:54.250> remains<00:00:54.610> on<00:00:54.730> top<00:00:55.000> and

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:55.330 
a at the two-phase remains on top and

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.480 
a at the two-phase remains on top and
place<00:00:56.230> the<00:00:56.410> right<00:00:56.620> on<00:00:56.770> top<00:00:56.980> I'll<00:00:57.160> show<00:00:57.310> you<00:00:57.370> it

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:57.490 
place the right on top I'll show you it

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.580 
place the right on top I'll show you it
for<00:00:57.670> the<00:00:57.760> last<00:00:57.910> time<00:00:58.240> it's<00:00:58.870> a<00:00:59.050> space<00:00:59.320> should<00:00:59.530> be

00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590 
for the last time it's a space should be

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.670 
for the last time it's a space should be
on<00:00:59.829> the<00:00:59.950> bottom<00:01:00.070> and<00:01:00.490> then<00:01:01.480> we<00:01:01.870> put<00:01:02.079> the<00:01:02.110> Rian

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
on the bottom and then we put the Rian

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.039 
on the bottom and then we put the Rian
Thal<00:01:02.920> don't<00:01:03.790> show<00:01:03.970> it<00:01:04.030> inspected<00:01:04.600> or<00:01:04.809> don't

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049 
Thal don't show it inspected or don't

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:09.649 
Thal don't show it inspected or don't
shuffle<00:01:05.259> of<00:01:05.470> that<00:01:05.710> but<00:01:05.920> you<00:01:06.040> can<00:01:06.189> give<00:01:06.479> some

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.690 

what<00:01:10.659> though<00:01:11.789> forcing<00:01:12.789> I<00:01:13.119> mean<00:01:13.950> false<00:01:14.950> cuts

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
what though forcing I mean false cuts

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.919 
what though forcing I mean false cuts
and<00:01:16.499> then<00:01:17.549> now<00:01:18.549> here<00:01:18.999> comes<00:01:19.299> one<00:01:19.630> of<00:01:19.689> the

00:01:19.919 --> 00:01:19.929 
and then now here comes one of the

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:22.980 
and then now here comes one of the
mathematic<00:01:20.649> okay<00:01:21.219> so<00:01:21.850> first<00:01:22.509> we<00:01:22.780> told

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
mathematic okay so first we told

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.739 
mathematic okay so first we told
