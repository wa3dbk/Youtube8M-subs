00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.670 

the<00:00:03.889> shape<00:00:04.100> is<00:00:04.220> an<00:00:04.310> ellipse<00:00:04.580> and<00:00:05.140> ellipses<00:00:06.140> are

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:06.680 
the shape is an ellipse and ellipses are

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.259 
the shape is an ellipse and ellipses are
an<00:00:07.009> interesting<00:00:07.279> type<00:00:07.670> of<00:00:07.700> shape<00:00:08.000> because

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:08.269 
an interesting type of shape because

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:09.879 
an interesting type of shape because
they<00:00:08.360> can<00:00:08.510> come<00:00:08.750> in<00:00:08.900> an<00:00:09.019> infinite<00:00:09.530> number<00:00:09.559> of

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:09.889 
they can come in an infinite number of

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:14.640 
they can come in an infinite number of
varieties<00:00:10.429> and<00:00:10.790> they<00:00:11.180> vary<00:00:11.830> according<00:00:12.830> to<00:00:13.180> the

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:14.650 
varieties and they vary according to the

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.140 
varieties and they vary according to the
focus<00:00:15.650> points<00:00:16.010> so<00:00:16.219> every<00:00:16.550> ellipse<00:00:16.789> has<00:00:16.939> two

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.150 
focus points so every ellipse has two

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.300 
focus points so every ellipse has two
focus<00:00:17.480> points<00:00:17.510> and<00:00:18.019> when<00:00:18.769> they're<00:00:18.890> very<00:00:19.070> close

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:19.310 
focus points and when they're very close

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.220 
focus points and when they're very close
together<00:00:19.490> you<00:00:19.880> get<00:00:20.029> a<00:00:20.060> circle<00:00:20.359> and<00:00:20.779> when

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
together you get a circle and when

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.109 
together you get a circle and when
they're<00:00:21.380> very<00:00:21.589> very<00:00:21.829> far<00:00:22.130> apart<00:00:22.249> they<00:00:22.789> become

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119 
they're very very far apart they become

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.189 
they're very very far apart they become
you<00:00:23.659> know<00:00:23.689> like<00:00:23.960> a<00:00:23.989> long<00:00:24.609> sort<00:00:25.609> of<00:00:25.699> a<00:00:26.199> extended

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:27.199 
you know like a long sort of a extended

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:29.019 
you know like a long sort of a extended
surfboard<00:00:27.800> or<00:00:27.919> something<00:00:28.189> like<00:00:28.279> that<00:00:28.339> the

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
surfboard or something like that the

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.909 
surfboard or something like that the
longest<00:00:29.390> you<00:00:29.539> can<00:00:29.659> get<00:00:29.810> is<00:00:29.989> an<00:00:30.169> eccentricity

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:30.919 
longest you can get is an eccentricity

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:33.069 
longest you can get is an eccentricity
of<00:00:31.279> one<00:00:31.579> where<00:00:31.789> actually<00:00:32.060> it's<00:00:32.599> no<00:00:32.720> longer<00:00:32.870> the

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
of one where actually it's no longer the

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:34.840 
of one where actually it's no longer the
lips<00:00:33.230> then<00:00:33.410> it's<00:00:33.560> a<00:00:33.649> parabola<00:00:33.890> and<00:00:34.280> the

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
lips then it's a parabola and the

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.299 
lips then it's a parabola and the
shortest<00:00:35.359> you<00:00:35.510> can<00:00:35.719> get<00:00:35.930> is<00:00:36.170> an<00:00:36.890> eccentricity

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309 
shortest you can get is an eccentricity

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:40.450 
shortest you can get is an eccentricity
of<00:00:37.550> zero<00:00:37.969> so<00:00:38.899> x<00:00:39.109> centricity<00:00:39.379> means<00:00:39.769> away<00:00:40.219> from

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
of zero so x centricity means away from

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.880 
of zero so x centricity means away from
the<00:00:40.609> circle<00:00:41.030> so<00:00:41.359> it's<00:00:41.570> zero<00:00:41.929> from<00:00:42.410> the<00:00:42.469> circle

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
the circle so it's zero from the circle

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.529 
the circle so it's zero from the circle
and<00:00:43.039> the<00:00:43.370> ellipse<00:00:43.399> with<00:00:43.820> an<00:00:43.940> eccentricity<00:00:44.329> of

00:00:44.529 --> 00:00:44.539 
and the ellipse with an eccentricity of

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:48.009 
and the ellipse with an eccentricity of
zero<00:00:44.870> is<00:00:45.140> a<00:00:45.199> circle<00:00:46.010> so<00:00:46.550> the<00:00:46.640> foci<00:00:47.090> here<00:00:47.600> or

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:48.019 
zero is a circle so the foci here or

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:52.750 
zero is a circle so the foci here or
focus<00:00:48.350> points<00:00:48.879> here<00:00:49.879> the<00:00:50.239> dot<00:00:50.510> and<00:00:51.250> here<00:00:52.250> the

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
focus points here the dot and here the

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.150 
focus points here the dot and here the
pocket<00:00:53.120> and<00:00:53.300> the<00:00:53.660> exit<00:00:53.960> intricity<00:00:54.230> of<00:00:54.679> this

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
pocket and the exit intricity of this

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.130 
pocket and the exit intricity of this
one<00:00:55.370> is<00:00:56.980> zero<00:00:57.980> point<00:00:58.280> four<00:00:58.609> three<00:00:58.879> now<00:00:59.570> you<00:00:59.629> can

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
one is zero point four three now you can

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.470 
one is zero point four three now you can
calculate<00:01:00.379> it<00:01:00.829> by<00:01:01.370> taking<00:01:01.850> pounds<00:01:02.329> in<00:01:02.420> the

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
calculate it by taking pounds in the

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.950 
calculate it by taking pounds in the
distance<00:01:02.929> between<00:01:03.140> two<00:01:03.710> focus<00:01:04.040> points<00:01:04.070> and

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
distance between two focus points and

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.780 
distance between two focus points and
dividing<00:01:05.960> it<00:01:06.080> by<00:01:06.320> the<00:01:06.650> distance<00:01:07.430> of<00:01:07.550> the<00:01:07.610> major

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
dividing it by the distance of the major

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.610 
dividing it by the distance of the major
axis<00:01:08.270> so<00:01:08.540> that's<00:01:08.720> how<00:01:08.840> you<00:01:08.900> find<00:01:08.990> out<00:01:09.350> what<00:01:09.530> it

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:09.620 
axis so that's how you find out what it

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.440 
axis so that's how you find out what it
is<00:01:09.650> we<00:01:10.190> know<00:01:10.310> that<00:01:10.460> planets<00:01:10.700> orbit<00:01:11.180> in

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
is we know that planets orbit in

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.600 
is we know that planets orbit in
ellipses<00:01:12.080> the<00:01:12.680> orbit<00:01:12.920> of<00:01:12.980> the<00:01:13.040> earth<00:01:13.280> is

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
ellipses the orbit of the earth is

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.110 
ellipses the orbit of the earth is
really<00:01:14.390> small<00:01:14.780> so<00:01:14.990> I<00:01:15.110> think<00:01:15.760> 0.01<00:01:16.760> something

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.120 
really small so I think 0.01 something

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.030 
really small so I think 0.01 something
like<00:01:17.240> that<00:01:17.480> the<00:01:17.990> planet<00:01:18.380> with<00:01:18.560> the<00:01:18.590> greatest

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
like that the planet with the greatest

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.540 
like that the planet with the greatest
eccentricities<00:01:19.460> mercury<00:01:20.210> it's<00:01:20.560> 0.2<00:01:21.560> so<00:01:22.460> you

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:22.550 
eccentricities mercury it's 0.2 so you

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.100 
eccentricities mercury it's 0.2 so you
don't<00:01:22.670> have<00:01:22.730> any<00:01:22.910> planets<00:01:23.480> that<00:01:23.630> looking<00:01:23.960> like

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
don't have any planets that looking like

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.690 
don't have any planets that looking like
this<00:01:24.230> so<00:01:24.440> obviously<00:01:24.620> when<00:01:25.010> something<00:01:25.340> orbits

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
this so obviously when something orbits

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.290 
this so obviously when something orbits
that's<00:01:26.270> the<00:01:26.480> Sun<00:01:27.160> the<00:01:28.160> orbit<00:01:28.610> is<00:01:28.850> the<00:01:29.090> ellipse

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.300 
that's the Sun the orbit is the ellipse

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.940 
that's the Sun the orbit is the ellipse
around<00:01:29.450> it<00:01:29.840> because<00:01:30.200> you<00:01:30.320> orbit<00:01:30.620> around<00:01:30.710> a

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
around it because you orbit around a

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.320 
around it because you orbit around a
focus<00:01:31.310> point<00:01:31.460> you<00:01:31.670> don't<00:01:31.820> actually<00:01:31.940> all<00:01:32.180> be

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
focus point you don't actually all be

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:33.610 
focus point you don't actually all be
around<00:01:32.570> the<00:01:32.630> center<00:01:32.990> you<00:01:33.080> orbit<00:01:33.380> around<00:01:33.470> the

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:33.620 
around the center you orbit around the

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.250 
around the center you orbit around the
focus<00:01:33.950> point<00:01:34.190> and<00:01:34.370> the<00:01:35.030> SIRT<00:01:35.300> the<00:01:35.660> types<00:01:36.050> of

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.260 
focus point and the SIRT the types of

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.500 
focus point and the SIRT the types of
things<00:01:36.590> that<00:01:36.950> will<00:01:37.490> have<00:01:37.700> orbits<00:01:38.300> of

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.510 
things that will have orbits of

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.430 
things that will have orbits of
eccentricity<00:01:40.270> 0.43<00:01:41.270> are<00:01:41.690> going<00:01:42.050> to<00:01:42.110> be<00:01:42.200> things

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
eccentricity 0.43 are going to be things

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.440 
eccentricity 0.43 are going to be things
like<00:01:42.530> comets<00:01:43.040> so<00:01:43.640> there's<00:01:43.820> probably<00:01:43.940> comet

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
like comets so there's probably comet

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.860 
like comets so there's probably comet
out<00:01:44.570> there<00:01:44.900> that<00:01:45.500> is<00:01:46.030> exactly<00:01:47.030> this

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:47.870 
out there that is exactly this

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.780 
out there that is exactly this
elliptical<00:01:48.380> shape<00:01:48.590> the<00:01:49.010> reason<00:01:49.280> why<00:01:49.370> I<00:01:49.400> chose

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
elliptical shape the reason why I chose

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.440 
elliptical shape the reason why I chose
an<00:01:50.000> eccentricity<00:01:50.480> of<00:01:50.810> 0.4<00:01:51.500> 3<00:01:51.770> is<00:01:51.950> because<00:01:52.760> if

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
an eccentricity of 0.4 3 is because if

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.230 
an eccentricity of 0.4 3 is because if
it<00:01:53.930> was<00:01:54.080> any<00:01:54.490> closer<00:01:55.490> together

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
it was any closer together

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.760 
it was any closer together
any<00:01:56.450> lower<00:01:56.870> X<00:01:57.050> inches<00:01:57.230> it<00:01:57.530> would<00:01:57.620> just<00:01:57.740> look

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
any lower X inches it would just look

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.500 
any lower X inches it would just look
like<00:01:57.890> a<00:01:58.010> circle<00:01:58.550> and<00:01:58.700> then<00:01:58.820> you<00:01:58.910> wouldn't<00:01:59.150> get

00:01:59.500 --> 00:01:59.510 
like a circle and then you wouldn't get

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:00.970 
like a circle and then you wouldn't get
the<00:01:59.690> point<00:01:59.960> that<00:02:00.110> this<00:02:00.230> is<00:02:00.380> an<00:02:00.500> ellipse<00:02:00.770> you'd

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:00.980 
the point that this is an ellipse you'd

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.500 
the point that this is an ellipse you'd
think<00:02:01.130> oh<00:02:01.280> yeah<00:02:01.490> it's<00:02:01.850> the<00:02:01.970> circular<00:02:02.360> pool

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
think oh yeah it's the circular pool

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.300 
think oh yeah it's the circular pool
table<00:02:02.870> and<00:02:03.020> the<00:02:03.410> reason<00:02:03.680> I<00:02:03.740> didn't<00:02:04.010> want<00:02:04.040> it

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
table and the reason I didn't want it

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.550 
table and the reason I didn't want it
any<00:02:04.490> larger<00:02:05.210> is<00:02:05.390> that<00:02:05.840> when<00:02:05.960> it<00:02:06.080> starts<00:02:06.350> to<00:02:06.440> get

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
any larger is that when it starts to get

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.759 
any larger is that when it starts to get
narrow<00:02:06.920> it's<00:02:07.610> really<00:02:08.119> difficult<00:02:08.330> to

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:08.769 
narrow it's really difficult to

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:12.100 
narrow it's really difficult to
negotiate<00:02:09.769> the<00:02:10.720> bouncing<00:02:11.720> against<00:02:11.960> the

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
negotiate the bouncing against the

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.240 
negotiate the bouncing against the
corners<00:02:12.440> because<00:02:12.560> they<00:02:12.710> can<00:02:12.830> become<00:02:12.920> a<00:02:13.040> bit

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
corners because they can become a bit

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.550 
corners because they can become a bit
too<00:02:13.370> tight<00:02:13.640> and<00:02:13.970> you<00:02:14.360> get<00:02:14.510> this<00:02:14.630> game<00:02:14.960> which<00:02:15.530> is

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
too tight and you get this game which is

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.930 
too tight and you get this game which is
really<00:02:15.950> long<00:02:16.160> and<00:02:16.220> thin

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
really long and thin

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.220 
really long and thin
so<00:02:17.060> it<00:02:17.150> doesn't<00:02:17.450> make<00:02:17.600> for<00:02:17.900> such<00:02:18.080> an

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
so it doesn't make for such an

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:48.970 
so it doesn't make for such an
interesting<00:02:18.440> game<00:02:47.440> got<00:02:48.440> folks<00:02:48.650> Paula<00:02:48.860> here

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
interesting game got folks Paula here

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:49.810 
interesting game got folks Paula here
and<00:02:49.100> folks<00:02:49.250> one<00:02:49.430> there

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
and folks one there

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.570 
and folks one there
if<00:02:49.880> the<00:02:50.360> ball<00:02:50.540> is<00:02:50.660> within<00:02:50.870> it<00:02:51.110> if<00:02:52.070> I<00:02:52.250> hit<00:02:52.550> it

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
if the ball is within it if I hit it

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.330 
if the ball is within it if I hit it
between<00:02:53.120> the<00:02:53.480> focus<00:02:53.810> points<00:02:54.200> like<00:02:54.740> this<00:02:55.010> is

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
between the focus points like this is

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.920 
between the focus points like this is
it's<00:02:58.340> only<00:02:58.670> ever<00:02:58.790> going<00:02:58.940> to<00:02:59.000> stay<00:02:59.270> between

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
it's only ever going to stay between

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:00.490 
it's only ever going to stay between
them

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
them

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.170 
them
I<00:03:00.530> could<00:03:01.160> try<00:03:01.430> so<00:03:02.150> like<00:03:02.360> here<00:03:03.880> it's<00:03:04.880> only<00:03:05.000> ever

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
I could try so like here it's only ever

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.000 
I could try so like here it's only ever
going<00:03:05.390> to<00:03:05.450> stay<00:03:05.630> or<00:03:06.020> that<00:03:06.260> well<00:03:06.620> there<00:03:06.770> it<00:03:06.860> goes

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
going to stay or that well there it goes

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.980 
going to stay or that well there it goes
out<00:03:07.190> because<00:03:07.400> it<00:03:07.520> got<00:03:07.610> some<00:03:07.760> spin<00:03:08.000> on<00:03:08.030> that<00:03:08.330> so

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:08.990 
out because it got some spin on that so

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.940 
out because it got some spin on that so
you've<00:03:09.110> got<00:03:09.200> that<00:03:09.290> interesting<00:03:09.620> thing<00:03:09.770> here

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
you've got that interesting thing here

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.540 
you've got that interesting thing here
and<00:03:10.100> if<00:03:10.310> you<00:03:10.850> are<00:03:10.880> behind<00:03:12.010> it's<00:03:13.010> never<00:03:13.340> going

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
and if you are behind it's never going

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.040 
and if you are behind it's never going
to<00:03:13.610> be<00:03:13.700> able<00:03:13.820> to<00:03:14.000> bounce<00:03:14.240> in<00:03:14.540> between<00:03:14.840> those

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
to be able to bounce in between those

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.470 
to be able to bounce in between those
two<00:03:15.380> if<00:03:15.680> you<00:03:15.860> outside<00:03:16.610> of<00:03:16.790> the<00:03:16.850> folks<00:03:17.030> points

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
two if you outside of the folks points

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.320 
two if you outside of the folks points
so<00:03:18.520> it<00:03:19.520> just<00:03:19.670> keeps<00:03:19.820> on<00:03:19.880> going<00:03:20.030> around<00:03:20.150> the

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
so it just keeps on going around the

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.010 
so it just keeps on going around the
side<00:03:22.030> so<00:03:23.030> what<00:03:23.180> you<00:03:23.300> get<00:03:23.480> is<00:03:23.810> really

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020 
side so what you get is really

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.680 
side so what you get is really
interesting<00:03:24.739> patterns<00:03:25.220> that<00:03:25.580> you<00:03:26.480> know<00:03:26.570> the

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
interesting patterns that you know the

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.210 
interesting patterns that you know the
mathematical<00:03:27.290> geometrical<00:03:27.770> patterns<00:03:28.070> that

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
mathematical geometrical patterns that

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.070 
mathematical geometrical patterns that
you<00:03:28.340> know<00:03:28.580> it's<00:03:28.790> going<00:03:28.940> to<00:03:29.030> do<00:03:29.209> but<00:03:29.870> they're

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
you know it's going to do but they're

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.140 
you know it's going to do but they're
slightly<00:03:30.440> twisted<00:03:31.280> by<00:03:31.700> the<00:03:31.730> real-world
