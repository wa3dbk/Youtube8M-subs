00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.869
 see I will be blindfold yet 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.910
 light the some sentences of the initial of the 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:25.019
 book and sitting wine have points 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:27.869

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.759
 what I really like these Jews 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:36.059
 they came tell me ok but the first free 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.360
 first book there is only one case mirror 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.629
 my 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.640
 from the real they gave high stature but now 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.649
 in all this I chose it easy 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.559
 let's do it open because I like it 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.160
 feeling that it is my own 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.170
 favorite that she knows he elected her 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.670
 it is now well known that he has a bachelor 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:01:01.949
 possession of considerable fortune not 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:03.809
 I want to know exactly what he will eat 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.909
 I felt trapped as in one of 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.890
 those terrifying nightmares in which to 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.229
 as well as admissions until noises do not 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.340
 you burst out you never know fast enough 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:18.330
 but what is twilight 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:23.009
 no, but I was trying to make myself stay 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:27.689
 in the madding crowd and I'm not there 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:30.240
 to cerumen wants to be a very member 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.970

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.119

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.540
 book the dense fog to all the hearing goes 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:42.960
 and limited the view 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:47.310
 so yes no if I have things things I have 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:51.259
 bed can be read in the places where it will be said 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:54.479
 after a while weligton of the laugh will arise 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:58.579
 the slippery road wet in black by 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:01.980
 rain is the first rival buell angel 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:06.400
 no to the principles 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:08.229
 However, in order to prim devas the ring I 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.920
 I was a brother your health not for the 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:19.020

 volume that is easy because you can not 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:31.600
 touch because before the lightning 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:34.840
 hit johnston object is a party 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:38.430

 gates who faints everywhere this enne 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:49.750

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:20.200

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:22.780
 agility and los angels is not to people 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:28.150
 East challenges the more the fear in front is 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:31.299

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.970
 cassandra clare as it really is what it is 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:37.360
 the boy sitting in front of him did 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:41.170

 of the last sea candy cities 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:56.730
 volume and a tome hate but the bible is known 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.730

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.950
 yes you liked it but i think it is from 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:05.480

 behind of the book you have enough in sells to 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:35.180
 price if they are intelligent but what 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.910
 faced the beginning and started from 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:45.580
 end I knew in the end for those 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:45.580
 eyes resembled death in the bed 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:56.060
 day sentence if they had warned me is 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:05:05.840
 all very thin style here 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:09.169
 so follow those eyes never read 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:11.300
 all the beginning we start from the end it 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:13.490

 you miss the first failed one 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:47.009
