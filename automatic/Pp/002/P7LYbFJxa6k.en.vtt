00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:11.940
 do you know that in pigeons 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:14.759
 the most deserved postmen in history 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.310
 humanity now when we have 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.550
 cellular and internet 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.640
 pigeon mail seems almost fabulous 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.599
 phenomenon really is in the pigeon 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:33.079
 the mail is one mystery that scientists 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:36.800
 solved many years like pigeons 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.800
 deliver letters 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.649
 pigeon of course can not as usual 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.190
 postman delivering letters by different 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.350
 addresses 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.320
 but he can find his way to his native 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:53.750
 dovecote no matter how far he was taken 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:57.120
 from the house imagine two cities moscow and 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:59.789
 Ekaterinburg each has its own 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.969
 Dovecote so that city dwellers can 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.719
 exchange information pigeons changing 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.200
 in places 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:10.040
 then the birds with the letters are released and they 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:14.210
 fly to his home 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:16.310
 and where is their postman bag first 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.980
 Dove letters were hung around the neck or 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.320
 tied masonry later steel 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.300
 use another way of writing 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.030
 inserted into the core of a goose feather 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.760
 who tied to the tail perrin 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.860
 combi 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:34.760
 1 pigeon service for private letters 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:38.540
 was created in New Zealand 150 years 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:43.250
 back soon the pigeon post swept 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:46.460
 the whole world came up with even special letters 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.320
 pigeons gram on letters photographed 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.440
 so that on one frame of film 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.300
 placed several messages dove for 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.180
 one flight could deliver 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:02:00.380
 few pigeons grams placed in 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:03.259
 metal container carrier pigeons 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:06.380
 were in the army service and even 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:08.600
 accomplished exploits so during the first 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.120
 world war goals by name 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.989
 Sher Ami came under fire 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.560
 adversary 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:19.070
 they broke his wing and wounded him in the chest 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.910
 he still flew scale and handed 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:26.490
 letter 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.490
 for feat naked was awarded the Order 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.560
 the middle of the 20th century to replace the pigeon 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.530
 airmail arrived 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:38.319
 but people continue to keep postage 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:42.100
 pigeons and even arrange Olympiad 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:44.500
 Dove mail and recently Moscow 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:49.870
 pigeon set a distance record 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:52.720
 flight he returned home from japan as 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.280
 does the pigeon navigate when it flies 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.820
 home 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:59.830
 this secret still worries scientists in 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.500
 different times were put forward version 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:05.980
 pigeons navigate by the sun on 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.880
 smells but pigeons fly at night when 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.580
 there is no sun 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.780
 they fly above the water where there is no 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.780
 variety of smells 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:20.680
 scientists have concluded that the main 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:24.579
 landmark doves magnetic radiation 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:27.700
 fields of land in their beak doves are magnetic 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:30.250
 particles that play the role of a compass with 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:33.360
 using this built-in compass 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:37.810
 birds determines their location and 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.739
 choose the right direction of flight so 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.799
 in the same way 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:44.530
 migratory birds find their way 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:47.620
 it is a pity that we have such a built-in 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.930
 there is no compass even in the forest man 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.000
 can find a way home without a card and 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:55.720
 compass but only with 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.150
 knowledge of the laws of nature is solid 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.310
 studying the world so as not to 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.790
 get lost and here 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.790
 guessing
