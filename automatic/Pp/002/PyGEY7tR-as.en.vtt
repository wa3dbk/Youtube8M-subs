00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.740 
and if you could preserve these animals
for<00:05:40.160> our<00:05:40.270> grandchildren<00:05:41.270> great

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 
for our grandchildren great

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.200 
for our grandchildren great
grandchildren<00:05:41.800> and<00:05:42.800> what<00:05:43.130> greater<00:05:43.580> gift<00:05:43.700> and

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.210 
grandchildren and what greater gift and

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.420 
grandchildren and what greater gift and
kin<00:05:44.479> can<00:05:44.780> people<00:05:45.140> give<00:05:45.380> to<00:05:45.680> the<00:05:45.800> to<00:05:45.979> you<00:05:46.130> to<00:05:46.310> do

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.430 
kin can people give to the to you to do

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.730 
kin can people give to the to you to do
the<00:05:46.700> plaza<00:05:47.000> legacy<00:05:47.600> the<00:05:47.900> other<00:05:48.050> problem<00:05:48.530> is

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:48.740 
the plaza legacy the other problem is

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:51.070 
the plaza legacy the other problem is
that<00:05:48.770> you<00:05:49.010> were<00:05:49.130> saying<00:05:49.430> about<00:05:49.660> Africa<00:05:50.660> and

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
that you were saying about Africa and

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.280 
that you were saying about Africa and
pure<00:05:51.410> countries<00:05:51.950> the<00:05:52.729> problem<00:05:53.240> is<00:05:53.600> that<00:05:53.840> is

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:54.290 
pure countries the problem is that is

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:56.350 
pure countries the problem is that is
that<00:05:54.590> it's<00:05:55.460> good<00:05:55.669> to<00:05:55.790> do<00:05:55.940> all<00:05:56.120> those<00:05:56.300> things

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:56.360 
that it's good to do all those things

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.990 
that it's good to do all those things
and<00:05:56.750> it's<00:05:56.870> fantastic<00:05:57.050> but<00:05:57.740> the<00:05:58.340> poor<00:05:58.580> people

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 
and it's fantastic but the poor people

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.740 
and it's fantastic but the poor people
don't<00:05:59.180> reap<00:05:59.450> the<00:05:59.600> benefits

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
don't reap the benefits

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:03.230 
don't reap the benefits
and<00:06:01.200> so<00:06:01.440> therefore<00:06:02.100> you<00:06:02.370> know<00:06:02.490> they<00:06:02.700> they<00:06:03.000> do

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 
and so therefore you know they they do

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.550 
and so therefore you know they they do
those<00:06:03.480> things<00:06:03.780> for<00:06:04.350> completely<00:06:04.950> for<00:06:05.310> survival

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 
those things for completely for survival

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.140 
those things for completely for survival
after<00:06:07.560> the<00:06:08.070> people<00:06:08.400> that<00:06:08.580> did<00:06:08.790> all<00:06:08.940> those

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.150 
after the people that did all those

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.510 
after the people that did all those
things<00:06:09.210> also<00:06:09.960> took<00:06:10.620> care<00:06:10.860> of<00:06:10.890> the<00:06:11.070> people<00:06:11.430> at

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 
things also took care of the people at

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.520 
things also took care of the people at
the<00:06:11.610> same<00:06:11.790> time<00:06:11.850> they<00:06:12.810> wouldn't<00:06:13.020> have<00:06:13.230> to<00:06:13.380> do

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:13.530 
the same time they wouldn't have to do

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:15.110 
the same time they wouldn't have to do
the<00:06:13.650> things<00:06:13.890> that<00:06:13.950> they<00:06:14.190> do<00:06:14.370> yeah<00:06:14.760> there's

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 
the things that they do yeah there's

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.060 
the things that they do yeah there's
some<00:06:15.270> projects<00:06:15.720> now<00:06:15.870> that<00:06:16.050> are<00:06:16.170> yes<00:06:16.560> yeah<00:06:17.040> that

some projects now that are yes yeah that

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:18.800 
some projects now that are yes yeah that
direction<00:06:17.550> where<00:06:17.940> there's<00:06:18.150> a<00:06:18.300> lot<00:06:18.690> of

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:18.810 
direction where there's a lot of

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:21.470 
direction where there's a lot of
programs<00:06:19.170> usually<00:06:19.910> all<00:06:20.910> sorts<00:06:21.420> of

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:21.480 
programs usually all sorts of

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.840 
programs usually all sorts of
associations<00:06:22.260> that<00:06:22.500> are<00:06:22.560> now<00:06:22.830> I'm<00:06:23.580> just

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:23.850 
associations that are now I'm just

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:26.720 
associations that are now I'm just
working<00:06:24.030> with<00:06:24.390> a<00:06:24.870> group<00:06:25.200> now<00:06:25.470> to<00:06:25.530> dig<00:06:26.460> wells

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:26.730 
working with a group now to dig wells

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:30.170 
working with a group now to dig wells
and<00:06:27.090> ballet<00:06:27.360> and<00:06:28.110> I<00:06:28.950> started<00:06:29.490> the<00:06:29.850> hopeful

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:30.180 
and ballet and I started the hopeful

they're not doing well but there's all
sorts<00:06:34.740> of<00:06:34.830> technology<00:06:35.580> recently<00:06:35.940> that<00:06:36.780> will

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:37.050 
sorts of technology recently that will

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:40.160 
sorts of technology recently that will
return<00:06:38.010> air<00:06:38.310> and<00:06:38.730> take<00:06:38.910> that<00:06:39.120> most<00:06:39.720> moisture

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:40.170 
return air and take that most moisture

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:41.680 
return air and take that most moisture
out<00:06:40.290> of<00:06:40.320> the<00:06:40.530> air<00:06:40.560> and<00:06:40.710> turned<00:06:41.100> into<00:06:41.310> water

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:41.690 
out of the air and turned into water

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:44.090 
out of the air and turned into water
there's<00:06:42.690> all<00:06:42.870> kinds<00:06:43.230> of<00:06:43.290> different<00:06:43.470> programs

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:44.100 
there's all kinds of different programs

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.620 
there's all kinds of different programs
technology<00:06:44.790> was<00:06:45.030> really<00:06:45.240> doing<00:06:45.600> very

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:45.630 
technology was really doing very

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:47.480 
technology was really doing very
high-tech<00:06:46.290> okay

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:47.490 
high-tech okay

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:50.450 
high-tech okay
well<00:06:47.880> thank<00:06:48.090> you<00:06:48.150> so<00:06:48.390> much<00:06:48.630> Mercer<00:06:49.500> for<00:06:49.740> Dora
