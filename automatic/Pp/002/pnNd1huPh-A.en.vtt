whole suit with this iPhone app that I

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.029 
whole suit with this iPhone app that I
wrote<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.350> you<00:00:25.350> can<00:00:25.500> see<00:00:25.590> here<00:00:25.740> I<00:00:25.769> press

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
wrote and you can see here I press

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.740 
wrote and you can see here I press
connect<00:00:26.340> I<00:00:26.550> can<00:00:26.730> type<00:00:26.849> in<00:00:26.880> an<00:00:27.029> IP<00:00:27.060> address<00:00:27.539> and

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
connect I can type in an IP address and

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.300 
connect I can type in an IP address and
then<00:00:28.289> of<00:00:28.380> course<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:28.680> gives<00:00:28.740> me<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:28.920> list<00:00:29.160> of

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
then of course it gives me a list of

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.679 
then of course it gives me a list of
sequences<00:00:29.789> right<00:00:29.939> now<00:00:30.060> I<00:00:30.090> have<00:00:30.390> three

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
sequences right now I have three

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.089 
sequences right now I have three
programs<00:00:30.929> but<00:00:31.380> there's<00:00:31.679> gonna<00:00:31.800> be<00:00:31.949> more

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
programs but there's gonna be more

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.549 
programs but there's gonna be more
coming<00:00:32.340> soon<00:00:32.550> so<00:00:33.300> I'm<00:00:34.079> just<00:00:34.200> gonna<00:00:34.290> go<00:00:34.469> right

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
coming soon so I'm just gonna go right

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.700 
coming soon so I'm just gonna go right
in<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:35.040> run<00:00:35.489> this<00:00:35.670> ring<00:00:36.030> sequence<00:00:36.710> basically

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
in and run this ring sequence basically

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.319 
in and run this ring sequence basically
that<00:00:37.860> just<00:00:37.890> makes<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.280> bar<00:00:38.489> of<00:00:38.610> light<00:00:38.820> that<00:00:39.149> goes

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
that just makes a bar of light that goes

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.060 
that just makes a bar of light that goes
from<00:00:39.930> my<00:00:40.140> feet<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.530> my<00:00:40.559> neck<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:42.920> with<00:00:43.920> the

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
from my feet to my neck and with the

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.920 
from my feet to my neck and with the
parameters<00:00:44.550> on<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.730> screen<00:00:45.090> here<00:00:45.360> once<00:00:45.690> I<00:00:45.780> got

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
parameters on the screen here once I got

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.660 
parameters on the screen here once I got
into<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.170> ring<00:00:46.410> sequence<00:00:46.829> I<00:00:46.980> can<00:00:47.039> adjust<00:00:47.489> the

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
into the ring sequence I can adjust the

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.180 
into the ring sequence I can adjust the
speed<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.750> thickness<00:00:49.200> of<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.680> ring<00:00:49.890> so<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.160> can

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
speed the thickness of the ring so I can

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:50.840 
speed the thickness of the ring so I can
slow<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:50.640> down

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
slow it down

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.729 
slow it down
I<00:00:51.180> can<00:00:52.079> I<00:00:52.590> can<00:00:52.680> make<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.100> ring<00:00:53.399> really<00:00:53.969> thick

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
I can I can make the ring really thick

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:57.250 
I can I can make the ring really thick
you<00:00:55.739> know<00:00:55.770> I<00:00:55.860> can<00:00:56.039> I<00:00:56.070> get<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.250> bunch<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.520> pixels<00:00:56.850> I

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
you know I can I get a bunch of pixels I

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.170 
you know I can I get a bunch of pixels I
can<00:00:58.260> change<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.710> step<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.309> so<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.670> can<00:00:59.850> go

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
can change the step of it so it can go

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.750 
can change the step of it so it can go
really<00:01:00.329> fast<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:01.050> can<00:01:02.010> make<00:01:02.160> it<00:01:02.309> move<00:01:02.520> at<00:01:02.699> a

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
really fast I can make it move at a

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.299 
really fast I can make it move at a
different<00:01:03.030> direction<00:01:03.149> if<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.690> want<00:01:04.100> so<00:01:05.100> I<00:01:05.159> can

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
different direction if I want so I can

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.870 
different direction if I want so I can
make<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:05.519> move<00:01:05.640> down<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:07.369> can<00:01:08.369> change<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.670> color

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
make it move down I can change the color

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.690 
make it move down I can change the color
of<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.680> can<00:01:10.680> choose<00:01:10.830> any<00:01:11.010> color<00:01:11.189> I<00:01:11.280> want

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
of it can choose any color I want

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.320 
of it can choose any color I want
these<00:01:12.420> are<00:01:12.540> RGB<00:01:12.900> LEDs<00:01:13.830> I<00:01:14.100> can<00:01:14.909> also<00:01:15.030> bounce

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
these are RGB LEDs I can also bounce

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.039 
these are RGB LEDs I can also bounce
from<00:01:15.689> top<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:15.900> bottom<00:01:16.040> so<00:01:17.450> if<00:01:18.450> I<00:01:18.570> pick<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.810> bounce

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
from top to bottom so if I pick a bounce

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.120 
from top to bottom so if I pick a bounce
here<00:01:19.380> goes<00:01:19.920> back<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.460> forth<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:21.740> then<00:01:22.740> lastly

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
here goes back and forth and then lastly

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.160 
here goes back and forth and then lastly
I<00:01:23.250> have<00:01:23.310> an<00:01:23.460> accelerometer<00:01:23.880> in<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.750> sleeve

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
I have an accelerometer in the sleeve

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.600 
I have an accelerometer in the sleeve
here<00:01:25.470> where<00:01:26.430> if<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:26.729> raise<00:01:27.000> my<00:01:27.360> right<00:01:27.750> arm<00:01:28.610> it'll

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
here where if I raise my right arm it'll

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.890 
here where if I raise my right arm it'll
enable<00:01:29.790> this<00:01:30.090> option<00:01:30.299> called<00:01:30.689> sleeves<00:01:31.140> and

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
enable this option called sleeves and

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.719 
enable this option called sleeves and
sorry<00:01:33.900> you<00:01:33.990> can't<00:01:34.140> see<00:01:34.290> that<00:01:34.460> sleeves<00:01:35.460> down

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
sorry you can't see that sleeves down

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.730 
sorry you can't see that sleeves down
here<00:01:35.939> at<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.060> bottom<00:01:36.150> that<00:01:36.840> will<00:01:36.990> turn<00:01:37.110> on<00:01:37.170> and

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
here at the bottom that will turn on and

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.710 
here at the bottom that will turn on and
what<00:01:38.250> that<00:01:38.400> does<00:01:38.579> is<00:01:38.790> when<00:01:39.060> I<00:01:39.090> raise<00:01:39.270> my<00:01:39.420> arms

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
what that does is when I raise my arms

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.539 
what that does is when I raise my arms
it'll<00:01:40.020> go<00:01:40.170> all<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.560> way<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.860> sleeves<00:01:41.130> with

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
it'll go all the way to the sleeves with

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.249 
it'll go all the way to the sleeves with
the<00:01:41.579> rings<00:01:43.009> so<00:01:44.009> that's<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.210> ring<00:01:45.689> sequence

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
the rings so that's the ring sequence

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.840 
the rings so that's the ring sequence
here's<00:01:46.860> another<00:01:46.950> sequence<00:01:47.430> that<00:01:47.610> I<00:01:47.670> called

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
here's another sequence that I called

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.660 
here's another sequence that I called
splotches<00:01:48.390> for<00:01:48.630> lack<00:01:48.780> of<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.960> better<00:01:48.990> term

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
splotches for lack of a better term

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.340 
splotches for lack of a better term
basically<00:01:50.670> that<00:01:50.939> just<00:01:51.090> creates<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.720> pattern<00:01:52.020> of

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
basically that just creates a pattern of

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.510 
basically that just creates a pattern of
random<00:01:53.250> LEDs<00:01:53.729> that<00:01:54.090> show<00:01:54.720> up<00:01:55.100> this<00:01:56.100> time<00:01:56.159> it's

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
random LEDs that show up this time it's

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.399 
random LEDs that show up this time it's
I've<00:01:56.969> picked<00:01:57.210> green<00:01:57.509> as<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.869> color<00:01:58.049> but<00:01:58.229> I<00:01:58.290> can

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
I've picked green as the color but I can

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.639 
I've picked green as the color but I can
pick<00:01:58.530> any<00:01:58.649> color<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:58.979> want<00:01:59.219> I<00:02:00.110> can<00:02:01.110> you<00:02:01.560> know

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
pick any color I want I can you know

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.679 
pick any color I want I can you know
just<00:02:01.680> like<00:02:02.009> with<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.280> other<00:02:02.430> sequences<00:02:03.420> I<00:02:03.540> can

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
just like with the other sequences I can

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.359 
just like with the other sequences I can
speed<00:02:04.049> it<00:02:04.079> up<00:02:04.229> slow<00:02:04.469> it<00:02:04.500> down<00:02:04.649> change<00:02:05.250> the

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
speed it up slow it down change the

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.540 
speed it up slow it down change the
color<00:02:05.549> I<00:02:06.450> can<00:02:06.810> select<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.259> amount<00:02:07.590> so<00:02:08.129> if<00:02:08.459> I

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
color I can select the amount so if I

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.699 
color I can select the amount so if I
want<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:08.759> lot<00:02:09.000> of<00:02:09.209> pixels<00:02:09.869> to<00:02:09.989> show<00:02:10.200> up<00:02:10.319> at<00:02:10.470> once

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
want a lot of pixels to show up at once

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.490 
want a lot of pixels to show up at once
I<00:02:10.890> can<00:02:11.039> do<00:02:11.129> that<00:02:11.280> I<00:02:11.580> can<00:02:12.420> also<00:02:12.540> add<00:02:12.810> flat

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
I can do that I can also add flat

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.240 
I can do that I can also add flat
sh'zazz<00:02:13.800> add<00:02:14.220> an<00:02:14.430> effect<00:02:14.520> to<00:02:14.910> it<00:02:15.030> so<00:02:16.250> that's

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
sh'zazz add an effect to it so that's

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.690 
sh'zazz add an effect to it so that's
kind<00:02:17.460> of<00:02:17.490> cool

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
kind of cool

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.930 
kind of cool
and<00:02:18.710> the<00:02:19.710> other<00:02:20.130> sequence<00:02:20.430> that<00:02:20.670> I<00:02:20.730> don't

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
and the other sequence that I don't

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.940 
and the other sequence that I don't
really<00:02:21.150> have<00:02:21.330> programmed<00:02:21.750> yet<00:02:21.900> on<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.350> iPhone

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
really have programmed yet on the iPhone

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.620 
really have programmed yet on the iPhone
but<00:02:23.610> it's<00:02:23.850> kind<00:02:24.000> of<00:02:24.030> cool<00:02:24.180> that<00:02:24.300> I<00:02:24.360> want<00:02:24.510> to

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
but it's kind of cool that I want to

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.830 
but it's kind of cool that I want to
demo<00:02:24.930> is<00:02:25.110> this<00:02:25.830> equalizer<00:02:26.340> sequence<00:02:26.850> and<00:02:27.450> so

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
demo is this equalizer sequence and so

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.510 
demo is this equalizer sequence and so
basically<00:02:28.290> I<00:02:28.410> have<00:02:28.680> a<00:02:28.710> microphone<00:02:29.190> on<00:02:29.250> this

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
basically I have a microphone on this

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.710 
basically I have a microphone on this
glove<00:02:29.790> here<00:02:30.030> and<00:02:30.800> when<00:02:31.800> I<00:02:32.300> detect<00:02:33.300> audio

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
glove here and when I detect audio

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.070 
glove here and when I detect audio
snapping<00:02:34.680> into<00:02:34.800> the<00:02:34.980> microphone<00:02:35.430> I<00:02:36.080> convert

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
snapping into the microphone I convert

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.620 
snapping into the microphone I convert
that<00:02:37.230> into<00:02:37.500> light<00:02:37.910> so<00:02:38.910> this<00:02:39.060> is<00:02:39.180> an<00:02:39.270> example<00:02:39.510> of

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
that into light so this is an example of

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:40.850 
that into light so this is an example of
me<00:02:39.750> just<00:02:39.959> tapping<00:02:40.230> on<00:02:40.440> the<00:02:40.500> microphone

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
me just tapping on the microphone

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.080 
me just tapping on the microphone
because<00:02:41.070> I<00:02:41.250> can't<00:02:41.430> really<00:02:41.610> yell<00:02:41.760> too<00:02:41.940> loud

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
because I can't really yell too loud

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.000 
because I can't really yell too loud
right<00:02:42.240> now<00:02:42.300> but<00:02:42.690> you<00:02:43.530> can<00:02:43.650> see<00:02:43.740> that<00:02:43.890> it

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
right now but you can see that it

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.449 
right now but you can see that it
creates<00:02:44.250> a<00:02:44.340> sort<00:02:44.520> of<00:02:44.610> equalizer<00:02:45.030> effect<00:02:45.390> and

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
creates a sort of equalizer effect and

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.130 
creates a sort of equalizer effect and
so<00:02:47.459> that's<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:47.790> demo<00:02:48.030> of<00:02:48.060> my<00:02:48.209> iPhone<00:02:48.600> control

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
so that's the demo of my iPhone control

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.110 
so that's the demo of my iPhone control
LED<00:02:49.350> suit<00:02:49.830> and<00:02:50.130> if<00:02:50.760> you're<00:02:50.850> going<00:02:50.970> to<00:02:51.030> be<00:02:51.090> a

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
LED suit and if you're going to be a

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.300 
LED suit and if you're going to be a

Dragon Con this weekend try to find me I

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.820 
Dragon Con this weekend try to find me I
shouldn't<00:02:53.670> be<00:02:53.730> too<00:02:54.090> hard<00:02:54.120> to<00:02:54.300> spot<00:02:54.480> and<00:02:55.020> feel

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
shouldn't be too hard to spot and feel

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.730
