00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 in work three years ago to 258 pm linking 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.460
 br 222 in the municipality of domingos mourão 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.260
 is causing a great deal of disruption to 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.500
 the residents of that region 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.800
 Last weekend I was in 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.600
 with one passenger and 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.119
 returning from Esperanto to here for 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.020
 Around six o'clock here came five 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.850
 afternoon hours 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.130
 I finished arriving here at nine ten o'clock 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.980
 the night because when I arrived at the 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.189
 bridge that are actually interdicting the 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.140
 if I drag the access I had to go back 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.239
 on the back I ended up losing on the plate 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.940
 My car then created a 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.710
 I'm worrying the situation of thousands 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.680
 of people who live here in the municipality 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.420
 of Sundays mourão that is 75 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.600
 kilometers of piripiri 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.969
 ap 258 that cuts the municipality goes to 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.960
 ceará currency is cut into several 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.579
 points 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.890
 in fact the whole car for bags 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.989
 dollar on christmas day year out of here with 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.059
 the gear shift in piripiri 12 hours 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.129
 11 reads guard the road that does not have 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.260
 access very poor access 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.150
 This way we're tired he comes 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.560
 earning us half a dollar for 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.049
 example the political campaign of the 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.760
 government deputy will appear a bit 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.890
 adapted here promising that perhaps 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.409
 to end the electoral period in 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.420
 make the road again the population is 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.090
 indignant with such delay for the 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.270
 conclusion of this work that would be 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.759
 improve access to the municipality that 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.220
 currency with the state of Ceará but until 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.110
 now it only caused problems because 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.590
 currently to arrive on Sundays 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.380
 You have to go through Pedro 2º or 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.890
 town bag polluters increasing 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.899
 about 40 kilometers along the route we 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.329
 on this afternoon from now on Saturday 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.520
 we are going there with the material that 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.470
 be very clear of the city and is a 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.680
 responsibility of the state and we will 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.810
 take this material and let's take a 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.670
 manhole to be able to give this 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.979
 water does not leave this isolation because 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.979
 today our access to piripiri is 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.210
 being through pedro 2º through the 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.850
 century polish 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.320
 if it rains in this region which is next 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.429
 east of Mourão Sundays and on the slopes 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.440
 with ceará 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.720
 this passage is also the serve 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.650
 impaired leaving only Peter's 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.230
 2º and increases 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.370
 routes and around 40 to 50 km for 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.280
 arrive in piripiri 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.890
 traders had a general lack of 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.659
 foodstuffs because of the difficulty 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.840
 access to the city 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:29.489
 our situation today we do not know 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.950
 But what to do even we have 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:35.010
 weeks here that does not have several companies 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.959
 no, no more representatives do not come 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.079
 came to make sales because they did not 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.549
 we have how we will not see if they do not have 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:43.950
 how to transport bring this merchandise 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:46.620
 the municipality and we are already having 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:50.519
 which in a way is practically 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:54.019
 rationing is the amount for the 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:54.019
 people to be able to not lack merchandise
