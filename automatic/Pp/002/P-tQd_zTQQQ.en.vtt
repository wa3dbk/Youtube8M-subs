00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:05.090 

so<00:00:02.669> this<00:00:02.850> lesson<00:00:03.090> is<00:00:03.650> over<00:00:04.650> the<00:00:04.770> difference

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
so this lesson is over the difference

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.820 
so this lesson is over the difference
between<00:00:05.460> a<00:00:05.490> scavenger<00:00:06.089> and<00:00:06.299> a<00:00:06.359> decomposer<00:00:06.960> now

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
between a scavenger and a decomposer now

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:08.960 
between a scavenger and a decomposer now
I'm<00:00:07.919> gonna<00:00:08.040> be<00:00:08.189> honest<00:00:08.460> with<00:00:08.580> you<00:00:08.670> guys<00:00:08.700> right

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
I'm gonna be honest with you guys right

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.220 
I'm gonna be honest with you guys right
up<00:00:09.059> front<00:00:09.480> I<00:00:09.889> can<00:00:10.889> never<00:00:11.519> remember<00:00:12.230> exactly

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
up front I can never remember exactly

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.259 
up front I can never remember exactly
what<00:00:13.410> makes<00:00:13.620> it<00:00:13.740> a<00:00:13.799> decomposer<00:00:14.340> instead<00:00:15.030> of<00:00:15.150> a

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
what makes it a decomposer instead of a

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.840 
what makes it a decomposer instead of a
scavenger<00:00:15.750> I<00:00:15.960> have<00:00:16.650> to<00:00:16.830> constantly<00:00:17.250> ask<00:00:17.640> the

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
scavenger I have to constantly ask the

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.580 
scavenger I have to constantly ask the
other<00:00:17.970> science<00:00:18.420> teachers<00:00:18.750> and<00:00:18.960> they<00:00:19.260> come<00:00:19.470> to

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
other science teachers and they come to

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.950 
other science teachers and they come to
me<00:00:19.710> too<00:00:19.920> asking<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.880> exact<00:00:21.270> same<00:00:21.449> question

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
me too asking the exact same question

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.099 
me too asking the exact same question
now<00:00:22.680> some<00:00:23.160> animals<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.300> creatures<00:00:24.689> and

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
now some animals and creatures and

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.320 
now some animals and creatures and
organisms<00:00:25.590> are<00:00:25.769> very<00:00:25.800> obviously<00:00:26.580> either<00:00:26.880> a

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
organisms are very obviously either a

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.000 
organisms are very obviously either a
scavenger<00:00:28.019> or<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:28.230> decomposer

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
scavenger or a decomposer

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.980 
scavenger or a decomposer
and<00:00:29.490> then<00:00:29.699> there<00:00:29.849> are<00:00:29.970> ones<00:00:30.179> in<00:00:30.330> between<00:00:30.449> that

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
and then there are ones in between that

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.389 
and then there are ones in between that
are<00:00:31.050> very<00:00:31.380> difficult<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.890> remember<00:00:32.130> which

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
are very difficult to remember which

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.729 
are very difficult to remember which
ones<00:00:32.610> are<00:00:32.759> which<00:00:32.880> so<00:00:33.380> looking<00:00:34.380> at<00:00:34.500> these<00:00:34.559> three

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
ones are which so looking at these three

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.370 
ones are which so looking at these three
bullet<00:00:35.100> points<00:00:35.130> that<00:00:35.520> we<00:00:35.579> have<00:00:35.760> here

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.380 
bullet points that we have here

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.240 
bullet points that we have here
obviously<00:00:37.380> I<00:00:37.440> know<00:00:37.530> you<00:00:37.649> can<00:00:37.860> read<00:00:38.040> for

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
obviously I know you can read for

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.610 
obviously I know you can read for
yourself<00:00:38.280> but<00:00:39.270> let<00:00:39.570> me<00:00:39.660> describe<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.290> talk<00:00:40.469> to

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
yourself but let me describe and talk to

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.400 
yourself but let me describe and talk to
you<00:00:40.710> about<00:00:40.800> what<00:00:41.040> they<00:00:41.219> say<00:00:41.600> so<00:00:42.629> scavengers

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
you about what they say so scavengers

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.100 
you about what they say so scavengers
are<00:00:43.559> usually<00:00:44.300> larger<00:00:45.300> animals<00:00:45.660> that<00:00:45.750> start

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
are usually larger animals that start

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.350 
are usually larger animals that start
the<00:00:46.260> decomposing<00:00:46.860> process<00:00:47.520> they<00:00:47.850> do<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:48.120> by

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
the decomposing process they do that by

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.650 
the decomposing process they do that by
eating<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.230> large<00:00:49.530> remains<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.489> dead<00:00:51.120> animals

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
eating the large remains of dead animals

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.740 
eating the large remains of dead animals
or<00:00:51.930> dead<00:00:52.199> things<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:52.949> are<00:00:53.070> found<00:00:53.570> so<00:00:54.570> the

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
or dead things that are found so the

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.600 
or dead things that are found so the
second<00:00:55.110> bullet<00:00:55.260> point<00:00:55.350> says<00:00:55.800> that<00:00:56.010> as<00:00:56.190> well

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
second bullet point says that as well

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.470 
second bullet point says that as well
scavengers<00:00:57.600> are<00:00:57.750> large<00:00:57.960> animals<00:00:58.260> okay

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
scavengers are large animals okay

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.939 
scavengers are large animals okay
decomposers<00:01:00.480> are<00:01:00.930> often<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.620> smaller

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
decomposers are often the smaller

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.340 
decomposers are often the smaller
organisms<00:01:02.460> like<00:01:03.059> really<00:01:03.809> small<00:01:04.080> organisms

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
organisms like really small organisms

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.300 
organisms like really small organisms
mostly<00:01:05.450> insects<00:01:06.450> or<00:01:06.780> even<00:01:07.500> microorganisms

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
mostly insects or even microorganisms

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.840 
mostly insects or even microorganisms
like<00:01:08.369> bacteria<00:01:09.260> it's<00:01:10.260> also<00:01:10.439> fungi<00:01:11.040> so<00:01:11.580> not

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
like bacteria it's also fungi so not

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.390 
like bacteria it's also fungi so not
even<00:01:12.119> animal<00:01:12.570> kingdom<00:01:13.470> but<00:01:13.500> other<00:01:13.950> kingdoms

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
even animal kingdom but other kingdoms

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:14.990 
even animal kingdom but other kingdoms
as<00:01:14.520> well

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
as well

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.929 
as well
there<00:01:15.869> are<00:01:15.960> also<00:01:16.080> some<00:01:16.890> plants<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:17.490> are

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
there are also some plants that are

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.310 
there are also some plants that are
parasitic<00:01:18.570> that<00:01:18.930> also<00:01:19.110> break<00:01:19.470> down<00:01:20.270> other

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
parasitic that also break down other

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.859 
parasitic that also break down other
decomposing<00:01:22.320> stuff<00:01:22.590> as<00:01:22.770> well<00:01:23.119> so<00:01:24.119> that's

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
decomposing stuff as well so that's

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.109 
decomposing stuff as well so that's
where<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.229> difficulty<00:01:25.890> comes<00:01:26.220> in<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.970> last

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
where the difficulty comes in the last

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.899 
where the difficulty comes in the last
one<00:01:27.330> there<00:01:27.450> says<00:01:27.689> scavengers<00:01:28.259> make<00:01:28.470> food<00:01:28.860> for

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
one there says scavengers make food for

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:31.670 
one there says scavengers make food for
decomposers<00:01:29.909> while<00:01:30.659> decomposers<00:01:31.350> make

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
decomposers while decomposers make

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.370 
decomposers while decomposers make
nutrients<00:01:32.159> for<00:01:32.310> plants<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.700> animals<00:01:32.869> so<00:01:33.869> like

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
nutrients for plants and animals so like

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.399 
nutrients for plants and animals so like
a<00:01:34.409> mushroom<00:01:35.189> sitting<00:01:35.790> on<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:35.909> old<00:01:36.270> old<00:01:37.049> log

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
a mushroom sitting on a old old log

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.969 
a mushroom sitting on a old old log
that's<00:01:37.950> falling<00:01:38.369> down<00:01:38.400> is<00:01:38.820> dead<00:01:39.979> mushroom

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
that's falling down is dead mushroom

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.429 
that's falling down is dead mushroom
will<00:01:41.220> break<00:01:41.520> that<00:01:41.759> material<00:01:42.390> down<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:42.990> put

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
will break that material down and put

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.410 
will break that material down and put
those<00:01:43.560> nutrients<00:01:44.159> back<00:01:44.220> in<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.549> ground<00:01:44.850> for

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
those nutrients back in the ground for

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.069 
those nutrients back in the ground for
other<00:01:46.079> plants<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:47.040> grow<00:01:47.509> worms<00:01:48.509> and

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
other plants to grow worms and

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.600 
other plants to grow worms and
millipedes<00:01:50.000> are<00:01:51.290> considered<00:01:52.610> decomposers

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
millipedes are considered decomposers

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.090 
millipedes are considered decomposers
even<00:01:54.210> though<00:01:54.450> they<00:01:54.689> are<00:01:54.869> animal<00:01:55.860> type

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
even though they are animal type

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.289 
even though they are animal type
organisms<00:01:56.700> they<00:01:57.360> are<00:01:57.509> insects<00:01:58.020> they<00:01:58.320> are

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
organisms they are insects they are

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:03.440 
organisms they are insects they are
analysts<00:02:00.299> so<00:02:01.159> those<00:02:02.159> two<00:02:02.460> creatures<00:02:02.939> are<00:02:03.420> also

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
analysts so those two creatures are also

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.249 
analysts so those two creatures are also
considered<00:02:04.140> decomposer<00:02:04.560> because<00:02:04.920> they

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
considered decomposer because they

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:10.609 
considered decomposer because they
consume<00:02:08.030> dead<00:02:09.030> material<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:09.869> then<00:02:10.170> their

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
consume dead material and then their

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.640 
consume dead material and then their
waste<00:02:10.979> product<00:02:11.510> fertilizes<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.690> soil

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
waste product fertilizes the soil

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.110 
waste product fertilizes the soil
worms<00:02:13.890> more<00:02:14.220> than<00:02:14.400> anything<00:02:14.579> because<00:02:14.819> they're

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
worms more than anything because they're

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.940 
worms more than anything because they're
usually<00:02:15.540> found<00:02:15.900> underground<00:02:16.140> eating

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
usually found underground eating

flies all the way up to turkey vultures
so<00:02:29.459> large<00:02:30.209> animals<00:02:30.659> like<00:02:30.810> that<00:02:30.840> now<00:02:31.829> here's

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
so large animals like that now here's

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.729 
so large animals like that now here's
the<00:02:32.819> quiz<00:02:33.060> I'm<00:02:33.750> gonna<00:02:33.930> go<00:02:34.079> to<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.290> next<00:02:34.319> slides

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
the quiz I'm gonna go to the next slides

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.770 
the quiz I'm gonna go to the next slides
and<00:02:35.159> your<00:02:35.370> job<00:02:35.549> is<00:02:35.819> trying<00:02:36.090> to<00:02:36.180> figure<00:02:36.450> out<00:02:36.480> if

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
and your job is trying to figure out if

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.830 
and your job is trying to figure out if
you<00:02:36.930> think<00:02:36.989> the<00:02:37.409> animal<00:02:37.829> is<00:02:37.980> a<00:02:38.370> scavenger<00:02:39.299> or<00:02:39.780> a

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
you think the animal is a scavenger or a

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.429 
you think the animal is a scavenger or a
decomposer

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:42.439 
decomposer

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:45.080 
decomposer
so<00:02:43.439> this<00:02:43.590> first<00:02:43.829> animal<00:02:44.189> as<00:02:44.310> you<00:02:44.790> can<00:02:44.909> read

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
so this first animal as you can read

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.569 
so this first animal as you can read
there<00:02:45.329> is<00:02:45.420> a<00:02:45.450> hyena<00:02:45.959> and<00:02:46.319> he's<00:02:46.889> got<00:02:47.040> an<00:02:47.129> example

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
there is a hyena and he's got an example

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:49.699 
there is a hyena and he's got an example
of<00:02:47.700> a<00:02:47.819> dead<00:02:48.090> carcass<00:02:48.420> in<00:02:48.720> his<00:02:48.840> mouth<00:02:49.049> it's

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
of a dead carcass in his mouth it's

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.849 
of a dead carcass in his mouth it's
pretty<00:02:49.980> cool<00:02:50.239> so<00:02:51.239> what<00:02:51.659> do<00:02:51.720> you<00:02:51.870> think<00:02:52.139> pause

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
here think about it were you right it's

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:03.830 
here think about it were you right it's

over all these little pieces of dead
leaves<00:04:41.760> and<00:04:42.240> such<00:04:43.160> think<00:04:44.160> about<00:04:44.340> what<00:04:44.460> it<00:04:44.550> eats

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:44.729 
leaves and such think about what it eats

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:46.730 
leaves and such think about what it eats
and<00:04:45.150> think<00:04:45.900> about<00:04:46.080> what<00:04:46.229> it<00:04:46.320> does<00:04:46.500> with<00:04:46.710> that

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
and think about what it does with that

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.159 
and think about what it does with that
do<00:04:47.550> you<00:04:47.729> think<00:04:47.940> is<00:04:48.180> a<00:04:48.210> scavenger<00:04:48.900> or<00:04:49.050> a

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.169 
do you think is a scavenger or a

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:52.689 
do you think is a scavenger or a
decomposer

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:52.699 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:05:01.070 

there<00:04:53.699> you<00:04:53.820> go<00:04:58.669> yeah<00:04:59.669> I<00:04:59.700> was<00:05:00.060> wrong<00:05:00.330> I<00:05:00.720> had<00:05:00.990> the

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
there you go yeah I was wrong I had the

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.440 
there you go yeah I was wrong I had the
wrong<00:05:01.260> slide<00:05:01.620> it's<00:05:02.340> actually<00:05:02.760> a<00:05:02.790> decomposer

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.450 
wrong slide it's actually a decomposer

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:07.520 
wrong slide it's actually a decomposer
because<00:05:04.110> all<00:05:04.260> it<00:05:04.410> does<00:05:04.620> is<00:05:05.930> slime<00:05:06.930> over<00:05:07.260> stuff

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
because all it does is slime over stuff

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.280 
because all it does is slime over stuff
and<00:05:07.770> eat<00:05:08.130> the<00:05:08.280> dead<00:05:08.460> things<00:05:08.729> and<00:05:09.030> then<00:05:09.360> those

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:10.290 
and eat the dead things and then those

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:14.469 
and eat the dead things and then those
nutrients<00:05:10.830> go<00:05:10.919> back<00:05:11.100> into<00:05:11.250> the<00:05:11.340> ground

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:14.479 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:18.529 

the<00:05:15.479> next<00:05:15.720> one<00:05:15.840> is<00:05:15.960> bacteria<00:05:17.539> microscopic

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:18.539 
the next one is bacteria microscopic

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:21.529 
the next one is bacteria microscopic
little<00:05:19.080> creatures<00:05:19.669> that<00:05:20.669> are<00:05:21.000> eating<00:05:21.360> there

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:21.539 
little creatures that are eating there

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:24.230 
little creatures that are eating there
what<00:05:22.440> do<00:05:22.530> you<00:05:22.590> think<00:05:23.060> scavenger<00:05:24.060> or

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
what do you think scavenger or

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.879 
what do you think scavenger or
decomposer

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:27.889 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:30.770 

did<00:05:28.889> you<00:05:29.010> guess<00:05:29.160> that<00:05:29.190> one<00:05:29.580> right<00:05:29.789> you're

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:30.780 
did you guess that one right you're

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.700 
did you guess that one right you're
right<00:05:31.050> the<00:05:31.380> decomposer

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:33.710 
right the decomposer

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:39.050 
right the decomposer
now<00:05:34.710> these<00:05:35.130> are<00:05:35.520> large<00:05:36.479> buzzards<00:05:37.440> or<00:05:37.910> condors

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 
now these are large buzzards or condors

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.750 
now these are large buzzards or condors
oh<00:05:39.680> it<00:05:40.680> says<00:05:40.800> vulture<00:05:41.160> right<00:05:41.340> there<00:05:41.520> so<00:05:41.669> I

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:41.760 
oh it says vulture right there so I

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.730 
oh it says vulture right there so I
guess<00:05:41.910> it's<00:05:42.060> a<00:05:42.120> vulture<00:05:42.380> what<00:05:43.380> do<00:05:43.440> you<00:05:43.530> think

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
guess it's a vulture what do you think

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:52.040 
guess it's a vulture what do you think
scavenger<00:05:44.550> or<00:05:44.729> decomposer<00:05:50.660> yep<00:05:51.660> you<00:05:51.930> were

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
scavenger or decomposer yep you were

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:53.839 
scavenger or decomposer yep you were
right<00:05:52.320> it<00:05:52.919> was<00:05:52.979> probably<00:05:53.370> a<00:05:53.460> little<00:05:53.639> more

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:53.849 
right it was probably a little more

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:55.370 
right it was probably a little more
obvious<00:05:53.970> because<00:05:54.240> of<00:05:54.479> the<00:05:54.599> dead<00:05:55.050> carcass

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 
obvious because of the dead carcass

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.550 
obvious because of the dead carcass
there<00:05:55.770> in<00:05:55.919> the<00:05:56.010> middle<00:05:56.220> and<00:05:57.260> here's<00:05:58.260> the<00:05:58.380> last

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 
there in the middle and here's the last

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:58.940 
there in the middle and here's the last
one

00:05:58.940 --> 00:05:58.950 
one

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:02.480 
one
wood<00:05:59.700> lice<00:06:00.000> you<00:06:00.450> guys<00:06:01.200> looking<00:06:02.190> at<00:06:02.280> them<00:06:02.430> they

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490 
wood lice you guys looking at them they

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.070 
wood lice you guys looking at them they
kind<00:06:02.880> of<00:06:02.910> look<00:06:03.030> like<00:06:03.060> roly<00:06:03.389> poly<00:06:03.690> so<00:06:03.960> they're

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 
kind of look like roly poly so they're

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.250 
kind of look like roly poly so they're
kind<00:06:04.410> of<00:06:04.470> a<00:06:04.590> same<00:06:05.250> family<00:06:05.940> as<00:06:06.060> that<00:06:06.270> they<00:06:07.020> are

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:07.260 
kind of a same family as that they are

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.040 
kind of a same family as that they are
kind<00:06:08.220> of<00:06:08.310> munching<00:06:08.820> away<00:06:08.910> here<00:06:09.240> on<00:06:09.270> a<00:06:09.419> dead<00:06:09.720> log

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.050 
kind of munching away here on a dead log

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.760 
kind of munching away here on a dead log
so<00:06:10.860> what<00:06:11.039> do<00:06:11.099> you<00:06:11.190> think<00:06:11.510> scavenger<00:06:12.510> or

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:12.770 
so what do you think scavenger or

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.070 
so what do you think scavenger or
decomposer

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:15.080 
decomposer

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.740 
decomposer
yep<00:06:16.080> that's<00:06:16.530> correct

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:17.750 
yep that's correct

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:21.170 
yep that's correct
all<00:06:18.750> right<00:06:18.960> so<00:06:19.200> good<00:06:19.440> job<00:06:19.710> guys<00:06:20.039> and<00:06:20.370> hopefully

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.180 
all right so good job guys and hopefully

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:22.879 
all right so good job guys and hopefully
you<00:06:21.539> understand<00:06:22.050> now<00:06:22.260> a<00:06:22.289> little<00:06:22.560> bit<00:06:22.770> better

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:22.889 
you understand now a little bit better

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:25.310 
you understand now a little bit better
