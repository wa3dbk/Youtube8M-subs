false and you see a little drop-down
comes<00:01:41.880> up<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.270> we<00:01:42.360> want<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.570> change<00:01:42.689> false<00:01:43.110> to

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
comes up and we want to change false to

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.749 
comes up and we want to change false to
true<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.689> then<00:01:45.689> we<00:01:46.290> want<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.590> go<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:47.100> loop<00:01:47.340> to

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
true and then we want to go to loop to

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.410 
true and then we want to go to loop to
say<00:01:47.909> instead<00:01:48.149> of<00:01:48.270> true<00:01:48.570> we<00:01:48.990> want<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.229> say<00:01:49.409> false

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
say instead of true we want to say false

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.539 
say instead of true we want to say false
now<00:01:51.420> this<00:01:52.200> is<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.409> most<00:01:52.590> important<00:01:53.100> part<00:01:53.130> is

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
now this is the most important part is

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.450 
now this is the most important part is
we<00:01:53.790> want<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.090> put<00:01:54.299> in<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.600> path<00:01:54.930> or<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.470> file

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
we want to put in the path or the file

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.399 
we want to put in the path or the file
path<00:01:56.759> basically<00:01:57.479> where<00:01:57.719> your<00:01:57.899> computer<00:01:58.320> is

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
path basically where your computer is

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.200 
path basically where your computer is
locally<00:01:58.829> where<00:01:58.979> your<00:01:59.130> program<00:01:59.490> is<00:01:59.670> located

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
locally where your program is located

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.179 
locally where your program is located
where<00:02:00.240> this<00:02:00.450> file<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:01.469> splash<00:02:01.710> file<00:02:01.979> is

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
where this file the splash file is

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.090 
where this file the splash file is
located<00:02:02.399> we<00:02:03.210> want<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.479> put<00:02:03.659> that<00:02:03.810> in<00:02:04.020> so<00:02:04.530> i<00:02:04.829> did

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
earlier i went and just copy the path

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.830 
earlier i went and just copy the path
from<00:02:07.469> from<00:02:08.369> my<00:02:08.759> documents<00:02:09.239> where<00:02:09.390> it<00:02:09.479> was<00:02:09.629> and
