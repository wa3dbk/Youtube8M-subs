why am I getting this but basically I

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.259 
why am I getting this but basically I
will<00:00:26.699> be<00:00:26.760> using<00:00:26.910> this<00:00:27.180> for<00:00:27.480> video<00:00:27.779> editing<00:00:28.260> and

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:29.269 
will be using this for video editing and

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:34.400 
will be using this for video editing and
but<00:00:30.269> this<00:00:30.449> is<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:31.130> core<00:00:32.130> i7<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:33.200> and<00:00:34.200> this<00:00:34.350> is

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
but this is the core i7 and and this is

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.030 
but this is the core i7 and and this is
a<00:00:34.530> full<00:00:34.739> fledged<00:00:35.090> Macintosh<00:00:36.090> computer<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:37.040> if

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
a full fledged Macintosh computer and if

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.860 
a full fledged Macintosh computer and if
you<00:00:38.190> notice<00:00:38.430> it's<00:00:38.579> pretty<00:00:38.850> small<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.540> give<00:00:39.780> you

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
you notice it's pretty small to give you

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.530 
you notice it's pretty small to give you
an<00:00:39.989> idea<00:00:40.260> for<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.160> full<00:00:41.399> fledged<00:00:41.670> core<00:00:42.059> i7

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
an idea for a full fledged core i7

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.360 
an idea for a full fledged core i7
computer<00:00:43.190> this<00:00:44.190> is<00:00:44.250> my<00:00:44.520> HTC<00:00:45.149> One<00:00:45.390> m8<00:00:45.750> so<00:00:46.739> as<00:00:47.190> you

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
computer this is my HTC One m8 so as you

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.549 
computer this is my HTC One m8 so as you
can<00:00:47.489> see<00:00:47.870> slightly<00:00:48.870> bigger<00:00:49.079> looks<00:00:49.350> like<00:00:49.530> a

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
can see slightly bigger looks like a

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.490 
can see slightly bigger looks like a
bigger<00:00:50.520> different<00:00:51.059> box<00:00:51.270> if<00:00:51.899> I<00:00:52.110> would<00:00:52.289> say

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
bigger different box if I would say

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.110 
bigger different box if I would say
before<00:00:53.370> that<00:00:53.489> let's<00:00:53.699> look<00:00:53.850> at<00:00:54.000> the

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
before that let's look at the

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.889 
before that let's look at the
accessories<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:54.660> we<00:00:55.050> get<00:00:56.420> we<00:00:57.420> have<00:00:57.629> this

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
accessories that we get we have this

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
open this one and I guess some manuals

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.039 
open this one and I guess some manuals
and<00:01:07.200> stickers<00:01:07.979> we<00:01:08.130> might<00:01:08.340> get<00:01:08.610> we<00:01:09.270> say<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:09.720> says

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049

is interesting but I also did purchase
this<00:01:52.680> local<00:01:53.780> DisplayPort

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
this local DisplayPort

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.530 
this local DisplayPort
to<00:01:55.500> mini<00:01:56.189> DisplayPort<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:56.880> regular<00:01:57.240> display

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.300 
to mini DisplayPort to regular display
port<00:01:57.780> cable<00:01:57.990> purchase<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.070> separately

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
port cable purchase it separately

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.760 
port cable purchase it separately
because<00:02:00.000> my<00:02:00.420> monitor<00:02:00.810> has<00:02:01.020> DisplayPort

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
because my monitor has DisplayPort

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.359 
because my monitor has DisplayPort
support<00:02:03.079> let's<00:02:04.079> and<00:02:04.710> this<00:02:04.890> is<00:02:05.009> nothing<00:02:05.340> but

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
support let's and this is nothing but

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.469 
support let's and this is nothing but
just<00:02:05.909> a<00:02:06.500> standard<00:02:07.500> power<00:02:08.069> cable<00:02:08.729> so<00:02:09.179> let's

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
just a standard power cable so let's

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.419 
just a standard power cable so let's
look<00:02:09.660> at<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.989> Mac

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.520 
look at the Mac
let's<00:02:11.060> keep<00:02:11.329> all<00:02:11.540> these<00:02:11.689> things<00:02:11.989> to<00:02:12.140> the<00:02:12.260> side

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
let's keep all these things to the side

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:49.849 
open this to access the memory we can

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:52.089 
open this to access the memory we can
upgrade<00:03:50.180> the<00:03:50.509> memory<00:03:50.629> ourself<00:03:51.409> if<00:03:51.650> required

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:52.099

on<00:03:52.819> the<00:03:53.060> front<00:03:53.269> again<00:03:53.389> it's<00:03:53.720> minimalistic<00:03:54.680> I

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
on the front again it's minimalistic I

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.749 
on the front again it's minimalistic I
think<00:03:56.090> so<00:03:56.150> this<00:03:56.299> is<00:03:56.449> the<00:03:56.569> IR<00:03:56.900> blaster<00:03:57.349> and<00:03:57.759> this

00:03:58.749 --> 00:03:58.759 
think so this is the IR blaster and this

00:03:58.759 --> 00:04:01.089 
think so this is the IR blaster and this
is<00:03:58.909> the<00:03:59.030> LED<00:03:59.269> this<00:03:59.449> will<00:03:59.629> glow<00:03:59.810> when<00:04:00.049> the<00:04:00.229> Mac

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:01.099 
is the LED this will glow when the Mac

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:04.659 
is the LED this will glow when the Mac
Mini<00:04:01.129> is<00:04:01.669> on<00:04:02.319> so<00:04:03.319> that's<00:04:03.709> it<00:04:03.889> for<00:04:04.040> now<00:04:04.099> for<00:04:04.489> this

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:04.669 
Mini is on so that's it for now for this

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:08.800 
Mini is on so that's it for now for this
