 aemet microprocessors 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.669
 after having successfully marketed the k you dis 

00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:15.039
 the amd firm has evolved and brought to market other processors 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:18.089
 more modern and sophisticated 

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:23.619
 we could group in three large groups these new microprocessors of 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:24.859
 to md 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:26.189
 so we have

 aemme de dur칩n a md a tono was going to md apro xp 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:36.199
 the primitos the processors to md dur칩n has very good relation 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:37.850
 price quality 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.350
 and as its own name indicates no 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.480
 They are built to last and adapt to the future 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:50.240
 currently they comprise a range that goes from 700 megahertz to 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:56.110
 thousand 300 megahertz the microprocessors to md durig belong 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.470
 to the low range of a md and constitute 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.520
 a complement al칩s I admired C치ceres

 a md durr are a derivation of the countries mede ap no 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.420
 they have a 200 megahertz front bus 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.659
 and include the instructions three of nou 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.340
 optimized and an integrated cache inside the package of the 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.030
 micro 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.630
 aemme de heathrow little 7 parents average astarloa coca seven are 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.220
 high-end microprocessors 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.650
 with which md competes at par with inter possess a front bus with 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.429
 speeds of 200 by 266 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:40.970

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:47.840
 with the atoll there are thousands has replaced the sotet 7 by the socket ay he is what 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:48.610
 other 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:54.539
 integrates a mathematical coprocessor that by using teti phelan techniques 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:57.659
 significantly improves the floating point calculations 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:02.339
 the techniques of pipe the inc divide the execution of an instruction 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.170
 in a certain number of totally independent phases 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.129
 from one another 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:14.590
 This technique of you the hinco makes possible the almost simultaneous execution 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.309
 of two commas instructions 

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:24.079
 Posse a built-in 1 cache memory inside the 128's micro package 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:25.059
 kilobits 

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:28.869
 compared to the 64 kilobytes that they had 

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:31.869
 the pantheons d products in addition to 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:39.499
 the cache memory l2 pode second level is 256 kilos valley 

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:45.649
 in terms of internal speed of the microprocessor there is a range that goes 

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:50.249
 from 500 to 750 megahertz 

00:02:50.249 --> 00:02:54.229
 using an andes technology 0 25 microns 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:03:00.840
 there is another lady that goes from 750 to 1 as the 2 gigahertz 

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:05.150
 using a technology of 0 18 thousand faces 

00:03:05.749 --> 00:03:09.010
 It has 22 million transistors inside 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:13.279
 in addition to the mmx instructions 

00:03:13.279 --> 00:03:18.150
 has integrated the three nou improved instructions 

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:24.419
 It has incorporated a technology that allows the multi process 

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:28.609
 allowing the use of two processors in the same board 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:33.229
 these models are distinguished by the acronym mt 

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:36.249
 to md to tone xp 

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:41.799
 the microprocessors attached xp represented until recently 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.570
 the most evolved products of admired 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:49.789
 they have an architecture pitt amounts 

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:50.870
 and integra 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.529
 the most modern technologies that enable them 

00:03:54.529 --> 00:03:59.559
 for the most demanding applications, especially multimedia 

00:03:59.559 --> 00:04:03.439
 being prepared not only for the current software 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:05.719
 but for the future 

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:11.620
 although palmieri xp work well with any operating system they are 

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:14.809
 specially designed for windows xp 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:18.899
 with which their capabilities reach maximum performance 

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:25.810
 they have a high-performance, high-performance cache of 380 

00:04:25.809 --> 00:04:27.499
 kilos worth 

00:04:27.499 --> 00:04:32.409
 have an advanced 266 megahertz front-side bus 

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:34.570
 with efe efe support 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:35.449
 that is to say 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:38.919
 error correction code 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:44.259
 It has a professional technology three of nou fully compatible with the 

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:45.349
 instructions 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:47.180
 H.H 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.659
 uses as a socket the sotet to 

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:54.819
 has support for memory before errors ie double memory 

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:56.710
 speed 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.270
 integrates 37 'inside with 5 million transistors 

00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:05.889
 and uses a technology in 0 18 thousand faces 

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:10.009
 the acronym xp refers to high performance 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:16.050
 that the cusp papers have with the operating system windows xp 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:24.659
 there is a range that goes from the thousand 500 plus to the 3 thousand 200 more 

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:25.960
 these numbers 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.960
 they do not indicate the real frequency of the micro but the comparative superiority 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.889
 with the models of interest 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:34.939
 whose internal speed 

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:39.310
 is equal to the absolute value of the number indicated by the model xp 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:44.129
 so for example one m high or one thousand 900 more 

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:49.370
 they have an international top performance speed yet a thousand pentium 

00:05:49.369 --> 00:05:50.789
 900 megahertz
