 other participants 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.300
 and Podolski 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.630
 that's the way it works 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.429
 as you know him in the national team 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:28.810
 nice slow in the early summer 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.720
 in the analysis with the corresponding markers who wants already north 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:33.969
 had predicted 

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:37.710
 Playing on the outside position results in many possibilities many 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.690
 Spaces of the title image Goal

 for Podolski, we are now making wonderful here 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.460
 In addition, gunners encounter this pass from Ozil that is 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.550
 he does not want to exaggerate that he is still completely confused 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.040
 but the pass was already great 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.040
 and percent Miro does that 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.770
 this 1 0 then in hell few of the DAX opened the whole game over that 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.510
 everything also prophesies if you have the 1 0 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.950
 would fall then the German team would be hard to hold 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.500
 We would have tribal elders in the 76th minute through Marius 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.090
 fries 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.640

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.650
 June found Rades pursue with interest

 the Borussia Dortmund have lost the Bayern after but in would Â»Dr 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:38.649
 this time it's a pretty good game 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.360
 first here 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.060
 and he is happy that Holger is not known exactly but almost as 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.060

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.030
 to 16 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.470
 In general, a pregnancy knew that I am still the liberal 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.120

 No, I can say that had criticized him 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.860
 So we have his defensive work a little criticized but forward has 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.870
 is working quite well Lukas Podolski with the three to zero we all drink 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.870
 his critics also silenced so two solid 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.159
 he does it himself 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:29.459
 it does not want to 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:30.779
 we have to see 

00:02:30.779 --> 00:02:33.339

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:42.359
