here in the picture but I'm going to
talk<00:00:31.490> about<00:00:31.610> the<00:00:31.760> other<00:00:31.850> ones<00:00:32.090> and<00:00:32.270> how<00:00:32.390> a<00:00:32.690> lot

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 
talk about the other ones and how a lot

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.369 
talk about the other ones and how a lot
of<00:00:33.320> the<00:00:33.470> command<00:00:33.830> line<00:00:33.890> interface<00:00:35.379> commands

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:36.379 
of the command line interface commands

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:39.130 
of the command line interface commands
can<00:00:36.800> kind<00:00:37.129> of<00:00:37.190> translate<00:00:37.730> between<00:00:37.940> all<00:00:38.570> the

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
can kind of translate between all the

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.330 
can kind of translate between all the
different<00:00:39.170> gateways<00:00:39.680> now<00:00:40.070> there's<00:00:40.250> a

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
different gateways now there's a

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.400 
different gateways now there's a
significant<00:00:40.970> difference<00:00:41.239> between<00:00:41.270> the<00:00:41.480> g700

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
significant difference between the g700

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.240 
significant difference between the g700
and<00:00:42.530> the<00:00:43.190> g4<00:00:43.670> 30s<00:00:44.120> and<00:00:44.449> g4<00:00:45.110> 50s<00:00:45.440> and<00:00:45.650> 350s<00:00:46.129> and

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
and the g4 30s and g4 50s and 350s and

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.079 
and the g4 30s and g4 50s and 350s and
things<00:00:46.400> like<00:00:46.489> that<00:00:46.550> because<00:00:46.790> they<00:00:47.059> are

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:47.089 
things like that because they are

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:49.840 
things like that because they are
different<00:00:47.750> they're<00:00:47.900> newer<00:00:48.190> but<00:00:49.190> pretty<00:00:49.699> much

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
different they're newer but pretty much

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.610 
different they're newer but pretty much
once<00:00:50.089> you<00:00:50.180> get<00:00:50.360> into<00:00:50.510> each<00:00:50.720> of<00:00:50.900> the<00:00:50.989> platforms

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
once you get into each of the platforms

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.500 
once you get into each of the platforms
of<00:00:52.400> the<00:00:52.460> system<00:00:53.379> you'll<00:00:54.379> be<00:00:54.440> able<00:00:54.710> to<00:00:55.510> navigate

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
of the system you'll be able to navigate

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.840 
of the system you'll be able to navigate
yourself<00:00:56.839> navigate<00:00:57.500> away<00:00:57.670> navigate<00:00:58.670> around

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
yourself navigate away navigate around

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.789 
yourself navigate away navigate around
them<00:00:59.330> pretty<00:00:59.629> easily<00:00:59.839> once<00:01:00.170> I<00:01:00.379> get<00:01:00.559> through<00:01:00.769> a

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:00.799 
them pretty easily once I get through a

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:02.500 
them pretty easily once I get through a
lot<00:01:00.979> of<00:01:01.040> this<00:01:01.190> I'm<00:01:01.640> not<00:01:01.760> going<00:01:01.909> to<00:01:01.970> go<00:01:02.059> over<00:01:02.360> all

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
lot of this I'm not going to go over all

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.180 
lot of this I'm not going to go over all
of<00:01:02.540> the<00:01:03.019> commands<00:01:03.500> but<00:01:03.680> I<00:01:03.710> am<00:01:03.860> going<00:01:03.979> to<00:01:04.070> go

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
of the commands but I am going to go

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.710 
of the commands but I am going to go
over<00:01:04.220> a<00:01:04.370> number<00:01:04.519> of<00:01:04.640> them<00:01:04.879> that<00:01:05.089> are<00:01:05.449> fairly

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
over a number of them that are fairly

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.090 
over a number of them that are fairly
important<00:01:06.200> and<00:01:06.380> I'm<00:01:06.590> going<00:01:06.770> to<00:01:06.799> put<00:01:06.979> some

anything else to use you can use a sa to

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.070 
anything else to use you can use a sa to

being that this is a g700 I think I'm

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.440 
being that this is a g700 I think I'm
4.1<00:01:51.410> that's<00:01:51.830> 69<00:01:52.550> or<00:01:52.580> something<00:01:53.210> I<00:01:53.270> don't<00:01:53.330> know

commands<00:01:55.490> but<00:01:55.930> you<00:01:56.930> can<00:01:57.050> see<00:01:57.200> you<00:01:57.290> can<00:01:57.409> get

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
commands but you can see you can get

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.100 
commands but you can see you can get
into<00:01:57.650> the<00:01:57.740> bash<00:01:57.890> part<00:01:58.280> of<00:01:58.370> the<00:01:59.110> Definity

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
into the bash part of the Definity

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.050 
into the bash part of the Definity
itself<00:02:00.500> for<00:02:00.680> the<00:02:00.740> communication<00:02:01.340> the<00:02:01.490> CM<00:02:01.850> the

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
itself for the communication the CM the

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.149 
itself for the communication the CM the
scene<00:02:02.270> of<00:02:02.390> the<00:02:02.480> communication<00:02:03.050> manager<00:02:03.409> I<00:02:03.560> can

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
scene of the communication manager I can

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:06.460 
scene of the communication manager I can
get<00:02:04.370> in<00:02:04.460> the<00:02:04.550> MGP<00:02:04.880> media<00:02:05.720> gate<00:02:05.840> or<00:02:05.990> processor

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
get in the MGP media gate or processor

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.589 
get in the MGP media gate or processor
and<00:02:06.620> I<00:02:06.830> can<00:02:06.979> get<00:02:07.130> into<00:02:07.310> the<00:02:07.430> stack<00:02:07.729> the<00:02:08.000> P<00:02:08.179> 330

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 
and I can get into the stack the P 330

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:11.440 
and I can get into the stack the P 330
stack<00:02:08.959> or<00:02:09.229> the<00:02:09.259> cage<00:02:09.619> inside<00:02:10.039> of<00:02:10.450> these

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
stack or the cage inside of these

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:12.910 
stack or the cage inside of these
gateways<00:02:11.810> because<00:02:12.349> you<00:02:12.470> can<00:02:12.590> use<00:02:12.769> these

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
gateways because you can use these

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.619 
gateways because you can use these
gateways<00:02:13.129> is<00:02:13.400> basically<00:02:13.760> like<00:02:14.030> routers<00:02:14.269> you

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:14.629 
gateways is basically like routers you

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:16.300 
gateways is basically like routers you
can<00:02:14.780> hook<00:02:14.930> DSL<00:02:15.379> lines<00:02:15.590> up<00:02:15.800> to<00:02:15.920> them<00:02:16.040> and<00:02:16.159> things

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
can hook DSL lines up to them and things

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.649 
can hook DSL lines up to them and things
like<00:02:16.430> that<00:02:16.489> so<00:02:16.909> you<00:02:17.060> do<00:02:17.269> some<00:02:17.390> pretty<00:02:17.480> cool

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:17.659 
like that so you do some pretty cool

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:18.789 
like that so you do some pretty cool
stuff<00:02:17.720> with<00:02:18.019> that<00:02:18.230> I<00:02:18.379> can<00:02:18.530> get<00:02:18.620> into<00:02:18.739> that

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:18.799 
stuff with that I can get into that

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:21.039 
stuff with that I can get into that
later<00:02:18.920> with<00:02:19.280> some<00:02:19.400> advanced<00:02:19.700> stuff<00:02:20.030> but<00:02:20.840> you

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:21.049 
later with some advanced stuff but you

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:22.899 
later with some advanced stuff but you
can<00:02:21.170> see<00:02:21.409> you<00:02:22.099> can<00:02:22.219> get<00:02:22.310> into<00:02:22.519> each<00:02:22.639> of<00:02:22.790> your

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:22.909 
can see you can get into each of your

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:24.400 
can see you can get into each of your
items<00:02:23.030> you<00:02:23.269> also<00:02:23.480> can<00:02:23.749> get<00:02:23.870> in<00:02:23.989> the<00:02:24.079> void

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
items you also can get in the void

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.330 
items you also can get in the void
engine<00:02:24.620> but<00:02:24.770> that's<00:02:24.920> pretty<00:02:25.160> much<00:02:25.280> for

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
engine but that's pretty much for

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.770 
engine but that's pretty much for
developers<00:02:25.940> to<00:02:26.150> be<00:02:26.240> able<00:02:26.270> to<00:02:26.450> do<00:02:26.570> debugging

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
developers to be able to do debugging

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.860 
developers to be able to do debugging
and<00:02:27.350> I<00:02:28.070> lost<00:02:28.430> my<00:02:28.580> password<00:02:28.880> so<00:02:29.360> I<00:02:29.540> don't<00:02:29.780> know

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
and I lost my password so I don't know

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.470 
and I lost my password so I don't know
the<00:02:29.960> craft<00:02:30.080> password<00:02:30.560> anymore<00:02:31.330> and<00:02:32.330> I<00:02:32.390> don't

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
the craft password anymore and I don't

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.750 
the craft password anymore and I don't
care<00:02:32.750> because<00:02:32.900> I<00:02:33.380> have<00:02:34.010> other<00:02:34.190> items<00:02:34.400> that<00:02:34.640> I

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
care because I have other items that I

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.960 
care because I have other items that I
can<00:02:34.970> check<00:02:35.270> for<00:02:35.350> VoIP<00:02:36.350> statistics<00:02:37.280> alright<00:02:37.760> so

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
can check for VoIP statistics alright so

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.430 
can check for VoIP statistics alright so
there<00:02:38.120> you<00:02:38.240> go<00:02:38.360> I'm<00:02:38.900> going<00:02:39.110> to<00:02:39.170> show<00:02:39.290> you<00:02:39.350> each

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
there you go I'm going to show you each

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.740 
there you go I'm going to show you each
of<00:02:39.710> these<00:02:39.770> but<00:02:40.190> what<00:02:40.790> you<00:02:40.910> basically<00:02:41.090> do<00:02:41.480> to

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
of these but what you basically do to

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.210 
of these but what you basically do to
set<00:02:41.990> these<00:02:42.170> up<00:02:42.410> is<00:02:43.420> you<00:02:44.420> go<00:02:44.630> in<00:02:44.780> here

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
set these up is you go in here

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.450 
set these up is you go in here
properties<00:02:47.110> log<00:02:48.110> in<00:02:48.380> just<00:02:48.590> log<00:02:48.980> in<00:02:49.130> manually

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:49.460 
properties log in just log in manually

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:50.650 
properties log in just log in manually
because<00:02:49.640> it's<00:02:49.760> going<00:02:49.880> to<00:02:49.970> bring<00:02:50.060> up<00:02:50.180> the<00:02:50.300> blue

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
because it's going to bring up the blue

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.030 
because it's going to bring up the blue
screen<00:02:50.960> as<00:02:51.140> you<00:02:51.260> can<00:02:51.380> see<00:02:51.560> when<00:02:51.710> we<00:02:51.740> start

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
screen as you can see when we start

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.340 
screen as you can see when we start
logging<00:02:52.190> in<00:02:52.460> but<00:02:53.180> you<00:02:53.420> put<00:02:53.600> it<00:02:53.690> on<00:02:53.780> port<00:02:54.050> 23

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
logging in but you put it on port 23

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.040 
logging in but you put it on port 23
whatever<00:02:54.890> the<00:02:55.010> IP<00:02:55.400> address<00:02:55.850> is<00:02:56.030> in<00:02:56.210> port<00:02:56.630> 23

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
whatever the IP address is in port 23

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.100 
whatever the IP address is in port 23
which<00:02:57.560> is<00:02:57.710> for<00:02:57.890> telnet<00:02:58.070> alright<00:02:59.060> so<00:02:59.660> you<00:02:59.960> can

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
which is for telnet alright so you can

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.840 
which is for telnet alright so you can
use<00:03:00.230> your<00:03:00.560> regular<00:03:00.710> telnet<00:03:01.130> window<00:03:01.490> or<00:03:01.700> you

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
use your regular telnet window or you

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.100 
use your regular telnet window or you
can<00:03:01.970> just<00:03:02.090> use<00:03:02.240> everything<00:03:02.600> right<00:03:02.750> out<00:03:02.780> of<00:03:02.930> a

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
can just use everything right out of a

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.920 
can just use everything right out of a
sa<00:03:03.410> like<00:03:03.590> I<00:03:03.740> do<00:03:04.090> much<00:03:05.090> easier<00:03:05.450> that<00:03:05.600> way

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
sa like I do much easier that way

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.490 
sa like I do much easier that way
alright<00:03:06.170> so<00:03:07.300> let's<00:03:08.300> start<00:03:08.720> with<00:03:08.930> the<00:03:09.200> bash

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
alright so let's start with the bash

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.780 
alright so let's start with the bash
command<00:03:09.920> actually<00:03:10.070> let<00:03:10.310> me<00:03:10.370> close<00:03:10.550> all<00:03:10.700> the

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
command actually let me close all the

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.570 
command actually let me close all the
windows<00:03:11.140> start<00:03:12.140> fresh<00:03:12.380> alright<00:03:12.860> so<00:03:13.490> you<00:03:13.550> can

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
windows start fresh alright so you can

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.910 
windows start fresh alright so you can
see<00:03:13.670> my<00:03:13.910> connections<00:03:14.390> here<00:03:14.570> I'm<00:03:15.320> going<00:03:15.770> to<00:03:15.830> go

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
see my connections here I'm going to go

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.470 
see my connections here I'm going to go
into<00:03:16.130> the<00:03:16.220> bash<00:03:16.400> so<00:03:16.730> if<00:03:16.790> I<00:03:16.880> stay<00:03:17.090> start

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
into the bash so if I stay start

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.750 
into the bash so if I stay start
emulation<00:03:18.140> and<00:03:18.380> I<00:03:18.440> will<00:03:18.590> put<00:03:18.740> it<00:03:18.830> up<00:03:18.980> you<00:03:19.580> can

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
emulation and I will put it up you can

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.720 
emulation and I will put it up you can
see<00:03:19.790> my<00:03:19.970> bash<00:03:20.390> in<00:03:20.660> here<00:03:21.170> is<00:03:21.260> connected<00:03:21.800> via<00:03:21.830> 23

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
see my bash in here is connected via 23

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.280 
see my bash in here is connected via 23
and<00:03:23.110> from<00:03:24.110> here<00:03:24.440> you<00:03:25.100> type<00:03:25.490> the<00:03:26.000> admin<00:03:26.570> or<00:03:26.810> your
