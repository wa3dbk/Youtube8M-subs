00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:08.260
 true my channel would have to be called 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:11.140

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:15.220
 another video tutorial about the new 

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:18.890
 iphone 5 ipad mini and ipod charger 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:26.410
 touch 5g good 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:30.370
 here as we can see on the rise 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:35.160
 well here as we can observe 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:40.870
 we have the charger of the new ipod touch 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:42.670
 5g iphone good its features are 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:47.090
 the following 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:50.720
 this new charger 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:52.550
 is smaller than the previous mark the 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.980
 previous connector that we also have it 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:59.620
 over there like not observing 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.289
 it's much smaller 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.590
 and the good thing about the new is that 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:07.720
 can connect the one if you turn it or not 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.850
 I can put it on both sides without 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.310
 But the old one you can not put it 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.850
 just to put on the one hand by which 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.850
 has the drawing this 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.670
 then 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.340
 here we have what is the connection to 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:26.840
 computer but this is the new charger 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:30.520
 light charger that compared to the 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:33.320
 old if we put it together 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.450
 we can observe 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:39.240
 the new one that is this little one that there is 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:44.159
 here this is smaller 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.370
 just like it's finer than 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.650
 this 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.930
 and it's not that it's more resistant or 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.440
 nothing but let's go faster 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.980
 charger 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.030
 Nothing, this is all and one of the 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.100
 wait for the next video tutorial 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.380
