00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 welcome to this ugly act my name is 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:07.400
 David Ordaz and today we will be talking 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.400
 of camera stabilizers ok now 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.150
 today we are going to talk then about 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.160
 stabilizers and why 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.440
 stabilizers good the matter is the 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.960
 next when you're recording something 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.990
 using your camera obviously either a 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.060
 party or a landscape blog or something the 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.310
 lens records the movement of a 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.320
 very sensitive way and some of 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.640
 we who have no new impulse 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.399
 then whenever you're recording 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.560
 even a little bit the camera always 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:40.600
 move and forget if you're trying to 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.030
 walk at the same time to move the 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.340
 camera moves too much in these cases 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:49.270
 It is best to use a stabilizer like 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:52.000
 this something kind like that and in this case you 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.970
 help because it gives you more control over the 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.370
 movement of the camera supporting it in the 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.920
 shoulder and using both hands in this 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.960
 case the camera goes like this a stabilizer 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.900
 how this reduces camera movement 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.940
 up to 80% not 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.490
 like most of the accessories of the 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.440
 video camera and whatever they are 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.030
 quite expensive I gave myself to the task of 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.520
 look for a stabilizer that would 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.840
 economic and I found this then 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.270
 right now I'm going to show you 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.610
 the unboxing of this stabilizer in 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.900
 particular and also some tests that 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.240
 I did using it to see the 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.310
 difference of you making shots with 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:32.810
 stabilizer and without stabilized in ok 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:34.970
 we are going to see the use ok then 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.640
 let's start with the lombok zinc of 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:43.880
 this esther and that although it's called 10 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:46.160
 rl cell 01 and comes in a box 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.119
 pretty cool here in it pretty much the 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.119
 how is it 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:58.270
 does not have much feels good said the 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:00.280
 true when you touch it and have these 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.450
 packages that open type as well as 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.450
 ice creams to the pretty 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:11.289
 then it's a white box opens from a 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.289
 side 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.290
 and in 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.240
 a poster of 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.310
 we are parents can not be used 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.690
 Y 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.690
 i 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:43.549
 It fits well in another one key 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:55.000
 the points 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.690
 all all all want to try 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.590
 I'm going to work 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:02.190
 good after 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:04.590
 and then it is already here what is the 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.390
 apparatus and how it is done well and has folded 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:11.569
 this is a smaller form and that what 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.569
 you can see to go loosening as it has 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:54.700
 and this is where comebacks forgiveness that does not 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.700
 can see to see 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:02.400
 here is how we are going practically like this is 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:08.180
 as nothing comes is that it is super good 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:10.800
 built it feels heavy the two 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.590
 the hard screws of the nuts feel 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.920
 pretty well has good weight and it 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:19.410
 it handles pretty well 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.390
 I'm going to try it, I'm going to do some tests 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.820
 already mounting the camera so that they see them 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:27.020
 but for now an OK purse sale 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.020
 thank you very much 

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:29.259
 Well, I hope you liked it 

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:30.969
 this video about the stabilizers 

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:32.649
 I'll leave you all the information 

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:36.849
 that stabilizer here in the part of 

00:05:32.649 --> 00:05:38.649
 below and also the next video if you 

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:40.659
 you are one of the people that you like to do 

00:05:38.649 --> 00:05:42.999
 your own things and thus save yourself 

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:44.919
 enough money and feel that then the 

00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:47.020
 proud to say is that this I did it 

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:48.580

 stabilizer that is quite versatile and 

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:54.909
 pretty cheap ok I do not know what 

00:05:54.309 --> 00:05:56.679
