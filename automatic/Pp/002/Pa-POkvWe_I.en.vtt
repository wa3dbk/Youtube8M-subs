00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.359 
so the venom as we speak the whole
incident<00:01:13.829> I<00:01:14.100> reckon<00:01:14.460> I'm<00:01:14.700> $86<00:01:15.689> plus<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:16.340> lot<00:01:17.340> of

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
incident I reckon I'm $86 plus a lot of

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.250 
incident I reckon I'm $86 plus a lot of
enemies<00:01:17.820> are<00:01:18.000> looking<00:01:18.990> at<00:01:19.079> the<00:01:19.500> triple<00:01:20.189> digit

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:21.260 
enemies are looking at the triple digit

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.480 
enemies are looking at the triple digit
very<00:01:21.860> soon

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
very soon

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.960 
very soon
how<00:01:24.120> is<00:01:24.409> specifically<00:01:25.409> for<00:01:25.650> you<00:01:25.740> complete<00:01:26.159> how

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
how is specifically for you complete how

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.539 
how is specifically for you complete how
is<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:27.510> boil

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
is I boil

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.050 
is I boil
opening<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.899> company<00:01:31.859> you<00:01:32.820> are<00:01:32.939> the

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
opening the company you are the

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.330 
opening the company you are the
deepwater<00:01:33.450> operations<00:01:34.140> so<00:01:34.439> I<00:01:34.469> think<00:01:34.679> high<00:01:35.159> oil

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
deepwater operations so I think high oil

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.850 
deepwater operations so I think high oil
prices<00:01:35.490> have<00:01:36.060> spurred<00:01:36.840> our<00:01:37.109> companies<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.710> go

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
prices have spurred our companies to go

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.630 
prices have spurred our companies to go
and<00:01:38.219> spend<00:01:38.880> more<00:01:39.090> capex<00:01:40.219> there<00:01:41.219> are<00:01:41.340> companies

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
and spend more capex there are companies

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.109 
and spend more capex there are companies
are<00:01:41.909> also<00:01:42.060> committed<00:01:42.659> far<00:01:43.200> more<00:01:43.380> committed<00:01:43.770> in

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
are also committed far more committed in

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.469 
are also committed far more committed in
developing<00:01:45.119> new<00:01:45.840> oil<00:01:46.140> projects<00:01:46.909> we<00:01:47.909> believe

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
developing new oil projects we believe

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.209 
developing new oil projects we believe
that<00:01:48.750> regardless<00:01:49.229> of<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.590> oil<00:01:49.770> price<00:01:49.890> I<00:01:50.189> think

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:50.219 
that regardless of the oil price I think

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:52.940 
that regardless of the oil price I think
energy<00:01:50.939> demand<00:01:51.420> is<00:01:51.509> going<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.719> go<00:01:51.840> up<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.709> such

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
energy demand is going to go up and such

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.669 
energy demand is going to go up and such
without<00:01:53.700> even<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.060> Opera<00:01:54.360> is<00:01:54.420> getting<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.750> $86

00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:55.679 
without even the Opera is getting to $86

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:57.139 
without even the Opera is getting to $86
I<00:01:55.709> think<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.069> oil<00:01:56.100> companies<00:01:56.640> will<00:01:56.939> take<00:01:57.090> a

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
I think the oil companies will take a

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.819 
I think the oil companies will take a
view<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.569> because<00:01:57.840> of<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.140> increase<00:01:58.619> in

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
view that because of the increase in

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.130 
view that because of the increase in
energy<00:01:58.979> requirement<00:01:59.880> they<00:02:00.420> will<00:02:00.569> continue<00:02:00.840> to

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
energy requirement they will continue to

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.380 
energy requirement they will continue to
look<00:02:01.259> for<00:02:01.560> more<00:02:01.759> sources<00:02:02.759> where<00:02:03.090> they<00:02:03.239> can

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
look for more sources where they can

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.210 
look for more sources where they can
find<00:02:03.569> gas<00:02:03.899> where<00:02:04.380> they<00:02:04.470> can<00:02:04.619> find<00:02:04.860> all<00:02:05.039> in

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
find gas where they can find all in

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.609 
find gas where they can find all in
deeper<00:02:05.489> waters<00:02:05.819> as<00:02:05.939> well<00:02:06.119> so<00:02:06.840> it's<00:02:07.380> extremely

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
deeper waters as well so it's extremely

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.370 
deeper waters as well so it's extremely
well<00:02:08.099> positioned<00:02:08.369> because<00:02:09.299> estrous<00:02:09.780> focuses

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
well positioned because estrous focuses

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.979 
well positioned because estrous focuses
on<00:02:10.530> deep<00:02:10.679> water<00:02:10.709> as<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.340> shallow<00:02:11.549> water<00:02:11.989> the

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
shallow water market gets depleted on

shallow water market gets depleted on
the<00:02:15.750> shallow<00:02:15.930> water<00:02:16.200> fields<00:02:16.560> get<00:02:16.709> depleted

the shallow water fields get depleted

pounds a key to a 600 pound jacket so

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.580 
pounds a key to a 600 pound jacket so
we're<00:05:19.520> starting<00:05:20.030> small<00:05:20.180> so<00:05:20.960> we're<00:05:21.320> not<00:05:21.410> saying
