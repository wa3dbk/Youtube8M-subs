00:00:06.962 --> 00:00:08.550
Alright, let's get to work.

00:00:09.797 --> 00:00:11.970
- Hey, Roman, are you freaking out?
- No.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:13.513
Yes, you are.

00:00:13.721 --> 00:00:16.684
Shit, somebody just walk me through
what we're supposed to be doing!

00:00:21.281 --> 00:00:23.273
Just when you didn't think
it could get any better.

00:00:23.481 --> 00:00:24.649
Here we go.

00:00:37.078 --> 00:00:37.954
Hell yeah!

00:00:42.667 --> 00:00:43.793
Oh, shit!

00:00:48.047 --> 00:00:49.215
Hook 'em up!

00:00:57.932 --> 00:00:59.184
Brian, you're up!

00:01:07.108 --> 00:01:09.569
- I'm gonna get you out of here.
- You're gonna have to jump!

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:34.094
Dominic Toretto, you don't know me.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.390
You're about to.

00:01:38.832 --> 00:01:41.297
Looks like the sins of London
have followed us home.

00:01:41.547 --> 00:01:43.979
Remember Owen Shaw?
This is his big bad brother.

00:01:45.247 --> 00:01:46.398
We're being hunted.

00:01:49.532 --> 00:01:51.194
One last ride.

00:01:55.907 --> 00:01:56.867
Now we're talking.

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:06.334
Daddy's gotta go to work.

00:02:09.003 --> 00:02:11.048
This is a world
that doesn't play by your rules.

00:02:19.446 --> 00:02:22.434
Like it or not,
you and your friends are part of it now.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.227
I don't have friends.

00:02:24.435 --> 00:02:25.642
I got family.
