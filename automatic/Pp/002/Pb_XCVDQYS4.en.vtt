between<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.620> last<00:00:37.890> video<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.250> this<00:00:38.430> one<00:00:38.640> is

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
between the last video and this one is

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.049 
between the last video and this one is
most<00:00:39.690> obvious<00:00:40.200> is<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.410> paint<00:00:40.770> had<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.790> friend

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
most obvious is the paint had a friend

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.970 
most obvious is the paint had a friend
of<00:00:42.120> mine<00:00:42.270> do<00:00:42.450> some<00:00:42.629> graphics<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.320> some<00:00:43.649> custom

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
of mine do some graphics and some custom

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.490 
of mine do some graphics and some custom
paint<00:00:44.219> I<00:00:44.690> think<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:45.750> turned<00:00:45.930> out<00:00:46.050> really<00:00:46.260> nice

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
paint I think it turned out really nice

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.670 
paint I think it turned out really nice
a<00:00:47.450> little<00:00:48.450> hard<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.719> see<00:00:48.930> with<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.110> sunshine

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
a little hard to see with the sunshine

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.110 
a little hard to see with the sunshine
but<00:00:49.890> I'll<00:00:50.070> try<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.340> get<00:00:50.520> as<00:00:50.610> good<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.789> picture<00:00:51.059> as

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
but I'll try to get as good a picture as

00:00:51.120 --> 00:01:18.419 
but I'll try to get as good a picture as
I<00:00:51.239> can

00:01:18.419 --> 00:01:18.429 

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:20.099 

some<00:01:18.939> of<00:01:19.030> the<00:01:19.090> other<00:01:19.240> modifications<00:01:19.960> I've

00:01:20.099 --> 00:01:20.109 
some of the other modifications I've

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:23.010 
some of the other modifications I've
done<00:01:20.380> I<00:01:21.240> changed<00:01:22.240> out<00:01:22.390> the<00:01:22.420> rear<00:01:22.750> and<00:01:22.990> front

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
done I changed out the rear and front

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.749 
done I changed out the rear and front
sprockets<00:01:23.920> and<00:01:24.189> chain

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
sprockets and chain

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:27.090 
sprockets and chain
the<00:01:25.479> original<00:01:25.929> gearing<00:01:26.439> was<00:01:26.619> a<00:01:26.649> little<00:01:26.920> high

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
the original gearing was a little high

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.859 
the original gearing was a little high
was<00:01:27.460> revving<00:01:27.759> kind<00:01:27.969> of<00:01:28.060> high<00:01:28.179> at<00:01:28.329> lower<00:01:28.509> speeds

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
was revving kind of high at lower speeds

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.219 
was revving kind of high at lower speeds
so<00:01:29.740> I<00:01:29.770> changed<00:01:30.130> that<00:01:30.310> to<00:01:30.460> a<00:01:30.490> 17<00:01:31.060> front<00:01:31.420> 42<00:01:31.960> rear

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
so I changed that to a 17 front 42 rear

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:34.859 
so I changed that to a 17 front 42 rear
and<00:01:32.609> that<00:01:33.609> seems<00:01:33.909> to<00:01:34.090> have<00:01:34.210> solved<00:01:34.810> the

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
and that seems to have solved the

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:36.480 
and that seems to have solved the
problem<00:01:34.899> that<00:01:35.350> by<00:01:35.469> cruises<00:01:35.860> real<00:01:36.039> nice<00:01:36.250> now

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
problem that by cruises real nice now

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.240 
problem that by cruises real nice now
and<00:01:37.170> doesn't<00:01:38.170> Revis<00:01:38.439> eyes<00:01:38.590> it<00:01:38.799> used<00:01:38.979> to<00:01:39.100> before

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
and doesn't Revis eyes it used to before

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.630 
and doesn't Revis eyes it used to before
still<00:01:39.969> has<00:01:40.119> plenty<00:01:40.420> of<00:01:40.450> takeoff<00:01:40.869> power<00:01:41.619> so<00:01:42.039> no

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
still has plenty of takeoff power so no

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.609 
still has plenty of takeoff power so no
sacrifice<00:01:43.209> there<00:01:43.479> I<00:01:45.390> also<00:01:46.390> had<00:01:47.289> the<00:01:47.380> front

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
sacrifice there I also had the front

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.059 
sacrifice there I also had the front
forks<00:01:47.920> polished<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:49.509> while<00:01:50.500> I<00:01:50.530> was<00:01:50.739> added<00:01:50.979> I

00:01:51.059 --> 00:01:51.069 
forks polished and while I was added I

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:52.889 
forks polished and while I was added I
had<00:01:51.280> them<00:01:51.429> polished<00:01:51.640> the<00:01:51.970> rotor<00:01:52.479> and<00:01:52.750> the

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
had them polished the rotor and the

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:55.889 
had them polished the rotor and the
caliper<00:01:53.670> really<00:01:54.670> makes<00:01:54.849> for<00:01:54.939> a<00:01:55.090> nicer<00:01:55.450> cleaner

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 
caliper really makes for a nicer cleaner

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:00.730 
caliper really makes for a nicer cleaner
look

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:10.279 

added<00:02:01.370> some<00:02:01.400> end<00:02:01.760> caps<00:02:02.000> to<00:02:02.150> the<00:02:02.270> front<00:02:02.960> axles

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.709 

I<00:02:10.379> swept<00:02:11.219> out<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.400> throttle<00:02:11.939> cables<00:02:12.269> the

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:12.719 
I swept out the throttle cables the

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:15.940 
I swept out the throttle cables the
original<00:02:13.170> ones<00:02:13.349> were<00:02:13.790> six<00:02:14.790> over<00:02:15.209> motion<00:02:15.689> Pro

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
original ones were six over motion Pro

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.080 
original ones were six over motion Pro
they<00:02:16.950> tended<00:02:17.340> to<00:02:17.400> stick<00:02:17.670> out<00:02:17.819> from<00:02:18.000> the

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
they tended to stick out from the

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.729 
they tended to stick out from the
handlebars<00:02:18.569> a<00:02:18.900> little<00:02:19.200> bit<00:02:19.319> just<00:02:19.530> didn't

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
handlebars a little bit just didn't

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.399 
handlebars a little bit just didn't
quite<00:02:19.829> look<00:02:20.129> smooth<00:02:20.599> so<00:02:21.599> I<00:02:21.930> opted<00:02:22.230> to<00:02:22.290> change

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:22.409 
quite look smooth so I opted to change

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:25.250 
quite look smooth so I opted to change
them<00:02:22.709> out<00:02:22.829> I<00:02:22.859> went<00:02:23.340> with<00:02:23.519> two<00:02:23.790> over<00:02:24.120> and<00:02:24.260> they

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
them out I went with two over and they

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.199 
them out I went with two over and they
definitely<00:02:25.799> contour<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.609> bars<00:02:26.819> a<00:02:26.909> little<00:02:27.120> bit

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
definitely contour the bars a little bit

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.929 
definitely contour the bars a little bit
nicer<00:02:27.569> don't<00:02:28.379> stick<00:02:28.650> out<00:02:28.799> on<00:02:29.099> book<00:02:29.280> is<00:02:29.430> hideous

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:29.939 
nicer don't stick out on book is hideous

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:36.229 
nicer don't stick out on book is hideous
I<00:02:32.959> also<00:02:34.280> rebuilt<00:02:35.280> and<00:02:35.489> jetted<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:35.849> carburetor

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
I also rebuilt and jetted the carburetor

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:46.130 
I also rebuilt and jetted the carburetor
and<00:02:36.480> added<00:02:37.260> a<00:02:37.349> Kuryakin<00:02:37.980> hyper<00:02:38.220> charger

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.740 

and<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.860> pipes<00:02:47.100> are<00:02:47.430> as<00:02:47.730> I<00:02:48.330> mentioned<00:02:48.360> they

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
and the pipes are as I mentioned they

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:56.770 
and the pipes are as I mentioned they
