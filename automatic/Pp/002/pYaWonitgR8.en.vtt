pretty damn good game i even died in one

one<00:00:29.939> of<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.090> rounds<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.570> then<00:00:30.689> one<00:00:30.869> round<00:00:31.050> I

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
one of the rounds and then one round I

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.269 
one of the rounds and then one round I
just<00:00:31.260> didn't<00:00:31.439> have<00:00:31.470> time<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.859> defuse<00:00:32.189> it

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
just didn't have time to defuse it

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.620 
just didn't have time to defuse it
unfortunately<00:00:32.820> I<00:00:32.910> got<00:00:33.090> there<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.300> little<00:00:33.360> late

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
unfortunately I got there a little late

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.440 
unfortunately I got there a little late
and<00:00:33.960> I<00:00:34.320> didn't<00:00:35.160> judge<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.640> guy<00:00:35.790> correctly<00:00:36.420> I

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
and I didn't judge the guy correctly I

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.150 
and I didn't judge the guy correctly I
would<00:00:36.690> have<00:00:36.780> figured<00:00:36.960> he<00:00:37.350> would<00:00:37.530> have<00:00:37.620> stayed

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
would have figured he would have stayed

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.860 
would have figured he would have stayed
where<00:00:38.430> he<00:00:38.460> was<00:00:38.579> because<00:00:39.030> there<00:00:39.300> was<00:00:39.390> so<00:00:39.600> little

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
where he was because there was so little

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.229 
where he was because there was so little
time<00:00:40.260> left<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.680> he<00:00:40.800> ended<00:00:40.980> up<00:00:41.070> moving<00:00:41.280> so<00:00:42.059> when

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
time left and he ended up moving so when

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.330 
time left and he ended up moving so when
I<00:00:42.270> was<00:00:42.840> looking<00:00:43.170> that<00:00:43.290> way<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.680> I<00:00:43.800> did<00:00:44.219> the

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
I was looking that way and I did the

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.000 
I was looking that way and I did the
fake<00:00:44.460> diffuse<00:00:44.820> he<00:00:45.090> wasn't<00:00:45.840> there<00:00:46.050> ended<00:00:46.920> up

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
fake diffuse he wasn't there ended up

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.650 
fake diffuse he wasn't there ended up
having<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.340> take<00:00:47.430> an<00:00:47.640> extra<00:00:47.910> second<00:00:48.239> half<00:00:48.480> to

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
having to take an extra second half to

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.810 
having to take an extra second half to
kill<00:00:48.809> him<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.230> then<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:49.559> lost<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.399> round<00:00:50.579> for

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
kill him and then I lost the round for

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.020 
kill him and then I lost the round for
that<00:00:51.829> obviously<00:00:52.850> interpretation<00:00:53.850> and

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
that obviously interpretation and

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.209 
that obviously interpretation and
prediction<00:00:54.539> just<00:00:54.870> does<00:00:55.110> not<00:00:55.289> always<00:00:55.620> work<00:00:55.860> in

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
prediction just does not always work in

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.200 
prediction just does not always work in

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
but prediction is part of it and you

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.090 
but prediction is part of it and you
have<00:03:24.360> to<00:03:24.540> learn<00:03:24.630> to<00:03:24.690> predict<00:03:25.140> people<00:03:25.470> you<00:03:25.920> can

have to learn to predict people you can

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.500 
have to learn to predict people you can
get<00:03:26.220> this<00:03:26.400> from<00:03:26.520> experience<00:03:26.700> you<00:03:27.180> can<00:03:27.390> get

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
get this from experience you can get

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:28.940 
get this from experience you can get
this<00:03:27.690> from<00:03:27.870> thinking<00:03:28.320> about<00:03:28.410> what<00:03:28.680> you<00:03:28.710> would

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
this from thinking about what you would

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.320 
this from thinking about what you would
do<00:03:29.130> as<00:03:29.250> a<00:03:29.280> good<00:03:29.490> play<00:03:29.730> or<00:03:29.880> what<00:03:29.970> you<00:03:30.060> would<00:03:30.180> do

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
do as a good play or what you would do

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:31.970 
do as a good play or what you would do
is<00:03:30.480> maybe<00:03:30.630> a<00:03:30.720> not<00:03:30.900> so<00:03:31.080> experienced<00:03:31.530> player<00:03:31.740> it

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
is maybe a not so experienced player it

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.710 
is maybe a not so experienced player it
changes<00:03:32.730> throughout<00:03:33.030> the<00:03:33.240> game<00:03:33.390> there's<00:03:33.660> a

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
changes throughout the game there's a

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.320 
changes throughout the game there's a
lot<00:03:33.960> to<00:03:34.200> think<00:03:34.230> about<00:03:34.530> but<00:03:34.920> when<00:03:35.610> you<00:03:35.730> do<00:03:35.910> it<00:03:36.030> so

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
lot to think about but when you do it so

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.660 
lot to think about but when you do it so
much<00:03:36.570> it<00:03:37.080> becomes<00:03:37.440> second<00:03:37.860> nature<00:03:37.890> so<00:03:38.550> in

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
much it becomes second nature so in

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.190 
much it becomes second nature so in
Search<00:03:38.880> and<00:03:39.000> Destroy<00:03:39.030> when<00:03:39.540> I<00:03:39.570> go<00:03:39.900> through

and asteroid player and I explain things

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.260 
and asteroid player and I explain things
like<00:03:43.530> oh<00:03:43.620> I<00:03:43.650> hear<00:03:43.980> metal<00:03:44.310> I<00:03:44.460> know<00:03:44.610> metal<00:03:45.180> is

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
like oh I hear metal I know metal is

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:46.910 
like oh I hear metal I know metal is
only<00:03:45.390> in<00:03:45.540> these<00:03:45.660> certain<00:03:46.200> spots<00:03:46.440> I<00:03:46.620> heard<00:03:46.800> in

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
only in these certain spots I heard in

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.880 
only in these certain spots I heard in
this<00:03:47.010> it<00:03:47.220> like<00:03:47.940> area<00:03:48.330> our<00:03:48.510> location<00:03:49.050> I'm<00:03:49.470> know

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
this it like area our location I'm know

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.710 
this it like area our location I'm know
where<00:03:50.070> he's<00:03:50.190> going<00:03:50.310> to<00:03:50.430> be<00:03:50.580> at<00:03:50.760> that<00:03:51.450> might

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
where he's going to be at that might

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.410 
where he's going to be at that might
seem<00:03:52.110> complicated<00:03:52.530> it<00:03:52.980> really<00:03:53.400> isn't<00:03:53.730> once

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
seem complicated it really isn't once

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.780 
seem complicated it really isn't once
you<00:03:54.570> have<00:03:54.600> a<00:03:54.810> lot<00:03:55.170> of<00:03:55.200> practice<00:03:55.890> it<00:03:56.460> just

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
you have a lot of practice it just

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.730 
you have a lot of practice it just
happens<00:03:57.510> if<00:03:57.750> it's<00:03:57.870> not<00:03:58.050> even<00:03:58.320> something<00:03:58.590> that

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:58.740 
happens if it's not even something that

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.830 
happens if it's not even something that
you<00:03:58.980> can<00:03:59.160> explain<00:03:59.550> really<00:03:59.790> it's<00:03:59.880> hard<00:04:00.120> but

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
you can explain really it's hard but

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.570 
you can explain really it's hard but
literally<00:04:01.290> if<00:04:01.650> you<00:04:01.860> understand<00:04:02.340> the<00:04:02.400> brain

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
literally if you understand the brain

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.190 
literally if you understand the brain
and<00:04:02.760> how<00:04:02.850> mental<00:04:03.180> processes<00:04:03.690> work<00:04:03.900> which<00:04:04.080> I

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
and how mental processes work which I

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.810 
and how mental processes work which I
don't<00:04:04.470> really<00:04:04.830> that<00:04:04.950> well<00:04:05.130> I'm<00:04:05.310> not<00:04:05.460> going<00:04:05.730> to

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
don't really that well I'm not going to

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.370 
don't really that well I'm not going to
say<00:04:05.910> I<00:04:05.970> do<00:04:06.060> I<00:04:06.450> just<00:04:06.780> know<00:04:07.080> that<00:04:07.230> their

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
say I do I just know that their

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.690 
say I do I just know that their
electrical<00:04:07.740> signals<00:04:08.100> within<00:04:08.370> your<00:04:08.520> brain

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
electrical signals within your brain

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.420 
electrical signals within your brain
that<00:04:09.030> are<00:04:09.270> sent<00:04:10.080> out<00:04:10.230> and<00:04:10.530> it<00:04:10.830> tells<00:04:11.040> you<00:04:11.190> to<00:04:11.310> do

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
that are sent out and it tells you to do

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.280 
that are sent out and it tells you to do
by<00:04:11.610> you<00:04:11.670> to<00:04:11.820> do<00:04:11.940> something<00:04:12.180> when<00:04:12.930> it<00:04:13.020> comes<00:04:13.170> to

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
by you to do something when it comes to

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.480 
by you to do something when it comes to
search<00:04:13.500> and<00:04:13.620> destroy<00:04:13.740> and<00:04:14.010> understanding

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490 
search and destroy and understanding

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.729 
search and destroy and understanding
people<00:04:14.820> those<00:04:15.090> signals<00:04:15.480> are<00:04:15.660> just<00:04:15.870> like<00:04:16.049> that

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
people those signals are just like that

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.860 
people those signals are just like that
I<00:04:16.980> mean<00:04:17.400> it<00:04:17.580> is<00:04:17.730> that<00:04:17.970> quick<00:04:18.299> I<00:04:18.420> can<00:04:18.570> just<00:04:18.720> think

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
I mean it is that quick I can just think

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.030 
I mean it is that quick I can just think
about<00:04:18.989> it<00:04:19.200> for<00:04:19.230> a<00:04:19.350> second<00:04:19.680> and<00:04:19.739> I<00:04:19.859> instantly

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
about it for a second and I instantly

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.460 
about it for a second and I instantly
know<00:04:20.400> what<00:04:20.549> to<00:04:20.640> do<00:04:20.760> it's<00:04:21.480> not<00:04:21.720> it's<00:04:22.290> not

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
know what to do it's not it's not

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.950 
know what to do it's not it's not
something<00:04:22.890> that<00:04:22.919> oh<00:04:23.370> I<00:04:24.090> don't<00:04:24.630> know<00:04:24.750> if<00:04:24.840> you

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
something that oh I don't know if you

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.360 
something that oh I don't know if you
can<00:04:25.110> learn<00:04:25.290> it<00:04:25.470> I<00:04:25.560> don't<00:04:25.800> really<00:04:25.979> know<00:04:26.190> to<00:04:26.250> be

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
can learn it I don't really know to be

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.100 
can learn it I don't really know to be
honest<00:04:26.700> it's<00:04:26.910> just<00:04:27.090> because<00:04:27.330> I've<00:04:27.450> played<00:04:27.720> for

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
honest it's just because I've played for

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.559 
honest it's just because I've played for
so<00:04:28.290> much

00:04:28.559 --> 00:04:28.569 
so much

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:30.869 
so much
that<00:04:28.659> I<00:04:28.689> believe<00:04:28.990> that<00:04:29.020> I<00:04:29.139> am<00:04:29.469> able<00:04:30.279> to<00:04:30.699> make

00:04:30.869 --> 00:04:30.879 
that I believe that I am able to make

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:33.480 
that I believe that I am able to make
the<00:04:31.029> split<00:04:31.389> split<00:04:31.809> split<00:04:32.069> second<00:04:33.069> decisions

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
the split split split second decisions

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.089 
the split split split second decisions
quicker<00:04:34.270> than<00:04:34.479> most<00:04:34.539> which<00:04:35.499> makes<00:04:35.740> it<00:04:35.919> really

00:04:36.089 --> 00:04:36.099 
quicker than most which makes it really

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:38.609 
quicker than most which makes it really
good<00:04:36.580> for<00:04:36.639> a<00:04:37.059> call<00:04:37.809> of<00:04:37.929> duty<00:04:38.139> game<00:04:38.289> because

00:04:38.609 --> 00:04:38.619 
good for a call of duty game because

00:04:38.619 --> 00:04:40.169 
good for a call of duty game because
call<00:04:38.830> duty<00:04:39.039> is<00:04:39.189> all<00:04:39.339> about<00:04:39.610> reaction<00:04:39.819> time

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:40.179 
call duty is all about reaction time

00:04:40.179 --> 00:04:42.719 
call duty is all about reaction time
halo<00:04:41.139> it's<00:04:41.679> similar<00:04:42.009> but<00:04:42.159> it's<00:04:42.429> not<00:04:42.550> all<00:04:42.699> about

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:42.729 
halo it's similar but it's not all about

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:44.760 
halo it's similar but it's not all about
reaction<00:04:43.089> time<00:04:43.360> accuracy<00:04:44.110> plays<00:04:44.319> in<00:04:44.499> a<00:04:44.589> lot

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
reaction time accuracy plays in a lot

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:45.959 
reaction time accuracy plays in a lot
and<00:04:44.949> call<00:04:45.159> of<00:04:45.249> duty<00:04:45.429> if<00:04:45.490> you<00:04:45.580> get<00:04:45.699> the<00:04:45.789> first

00:04:45.959 --> 00:04:45.969 
and call of duty if you get the first

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:47.189 
and call of duty if you get the first
shot<00:04:46.059> off<00:04:46.330> there's<00:04:46.569> a<00:04:46.629> great<00:04:46.809> chance<00:04:47.020> that

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:47.199 
shot off there's a great chance that

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:49.769 
shot off there's a great chance that
you're<00:04:47.319> going<00:04:47.409> to<00:04:47.499> win<00:04:47.649> that<00:04:47.770> gunfight<00:04:48.779> but

00:04:49.769 --> 00:04:49.779 
you're going to win that gunfight but

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:51.929 
you're going to win that gunfight but
that<00:04:49.929> pretty<00:04:50.139> much<00:04:50.289> wraps<00:04:51.189> up<00:04:51.399> prediction

00:04:51.929 --> 00:04:51.939 
that pretty much wraps up prediction

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:53.249 
that pretty much wraps up prediction
there's<00:04:52.119> a<00:04:52.179> lot<00:04:52.330> of<00:04:52.360> things<00:04:52.599> like<00:04:52.749> I<00:04:52.839> said<00:04:53.080> but

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:53.259 
there's a lot of things like I said but

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:54.449 
there's a lot of things like I said but
I<00:04:53.319> wanted<00:04:53.499> to<00:04:53.559> talk<00:04:53.740> about<00:04:53.860> a<00:04:53.949> few<00:04:54.189> in<00:04:54.339> this

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:54.459 
I wanted to talk about a few in this

00:04:54.459 --> 00:04:55.939 
I wanted to talk about a few in this
game<00:04:54.639> and<00:04:54.849> what<00:04:55.119> makes<00:04:55.300> a<00:04:55.389> good<00:04:55.509> player

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:55.949 
game and what makes a good player

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:57.989 
game and what makes a good player
obviously<00:04:56.949> decision<00:04:57.429> making<00:04:57.699> a<00:04:57.819> prediction

00:04:57.989 --> 00:04:57.999 
obviously decision making a prediction

00:04:57.999 --> 00:05:00.480 
obviously decision making a prediction
is<00:04:58.360> big<00:04:58.659> but<00:04:59.439> I<00:04:59.499> think<00:04:59.740> another<00:04:59.919> good<00:05:00.249> thing<00:05:00.279> is

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
is big but I think another good thing is

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.459 
is big but I think another good thing is
teamwork<00:05:00.939> as<00:05:01.300> you<00:05:01.569> can<00:05:01.659> see<00:05:01.899> in<00:05:01.990> this<00:05:02.080> game<00:05:02.289> I'm

00:05:02.459 --> 00:05:02.469 
teamwork as you can see in this game I'm

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:05.100 
teamwork as you can see in this game I'm
pretty<00:05:02.830> much<00:05:02.919> a<00:05:03.309> one-man<00:05:03.550> team<00:05:04.089> but<00:05:04.719> if<00:05:04.809> you<00:05:04.930> go

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
pretty much a one-man team but if you go

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.019 
pretty much a one-man team but if you go
back<00:05:05.259> and<00:05:05.319> you'll<00:05:05.619> watch<00:05:05.860> like<00:05:06.189> videos<00:05:06.789> if<00:05:06.939> we

00:05:07.019 --> 00:05:07.029 
back and you'll watch like videos if we

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:08.369 
back and you'll watch like videos if we
ever<00:05:07.119> upload<00:05:07.419> a<00:05:07.449> video<00:05:07.629> with<00:05:07.839> all<00:05:08.020> the<00:05:08.199> Search

00:05:08.369 --> 00:05:08.379 
ever upload a video with all the Search

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:10.409 
ever upload a video with all the Search
and<00:05:08.499> Destroy<00:05:08.529> elite<00:05:08.949> in<00:05:09.039> it<00:05:09.159> we<00:05:09.879> may<00:05:10.089> be<00:05:10.149> only

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:10.419 
and Destroy elite in it we may be only

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:12.149 
and Destroy elite in it we may be only
get<00:05:10.719> three<00:05:11.020> to<00:05:11.110> four<00:05:11.259> kills<00:05:11.529> each<00:05:11.740> person

00:05:12.149 --> 00:05:12.159 
get three to four kills each person

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:14.279 
get three to four kills each person
because<00:05:12.459> we<00:05:12.639> all<00:05:12.849> know<00:05:12.879> what<00:05:13.389> we're<00:05:13.539> doing<00:05:13.719> we

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:14.289 
because we all know what we're doing we

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:16.439 
because we all know what we're doing we
give<00:05:14.559> call<00:05:14.889> outs<00:05:15.129> and<00:05:15.459> we<00:05:15.669> tell<00:05:15.909> people<00:05:16.240> what's

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:16.449 
give call outs and we tell people what's

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:18.179 
give call outs and we tell people what's
going<00:05:16.719> on<00:05:16.869> plus<00:05:17.199> we<00:05:17.379> all<00:05:17.499> run<00:05:17.709> our<00:05:17.830> own<00:05:17.860> routes

00:05:18.179 --> 00:05:18.189 
going on plus we all run our own routes

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:21.299 
going on plus we all run our own routes
and<00:05:18.430> we<00:05:18.490> expect<00:05:18.959> what<00:05:19.959> I<00:05:19.990> got<00:05:20.439> we<00:05:20.800> expect<00:05:21.159> each

00:05:21.299 --> 00:05:21.309 
and we expect what I got we expect each

00:05:21.309 --> 00:05:24.029 
and we expect what I got we expect each
other<00:05:21.399> to<00:05:21.519> do<00:05:21.789> the<00:05:22.119> right<00:05:22.300> things<00:05:22.949> anywhere<00:05:23.949> in

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:24.039 
other to do the right things anywhere in

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:26.639 
other to do the right things anywhere in
this<00:05:24.490> game<00:05:24.699> I<00:05:24.969> basically<00:05:25.689> went<00:05:26.139> in<00:05:26.349> and

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:26.649 
this game I basically went in and

00:05:26.649 --> 00:05:28.499 
this game I basically went in and
expected<00:05:27.159> my<00:05:27.309> team<00:05:27.550> to<00:05:27.789> camp<00:05:27.969> in<00:05:28.089> the<00:05:28.179> back<00:05:28.330> of

00:05:28.499 --> 00:05:28.509 
expected my team to camp in the back of

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:30.299 
expected my team to camp in the back of
my<00:05:28.539> spawn<00:05:28.869> like<00:05:29.110> I<00:05:29.259> always<00:05:29.559> see<00:05:29.769> and<00:05:30.009> I'm<00:05:30.129> gonna

00:05:30.299 --> 00:05:30.309 
my spawn like I always see and I'm gonna

00:05:30.309 --> 00:05:31.980 
my spawn like I always see and I'm gonna
run<00:05:30.519> up<00:05:30.639> and<00:05:30.759> basically<00:05:31.149> solo<00:05:31.539> the<00:05:31.719> entire

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 
run up and basically solo the entire

in the back of the spot i'm alway coming
from<00:05:39.069> their<00:05:39.279> side<00:05:39.519> and<00:05:39.819> i<00:05:40.689> literally<00:05:41.289> just<00:05:41.409> had

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:41.649 
from their side and i literally just had

00:05:41.649 --> 00:05:43.199 
from their side and i literally just had
no<00:05:41.830> faith<00:05:42.129> in<00:05:42.159> them<00:05:42.459> so<00:05:42.639> I<00:05:42.669> was<00:05:42.879> like<00:05:42.999> all<00:05:43.149> right

no faith in them so I was like all right
well<00:05:43.330> I<00:05:43.539> gotta<00:05:43.719> make<00:05:43.839> sure<00:05:43.899> I<00:05:44.050> do<00:05:44.139> this<00:05:44.319> right

00:05:44.579 --> 00:05:44.589

about<00:05:55.119> prediction<00:05:55.569> we<00:05:55.629> go<00:05:55.719> by<00:05:55.809> tradition<00:05:56.169> for

00:05:56.309 --> 00:05:56.319 
about prediction we go by tradition for

00:05:56.319 --> 00:05:58.170 
about prediction we go by tradition for
one<00:05:56.409> second<00:05:56.769> right<00:05:56.860> there<00:05:57.039> you<00:05:57.430> saw<00:05:57.669> how<00:05:57.819> I<00:05:57.849> cut

one second right there you saw how I cut
behind<00:05:58.329> the<00:05:58.599> bus<00:05:58.749> and<00:05:58.990> i<00:05:59.079> did<00:05:59.229> a<00:05:59.289> jump<00:05:59.529> shot

00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680 
behind the bus and i did a jump shot

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.649 
behind the bus and i did a jump shot
back<00:05:59.919> out<00:06:00.159> a<00:06:00.399> lot<00:06:00.849> of<00:06:00.969> people<00:06:01.209> refer<00:06:01.479> to<00:06:01.509> that

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:12.399 
challenging although it seems like a

00:06:12.399 --> 00:06:15.089 
challenging although it seems like a
stupid<00:06:12.639> move<00:06:12.909> sometimes<00:06:13.389> it's<00:06:14.110> actually<00:06:14.769> one

00:06:15.089 --> 00:06:15.099 
stupid move sometimes it's actually one

of<00:06:15.129> those<00:06:15.309> things<00:06:15.519> where<00:06:15.699> you<00:06:15.909> can<00:06:16.059> predict

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:16.449 
of those things where you can predict

00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:26.259 
those things that you can predict

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:28.799

ended up going behind to begin with it's

00:06:38.499 --> 00:06:40.409 
ended up going behind to begin with it's
all<00:06:38.769> about<00:06:38.800> counters<00:06:39.579> and<00:06:39.759> prediction<00:06:40.240> and

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:40.419 
all about counters and prediction and

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:42.239 
all about counters and prediction and
you<00:06:40.930> have<00:06:41.110> to<00:06:41.229> be<00:06:41.289> able<00:06:41.409> to<00:06:41.529> predict<00:06:41.800> people

00:06:42.239 --> 00:06:42.249 
you have to be able to predict people

00:06:42.249 --> 00:06:44.099

they're good or bad because your

00:06:44.109 --> 00:06:45.329 
they're good or bad because your
predictions<00:06:44.469> will<00:06:44.619> change<00:06:44.859> based<00:06:45.069> on<00:06:45.249> the

00:06:45.329 --> 00:06:45.339 
predictions will change based on the

00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:48.539

person's<00:06:45.549> skill<00:06:45.939> level<00:06:47.159> but<00:06:48.159> I<00:06:48.309> said

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:48.549 
person's skill level but I said

00:06:48.549 --> 00:06:50.729 
person's skill level but I said
prediction<00:06:49.359> is<00:06:49.449> important<00:06:49.839> I<00:06:49.929> think<00:06:50.019> teamwork

00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:50.739 
prediction is important I think teamwork

00:06:50.739 --> 00:06:53.849 
prediction is important I think teamwork
is<00:06:50.979> important<00:06:51.489> i<00:06:52.209> think<00:06:52.539> that<00:06:53.139> map<00:06:53.439> awareness

00:06:53.849 --> 00:06:53.859 
is important i think that map awareness

00:06:53.859 --> 00:06:55.829 
is important i think that map awareness
and<00:06:54.339> awareness<00:06:54.459> in<00:06:54.909> general<00:06:55.209> is<00:06:55.329> extremely

and awareness in general is extremely

00:06:55.839 --> 00:06:57.659 
and awareness in general is extremely
