we're showing that we can also bind to
the<00:01:09.299> mating<00:01:09.659> piece<00:01:09.929> so<00:01:10.289> we<00:01:10.439> could<00:01:10.590> take<00:01:10.770> metal

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.050 
the mating piece so we could take metal

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.720 
the mating piece so we could take metal
or<00:01:13.620> plastics<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:15.500> bond<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.800> matings<00:01:17.190> rubber

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:17.730 
or plastics and bond the matings rubber

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.810 
or plastics and bond the matings rubber
piece<00:01:18.060> right<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.870> this<00:01:19.680> is<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.130> metal<00:01:20.670> to

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
piece right to it this is the metal to

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.420 
piece right to it this is the metal to
rubber<00:01:21.090> bonded<00:01:21.570> part<00:01:21.870> and<00:01:22.230> the<00:01:22.740> advantages<00:01:23.370> of

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
rubber bonded part and the advantages of

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.580 
rubber bonded part and the advantages of
this<00:01:23.700> is<00:01:23.760> that<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.630> would<00:01:24.840> put<00:01:25.020> this<00:01:25.230> part

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
this is that you would put this part

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.160 
this is that you would put this part
right<00:01:25.860> in<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.130> press<00:01:26.400> Banda<00:01:27.300> Ceylon<00:01:27.810> you

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
right in the press Banda Ceylon you

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.070 
right in the press Banda Ceylon you
would<00:01:28.320> eliminate<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.980> stack<00:01:29.250> of<00:01:29.430> times<00:01:30.080> you

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
would eliminate the stack of times you

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.960 
would eliminate the stack of times you
would<00:01:31.290> have<00:01:31.500> one<00:01:31.770> piece<00:01:32.010> instead<00:01:32.400> of<00:01:32.520> three<00:01:32.760> to

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
would have one piece instead of three to

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.050 
would have one piece instead of three to
assemble<00:01:33.560> and<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:35.160> would<00:01:35.250> be<00:01:35.400> much<00:01:35.580> easier<00:01:35.610> to

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
assemble and it would be much easier to

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.480 
assemble and it would be much easier to
assemble<00:01:36.630> than<00:01:36.960> some<00:01:37.260> flimsy<00:01:37.590> part<00:01:38.040> like<00:01:38.280> this

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
assemble than some flimsy part like this

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.490 
assemble than some flimsy part like this
to<00:01:38.760> put<00:01:38.970> into<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.390> groove<00:01:39.630> what's<00:01:40.260> great

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
to put into the groove what's great

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.100 
to put into the groove what's great
about<00:01:40.530> this<00:01:40.950> is<00:01:41.220> it<00:01:41.550> may<00:01:42.090> cost<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.570> little<00:01:42.720> more

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
about this is it may cost a little more

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.170 
about this is it may cost a little more
for<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.470> piece<00:01:43.770> price<00:01:44.100> but<00:01:44.430> it<00:01:44.550> doesn't<00:01:44.970> cost

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
for the piece price but it doesn't cost

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.300 
for the piece price but it doesn't cost
as<00:01:45.450> much<00:01:45.480> to<00:01:45.900> assemble<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.530> so<00:01:46.650> you're<00:01:46.890> saving

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
as much to assemble it so you're saving

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.190 
as much to assemble it so you're saving
money<00:01:47.460> there<00:01:47.820> we<00:01:48.240> do<00:01:48.540> all<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:49.020> rubber

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200

calf<00:02:12.060> of<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.300> pen<00:02:13.070> what<00:02:14.070> is<00:02:14.190> great<00:02:14.400> about

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
calf of the pen what is great about

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.479 
calf of the pen what is great about
Apple<00:02:15.000> is<00:02:15.180> they<00:02:15.390> came<00:02:15.990> to<00:02:16.200> us<00:02:16.350> with<00:02:16.710> an<00:02:16.980> idea

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
Apple is they came to us with an idea

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.000 
Apple is they came to us with an idea
and<00:02:18.000> it<00:02:18.480> wasn't<00:02:18.840> working<00:02:19.020> properly<00:02:19.200> for<00:02:19.920> him

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
and it wasn't working properly for him

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.650 
and it wasn't working properly for him
so<00:02:20.160> we<00:02:20.250> said<00:02:20.430> instead<00:02:20.700> of<00:02:20.790> a<00:02:20.850> square<00:02:21.150> part

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
so we said instead of a square part

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.570 
so we said instead of a square part
let's<00:02:22.050> put<00:02:22.260> a<00:02:22.290> round<00:02:22.560> part<00:02:22.860> in<00:02:23.010> there<00:02:23.190> so<00:02:23.400> it'll

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
let's put a round part in there so it'll

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.880 
let's put a round part in there so it'll
seal<00:02:23.940> properly<00:02:24.660> and<00:02:24.900> it<00:02:25.380> solved<00:02:25.739> their

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
seal properly and it solved their

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.460 
seal properly and it solved their
problem<00:02:26.390> Express<00:02:27.390> cos<00:02:27.810> division<00:02:28.320> of<00:02:28.410> the
