00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.670
 Welcome to another video today. 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.660
 will be fire will be different will not 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.219
 be focused on the match itself is more 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.710
 to talk with you up to a 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.549
 little things to clarify and tell 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.340
 you 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.289
 first I started playing a lot and I 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.539
 follow the loose playing said war 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.539
 a lot of people with cover and end up having 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.210
 to kill guys so I I'm not 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.859
 but leaving to attack who has the cover 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.289
 if you no longer want to use the cover you can 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.880
 stay at home to take year does 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.590
 difference if you want to continue 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.540
 using it because it's cool or why you 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.579
 like you can continue to use is on 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.860
 but if you want to use other 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.930
 layers is also quiet from 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.879
 now the cover will only be aesthetics 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:50.670
 will no longer have an importance with 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.129
 you are of real importance only to 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.750
 beautiful, let's just say the way the door 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.030
 but that's what we say 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.230
 and another thing I recorded a video with a 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.180
 lots of people 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.760

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.820

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.860
 together but let's see what they look like 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.500

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.540

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.350

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.350
 phelps between there and a lay the favorite 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.780
 comment because he has a small car 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.159
 Even more, he thinks he's too expensive. 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.619
 a lot of fine people a lot of the time 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.390

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.700
 process has already entered his yard and there 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.790

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:48.149
