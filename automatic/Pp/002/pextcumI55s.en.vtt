00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:24.019 
in some creepers or in creepers in

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:26.800 
in some creepers or in creepers in
general<00:00:24.589> and<00:00:25.009> I<00:00:25.400> did<00:00:25.580> like<00:00:25.759> a<00:00:25.939> lot<00:00:26.300> of<00:00:26.359> research

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
general and I did like a lot of research

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.069 
general and I did like a lot of research
to<00:00:26.839> try<00:00:27.019> and<00:00:27.320> figure<00:00:27.470> out<00:00:28.329> what<00:00:29.329> was<00:00:29.539> going<00:00:29.570> on

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:30.079 
to try and figure out what was going on

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:32.499 
to try and figure out what was going on
the<00:00:30.230> secret<00:00:30.560> compartment<00:00:30.710> and<00:00:31.609> basically<00:00:32.060> I

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:32.509 
the secret compartment and basically I

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.060 
the secret compartment and basically I
figured<00:00:33.469> out<00:00:33.590> that<00:00:34.390> vegan<00:00:35.390> creepers<00:00:35.930> will<00:00:36.890> be

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
figured out that vegan creepers will be

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.270 
figured out that vegan creepers will be
creepers<00:00:37.550> they're<00:00:37.820> kind<00:00:38.000> of<00:00:38.059> known<00:00:38.239> as<00:00:38.270> um

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
creepers they're kind of known as um

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.279 
creepers they're kind of known as um
which<00:00:40.280> I<00:00:40.399> like<00:00:40.579> all<00:00:40.850> animal<00:00:41.359> free<00:00:41.660> version<00:00:42.170> of

00:00:42.279 --> 00:00:42.289 
which I like all animal free version of

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:43.630 
which I like all animal free version of
creepers<00:00:42.680> there<00:00:42.829> is<00:00:42.920> that<00:00:43.100> they<00:00:43.250> look<00:00:43.489> exactly

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
creepers there is that they look exactly

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.599 
creepers there is that they look exactly
the<00:00:44.059> same<00:00:44.149> you<00:00:44.420> can't<00:00:44.600> tell<00:00:44.840> the<00:00:45.019> difference

00:00:45.599 --> 00:00:45.609 
the same you can't tell the difference

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:48.459 
the same you can't tell the difference
have<00:00:46.609> the<00:00:46.850> secret<00:00:47.000> compartment<00:00:47.469> underneath

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469 
have the secret compartment underneath

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:51.610 
have the secret compartment underneath
the<00:00:48.769> soul<00:00:48.980> and<00:00:49.690> I<00:00:50.690> think<00:00:51.140> there's<00:00:51.350> a<00:00:51.410> version

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
the soul and I think there's a version

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.529 
the soul and I think there's a version
of<00:00:51.829> creepers<00:00:52.280> which<00:00:53.000> are<00:00:53.179> the<00:00:53.269> normal

00:00:53.529 --> 00:00:53.539 
of creepers which are the normal

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:56.189 
of creepers which are the normal
creepers<00:00:53.960> but<00:00:54.440> they<00:00:54.559> have<00:00:54.800> leather<00:00:55.579> on<00:00:56.000> the

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:56.199 
creepers but they have leather on the

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:00.369 
creepers but they have leather on the
not<00:00:57.199> leather<00:00:57.670> leopard<00:00:58.670> print<00:00:58.879> on<00:00:59.059> the<00:00:59.839> top<00:01:00.079> I

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
not leather leopard print on the top I

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:02.349 
not leather leopard print on the top I
think<00:01:01.250> they<00:01:01.489> may<00:01:01.670> have<00:01:01.699> a<00:01:01.879> secret<00:01:02.210> compartment

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359 
think they may have a secret compartment

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:03.669 
think they may have a secret compartment
but<00:01:02.870> i'm<00:01:02.960> not<00:01:02.989> sure<00:01:03.109> about<00:01:03.289> that<00:01:03.469> but

00:01:03.669 --> 00:01:03.679 
but i'm not sure about that but

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:06.340 
but i'm not sure about that but
