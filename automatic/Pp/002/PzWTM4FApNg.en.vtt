00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:18.890 
there's a couple of types of things that
I'd<00:02:17.580> like<00:02:17.610> to<00:02:17.820> point<00:02:18.120> out<00:02:18.270> just<00:02:18.330> from<00:02:18.660> this

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
I'd like to point out just from this

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.610 
I'd like to point out just from this
screen<00:02:19.110> alone<00:02:19.470> and<00:02:19.680> first<00:02:20.220> of<00:02:20.430> all<00:02:20.580> is<00:02:21.620> where

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
screen alone and first of all is where

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.300 
screen alone and first of all is where
it<00:02:22.709> says<00:02:22.890> PDF<00:02:23.160> full<00:02:23.580> text<00:02:24.709> this<00:02:25.709> means<00:02:26.040> that

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
it says PDF full text this means that

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.699 
it says PDF full text this means that
you're<00:02:26.459> able<00:02:26.820> to<00:02:27.209> download<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.930> entire<00:02:28.080> text

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
you're able to download the entire text

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.280 
you're able to download the entire text
of<00:02:28.980> the<00:02:29.340> article<00:02:29.760> and<00:02:29.880> if<00:02:30.720> you<00:02:30.840> want<00:02:31.050> you<00:02:31.170> could

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
of the article and if you want you could

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.320 
of the article and if you want you could
print<00:02:31.500> it<00:02:31.590> out<00:02:31.740> highlight<00:02:32.520> it<00:02:32.700> make<00:02:32.910> notes<00:02:33.150> on

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
print it out highlight it make notes on

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.780 
print it out highlight it make notes on
it<00:02:33.390> whatever<00:02:33.780> it<00:02:34.020> is<00:02:34.200> if<00:02:34.470> it<00:02:35.070> doesn't<00:02:35.580> have

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
it whatever it is if it doesn't have

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.520 
it whatever it is if it doesn't have
that<00:02:35.820> then<00:02:36.360> there's<00:02:36.570> an<00:02:36.720> additional<00:02:37.110> step

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
that then there's an additional step

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.230 
that then there's an additional step
that<00:02:37.709> you'll<00:02:38.070> need<00:02:38.280> to<00:02:38.400> complete<00:02:38.550> to<00:02:38.970> try<00:02:39.180> to

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
that you'll need to complete to try to

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.699 
that you'll need to complete to try to
find<00:02:39.570> the<00:02:39.750> actual<00:02:39.930> article<00:02:41.630> but<00:02:42.630> as<00:02:42.959> I<00:02:43.530> look

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
find the actual article but as I look

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.350 
find the actual article but as I look
here<00:02:43.950> I<00:02:43.980> see<00:02:44.280> lots<00:02:44.459> of<00:02:44.670> articles<00:02:44.970> that<00:02:45.330> are

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
here I see lots of articles that are

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.699 
here I see lots of articles that are
going<00:02:45.600> to<00:02:45.720> be<00:02:46.230> relative<00:02:47.130> I<00:02:47.400> hope<00:02:48.440> but<00:02:49.440> I<00:02:49.470> see

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
going to be relative I hope but I see

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.750 
going to be relative I hope but I see
things<00:02:50.130> such<00:02:50.400> like<00:02:50.640> education<00:02:51.330> week<00:02:51.570> or<00:02:52.760> times

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
things such like education week or times

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.150 
things such like education week or times
higher<00:02:54.090> education<00:02:54.840> those<00:02:55.560> are<00:02:55.739> kind<00:02:55.950> of<00:02:56.010> like

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
higher education those are kind of like

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
higher education those are kind of like
um<00:02:56.430> newspapers<00:02:58.580> you<00:02:59.580> know<00:02:59.730> where<00:03:00.000> they're

what<00:03:24.840> it<00:03:24.930> should<00:03:25.110> do<00:03:25.230> is<00:03:25.350> it<00:03:25.470> should<00:03:25.590> take<00:03:25.769> my

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
what it should do is it should take my

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.340

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.009 
and it should redefine what I'm looking
for<00:03:33.690> and<00:03:34.230> as<00:03:35.190> you<00:03:35.370> notice<00:03:35.549> I<00:03:35.850> had<00:03:36.030> 102<00:03:36.570> articles

again may or may not be relative to what

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.699 
again may or may not be relative to what
I'm<00:03:44.340> searching<00:03:44.850> but<00:03:45.480> if<00:03:45.720> I<00:03:45.989> find<00:03:46.290> an<00:03:46.440> article

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
I'm searching but if I find an article

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.190 
I'm searching but if I find an article
that<00:03:47.040> I<00:03:47.430> think<00:03:48.000> is<00:03:48.209> really<00:03:48.240> going<00:03:48.599> to<00:03:48.720> work<00:03:48.930> for

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
that I think is really going to work for

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.520 
that I think is really going to work for
me<00:03:49.349> I<00:03:49.550> will<00:03:50.550> know<00:03:50.760> that<00:03:51.330> it<00:03:51.599> has<00:03:52.110> a<00:03:52.140> lot<00:03:52.500> more

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
me I will know that it has a lot more

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:53.600 
me I will know that it has a lot more
validity<00:03:52.950> to<00:03:53.160> it

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
validity to it

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.230 
validity to it
because<00:03:53.730> it<00:03:53.820> has<00:03:53.970> been<00:03:54.300> reviewed<00:03:56.000> before<00:03:57.000> it

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.240 
because it has been reviewed before it

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.810 
because it has been reviewed before it
got<00:03:57.420> published<00:03:57.660> and<00:03:58.230> by<00:03:58.620> that<00:03:58.650> I<00:03:58.830> mean<00:03:58.950> there's

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 
researching into them so the first step

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.950

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:51.540 
information then go back to it so that's

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.420 
information then go back to it so that's
pretty<00:05:51.720> much<00:05:51.810> what<00:05:52.080> i'm<00:05:52.169> going<00:05:52.260> to<00:05:52.320> do<00:05:52.500> here<00:05:52.770> so

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:53.430 
pretty much what i'm going to do here so

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.270 
pretty much what i'm going to do here so
at<00:05:53.550> this<00:05:53.700> point<00:05:54.000> um<00:05:54.560> you<00:05:55.560> know<00:05:55.680> we<00:05:55.860> can<00:05:56.010> go<00:05:56.130> back
