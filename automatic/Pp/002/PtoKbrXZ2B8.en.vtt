00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.050 
we live in a very interesting time right
now<00:01:42.720> because<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.380> economy<00:01:43.979> is<00:01:44.159> so<00:01:44.759> bad<00:01:44.790> that

now because the economy is so bad that

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.990 
now because the economy is so bad that
many<00:01:45.570> people<00:01:45.930> can't<00:01:46.170> afford<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:47.220> just<00:01:47.520> allow

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
themselves to be terminated so we're in

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.109 
themselves to be terminated so we're in
a<00:01:51.899> bind<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.560> I<00:01:52.860> think<00:01:53.340> it's<00:01:53.820> my<00:01:54.000> understanding

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
a bind and I think it's my understanding

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.929 
a bind and I think it's my understanding
that<00:01:54.600> people<00:01:54.960> have<00:01:55.470> until<00:01:55.829> November<00:01:56.250> 30th<00:01:56.729> and

there are there are legislative pieces

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.780 
there are there are legislative pieces
that<00:02:00.570> are<00:02:00.719> in<00:02:00.990> action<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.950> see<00:02:02.159> if<00:02:02.399> we<00:02:02.579> can

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
that are in action to see if we can

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.929 
that are in action to see if we can

strongly support education and
empowerment<00:03:05.400> I<00:03:06.120> think<00:03:06.600> we<00:03:06.720> have<00:03:06.750> to<00:03:06.870> stop

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
empowerment I think we have to stop

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.350 
empowerment I think we have to stop
browbeating<00:03:07.620> and<00:03:08.190> beating<00:03:08.550> people<00:03:08.760> into
