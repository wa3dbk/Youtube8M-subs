this<00:03:08.790> deck<00:03:09.000> you<00:03:09.630> would<00:03:09.750> think<00:03:09.900> this<00:03:10.050> primitive

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
this deck you would think this primitive

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.320 
this deck you would think this primitive
captain<00:03:10.830> but<00:03:11.010> premium<00:03:11.400> captain<00:03:11.790> really<00:03:12.180> needs

captain but premium captain really needs

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.930 
captain but premium captain really needs
like<00:03:12.570> to<00:03:13.020> cheat<00:03:13.320> out<00:03:13.440> other<00:03:13.710> cards<00:03:14.160> you<00:03:14.790> need

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
like to cheat out other cards you need

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.850 
like to cheat out other cards you need
to<00:03:15.030> go<00:03:15.120> into<00:03:15.270> other<00:03:15.450> like<00:03:16.110> higher<00:03:16.380> converted

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
to go into other like higher converted

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:17.810 
to go into other like higher converted
mana<00:03:16.950> cost<00:03:17.100> you<00:03:17.340> need<00:03:17.460> to<00:03:17.520> go<00:03:17.610> into<00:03:17.760> other

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:48.670 
definitely be another option as we do

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:50.670

run<00:04:48.850> twelve<00:04:49.150> one<00:04:49.330> drops<00:04:49.600> and<00:04:49.960> that's<00:04:50.290> that's

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
run twelve one drops and that's that's

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.530 
run twelve one drops and that's that's
quite<00:04:50.830> a<00:04:50.920> bit<00:04:51.100> of<00:04:51.130> one<00:04:51.760> drop<00:04:51.970> see<00:04:52.120> we<00:04:52.270> could<00:04:52.390> end

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:52.540 
quite a bit of one drop see we could end

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.150 
quite a bit of one drop see we could end
up<00:04:52.570> getting<00:04:52.690> back<00:04:52.930> but<00:04:53.530> I<00:04:53.560> think<00:04:53.710> we<00:04:53.920> returned

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
up getting back but I think we returned

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.920 
up getting back but I think we returned
the<00:04:54.250> ranks<00:04:54.460> is<00:04:54.580> just<00:04:54.760> more<00:04:54.940> powerful<00:04:55.150> and<00:04:55.720> in

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
the ranks is just more powerful and in

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.630 
the ranks is just more powerful and in
fact<00:04:56.080> that<00:04:56.230> uses<00:04:56.470> both<00:04:56.650> one<00:04:56.890> and<00:04:56.920> two<00:04:57.220> drops

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:57.640 
fact that uses both one and two drops

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.510 
fact that uses both one and two drops
again<00:04:58.480> Helios<00:04:59.020> in<00:04:59.200> therefore<00:04:59.590> I'm<00:05:00.100> not<00:05:00.310> quite

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
again Helios in therefore I'm not quite

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.610 
again Helios in therefore I'm not quite
sure<00:05:00.550> where<00:05:01.030> it<00:05:01.240> puts<00:05:01.450> in<00:05:01.570> soldier<00:05:01.930> oh<00:05:02.110> it<00:05:02.440> puts

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
sure where it puts in soldier oh it puts

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
sure where it puts in soldier oh it puts
in<00:05:02.740> cleric<00:05:03.310> tokens<00:05:03.790> so<00:05:04.000> I<00:05:04.030> guess<00:05:04.330> they<00:05:04.570> did<00:05:05.290> a

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:05.640 
in cleric tokens so I guess they did a

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.310 
in cleric tokens so I guess they did a
hylia<00:05:06.640> white<00:05:07.000> cleric<00:05:07.510> tokens<00:05:07.960> for<00:05:08.200> some

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 
hylia white cleric tokens for some

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.540 
hylia white cleric tokens for some
reason<00:05:08.560> I<00:05:08.620> thought<00:05:08.770> it<00:05:08.860> was<00:05:08.980> soldier<00:05:09.220> tokens

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
reason I thought it was soldier tokens

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:10.980 
reason I thought it was soldier tokens
