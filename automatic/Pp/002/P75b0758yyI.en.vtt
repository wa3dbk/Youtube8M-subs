00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.190
 and hello everyone dear friends with you on 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.730
 welcome flash photo 2 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.779
 we keep places on the whole mine so 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:24.090
 we stayed on some kind of head 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:28.169
 wait 7 to 7 chapter called 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.450
 the victim is here as I showed you three 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:34.050
 missions first is called boards it is with us 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:37.040
 already 27 as I remember the mission yes it is 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.140
 rented mission choose normally choose 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.629
 stop we already play the first part 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.379
 pile did not understand y ride beat 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.870
 then choose bill and start the game like this 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.329
 Here are the guys and so I missed 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:56.179
 video to not delay time so 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:01:02.030
 let's say take a shotgun to it 

00:00:56.179 --> 00:01:02.030
 leaking and actually ahead the road is still 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:09.650
 clear move on the eye of the sun pin 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:14.450
 rushes 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.450
 so it is we 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.490
 so 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.980
 zombie what is this noise and why did you know 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.430
 that from the first part dudes studied not 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:31.560
 We learned that it is easier when a new mission 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:35.040
 signal stages in the first part of this 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.990
 mission was not a life of dudes 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:43.320
 primary forces with first sister 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:50.550
 participation here it is there under these 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:54.420
 the coach is good that he ducked it was 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:56.580
 epic was tough he jumps to personal 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.580
 flying really cool 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:06.810
 I saw enough of a piece of nonsense simple 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:12.660
 tooth red light is the same bridge that 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:15.540
 broke ideas in any seems like here past 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:19.760
 mission bridge at the end there you saw yourself i 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:25.590
 there are still several video outfits 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:31.640
 music looked like over destroyed 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:34.620
 on a wet spear I think one test 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:38.150
 the whole course endless ammunition a in the morning 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.150
 frame for bullets what's up 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.250
 and I pass by the eye 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:12.030
 so own silent because i don't 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.380
 it was necessary to kill zombies and when 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.200
 someone commenting on shoot at all 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:23.780
 impossible and shoot maybe just 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:29.540
 get there and maybe some without kapets 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.540
 make it laugh so we won't take concrete 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:40.790
 jerry cannâ€™t go through there 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.790
 at home who have already actually 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:49.470
 did you see this guys open the door 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:51.930
 wagon so now let's open it not 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.990
 the problem is I hope well even though when we 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.450
 we will open it will even be afraid 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:04:05.240
 imagine what it will be next 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:05.240
 open the car about and sting dude things 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:15.810
 yes let me get through this is not a joke 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:18.060
 let's save the guys an hour first aid kit and myself 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:22.980
 you have already applied your loops 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:26.190

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:32.000

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:49.870
 figasebe so he gave anointed is not important 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.870

00:04:53.909 --> 00:05:00.129
 thank God itâ€™s not me sat down we continue 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:07.659

 it seems these don't be mad at this great 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:23.590
 belts because we wander along the railway. 

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:26.460
 and that's actually epic it will be 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:31.930
 turn it on were were 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:36.250
 further that we are here to us i think here 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:37.090
 necessary because the terrain hangs when yes 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:44.740
 most likely here 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:50.650
 she would return here if I have to sing 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:55.030
 we are a little bit brick for us 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:57.580
 you have to shout and bricks of your own 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:06:03.610
 making bricks guys and all extinct 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:04.289

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:07.719
 demand 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:08.529
 joked bricks but I meant that 

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:11.770
 such furnaces 

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:13.990
 they make here and now bricks can 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:15.909
 don't wait because in this city zombie 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:18.150
