00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.609
 money in the halo okay I'm going to lower this 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:48.719
 a little bit because no interference to 

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:48.719

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:55.730

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:58.579
 you have to turn on and turn on the halo 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.530

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.659
 windows 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.820
 that does not work for me another way is 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.939
 give double click that means the 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.090
