00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.990 

this<00:00:37.930> technology<00:00:38.590> we<00:00:39.040> have<00:00:39.160> patency<00:00:39.700> but<00:00:39.879> it's

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
this technology we have patency but it's

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.610 
this technology we have patency but it's
not<00:00:40.149> like<00:00:40.420> when<00:00:40.629> you're<00:00:40.840> running<00:00:41.079> them<00:00:41.410> but

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
not like when you're running them but

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.660 
not like when you're running them but
that's<00:00:42.160> been<00:00:42.489> deconstructing<00:00:43.270> their<00:00:43.390> ties

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
that's been deconstructing their ties

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.549 
that's been deconstructing their ties
but<00:00:45.670> our<00:00:45.910> biggest<00:00:46.149> motivation<00:00:47.079> has<00:00:47.350> always

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 
but our biggest motivation has always

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:49.619 
but our biggest motivation has always
been<00:00:47.829> showing<00:00:48.309> the<00:00:48.399> fantastic<00:00:48.969> properties<00:00:49.450> of

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:49.629 
been showing the fantastic properties of

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:51.840 
been showing the fantastic properties of
this<00:00:49.750> material<00:00:50.320> by<00:00:50.739> creating<00:00:51.340> a<00:00:51.489> retail

product we want to make sure this
technology<00:00:54.879> reaches<00:00:55.239> you<00:00:55.390> and<00:00:55.539> doesn't<00:00:55.930> gets

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
technology reaches you and doesn't gets

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.310 
technology reaches you and doesn't gets
restricted<00:00:56.739> to<00:00:56.860> industrial<00:00:57.370> applications<00:00:58.320> so

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
restricted to industrial applications so

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.010 
restricted to industrial applications so
so<00:00:59.829> yeah<00:01:00.129> for<00:01:00.340> this<00:01:00.460> year<00:01:00.730> our<00:01:00.940> team<00:01:01.270> of<00:01:01.660> the

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020 
so yeah for this year our team of the

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.479 
so yeah for this year our team of the
helpers<00:01:02.379> young<00:01:02.620> designers<00:01:03.160> have<00:01:03.460> been

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
helpers young designers have been

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:05.490 
helpers young designers have been
working<00:01:04.089> to<00:01:04.239> make<00:01:04.420> entire<00:01:04.839> soles<00:01:05.199> new

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
working to make entire soles new

Footwear<00:01:05.830> hey<00:01:06.450> excuse<00:01:07.450> me

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
Footwear hey excuse me

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.710 
Footwear hey excuse me
so<00:01:08.680> we<00:01:08.860> have<00:01:08.950> created<00:01:09.130> tire<00:01:09.700> flops<00:01:10.030> by

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
so we have created tire flops by

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.539 
so we have created tire flops by
bringing<00:01:11.020> together<00:01:11.260> comfort<00:01:12.010> durability

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:12.549 
bringing together comfort durability

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:16.020 
bringing together comfort durability
grip<00:01:13.420> lightness<00:01:14.110> and<00:01:14.290> wear<00:01:14.590> resistance<00:01:15.130> but

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
grip lightness and wear resistance but

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.609 
grip lightness and wear resistance but
we<00:01:16.299> did<00:01:16.479> not<00:01:16.630> just<00:01:16.780> want<00:01:16.960> to<00:01:17.140> come<00:01:17.320> up<00:01:17.439> with<00:01:17.590> a

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
we did not just want to come up with a

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:19.980 
we did not just want to come up with a
pair<00:01:17.950> of<00:01:17.979> high-tech<00:01:18.460> flip-flops<00:01:19.000> we<00:01:19.659> bonded

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
pair of high-tech flip-flops we bonded

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.020 
pair of high-tech flip-flops we bonded
them<00:01:20.110> to<00:01:20.290> look<00:01:20.439> cool<00:01:20.710> and<00:01:20.920> simple<00:01:21.220> and<00:01:21.610> we<00:01:21.939> are

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
them to look cool and simple and we are

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.020 
them to look cool and simple and we are
very<00:01:22.210> happy<00:01:22.420> with<00:01:22.689> the<00:01:22.810> result<00:01:23.580> but<00:01:24.580> let's<00:01:24.820> go

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
very happy with the result but let's go

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.749 
very happy with the result but let's go
