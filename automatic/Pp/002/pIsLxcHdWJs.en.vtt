00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
here and the basic brief on this bike

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.720 
here and the basic brief on this bike
was<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.750> make<00:00:21.869> a<00:00:21.900> modern<00:00:22.320> metal<00:00:22.619> road<00:00:22.859> bike<00:00:23.070> and

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
was to make a modern metal road bike and

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.550 
was to make a modern metal road bike and
to<00:00:23.910> make<00:00:24.029> it<00:00:24.060> in<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.539> true<00:00:24.840> American<00:00:25.380> hot<00:00:25.529> rod

to make it in a true American hot rod

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.339 
to make it in a true American hot rod
spirit<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:26.970> so<00:00:27.150> this<00:00:27.480> model<00:00:27.779> is<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.050> titanium

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
that came out of Detroit in the 60s in

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.100 
that came out of Detroit in the 60s in
the<00:00:34.320> 70s<00:00:34.770> where<00:00:35.370> he<00:00:35.430> basically<00:00:35.730> took<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:37.020> know

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
the 70s where he basically took you know

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.510 
the 70s where he basically took you know
a<00:00:37.140> model<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:37.739> you<00:00:37.800> stripped<00:00:38.100> everything<00:00:38.219> off

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
a model and you stripped everything off

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.130 
a model and you stripped everything off
that<00:00:38.879> you<00:00:38.969> didn't<00:00:39.239> need<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.629> just<00:00:39.750> made<00:00:39.899> it<00:00:40.020> as

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
that you didn't need and just made it as

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.799 
that you didn't need and just made it as
fast<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.649> aggressive<00:00:40.770> as<00:00:41.100> possible<00:00:41.180> and<00:00:42.180> so<00:00:42.450> I

for<00:04:14.620> us<00:04:14.709> is<00:04:14.920> to<00:04:15.040> make<00:04:15.070> a<00:04:15.220> bike<00:04:15.519> that<00:04:16.030> doesn't

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
for us is to make a bike that doesn't

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.599 
for us is to make a bike that doesn't
look<00:04:16.630> like<00:04:16.870> a<00:04:16.900> modern<00:04:17.380> bike<00:04:17.620> it<00:04:17.859> looks<00:04:18.070> like<00:04:18.280> an

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
look like a modern bike it looks like an

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.210 
look like a modern bike it looks like an
if'<00:04:18.940> from<00:04:19.209> a<00:04:19.269> distance<00:04:19.660> and<00:04:20.229> so<00:04:20.530> everything

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
if' from a distance and so everything

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:22.920 
if' from a distance and so everything
from<00:04:21.280> the<00:04:21.370> tube<00:04:21.640> shapes<00:04:21.970> to<00:04:22.270> the<00:04:22.360> way<00:04:22.510> the

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
from the tube shapes to the way the

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.930 
from the tube shapes to the way the
frame<00:04:23.500> is<00:04:23.650> engineered<00:04:24.070> with<00:04:24.310> the<00:04:24.370> lugs<00:04:24.610> the

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
frame is engineered with the lugs the

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.760 
frame is engineered with the lugs the
tutelage<00:04:25.330> construction<00:04:25.930> you<00:04:26.440> get<00:04:26.560> a<00:04:26.590> really

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
tutelage construction you get a really

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.409 
tutelage construction you get a really
strong<00:04:26.919> bike<00:04:27.430> without<00:04:27.669> having<00:04:28.000> to<00:04:28.060> have<00:04:28.150> a<00:04:28.210> lot

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 
strong bike without having to have a lot

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:29.969 
strong bike without having to have a lot
of<00:04:28.450> mass<00:04:28.720> in<00:04:28.930> the<00:04:28.960> bottom<00:04:29.260> bracket<00:04:29.350> area<00:04:29.830> or

of mass in the bottom bracket area or

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:32.490 
of mass in the bottom bracket area or
the<00:04:30.070> head<00:04:30.190> tube<00:04:30.400> area<00:04:31.050> this<00:04:32.050> bike<00:04:32.289> has<00:04:32.440> been

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
the head tube area this bike has been

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.350 
the head tube area this bike has been
through<00:04:32.860> all<00:04:32.979> five<00:04:33.220> of<00:04:33.250> the<00:04:33.490> cen<00:04:33.850> standards

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
through all five of the cen standards

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.700 
through all five of the cen standards
and<00:04:34.510> passed<00:04:34.690> with<00:04:34.930> flying<00:04:35.050> colors<00:04:35.229> it's<00:04:35.650> a

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
and passed with flying colors it's a

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.710 
and passed with flying colors it's a
really<00:04:35.890> strong<00:04:36.130> frame<00:04:36.520> and<00:04:37.090> like<00:04:37.450> I<00:04:37.479> said

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
really strong frame and like I said

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.150 
really strong frame and like I said
we've<00:04:37.870> we've<00:04:38.380> had<00:04:38.410> him<00:04:38.620> on<00:04:38.680> the<00:04:38.770> road<00:04:38.919> for<00:04:39.130> a

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
we've we've had him on the road for a

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.590 
we've we've had him on the road for a
couple<00:04:39.430> years<00:04:39.460> and<00:04:39.820> Molly<00:04:40.000> raced<00:04:40.270> them<00:04:40.450> all

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
couple years and Molly raced them all

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.110 
couple years and Molly raced them all
all<00:04:41.289> this<00:04:41.380> past<00:04:41.590> cross<00:04:41.860> season

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
all this past cross season

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.159 
all this past cross season
we're<00:04:43.300> really<00:04:43.419> happy<00:04:43.660> with<00:04:43.780> the<00:04:43.960> way<00:04:44.050> it's

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:44.169 
we're really happy with the way it's

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:48.090 
we're really happy with the way it's
come<00:04:44.290> out<00:04:44.410> so<00:04:45.389> it's<00:04:46.389> I<00:04:46.840> guess<00:04:47.590> it's<00:04:47.770> built<00:04:47.950> up

are teen pounds in fact the freewheel

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.080 
are teen pounds in fact the freewheel
here<00:04:53.620> weighs<00:04:53.770> as<00:04:53.919> much<00:04:53.950> as<00:04:54.100> a<00:04:54.280> frame<00:04:54.520> you<00:04:54.820> know

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
here weighs as much as a frame you know

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.270 
here weighs as much as a frame you know
classic<00:04:55.600> classic<00:04:56.169> Phil<00:04:56.380> it's<00:04:56.620> it's<00:04:57.130> pretty

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
classic classic Phil it's it's pretty
