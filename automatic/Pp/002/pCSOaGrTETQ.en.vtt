00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 tell us about her 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.029
 Dyeing how long has she been like ? 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.809
 many eggs color we are the Ã¶bb 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.820
 have been there for 60 years 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.809
 year my grandfather has the alpha 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.400
 established area 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:19.199
 in Lower Bavaria in the 50s and 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.820
 just started trading 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.710
 The raw eggs have been trading at some point 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.990
 just before easter for personal use 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.640
 dyed colorful eggs and has someday 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.820
 started to color on eggs 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.769
 Specializing has special machines 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.750
 my father has developed then 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.620
 sometime in the 70's in 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.200
 Augsburg of a dye works that was in 1976 and 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.210
 In 1981 we moved outside 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.950
 and since then we are sitting in here 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.360
 than live 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.809
 Two years ago, my husband and I have 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.719
 The company was taken over by my parents 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:54.030
 and lead it all in now 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:57.690
 same way continue the special 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.390
 our eggs is that we have the eggs in 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.969
 steaming so we put very big 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.030
 Worth the even way that the eggs 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.430
 be cooked very gently and that he 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.869
 There is not cooked very hard but 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.460
 Work really soft is also really soft 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.110
 we with a lot of staff so we 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.740
 still have a lot of manual labor 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:23.100
 can thus also ensure that 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.570
 as little break as possible or just the 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.720
 are not quite in the 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.340
 pack so we sort 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.159
 everything from what is not optimal and 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.310
 so can a special quality 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.130
 to guarantee 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.659
 where does their eggs come from and deliver to whom? 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.900
 they sell their bonds 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.530
 eggs 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:43.049
 We have two big areas of one 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.990
 range are eggs dealers chicken farmers 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.570
 that come from the larger environment and 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.310
 deliver your own eggs here with us 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.909
 cook and stain and then again 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.460
 pick up 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.360
 the second area are the eggs we 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.479
 to buy 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.869
 We buy peace of mind and process it 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.759
 to advertise cooking and sell themselves here 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.829
 at the house we have very very big house 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.060
 meanwhile, sell over the years 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.610
 there is a lot of growth, people are coming 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.740
 from quite a distance how many eggs 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.120
 Then dye them here every day 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:16.450
 that's not so easy to say so 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.130
 We dye every day only order 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.880
 depending so we do not make any progress 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.680
 production 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.750
 That is, at the beginning of January if we 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.780
 The days are still relatively short 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.330
 and jena east moves the longer be 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.860
 to dye the working days and more often 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.930
 So every week we are now three 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:35.580
 four weeks before easter we produce 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.660
 every day we can circa in the hour 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:41.110
 Produce 17,000 eggs 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:44.620
 In the daytime it is now direct in time 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.600
 before easter about 200,000 and how 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.209
 For a long time your eggs are stable and how 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:53.590
 These are preserved by our eggs 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:55.510
 are about 28 days shelf life officially in 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.180
 they also keep a lot of practice 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:01.209
 longer because our color is it 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.459
 alcohol-based food colors and 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:06.040
 they are offset with popal and this 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:08.310
 composer baumharz and takes care of that 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.720
 that the eggs shine beautifully 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.110
 and also that the marriage is more durable 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:16.670
 so they are conserved and 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.670
 stay fresh just longer
