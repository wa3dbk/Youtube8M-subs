you see if there's any clumping you were
talking<00:00:17.070> about<00:00:17.250> so<00:00:17.400> it's<00:00:17.520> one<00:00:17.640> scoop<00:00:17.880> per

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
talking about so it's one scoop per

talking about so it's one scoop per
serving<00:00:18.420> six<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.380> eight<00:00:19.470> ounces<00:00:19.619> of<00:00:19.859> water<00:00:19.920> so

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
protein isolates is their primary source

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.250 
protein isolates is their primary source
but<00:00:27.869> they<00:00:27.930> also<00:00:28.080> have<00:00:29.269> they<00:00:30.269> have<00:00:30.810> filters<00:00:31.170> in

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
but they also have they have filters in

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.020 
but they also have they have filters in
just<00:00:31.470> like<00:00:31.560> every<00:00:31.830> other<00:00:31.890> company<00:00:32.309> does<00:00:32.340> the

calories<00:00:44.040> per<00:00:44.219> serving<00:00:44.550> so<00:00:44.760> first<00:00:45.090> group<00:00:45.300> um

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
calories per serving so first group um

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.290 
calories per serving so first group um
it's<00:00:46.649> not<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:46.950> it's<00:00:47.579> I<00:00:47.820> don't<00:00:48.000> want<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.180> rich

can't stand every as you know I'm not a
talking<00:00:55.379> thing<00:00:55.410> um<00:00:56.250> so<00:00:56.489> this<00:00:56.910> is<00:00:56.969> 15<00:00:57.449> servings

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
talking thing um so this is 15 servings

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.450 
talking thing um so this is 15 servings
right<00:00:58.050> here<00:00:58.230> this<00:00:58.410> little<00:00:58.680> one<00:00:58.800> cup<00:00:58.980> for

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
right here this little one cup for

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.610 
right here this little one cup for
private<00:00:59.760> eight<00:00:59.879> or<00:01:00.000> so<00:01:00.120> doing<00:01:00.329> that<00:01:00.449> bad<00:01:00.660> so

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
private eight or so doing that bad so

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.120 
private eight or so doing that bad so
here's<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.890> scoop<00:01:02.190> I'm<00:01:03.090> not<00:01:03.480> poured<00:01:03.809> in<00:01:03.930> here

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:15.320 

so<00:01:09.110> it<00:01:10.110> kind<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.530> sits<00:01:10.770> on<00:01:10.920> top<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:12.350> top<00:01:14.330> muscle

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
so it kind of sits on top the top muscle

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.410 
so it kind of sits on top the top muscle
juice<00:01:15.540> mass<00:01:16.170> gainer<00:01:16.759> sinks<00:01:17.759> all<00:01:17.970> straight<00:01:18.299> to

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
juice mass gainer sinks all straight to

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.859 
juice mass gainer sinks all straight to
the<00:01:18.509> bottom

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
the bottom

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.840 
the bottom
this<00:01:19.080> one<00:01:19.229> floats<00:01:19.439> on<00:01:19.590> top<00:01:19.830> I<00:01:20.250> don't<00:01:20.729> know<00:01:20.790> if

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
this one floats on top I don't know if

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.249 
this one floats on top I don't know if
that's<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.030> good<00:01:21.119> thing<00:01:21.180> or<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.420> bad<00:01:21.450> thing<00:01:21.600> it

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
that's a good thing or a bad thing it

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.530 
that's a good thing or a bad thing it
might<00:01:22.470> be<00:01:22.680> good<00:01:23.030> might<00:01:24.030> just<00:01:24.270> mean<00:01:24.360> there's

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
might be good might just mean there's

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.940 
might be good might just mean there's
less<00:01:24.720> dense<00:01:24.930> in<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.140> water<00:01:25.350> so<00:01:25.590> that<00:01:25.710> makes<00:01:25.890> a

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
less dense in the water so that makes a

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:39.940 
less dense in the water so that makes a
little<00:01:26.130> better<00:01:26.280> add<00:01:26.670> enough

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.360 

so<00:01:40.490> there<00:01:40.640> it<00:01:40.820> is<00:01:40.909> right<00:01:40.970> there<00:01:42.190> for<00:01:43.190> whatever

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:43.370 
so there it is right there for whatever

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.360 
so there it is right there for whatever
reason<00:01:43.940> it<00:01:44.600> does<00:01:44.900> leave<00:01:45.200> some<00:01:45.800> sort<00:01:46.040> of<00:01:46.070> black

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.370 
reason it does leave some sort of black

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.530 
reason it does leave some sort of black
chunks<00:01:46.880> in<00:01:47.000> the<00:01:47.060> bottle<00:01:47.360> but<00:01:47.920> uh<00:01:48.920> I<00:01:49.369> mean<00:01:50.180> other

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
chunks in the bottle but uh I mean other

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:51.880 
chunks in the bottle but uh I mean other
than<00:01:50.630> effort<00:01:51.080> they're<00:01:51.260> pretty<00:01:51.440> small<00:01:51.770> I<00:01:51.800> mean

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
than effort they're pretty small I mean

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.800 
than effort they're pretty small I mean
II<00:01:52.220> don't<00:01:52.340> really<00:01:52.550> film<00:01:52.909> now<00:01:53.060> that<00:01:53.270> much<00:01:53.479> other

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
II don't really film now that much other

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.570 
II don't really film now that much other
than<00:01:53.869> that<00:01:54.080> there's<00:01:54.320> no<00:01:54.470> powder<00:01:54.979> in<00:01:55.159> trunks<00:01:55.490> I

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
than that there's no powder in trunks I

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.900 
than that there's no powder in trunks I
don't<00:01:55.760> think<00:01:56.590> you<00:01:57.590> want<00:01:57.770> to<00:01:57.800> go<00:01:57.920> now<00:01:58.610> I'm<00:01:58.700> good

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910 
don't think you want to go now I'm good

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:59.170 
don't think you want to go now I'm good

it's a good protein I thought about a

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.590 
it's a good protein I thought about a
use<00:02:36.170> for<00:02:36.440> it

Scott<00:02:38.600> takes<00:02:38.780> so<00:02:38.900> much<00:02:39.019> protein<00:02:39.380> in<00:02:39.500> my<00:02:39.590> diet

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
Scott takes so much protein in my diet

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.310

to<00:02:40.130> my<00:02:40.220> mass<00:02:40.430> gainers<00:02:40.880> in<00:02:41.030> my<00:02:41.180> eye<00:02:41.420> food<00:02:42.170> in

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
to my mass gainers in my eye food in

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.410 
to my mass gainers in my eye food in
general<00:02:42.650> I<00:02:42.830> do<00:02:43.220> throw<00:02:43.580> it<00:02:43.700> another<00:02:43.940> mask<00:02:44.180> and

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
general I do throw it another mask and

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.170 
general I do throw it another mask and
occasionally<00:02:45.160> it's<00:02:46.160> always<00:02:46.340> good<00:02:46.459> to<00:02:46.519> get<00:02:47.150> a

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
occasionally it's always good to get a

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.199 
occasionally it's always good to get a
little<00:02:47.209> extra<00:02:47.450> protein<00:02:47.660> so<00:02:48.549> not<00:02:49.549> a<00:02:49.579> big<00:02:49.760> deal

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
little extra protein so not a big deal

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.729 
little extra protein so not a big deal
um<00:02:51.519> so<00:02:52.600> that<00:02:53.600> part<00:02:53.840> of<00:02:53.870> a<00:02:54.079> pro<00:02:54.260> can't<00:02:54.500> stick

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
um so that part of a pro can't stick

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.250 
um so that part of a pro can't stick
with<00:02:54.920> for<00:02:54.950> now<00:02:55.450> we'll<00:02:56.450> see<00:02:56.630> what<00:02:56.900> all<00:02:57.140> my

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
with for now we'll see what all my

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.860 
with for now we'll see what all my
