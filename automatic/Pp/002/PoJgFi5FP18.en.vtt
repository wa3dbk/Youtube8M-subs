tousled<00:05:20.380> and<00:05:20.970> I<00:05:21.970> think<00:05:22.389> the<00:05:22.509> gel<00:05:22.780> holds<00:05:23.289> up

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.410 
tousled and I think the gel holds up

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.439 
tousled and I think the gel holds up
pretty<00:05:23.440> well<00:05:23.710> against<00:05:24.250> headbands<00:05:24.849> improves

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:25.449 
pretty well against headbands improves

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:27.510 
pretty well against headbands improves
the<00:05:25.660> messing<00:05:26.020> around<00:05:26.139> with<00:05:26.500> it<00:05:26.680> and<00:05:26.979> I'm

the messing around with it and I'm

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.930 
the messing around with it and I'm
confident<00:05:28.060> to<00:05:28.240> say<00:05:28.270> that<00:05:28.750> it<00:05:29.020> will<00:05:29.169> probably

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 
confident to say that it will probably

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.740 
confident to say that it will probably
will<00:05:30.940> keep<00:05:31.270> for<00:05:31.510> another<00:05:31.780> day<00:05:32.050> so<00:05:32.849> looking<00:05:33.849> at

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
will keep for another day so looking at

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:38.040 
will keep for another day so looking at
day<00:05:35.139> or<00:05:35.560> two<00:05:35.860> out<00:05:36.370> of<00:05:36.430> using<00:05:37.360> eco<00:05:37.630> styler<00:05:37.840> gel

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.050 
day or two out of using eco styler gel

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:40.860 
day or two out of using eco styler gel
and<00:05:38.530> that's<00:05:38.710> pretty<00:05:39.039> good<00:05:39.250> and<00:05:39.639> perhaps<00:05:40.360> third

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:40.870 
and that's pretty good and perhaps third

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:45.210 
and that's pretty good and perhaps third
day<00:05:41.110> I'll<00:05:42.510> condition<00:05:43.510> or<00:05:44.080> just<00:05:44.710> wash<00:05:44.919> it<00:05:44.949> again

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:45.220 
day I'll condition or just wash it again

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.510 
day I'll condition or just wash it again
and<00:05:45.699> use<00:05:45.909> something<00:05:46.300> else<00:05:46.419> and<00:05:47.020> I'm<00:05:47.520> thinking

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520 
and use something else and I'm thinking

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.450 
and use something else and I'm thinking
maybe<00:05:49.060> the<00:05:49.870> next<00:05:50.169> product<00:05:50.740> with<00:05:50.949> view<00:05:51.220> would

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.460 
maybe the next product with view would

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.779 
maybe the next product with view would
be<00:05:51.490> Shea<00:05:52.270> Moisture<00:05:52.479> I<00:05:53.050> do<00:05:53.770> have<00:05:54.159> the<00:05:54.280> shampoo
