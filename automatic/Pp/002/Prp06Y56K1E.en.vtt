00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.150
 Well, I know what we're going to do is 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.520
 observe directly epidermis from 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.529
 such with this more is very easy because 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.210
 this plant that opposed from places 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.340
 total keys in quarry guaranteed by 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.810
 there in a plant that is observed very 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.050
 easily and from that factor all 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.090
 we started a line of these two rounds 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.779
 and then now what it's about is 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.600
 that tear des is about separating or 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:37.110
 middle epi or goblins and cut a 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:40.559
 fragment with a scissor look here in 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:44.160
 this little piece that you can see if there is a 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:47.309
 zone of white epidermis and is epidermis 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.370
 she that we are going now to prepare with the 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.460
 pazos scissors please 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.770
 and we have to put a cake a drop 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.920
 of water that we focus positive from 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:05.070
 small medium and large increase 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.070
 they should know that the partners of a brush 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.470
 we have a drop of water with a bottle 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.470
 washer 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:22.280
 we place to sell edito we put a covers 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.280
 over with cover 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:37.380
 we try to notice in 2002 that air 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.380
 using lightly with a brush 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:45.330
 and now the positive of 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.330
 small and medium 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.380
 we'll see 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.210
 the other direct 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.909
 we touch here peace and lousteau 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.410
 and biased goodbye 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:31.810
 or not 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.810
 a little 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:42.069
 well as you can see this 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.470
 so tan sinxela tearing off and a piece 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:47.680
 FariÃ±a stretching can not carry 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.000
 observe this network of cells that 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.250
 cause behaviors that constitute 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.690
 that half polyp api disclose I of 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:59.110
 everywhere the typical here nos nosos 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:01.599
 that area in galicia really look like that 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.910
 that mosaic of cells without chlorophyll 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:06.459
 but they are interrupted from when in 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.640
 once for these cells to kidney fairies that 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:12.489
 an organ what we call it is take that 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.579
 sixth more are come face a man 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:18.579
 these phobias sometimes mind predominates 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:22.150
 best but it's easy to observe in 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:23.440
 any green plant to that epidermis 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.870
 concretely here in polyp god 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.299
 observe those doubts in great detail 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:31.900
 cells in the form of reel that dex 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:34.840
 hole that is called oyster 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.659
 and those river- shaped cells are 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.659
 they call da dada cells they are also 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:43.920
 called occlusive cells are surrounded 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:48.180
 by the accompanying cells 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:50.520
 this this structure will allow 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.010
 an exchange of gases with outside the 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:56.069
 cell normally in exchange 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.840
 co2 oxygen and outside during the seek 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:00.270
 process of photosynthesis but by the 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.730
 stomata colosium concretely also 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.830
 is going to exchange aud to the 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.569
 plants go lose algae is produced by 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:10.920
 so through tel is what we call 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:14.370
 to transpiration evapotranspiration 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.840
 because of this or state do is take varies 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.299
 depending on the conditions 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.370
 physiological of the plant itself 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:24.000
 climatic conditions for example a 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:26.880
 dry day with a luminous intensity 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.160
 strong the plant page aos seus this more 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.790
 and therefore we are going to see you have 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:35.790
 started to form water while a 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:37.530
 better on a wet day because the plant 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.530
 is in greatest exchange especially of 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:43.320
 water or gas itself depending on 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.530
 this physiological state of this is going to 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.530
 change 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:53.280
 Increase xamais can now be appreciated 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:55.590
 even what cells is themed 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.900
 even the abusive ones can be observed 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.900
 perfectly the presence of great 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.880
 number of crowded chloroplasts that are 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.730
 that sort of green organelles that 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.920
 we see by the preparation and also we 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:10.350
 can detect the presence of nucleus 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.970
 more than veil guessed because an area 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.130
 as more clear that it appears quite 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.130
 centered we are not exclusive in these 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:19.890
 images is observed in quite detail 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:21.630
 that means that the cells in the 

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:23.670
 automatic cells will perform 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.830
 photosynthesis are active and contrast 

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:28.080
 Epidermal widely with fabrics that you 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.300
 they accompany with being balls with 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.920
 neighboring cells because these are cells 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.140
 Epidermal that what happens light 

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.240
 through the are cells that do not 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:39.380
 they present chloroplasts and that's why 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:42.790
 you see that structure so transparent 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:45.650
 by the dem indicate forest open two 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:48.680
 this more you have to look at mary cells 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:50.990
 systematic that from a few 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:54.920
 Asymmetric divisions form 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:57.500
 systematic cells that also have 

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.820
 an inner elastic wall and greater 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:02.300
 thickness that external that a 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:04.490
 important feature that is explained 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.440
 well or peche opening mechanism 2 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:08.180
 this more there are several types of this more 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.620
 depending on the cells 2 that 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.210
 treat and we can auto for 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.840
 practically in all tissues 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.840
 green
