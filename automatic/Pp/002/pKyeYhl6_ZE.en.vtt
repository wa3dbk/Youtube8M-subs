00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:21.700
 Hello dear friends at the microphone 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.460
 winters in this video consider this 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.590
 a tank like 40 is an italian mainstream 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.510
 battle tank which was once direct 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.310
 and now he is on the development branch 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.500
 fourth level supplier 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.200
 Sophie golf consider it more 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.079
 let's start with the reservation and so 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.090
 hull armor is 70 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.070
 millimeters and this figure applies 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.470
 WLD or top frontal part 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.410
 which is at a good angle and 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:50.020
 ricochet neatly boards and feed like 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.900
 Nolda armored herself is very weak and 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.180
 makes it easy enough but here 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.980
 nothing new but the tower deserve 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.740
 attention tower armor in the forehead 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.110
 is 150 millimeters seemingly 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:04.629
 This is a little bit due to the modifier. 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.640
 mask shapes and and corners punch us in 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.770
 frontal projection of the tower will need more 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.360
 try, therefore, to correct damage 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.820
 the tower is quite real 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.920
 the sides of the turret have armor in 180 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.290
 mm which is also very nice to have 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.770
 us installed 100 5 millimeter 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.400
 tool 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.540
 which scatter is 0.11 and it is good 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.000
 indicator for experience and 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.950
 which means it is quite capable of shooting like 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.060
 on average so long range with 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.790
 high precision 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.920
 about mix to 2.32 second only 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.670
 add to our confidence a tool to 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.200
 everything else 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.409
 has nice vertical guidance angles 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.540
 at -9 degrees which allows us confidently 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.460
 enjoy the terrain to choose from 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.710
 three types of shells opera 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.330
 subcaliber cumulative and high explosive 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.920
 shells pierce and tackle 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.610
 is two hundred and fifty nine 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.479
 millimeters 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:55.210
 alpha is equal to 269 enets better 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.799
 only t-64 cumulative we are able 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.380
 to put 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.970
 368 damage over two hundred 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.650
 forty two millimeters and this is quite 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.720
 enough to deal with 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.750
 light armored land mines 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:11.319
 capable of dealing almost 180 damage 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.540
 and if they break through all 270 in stock 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:15.849
 state of recharge is seven 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.830
 as much as one tenth of a second but due to 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:19.659
 crew and commander skills as well 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.810
 proper equipment recharge 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:24.200
 can be reduced to 5.2 seconds and this 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.239
 pretty decent result 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.849
 set power on the commander as 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:30.290
 and the bar on the crew I do not recommend so 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:32.750
 as they give very insignificant 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.580
 reduced recharge of all three hundredths 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.709
 for energy and 1 sata drank a 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.599
 bars better put where to stew 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.930
 Or it will be a better solution. 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:43.459
 acceleration to thirty- two kilometers per hour 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.050
 going on for six forty seven tenths 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.810
 seconds and maximum speed 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.640
 is almost 60 kilometers per hour and 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.630
 it allows us to borrow more 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.209
 advantageous positions 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.230
 the speed of rotation of the tower a little less than 21 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.440
 degrees per second 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.690
 only worse at t-64 and it is very 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.349
 significant minus of this tank but with 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.390
 strength we have everything ok we ok 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:08.180
 1375 and this is the best figure among both 3 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:12.110
 4 levels invisibility have even 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.760
 0.1 but a survey of 342 meters is still not 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.590
 allows us to illuminate the enemy 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.380
 first so the style of the game is more 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.420
 resemble a branch of light tanks where are you for 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.640
 you try to realize the accuracy account 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.340
 all the advantages of his ruby and in the final 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.290
 As a result, our PDM has four available 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.299
 equipment slots one of which 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.760
 universal as well as slots on 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:33.260
 security mobility and equipment on 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.239
 mobility is best delivered 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.340
 oil cooling to increase 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.290
 the rotational speed of the tower and a crackdown on 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.420
 security to establish a military matter is not 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.760
 which will increase your body strength 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.680
 she equip to put the communication system 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.690
 which increases crew skills 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.519
 universal slot is better to use 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.010
 similar power and install stabilizer 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:53.209
 and increasing the recharge rate and 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.489
 aiming time 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:58.010
 summing up the tank as a whole is pretty 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:00.440
 comfortable good maneuverability fast 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.569
 reloading the exact weapon of the main 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.819
 cons still worth noting speed 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:06.709
 rotation of the turret of the tank especially enjoy 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:09.349
 those who first of all appreciate the instrument 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:10.880
 dpm and v.n. although everyone has their own style 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:12.650
 games and you have the right to change your 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.190
 discretion as crew skills or 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.500
 commander 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:18.019
 so I hope the equipment itself 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:22.539
 review was useful to you with you was the crown 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:22.539
 once all successful battles and bye bye
