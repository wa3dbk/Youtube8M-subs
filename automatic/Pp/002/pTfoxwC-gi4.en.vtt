be<00:00:38.370> too<00:00:38.670> heavy

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.430

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
the egg will become paler and sick and

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.770 
the egg will become paler and sick and
an<00:01:03.830> issue<00:01:04.129> girl<00:01:04.519> little<00:01:04.879> by<00:01:05.000> little<00:01:05.239> while

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
an issue girl little by little while

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.500 
an issue girl little by little while
keep<00:01:06.140> on<00:01:06.350> beating<00:01:06.710> the<00:01:06.920> egg<00:01:07.280> for<00:01:07.670> another<00:01:08.060> 5

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
keep on beating the egg for another 5

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:14.499 
keep on beating the egg for another 5
minutes<00:01:08.780> I<00:01:11.170> use<00:01:12.170> the<00:01:12.350> mixture<00:01:12.710> of<00:01:13.390> brown<00:01:14.390> sugar

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
minutes I use the mixture of brown sugar

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:17.109 
minutes I use the mixture of brown sugar
or<00:01:15.259> white<00:01:15.590> sugar<00:01:15.650> with<00:01:16.369> the<00:01:16.400> palm<00:01:16.759> sugar

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
or white sugar with the palm sugar

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.530 
or white sugar with the palm sugar
because<00:01:17.720> the<00:01:17.750> palm<00:01:18.229> sugar<00:01:18.560> has<00:01:19.070> a<00:01:19.540> distinct

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
because the palm sugar has a distinct

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.620 
because the palm sugar has a distinct
change<00:01:20.660> that<00:01:21.259> it's<00:01:21.560> a<00:01:21.800> bit<00:01:22.009> caramely<00:01:22.670> so<00:01:23.300> I'd

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
change that it's a bit caramely so I'd

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.139 
change that it's a bit caramely so I'd
like<00:01:23.869> that<00:01:24.080> change<00:01:24.380> so<00:01:24.649> I<00:01:24.890> use<00:01:25.190> palm<00:01:25.460> sugar<00:01:25.729> but

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.149 
like that change so I use palm sugar but

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:28.150 
like that change so I use palm sugar but
if<00:01:26.300> you<00:01:26.390> can't<00:01:26.600> have<00:01:26.690> fun<00:01:26.720> come<00:01:27.470> sugar<00:01:27.860> you<00:01:27.979> can

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.160 
if you can't have fun come sugar you can

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.120 
if you can't have fun come sugar you can
use<00:01:28.220> brown<00:01:28.369> sugar<00:01:28.640> instead<00:01:29.180> add<00:01:30.130> another

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
use brown sugar instead add another

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.160 
use brown sugar instead add another
tablespoon<00:01:31.610> of<00:01:31.910> sugar<00:01:32.090> when<00:01:32.570> the<00:01:32.690> sugar<00:01:32.990> has
