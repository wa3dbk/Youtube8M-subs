milspec<00:01:58.110> components<00:01:58.800> out<00:01:58.920> there<00:01:59.220> it<00:02:00.060> actually

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
milspec components out there it actually

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.080 
milspec components out there it actually
uses<00:02:00.750> Magpul<00:02:01.470> factory<00:02:02.010> t<00:02:02.310> nuts<00:02:02.520> so<00:02:02.820> they're

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
uses Magpul factory t nuts so they're

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.430 
uses Magpul factory t nuts so they're
straight<00:02:03.330> from<00:02:03.510> Magpul<00:02:03.930> so<00:02:04.200> there's<00:02:04.380> a

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
straight from Magpul so there's a

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.860 
straight from Magpul so there's a
guaranteed<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:05.010> be<00:02:05.160> in<00:02:05.280> spec<00:02:05.580> and<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.420> screws

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870 
guaranteed to be in spec and the screws

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.090 
guaranteed to be in spec and the screws
that<00:02:07.050> they're<00:02:07.230> using<00:02:07.410> on<00:02:07.680> there<00:02:07.830> which<00:02:08.010> are

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
that they're using on there which are

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.460 
that they're using on there which are
marked<00:02:08.340> arson<00:02:08.790> machine<00:02:09.119> are<00:02:09.360> actually<00:02:10.050> black

oxide<00:02:10.980> treated<00:02:11.490> steel<00:02:11.940> bolts<00:02:12.660> I<00:02:12.810> mentioned<00:02:13.230> in

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
oxide treated steel bolts I mentioned in

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.420 
oxide treated steel bolts I mentioned in
the<00:02:13.350> beginning<00:02:13.440> of<00:02:13.710> the<00:02:13.800> video<00:02:13.950> that<00:02:14.220> it's<00:02:14.340> an

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
the beginning of the video that it's an

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.130 
the beginning of the video that it's an
ambidextrous<00:02:15.090> design<00:02:15.120> so<00:02:15.720> how<00:02:15.840> does<00:02:15.900> that

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
ambidextrous design so how does that

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.720 
ambidextrous design so how does that
actually<00:02:16.320> work<00:02:16.500> right<00:02:17.040> well<00:02:17.280> let's<00:02:17.460> take<00:02:17.700> a

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
actually work right well let's take a

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.010 
actually work right well let's take a
look<00:02:17.910> at<00:02:18.030> how<00:02:18.150> we<00:02:18.210> have<00:02:18.390> it<00:02:18.480> set<00:02:18.510> up<00:02:18.750> here<00:02:18.780> and

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
look at how we have it set up here and

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.970 
look at how we have it set up here and
how<00:02:19.110> we've<00:02:19.230> been<00:02:19.320> using<00:02:19.530> it<00:02:19.680> throughout<00:02:19.860> the

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
how we've been using it throughout the

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.740 
how we've been using it throughout the
video<00:02:20.190> basically<00:02:21.120> we<00:02:21.240> have<00:02:21.360> it<00:02:21.450> set<00:02:21.630> up<00:02:21.660> so

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
video basically we have it set up so

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.300 
video basically we have it set up so
that<00:02:21.900> your<00:02:22.110> emag<00:02:22.380> slots<00:02:22.650> are<00:02:22.770> gonna<00:02:22.950> go<00:02:23.070> here

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
that your emag slots are gonna go here

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.950 
that your emag slots are gonna go here
and<00:02:23.550> it<00:02:23.700> can<00:02:23.790> activate<00:02:24.180> it<00:02:24.330> with<00:02:24.480> my<00:02:24.660> thumb

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
and it can activate it with my thumb

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.840 
and it can activate it with my thumb
from<00:02:25.800> the<00:02:25.860> shooters<00:02:26.220> from<00:02:26.340> sector<00:02:26.580> and<00:02:26.760> now

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
from the shooters from sector and now

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.700 
from the shooters from sector and now
some<00:02:27.090> people<00:02:27.210> are<00:02:27.840> gonna<00:02:27.990> prefer<00:02:28.200> it<00:02:28.410> to<00:02:28.470> be<00:02:28.620> on

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
some people are gonna prefer it to be on

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.350 
some people are gonna prefer it to be on
the<00:02:28.800> other<00:02:28.860> side<00:02:28.950> so<00:02:29.340> even<00:02:29.640> with<00:02:29.760> this<00:02:29.970> setup

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
the other side so even with this setup

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.420 
the other side so even with this setup
like<00:02:30.480> it<00:02:30.630> is<00:02:30.780> if<00:02:31.350> you<00:02:31.530> wanted<00:02:31.890> to<00:02:32.040> a<00:02:32.070> lot<00:02:32.400> of

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
like it is if you wanted to a lot of

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.920 
like it is if you wanted to a lot of
people<00:02:32.730> use<00:02:32.940> vertical<00:02:33.360> grips<00:02:33.570> like<00:02:33.780> their

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
people use vertical grips like their

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.480 
people use vertical grips like their
lights<00:02:34.110> below<00:02:34.560> particularly<00:02:35.070> right-handed

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
lights below particularly right-handed

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:36.710 
lights below particularly right-handed
shooters<00:02:35.790> and<00:02:35.880> they<00:02:35.970> can<00:02:36.120> activate<00:02:36.480> it<00:02:36.600> with

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
shooters and they can activate it with

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.260 
shooters and they can activate it with
their<00:02:36.870> thumb<00:02:37.200> like<00:02:37.410> this<00:02:37.470> now<00:02:38.310> let's<00:02:39.060> say

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
their thumb like this now let's say

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.390 
their thumb like this now let's say
instead<00:02:39.750> of<00:02:39.900> having<00:02:40.320> it<00:02:40.470> up<00:02:40.560> here<00:02:40.800> that<00:02:41.370> you

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
instead of having it up here that you

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.470 
instead of having it up here that you
wanted<00:02:41.730> it<00:02:41.790> to<00:02:41.820> be<00:02:41.940> facing<00:02:42.180> in<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.420> same

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
wanted it to be facing in the same

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.300 
wanted it to be facing in the same
direction<00:02:42.660> but<00:02:43.350> over<00:02:43.560> on<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:43.770> right<00:02:43.980> side<00:02:44.010> of

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
direction but over on the right side of

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.729 
direction but over on the right side of
the<00:02:44.370> rifle<00:02:44.730> so<00:02:44.910> it's<00:02:45.060> pretty<00:02:45.330> easy<00:02:45.630> to<00:02:45.959> do<00:02:46.110> we

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
the rifle so it's pretty easy to do we

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.770 
the rifle so it's pretty easy to do we
roll<00:02:47.070> it<00:02:47.220> over<00:02:47.400> like<00:02:47.489> this<00:02:47.730> and<00:02:47.970> all<00:02:48.480> you<00:02:48.630> need

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
roll it over like this and all you need

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.120 
roll it over like this and all you need
to<00:02:48.870> do<00:02:48.989> to<00:02:49.110> actually<00:02:49.440> switch<00:02:49.620> that<00:02:49.800> out<00:02:49.980> is

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
to do to actually switch that out is

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.710 
to do to actually switch that out is
we're<00:02:50.250> gonna<00:02:50.370> take<00:02:50.610> this<00:02:50.820> nut<00:02:51.570> out<00:02:51.720> here

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
we're gonna take this nut out here

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.080 
we're gonna take this nut out here
remove<00:02:54.720> it<00:02:54.930> and<00:02:55.200> this<00:02:55.739> piece<00:02:55.980> comes<00:02:56.250> off<00:02:56.520> and

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
remove it and this piece comes off and

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.910 
remove it and this piece comes off and
you<00:02:57.209> can<00:02:57.360> see<00:02:57.600> how<00:02:57.989> it<00:02:58.110> interfaces<00:02:58.350> here<00:02:58.830> on

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
you can see how it interfaces here on

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.790 
you can see how it interfaces here on
the<00:02:58.980> back<00:02:59.160> you<00:03:00.060> can<00:03:00.120> just<00:03:00.390> swap<00:03:00.660> it<00:03:00.720> over<00:03:00.930> and

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
the back you can just swap it over and

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.080 
the back you can just swap it over and
now<00:03:01.950> at<00:03:02.070> this<00:03:02.190> point<00:03:02.400> we<00:03:02.550> can<00:03:02.670> put<00:03:02.820> our<00:03:02.910> nut

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
now at this point we can put our nut

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.670 
now at this point we can put our nut
back<00:03:03.300> through<00:03:03.540> we're<00:03:04.230> just<00:03:04.350> going<00:03:04.470> to<00:03:04.530> line<00:03:04.650> it

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
back through we're just going to line it

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.970 
back through we're just going to line it
up<00:03:04.890> there<00:03:05.100> with<00:03:05.220> that<00:03:05.340> Magpul<00:03:05.880> factory<00:03:06.270> t-nut

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
up there with that Magpul factory t-nut

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.310 
up there with that Magpul factory t-nut
get<00:03:07.980> it<00:03:08.070> started<00:03:08.370> in<00:03:08.489> the<00:03:08.550> threads<00:03:09.020> if<00:03:10.020> I<00:03:10.140> can

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
get it started in the threads if I can

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.620 
get it started in the threads if I can
actually<00:03:10.470> be<00:03:10.709> set<00:03:10.890> it's<00:03:11.730> always<00:03:12.030> hard<00:03:12.270> working

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
actually be set it's always hard working

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.010 
actually be set it's always hard working
American<00:03:13.050> and<00:03:13.430> at<00:03:14.430> that<00:03:14.670> point<00:03:15.020> basically

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
American and at that point basically

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.900 
American and at that point basically
you're<00:03:16.290> gonna<00:03:16.350> take<00:03:16.650> it<00:03:16.800> and<00:03:17.190> line<00:03:17.670> your<00:03:17.790> T

nuts up you can put it right back in
your<00:03:19.709> and<00:03:19.950> mock<00:03:20.100> slots<00:03:20.400> like<00:03:20.640> that<00:03:20.880> so<00:03:21.450> that

you can do it and really you can do that

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.790 
you can do it and really you can do that
anywhere<00:03:25.230> around<00:03:25.650> the<00:03:26.040> rail<00:03:26.220> on<00:03:26.519> either<00:03:26.910> side

installation of any of your unlock slots

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.580 
installation of any of your unlock slots
is<00:03:30.269> gonna<00:03:30.420> be<00:03:30.510> pretty<00:03:30.690> simple<00:03:30.989> you<00:03:31.230> want<00:03:31.350> it<00:03:31.500> to

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
is gonna be pretty simple you want it to

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.949 
is gonna be pretty simple you want it to
be<00:03:31.680> sort<00:03:31.950> of<00:03:32.040> loose<00:03:32.250> here<00:03:32.670> in<00:03:33.090> terms<00:03:33.660> of<00:03:33.810> where

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
be sort of loose here in terms of where

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.449 
be sort of loose here in terms of where
your<00:03:34.080> key<00:03:34.260> nut<00:03:34.440> is<00:03:34.590> but<00:03:34.860> basically<00:03:35.010> if<00:03:35.340> it's

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
your key nut is but basically if it's

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:36.860 
your key nut is but basically if it's
about<00:03:35.730> flush<00:03:36.239> that's<00:03:36.420> about<00:03:36.690> the<00:03:36.840> right

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
about flush that's about the right

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.070 
about flush that's about the right
position<00:03:37.410> for<00:03:37.890> the<00:03:38.489> front<00:03:38.760> little<00:03:39.420> bolt<00:03:39.840> and

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
position for the front little bolt and

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.120 
position for the front little bolt and
we're<00:03:40.170> gonna<00:03:40.260> put<00:03:40.470> our<00:03:40.560> light<00:03:40.709> in<00:03:40.860> there<00:03:40.980> will

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
we're gonna put our light in there will

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.500 
we're gonna put our light in there will
use<00:03:41.250> the<00:03:41.400> else<00:03:41.519> out<00:03:41.670> of<00:03:41.700> Bravo<00:03:42.000> here<00:03:42.300> for

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
use the else out of Bravo here for

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.390 
use the else out of Bravo here for
example<00:03:42.780> at<00:03:43.500> this<00:03:43.650> point<00:03:43.950> you<00:03:44.040> can<00:03:44.160> sort<00:03:44.340> of

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
example at this point you can sort of

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.430 
example at this point you can sort of
tighten<00:03:44.760> down<00:03:44.790> a<00:03:45.239> little<00:03:45.480> bit<00:03:45.660> that<00:03:46.049> way<00:03:46.230> it's

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
tighten down a little bit that way it's

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.230 
tighten down a little bit that way it's
sort

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:47.240

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.650 
sort
no<00:03:48.490> not<00:03:49.490> too<00:03:49.670> tight<00:03:49.880> though<00:03:50.090> you<00:03:50.150> still<00:03:50.450> want

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
no not too tight though you still want

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
there where I can still spin that's

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:57.460 
there where I can still spin that's
where<00:03:56.870> you<00:03:56.960> want<00:03:57.200> it

them<00:04:04.550> in<00:04:04.670> our<00:04:04.760> railed<00:04:05.090> slot<00:04:05.570> line<00:04:06.380> them<00:04:06.590> up

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
them in our railed slot line them up

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.980 
them in our railed slot line them up
wherever<00:04:07.370> you<00:04:07.610> want<00:04:07.820> there<00:04:08.120> and<00:04:08.420> at<00:04:08.870> this

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
point we're just gonna turn it until we

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.690
