00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
it off tighten it up and that's how you

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.190 
it off tighten it up and that's how you
do<00:02:12.260> the<00:02:12.860> long<00:02:13.070> tail<00:02:13.340> cast<00:02:13.370> on<00:02:14.050> it's<00:02:15.050> my

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
do the long tail cast on it's my

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.800 
do the long tail cast on it's my
favorite<00:02:15.740> method<00:02:16.100> I've<00:02:16.730> learned<00:02:17.360> that<00:02:17.570> with

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
favorite method I've learned that with

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.350 
favorite method I've learned that with
this<00:02:18.170> size<00:02:18.440> yarn<00:02:19.280> which<00:02:19.550> is<00:02:19.580> a<00:02:19.730> worsted<00:02:20.180> weight

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
this size yarn which is a worsted weight

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.740 
this size yarn which is a worsted weight
I<00:02:20.680> need<00:02:21.680> about<00:02:21.800> 12<00:02:22.460> inches<00:02:22.730> for<00:02:23.150> every<00:02:23.390> 20

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
I need about 12 inches for every 20

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.630 
I need about 12 inches for every 20
stitches<00:02:24.230> but<00:02:24.740> it<00:02:24.890> really<00:02:25.010> depends<00:02:25.430> on<00:02:25.580> the

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
stitches but it really depends on the

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.300 
stitches but it really depends on the
size<00:02:25.880> of<00:02:26.120> your<00:02:26.330> yarn<00:02:26.600> the<00:02:27.170> thickness<00:02:27.650> and<00:02:27.920> how

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
size of your yarn the thickness and how

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.650 
size of your yarn the thickness and how
many<00:02:28.460> stitches<00:02:28.670> you<00:02:28.940> need<00:02:28.970> to<00:02:29.120> cast<00:02:29.210> on<00:02:29.540> you

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
many stitches you need to cast on you

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.960 
many stitches you need to cast on you
just<00:02:29.810> don't<00:02:29.960> want<00:02:30.110> to<00:02:30.170> run<00:02:30.380> out<00:02:30.560> of<00:02:30.610> yarn<00:02:31.610> tail

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
just don't want to run out of yarn tail

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.170 
just don't want to run out of yarn tail
so<00:02:32.660> I<00:02:32.690> usually<00:02:33.050> do<00:02:33.290> mine<00:02:33.500> even<00:02:34.370> way<00:02:34.670> longer

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
so I usually do mine even way longer

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.300 
so I usually do mine even way longer
than<00:02:35.330> I<00:02:35.450> would<00:02:35.510> ever<00:02:35.750> need<00:02:36.050> and<00:02:36.920> then<00:02:37.070> just

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
than I would ever need and then just

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.550 
than I would ever need and then just
trim<00:02:37.520> it<00:02:37.670> down<00:02:37.700> when<00:02:38.540> I'm<00:02:38.720> ready<00:02:39.200> to<00:02:39.380> start

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
trim it down when I'm ready to start

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.830 
trim it down when I'm ready to start
knitting<00:02:39.880> so<00:02:40.880> I<00:02:40.910> made<00:02:41.150> this<00:02:41.270> little<00:02:41.570> swatch<00:02:41.810> to

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
knitting so I made this little swatch to

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.350 
knitting so I made this little swatch to
show<00:02:42.230> you<00:02:42.290> the<00:02:42.800> end<00:02:42.980> result<00:02:43.220> it's<00:02:43.910> a<00:02:44.180> nice

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
show you the end result it's a nice

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.470 
show you the end result it's a nice
elastic<00:02:44.750> edge<00:02:45.320> and<00:02:45.830> it's<00:02:46.280> a<00:02:46.400> smooth<00:02:46.670> edge<00:02:46.910> the

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
elastic edge and it's a smooth edge the

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.300 
elastic edge and it's a smooth edge the
reason<00:02:47.750> I<00:02:47.870> love<00:02:48.110> this<00:02:48.380> cast<00:02:48.650> on<00:02:48.830> method<00:02:48.980> is

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
reason I love this cast on method is

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.660 
reason I love this cast on method is
it's<00:02:49.580> also<00:02:49.850> your<00:02:50.330> first<00:02:50.660> knit<00:02:51.080> row<00:02:51.320> so<00:02:52.040> when

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
it's also your first knit row so when

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.360 
it's also your first knit row so when
you<00:02:52.760> make<00:02:53.000> make<00:02:53.510> this<00:02:53.840> cast<00:02:54.200> on<00:02:54.410> edge<00:02:54.800> here

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
you make make this cast on edge here

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.520 
you make make this cast on edge here
like<00:02:55.520> this<00:02:55.790> it<00:02:56.120> will<00:02:56.540> have<00:02:56.720> a<00:02:56.780> purl<00:02:57.080> bump<00:02:57.380> on

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
like this it will have a purl bump on

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.680 
like this it will have a purl bump on
the<00:02:57.650> back<00:02:57.800> so<00:02:58.400> it's<00:02:58.550> actually<00:02:59.030> your<00:02:59.180> first<00:02:59.360> row

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
the back so it's actually your first row

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.960 
the back so it's actually your first row
so<00:03:00.380> if<00:03:00.739> you're<00:03:00.980> a<00:03:01.040> beginner<00:03:01.430> knitter<00:03:01.640> you<00:03:01.790> may

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
so if you're a beginner knitter you may

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.250 
so if you're a beginner knitter you may
not<00:03:02.150> understand<00:03:02.570> what<00:03:02.690> I'm<00:03:02.810> talking<00:03:02.989> about

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
not understand what I'm talking about

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.720 
not understand what I'm talking about
but<00:03:03.590> if<00:03:03.680> you're<00:03:03.830> an<00:03:03.920> advanced<00:03:04.250> knitter<00:03:04.520> you'll

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
but if you're an advanced knitter you'll

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:05.560 
but if you're an advanced knitter you'll
know<00:03:04.910> what<00:03:05.060> I<00:03:05.090> mean

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
know what I mean

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.560 
know what I mean
so<00:03:05.720> the<00:03:06.470> longtail<00:03:06.860> cast<00:03:07.400> on<00:03:07.580> method<00:03:07.760> is<00:03:08.030> one

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
so the longtail cast on method is one

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.300 
so the longtail cast on method is one
that<00:03:08.720> I<00:03:08.750> use<00:03:08.840> for<00:03:09.260> almost<00:03:09.440> every<00:03:09.770> project<00:03:09.980> I

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
that I use for almost every project I

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.080 
that I use for almost every project I
knit<00:03:10.520> so<00:03:11.330> thanks<00:03:11.630> for<00:03:11.720> watching
