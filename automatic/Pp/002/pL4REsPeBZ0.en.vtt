00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.380
 welcome to kitchen debts today 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.240
 we will prepare some sweets that they will put 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.310
 agree just all adults and children 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:43.180
 we are talking about inter lots 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:44.860
 we fight lots of fake ingredients 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.629
 they are very inviting sweets but 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.060
 preparing them is very simple and quite 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.820
 as fast as you have seen, few are needed 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.840
 ingredients for which we will proceed 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.090
 directly inside a bowl 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.399
 where we will first work together the 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.890
 nutella which must be well into 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:01.930
 workable so it must have a right one 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.420
 consistency and neither be nor too harsh 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.040
 nor too solid so if prepared in 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.710
 the lot in the summer of just leaving 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.180
 nutella at room temperature 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.190
 otherwise warm it up in winter 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.930
 only for a few merry seconds 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.119
 but be careful that it does not become 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.740
 too fluid along with nutella 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:19.600
 we will also add a new one that must 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.280
 be at room temperature e 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.409
 we will work in everything with a fork 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.570
 after which we will add little by little 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:27.369
 the flour I always recommend 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.409
 scour so that it does not contain any 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.090
 lumps inside we'll work it all out 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:32.770
 up to form a compound that is 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.030
 perfectly homogeneous 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.030
 then we begin our preparation 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.420
 the compound of our bellotti to this 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.549
 point is ready as you saw the 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.079
 consistency and well compacted enough 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:25.049
 dense if the result you got 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:26.849
 this you can go directly to 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:29.129
 making the balls that 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.540
 will constitute those nute lots of us that 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:32.370
 we're going to lay out on a baking sheet 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.170
 lined with baking paper 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.120
 if instead the compound should result 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.220
 still too fluid also the seng 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.079
 nutella that is melted too much you can do 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.390
 rest everything in the refrigerator for 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:44.220
 about 15 20 minutes so that you 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.989
 compact us perfectly in this 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.319
 case we will proceed to the realization of the 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.319
 pilots 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.970
 our dots at this point are 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:14.650
 ready so now we just have to 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.170
 switch to filling and decoration 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.790
 of our lots to do this 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.590
 we will initially have to go and create 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.959
 of the basins in the middle of ours 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.360
 balls also simply with your finger 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:27.700
 applying a little pressure afterwards 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.959
 of which we will insert the antennas inside 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.630
 of a porsche bag with points a 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.760
 stellata and we will proceed to create the 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.739
 filled with our own, he has lots to do 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.870
 this is important the consistency of the 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:40.209
 your nutella which must not be either 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.230
 too much money nor liquid too much 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.780
 otherwise this operation 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.430
 it would be very difficult therefore if 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.010
 prepares held and wrestles winter and the 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.870
 Nutella should be too solid 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.590
 choose it for a few seconds at 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.510
 microwave 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.599
 on the contrary if it should be 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.340
 too fluid pass it for some 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:59.650
 minute in the freezer so it takes a while 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.810
 of body d is more simple then 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.180
 go create our stuffing later 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.010
 of which we will end with a handful of 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.720
 chopped hazelnuts that will recall the 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.880
 taste of ours feeds the excellent that 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.380
 will also give a touch of color to ours 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.420
 our own then they will go 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.060
 put in a preheated oven at 180 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.039
 created for approximately 8 10 minutes per 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.200
 maximum cooking of the octs is 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:22.150
 very fast so it was not prolonged 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.490
 too much because otherwise the nutella 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.500
 of the filling will dry out 3 too much 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.840
 when stopped they will be ready 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.940
 still quite soft but it will be enough 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.919
 leave them to give for certainly because 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.450
 reach the right consistency 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:37.320
 then we finish the preparation 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.320
 let's go on to cooking 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.870
 after getting perfectly cold i 

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:14.610
 Our note lots are ready to be 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:18.350
 brought our guests good paola 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.350
 appetite and the next recipe
