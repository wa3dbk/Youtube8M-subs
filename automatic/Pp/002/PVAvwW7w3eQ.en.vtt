it<00:00:24.330> begins<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.689> move<00:00:24.960> now<00:00:25.680> you<00:00:25.740> want<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.039> run

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
it begins to move now you want to run

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.400 
it begins to move now you want to run
back<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.730> train<00:00:27.390> tracks<00:00:27.599> you<00:00:28.170> don't<00:00:28.320> have

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
back to the train tracks you don't have

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.839 
back to the train tracks you don't have
to<00:00:28.500> go<00:00:28.590> too<00:00:28.650> quickly<00:00:29.070> because<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.640> train

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
to go too quickly because the train

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.759 
to go too quickly because the train
itself<00:00:30.000> is<00:00:30.300> very<00:00:30.359> slow<00:00:30.810> moving<00:00:30.840> but<00:00:31.410> you

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
itself is very slow moving but you

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.170 
itself is very slow moving but you
basically<00:00:32.099> want<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.430> stand<00:00:32.669> between<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:33.030> two

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
basically want to stand between the two

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.970 
basically want to stand between the two
pillars<00:00:33.420> in<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.989> same<00:00:34.200> location<00:00:34.710> where<00:00:34.739> I'm

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
pillars in the same location where I'm

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.400 
pillars in the same location where I'm
standing<00:00:35.270> so<00:00:36.270> once<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.630> Train<00:00:36.840> begins<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.260> get

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
standing so once the Train begins to get

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.110 
standing so once the Train begins to get
close<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.920> you<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:38.430> can<00:00:38.550> start<00:00:38.790> picking

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
close to you and you can start picking

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.880 
close to you and you can start picking
your<00:00:39.270> ballistic<00:00:39.510> vest<00:00:39.899> up<00:00:40.140> you<00:00:40.590> can<00:00:40.739> begin

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
your ballistic vest up you can begin

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.799 
your ballistic vest up you can begin
capturing<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.640> ballistic<00:00:42.090> vest<00:00:42.329> but<00:00:42.750> you

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
capturing the ballistic vest but you

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.240 
capturing the ballistic vest but you
don't<00:00:42.960> actually<00:00:43.200> want<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.620> pick<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:43.920> up<00:00:44.040> and

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
don't actually want to pick it up and

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.770 
don't actually want to pick it up and
you<00:00:44.670> want<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:44.879> keep<00:00:44.969> doing<00:00:45.270> this<00:00:45.390> over<00:00:45.539> and

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
you want to keep doing this over and

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.690 
you want to keep doing this over and
over<00:00:45.960> again<00:00:46.200> until<00:00:46.559> eventually<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.489> train

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
over again until eventually the train

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.310 
over again until eventually the train
goes<00:00:47.910> through<00:00:48.149> your<00:00:48.300> player<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.989> you'll<00:00:49.170> be

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
goes through your player and you'll be

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.990 
goes through your player and you'll be
wool<00:00:49.500> breached<00:00:49.800> inside<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.370> train<00:00:50.579> carriage

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
wool breached inside the train carriage

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.479
