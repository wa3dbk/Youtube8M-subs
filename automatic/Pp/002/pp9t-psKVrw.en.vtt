00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.430
 in the next few minutes we are going to 

00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:09.420
 describe the process known as the 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:11.350
 meiosis or cell division 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.170
 sexual 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:16.240
 well meiosis is written as we saw in 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.340
 our previous video the meiosis the 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:23.529
 we define by how the process by 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:27.180
 which a diploid cell or 12 n is capable 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:31.190
 to give rise to 4 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.190
 cells to floyd is 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:35.530
 klein 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:40.809
 on 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:42.940
 we have 1 2 3 4 cells to floyd is that 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:44.920
 when they mature they become the 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.710
 gametes 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.659
 what are the cells that later go to 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.990
 give origin to our sexual cells 

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:55.490
 the ovules 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.490
 and the sperm 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.230
 sperm 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:04.620
 these cells that have the ability to 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.340
 generate the gametes are known as 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:10.880
 germ cells 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:13.909
 and germinated are located 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.799
 located in our sexual organs 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:17.810
 then mitosis is the process by 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:21.439
 which is generated from a cell 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.829
 germinal the four gametes to floyd es 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:26.179
 now let's talk specific little 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:29.060
 specifically of mitosis for that 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:30.079
 let's erase this if we leave a bit of 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.270
 place 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:34.080
 and we talked about the myths about 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.590
 meiosis forgiveness 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:41.250
 meiosis like mitosis as 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.180
 we saw in the non-sexual cell division or 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.600
 asexual 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.840
 the meiosis is divided in turn into two 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.840
 phases 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.210
 let's put it like that 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.840
 I'm gods 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:02.220
 in meiosis we are going to say that it is 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:05.780
 divided in meiosis 1 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.780
 and meiosis 2 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:16.460
 and in turn each of the processes of 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.950
 means did 1 and 2 are in the same 4 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:25.240
 phases that we describe for mitosis 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:30.070
 that was the profa is the goal phase 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:34.300
 the one phase and the phase of the same here 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:37.180
 the four phases the profa meta phase 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.460
 one phase and I'll phase it 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.110
 then let's go describing step to 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.030
 step what is what happens in meiosis 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.370
 ones and what is happening in the 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.810
 meiosis 2 if you remember our 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.330
 last video 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.000
 when we saw that the cells were doing 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:58.080
 agree on the cell cycle in the cycle 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:01.620
 cellular had a great interface 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:05.670
 and interfaces in which the cells in the 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:09.480
 phase specifically doubled the 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:12.630
 genetic material of DNA was duplicated 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.540
 then at that moment what happens is 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:18.660
 that the chromosomes start to have their 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.970
 chromatic sisters a chromosome now 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.430
 has twice the genetic amount 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.910
 has its sister chromatin linked by 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:29.130
 assumed by the center but well what 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.560
 happens is what he says we focus 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:35.040
 for example on a pair of chromosomes the 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.100
 pair of chromosomes number 7 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.410
 as an example, nothing more 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.750
 this pair of chromosomes we know 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.150
 that this chromosome was inherited from me 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.820
 mother and this chromosome was inherited from 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.040
 my father with which these two 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:51.620
 chromosomes do not have exactly the 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:55.000
 same genetic information this pair of 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:57.640
 chromosomes are said to be chromosomes 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.380
 homologs 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.460
 or models 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:06.260
 because although they have the same 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:09.620
 information about which genes are 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.300
 contained in chromosome 7 not all the 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.670
 genetic information is going to be 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:16.040
 exactly the same if there could be a 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:20.570
 example let's suppose that on chromosome 7 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:22.790
 It was the gene for eye color the 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.730
 two sevens chromosomes are going to have that 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.950
 gen but maybe in my case 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:30.770
 paternal chromosome codes for a color 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.810
 of blue eyes and on the maternal chromosome 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:36.020
 code for green eyes color 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:38.270
 which depends on which is the 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.310
 genetic code that exists in each 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:43.010
 of these genes it is said that these 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:45.170
 chromosomes are homologous and this is 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:47.510
 important to be able to understand how it's going to 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:49.960
 occur meiosis 1 and meiosis 2 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:52.730
 let's see down here then 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.980
 specifically meiosis 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:58.160
 one 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:00.950
 or first stage of meiosis what's going 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:04.340
 to happen here this 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:09.200
 the two chromosomes are going to separate 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:11.690
 homologs that is one for one side and one 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:15.410
 for the other one I want to say with this 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:18.590
 that the mother cell that we had to take out 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:20.570
 the mother cell will produce or cell 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:25.130
 germinal we had also said that it 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:27.740
 he says he's going to produce two daughter cells of 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:31.700
 which each one will carry a 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:34.490
 chromosome to each of the cells are 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:37.420
 these cells equal daughters 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:42.130
 genetically 

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:44.440
 they are not because they are not fair 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:46.120
 because each chromosome takes us 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.940
 exactly the same information 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.740
 genetics one carries the chromosome of 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:52.870
 maternal origin and the other is leading 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:56.050
 the chromosome of paternal origin and that goes 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:58.900
 to occur for each of the 23 pairs 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:02.760
 of chromosomes so this cell is going to 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:06.150
 have 23 chromosomes 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:08.550
 and this other cell is going to have another 23 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:11.590
 chromosomes it is said that these cells are 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:14.620
 a floyd is 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:16.270
 well but equally each one follows 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.770
 having double the information 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:21.190
 genetic because we said that the 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:22.930
 chromosomes would normally have only one 

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:25.690
 chromatic this of having both 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:27.790
 chromatic is when you duplicate what 

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:31.000
 which is still missing one more division 

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:32.080
 and that second division is precisely the 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.680
 meiosis 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.680
 two 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:40.600
 then where the meiosis 2 each of 

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:44.880
 these cells are again divided for 

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:44.880
 form two new daughter cells 

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:51.160
 and now yes each of these chroma calls 

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:54.310
 it's going to separate as we saw it 

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:56.560
 exactly as in mitosis for 

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:58.270
 give place to draw this or to 

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:00.590
 give them let's draw one of the 

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:03.160
 chromatic 

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:06.310
 in green 

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:08.360
 to be able to show that in one case we're going 

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:12.020
 to have 

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:15.020
 this and in the other case the other cell what 

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:18.400
 that is going to take is the yellow with 

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:21.760
 which the final result of meiosis is 

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:24.840
 four cells 

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:24.840
 a floyd is 

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:36.180
 with we said amount of DNA even if 

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:39.150
 is the number of or type of chromosomes 

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:42.630
 each one of these cells when maturing goes 

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:44.520
 to generate we said the gametes that then 

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:47.310
 will become our ovules and 

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:50.490
 sperm and this is basically the 

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:53.780
 basis of meiosis or the division of 

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:53.780
 our sexual cells
