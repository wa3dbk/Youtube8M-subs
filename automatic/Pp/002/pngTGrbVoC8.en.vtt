okay<00:00:01.770> this<00:00:01.979> video<00:00:02.280> I'm<00:00:02.429> going<00:00:02.550> to<00:00:02.610> be

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
okay this video I'm going to be

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.120 
okay this video I'm going to be
connecting<00:00:03.480> the<00:00:04.609> EVGA<00:00:06.049> SR<00:00:07.049> to<00:00:07.290> 1200<00:00:08.040> watt

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
connecting the EVGA SR to 1200 watt

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.450 
connecting the EVGA SR to 1200 watt
power<00:00:08.370> supply<00:00:08.460> to<00:00:09.139> the<00:00:10.139> EVGA<00:00:10.559> classified<00:00:10.830> sr-2

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
power supply to the EVGA classified sr-2

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.499 
power supply to the EVGA classified sr-2
motherboard<00:00:12.230> so<00:00:13.230> let's<00:00:13.380> first<00:00:13.620> begin<00:00:13.769> by

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:14.509 
motherboard so let's first begin by

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:16.910 
motherboard so let's first begin by
unraveling<00:00:15.509> this<00:00:15.630> ridiculous<00:00:16.199> amount<00:00:16.800> of

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
unraveling this ridiculous amount of

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:30.859 
unraveling this ridiculous amount of
cabling

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.900 

well<00:00:31.869> relatively<00:00:32.800> free<00:00:34.980> doing<00:00:35.980> I'm<00:00:36.670> going<00:00:36.820> to

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
well relatively free doing I'm going to

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.619 
well relatively free doing I'm going to
put<00:00:37.090> them<00:00:37.270> all<00:00:37.710> outside<00:00:38.710> and<00:00:39.340> only<00:00:40.120> putting<00:00:40.390> in

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:40.629 
put them all outside and only putting in

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:44.579 
put them all outside and only putting in
one<00:00:41.559> cable<00:00:41.890> at<00:00:42.129> a<00:00:42.160> time<00:00:42.430> as<00:00:42.699> I<00:00:43.180> need<00:00:43.360> them<00:00:43.589> so

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:44.589 
one cable at a time as I need them so

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:47.070 
one cable at a time as I need them so
first<00:00:44.949> and<00:00:45.129> foremost<00:00:45.220> is<00:00:45.879> the<00:00:45.940> power<00:00:46.870> supply

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:47.080 
first and foremost is the power supply

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:55.890 
first and foremost is the power supply
to<00:00:47.650> the<00:00:48.519> big<00:00:48.760> mother<00:00:49.720> board<00:00:50.019> and<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:55.360> question

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:55.900 
to the big mother board and the question

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.520 
to the big mother board and the question
is<00:00:56.079> which<00:00:56.890> pin<00:00:57.339> goes<00:00:57.940> where<00:00:58.530> and

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
is which pin goes where and

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.799 
is which pin goes where and
interestingly<00:00:59.739> enough<00:01:00.340> you<00:01:00.670> can<00:01:01.120> only<00:01:01.270> put<00:01:01.629> in

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809 
interestingly enough you can only put in

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:10.680 
interestingly enough you can only put in
this<00:01:02.710> thing<00:01:02.770> one<00:01:03.280> way<00:01:03.839> so<00:01:04.839> that<00:01:08.940> is<00:01:09.940> the<00:01:10.509> one

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
this thing one way so that is the one

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:17.340 
this thing one way so that is the one
way<00:01:10.899> that<00:01:11.530> you<00:01:11.590> can<00:01:11.680> put<00:01:12.039> it<00:01:12.130> in<00:01:14.850> ok<00:01:15.850> so<00:01:16.780> this<00:01:17.050> is

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
way that you can put it in ok so this is

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:24.510 
way that you can put it in ok so this is
the<00:01:20.940> power<00:01:21.940> that<00:01:22.440> goes<00:01:23.440> to<00:01:23.830> the<00:01:23.860> flow<00:01:24.280> by<00:01:24.460> the

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
the power that goes to the flow by the

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.190 
the power that goes to the flow by the
board<00:01:26.250> now<00:01:27.250> the<00:01:28.060> other<00:01:28.090> thing<00:01:28.390> I<00:01:28.660> have<00:01:28.840> to<00:01:28.869> do

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
board now the other thing I have to do

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:37.169 
board now the other thing I have to do
is<00:01:29.970> connect<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.890> cpu<00:01:34.110> power<00:01:35.550> and<00:01:36.550> this

00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:37.179 
is connect the cpu power and this

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:41.540 
is connect the cpu power and this
particular<00:01:37.390> cable<00:01:38.170> is<00:01:38.709> actually<00:01:39.190> labeled<00:01:39.959> cpu

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.550 
particular cable is actually labeled cpu

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.570 
particular cable is actually labeled cpu
so<00:01:42.550> thumb<00:01:43.030> i'm<00:01:43.810> going<00:01:44.110> to<00:01:44.170> be<00:01:44.489> connecting<00:01:45.489> a

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
so thumb i'm going to be connecting a

00:01:45.580 --> 00:02:00.090 
so thumb i'm going to be connecting a
directly<00:01:45.940> to<00:01:46.239> the<00:01:46.360> primary<00:01:46.869> cpu

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.870 

go<00:02:01.100> and<00:02:01.969> the<00:02:02.299> kinder<00:02:02.630> seekers<00:02:03.020> will<00:02:03.170> be<00:02:03.229> here

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
go and the kinder seekers will be here

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:10.330 
go and the kinder seekers will be here
so<00:02:05.799> pans<00:02:06.799> are<00:02:07.189> right<00:02:07.369> here<00:02:07.989> for<00:02:08.989> the<00:02:09.080> power<00:02:09.340> so

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
so pans are right here for the power so

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.320 
so pans are right here for the power so
let<00:02:10.610> me<00:02:10.640> connect<00:02:11.090> the<00:02:11.360> first<00:02:11.810> one<00:02:12.049> first<00:02:13.330> it

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
let me connect the first one first it

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:24.630 
let me connect the first one first it
goes<00:02:14.510> in<00:02:14.750> or<00:02:14.959> so<00:02:18.790> yep<00:02:19.870> and<00:02:20.870> this<00:02:21.260> is<00:02:21.500> the<00:02:23.290> second

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
goes in or so yep and this is the second

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:32.080 
goes in or so yep and this is the second
power<00:02:25.640> connector<00:02:28.030> for<00:02:29.030> the<00:02:29.390> primary<00:02:29.750> cpu<00:02:31.090> and

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
power connector for the primary cpu and

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.699 
power connector for the primary cpu and
it<00:02:32.209> goes<00:02:32.329> in<00:02:32.540> like<00:02:32.690> so<00:02:32.989> and<00:02:34.690> that's<00:02:35.690> it<00:02:35.959> as<00:02:36.680> far

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
it goes in like so and that's it as far

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.360 
it goes in like so and that's it as far
as<00:02:37.129> the<00:02:37.280> primary<00:02:37.579> cpu<00:02:38.299> now<00:02:39.140> i<00:02:39.470> need<00:02:39.620> to<00:02:39.890> connect

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
as the primary cpu now i need to connect

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:48.460 
as the primary cpu now i need to connect
the<00:02:40.430> power<00:02:41.079> to<00:02:42.079> the<00:02:42.440> second<00:02:42.890> cpu<00:02:44.049> and<00:02:47.260> this<00:02:48.260> is

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
the power to the second cpu and this is

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.460 
the power to the second cpu and this is
the<00:02:48.560> cable<00:02:48.799> toward<00:02:49.760> the<00:02:49.849> second<00:02:50.239> one<00:02:50.390> and<00:02:51.319> the

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
the cable toward the second one and the

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.380 
the cable toward the second one and the
second<00:02:51.829> cpu<00:02:52.190> is<00:02:52.280> right<00:02:52.430> over<00:02:52.519> here<00:02:52.879> so<00:02:53.299> i'm

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
second cpu is right over here so i'm

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.009 
second cpu is right over here so i'm
going<00:02:53.569> to<00:02:53.629> put<00:02:53.690> the<00:02:53.959> power<00:02:54.280> right<00:02:55.840> next<00:02:56.840> to<00:02:56.989> it

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
going to put the power right next to it

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:01.390 
going to put the power right next to it
Oh<00:02:57.349> actually<00:02:57.769> I<00:02:58.190> made<00:02:59.060> a<00:02:59.090> mistake<00:02:59.920> this<00:03:00.920> is<00:03:01.220> the

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
Oh actually I made a mistake this is the

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.479 
Oh actually I made a mistake this is the
primary<00:03:01.670> this<00:03:02.269> one<00:03:02.480> is<00:03:02.569> the<00:03:02.690> secondary<00:03:03.109> so<00:03:03.920> let

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
primary this one is the secondary so let

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:10.170 
primary this one is the secondary so let
me<00:03:04.700> move<00:03:04.970> that<00:03:05.239> over

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:16.860 

disconnect<00:03:12.280> this<00:03:13.569> okay<00:03:14.620> now<00:03:15.620> let<00:03:15.830> me<00:03:15.860> take

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
disconnect this okay now let me take

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:24.010 
disconnect this okay now let me take
this<00:03:17.870> one<00:03:18.140> here<00:03:19.150> and<00:03:20.150> plug<00:03:20.510> it<00:03:20.630> in<00:03:22.390> and<00:03:23.390> then

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020 
this one here and plug it in and then

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:30.420 
this one here and plug it in and then
it's<00:03:24.950> over<00:03:25.250> here<00:03:26.020> goes<00:03:27.020> in<00:03:27.290> like<00:03:27.440> so<00:03:28.330> perfect

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
it's over here goes in like so perfect

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
it's over here goes in like so perfect
okay<00:03:31.430> now<00:03:33.010> secondary<00:03:34.010> has<00:03:34.280> three<00:03:34.970> connectors

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
okay now secondary has three connectors

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.150 
okay now secondary has three connectors
it<00:03:35.810> has<00:03:35.959> the<00:03:35.989> main<00:03:36.260> one<00:03:36.470> for<00:03:36.650> the<00:03:36.709> motherboard

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
it has the main one for the motherboard

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.520 
it has the main one for the motherboard
the<00:03:37.910> auxiliary<00:03:38.360> for<00:03:38.570> the<00:03:38.660> overclocking<00:03:39.110> and

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530

like so have the auxiliary that goes in

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:16.289 
like so have the auxiliary that goes in
so

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.650 

perfect

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
perfect

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.300 
perfect
okay<00:04:19.620> now<00:04:20.600> the<00:04:21.600> only<00:04:21.780> other<00:04:22.070> there<00:04:23.070> any<00:04:23.190> other

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
okay now the only other there any other

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.080 
okay now the only other there any other
power<00:04:23.700> than<00:04:24.270> missing<00:04:24.810> I<00:04:25.670> think<00:04:26.670> that's<00:04:26.850> about

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
power than missing I think that's about

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:35.420 
power than missing I think that's about
it<00:04:32.780> check<00:04:33.780> to<00:04:33.930> make<00:04:34.050> sure<00:04:34.110> it<00:04:34.380> and<00:04:34.710> for<00:04:34.920> done<00:04:35.100> or

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
it check to make sure it and for done or

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.080 
it check to make sure it and for done or
miss<00:04:35.640> anything<00:04:36.320> but<00:04:37.320> I<00:04:37.350> think<00:04:37.470> that's<00:04:38.100> all<00:04:38.340> we

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
miss anything but I think that's all we

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.190 
miss anything but I think that's all we
have<00:04:39.300> to<00:04:39.510> do<00:04:39.710> to<00:04:40.710> connect<00:04:41.070> the<00:04:41.190> motherboard

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:42.200 
have to do to connect the motherboard

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.280 
have to do to connect the motherboard
yep<00:04:43.200> that's<00:04:43.890> it<00:04:44.100> there's<00:04:44.400> no<00:04:44.550> more<00:04:44.790> connectors

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.290 
yep that's it there's no more connectors

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.990 
yep that's it there's no more connectors
so<00:04:46.290> this<00:04:46.500> concludes<00:04:46.680> the<00:04:47.550> video<00:04:47.700> of

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
so this concludes the video of

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.400 
so this concludes the video of
connecting<00:04:48.480> the<00:04:48.630> power<00:04:48.810> supply<00:04:49.020> to<00:04:49.170> the

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
connecting the power supply to the

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.820 
connecting the power supply to the
motherboard<00:04:49.650> stay<00:04:50.550> tuned<00:04:50.790> for<00:04:51.030> another<00:04:51.120> video

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
motherboard stay tuned for another video

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.310 
motherboard stay tuned for another video
shortly<00:04:52.830> coming<00:04:53.130> up
