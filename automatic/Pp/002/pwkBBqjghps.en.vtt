00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:14.889
 I'll show you for sure how 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:17.800
 we can join the two stumps and two to 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:20.590
 taxed in an objective way. 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:23.109
 Dad, I'm here on two stumps with 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.810
 bags and clothing are here 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:28.779
 united blue and with this posture we 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.640
 we recreate a queue Mayan point and therefore 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.739
 it is a seam but it completely 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.449
 imperceptible when done with a 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.610
 work color line 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:39.010
 now how am I ever going to be from here? 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:42.610
 knot with and making this seam let's 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:46.540
 this I have here two small 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:49.869
 samples in the morning and withdrawal of 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:52.299
 needles and cocaine there from the waste one 

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:55.600
 side a contrasting color leaving all 

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:59.530
 as bad live and now I will turn the 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:02.619
 Upside down and what I want 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:06.310
 is to join these two rows of meshes in 

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:07.900
 I live by making a culture that stays 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.810
 completely imperceptible 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.149
 and to do this I must use the 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.219
 same of the light work in this house and 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:17.950
 For purposes of this video I will use 

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:20.590
 a wool other color only to achieve 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.560
 well aware of where the 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:27.039
 our needle and the first thing that 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.960
 We have to do it so I'll unroll. 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:32.350
 here the top of the tricolor precisely 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.119
 understand that side and I have to 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.460
 be very careful when you entered my 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:38.770
 not twist needle-shaped meshes or 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:42.009
 be the correct way to catch this 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:45.609
 mail and will be so for where the leg 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:49.090
 right side of the mesh front line 

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:51.789
 is on the right side and the back leg of the 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.109
 majority is on my left side and this is 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:55.299
 The yellow line is like ours. 

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:57.009
 this correct position works in the 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:59.049
 water when you introduce my 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:02.259
 spoon to make this seam has to 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:04.060
 take the work out so that no will not 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.759
 stay there going to be in the loop possible 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.470
 introduce my needle that much 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:11.110
 the front leg of the mesh has to be 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.420
 always to the right side exactly 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.760
 how the mesh should be placed in the 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.790
 needle let's imagine that ours is there 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.180
 It's an eagle and the first thing I do 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.469
 for 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.590
 on a sale this is my first 

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:28.239
 medal and I'll get back on track. 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:31.750
 where my chain comes from there and now I go 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:33.569
 get my other sample and I'll 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.760
 also pick up the first mesh here 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:39.670
 having exactly the same care taking the 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.900
 careful to check that the mesh does not 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:45.459
 stay the crowd 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:47.700
 Let's see, I'll hold here in two 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.700
 samples 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:55.299
 when it 's over 

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:58.329
 in this case for the mesh to be right 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:59.319
 we're seeing this in the head 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:02.590
 down 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:04.629
 we have to have the front leg has 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:08.109
 to be here on my right side and 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:10.689
 leave behind the left side so do not 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:14.139
 can stand here jump to the mesh side 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:19.389
 and here below will come right on the 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:21.370
 Same knit ready made up now I'm with 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:24.400
 needle down here jump to the knit 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:27.190
 of olavo and he the needle comes out again 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:33.209
 exactly in the same mesh for one dollar 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:37.599
 if I'm going to be here to opt too much 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:40.930
 Sewing we announced adjusting 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:43.959
 hours all this knit jumping to the knit 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:51.340
 the side taking care always to catch 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:54.970
 the mesh director stop with the leg and 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:58.720
 underneath the spoon leaves in exactly the same 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:00.759
 where alan went up and rule after 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.699
 this lending and the leap into the 

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:11.349
 side and the needle comes out exactly the same 

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:12.340
 where we picked up here on the side and here 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:15.549
 down 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:19.840
 the needle is in exactly the same place 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:22.360
 where it climbed will not tighten very based 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:25.500
 by when we do this seam in the 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:28.599
 reality we are simulating a queue 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:31.960
 knit to serve Christ my side 

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:32.560
 right can perceive that it forms 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.889
 on here 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:39.570
 a new row from the major point of this 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:43.930
 neighbors then if we choose too much 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:46.060
 this one gets lost and will not get a 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:49.600
 sewing was highly invasive 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:53.200
 we just need to adjust trying on 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:55.980
 fund keeping the same attention of our 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.980
 our work 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.639
 fantastic this technique is that when 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:05.790
 reach the end and remove the wires 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:08.530
 help us stay with the niel 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:10.870
 imperceptible and two other pieces or 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:12.669
 be achieved for example to join the 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.680
 shoulders of a sweater in a way 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:16.630
 completely imperceptible sankhya 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.450
 stitching at 40 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:21.100
 and you already knew this technique containing 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:23.110
 All the reviews that I return to 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:26.760
 next week with another adventure that 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.760
 We knit there until then.
