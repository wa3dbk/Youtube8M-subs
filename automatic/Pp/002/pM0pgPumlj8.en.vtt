00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:20.030
 Today is Morita 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:26.090
 We received a lot of comments to this is hey yeah Takahiro Mori School 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:28.130
 It's Mom-Saka, so I didn't think it would get you so fast, so everyone is very conscious 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.690
 I felt that it was 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:34.790
 It's a medicine 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:35.870
 I thought to answer first with sentences, but it is still in the video 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.820
 What 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:42.610
 It's in the middle of talking 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:47.100
 I thought I wanted to tell everyone, so 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.100
 I will deliver it here because it is a video 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.210
 That's right 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:56.240
 I would like to answer from the message since 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:07.490
 There was not to use the swell in water in the broadcasting 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:15.880
 Then I lost track of where to use sales 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:21.390
 There was a question that you hope you can tell us at the point 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:27.090
 It is a good seller of the butterfly but 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:33.240
 That would still use too much body when went thought the image if Re Baccarat 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:41.409
 However, there are many, but it is said that in the case of that Bataan, it can not be undone 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:47.979
 That I mean going to make a on where in the body where to use the waist rather than divided 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:51.159
 It becomes important Kedomo I'm such from it in the first bad form 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:58.539
 It is a teller to say 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:02:01.400
 It is not good to push up before it is extended after entering 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:05.480
 Then the hand came in immediately 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:09.710
 If you push up the waist 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:12.700
 Though the teaching goes up, my body falls too much 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:16.550
 Tokinie kicking mouth off to the next large 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:20.340
 Because time will change as you come up 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:27.330
 There are more eating movements 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:33.530
 From entering into the still water without 's move up and down because never stand as the body sees it water large 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:35.180
 The longer the distance to go up, the more you move up and down in the line there 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:42.260
 Ummm 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:51.490
 Because it gets bigger and it's all hit by water on the body and it becomes resistance, so your hands are 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:56.680
 Waist from extending masu day of the first one body contains the hands of that correct form rather than a little entered 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:03:01.239
 When I raise it, my weight comes in front and 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:05.480
 While I was able to stretch my body forward in Asai form 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:09.080
 In the swimming that check enters the stand 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:15.440
 It is a direction proceeding before cormorant Uma rather than a vertical movement 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:20.470
 Because my body stretches out, the meeting there 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.470
 Please be careful about the swell of the butterfly 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.110
 Are there many people who answered 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:33.100
 Well this time 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:38.760
 Thank you in this way and from now on Your questions are like this 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:40.980
 I will answer everyone in the form, so it's not a shame 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:45.500
 Lot 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:51.710
 Much less will Ide us towards the Takahiro Mori School 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:53.860
 Because I think you find it eliminates the doubt even a little web wrap such as the sky of everyone 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:57.040
 Yeah it is because of 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:59.530
 We will deliver a lot here and 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:03.640
 All do not know it 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:08.990
 Without hesitation because we will answer in the future 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:11.680
 I think that I would like to ask questions about the hotel in Moritaka 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.680
 Thank you very much
