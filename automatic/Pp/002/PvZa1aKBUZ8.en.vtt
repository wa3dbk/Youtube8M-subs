00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.770
 hello here and decided to make a review 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.950
 of tools 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:10.620
 stealth 14 105 manufacturer gives 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.269
 lifetime warranty with asterisk as 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:18.420
 always the price suited me 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:22.310
 old ratchets were broken today you 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.310
 a little pick frame 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:34.980
 ticks to use on 17 notches 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:38.090
 Gadget no they will not live to live 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:43.399
 heads a key and accordingly too 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.399
 no chipping on them 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.710
 true most likely is the name 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.829
 chrome and vanadium they are some kind 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:56.059
 rawhide metal is the only thing 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:01:03.860
 I did not like this adapter with 1 4 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:06.780
 for these tips here torso 40 begins 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.030
 if for example this bargain is 40 of which we are 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:13.920
 somehow unscrew let's say the effort here 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.580
 there will be a small top plug from the bridge 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.670
 gazelles 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:28.009
 I think it will be hard to unscrew 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:28.009
 psychologically quite pretty give 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:38.350
 fine all the same did not try 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:40.990
 I'll try to say this tool in principle 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.670
 made all kinds of adapters 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:49.200
 nozzles need all this 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:55.329
 stories with a brush today unscrew 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:58.799
 everything worked fine on this in 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:02:02.670
 In principle , let's all say so pretty 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:06.789
 budget and high-quality tool 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:09.780
 I can not recommend but to those who are looking for and 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:15.730
 who has enough money for this tool 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:18.040
 basically can u buy for the garage i 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:22.060
 I think it will be quite enough not for 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:25.420
 auto service course for garage buds up 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.879
 ships i will have a chinese set 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.910
 Frank Chinese set I have it 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:34.359
 lived for five years with this here all 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.880
 I bent the keys in the first year and roughly 

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:39.810
 telling them to throw their heads off they live 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:45.060
 Chinese are still alive but they are already 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:48.669
 lick the nuts when not afraid of bolts 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:52.329
 so I decided to buy mom and ratchet 

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:54.959
 you and the words are pretty Chinese well up 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:59.380
 I like that for three years 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:03.239
 Already torn bolts unscrew and here I am 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:06.120
 let's say already insolent and started it 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:09.340
 unscrew not torn off and the bolts of Islam you 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:12.190
 after that i bought some kind of incomprehensible 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:17.319
 rattles and broke on the first day but also 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:21.359
 changed the warranty bought this one to me 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:28.410
 quite arranged the price he had two 500 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:32.160
 at a discount so 2 900 so buy 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.160
 use repair
