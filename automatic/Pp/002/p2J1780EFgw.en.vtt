one<00:00:17.330> leaked<00:00:17.540> way<00:00:17.690> of<00:00:17.900> storing<00:00:18.230> the<00:00:18.470> wood<00:00:18.650> while

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.010 
one leaked way of storing the wood while

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.860 
one leaked way of storing the wood while
it's<00:00:19.160> seasoning<00:00:19.670> is<00:00:20.000> to<00:00:20.150> put<00:00:20.270> it<00:00:20.390> into<00:00:20.510> a<00:00:20.660> rack

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:20.870 
it's seasoning is to put it into a rack

like<00:00:20.900> this<00:00:21.760> the<00:00:22.760> lengths<00:00:23.090> have<00:00:23.210> been<00:00:23.390> cuts<00:00:23.660> to

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
like this the lengths have been cuts to

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.840 
like this the lengths have been cuts to
whatever<00:00:24.080> size<00:00:24.440> is<00:00:24.650> easy<00:00:24.830> to<00:00:25.040> handle<00:00:25.430> and

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:25.850 
whatever size is easy to handle and

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.640 
whatever size is easy to handle and
they've<00:00:26.420> also<00:00:26.570> been<00:00:26.779> split<00:00:27.200> where<00:00:27.440> they're

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
they've also been split where they're

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.240 
they've also been split where they're
larger<00:00:28.100> or<00:00:28.250> stripes<00:00:28.730> if<00:00:29.029> they're<00:00:29.270> smaller

larger or stripes if they're smaller

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.190 
larger or stripes if they're smaller
this<00:00:31.250> allows<00:00:31.490> the<00:00:31.670> woods<00:00:31.880> to<00:00:32.090> dry<00:00:32.300> out<00:00:32.480> and<00:00:32.840> you

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 
this allows the woods to dry out and you

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.930 
this allows the woods to dry out and you
haven't<00:00:33.440> moved<00:00:33.739> it<00:00:34.040> very<00:00:34.280> far<00:00:34.550> from<00:00:34.760> where

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
haven't moved it very far from where

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.000 
haven't moved it very far from where
you've<00:00:35.090> held<00:00:35.360> it<00:00:35.570> so<00:00:36.080> you've<00:00:36.260> minimized<00:00:36.620> the

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
you've held it so you've minimized the

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.000 
you've held it so you've minimized the
number<00:00:37.040> of<00:00:37.340> times<00:00:37.610> you're<00:00:37.820> handling<00:00:38.150> the<00:00:38.360> wood

the length you need same if you're using
at<00:01:03.680> home<00:01:03.739> maybe<00:01:04.369> you<00:01:04.489> try<00:01:04.970> one<00:01:05.210> length<00:01:05.449> one

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
at home maybe you try one length one

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:06.910 
at home maybe you try one length one
year<00:01:05.930> and<00:01:06.110> find<00:01:06.290> that<00:01:06.350> it<00:01:06.470> wasn't<00:01:06.770> so

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
year and find that it wasn't so

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.859 
year and find that it wasn't so
convenient<00:01:07.280> and<00:01:07.610> next<00:01:08.149> year<00:01:08.300> you<00:01:08.450> can<00:01:08.600> just<00:01:08.690> go

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
convenient and next year you can just go

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.010 
convenient and next year you can just go
back<00:01:09.050> and<00:01:09.110> cut<00:01:09.350> a<00:01:09.380> different<00:01:09.740> length<00:01:10.899> you<00:01:11.899> can

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
back and cut a different length you can

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.480 
back and cut a different length you can
leave<00:01:12.200> it<00:01:12.350> in<00:01:12.440> this<00:01:12.590> rack<00:01:12.800> for<00:01:13.040> as<00:01:13.130> long<00:01:13.250> as<00:01:13.399> you

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.440 
take lengths offers a neat way of
splitting<00:01:57.439> logs<00:01:57.799> is<00:01:58.130> to<00:01:58.369> stand<00:01:58.640> astride<00:01:58.970> them

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
splitting logs is to stand astride them

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.749 
splitting logs is to stand astride them
with<00:02:00.409> steel<00:02:00.680> Turcotte<00:02:01.130> boots<00:02:01.369> on<00:02:01.579> of<00:02:01.729> course

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
with steel Turcotte boots on of course

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.859 
with steel Turcotte boots on of course
and<00:02:02.240> swing<00:02:03.110> them<00:02:03.710> all<00:02:03.950> out<00:02:04.310> of<00:02:04.549> the<00:02:04.640> log<00:02:04.880> this

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
and swing them all out of the log this

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:07.929 
and swing them all out of the log this
way<00:02:06.049> you<00:02:06.110> can<00:02:06.350> often<00:02:06.680> send<00:02:06.920> a<00:02:07.009> split<00:02:07.310> two<00:02:07.610> three

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:07.939 
way you can often send a split two three

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:11.050 
way you can often send a split two three
feet<00:02:08.179> into<00:02:08.420> the<00:02:08.630> log<00:02:09.610> to<00:02:10.610> get<00:02:10.790> through<00:02:10.970> the

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
feet into the log to get through the

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.090 
feet into the log to get through the
rest<00:02:11.239> of<00:02:11.360> it<00:02:11.510> you<00:02:11.690> can<00:02:12.019> put<00:02:12.260> in<00:02:12.380> steel<00:02:12.860> wedges

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
rest of it you can put in steel wedges

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.759 
rest of it you can put in steel wedges
and<00:02:13.640> use<00:02:14.420> a<00:02:14.450> sledge<00:02:14.750> hammer<00:02:14.780> to<00:02:15.200> drive<00:02:15.290> them<00:02:15.650> in

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
and use a sledge hammer to drive them in

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:17.979 
and use a sledge hammer to drive them in
this<00:02:16.489> way<00:02:16.700> you<00:02:16.760> can<00:02:17.030> split<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:17.540> log<00:02:17.720> while

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
this way you can split the log while

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.199 
this way you can split the log while
it's<00:02:18.140> in<00:02:18.260> it<00:02:18.380> in<00:02:18.680> a<00:02:18.799> six<00:02:19.130> foot<00:02:19.370> eight<00:02:19.640> foot<00:02:19.970> 10

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
it's in it in a six foot eight foot 10

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.270 
it's in it in a six foot eight foot 10
foot<00:02:20.390> length<00:02:20.690> and<00:02:21.049> then<00:02:21.620> add<00:02:21.799> that<00:02:22.010> to<00:02:22.070> your

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
foot length and then add that to your

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.390 
foot length and then add that to your
stack

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
stack

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.729 
stack
it's<00:02:24.970> often<00:02:25.330> quicker<00:02:25.599> to<00:02:25.840> actually<00:02:26.290> split<00:02:26.590> the

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
it's often quicker to actually split the

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:28.680 
it's often quicker to actually split the
wood<00:02:26.860> at<00:02:27.040> this<00:02:27.220> length<00:02:27.610> rather<00:02:28.180> than<00:02:28.450> cross

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
wood at this length rather than cross

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.539 
wood at this length rather than cross
cutting<00:02:28.959> it<00:02:29.200> into<00:02:29.409> small<00:02:29.500> lengths<00:02:30.040> first<00:02:30.310> and

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
cutting it into small lengths first and

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:31.780 
cutting it into small lengths first and
then<00:02:30.670> splitting<00:02:31.000> it

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
then splitting it

00:02:31.790 --> 00:03:00.120 
then splitting it
