think<00:00:43.110> about<00:00:43.320> lifting<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:43.829> rock<00:00:44.040> on<00:00:44.280> screen<00:00:44.789> and

think about lifting a rock on screen and
sure<00:00:45.480> enough<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:46.350> rock<00:00:46.559> moves<00:00:47.239> instead<00:00:48.239> of

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
sure enough the rock moves instead of

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.910 
sure enough the rock moves instead of
pressing<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:48.930> know<00:00:49.020> holding<00:00:49.379> down<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.710> key

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
pressing you know holding down the key

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.100 
pressing you know holding down the key
we<00:00:50.370> just<00:00:50.579> think<00:00:50.850> okay<00:00:51.360> I'm<00:00:51.480> gonna<00:00:51.660> lift<00:00:51.899> this

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
we just think okay I'm gonna lift this

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.740 
we just think okay I'm gonna lift this
rock<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:53.039> off<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.370> goes

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
rock and off it goes

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.750 
rock and off it goes
now<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:55.050> epic<00:00:55.379> is<00:00:55.590> not<00:00:55.890> reading<00:00:56.399> your<00:00:56.550> mind

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
now the epic is not reading your mind

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.479 
now the epic is not reading your mind
exactly<00:00:57.690> it's<00:00:58.020> looking<00:00:58.680> for<00:00:58.859> electrical

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
exactly it's looking for electrical

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.119 
exactly it's looking for electrical
patterns<00:01:00.149> when<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:00.780> show<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.260> what<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.739> is<00:01:01.890> you

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
patterns when you show it what it is you

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.939 
patterns when you show it what it is you
think<00:01:02.160> when<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.850> say<00:01:03.090> smile<00:01:03.680> every<00:01:04.680> time

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
think when you say smile every time

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.830 
think when you say smile every time
after<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.549> it<00:01:05.850> will<00:01:06.060> know<00:01:06.299> that<00:01:06.330> you're

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
after that it will know that you're

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:07.750 
after that it will know that you're
smiling

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
smiling

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.210 
smiling
imagine<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.850> cube<00:01:09.180> fading<00:01:10.140> away<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.890> epic

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
imagine a cube fading away the epic

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.060 
imagine a cube fading away the epic
reads<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:12.030> pattern<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.750> each<00:01:13.409> time<00:01:13.860> the

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
reads the pattern and each time the

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.609 
reads the pattern and each time the
electrical<00:01:14.549> patterns<00:01:14.760> match<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.990> computer

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
electrical patterns match the computer

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.190 
electrical patterns match the computer
will<00:01:16.920> remove<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.610> cue<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.299> so<00:01:18.780> what<00:01:18.900> happens

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
will remove the cue and so what happens

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.749 
will remove the cue and so what happens
is<00:01:19.350> we<00:01:19.470> just<00:01:19.500> pick<00:01:19.950> up<00:01:20.070> their<00:01:20.250> signals<00:01:20.580> from

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
is we just pick up their signals from

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.580 
is we just pick up their signals from
the<00:01:20.880> scalp<00:01:21.119> that's<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.840> surface<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.409> head

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
the scalp that's the surface of the head

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.160 
the scalp that's the surface of the head
so<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:23.250> could<00:01:23.729> be<00:01:23.850> thinking<00:01:24.060> about<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.780> flower

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
so you could be thinking about a flower

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.130 
so you could be thinking about a flower
or<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.799> moon<00:01:26.400> or<00:01:26.880> your<00:01:27.090> girlfriend<00:01:27.720> but<00:01:27.930> as

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
or the moon or your girlfriend but as

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.980 
or the moon or your girlfriend but as
long<00:01:28.799> as<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:29.189> associated<00:01:29.970> that<00:01:30.240> thought<00:01:30.630> with

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
long as you associated that thought with

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.469 
long as you associated that thought with
an<00:01:31.140> action<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:32.100> computer<00:01:32.610> would<00:01:32.790> perform<00:01:33.299> the

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
an action the computer would perform the

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.530 
an action the computer would perform the
tasks<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:33.930> set<00:01:34.320> so<00:01:35.009> it's<00:01:35.400> not<00:01:35.610> mind-reading

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540

advantage of the epic technology and

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.190 
advantage of the epic technology and
without<00:02:11.710> big<00:02:11.980> game<00:02:12.310> support<00:02:12.880> a<00:02:13.120> game<00:02:13.780> device

without big game support a game device
will<00:02:14.770> have<00:02:14.920> a<00:02:14.950> tough<00:02:15.310> fight<00:02:15.730> ahead<00:02:16.180> of<00:02:16.450> it<00:02:16.540> it

completely<00:02:19.600> naturally<00:02:20.200> and<00:02:20.410> I<00:02:20.680> think<00:02:21.490> there

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
completely naturally and I think there

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.400 
completely naturally and I think there
are<00:02:21.700> a<00:02:21.730> lot<00:02:21.760> of<00:02:22.050> developers<00:02:23.050> that<00:02:23.260> we're

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
are a lot of developers that we're

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.740 
are a lot of developers that we're
working<00:02:23.590> with<00:02:23.980> as<00:02:24.130> well<00:02:24.160> it<00:02:24.700> goes<00:02:24.880> way<00:02:25.420> beyond

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
working with as well it goes way beyond

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.540 
working with as well it goes way beyond
gaming<00:02:26.050> and<00:02:26.410> I<00:02:26.500> think<00:02:26.709> the<00:02:26.800> applications<00:02:27.400> to

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
gaming and I think the applications to

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.160 
gaming and I think the applications to
this<00:02:27.670> sort<00:02:27.880> of<00:02:27.940> technology<00:02:28.510> has<00:02:28.930> a<00:02:28.959> lot<00:02:29.140> of

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
this sort of technology has a lot of

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.850 
this sort of technology has a lot of
great<00:02:29.620> beneficial<00:02:30.040> effects<00:02:30.459> as<00:02:30.640> well
