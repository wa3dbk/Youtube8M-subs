roof<00:03:36.380> cement<00:03:37.570> yeah<00:03:38.570> well<00:03:38.780> do<00:03:39.140> that<00:03:39.170> you<00:03:39.530> know

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
roof cement yeah well do that you know

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.140 
roof cement yeah well do that you know
it's<00:03:39.769> like<00:03:40.700> a<00:03:40.760> 16<00:03:41.209> inch<00:03:41.870> in<00:03:42.140> thickness<00:03:43.150> just

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
it's like a 16 inch in thickness just

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.850 
it's like a 16 inch in thickness just
coat<00:03:44.330> pretty<00:03:44.660> good<00:03:44.840> and<00:03:45.260> this<00:03:45.470> is<00:03:45.709> the

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
coat pretty good and this is the

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.759 
coat pretty good and this is the
membrane<00:03:46.690> never<00:03:47.690> going<00:03:47.900> to<00:03:47.959> put<00:03:48.110> down<00:03:48.290> this<00:03:48.590> is

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
membrane never going to put down this is

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:52.509 
membrane never going to put down this is
how<00:03:48.890> it<00:03:49.040> comes<00:03:49.070> just<00:03:49.940> in<00:03:50.090> a<00:03:50.209> roll<00:03:51.250> and<00:03:52.250> you<00:03:52.430> can

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
how it comes just in a roll and you can

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:55.479 
how it comes just in a roll and you can
get<00:03:52.640> different<00:03:52.850> widths<00:03:53.500> I<00:03:54.500> like<00:03:54.950> the<00:03:55.130> four

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
get different widths I like the four

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:57.190 
get different widths I like the four
inch<00:03:55.670> roll<00:03:55.910> most<00:03:56.180> of<00:03:56.330> all<00:03:56.450> they<00:03:56.660> got<00:03:56.780> four<00:03:57.019> or

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
inch roll most of all they got four or

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.710 
inch roll most of all they got four or
six<00:03:57.440> and<00:03:57.769> you<00:03:58.640> know<00:03:58.760> just<00:03:58.820> done<00:03:59.150> you<00:03:59.269> think<00:03:59.330> one

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
six and you know just done you think one

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.020 
six and you know just done you think one
and<00:04:00.440> we'll<00:04:00.769> put<00:04:01.130> that<00:04:01.160> down<00:04:01.370> into<00:04:01.760> the<00:04:01.850> roots

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
and we'll put that down into the roots

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.690 
and we'll put that down into the roots
of<00:04:02.150> it<00:04:02.300> now<00:04:02.510> and<00:04:02.830> trial<00:04:03.830> it<00:04:03.980> in<00:04:04.130> a<00:04:04.160> bit<00:04:04.519> more

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
of it now and trial it in a bit more

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.390 
of it now and trial it in a bit more
recent<00:04:05.060> over<00:04:05.330> top<00:04:05.510> of<00:04:05.540> it<00:04:05.830> ok<00:04:06.830> now<00:04:07.040> we're<00:04:07.190> late

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
recent over top of it ok now we're late

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
recent over top of it ok now we're late
the<00:04:09.670> mesh<00:04:10.670> or<00:04:11.799> the<00:04:12.880> membrane<00:04:13.880> down<00:04:14.060> into<00:04:14.330> the

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
the mesh or the membrane down into the

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.070 
the mesh or the membrane down into the
roof<00:04:14.600> cement<00:04:15.220> and<00:04:16.220> we'll<00:04:16.400> just<00:04:16.549> take<00:04:16.669> a<00:04:17.080> hour

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.080 
roof cement and we'll just take a hour

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.350 
roof cement and we'll just take a hour
trial<00:04:18.669> just<00:04:19.669> kind<00:04:19.850> of<00:04:19.880> work<00:04:20.090> it<00:04:20.239> in

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
trial just kind of work it in

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.660 
trial just kind of work it in
is<00:04:22.930> present<00:04:23.500> firmly<00:04:23.740> down<00:04:24.039> in<00:04:24.280> there

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.610 

you're<00:04:27.240> not<00:04:27.390> trying<00:04:27.600> to<00:04:27.750> cover<00:04:28.050> with<00:04:28.350> what<00:04:28.500> we

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
you're not trying to cover with what we

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.110 
you're not trying to cover with what we
have<00:04:28.860> there<00:04:29.040> already

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.320 

I've<00:04:32.690> seen<00:04:32.900> it<00:04:33.050> in<00:04:33.080> some<00:04:33.350> areas<00:04:33.680> where<00:04:34.270> this<00:04:35.270> is

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
I've seen it in some areas where this is

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.150 
I've seen it in some areas where this is
all<00:04:35.570> they'll<00:04:35.810> do<00:04:36.020> is<00:04:36.050> put<00:04:36.440> it<00:04:36.560> down<00:04:36.740> a<00:04:37.040> little

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
all they'll do is put it down a little

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.010 
all they'll do is put it down a little
bit<00:04:37.280> of<00:04:37.400> root<00:04:37.520> some<00:04:37.669> it<00:04:37.790> down<00:04:38.030> put<00:04:38.990> the

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
bit of root some it down put the

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.010 
bit of root some it down put the
membrane<00:04:39.500> over<00:04:39.530> it<00:04:40.210> and<00:04:41.210> then<00:04:41.360> do<00:04:41.570> this<00:04:41.780> here

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
membrane over it and then do this here

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.620 
membrane over it and then do this here
then<00:04:42.169> they'll<00:04:42.350> leave<00:04:42.530> it<00:04:42.729> and<00:04:43.729> that's<00:04:44.449> not

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
then they'll leave it and that's not

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.900 
then they'll leave it and that's not
good<00:04:45.050> enough<00:04:45.290> because<00:04:45.760> this<00:04:46.760> membrane<00:04:47.389> will

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
good enough because this membrane will

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.580 
good enough because this membrane will
it<00:04:49.910> will<00:04:50.030> dry<00:04:50.270> out<00:04:50.300> and<00:04:50.750> it<00:04:51.139> will<00:04:51.260> crack<00:04:51.560> it

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
it will dry out and it will crack it

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.550 
it will dry out and it will crack it
will<00:04:51.949> come<00:04:52.130> up<00:04:52.870> it<00:04:53.870> just<00:04:54.080> won't<00:04:54.199> do<00:04:54.410> the<00:04:54.530> job

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
will come up it just won't do the job

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.070 
will come up it just won't do the job
that<00:04:54.770> is<00:04:55.070> supposed<00:04:55.310> to<00:04:55.400> do<00:04:55.600> and<00:04:56.600> what<00:04:56.900> we're

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
that is supposed to do and what we're

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.170 
that is supposed to do and what we're
doing<00:04:57.290> here<00:04:57.680> the<00:04:58.280> December<00:04:58.639> brings<00:04:58.820> just<00:04:59.030> like

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
doing here the December brings just like

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.879 
doing here the December brings just like
anything<00:04:59.389> else<00:04:59.600> is<00:04:59.840> just<00:04:59.870> a<00:05:00.050> reinforcement<00:05:00.560> of

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:00.889 
anything else is just a reinforcement of

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:04.900 
anything else is just a reinforcement of
the<00:05:01.460> roof<00:05:01.729> cement<00:05:02.120> and<00:05:03.190> it<00:05:04.190> will<00:05:04.310> keep<00:05:04.490> this

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:04.910 
the roof cement and it will keep this

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.920 
the roof cement and it will keep this
crack<00:05:05.240> from<00:05:06.280> for<00:05:07.280> this<00:05:07.430> lap<00:05:07.729> if<00:05:08.539> there<00:05:08.780> is<00:05:08.900> a

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
crack from for this lap if there is a

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:10.960 
crack from for this lap if there is a
crack<00:05:09.229> here<00:05:09.530> that<00:05:10.280> it<00:05:10.400> will<00:05:10.550> keep<00:05:10.669> it<00:05:10.850> from

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
crack here that it will keep it from

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.750 
crack here that it will keep it from
cracking<00:05:11.380> and<00:05:12.380> opening<00:05:13.039> up<00:05:13.160> and<00:05:13.460> that's<00:05:13.610> what

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:13.760 
cracking and opening up and that's what

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.279 
cracking and opening up and that's what
will<00:05:13.940> happen<00:05:14.090> if<00:05:14.360> you<00:05:14.389> just<00:05:14.630> put<00:05:14.810> through

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:15.289 
will happen if you just put through

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:20.439 
will happen if you just put through
cement<00:05:15.620> down<00:05:15.860> and<00:05:16.220> no<00:05:17.120> membrane<00:05:18.280> so<00:05:19.330> you<00:05:20.330> know

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:20.449 
cement down and no membrane so you know

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:23.230 
cement down and no membrane so you know
risk<00:05:21.080> minute<00:05:21.350> hold<00:05:21.470> up<00:05:21.590> for<00:05:21.800> a<00:05:21.830> while<00:05:22.010> but<00:05:23.000> over

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 
risk minute hold up for a while but over

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.900 
risk minute hold up for a while but over
time<00:05:23.479> when<00:05:23.810> it<00:05:23.930> gets<00:05:24.110> hard<00:05:24.460> it<00:05:25.460> takes<00:05:25.639> a<00:05:25.729> lot<00:05:25.760> of

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910 
time when it gets hard it takes a lot of

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.640 
time when it gets hard it takes a lot of
heart<00:05:26.180> enough

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:30.469 

it<00:05:29.250> will<00:05:29.460> crack<00:05:29.790> and<00:05:29.820> you'll<00:05:30.150> have<00:05:30.330> problems

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:30.479 
it will crack and you'll have problems

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:33.770 
it will crack and you'll have problems
again<00:05:31.400> so<00:05:32.400> you<00:05:32.759> want<00:05:32.940> to<00:05:33.000> do<00:05:33.090> it<00:05:33.210> this<00:05:33.330> way<00:05:33.570> and

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
again so you want to do it this way and

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.469 
again so you want to do it this way and
that<00:05:33.810> way<00:05:33.900> you<00:05:34.110> only<00:05:34.169> do<00:05:34.410> it<00:05:34.440> once<00:05:35.030> and<00:05:36.030> this

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 
that way you only do it once and this

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:40.310 
that way you only do it once and this
will<00:05:36.660> last<00:05:36.840> a<00:05:37.139> lot<00:05:37.470> of<00:05:37.710> years<00:05:38.810> it<00:05:39.810> will<00:05:39.990> it<00:05:40.289> will

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 
will last a lot of years it will it will

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.850 
will last a lot of years it will it will
it<00:05:40.680> will<00:05:40.949> outlast<00:05:41.460> the<00:05:41.880> roof<00:05:42.030> is<00:05:42.210> on<00:05:42.330> here<00:05:42.570> now

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:42.860 
it will outlast the roof is on here now

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:47.810 
it will outlast the roof is on here now
and<00:05:43.860> put<00:05:44.100> it<00:05:44.190> that<00:05:44.310> way<00:05:45.710> say<00:05:46.710> just

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:47.820 
and put it that way say just

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:54.330 
and put it that way say just
keep<00:05:48.450> traveling<00:05:48.990> on<00:05:49.140> there

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:54.340 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:06:07.860 

make<00:05:55.340> sure<00:05:55.370> you<00:05:55.640> got<00:05:55.760> it<00:05:55.940> covered<00:05:56.090> real<00:05:56.450> well

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:07.870 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:09.510 

when<00:06:08.380> you<00:06:08.470> get<00:06:08.590> towards<00:06:08.800> then<00:06:09.070> just<00:06:09.310> try<00:06:09.460> to

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.520 
when you get towards then just try to

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:10.710 
when you get towards then just try to
pull<00:06:09.760> it<00:06:09.790> out<00:06:10.000> so<00:06:10.210> you<00:06:10.300> don't<00:06:10.330> get<00:06:10.540> any

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 
pull it out so you don't get any

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:23.780 
pull it out so you don't get any
wrinkles<00:06:11.110> in<00:06:11.260> it

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:23.790 

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:25.430 

and<00:06:24.300> that's<00:06:24.480> how<00:06:24.570> you<00:06:24.660> repair<00:06:25.020> a<00:06:25.050> lake<00:06:25.260> with<00:06:25.380> a

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.440 
and that's how you repair a lake with a

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.430 
and that's how you repair a lake with a
roofs<00:06:25.650> in<00:06:25.800> that<00:06:25.950> membrane

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:28.440 
roofs in that membrane

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.470 
roofs in that membrane
that'll<00:06:29.190> solve<00:06:29.400> a<00:06:29.580> lot<00:06:29.730> of<00:06:29.790> problems<00:06:30.300> and<00:06:30.420> a

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:30.480 
that'll solve a lot of problems and a

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.420 
that'll solve a lot of problems and a
lot<00:06:30.510> of<00:06:30.660> roots<00:06:30.960> if<00:06:31.170> it's<00:06:31.320> done<00:06:31.500> correctly<00:06:31.530> if

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:32.430 
lot of roots if it's done correctly if

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:36.660 
lot of roots if it's done correctly if
you<00:06:32.580> can<00:06:32.730> find<00:06:32.940> the<00:06:33.120> leak<00:06:33.560> you<00:06:34.560> got<00:06:34.740> it<00:06:34.860> made

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:36.670 
you can find the leak you got it made

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:38.700 
you can find the leak you got it made
