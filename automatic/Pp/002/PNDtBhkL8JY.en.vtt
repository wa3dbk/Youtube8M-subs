00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 as you know we have been for some 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.640
 days in the training camp I wanted you 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.090
 a little insight into our 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.130
 give hotel and your questions of course 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.530
 also a little answer so first 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.199
 times this is the room of lisanne 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.350
 I have a small apartment 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.270
 together with vanessa and mana and me 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.410
 We believe it fits in well with us 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.630
 feel comfortable here 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.199
 then you want a little bit of you 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:32.600
 show where we are here again and 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:35.700
 it would be the second time four so devoted 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:38.219
 So very nice here in the middle of the 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.040
 involve cycling in Fretter bit 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:45.180
 worse but actually with questions 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:49.579
 about super weather to ask me 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.809
 so have our daily routine 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:54.840
 actually sees every day relatively 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.860
 similarly from we have breakfast at half past one 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.420
 nine 9 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.789
 then one is the first 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.329
 training session on the program 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.580
 around 10 o'clock are about then 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.590
 Of course, every day different contents 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.760
 sometimes tactical content is one 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:14.220
 sometimes quality and endurance 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:16.310
 stories in and tomorrow 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.659
 of course, the tournament 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.540
 It continues after the first training 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.090
 with the lunch around 13 o'clock afterwards 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.619
 is a small lunch break and then 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.280
 Actually, it's already time for the second 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.710
 training and after the second training 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.420
 is also time for regeneration 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.549
 we can we 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.320
 to use the wellness possibilities here 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.720
 or just the eisbach the before our 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.149
 Of course, door is also a physio 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.210
 go and eat around 19 o'clock then we eat 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:48.479
 usually to evening and afterwards 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:51.390
 either a meeting on or 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.159
 we can be treated again 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.210
 to go to the physically or then have 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.869
 maybe even in the evening just one 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.240
 little time for us yes I believe that 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.450
 So the most common questions you asked 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.000
 I personally asked 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.569
 of course also train individually 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.920
 here 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:11.039
 I can not work with the team 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:14.970
 but work out in the power range 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.410
 in the gym or maybe in the 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.130
 next day already a little bit on 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:22.530
 Platzes so that you can do that 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.799
 is the rough insight in ours 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.799
 hotel
