 he saw in this pitiful we will therefore approach 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.720
 the Israeli blockade interface in the fall the live as we are 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.070
 here in a 7-0 version in Pool 4 

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:15.689
 on platform 

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:18.689
 happy if qsi leopard 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.019
 so urgent this software being designed for the stage 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:26.089
 from beginning to actually doing what he says 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:29.389
 computer scientists have looked at reached programming 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.079
 900 overlay of two windows so there is no multi-window 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:36.300
 nike 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.480
 likewise if it's obviously there 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.500
 very handy for the stage 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.469
 it also wants everyday 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:46.029
 120% serse stone have two overlaid defeats 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.130
 and lose and in the momentum of time to seek information for the stars 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.370
 keystone photo how they did it's very simple 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:01.140
 we will say that in fact we have three large parts so two parts fillon 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.129
 in fact that the material 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:05.030
 Devolin 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.540
 so 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.210
 to summarize we tried to kill 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.980
 it was actually 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.560
 two calls in celebration the blender missing the call actually maybe 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.210
 mixing 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.210
 first thing to know if I can so on the key tobacco 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.390
 happy so 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.880
 from my keyboard 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.710
 switch between sight 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.380
 arrangements with the construction arrangement alas seen your case of 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.380
 messages with producers 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.870
 other things or also 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.250
 nthe browser documents on the batch 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.580
 with a choice of a corner of the screen 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.860
 for this party that is here 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.740
 is it the same we can make it appear the mass which is very 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:47.950
 quickly with him 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.350
 the keys count these themes of the commands 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.730
 more to the act 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.650
 in the option crash 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.590
 and a dh so it's amd stop 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:58.870
 ebay 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.870
 for the second will be 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.950
 we can also completely 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.450
 we do not rush on computer sales anymore than you do the 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.029
 lead-free touching them the richest of the lot 

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:12.559
 of the keyboard 

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:15.079
 so other in the right than left 

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:16.629
 yet done 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:20.189
 villiers in this holiday so if just connect two times 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:22.769
 the coach 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:26.400
 no, but what do I believe in it because I will cover the files with the 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.399
 left buttock 

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:28.599
 close the folder 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:31.219
 which are obviously highlighted 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:32.409
 the sheet 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:34.279
 in the Netherlands allow it 

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:37.279
 to navigate my different folders 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.220
 mejean years old I need the team without a mouse looking for them in the folder 

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:45.079
 eclipse 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:46.509
 whose act 

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:48.259
 they are for example 

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:51.259
 his urge is due to a loop of 22 patrick 

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:53.590
 still a done right 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.320
 still enough perspective are so named archives 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.320
 and then I did not do much anymore what he has to do 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:02.120
 the driver to launch the press 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.299
 deviation 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:04.849
 hurry up 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:07.029
 princes 

00:03:07.029 --> 00:03:08.859
 typical 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:10.060
 planned Iraqis 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.949
 Sarkozy 

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:14.949
 bush plus the choice of keyboard 

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:18.099
 after the pub for the lake 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:21.279
 so I can in this way carry such missiles 

00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:24.279
 the costumes 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:28.359
 ground 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:32.109
 standing up later 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:34.879
 coursan 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:36.999
 the mouse 

00:03:36.999 --> 00:03:39.999
 I challenged a little 

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:44.499
 convenient 

00:03:44.499 --> 00:03:45.899
 then 

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:47.909
 in life you have help 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:49.829
 which is actually 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.679
 Well, it's well done 

00:03:51.679 --> 00:03:55.899
 so for the insert party also appear on the shift key plus the 

00:03:55.899 --> 00:03:58.899
 skin of a question mark so we will adorn ourselves 

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:02.409
 I want to make my day my name 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:05.929
 on the road that side I do not know in fact just a good mouse 

00:04:05.929 --> 00:04:07.709
 on an element 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.629
 for the game the information relating to what he missed his 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:13.139
 plug so 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:15.389
 in the location of the city 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:18.370
 it's educational 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.680
 why up to line 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.099
 for the tourism 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:26.099
 then in the lower part 

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:30.159
 here is a little you do like them in the arrangement 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.930
 and the mixer which over fly m 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.830
 so the first if it is to deposit instruments how much effort they 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.469
 are playing 

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:42.779
 so power have passed 

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:44.139
 windows about 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:48.389
 we talk about it and who will be publishing so the edition of midi editions for lyon 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:50.340
 art 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.979
 the windows it will concern rather the most inhuman 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:56.979
 heroux instruments 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.000
 to switch from one to another which are symbolized actually here being 202 

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:07.050
 the ssii uppercase lucic cammas but since the term here is 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.110
 I do not go instantly to each other 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.260
 so what are seeking to retain yet mutual saw that the arrangement 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:14.909
 tobacco 

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:16.430
 yet as soon as he saw 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.490
 of publishing and instruments put them pay 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.939
 but until October 

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:25.069
 so to hide this lower part so that only serves that 

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:28.439
 business edition conduril a choice 

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:29.449
 but unfair 

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:31.719
 condensed souls of the victims 

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:34.009
 the themes 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:35.569
 here 

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:38.130
 so in fact the fastest to find it 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.650
 with a surface completely dedicated to the previous edition or not 

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:47.240
 I think in fact what I lost 30 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.529
 So I do not touch absolutely in Mosul 

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:52.400
 these advantages 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.389
 last thing too so we gained some room on the screens we can 

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:58.689
 also work in full screen mode 

00:05:58.689 --> 00:06:01.169
 we did not count acquired social point of view 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:02.969
 keyboard shortcuts 

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:06.009
 follow our display the full screen mode is the key earth 

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:10.669
 unfortunately by default on maquis keyboards and loss keys 

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:13.669
 - it touches only the sound poem 

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:18.339
 however the attacker so we try to koulikoro who compensate their 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.660
 so here it's the same I switch to full screen mode I can I do what I 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:26.990
 want is infected with the flu kills everything works the same 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:30.190
 you'll tell me okay but how to go back and then he 

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:33.529
 have to keep it here all the time to reach top of the screen 

00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:36.969
 a little day to all and I click on as much 

00:06:36.969 --> 00:06:40.050
 I will have a men tourmag com display mode 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:42.180
 paducah the screen 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:45.190
 So here are not the elected officials who shortened yesterday 

00:06:47.619 --> 00:06:50.490
 these themes of the pilots b 

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:51.610
 library 

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:54.419
 these canines halts she 

00:06:54.419 --> 00:06:56.949
 regarding the publishing component 

00:06:56.949 --> 00:06:58.749
 capitalized tarbes 

00:06:58.749 --> 00:07:01.749
 I allowed my editing flaps 

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:05.249
 and capital letters for tourism 

00:07:05.249 --> 00:07:07.800
 for the window 

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.240
 dancers - 

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.159
 that's for those who have the north 

00:07:13.159 --> 00:07:15.249
 another ten have aborted 

00:07:15.249 --> 00:07:18.709
 we will learn pepper d he advised that life and that allow 

00:07:19.349 --> 00:07:22.599
 daudet much faster to human work I think it's also a 

00:07:22.599 --> 00:07:25.869
 question of cost comfort that's it 

00:07:25.869 --> 00:07:27.319
 and have a good time 

00:07:27.319 --> 00:07:28.839
 memorization and soon
