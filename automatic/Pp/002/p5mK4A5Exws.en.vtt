00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.410
 for you ok ok let's start with a 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.580
 yeast sachet this sachet what 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.580
 you can find in any 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:07.759
 supermarket ok we're going to add a 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:10.970
 teaspoon of sugar and also a cup 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:13.070
 of hot water at 120 to 130 degrees 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.740
 fahrenheit very important that is 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.110
 hot we mix it together with a 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.050
 tablespoon of oil and a teaspoon of 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.600
 salt ok now we are going to add our 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.210
 flour a cup of flour and mix it 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.550
 very well after that we're going to 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.259
 add another cup of flour and we're going to 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.810
 mix but they will realize that it is 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:35.390
 a bit difficult ok and it's time to 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.310
 knead it with your hands are also going to 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.780
 realize that it's a little sticky like that 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.670
 that we have to add flour and 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.659
 knead it until you leave us a 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.960
 consistency 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:46.880
 and elastic and soft we formed it in a 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.859
 little ball so we put them in a 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.109
 container together with a trickle of 

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:53.240
 oil the oil just so that it does not 

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:55.429
 I know that we will cover the mass with a 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.409
 plastic and we're going to let it rest 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:00.829
 one hour a little more until it 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:04.609

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:08.450

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.459
 four pieces ok in half and by the 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:18.590
 half again because four pieces 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.720

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.260
 with a plastic and we have to leave them 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.659

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:36.480
 that our dough balls grow a 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:39.750
