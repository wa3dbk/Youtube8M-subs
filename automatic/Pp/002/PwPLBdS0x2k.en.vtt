00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.980
 Gregor Mendel is mainly for one 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.990
 geniously known his crossing 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.410
 experimenting with peas 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:30.590
 but we start from the beginning gregor 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:33.059
 Mendel lived from 1822 to 1884 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.340
 actually Mendel was called gregor 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.559
 but john by first name 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.920
 only when he decided to become a monk 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:44.010
 he got the name gregorius or just 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.390
 Gregor Mendel lived in one 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.640
 monastery in Brno 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.429
 He spent most of his time there 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.350
 Klostergarten here he bred peas 

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:55.320
 Planting different varieties 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.749
 intersects with each other for example 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.359
 peas plant with yellow peas and 

00:00:57.749 --> 00:01:02.569
 plants with green peas whose 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.650
 descendants all had yellow peas 

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:07.290
 mendel now crossed these offspring 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.690
 He made another one for himself 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.479
 him at first unexplainable discovery 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.640
 Mendel counted many peas 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.010
 to a lesser extent, however, too 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.690
 green peas after several 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.119
 repetitions and much counting 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:24.689
 karwendel on a ratio of three to 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.790
 one of yellow to green peas mendel 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.329
 Initially, no rhyme was possible 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.030
 do 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:32.340
 at that time, there was none 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.259
 high-resolution microscopes and also the 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.439
 dna was not yet as the carrier of 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.539
 erbguts decrypted all the more amazing 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.030
 was mendel's conclusions 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:47.670
 they later became known as the three 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:49.859
 mendelschen number one the yellow ones 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.439
 pea color is dominant over the 

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:55.530
 Repressed recessive green peas 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:58.020
 Color that means when you plant both 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.570
 the yellow crosses each other 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.939
 color through all the peas are the same 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.649
 namely money 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:07.520
 that's why the first male rule 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:10.050
 also called uniformity rule 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.420
 go on with the second male 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.910
 rule kreutzmann now namely the 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.010
 Michigan is planting with the yellow peas 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.770
 so you get in the following 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:23.849
 generation of yellow and green peas and 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:25.080
 although in the ratio 3 to 1 only if two 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.560
 recessive to 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.600
 together are the pea green the 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.380
 second male rule is therefore too 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:36.330
 called fission rule 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.520
 these findings alone were already 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.640
 a true geniestreich of mendel 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.350
 but he went on looking Mendel 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.750
 also the inheritance of two 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.270
 different characteristics to those of 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.330
 green wrinkled peas and those of 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:54.090
 yellow round hearts so the color and 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.790
 The shape of the peas crossed mendel 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:02.220
 There were only plants with these characteristics 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:04.560
 descendants with yellow round peas the 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.990
 Mendel was surprised by the next crossings 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.690
 but suddenly there was next to the 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:11.670
 known variants yellow and red and 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.880
 green and wrinkled too new 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:18.180
 combinations namely yellow wrinkled 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.920
 peas and green peas again 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.770
 relied on his mentally tough 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:28.170
 arts and statistics he came on 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:30.120
 ratio of 9 to 3 to 3 to 1 the 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.510
 Features were therefore independent 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.100
 been recombined from each other 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:39.260
 that's why the third male rule 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.260
 Also called new combination rule 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:45.590
 In 1866, Mendel first published the 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:48.840
 results of his crossing attempts 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:51.930
 Overall, he had just under 30,000 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.330
 plants examined in eight years for 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.130
 his groundbreaking discoveries could 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.410
 At first, however, nobody really cares 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.120
 excite 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.580
 Mendel devoted himself more to that 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.830
 living in the monastery years later 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:07.830
 mendes records were again 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:10.380
 discovered since then is mendl for his 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:12.620
 geniestreiche known as father of 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.620
 genetics
