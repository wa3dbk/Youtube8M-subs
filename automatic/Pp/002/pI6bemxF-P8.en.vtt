00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:08.189
 winter pike fishing is pretty 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.170
 sport fishing to start you need 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.080
 to overcome a half kilometer on 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.799
 snow drifts naturally with fishing 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.379
 dicom cord 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.960
 by the way one of us managed all the same 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.240
 right near the shore 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.150
 despite the fact that the thickness of the ice 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.060
 reached 15 centimeters at the same time 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.769
 It was mid December about meters 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.270
 50 we set 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.590
 stumblers it was our race distance 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:38.010
 the next step is to install 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.800
 tents and start catching bait faster 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.489
 this moment lives practically not 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:48.210
 got caught 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:51.000
 or was caught very, very badly and you know 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.030
 when exactly the pike starts to peck yes 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:17.900
 when I just sit down to drink tea or go 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:17.900
 Out of need, he unwound everything completely 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:31.650
 single bite worked 5 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:39.020
 the purpose 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.020
 gabon catch along with if 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:55.830
 my life worked 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:02:14.110

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:26.950

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:37.950

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:37.950
 kilometer even historical shooting 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.610
 So 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:27.849

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.609

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:32.360
 I waited not provide delivered 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:35.220

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:44.449
