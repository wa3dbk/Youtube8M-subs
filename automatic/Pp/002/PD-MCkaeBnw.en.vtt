00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
we're going to look at another of my top

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.769 
we're going to look at another of my top
5<00:00:19.710> 38<00:00:20.010> weeks<00:00:20.279> so<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:20.880> get<00:00:21.029> things<00:00:21.300> started<00:00:21.510> off

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
5 38 weeks so to get things started off

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:22.759 
5 38 weeks so to get things started off
again<00:00:22.080> we're<00:00:22.230> looking<00:00:22.410> at<00:00:22.500> a<00:00:22.529> tweak<00:00:22.740> called

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
again we're looking at a tweak called

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.859 
again we're looking at a tweak called
download<00:00:23.310> move<00:00:23.550> now<00:00:24.090> as<00:00:24.300> you'll<00:00:24.539> know<00:00:24.720> when

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
download move now as you'll know when

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:25.910 
download move now as you'll know when
you<00:00:24.900> download<00:00:25.289> an<00:00:25.410> app<00:00:25.560> from<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.740> App<00:00:25.890> Store

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
you download an app from the App Store

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.950 
you download an app from the App Store
you<00:00:26.310> obviously<00:00:26.550> get<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.730> status<00:00:27.210> bar<00:00:27.300> that

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
you obviously get the status bar that

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.630 
you obviously get the status bar that
shows<00:00:27.990> you<00:00:28.349> how<00:00:28.380> far<00:00:28.800> along<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.160> download<00:00:29.460> you

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
shows you how far along the download you

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.310 
shows you how far along the download you
are<00:00:29.789> so<00:00:30.210> this<00:00:30.359> tweak<00:00:30.660> allows<00:00:30.869> you<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.170> move

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
are so this tweak allows you to move

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.229 
are so this tweak allows you to move
that<00:00:31.560> up<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:31.890> down<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.430> icon<00:00:32.820> then<00:00:33.030> sort<00:00:33.210> of

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
that up and down the icon then sort of

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.639 
that up and down the icon then sort of
position<00:00:33.390> where<00:00:33.780> you<00:00:33.840> want<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.140> have<00:00:34.260> that<00:00:34.469> and

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
position where you want to have that and

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.770 
position where you want to have that and
also<00:00:35.219> it<00:00:35.579> shows<00:00:35.790> you<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.450> download

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
also it shows you the download

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.020 
also it shows you the download
percentage<00:00:37.410> if<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:37.739> would<00:00:37.890> like<00:00:38.100> so<00:00:38.760> that's

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
percentage if you would like so that's

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.630 
percentage if you would like so that's
kind<00:00:39.329> of<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.480> turn<00:00:39.660> one<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.260> if<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:40.920> may<00:00:41.399> well

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
kind of a turn one and if you may well

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.819 
kind of a turn one and if you may well
know<00:00:41.670> from<00:00:42.149> watch<00:00:42.329> my<00:00:42.540> other<00:00:42.570> top<00:00:42.930> fives<00:00:43.200> that

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
know from watch my other top fives that

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.590 
know from watch my other top fives that
I've<00:00:43.980> reviewed<00:00:44.399> at<00:00:44.610> we<00:00:44.760> called<00:00:45.000> absent<00:00:45.480> which

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
I've reviewed at we called absent which

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.150 
I've reviewed at we called absent which
actually<00:00:45.780> does<00:00:46.079> that<00:00:46.110> say<00:00:46.530> percentage<00:00:46.980> thing

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
actually does that say percentage thing

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.010 
actually does that say percentage thing
so<00:00:47.399> this<00:00:47.820> is<00:00:47.969> great<00:00:48.120> because<00:00:48.360> it's<00:00:48.629> sort<00:00:48.930> of

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
so this is great because it's sort of

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.439 
so this is great because it's sort of
two<00:00:49.170> in<00:00:49.320> one<00:00:49.530> so<00:00:50.190> we'll<00:00:50.640> quickly<00:00:50.879> just<00:00:51.090> go<00:00:51.239> into

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
two in one so we'll quickly just go into

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.840 
two in one so we'll quickly just go into
the<00:00:51.539> settings<00:00:51.750> beforehand<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:53.489> can<00:00:53.640> see

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
the settings beforehand and you can see

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.180 
the settings beforehand and you can see
you<00:00:54.090> can<00:00:54.239> have<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.570> position<00:00:55.050> as<00:00:55.230> set<00:00:56.010> to

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
you can have the position as set to

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.670 
you can have the position as set to
middle<00:00:56.610> top<00:00:56.910> bottom<00:00:57.449> Apple<00:00:57.780> down<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.530> then

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
middle top bottom Apple down and then

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.189 
middle top bottom Apple down and then
obviously<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:59.129> percentage<00:00:59.640> is<00:00:59.670> on<00:01:00.090> or<00:01:00.239> off<00:01:00.270> so

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
obviously the percentage is on or off so

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.049 
obviously the percentage is on or off so
we'll<00:01:01.320> go<00:01:01.440> ahead<00:01:01.559> into<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.370> app<00:01:02.550> store<00:01:02.579> here

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
we'll go ahead into the app store here

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.789 
we'll go ahead into the app store here
and<00:01:03.210> then<00:01:04.110> we<00:01:04.199> can<00:01:04.229> just<00:01:04.379> go<00:01:04.589> ahead<00:01:04.619> and

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
and then we can just go ahead and

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.469 
and then we can just go ahead and
download<00:01:05.100> an<00:01:05.460> app<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:05.880> can<00:01:05.909> sort<00:01:06.270> of<00:01:06.330> see

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
download an app and you can sort of see

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.690 
download an app and you can sort of see
the<00:01:07.110> positioning<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.710> things<00:01:07.920> so<00:01:08.430> just<00:01:08.610> go

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
the positioning and things so just go

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.070 
the positioning and things so just go
ahead<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:08.909> download<00:01:09.090> this<00:01:09.420> one<00:01:09.600> shooting

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
ahead and download this one shooting

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.250 
ahead and download this one shooting
showdown<00:01:10.760> so<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:11.850> can<00:01:11.970> see<00:01:12.150> there<00:01:12.420> other<00:01:13.110> if

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
showdown so you can see there other if

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.929 
showdown so you can see there other if
you<00:01:13.320> can<00:01:13.439> see<00:01:13.560> that<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:14.040> progress<00:01:14.580> bar<00:01:14.760> is

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
you can see that the progress bar is

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.580 
you can see that the progress bar is
kind<00:01:15.180> of<00:01:15.270> in<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.450> middle<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.900> icon<00:01:16.380> there

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
kind of in the middle of the icon there

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.260 
kind of in the middle of the icon there
and<00:01:16.890> also<00:01:17.340> underneath<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:17.909> have<00:01:18.090> the

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
and also underneath you have the

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.149 
and also underneath you have the
percentage<00:01:18.780> of<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.930> download<00:01:19.409> so<00:01:19.979> this<00:01:20.130> is

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
percentage of the download so this is

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.530 
percentage of the download so this is
quite<00:01:20.490> think<00:01:20.700> it's<00:01:20.820> quite<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.030> big<00:01:21.150> file<00:01:21.390> this

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
quite think it's quite a big file this

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.670 
quite think it's quite a big file this
one<00:01:21.750> so<00:01:21.960> it's<00:01:22.080> going<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.229> take<00:01:22.380> quite<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.619> while

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
one so it's going to take quite a while

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.469 
one so it's going to take quite a while
but<00:01:23.340> hopefully<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:23.729> can<00:01:23.820> see<00:01:24.060> that<00:01:24.299> there

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
but hopefully you can see that there

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.580 
but hopefully you can see that there
that<00:01:24.600> you've<00:01:24.689> got<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.900> percentage<00:01:25.409> at<00:01:25.500> the

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
that you've got the percentage at the

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.080 
that you've got the percentage at the
bottom<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.369> then<00:01:26.520> sort<00:01:26.729> of<00:01:26.790> like<00:01:26.970> the

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
bottom and then sort of like the

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.330 
bottom and then sort of like the
progress<00:01:27.479> bar<00:01:27.689> in<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.930> middle<00:01:28.110> so<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.130> great

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
progress bar in the middle so a great

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.999 
progress bar in the middle so a great
little<00:01:29.490> tweak<00:01:29.820> that<00:01:30.659> one<00:01:30.810> is<00:01:31.020> called<00:01:31.350> download

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
sending I messages and they're actually

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.240

coming<00:02:03.270> up<00:02:03.479> as<00:02:03.659> green<00:02:03.960> so<00:02:04.649> if<00:02:05.009> you<00:02:05.100> want<00:02:05.219> to

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
coming up as green so if you want to

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.440

have it all green and that looks really

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.479 
have it all green and that looks really
good<00:02:06.540> i<00:02:06.689> mean<00:02:06.930> obviously<00:02:07.290> you<00:02:07.860> really<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.340> bit

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
good i mean obviously you really a bit

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.350 
good i mean obviously you really a bit
more<00:02:08.610> difficult<00:02:08.789> to<00:02:09.060> tell<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.270> difference

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
more difficult to tell the difference

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.940 
more difficult to tell the difference
when<00:02:09.869> you're<00:02:10.050> sort<00:02:10.289> of<00:02:10.319> our<00:02:10.440> messaging<00:02:10.830> or

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
when you're sort of our messaging or

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.710 
when you're sort of our messaging or
text<00:02:11.220> messaging<00:02:11.610> but<00:02:12.120> it<00:02:12.180> gives<00:02:12.270> it<00:02:12.480> an<00:02:12.569> all

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
text messaging but it gives it an all

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.890 
text messaging but it gives it an all
nice<00:02:12.959> unified<00:02:13.440> little

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
nice unified little

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.539 
nice unified little
and<00:02:14.110> I<00:02:14.230> definitely<00:02:14.530> prefer<00:02:14.739> the<00:02:15.040> green<00:02:15.159> to<00:02:15.430> the

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:15.549 
and I definitely prefer the green to the

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:17.610 
and I definitely prefer the green to the
blue<00:02:15.730> anyway<00:02:16.120> really<00:02:16.480> so<00:02:16.989> you<00:02:17.079> can<00:02:17.230> see<00:02:17.409> there

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
blue anyway really so you can see there

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.649 
blue anyway really so you can see there
that's<00:02:17.769> a<00:02:17.950> really<00:02:18.220> good<00:02:18.400> little<00:02:18.760> tweak<00:02:19.420> so

00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:19.659 
that's a really good little tweak so

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:22.770 
that's a really good little tweak so
that<00:02:19.810> one<00:02:19.959> is<00:02:19.989> called<00:02:20.530> I<00:02:20.799> text<00:02:21.370> message<00:02:21.780> okay

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
that one is called I text message okay

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.270 
that one is called I text message okay
coming<00:02:23.019> up<00:02:23.170> next<00:02:23.379> we're<00:02:23.620> looking<00:02:23.860> at<00:02:23.950> a<00:02:23.980> tweak

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
coming up next we're looking at a tweak

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.309 
coming up next we're looking at a tweak
called<00:02:24.310> page<00:02:25.180> numbers<00:02:25.720> now<00:02:25.930> you<00:02:25.989> might<00:02:26.230> have

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
called page numbers now you might have

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:28.470 
called page numbers now you might have
noticed<00:02:26.349> that<00:02:26.860> on<00:02:27.310> my<00:02:27.640> springboard<00:02:27.909> here<00:02:28.269> in

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
noticed that on my springboard here in

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.360 
noticed that on my springboard here in
two<00:02:28.629> little<00:02:29.049> dots<00:02:29.230> at<00:02:29.409> the<00:02:29.439> bottom<00:02:29.500> here<00:02:29.950> we've

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
two little dots at the bottom here we've

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.369 
two little dots at the bottom here we've
got<00:02:30.400> the<00:02:30.819> little<00:02:31.030> icons<00:02:31.540> with<00:02:31.750> the<00:02:31.930> numbers<00:02:32.230> on

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:32.379 
got the little icons with the numbers on

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:34.259 
got the little icons with the numbers on
so<00:02:32.829> I've<00:02:33.040> only<00:02:33.220> actually<00:02:33.549> got<00:02:33.640> to<00:02:33.819> home<00:02:34.060> screen

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
so I've only actually got to home screen

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:36.479 
so I've only actually got to home screen
T<00:02:34.569> so<00:02:34.629> if<00:02:34.810> I<00:02:34.870> slide<00:02:35.140> across<00:02:35.439> you<00:02:35.680> can<00:02:35.739> see<00:02:36.069> this

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
T so if I slide across you can see this

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.250 
T so if I slide across you can see this
is<00:02:36.670> two<00:02:36.939> and<00:02:37.239> then<00:02:37.420> one<00:02:37.450> and<00:02:37.989> then<00:02:38.079> when<00:02:38.170> you

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
is two and then one and then when you

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.539 
is two and then one and then when you
start<00:02:38.530> over<00:02:38.680> to<00:02:38.769> the<00:02:38.890> spot<00:02:39.099> like<00:02:39.280> that<00:02:39.310> is

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
start over to the spot like that is

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:42.240 
start over to the spot like that is
actually<00:02:39.970> 0<00:02:40.150> and<00:02:41.109> so<00:02:41.500> you<00:02:41.590> can<00:02:41.709> see<00:02:41.890> there<00:02:42.099> if

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
actually 0 and so you can see there if

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.860 
actually 0 and so you can see there if
this<00:02:42.700> is<00:02:42.849> probably<00:02:43.030> bit<00:02:43.209> more<00:02:43.359> useful<00:02:43.750> with

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
this is probably bit more useful with

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.509 
this is probably bit more useful with
you<00:02:44.019> have<00:02:44.230> a<00:02:44.409> number<00:02:44.980> of<00:02:45.069> different<00:02:45.159> home

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
you have a number of different home

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.190 
you have a number of different home
screens<00:02:45.549> maybe<00:02:46.239> you<00:02:46.389> know<00:02:46.510> five<00:02:46.810> six<00:02:47.079> seven

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
screens maybe you know five six seven

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.780 
screens maybe you know five six seven
that<00:02:47.470> sort<00:02:47.680> of<00:02:47.709> thing<00:02:47.769> you<00:02:48.340> sort<00:02:48.579> of<00:02:48.609> know

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
that sort of thing you sort of know

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.729 
that sort of thing you sort of know
where<00:02:49.000> you<00:02:49.120> are<00:02:49.299> exactly<00:02:49.750> on<00:02:49.870> which<00:02:50.319> sort<00:02:50.709> of

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
where you are exactly on which sort of

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.770 
where you are exactly on which sort of
page<00:02:50.920> number<00:02:51.370> so<00:02:51.909> that's<00:02:52.060> sort<00:02:52.269> of<00:02:52.359> signs<00:02:52.540> bear

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
page number so that's sort of signs bear

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.300 
page number so that's sort of signs bear
in<00:02:52.870> mind<00:02:53.049> and<00:02:53.260> that's<00:02:53.379> a<00:02:53.500> little<00:02:53.739> tweak<00:02:53.980> just

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
in mind and that's a little tweak just

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.490 
in mind and that's a little tweak just
called<00:02:54.579> page<00:02:54.879> numbers<00:02:55.329> so<00:02:55.900> if<00:02:56.109> you<00:02:56.200> want<00:02:56.349> to<00:02:56.409> go

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
called page numbers so if you want to go
