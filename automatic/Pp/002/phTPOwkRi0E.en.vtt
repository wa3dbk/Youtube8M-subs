00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
slow as you have to go count five make

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.200 
slow as you have to go count five make
sure<00:04:42.590> the<00:04:42.740> first<00:04:42.919> one's<00:04:43.160> a<00:04:43.250> downstroke<00:04:43.760> and

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
sure the first one's a downstroke and

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:45.870 
sure the first one's a downstroke and
the<00:04:44.300> next<00:04:44.510> batch<00:04:44.660> of<00:04:44.690> five<00:04:44.930> is<00:04:45.110> an<00:04:45.230> upstroke

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
the next batch of five is an upstroke

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.080 
the next batch of five is an upstroke
okay

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
okay

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.520 
okay
so<00:04:47.720> four<00:04:48.470> five<00:04:48.710> patterns<00:04:50.020> not<00:04:51.020> a<00:04:51.080> lot<00:04:51.260> of<00:04:51.380> guys

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
so four five patterns not a lot of guys

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.710 
so four five patterns not a lot of guys
have<00:04:52.220> experiences<00:04:52.850> with<00:04:52.940> that<00:04:52.970> so<00:04:53.390> that's<00:04:53.600> why

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
have experiences with that so that's why

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:54.850 
have experiences with that so that's why
I<00:04:53.750> put<00:04:53.930> these<00:04:54.020> videos<00:04:54.320> up<00:04:54.440> here<00:04:54.470> because

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
I put these videos up here because

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.830 
I put these videos up here because
there's<00:04:55.520> there's<00:04:55.880> a<00:04:56.000> whole<00:04:56.210> ton<00:04:56.419> of<00:04:56.450> guys<00:04:56.690> up
