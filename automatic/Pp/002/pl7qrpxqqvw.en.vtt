00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
top 25 poll isn't a big deal I mean you

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.240 
top 25 poll isn't a big deal I mean you
could<00:02:11.760> have<00:02:11.910> Georgia<00:02:12.239> Clemson<00:02:12.630> either<00:02:12.780> way

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
could have Georgia Clemson either way

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.100 
could have Georgia Clemson either way
because<00:02:14.250> I<00:02:14.400> mean<00:02:14.610> they<00:02:15.300> play<00:02:15.569> the<00:02:15.690> first<00:02:15.900> week

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
because I mean they play the first week

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.690 
because I mean they play the first week
so<00:02:16.319> we'll<00:02:16.470> see<00:02:16.620> who<00:02:16.739> the<00:02:16.800> better<00:02:16.950> team<00:02:17.069> is<00:02:17.430> that

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
so we'll see who the better team is that

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.839 
so we'll see who the better team is that
week<00:02:17.959> and<00:02:18.959> then<00:02:19.110> we<00:02:19.200> have<00:02:19.550> Louisville<00:02:20.550> is

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
week and then we have Louisville is

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.940 
week and then we have Louisville is
probably<00:02:21.420> a<00:02:21.510> surprise<00:02:22.050> but<00:02:22.319> I<00:02:22.440> really<00:02:22.769> think

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
probably a surprise but I really think

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.290 
probably a surprise but I really think
reveals<00:02:23.400> a<00:02:23.519> real<00:02:23.670> deal<00:02:23.910> if<00:02:24.060> they<00:02:24.180> go

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
reveals a real deal if they go

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.520 
reveals a real deal if they go
undefeated<00:02:24.569> I<00:02:24.900> think<00:02:25.080> they<00:02:25.170> have<00:02:25.319> a<00:02:25.349> great

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
undefeated I think they have a great

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:26.720 
undefeated I think they have a great
chance<00:02:25.890> to<00:02:26.069> play<00:02:26.220> for<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.400> national

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
chance to play for the national

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:27.830 
chance to play for the national
championship<00:02:26.760> and<00:02:27.239> they're<00:02:27.360> just<00:02:27.480> as<00:02:27.599> good<00:02:27.660> as

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
championship and they're just as good as

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.809 
championship and they're just as good as
any<00:02:28.080> other<00:02:28.140> team<00:02:28.440> in<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.620> country<00:02:28.819> because

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
any other team in the country because

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.280 
any other team in the country because
Teddy<00:02:30.090> Bridgewater<00:02:30.599> I<00:02:30.720> believe<00:02:30.959> it's<00:02:31.110> one<00:02:31.170> of

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
Teddy Bridgewater I believe it's one of

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.270 
Teddy Bridgewater I believe it's one of
the<00:02:31.349> best<00:02:31.470> quarterback<00:02:31.920> we've<00:02:32.160> seen<00:02:32.430> since

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
the best quarterback we've seen since

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.009 
the best quarterback we've seen since
he's<00:02:35.280> right<00:02:35.549> up<00:02:35.700> there<00:02:35.730> with<00:02:36.269> Andrew<00:02:36.630> Luck<00:02:36.840> i

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
he's right up there with Andrew Luck i

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.080 
he's right up there with Andrew Luck i
really<00:02:37.319> believe<00:02:37.560> so<00:02:37.590> but<00:02:38.220> not<00:02:38.700> going<00:02:38.819> to<00:02:38.880> keep

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
really believe so but not going to keep
