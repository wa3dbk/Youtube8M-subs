are they getting miles out of this and
not<00:00:33.840> just<00:00:33.899> a<00:00:34.170> couple<00:00:34.410> of<00:00:34.590> minutes<00:00:34.950> before<00:00:35.100> they

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
not just a couple of minutes before they

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.360 
not just a couple of minutes before they
get<00:00:35.520> injured<00:00:36.380> so<00:00:37.380> if<00:00:37.649> you're<00:00:37.829> used<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.160> running

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
get injured so if you're used to running

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.910 
get injured so if you're used to running
with<00:00:38.670> shoes<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.629> little<00:00:39.840> bit<00:00:40.079> of<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.290> history

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
with shoes a little bit of a history

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.600 
with shoes a little bit of a history
here<00:00:41.180> then<00:00:42.180> you're<00:00:42.600> taught<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:43.440> land<00:00:43.770> on<00:00:44.100> your

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
here then you're taught to land on your

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.029 
here then you're taught to land on your
heel<00:00:45.030> so<00:00:45.539> your<00:00:45.750> heel<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.110> taking<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.559> lot<00:00:46.800> of<00:00:46.860> the

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
heel so your heel is taking a lot of the

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.680 
heel so your heel is taking a lot of the
impact<00:00:47.399> which<00:00:47.579> is<00:00:47.610> why<00:00:47.879> those<00:00:48.120> running<00:00:48.450> shoes

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
impact which is why those running shoes

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.900 
impact which is why those running shoes
have<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.989> very<00:00:49.410> padded<00:00:50.010> heel<00:00:50.370> because<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.700> heel

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
have a very padded heel because the heel

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.310 
have a very padded heel because the heel
is<00:00:50.940> getting<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.390> brunt<00:00:51.629> of<00:00:51.719> your<00:00:51.780> run<00:00:52.079> and

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
is getting the brunt of your run and

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.500 
is getting the brunt of your run and
you're<00:00:52.440> also<00:00:52.649> taught<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.489> have<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.730> very<00:00:54.180> long

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
you're also taught to have a very long

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.040 
you're also taught to have a very long
stride<00:00:55.430> to<00:00:56.430> pick<00:00:56.640> up<00:00:56.789> speed<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.149> lot<00:00:57.420> faster<00:00:57.899> and

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
stride to pick up speed a lot faster and

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.020 
stride to pick up speed a lot faster and
and<00:00:58.230> especially<00:00:59.160> with<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.309> longer<00:00:59.760> stride

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
and especially with a longer stride

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.930 
and especially with a longer stride
you're<00:01:00.239> gonna<00:01:00.359> get<00:01:00.539> much<00:01:00.840> more<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.289> an<00:01:01.410> impact

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
you're gonna get much more of an impact

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.700 
you're gonna get much more of an impact
focused<00:01:02.940> on<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.239> heel<00:01:03.480> itself<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.229> then<00:01:04.559> that

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
focused on the heel itself and then that

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.740 
focused on the heel itself and then that
travels<00:01:05.189> up<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.489> it<00:01:05.640> hurts<00:01:05.820> your<00:01:06.000> knees<00:01:06.299> hurts

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
travels up and it hurts your knees hurts

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:07.910 
travels up and it hurts your knees hurts
your<00:01:06.900> back<00:01:07.080> anyway

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
your back anyway

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.310 
your back anyway
if<00:01:08.549> you've<00:01:08.880> been<00:01:09.090> running<00:01:09.720> for<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.869> long<00:01:09.930> time

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
if you've been running for a long time

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.840 
if you've been running for a long time
in<00:01:10.439> shoes<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:10.920> know<00:01:11.100> about<00:01:11.400> some<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.729> the

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
in shoes you know about some of the

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.570 
in shoes you know about some of the
soreness<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.600> comes<00:01:12.810> with<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.260> and

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
soreness that comes with it and

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.460 
soreness that comes with it and
especially<00:01:14.580> in<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.180> joints<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:15.869> it<00:01:16.020> made<00:01:16.229> me

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
especially in the joints and it made me

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.640 
especially in the joints and it made me
wonder<00:01:17.000> how<00:01:18.000> long<00:01:18.060> my<00:01:18.540> joints<00:01:18.930> would<00:01:19.049> last<00:01:19.320> or

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
wonder how long my joints would last or

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.380 
wonder how long my joints would last or
if<00:01:19.740> my<00:01:19.920> knees<00:01:20.340> would<00:01:20.549> eventually<00:01:20.820> wear<00:01:21.330> down

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
if my knees would eventually wear down

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.630 
if my knees would eventually wear down
from<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.080> impact<00:01:22.500> of<00:01:22.650> running<00:01:22.920> in<00:01:23.310> shoes

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
from the impact of running in shoes

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.350 
from the impact of running in shoes
until<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:24.509> found<00:01:24.750> barefoot<00:01:25.320> running<00:01:25.530> so

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
until I found barefoot running so

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.330 
until I found barefoot running so
there's<00:01:27.360> three<00:01:27.780> little<00:01:27.960> things<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.799> keep<00:01:29.130> in

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
there's three little things to keep in

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.090 
there's three little things to keep in
mind<00:01:29.369> when<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:30.479> are<00:01:30.509> running<00:01:31.409> barefoot<00:01:31.680> when

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
mind when you are running barefoot when

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.030 
mind when you are running barefoot when
it<00:01:32.220> comes<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.549> your<00:01:32.640> stride<00:01:33.290> first<00:01:34.290> focus<00:01:34.860> on

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
it comes to your stride first focus on

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.240 
it comes to your stride first focus on
lifting<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:35.909> knee<00:01:36.210> so<00:01:37.020> instead<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.409> kicking

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
lifting the knee so instead of kicking

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.580 
lifting the knee so instead of kicking
your<00:01:38.369> feet<00:01:38.400> behind<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:39.150> it's<00:01:39.360> more<00:01:39.720> lifting

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
your feet behind you it's more lifting

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.810 
your feet behind you it's more lifting
your<00:01:40.710> knee<00:01:40.829> in<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.009> front<00:01:41.040> so<00:01:41.400> you<00:01:41.430> can<00:01:41.640> get<00:01:41.790> a

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
your knee in the front so you can get a

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.780 
your knee in the front so you can get a
really<00:01:42.119> good<00:01:42.409> land<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.710> now<00:01:44.220> when<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.640> comes

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
really good land and now when it comes

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.980 
really good land and now when it comes

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
landing on that heel so you're gonna

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.530

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
is possible but it will slow you down a

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.610
