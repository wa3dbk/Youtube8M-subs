to the computer i know it's a pain in
the<00:01:02.190> butt<00:01:02.399> but<00:01:04.010> it's<00:01:05.010> so<00:01:05.250> much<00:01:05.309> better<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.760> have

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
the butt but it's so much better to have

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.690 
the butt but it's so much better to have
an<00:01:06.360> app<00:01:06.510> that<00:01:06.540> runs<00:01:06.900> then<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.740> have<00:01:08.369> an<00:01:08.580> app

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
an app that runs then to have an app

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.810 
an app that runs then to have an app
that<00:01:08.729> just<00:01:08.909> crashes<00:01:09.630> so<00:01:10.260> i<00:01:10.290> do<00:01:11.100> it<00:01:11.189> over<00:01:11.369> 3g

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
that just crashes so i do it over 3g

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.700 
that just crashes so i do it over 3g
alright<00:01:13.369> if<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:15.119> if<00:01:15.840> it's<00:01:16.170> over<00:01:16.470> three

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
alright if you if it's over three

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.080 
alright if you if it's over three
megabytes<00:01:17.540> and<00:01:18.540> do<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:18.840> over<00:01:18.930> Wi-Fi<00:01:19.520> Wi-Fi<00:01:20.520> is

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
megabytes and do it over Wi-Fi Wi-Fi is

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.420 
megabytes and do it over Wi-Fi Wi-Fi is
pretty<00:01:21.840> dang<00:01:22.200> good<00:01:22.229> one<00:01:22.710> thing<00:01:22.950> about<00:01:23.159> Wi-Fi

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
pretty dang good one thing about Wi-Fi

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.550 
pretty dang good one thing about Wi-Fi
is<00:01:23.909> make<00:01:24.570> sure<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:24.930> have<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.140> really<00:01:25.439> strong

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
is make sure you have a really strong

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.060 
is make sure you have a really strong
signal<00:01:26.369> if<00:01:27.290> personally<00:01:28.290> i<00:01:28.320> think<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.770> best

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
signal if personally i think the best

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.859 
signal if personally i think the best
way<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.369> get<00:01:29.579> in<00:01:29.729> that<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:30.240> best<00:01:30.509> glitch

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
way to get in that the best glitch

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.609 
way to get in that the best glitch
freeway<00:01:31.380> is<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:32.310> do<00:01:32.430> it<00:01:33.439> through<00:01:34.439> Wi-Fi

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
freeway is to do it through Wi-Fi

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.649 
freeway is to do it through Wi-Fi
through<00:01:35.400> your<00:01:35.610> phone<00:01:35.850> with<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.360> really

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
through your phone with the really

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.359 
through your phone with the really
strong<00:01:36.869> signal<00:01:37.320> if<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.710> have<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.890> weak<00:01:38.070> signal

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
strong signal if you have a weak signal

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.710 
strong signal if you have a weak signal
some<00:01:38.790> packets<00:01:39.180> aren't<00:01:39.360> going<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.540> make<00:01:39.659> it

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
some packets aren't going to make it

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.109 
some packets aren't going to make it
there<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.140> it'll<00:01:40.320> probably<00:01:40.560> get<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.340> after

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
there and it'll probably get you after

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.499 
there and it'll probably get you after
you<00:01:42.780> downloaded<00:01:43.200> your<00:01:43.409> app<00:01:44.210> absolutely<00:01:45.210> one

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
you downloaded your app absolutely one

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.450 
you downloaded your app absolutely one
hundred<00:01:45.540> percent<00:01:45.990> sure<00:01:46.470> make<00:01:46.979> sure<00:01:47.280> you

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
hundred percent sure make sure you

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.300 
hundred percent sure make sure you
restart<00:01:48.180> or<00:01:48.420> reboot<00:01:49.049> your<00:01:49.290> iPhone<00:01:49.710> okay<00:01:50.250> so

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
restart or reboot your iPhone okay so

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.539 
restart or reboot your iPhone okay so
turn<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:50.700> off<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.149> then<00:01:51.180> turn<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.450> back<00:01:51.540> on

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
turn it off and then turn it back on

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:55.340 
turn it off and then turn it back on
this<00:01:53.549> is<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.880> main<00:01:54.210> reason<00:01:54.750> people<00:01:54.780> have

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
this is the main reason people have

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.200 
this is the main reason people have
problems<00:01:55.680> I<00:01:56.009> don't<00:01:56.219> know<00:01:56.280> why<00:01:56.490> but<00:01:56.520> you<00:01:57.000> have

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
problems I don't know why but you have

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.969 
problems I don't know why but you have
to<00:01:57.420> review<00:01:57.719> kind<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.110> like<00:01:58.229> a<00:01:58.259> computer<00:01:58.680> when

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
to review kind of like a computer when

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.310 
to review kind of like a computer when
you<00:01:59.100> install<00:01:59.490> new<00:01:59.790> software<00:01:59.820> on<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:00.450> it<00:02:00.990> runs

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
you install new software on it it runs

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.950 
you install new software on it it runs
so<00:02:01.770> much<00:02:02.040> smoother<00:02:02.460> if<00:02:02.549> you<00:02:02.579> just<00:02:02.700> reboot<00:02:03.240> so

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
so much smoother if you just reboot so

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.350 
so much smoother if you just reboot so
that's<00:02:04.500> easy<00:02:04.799> that's<00:02:05.310> not<00:02:05.909> hard<00:02:06.119> at<00:02:06.270> all

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
that's easy that's not hard at all

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.469 
that's easy that's not hard at all
remember<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.110> do<00:02:07.259> that<00:02:07.290> one<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:08.270> third<00:02:09.270> of<00:02:09.360> all

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
remember to do that one a third of all

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.270 
remember to do that one a third of all
if<00:02:09.810> you're<00:02:10.140> playing<00:02:10.349> a<00:02:10.560> game<00:02:10.739> or<00:02:10.950> something

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
if you're playing a game or something

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.280 
if you're playing a game or something
and<00:02:11.400> you're<00:02:11.520> having<00:02:11.730> glitches<00:02:12.330> reboot<00:02:12.959> all

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
and you're having glitches reboot all

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.960 
and you're having glitches reboot all
right

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
right

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.369 
right
usually<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.209> glitches<00:02:15.450> are<00:02:15.750> resolved<00:02:16.230> and

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
usually the glitches are resolved and

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:17.449 
usually the glitches are resolved and
that's<00:02:16.500> usually<00:02:16.739> because<00:02:16.950> you're<00:02:17.250> doing

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
that's usually because you're doing

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:18.830 
that's usually because you're doing
something<00:02:17.700> else<00:02:17.940> at<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.209> same<00:02:18.390> time<00:02:18.629> like

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
something else at the same time like

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.110 
something else at the same time like
retrieving<00:02:19.440> email<00:02:19.920> and<00:02:20.190> doing<00:02:20.700> all<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:20.910> stuff

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
retrieving email and doing all the stuff

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.960 
retrieving email and doing all the stuff
that<00:02:21.180> also<00:02:21.599> requires<00:02:21.750> a<00:02:22.730> processing<00:02:23.730> power

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
that also requires a processing power

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.320 
that also requires a processing power
and<00:02:24.150> your<00:02:24.720> iPhone<00:02:25.140> or<00:02:25.550> iPod<00:02:26.550> Touch<00:02:26.760> just<00:02:27.150> can't

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
and your iPhone or iPod Touch just can't

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.600 
and your iPhone or iPod Touch just can't
handle<00:02:27.690> it<00:02:27.870> so<00:02:28.379> I<00:02:28.410> give<00:02:28.860> it<00:02:28.950> a<00:02:28.980> break<00:02:29.099> let<00:02:29.489> it

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
handle it so I give it a break let it

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.080 
handle it so I give it a break let it
restart<00:02:29.790> and<00:02:30.319> that's<00:02:31.319> that<00:02:31.650> one<00:02:32.549> last<00:02:32.819> thing

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
restart and that's that one last thing

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.880 
restart and that's that one last thing
