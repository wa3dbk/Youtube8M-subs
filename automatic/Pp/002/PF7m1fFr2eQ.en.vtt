voicing their concerns at all so this

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.310 
voicing their concerns at all so this

Authority schools are under also another
important<00:02:11.720> agent<00:02:12.080> of<00:02:12.170> socialization<00:02:12.700> so<00:02:13.700> in

important agent of socialization so in

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:14.690 
important agent of socialization so in
addition<00:02:14.209> to<00:02:14.300> teaching

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
addition to teaching

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.699 
addition to teaching
about<00:02:14.879> different<00:02:15.300> subjects<00:02:15.930> like<00:02:16.140> science

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
about different subjects like science

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.979 
about different subjects like science
and<00:02:16.830> math<00:02:16.950> or<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:17.700> standard<00:02:18.270> reading<00:02:18.510> writing

and math or the standard reading writing

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.559

and arithmetic schools teach life skills

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.920 
and arithmetic schools teach life skills
so<00:02:22.470> students<00:02:23.069> do<00:02:23.190> not<00:02:23.340> just<00:02:23.580> learn<00:02:24.000> from<00:02:24.420> their

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
so students do not just learn from their

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.720 
so students do not just learn from their
academic<00:02:25.590> curriculum<00:02:26.129> but<00:02:26.280> they<00:02:26.430> learn

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
academic curriculum but they learn

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.759 
academic curriculum but they learn
social<00:02:27.450> skills<00:02:27.720> from<00:02:27.930> interactions<00:02:28.560> with

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
teachers and other students for example

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.500 
teachers and other students for example
we<00:02:32.069> learn<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.489> importance<00:02:32.970> of<00:02:33.120> obeying

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
we learn the importance of obeying

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.650 
we learn the importance of obeying
Authority<00:02:33.810> and<00:02:34.670> that<00:02:35.670> to<00:02:35.849> be<00:02:35.970> successful<00:02:36.510> we

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
Authority and that to be successful we

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.449 
Authority and that to be successful we
must<00:02:36.780> learn<00:02:36.989> to<00:02:37.050> be<00:02:37.260> quiet<00:02:37.530> we<00:02:38.010> must<00:02:38.220> learn<00:02:38.400> to

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
must learn to be quiet we must learn to

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.360 
must learn to be quiet we must learn to
wait<00:02:38.970> and<00:02:39.239> to<00:02:39.720> even<00:02:40.110> act<00:02:40.349> interested<00:02:40.799> when<00:02:41.250> we

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
wait and to even act interested when we

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.089 
wait and to even act interested when we
are<00:02:41.459> not<00:02:41.610> interested<00:02:42.030> at<00:02:42.150> all<00:02:42.299> so<00:02:43.080> this<00:02:43.769> is

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
are not interested at all so this is

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:45.860 
are not interested at all so this is
part<00:02:44.519> of<00:02:44.610> what<00:02:44.790> is<00:02:44.910> called<00:02:45.239> the<00:02:45.390> hidden

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
part of what is called the hidden

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.660 
part of what is called the hidden
curriculum<00:02:46.080> which<00:02:46.650> is<00:02:46.680> just<00:02:47.130> standard

curriculum which is just standard

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.820 
curriculum which is just standard
behaviors<00:02:48.360> and<00:02:48.599> they<00:02:48.989> are<00:02:49.049> really<00:02:49.440> what<00:02:49.709> is

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830

behaviors and they are really what is
deemed<00:02:50.130> acceptable<00:02:50.610> and<00:02:51.000> they<00:02:51.060> are<00:02:51.150> subtly

taught<00:02:52.049> by<00:02:52.290> teachers<00:02:53.150> peers<00:02:54.150> helped<00:02:54.630> us

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
taught by teachers peers helped us

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.199 
taught by teachers peers helped us

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.360 
and behavior they contradict the values
of<00:03:02.670> our<00:03:02.760> families<00:03:03.360> so<00:03:03.930> it's<00:03:04.079> really<00:03:04.590> up<00:03:04.920> to<00:03:04.950> you

and which to get rid of so peer pressure
is<00:03:10.530> an<00:03:10.650> example<00:03:10.980> of<00:03:11.160> how<00:03:11.310> peers<00:03:11.700> influence<00:03:12.329> us

our teenage years also influence what

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.949 
our teenage years also influence what
movies<00:03:20.639> we<00:03:20.790> watch<00:03:21.030> or<00:03:21.209> even<00:03:21.269> the<00:03:21.480> music<00:03:21.720> we

listen to
mass<00:03:23.819> media<00:03:24.180> includes<00:03:24.840> things<00:03:25.049> like

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
mass media includes things like

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.069 
mass media includes things like
television<00:03:26.040> internet<00:03:26.579> radio<00:03:26.970> movies<00:03:27.540> books

television internet radio movies books
and<00:03:28.260> magazines<00:03:29.130> so<00:03:29.819> when<00:03:30.030> children<00:03:30.239> are<00:03:30.510> young

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
and magazines so when children are young

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.900 
and magazines so when children are young
they<00:03:31.440> learn<00:03:31.769> things<00:03:32.100> through<00:03:32.340> mass<00:03:32.489> media

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
they learn things through mass media

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.970 
they learn things through mass media
that<00:03:33.120> their<00:03:33.690> parents<00:03:34.139> really<00:03:34.500> they<00:03:34.650> would<00:03:34.829> not

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
that their parents really they would not

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.800 
that their parents really they would not
even<00:03:35.100> approve<00:03:35.519> of<00:03:35.670> so<00:03:35.850> today<00:03:36.209> children<00:03:36.600> are

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
even approve of so today children are

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.840 
even approve of so today children are
exposed<00:03:37.139> to<00:03:37.290> a<00:03:37.380> lot<00:03:37.799> of<00:03:38.040> content<00:03:38.579> that<00:03:38.760> is

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
exposed to a lot of content that is

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.150 
exposed to a lot of content that is
intended<00:03:39.329> for<00:03:39.359> mature<00:03:39.540> audiences<00:03:40.160> like

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
intended for mature audiences like

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.099 
intended for mature audiences like
violent<00:03:41.639> TV<00:03:41.970> shows<00:03:42.209> for<00:03:42.480> example

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
violent TV shows for example

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:45.530 
violent TV shows for example
so<00:03:43.620> sometimes<00:03:43.980> mass<00:03:44.220> media<00:03:44.609> even<00:03:44.790> enforces

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
so sometimes mass media even enforces

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.750 
so sometimes mass media even enforces
gender<00:03:46.109> and<00:03:46.290> other<00:03:46.500> stereotypes<00:03:46.980> so<00:03:47.609> one

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
gender and other stereotypes so one

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.610 
gender and other stereotypes so one
great<00:03:48.000> example<00:03:48.480> of<00:03:48.540> how<00:03:48.600> mass<00:03:48.900> media<00:03:49.350> is<00:03:49.470> an

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
great example of how mass media is an

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.009 
great example of how mass media is an
agent<00:03:50.069> of<00:03:50.160> socialization<00:03:50.609> is<00:03:51.389> children's

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
agent of socialization is children's

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.289 
agent of socialization is children's
books<00:03:52.319> so<00:03:52.980> I<00:03:53.010> remember<00:03:53.430> reading<00:03:53.609> one<00:03:54.000> called

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
books so I remember reading one called
