more in ways that I don't think we've

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.539 
more in ways that I don't think we've
been<00:01:42.180> able<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.750> do<00:01:43.290> before<00:01:43.649> or<00:01:43.860> at<00:01:43.920> least<00:01:44.040> you

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
know because you listen to a concept

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.210 
know because you listen to a concept
album<00:01:45.960> there's<00:01:46.350> obviously<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.710> story<00:01:46.979> there

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
album there's obviously a story there

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.469 
album there's obviously a story there
and<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.369> feel<00:01:47.520> very<00:01:47.549> proud<00:01:47.939> of<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.090> last<00:01:48.270> record

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
and I feel very proud of the last record

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.109 
and I feel very proud of the last record
but<00:01:48.720> in<00:01:48.840> some<00:01:49.049> ways<00:01:49.579> once<00:01:50.579> you're<00:01:50.790> removed

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
but in some ways once you're removed

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.700 
but in some ways once you're removed
from<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.360> story<00:01:51.630> it's<00:01:52.049> hard<00:01:52.320> for<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:52.680> to

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
from the story it's hard for it to

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.620 
from the story it's hard for it to
resonate<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.369> you<00:01:53.430> emotionally<00:01:54.060> whereas<00:01:54.509> this

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
resonate to you emotionally whereas this

record<00:01:54.899> I<00:01:54.960> really<00:01:55.200> do<00:01:55.290> feel<00:01:55.470> like<00:01:55.619> there<00:01:55.770> was<00:01:55.829> a

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
record I really do feel like there was a

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.649 
record I really do feel like there was a
strong<00:01:56.189> connection<00:01:56.430> amongst<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.329> music

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
strong connection amongst the the music

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:58.760 
strong connection amongst the the music
and<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.840> lyrics<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.259> everything<00:01:58.590> kind<00:01:58.740> of

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
and the lyrics and everything kind of

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.080 
and the lyrics and everything kind of
coming<00:01:59.009> together<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.460> call<00:01:59.610> us<00:01:59.759> and<00:01:59.969> I<00:02:00.030> think
