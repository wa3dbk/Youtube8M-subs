that's<00:00:16.590> a<00:00:16.680> really<00:00:16.890> good<00:00:17.010> place<00:00:17.220> to<00:00:17.400> buy

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.230 
that's a really good place to buy

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.410 
that's a really good place to buy
Chessie's<00:00:19.230> because<00:00:19.650> they're<00:00:20.070> really<00:00:20.550> cheap<00:00:20.730> a

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
Chessie's because they're really cheap a

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.210 
Chessie's because they're really cheap a
lot<00:00:21.870> of<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.050> RC<00:00:22.320> cars<00:00:22.560> there<00:00:22.800> don't<00:00:23.010> have

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
lot of the RC cars there don't have

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.580 
lot of the RC cars there don't have
robot<00:00:23.760> controls<00:00:24.120> so<00:00:24.660> you<00:00:24.690> won't<00:00:25.260> be<00:00:25.350> able<00:00:25.440> to

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
robot controls so you won't be able to

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.310 
robot controls so you won't be able to
do<00:00:26.040> any<00:00:26.190> sort<00:00:26.310> of<00:00:26.430> remoting<00:00:26.820> from<00:00:26.970> with<00:00:27.360> it<00:00:27.540> but

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
do any sort of remoting from with it but

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.680 
do any sort of remoting from with it but
you<00:00:28.590> can<00:00:28.890> strip<00:00:29.610> off<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:30.000> body<00:00:30.180> and<00:00:30.420> put<00:00:30.660> a

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:30.690 
you can strip off the body and put a

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.029 
you can strip off the body and put a
robot<00:00:30.990> on<00:00:31.140> it<00:00:31.260> or<00:00:31.429> robot<00:00:32.429> robot<00:00:33.420> controller

this<00:00:35.039> right<00:00:35.190> here<00:00:35.370> is<00:00:35.399> a<00:00:35.460> arduino<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:37.940> here's

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
this right here is a arduino and here's

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.329 
this right here is a arduino and here's
the<00:00:39.269> eyes<00:00:39.660> i<00:00:40.170> have<00:00:40.530> three<00:00:40.800> eyes<00:00:40.949> on<00:00:41.219> this

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:41.339 
the eyes i have three eyes on this

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:45.430 
the eyes i have three eyes on this
they're<00:00:42.120> ultrasonic<00:00:43.519> parallax<00:00:44.519> ping

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
they're ultrasonic parallax ping

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.160 
they're ultrasonic parallax ping
ultrasonic<00:00:46.440> sensors<00:00:47.690> what<00:00:48.690> they<00:00:48.780> do<00:00:48.839> is<00:00:49.019> they

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
ultrasonic sensors what they do is they

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.759 
ultrasonic sensors what they do is they
tell<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.409> distance<00:00:49.980> in<00:00:50.339> inches<00:00:50.999> or<00:00:51.300> centimeters

00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:51.769 
tell a distance in inches or centimeters

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:54.829 
tell a distance in inches or centimeters
about<00:00:52.769> how<00:00:52.949> far<00:00:53.399> something<00:00:53.670> is<00:00:53.879> away<00:00:54.629> from<00:00:54.690> the

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:54.839 
about how far something is away from the

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:58.340 
about how far something is away from the
eye<00:00:54.960> I<00:00:55.230> believe<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.309> goes<00:00:56.429> around<00:00:56.609> 100<00:00:57.350> inches

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
eye I believe it goes around 100 inches

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.239 
eye I believe it goes around 100 inches
so<00:00:58.999> that's<00:00:59.999> what<00:01:00.149> I<00:01:00.179> can<00:01:00.359> get<00:01:00.479> out<00:01:00.539> of<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:01.249> all

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:02.249 
so that's what I can get out of it all

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:03.799 
so that's what I can get out of it all
right<00:01:02.339> there's<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.729> motor<00:01:02.969> controller<00:01:03.329> this

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
right there's the motor controller this

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.410 
right there's the motor controller this
is<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.880> palolo<00:01:05.880> quick<00:01:06.420> 2s9<00:01:07.050> v1<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:08.420> its

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
is the palolo quick 2s9 v1 and its

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.720 
is the palolo quick 2s9 v1 and its
really<00:01:09.600> good<00:01:09.810> motor<00:01:09.990> controller<00:01:10.350> as<00:01:10.590> one<00:01:11.520> amp

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:11.730 
really good motor controller as one amp

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.440 
really good motor controller as one amp
standard<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.540> three<00:01:12.990> at<00:01:13.080> max<00:01:13.410> output<00:01:14.190> so<00:01:15.090> it's

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
standard and three at max output so it's

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.000 
standard and three at max output so it's
plenty<00:01:15.840> enough<00:01:16.050> to<00:01:16.230> run<00:01:16.490> the<00:01:17.490> rear<00:01:18.060> motor<00:01:18.270> and

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
plenty enough to run the rear motor and

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.270 
plenty enough to run the rear motor and
also<00:01:20.010> the<00:01:20.160> front<00:01:20.430> turn<00:01:21.060> motor<00:01:21.300> a<00:01:22.290> one<00:01:22.860> bad<00:01:23.040> part

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
also the front turn motor a one bad part

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.610 
also the front turn motor a one bad part
about<00:01:23.310> this<00:01:23.520> chassis<00:01:23.970> is<00:01:24.230> it<00:01:25.230> doesn't<00:01:25.500> have<00:01:25.590> a

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:25.620 
about this chassis is it doesn't have a

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.890 
about this chassis is it doesn't have a
very<00:01:25.860> good<00:01:25.980> turn<00:01:26.190> radius<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:27.090> guess<00:01:27.570> Hummers

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
very good turn radius I guess Hummers

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.970 
very good turn radius I guess Hummers
don't<00:01:28.110> have<00:01:28.290> good<00:01:28.500> turn<00:01:28.710> radiuses<00:01:30.230> so<00:01:31.230> I<00:01:31.530> have

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:31.980 
don't have good turn radiuses so I have

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.860 
don't have good turn radiuses so I have
a<00:01:32.040> 9-volt<00:01:32.520> battery<00:01:32.850> underneath<00:01:33.690> here<00:01:34.590> and

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:35.870 
a 9-volt battery underneath here and

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.810 
a 9-volt battery underneath here and
that<00:01:36.870> manual<00:01:37.200> battery<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.620> connected<00:01:37.800> to<00:01:38.190> the

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
that manual battery is connected to the

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.100 
that manual battery is connected to the
Arduino<00:01:39.780> using<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.830> cord<00:01:41.630> universal<00:01:42.630> cord<00:01:42.960> that

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
Arduino using a cord universal cord that

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.190 
Arduino using a cord universal cord that
i<00:01:43.140> got<00:01:43.290> from<00:01:43.440> radio<00:01:43.770> shack<00:01:47.810> now<00:01:48.810> these<00:01:48.930> eyes

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
i got from radio shack now these eyes

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.410 
i got from radio shack now these eyes
are<00:01:49.530> about<00:01:49.740> thirty<00:01:50.070> dollars<00:01:50.400> a<00:01:50.430> piece<00:01:50.670> they're

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
are about thirty dollars a piece they're

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.060 
are about thirty dollars a piece they're
a<00:01:51.450> little<00:01:51.570> bit<00:01:51.750> expensive<00:01:52.200> I've<00:01:52.680> complained

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
a little bit expensive I've complained

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.410 
a little bit expensive I've complained
of<00:01:53.130> radio<00:01:53.340> shack<00:01:53.400> about<00:01:53.760> that<00:01:53.910> but<00:01:54.060> they<00:01:54.210> won't

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
of radio shack about that but they won't

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.320 
of radio shack about that but they won't
do<00:01:54.510> anything<00:01:55.280> the<00:01:56.480> pololu<00:01:58.940> motor<00:01:59.940> controller

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
do anything the pololu motor controller

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.570 
do anything the pololu motor controller
there<00:02:00.570> is<00:02:00.900> about<00:02:01.800> twenty-five<00:02:02.340> dollars<00:02:03.260> and

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
there is about twenty-five dollars and

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.790 
there is about twenty-five dollars and
the<00:02:05.580> arduino<00:02:06.210> there's<00:02:06.420> about<00:02:06.720> twenty<00:02:07.530> dollars

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
the arduino there's about twenty dollars

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.470 
the arduino there's about twenty dollars
or<00:02:07.950> so<00:02:08.099> i<00:02:08.369> think<00:02:08.729> it's<00:02:08.939> 1995<00:02:09.599> I<00:02:11.269> don't<00:02:12.269> want<00:02:12.420> to

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
or so i think it's 1995 I don't want to

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.440 
or so i think it's 1995 I don't want to
get<00:02:12.569> that<00:02:12.659> wrong

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
get that wrong

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:24.570 
get that wrong
I<00:02:14.349> don't<00:02:14.620> know<00:02:17.069> so<00:02:18.069> here<00:02:18.280> we<00:02:18.340> go<00:02:23.519> now<00:02:24.519> you

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
I don't know so here we go now you

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.830 
I don't know so here we go now you
notice<00:02:24.760> it<00:02:26.819> it<00:02:27.819> kind<00:02:28.030> of<00:02:28.060> runs<00:02:28.300> into<00:02:28.629> things

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
notice it it kind of runs into things

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.690 
notice it it kind of runs into things
sometimes<00:02:31.530> well<00:02:32.530> that's<00:02:32.680> okay<00:02:32.950> it's<00:02:33.130> got<00:02:33.459> its

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
sometimes well that's okay it's got its

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:41.440 
sometimes well that's okay it's got its
got<00:02:33.819> a<00:02:33.880> pumper<00:02:34.180> honey

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.520 

it's<00:02:42.450> not<00:02:42.630> exactly<00:02:42.960> the<00:02:43.080> most<00:02:43.170> elegant<00:02:43.530> robot

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
it's not exactly the most elegant robot

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.360 
it's not exactly the most elegant robot
it<00:02:46.530> has<00:02:46.680> to<00:02:46.770> be<00:02:46.860> a<00:02:46.890> little<00:02:47.070> bit<00:02:47.190> with<00:02:47.310> the

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
it has to be a little bit with the

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.310 
it has to be a little bit with the
programming<00:02:47.910> it's<00:02:48.600> kind<00:02:48.780> of<00:02:48.870> fighting<00:02:49.140> with

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
programming it's kind of fighting with

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.850 
programming it's kind of fighting with
itself<00:02:50.420> because<00:02:51.420> I'm<00:02:51.600> trying<00:02:52.500> to<00:02:52.590> determine

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
itself because I'm trying to determine

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.560 
itself because I'm trying to determine
if<00:02:53.100> it's<00:02:53.250> gone<00:02:53.610> anywhere<00:02:53.940> since<00:02:54.300> the<00:02:54.420> last

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
if it's gone anywhere since the last

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.600 
if it's gone anywhere since the last
time<00:02:54.750> I<00:02:54.810> ran<00:02:57.590> so<00:02:58.590> you'll<00:02:58.710> notice<00:02:58.830> it's<00:02:59.100> it's

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
time I ran so you'll notice it's it's

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.110 
time I ran so you'll notice it's it's
stopping<00:02:59.970> in<00:03:00.450> minutes<00:03:00.860> continuing<00:03:01.860> on<00:03:02.120> after

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
stopping in minutes continuing on after

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.420 
stopping in minutes continuing on after
about<00:03:03.240> a<00:03:03.300> second<00:03:03.600> or<00:03:03.660> so<00:03:03.720> I'm<00:03:04.170> is<00:03:04.920> doing<00:03:05.100> a<00:03:05.190> full

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
about a second or so I'm is doing a full

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.130 
about a second or so I'm is doing a full
reverse<00:03:05.790> and<00:03:06.330> then<00:03:06.450> it's<00:03:06.570> doing<00:03:06.780> some<00:03:06.960> short

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
reverse and then it's doing some short

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.970 
reverse and then it's doing some short
reverses<00:03:07.890> and<00:03:08.330> doing<00:03:09.330> some<00:03:09.480> turns<00:03:09.860> that<00:03:10.860> has

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
reverses and doing some turns that has

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.500 
reverses and doing some turns that has
to<00:03:11.100> do<00:03:11.190> with<00:03:11.340> you<00:03:11.550> know<00:03:11.670> how<00:03:11.820> far<00:03:12.090> something<00:03:12.390> is

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
to do with you know how far something is

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.110 
to do with you know how far something is
on<00:03:12.690> the<00:03:12.810> side<00:03:12.990> and<00:03:13.050> how<00:03:13.500> far<00:03:13.740> something<00:03:14.070> is<00:03:14.880> in

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
on the side and how far something is in

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.050 
on the side and how far something is in
front<00:03:15.360> of<00:03:15.450> there<00:03:16.460> so<00:03:17.460> it's<00:03:17.580> really<00:03:17.700> just<00:03:17.820> a

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
front of there so it's really just a

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:46.810 
front of there so it's really just a
programming<00:03:18.540> that's<00:03:18.630> fighting<00:03:18.960> with<00:03:19.200> itself

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.580 

and<00:03:47.820> here<00:03:48.000> I'll<00:03:48.120> back<00:03:48.270> up<00:03:48.300> pretty<00:03:48.990> soon<00:03:49.170> or

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
and here I'll back up pretty soon or

00:03:49.590 --> 00:04:22.230 
and here I'll back up pretty soon or
should

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.659 

I<00:04:22.330> think<00:04:23.139> what's<00:04:23.319> going<00:04:23.530> on<00:04:23.710> here<00:04:24.039> is<00:04:24.160> it's<00:04:24.460> got

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:24.669 
I think what's going on here is it's got

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:28.800 
I think what's going on here is it's got
a<00:04:24.900> infinite<00:04:26.580> infinite<00:04:27.580> distance<00:04:28.330> protector

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
a infinite infinite distance protector

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.670 
a infinite infinite distance protector
on<00:04:28.930> it<00:04:29.340> so<00:04:30.340> if<00:04:30.940> the<00:04:31.539> front<00:04:31.780> I<00:04:31.990> can't<00:04:32.470> see

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
on it so if the front I can't see

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.120 
on it so if the front I can't see
something<00:04:33.509> far<00:04:34.509> away<00:04:34.660> for<00:04:34.720> me<00:04:34.900> and<00:04:35.770> I'll<00:04:35.979> sit

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
something far away for me and I'll sit

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:44.249 
something far away for me and I'll sit
there<00:04:36.310> and<00:04:36.460> try<00:04:36.699> to<00:04:36.759> continue<00:04:37.090> forward<00:04:43.110> it<00:04:44.110> is

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:44.259 
there and try to continue forward it is

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:47.189 
there and try to continue forward it is
getting<00:04:44.500> kind<00:04:44.710> of<00:04:44.800> getting<00:04:44.949> in<00:04:45.099> the<00:04:45.160> way<00:04:46.169> so<00:04:47.169> I

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:47.199 
getting kind of getting in the way so I

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:48.839 
getting kind of getting in the way so I
need<00:04:47.770> to<00:04:47.830> fix<00:04:47.979> the<00:04:48.099> programming<00:04:48.520> a<00:04:48.550> little<00:04:48.729> bit

00:04:48.839 --> 00:04:48.849 
need to fix the programming a little bit

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:51.990 
need to fix the programming a little bit
the<00:04:49.090> other<00:04:49.360> than<00:04:49.630> that<00:04:49.720> I<00:04:49.960> mean<00:04:50.110> the<00:04:50.759> eyes<00:04:51.759> look

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
the other than that I mean the eyes look

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.700 
the other than that I mean the eyes look
good<00:04:52.210> everything<00:04:52.900> seems<00:04:53.169> to<00:04:53.229> be<00:04:53.289> working<00:04:53.410> ok

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
good everything seems to be working ok

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.300 
good everything seems to be working ok
so<00:04:54.520> maybe<00:04:55.120> I'll<00:04:55.330> fix<00:04:55.509> it<00:04:55.630> oh<00:04:55.900> and<00:04:56.800> that

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
so maybe I'll fix it oh and that

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.330 
so maybe I'll fix it oh and that
clicking<00:04:57.699> noise<00:04:57.729> e<00:04:58.000> here's<00:04:58.389> the<00:04:59.159> left<00:05:00.159> and

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
clicking noise e here's the left and

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.540 
clicking noise e here's the left and
right<00:05:00.690> motors<00:05:01.690> nor<00:05:02.680> the<00:05:02.889> programming<00:05:03.310> for<00:05:03.460> the

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550 
right motors nor the programming for the

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.089 
right motors nor the programming for the
look<00:05:03.699> turn<00:05:04.120> in<00:05:04.300> the<00:05:04.360> right<00:05:04.509> turn<00:05:05.099> fighting

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:06.099 
look turn in the right turn fighting

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:09.480 
look turn in the right turn fighting
with<00:05:06.130> each<00:05:06.280> other<00:05:06.400> so<00:05:07.590> it's<00:05:08.590> turning<00:05:08.919> the<00:05:09.069> turn

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.490 
with each other so it's turning the turn

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.189 
with each other so it's turning the turn
motor<00:05:09.699> on<00:05:09.909> turning<00:05:10.419> it<00:05:10.509> off<00:05:10.630> turning<00:05:10.990> odds

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:11.199 
motor on turning it off turning odds

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:13.710 
motor on turning it off turning odds
right<00:05:11.440> now<00:05:11.620> so<00:05:12.490> Oh<00:05:12.669> eventually<00:05:13.509> get<00:05:13.599> that

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
right now so Oh eventually get that

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:19.550 
right now so Oh eventually get that
fixed<00:05:14.020> to<00:05:14.110> noise<00:05:15.039> that's<00:05:15.430> my<00:05:15.610> new<00:05:15.789> robot<00:05:16.349> and

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:27.959 

check<00:05:20.560> it<00:05:20.680> out<00:05:20.770> the<00:05:20.979> corner<00:05:21.340> there<00:05:26.669> so<00:05:27.669> there

00:05:27.959 --> 00:05:27.969 
check it out the corner there so there

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:30.090 
check it out the corner there so there
we<00:05:28.060> go
