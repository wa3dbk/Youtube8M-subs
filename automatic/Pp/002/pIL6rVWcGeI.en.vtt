recently started playing a bit of modern

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.829 
recently started playing a bit of modern
warfare<00:00:12.929> 3<00:00:13.110> not<00:00:13.530> because<00:00:14.040> i<00:00:14.070> like<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.580> game

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:14.839 
warfare 3 not because i like the game

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:17.120 
warfare 3 not because i like the game
because<00:00:15.839> i<00:00:15.870> want<00:00:16.080> to<00:00:16.109> do<00:00:16.230> some<00:00:16.379> footage<00:00:16.710> for<00:00:16.949> it

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
because i want to do some footage for it

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.660 
because i want to do some footage for it
in<00:00:17.279> anticipation<00:00:17.850> of<00:00:18.029> black<00:00:18.300> ops<00:00:18.330> 2<00:00:19.310> and<00:00:20.310> I

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
in anticipation of black ops 2 and I

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.460 
in anticipation of black ops 2 and I
don't<00:00:20.850> think<00:00:21.390> that<00:00:21.480> modern<00:00:21.930> warfare<00:00:22.050> 3<00:00:22.230> is<00:00:22.410> a

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
don't think that modern warfare 3 is a

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.349 
don't think that modern warfare 3 is a
very<00:00:22.680> good<00:00:22.830> game<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.250> I've<00:00:23.760> uploaded<00:00:23.939> a<00:00:24.180> video

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
very good game and I've uploaded a video

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.099 
very good game and I've uploaded a video
stating<00:00:25.289> why<00:00:25.470> I<00:00:25.500> believe<00:00:25.710> this<00:00:26.010> but<00:00:27.080> one<00:00:28.080> of

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
stating why I believe this but one of

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.140 
stating why I believe this but one of
the<00:00:28.289> main<00:00:28.470> problems<00:00:28.500> I<00:00:29.279> said<00:00:29.580> about<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.970> game

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
the main problems I said about the game

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.620 
the main problems I said about the game
was<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.840> fact<00:00:31.170> that<00:00:31.399> the<00:00:32.399> game's<00:00:32.610> fov<00:00:33.300> was

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
was the fact that the game's fov was

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.740 
was the fact that the game's fov was
simply<00:00:34.110> awful<00:00:35.030> now<00:00:36.030> if<00:00:36.270> you<00:00:36.360> don't<00:00:36.510> know<00:00:36.600> what

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
simply awful now if you don't know what

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.880 
simply awful now if you don't know what
fov<00:00:37.140> is<00:00:37.290> it<00:00:37.530> stands<00:00:37.770> for<00:00:37.950> field<00:00:38.190> of<00:00:38.340> view<00:00:38.460> and

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
fov is it stands for field of view and

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:46.150 
fov is it stands for field of view and
basically<00:00:40.890> all<00:00:41.010> it<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:41.899> it<00:00:43.129> means<00:00:44.129> how<00:00:44.850> much

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
basically all it is is it means how much

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.470 
basically all it is is it means how much
you<00:00:47.160> can<00:00:47.340> see<00:00:47.610> from<00:00:47.760> left<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.120> right<00:00:48.239> and

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
you can see from left to right and

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.229 
you can see from left to right and
degrees<00:00:48.980> so<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.010> same<00:00:50.250> normal<00:00:50.730> human<00:00:51.030> vision

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
degrees so the same normal human vision

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.760 
degrees so the same normal human vision
is<00:00:51.420> about<00:00:52.699> 140<00:00:53.699> degrees<00:00:53.730> ok<00:00:54.410> from<00:00:55.410> left<00:00:55.680> to

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
is about 140 degrees ok from left to

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.150 
is about 140 degrees ok from left to
right<00:00:55.860> now<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:56.399> is<00:00:56.579> arguable<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.210> know<00:00:57.360> and

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
right now this is arguable I know and

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.840 
right now this is arguable I know and
Sciences<00:00:59.160> disagree<00:00:59.670> on<00:00:59.699> this<00:00:59.820> but<00:01:01.730> call<00:01:02.730> of

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
Sciences disagree on this but call of

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.030 
Sciences disagree on this but call of
duty<00:01:03.149> modern<00:01:03.180> warfare<00:01:03.420> 3<00:01:03.660> has<00:01:04.189> 65<00:01:05.840> fov<00:01:07.040> which

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
duty modern warfare 3 has 65 fov which

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:15.410 
duty modern warfare 3 has 65 fov which
is<00:01:08.659> fairly<00:01:09.659> awful<00:01:12.619> now<00:01:13.850> there<00:01:14.850> there<00:01:14.880> is<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.240> way

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
is fairly awful now there there is a way

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:23.170 
is fairly awful now there there is a way
to<00:01:15.479> fix<00:01:15.810> this<00:01:16.549> and<00:01:17.630> that<00:01:18.630> is<00:01:18.780> using<00:01:19.400> special

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.990 

special<00:01:24.180> program<00:01:24.869> called<00:01:25.560> just<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.310> modern

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
special program called just a modern

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.210 
special program called just a modern
warfare<00:01:27.180> 3<00:01:27.330> fov<00:01:28.640> and<00:01:29.640> now<00:01:30.439> what<00:01:31.439> it<00:01:31.560> does<00:01:31.829> is<00:01:32.159> it

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
warfare 3 fov and now what it does is it

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.160 
warfare 3 fov and now what it does is it
basically<00:01:32.579> makes<00:01:33.890> make<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.100> game<00:01:35.630> much<00:01:36.630> wider

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
basically makes make the game much wider

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.590 
basically makes make the game much wider
so<00:01:38.009> you<00:01:38.100> don't<00:01:38.490> get<00:01:38.729> that<00:01:38.970> tunnel<00:01:39.329> vision

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
so you don't get that tunnel vision

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.230 
so you don't get that tunnel vision
effect<00:01:39.900> while<00:01:40.320> playing<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.130> game<00:01:41.340> ok<00:01:42.180> so

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
effect while playing the game ok so

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.469 
effect while playing the game ok so
basically<00:01:42.540> why<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.500> reason<00:01:43.860> we<00:01:43.950> ask<00:01:44.850> bz<00:01:45.299> game

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
basically why the reason we ask bz game

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.280 
basically why the reason we ask bz game
is<00:01:45.659> get<00:01:45.869> this<00:01:46.020> issue<00:01:46.200> is<00:01:47.040> because<00:01:48.110> when<00:01:49.110> you're

horizontal field of view anyways you

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.440 
horizontal field of view anyways you
don't<00:02:16.140> get<00:02:16.530> that<00:02:16.879> tunnel<00:02:17.879> vision<00:02:18.180> when<00:02:18.209> you're

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
don't get that tunnel vision when you're

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.240 
don't get that tunnel vision when you're

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
further away from it now me I sit next

further away from it now me I sit next
to<00:02:26.280> my<00:02:26.400> minor<00:02:26.640> well<00:02:26.970> I<00:02:27.150> said<00:02:27.510> you<00:02:27.750> know<00:02:27.840> that<00:02:28.700> 60
