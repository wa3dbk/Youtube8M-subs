enjoyed it a lot so much so in fact that
i<00:01:10.799> had<00:01:11.250> this<00:01:11.580> dream<00:01:11.970> when<00:01:12.240> I<00:01:12.270> was<00:01:12.420> in<00:01:12.540> film

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
i had this dream when I was in film

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.060 
i had this dream when I was in film
school<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:13.200> I<00:01:13.229> was<00:01:13.500> going<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.740> be<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.890> person

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
school that I was going to be the person

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.730 
school that I was going to be the person
to<00:01:14.280> adapt<00:01:14.729> this<00:01:15.000> movie<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.290> big<00:01:16.439> screen

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
to adapt this movie to the big screen

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.770 
to adapt this movie to the big screen
and<00:01:16.979> it<00:01:17.100> might<00:01:17.310> sound<00:01:17.580> like<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:17.939> lofty<00:01:18.210> goal<00:01:18.390> and

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
and it might sound like a lofty goal and

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.929 
and it might sound like a lofty goal and
I'm<00:01:18.900> sure<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.439> is<00:01:19.920> because<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.580> rights<00:01:20.820> to

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939
