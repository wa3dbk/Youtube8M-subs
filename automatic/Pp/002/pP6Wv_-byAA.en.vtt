any smartphone today but still I

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.500 
any smartphone today but still I
wouldn't<00:04:00.580> say<00:04:00.790> it's<00:04:00.910> a<00:04:00.970> must-have<00:04:01.209> feature

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
wouldn't say it's a must-have feature

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.690 
wouldn't say it's a must-have feature
but<00:04:02.380> if<00:04:02.470> you<00:04:02.530> look<00:04:02.650> at<00:04:02.739> the<00:04:02.830> iphone<00:04:03.190> overall

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
but if you look at the iphone overall

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.970 
but if you look at the iphone overall
what<00:04:04.570> it<00:04:04.690> can<00:04:04.810> do<00:04:04.930> as<00:04:05.050> a<00:04:05.080> whole<00:04:05.380> you<00:04:05.560> begin<00:04:05.950> to

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
what it can do as a whole you begin to

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.800 
what it can do as a whole you begin to
realize<00:04:06.250> why<00:04:06.640> Apple<00:04:07.000> kept<00:04:07.180> the<00:04:07.330> design<00:04:07.660> the

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
realize why Apple kept the design the

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.750 
realize why Apple kept the design the
same<00:04:08.080> sure<00:04:08.739> a<00:04:08.980> bigger<00:04:09.220> screen<00:04:09.430> would<00:04:09.670> have

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
same sure a bigger screen would have

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.030 
same sure a bigger screen would have
been<00:04:09.880> nice<00:04:10.090> but<00:04:10.450> for<00:04:10.810> now<00:04:10.930> Apple<00:04:11.500> kept<00:04:11.739> what

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
been nice but for now Apple kept what

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.210 
been nice but for now Apple kept what

incredibly fast the charges and this is

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:39.450 
incredibly fast the charges and this is
solely<00:04:37.599> due<00:04:37.870> to<00:04:38.199> the<00:04:38.319> battery<00:04:38.680> size<00:04:39.009> of<00:04:39.370> the
