00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:16.150
 there are people then brand new videos like 

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:17.830
 promises as announced on facebook and 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.349
 especially also on instagram 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.240
 I'd gone from pico today my 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:25.269
 sachet so I made my purchases 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:28.119
 of why I knew they would come out 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:31.480
 the new dabul are silent as we all know 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:34.420
 and from mortacci these are the colors here 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:37.180
 for kiko lips that you apply one 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:40.539
 time on the lips then they dry and 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.680
 with the gloss below you can and moisturize the 

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:43.899
 product if not it can be applied 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.899
 directly on a lip balm when 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:49.180
 it has dried out or even a big one 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:50.920
 something to give even more color and more 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.899
 sae teacher have managed to make one 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.320
 photo so much I put the photo of the 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:55.320
 booth 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.160
 I must say that these colors are 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.440
 really beautiful for now I have taken 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.540
 those you see are no longer beautiful and I have to 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.520
 say they finally made one 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.650
 wide range that is to say that a 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.290
 unlike these which are those 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.750
 in the pro line they really did 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.450
 good colors that is good 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:30.710
 they change and that is not that they look alike 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:33.110
 with the same undertones so I took it 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.360
 then these two new shades for lips 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.640
 that unlike the color limbs mi 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.330
 like and really change colors 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.190
 present are happy colors like you 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.899
 present that always presents to the 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.240
 same way then on one side the 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:49.970
 color on the one hand the cross you can 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.840
 very well see that they have not changed 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.820
 nothing and I think and try to hazard that 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.220
 these will be part of the new line 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.320
 permanent then permanent colors that 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.929
 for the moment we see increase and 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.720
 so others will put them on 16 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:08.240
 I hope because if really for now 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.860
 they put it and then they will come to the garden is 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.110
 a bit of a rip-off because we should 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.540
 run now the piece of what is the 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.780
 price is 6 euros and ninety as always 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.880
 they are of the thought that they are 790 that 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.480
 are worth and have the same amount of 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.200
 product 4 ml of product 24 months of 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.569
 duration therefore 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.400
 very very good very good well 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.379
 let's start showing you the two 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.140
 colors I took before I took it anymore 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:36.180
 this was the number 110 here 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.090
 I must say that I loved it a 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:44.150
 see it immediately because this is it 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:47.130
 beautiful pink orange coral color that 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.910
 I tell you right away that it looks a lot like 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.860
 this is where this pen is 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:55.590
 lipstick balm lipstick of the oreal 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.110
 sorbet works of which I already had 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.989
 made a review I put the video 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.360
 here in the case it may interest you 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.340
 I must say that I took it because I can 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.769
 match together or when I have 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:11.250
 prayed this I can pass over it 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:13.709
 this one of the oreal and hydration one 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.599
 more shine so I got it 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.670
 for this purpose and above all because 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:19.560
 when I was I can use them 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.540
 always together because a color that 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.120
 I also find it perfect for summer or for 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.739
 spring so perfect beautiful 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.890
 just like color I love it 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:32.880
 the second color I took is this 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:35.910
 here his kelly number 114 and this is it 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.370
 beautiful lavender plum 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.680
 light glitter in purple like 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.590
 a lot is very strong in color 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.620
 but I think they are 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:48.500
 same for that tone of color that can 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:51.440
 be used for holes or allo 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.959
 same time as a designer pencil 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:57.349
 then the eye framed only with the 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:59.239
 line I have to say that I am the ones who 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:01.040
 I liked them better for now 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:03.319
 satisfied with these two then slowly 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.470
 I 'm going to see even with calm and 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:09.799
 I see a little because they have to be honest 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:12.470
 it seemed to me the first five six colors 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:14.810
 they were similar to those already there 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.519
 they are so I wanted to see them a little more 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.760
 calmly since I have to go running 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:22.760
 and these are the two colors and what I have 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.710
 taken I hope you like them to start 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.600
 at least to give you an idea 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.210
 I must say that consistency is not 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.400
 changed is always the same and I must say 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:37.780
 also that 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:47.120
 indeed it is in my opinion they fell second 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:49.280
 wait until I pick it up well 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.620
 moment I must say that I think they have 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.270
 also a little more than gloss 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:57.080
 to the others at least I found this 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:59.139
 but I think because these are the seeds 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.120
 of writers let me say a little more sim 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:04.340
 while I have seen from some colors I am a 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:08.180
 bit more parts while others have their own 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:10.699
 See if I'm not mistaken, I'm not all 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:13.100
 all new ones with the colossus e 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:15.949
 transparent did not seem to see how 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:18.590
 in the permanent line that the number 1 e 

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:21.169
 the number 2 years the classic man of letters 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.910
 let me know what you think if you do 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:25.580
 I had a win no I liked them 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:27.949
 a lot like toning then as I have you 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:30.590
 said we go back I send you a kiss there 

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:33.490
 see you at the next video and hope there is 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.490
 was useful hello
