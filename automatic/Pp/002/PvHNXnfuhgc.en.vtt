blocked<00:02:36.049> but<00:02:36.769> you<00:02:36.920> just<00:02:37.130> get<00:02:37.400> the<00:02:37.519> general

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
blocked but you just get the general

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:43.110 
blocked but you just get the general
idea<00:02:37.940> and<00:02:38.390> what<00:02:39.110> you<00:02:39.230> do<00:02:39.410> then<00:02:40.870> to<00:02:41.870> make<00:02:42.440> them

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120

idea and what you do then to make them
even<00:02:44.120> tighter<00:02:44.420> down<00:02:44.840> is<00:02:46.209> push<00:02:47.209> them<00:02:47.480> down

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
even tighter down is push them down

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.530 
even tighter down is push them down
with<00:02:48.920> the<00:02:49.099> end<00:02:49.250> of<00:02:49.430> a<00:02:49.549> broom<00:02:49.819> shaft<00:02:50.209> or

probably in the thirty first 30 seconds

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.949 
probably in the thirty first 30 seconds
the<00:03:29.950> pressure<00:03:31.269> the<00:03:32.269> water<00:03:32.480> is<00:03:32.600> not<00:03:32.720> going<00:03:32.780> to

the pressure the water is not going to

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:35.440 
the pressure the water is not going to
be<00:03:33.019> able<00:03:33.260> to<00:03:33.410> get<00:03:33.739> up<00:03:33.950> the<00:03:34.220> wears<00:03:34.430> so<00:03:35.120> it

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
be able to get up the wears so it

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.710 
be able to get up the wears so it
obviously<00:03:36.019> has<00:03:36.380> to<00:03:36.940> push<00:03:37.940> against<00:03:38.540> the
