00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
thread around drinking straw now make a

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.599 
thread around drinking straw now make a
series<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:58.800> loops<00:00:59.160> on<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.730> drinking<00:01:00.570> straw

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.609 
series of loops on the drinking straw

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:11.649 
series of loops on the drinking straw
and<00:01:02.609> make<00:01:02.879> one<00:01:03.090> more<00:01:03.270> here<00:01:03.570> for<00:01:03.600> you

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:13.630 

I<00:01:11.689> hope<00:01:12.320> this<00:01:12.530> comes<00:01:12.830> all<00:01:13.010> for<00:01:13.220> this<00:01:13.280> video

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
I hope this comes all for this video

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.130 
I hope this comes all for this video
because<00:01:13.850> this<00:01:14.030> is<00:01:14.240> a<00:01:14.270> pretty<00:01:14.570> nice<00:01:14.750> night<00:01:15.110> and

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
because this is a pretty nice night and

because this is a pretty nice night and
it's<00:01:15.470> pretty<00:01:16.250> simple<00:01:16.580> to<00:01:16.670> make<00:01:21.070> so<00:01:22.070> it's<00:01:22.250> just

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
it's pretty simple to make so it's just

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.760 
it's pretty simple to make so it's just
a<00:01:22.640> loop<00:01:23.500> to<00:01:25.000> standard<00:01:26.000> everyday<00:01:26.299> loop<00:01:26.770> pension

here<00:01:28.240> finger

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
here finger

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:35.279 
here finger
I'll<00:01:30.590> wrap<00:01:32.200> three<00:01:33.200> wraps<00:01:33.470> are<00:01:33.680> on<00:01:33.770> the<00:01:33.890> loop

00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:35.289 
I'll wrap three wraps are on the loop

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:41.969 
I'll wrap three wraps are on the loop
bring<00:01:36.289> the<00:01:36.409> tag<00:01:36.680> end<00:01:36.979> back<00:01:37.190> through<00:01:38.380> Center

00:01:49.419 --> 00:01:49.429 
and cinch it all tight that's all there

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:52.480 
and cinch it all tight that's all there
is<00:01:49.550> to<00:01:49.789> make<00:01:49.940> in<00:01:50.090> the<00:01:50.179> Bopper<00:01:50.569> stop<00:01:50.869> not<00:01:51.490> as

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
is to make in the Bopper stop not as

00:01:52.490 --> 00:02:00.330 
is to make in the Bopper stop not as
it's<00:01:52.759> really<00:01:53.030> all<00:01:53.360> there<00:01:53.569> is<00:01:53.600> to<00:01:53.990> it

straw slide the drinking straw my
fishing<00:02:08.840> line<00:02:08.869> to<00:02:09.289> the<00:02:09.800> depth<00:02:10.069> that<00:02:10.340> I<00:02:10.369> want<00:02:10.640> to

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
fishing line to the depth that I want to

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.290 
fishing line to the depth that I want to
fish<00:02:10.910> at<00:02:11.150> and<00:02:11.500> I'll<00:02:12.500> slide<00:02:13.280> this<00:02:13.459> Bopper<00:02:13.970> stop

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
fish at and I'll slide this Bopper stop

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.500 
fish at and I'll slide this Bopper stop
not<00:02:14.569> off<00:02:15.020> the<00:02:15.319> drinking<00:02:15.680> straw<00:02:15.709> and<00:02:16.510> I'll

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
not off the drinking straw and I'll

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.710 
not off the drinking straw and I'll
cinch<00:02:18.380> it<00:02:18.530> together<00:02:19.540> real<00:02:20.540> tight<00:02:22.030> and<00:02:23.030> then

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
cinch it together real tight and then

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.420 
cinch it together real tight and then
take<00:02:24.230> and<00:02:24.470> cut<00:02:24.709> both<00:02:25.250> of<00:02:25.489> the<00:02:25.580> tag<00:02:25.819> ends<00:02:26.239> off<00:02:27.430> so

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
take and cut both of the tag ends off so

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.190 
take and cut both of the tag ends off so
that<00:02:28.670> the<00:02:29.000> knot<00:02:29.390> itself<00:02:29.870> can<00:02:31.930> completely<00:02:32.930> pass

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
that the knot itself can completely pass

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.130 
that the knot itself can completely pass
through<00:02:33.500> the<00:02:33.620> fishing<00:02:33.950> reel<00:02:34.880> when<00:02:35.120> I<00:02:35.150> crank<00:02:35.959> my

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
through the fishing reel when I crank my

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:42.640 
through the fishing reel when I crank my
line<00:02:36.380> in<00:02:38.890> that's<00:02:39.890> my<00:02:40.010> Bopper<00:02:40.459> stop<00:02:40.730> not<00:02:41.650> my

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
line in that's my Bopper stop not my

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.460 
line in that's my Bopper stop not my
version<00:02:42.950> of<00:02:43.250> it<00:02:43.400> anyway<00:02:43.730> and<00:02:43.910> it's<00:02:44.060> a<00:02:44.470> lot

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
version of it anyway and it's a lot

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.059 
version of it anyway and it's a lot
cheaper<00:02:45.500> and<00:02:46.130> it's<00:02:46.280> very<00:02:46.790> simple<00:02:47.209> to<00:02:47.330> make<00:02:48.069> it

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
cheaper and it's very simple to make it

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.280 
cheaper and it's very simple to make it
very<00:02:49.970> light<00:02:50.269> and<00:02:50.450> easy<00:02:50.540> to<00:02:50.750> carry<00:02:50.870> in<00:02:51.200> the

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
very light and easy to carry in the
