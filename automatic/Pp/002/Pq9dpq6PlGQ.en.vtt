is the same juggle mode only changes
these<00:00:33.930> controls<00:00:34.530> so<00:00:35.219> now<00:00:35.460> these<00:00:36.149> controls<00:00:36.600> are

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660

turn on an effect first let's go to
let's<00:01:41.170> say<00:01:41.380> the<00:01:41.710> reverb<00:01:42.780> again<00:01:43.780> I<00:01:43.810> go<00:01:44.110> to

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
let's say the reverb again I go to

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.910 
let's say the reverb again I go to

we've<00:01:48.340> got<00:01:48.610> reverb<00:01:49.240> and<00:01:49.450> then<00:01:50.290> select<00:01:51.130> the

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
we've got reverb and then select the

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.900 
we've got reverb and then select the
reverb<00:01:52.289> now<00:01:53.289> if<00:01:53.410> we<00:01:53.530> turn<00:01:53.770> on<00:01:53.920> fader<00:01:54.490> effects

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:54.910 
reverb now if we turn on fader effects

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.860 
reverb now if we turn on fader effects
mode<00:01:55.830> bringing<00:01:56.830> this<00:01:57.009> fader<00:01:57.280> down

00:01:59.860 --> 00:01:59.870 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.970 

get<00:02:00.320> back<00:02:00.500> on<00:02:00.830> bring<00:02:01.580> it<00:02:01.700> up<00:02:01.850> and<00:02:02.860> pushing<00:02:03.860> it

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:03.980 
get back on bring it up and pushing it

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:26.620 
get back on bring it up and pushing it
all<00:02:04.160> the<00:02:04.370> way<00:02:04.490> down<00:02:04.520> will<00:02:05.360> freeze<00:02:05.750> it

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.030 

as<00:02:27.630> you<00:02:27.750> can<00:02:27.840> see<00:02:28.050> it's<00:02:28.200> pretty<00:02:28.500> cool<00:02:28.800> with

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
as you can see it's pretty cool with

00:02:29.040 --> 00:03:05.690 
as you can see it's pretty cool with
reverb<00:02:29.400> let's<00:02:29.790> try<00:02:30.000> it<00:02:30.120> with<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.840> beat<00:02:31.470> masher

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.069 

so<00:03:06.700> believe<00:03:06.969> it<00:03:07.120> or<00:03:07.150> not<00:03:07.329> that<00:03:07.540> pretty<00:03:07.840> much

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
so believe it or not that pretty much

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:12.089 
so believe it or not that pretty much
covers<00:03:08.319> everything<00:03:09.040> on<00:03:09.430> the<00:03:09.819> vestax<00:03:10.269> vci<00:03:11.099> 100

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:12.099

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:14.670 
covers everything on the vestax vci 100
s<00:03:12.280> ii<00:03:12.609> it's<00:03:13.239> also<00:03:13.450> a<00:03:13.599> midi<00:03:13.840> controller<00:03:13.900> so<00:03:14.590> you

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
s ii it's also a midi controller so you

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.740 
s ii it's also a midi controller so you
can<00:03:14.859> reassign<00:03:15.459> things<00:03:15.819> as<00:03:16.000> you<00:03:16.120> see<00:03:16.480> fit

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
can reassign things as you see fit

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.449 
can reassign things as you see fit
there's<00:03:17.409> one<00:03:17.469> thing<00:03:17.829> you<00:03:17.980> should<00:03:18.010> keep<00:03:18.280> in

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
there's one thing you should keep in

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.160 
there's one thing you should keep in

to<00:03:31.599> any<00:03:31.840> other<00:03:32.049> software<00:03:32.439> you're<00:03:33.099> gonna<00:03:33.189> have

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
to any other software you're gonna have

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.770 
to any other software you're gonna have
difficulty<00:03:33.909> doing<00:03:33.939> it<00:03:34.359> because<00:03:34.480> there's<00:03:34.719> a

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
difficulty doing it because there's a

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.110 
difficulty doing it because there's a
lot<00:03:34.989> of<00:03:35.019> data<00:03:35.379> spitting<00:03:35.889> out<00:03:36.040> so<00:03:36.730> you<00:03:36.790> might

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
lot of data spitting out so you might

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.940 
lot of data spitting out so you might
want<00:03:37.359> to<00:03:37.450> switch<00:03:37.569> back<00:03:37.870> to<00:03:37.930> firmware<00:03:38.379> version

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
want to switch back to firmware version

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.330 
want to switch back to firmware version
1.2<00:03:39.730> what<00:03:40.450> you<00:03:40.599> can<00:03:40.750> do<00:03:40.959> directly<00:03:41.680> on<00:03:41.859> the<00:03:42.010> unit

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
1.2 what you can do directly on the unit

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.309 
1.2 what you can do directly on the unit
let<00:03:42.819> me<00:03:42.939> show<00:03:43.090> you<00:03:43.120> how<00:03:45.269> so<00:03:46.269> if<00:03:46.569> we<00:03:46.900> turn<00:03:47.139> the

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 
let me show you how so if we turn the

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:49.860 
let me show you how so if we turn the
unit<00:03:47.349> off<00:03:47.709> hold<00:03:48.700> down<00:03:48.849> loop<00:03:49.180> button<00:03:49.599> number

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
unit off hold down loop button number

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.309 
unit off hold down loop button number
one<00:03:50.169> and<00:03:50.439> turn<00:03:50.859> it<00:03:51.040> on<00:03:51.189> and<00:03:51.629> you're<00:03:52.629> in<00:03:52.780> regular

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:53.319 
one and turn it on and you're in regular

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:56.520 
one and turn it on and you're in regular
1.2<00:03:54.069> mode<00:03:54.659> again<00:03:55.659> so<00:03:56.230> you<00:03:56.319> don't<00:03:56.469> have

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
1.2 mode again so you don't have

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.080 
1.2 mode again so you don't have

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:03.879 
knobs turn it off hold loop number two

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:11.069 
knobs turn it off hold loop number two
down<00:04:04.169> or<00:04:05.169> loop<00:04:06.040> be<00:04:06.959> or<00:04:07.959> right<00:04:08.739> back<00:04:08.949> in<00:04:09.159> 1.3<00:04:10.079> so
