00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
might be about the time when you might

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:09.910 
might be about the time when you might
want<00:03:08.930> to<00:03:08.959> think<00:03:09.140> about<00:03:09.290> getting<00:03:09.500> a<00:03:09.680> little<00:03:09.830> bit

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
want to think about getting a little bit

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.780 
want to think about getting a little bit
of<00:03:09.980> golden<00:03:10.549> prospects<00:03:10.970> but<00:03:11.810> I<00:03:11.900> highly

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
of golden prospects but I highly

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.370 
of golden prospects but I highly
recommend<00:03:13.790> against<00:03:14.330> going<00:03:14.600> for<00:03:14.900> the<00:03:14.959> arcane

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
recommend against going for the arcane

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.080 
recommend against going for the arcane
archers<00:03:15.739> there's<00:03:16.040> pretty<00:03:16.190> much<00:03:16.250> no<00:03:16.580> point<00:03:16.940> to

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
archers there's pretty much no point to

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.820 
archers there's pretty much no point to
doing<00:03:17.360> that<00:03:17.510> because<00:03:18.380> I<00:03:18.530> don't<00:03:18.650> know<00:03:18.709> any

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
doing that because I don't know any

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.610 
doing that because I don't know any
magic<00:03:18.950> so<00:03:19.549> like<00:03:19.700> you<00:03:20.030> know<00:03:20.060> Oh<00:03:20.380> third<00:03:21.380> tier

arcane<00:03:25.190> archers<00:03:25.459> and<00:03:26.000> you're<00:03:26.209> gonna<00:03:26.299> be<00:03:26.420> set

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
arcane archers and you're gonna be set

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:27.670 
arcane archers and you're gonna be set
this<00:03:26.720> is<00:03:26.840> pretty<00:03:26.989> much<00:03:27.049> like<00:03:27.140> the<00:03:27.350> bait<00:03:27.530> the

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
this is pretty much like the bait the

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.770 
this is pretty much like the bait the
basic<00:03:28.010> defense<00:03:28.340> for<00:03:28.489> what<00:03:28.580> you<00:03:28.700> want<00:03:28.820> to<00:03:28.880> do<00:03:28.970> I

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
basic defense for what you want to do I

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.360 
basic defense for what you want to do I
think<00:03:30.440> it's<00:03:30.590> pretty<00:03:30.680> much<00:03:30.769> all<00:03:30.980> set<00:03:31.130> up<00:03:31.250> right

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
think it's pretty much all set up right

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.699 
think it's pretty much all set up right
now<00:03:32.080> honestly<00:03:33.080> we<00:03:33.140> could<00:03:33.260> probably<00:03:33.350> beat<00:03:33.620> it

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
now honestly we could probably beat it

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:34.870 
now honestly we could probably beat it
with<00:03:33.799> just<00:03:34.010> this<00:03:34.130> defense<00:03:34.519> right<00:03:34.700> here

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
with just this defense right here

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.610 
with just this defense right here
depending<00:03:35.600> on<00:03:35.690> how<00:03:35.810> long<00:03:36.049> this<00:03:36.260> challenge

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
depending on how long this challenge

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:37.330 
depending on how long this challenge
actually<00:03:36.980> is

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
actually is

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.920 
actually is
I<00:03:37.370> assume<00:03:37.820> that's<00:03:38.000> only<00:03:38.209> about<00:03:38.360> another<00:03:38.690> two

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
I assume that's only about another two

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.330 
I assume that's only about another two
minutes<00:03:39.230> longer<00:03:39.680> that's<00:03:39.830> usually<00:03:40.100> about<00:03:40.220> the

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
minutes longer that's usually about the

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.590 
minutes longer that's usually about the
time<00:03:40.370> the<00:03:40.640> design<00:03:40.880> challenges<00:03:41.299> are<00:03:41.420> five<00:03:41.570> and

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
time the design challenges are five and

time the design challenges are five and
a<00:03:41.750> half<00:03:41.780> minutes<00:03:42.140> or<00:03:42.230> so<00:03:42.459> especially<00:03:43.459> this

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
a half minutes or so especially this

a half minutes or so especially this
late<00:03:43.670> in<00:03:43.760> the<00:03:43.820> game<00:03:43.880> but<00:03:44.530> they<00:03:45.530> might<00:03:45.739> be<00:03:45.830> a
