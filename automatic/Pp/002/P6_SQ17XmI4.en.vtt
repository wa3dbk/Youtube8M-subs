00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.299
 hello i am kasia and you don't have one 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.650
 just a full bunch of curls of yourself 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:11.490
 would like this there for example 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.990
 a party 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.839
 then bring it with this curling iron 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.410
 Remington CI 8319 easily 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.410
 change in 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.580
 when we remove the curling iron from packaging 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.949
 then of course the curling iron itself will see it 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.720
 stylish heat-resistant storage case 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.320
 and of course you also get one 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.320
 manual with 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.199
 if we need the curling iron from closer 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.080
 view then of course we see the 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:39.120
 beautiful curling iron itself 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.469
 Here we see the tube that is fitted with 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.660
 high-quality ceramic coating 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.430
 impregnated with caring keratin 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.309
 for mobile healthy and strong 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.930
 curls then we also see that you set the 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.469
 put it down so that you have one 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.030
 handy standard then see 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.250
 your three buttons 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.750
 this is of course the on-off button and with 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.010
 these two keys can change the temperature 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.090
 set for 130 to 210 degrees 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.330
 then you see the display here 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.950
 on which you can read the temperature 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.880
 and here we still see the full 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.880
 rotating cord 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.550
 then i would just show you how 

00:01:12.599 --> 00:01:15.899
 can easily make years 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.970
 of course I have a moment in advance 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:20.940
 protective series applied my hair 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.910
 that it can't burn i will give him 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.190
 of course, first turn on 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.500
 Then I put it on 190 degrees 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.789
 I have pretty thick hair 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.330
 and then i can get it within 30 seconds 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:32.330
 use 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.940
 so 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.229
 then see the result here this is mine 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.670
 ordinary 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.670
 and now we see the curled hair 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.490
 The curling iron does not boot io 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.790
 function with which you can do static hair 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.790
 appearance 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.630
 thanks to the five temperature settings, the 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.890
 Curling iron very suitable for all hair types 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.480
 and you sometimes forget the curling iron 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.440
 to turn off that is from now on none 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.420
 problem more 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.420
 because after 60 minutes it switches itself off 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.880
 do you have hair but do you want to 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.970
 agree curls that look healthy and strong 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.209
 look like it is a series for him there 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.800

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.510
