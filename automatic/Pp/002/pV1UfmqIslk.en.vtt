00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:15.430 
are you this is not first layer but

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:16.770 
are you this is not first layer but
there's<00:00:15.639> many<00:00:15.969> different<00:00:16.030> game<00:00:16.360> types<00:00:16.390> you

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:16.780 
there's many different game types you

can play with this it works for every
game<00:00:19.060> type<00:00:19.330> I<00:00:19.420> think<00:00:19.720> except<00:00:20.140> for<00:00:20.410> race<00:00:21.039> just

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:21.430 
game type I think except for race just

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:22.980 
game type I think except for race just
about<00:00:21.580> every<00:00:21.789> game<00:00:21.970> type<00:00:22.180> so<00:00:22.390> its<00:00:22.510> previous

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:22.990 
about every game type so its previous

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.890 
about every game type so its previous
map<00:00:23.260> but<00:00:24.040> I'm<00:00:24.160> as<00:00:24.370> you<00:00:24.520> saw<00:00:24.700> there<00:00:24.730> there's<00:00:25.420> two

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:25.900 
map but I'm as you saw there there's two

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.020 
map but I'm as you saw there there's two
cylindrical<00:00:26.260> domes<00:00:27.100> or<00:00:27.430> you<00:00:27.910> know

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:28.030 
cylindrical domes or you know

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:31.140 
cylindrical domes or you know
cylindrical<00:00:28.690> pieces<00:00:29.680> that<00:00:30.430> are<00:00:30.520> they<00:00:30.880> can<00:00:31.060> you

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.150 
cylindrical pieces that are they can you

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.540 
cylindrical pieces that are they can you
know<00:00:31.240> the<00:00:31.510> make<00:00:31.660> up<00:00:31.840> each<00:00:31.990> base<00:00:32.320> there's<00:00:33.219> three

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.550 
know the make up each base there's three

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.700 
know the make up each base there's three
levels<00:00:33.879> in<00:00:33.969> each<00:00:34.059> of<00:00:34.180> those<00:00:34.270> bases<00:00:34.750> right<00:00:35.500> now

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
levels in each of those bases right now

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.190 
levels in each of those bases right now
I'm<00:00:35.890> on<00:00:36.070> the<00:00:36.280> bottom<00:00:36.910> level<00:00:37.120> the<00:00:37.629> underground

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:38.200 
I'm on the bottom level the underground

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.440 
I'm on the bottom level the underground
water<00:00:39.070> level<00:00:39.579> I<00:00:39.610> guess<00:00:39.790> you<00:00:39.880> could<00:00:40.000> say<00:00:40.210> and

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:40.450 
water level I guess you could say and

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:41.790 
water level I guess you could say and
it's<00:00:40.960> pretty<00:00:41.110> cool<00:00:41.230> you<00:00:41.290> can<00:00:41.500> actually<00:00:41.740> go

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:48.310 
water bottle area and then you know

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:49.680 
water bottle area and then you know
they've<00:00:48.430> got<00:00:48.550> the<00:00:48.700> mid<00:00:48.970> the<00:00:49.360> middle<00:00:49.570> layer

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
they've got the mid the middle layer

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.130 
they've got the mid the middle layer
than<00:00:49.900> the<00:00:49.960> top<00:00:50.140> layer<00:00:50.380> and<00:00:50.560> um<00:00:51.750> there's<00:00:52.750> plenty

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
than the top layer and um there's plenty

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.290 
than the top layer and um there's plenty
of<00:00:53.170> ways<00:00:53.380> to<00:00:53.440> get<00:00:53.770> to<00:00:53.920> eat<00:00:54.100> you<00:00:55.030> know<00:00:55.149> each

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
of ways to get to eat you know each

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.720 
of ways to get to eat you know each
cylindrical<00:00:56.079> base<00:00:56.620> so<00:00:57.309> I<00:00:57.340> mean<00:00:57.460> it's<00:00:57.579> like

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
cylindrical base so I mean it's like

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.130 
cylindrical base so I mean it's like
tons<00:00:58.030> different<00:00:58.300> path<00:00:58.480> you'll<00:00:58.750> see<00:00:58.870> here<00:00:59.020> in<00:00:59.079> a

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
tons different path you'll see here in a

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.530 
tons different path you'll see here in a
second<00:00:59.500> but<00:00:59.620> I<00:00:59.680> mean<00:00:59.800> when<00:01:00.790> I<00:01:00.850> first<00:01:01.090> you<00:01:01.450> know

second but I mean when I first you know
soccer<00:01:01.809> play<00:01:01.989> this<00:01:02.050> game<00:01:02.260> guess<00:01:02.980> map<00:01:03.220> um<00:01:03.520> it

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000

was<00:01:04.180> looked<00:01:04.629> pretty<00:01:04.869> cool<00:01:05.019> thought<00:01:05.379> yeah<00:01:05.710> it's

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
was looked pretty cool thought yeah it's

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.800 
was looked pretty cool thought yeah it's
gonna<00:01:06.009> be<00:01:06.100> awesome<00:01:06.280> map<00:01:06.640> looks<00:01:07.329> really<00:01:07.540> fun

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
gonna be awesome map looks really fun

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.719 
gonna be awesome map looks really fun
but<00:01:08.500> then<00:01:08.710> once<00:01:09.040> we<00:01:09.219> actually<00:01:09.340> started<00:01:09.670> to

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
but then once we actually started to

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:12.300 
but then once we actually started to
play<00:01:10.000> it<00:01:10.150> and<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:11.350> know<00:01:11.440> my<00:01:11.620> opinion<00:01:11.890> started

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
play it and you know my opinion started

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.140 
play it and you know my opinion started
to<00:01:12.370> change<00:01:13.770> mainly<00:01:14.770> I<00:01:15.040> guess<00:01:15.729> the<00:01:15.820> reason<00:01:15.970> why

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.150 
to change mainly I guess the reason why

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:17.610 
to change mainly I guess the reason why
they<00:01:16.270> changed<00:01:16.450> because<00:01:16.720> this<00:01:17.110> Matt<00:01:17.260> does<00:01:17.440> not

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:17.620 
they changed because this Matt does not

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.010 
they changed because this Matt does not
play<00:01:17.830> very<00:01:17.860> well<00:01:18.130> and<00:01:18.549> I<00:01:19.479> was<00:01:19.570> trying<00:01:19.930> to<00:01:19.960> think

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
play very well and I was trying to think

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.960 
play very well and I was trying to think
of<00:01:20.200> ways<00:01:20.409> on<00:01:20.650> how<00:01:20.680> to<00:01:20.799> explain<00:01:21.250> this<00:01:21.310> and<00:01:21.760> I

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
of ways on how to explain this and I

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.370 
of ways on how to explain this and I
guess<00:01:22.150> the<00:01:22.299> best<00:01:22.479> way<00:01:22.690> for<00:01:22.869> me<00:01:22.900> explain<00:01:23.290> this

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
guess the best way for me explain this

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.649 
guess the best way for me explain this
would<00:01:23.560> be<00:01:23.740> for<00:01:24.400> you<00:01:24.490> guys<00:01:24.610> to<00:01:24.760> go<00:01:24.880> out<00:01:24.909> and<00:01:25.330> play

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659 
would be for you guys to go out and play

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:27.359 
would be for you guys to go out and play
it<00:01:25.780> yourself<00:01:26.140> because<00:01:26.320> I<00:01:26.770> couldn't<00:01:27.159> think<00:01:27.190> of

it yourself because I couldn't think of

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:30.480 
it yourself because I couldn't think of
any<00:01:27.490> ways<00:01:27.670> to<00:01:27.790> explain<00:01:28.150> it<00:01:28.299> but<00:01:29.260> um<00:01:29.440> sorry<00:01:30.340> for
