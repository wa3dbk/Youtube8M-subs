vibrancy<00:01:23.550> due<00:01:24.550> to<00:01:24.910> the<00:01:25.240> thinning<00:01:25.870> of<00:01:26.110> the

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
vibrancy due to the thinning of the

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.360 
vibrancy due to the thinning of the
metallics<00:01:27.700> that<00:01:27.910> I'm<00:01:28.000> going<00:01:28.180> to<00:01:28.270> be<00:01:28.330> doing<00:01:29.370> so

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:30.370 
metallics that I'm going to be doing so

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.880 
metallics that I'm going to be doing so
we've<00:01:30.550> got<00:01:30.730> our<00:01:30.760> color<00:01:31.980> mixed<00:01:32.980> up<00:01:33.100> there<00:01:33.420> so

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
we've got our color mixed up there so

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:42.540

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:42.550 
take laguna here again take some of our

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:51.390 
take laguna here again take some of our
mixed<00:01:42.850> up<00:01:43.000> color<00:01:49.230> and<00:01:50.230> i<00:01:50.710> usually<00:01:51.010> start<00:01:51.220> in

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
mixed up color and i usually start in

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.570 
mixed up color and i usually start in
the<00:01:51.490> center<00:01:51.730> and<00:01:52.180> kind<00:01:52.510> of<00:01:52.600> radiate<00:01:53.110> out<00:01:53.580> helps

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
the center and kind of radiate out helps

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.840 
the center and kind of radiate out helps
me<00:01:54.730> keep<00:01:54.940> that<00:01:55.210> edge<00:01:56.160> that<00:01:57.160> I<00:01:57.190> want<00:01:57.520> around<00:01:57.910> it

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
me keep that edge that I want around it

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.219 
me keep that edge that I want around it
again<00:02:00.850> it<00:02:00.970> doesn't<00:02:01.150> have<00:02:01.390> to<00:02:01.540> be<00:02:01.570> perfect<00:02:04.229> you

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
again it doesn't have to be perfect you

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.440 
again it doesn't have to be perfect you
can<00:02:05.380> always<00:02:05.560> go<00:02:05.830> back<00:02:05.860> fine<00:02:06.550> line<00:02:06.880> touch<00:02:07.240> up

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
can always go back fine line touch up

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.630 
can always go back fine line touch up
later<00:02:07.720> even<00:02:08.500> if<00:02:08.590> you<00:02:08.710> don't<00:02:08.890> get<00:02:09.160> that<00:02:09.220> black

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
later even if you don't get that black

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.410 
later even if you don't get that black
edge<00:02:09.880> perfect<00:02:11.760> you<00:02:12.760> can<00:02:12.880> go<00:02:13.000> back<00:02:13.180> in

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
edge perfect you can go back in

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.540 
edge perfect you can go back in
afterwards<00:02:14.050> when<00:02:14.740> you're<00:02:14.920> complete<00:02:15.280> when

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
afterwards when you're complete when

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.690 
afterwards when you're complete when
you've<00:02:15.670> completed<00:02:15.820> the<00:02:16.210> eye<00:02:16.270> and<00:02:17.040> then<00:02:18.040> clean

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
you've completed the eye and then clean

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:28.559 
you've completed the eye and then clean
that<00:02:18.940> up

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.500 

and<00:02:28.930> also<00:02:29.920> you<00:02:30.430> know<00:02:30.519> as<00:02:30.700> I<00:02:30.969> said<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:31.299> purpose

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
and also you know as I said the purpose

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:39.569 
and also you know as I said the purpose
with<00:02:32.170> the<00:02:32.319> thinning<00:02:32.680> is<00:02:34.620> to<00:02:37.889> make<00:02:38.889> sure<00:02:39.249> that

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:39.579 
with the thinning is to make sure that

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:44.520 
with the thinning is to make sure that
we<00:02:39.670> get<00:02:39.849> a<00:02:40.090> nice<00:02:40.780> smooth<00:02:41.319> coat<00:02:42.269> so<00:02:43.269> this<00:02:44.109> yellow

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
we get a nice smooth coat so this yellow

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.979 
we get a nice smooth coat so this yellow
is<00:02:44.680> probably<00:02:45.159> going<00:02:45.700> to<00:02:45.939> take<00:02:46.090> at<00:02:46.359> least<00:02:46.569> three

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
is probably going to take at least three

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.099 
is probably going to take at least three
coats<00:02:47.290> for<00:02:48.280> us<00:02:48.400> to<00:02:48.549> get<00:02:48.730> this<00:02:49.090> to<00:02:49.629> look<00:02:49.780> the<00:02:49.989> way

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:50.109 
coats for us to get this to look the way

00:02:50.109 --> 00:03:13.150 
coats for us to get this to look the way
we<00:02:50.139> want<00:02:50.439> it<00:02:50.530> to<00:02:50.590> look

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:04:26.760 

so<00:03:13.700> you<00:03:13.820> can<00:03:14.120> kind<00:03:14.600> of<00:03:14.750> see<00:03:14.810> it<00:03:15.050> starting<00:03:15.530> there

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.830 

you
