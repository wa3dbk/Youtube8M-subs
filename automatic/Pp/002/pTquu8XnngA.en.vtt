why<00:00:56.230> these<00:00:56.290> are<00:00:56.530> smaller<00:00:56.799> than<00:00:56.979> they're<00:00:57.580> a<00:00:57.610> lot

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760

smaller they're supposed to be I mean

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:00.390 
smaller they're supposed to be I mean
this<00:00:59.440> must<00:00:59.530> be<00:00:59.710> much<00:00:59.799> bigger

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:00.400 
this must be much bigger

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.430

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
of the plastic in this heater to produce

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:57.680 
of the plastic in this heater to produce
again<00:01:51.270> this<00:01:51.450> year<00:01:56.149> they<00:01:57.149> were<00:01:57.210> planted

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690

tomatoes<00:01:58.970> they're<00:01:59.970> here<00:02:00.210> because<00:02:00.330> in<00:02:00.780> the

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
tomatoes they're here because in the

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.660 
tomatoes they're here because in the
past<00:02:01.050> we<00:02:01.440> had<00:02:01.590> Tomatoes<00:02:02.009> over<00:02:02.490> on<00:02:02.580> the<00:02:02.640> other

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.550 
past we had Tomatoes over on the other
bed<00:02:03.090> so<00:02:03.390> it's<00:02:03.509> good<00:02:03.690> to<00:02:03.720> rotate<00:02:04.229> your<00:02:04.380> crops

bed so it's good to rotate your crops
and<00:02:05.039> move<00:02:05.159> them<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.460> different<00:02:05.759> spot<00:02:06.030> each

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
and move them to a different spot each

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:13.160 
and move them to a different spot each
season<00:02:09.619> here<00:02:10.619> our<00:02:11.720> carrots<00:02:12.720> have<00:02:12.870> gone<00:02:13.019> to

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.170 
season here our carrots have gone to
flower<00:02:13.470> we<00:02:14.130> should<00:02:14.340> have<00:02:14.430> picked<00:02:14.610> them<00:02:14.819> before

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.760 

we've<00:04:32.300> had<00:04:32.480> these<00:04:32.600> dewberries<00:04:33.050> for<00:04:33.320> years<00:04:33.560> now

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770

we've had these dewberries for years now
we<00:04:34.040> started<00:04:34.310> off<00:04:34.430> with<00:04:34.580> three<00:04:34.880> plants<00:04:36.070> and

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
we started off with three plants and

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:42.250 
we started off with three plants and
just<00:04:38.060> kept<00:04:38.240> propagating<00:04:38.930> them<00:04:41.050> okay<00:04:42.050> so<00:04:42.110> I'm

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
just kept propagating them okay so I'm

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.440 
just kept propagating them okay so I'm
gonna<00:04:42.440> do<00:04:42.590> berry<00:04:42.800> to<00:04:42.920> propagate<00:04:43.430> it<00:04:43.580> we<00:04:44.300> could

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.450 
gonna do berry to propagate it we could

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.990 
gonna do berry to propagate it we could
take<00:04:44.660> this<00:04:44.840> one<00:04:45.050> here<00:04:45.500> and<00:04:45.680> bend<00:04:46.580> it<00:04:46.670> down<00:04:46.700> and

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
take this one here and bend it down and

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.790 
take this one here and bend it down and
actually<00:04:47.090> just<00:04:47.420> put<00:04:47.630> a<00:04:47.660> rock<00:04:47.960> on<00:04:47.990> top<00:04:48.410> of<00:04:48.620> it

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
actually just put a rock on top of it

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.160 
actually just put a rock on top of it
and<00:04:49.150> you<00:04:50.150> could<00:04:50.300> take<00:04:50.330> up<00:04:50.630> make<00:04:50.780> it<00:04:50.810> just<00:04:51.050> a

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:51.170 
and you could take up make it just a

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:55.300 
and you could take up make it just a

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
going to root into the ground and once

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.890
