00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.820 
um everywhere else the fades it aired
over<00:02:14.319> there<00:02:14.769> and<00:02:15.540> then<00:02:16.540> I<00:02:16.959> have<00:02:17.230> like<00:02:17.470> six

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
over there and then I have like six

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.520 
over there and then I have like six
months<00:02:18.040> later<00:02:18.430> in<00:02:18.790> air<00:02:19.000> on<00:02:19.180> BBC<00:02:19.360> America<00:02:19.750> so<00:02:20.470> it

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
months later in air on BBC America so it

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.500 
months later in air on BBC America so it
was<00:02:20.709> already<00:02:20.920> aired<00:02:21.400> over<00:02:21.879> with

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
was already aired over with

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.080 
was already aired over with
so<00:02:22.750> I<00:02:22.810> actually<00:02:23.019> watched<00:02:23.349> it<00:02:23.620> online<00:02:23.800> like<00:02:24.760> two

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
so I actually watched it online like two

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.640 
so I actually watched it online like two
weeks<00:02:25.300> before<00:02:25.480> it<00:02:25.720> was<00:02:25.780> gonna<00:02:25.959> air<00:02:26.230> on<00:02:26.470> BBC

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
weeks before it was gonna air on BBC

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.500 
weeks before it was gonna air on BBC
America<00:02:26.980> because<00:02:27.549> I<00:02:27.580> was<00:02:27.760> too<00:02:27.879> impatient<00:02:28.390> to

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
America because I was too impatient to

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.289 
America because I was too impatient to
wait<00:02:28.540> but<00:02:29.069> that's<00:02:30.069> not<00:02:30.459> gonna<00:02:30.610> have<00:02:30.849> a<00:02:30.879> second

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
wait but that's not gonna have a second

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:33.570 
wait but that's not gonna have a second
season<00:02:31.480> I<00:02:31.959> was<00:02:32.319> really<00:02:32.680> upset<00:02:32.830> when<00:02:33.250> I<00:02:33.310> found

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
season I was really upset when I found

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.470 
season I was really upset when I found
that<00:02:33.640> out<00:02:34.180> bedlam<00:02:34.959> which<00:02:35.950> I<00:02:36.430> think<00:02:37.000> that<00:02:37.239> they

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
that out bedlam which I think that they

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.869 
that out bedlam which I think that they
also<00:02:37.690> did<00:02:38.110> the<00:02:38.349> thing<00:02:39.040> where<00:02:39.250> aired<00:02:39.549> over

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:39.879 
also did the thing where aired over

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:41.520 
also did the thing where aired over
there<00:02:40.060> and<00:02:40.239> then<00:02:40.330> a<00:02:40.360> few<00:02:40.810> months<00:02:40.959> later<00:02:41.140> they

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
there and then a few months later they

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.289 
there and then a few months later they
aired<00:02:41.769> it<00:02:41.950> on<00:02:41.980> BBC<00:02:42.519> America<00:02:42.610> and<00:02:43.620> I<00:02:45.299> guess

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
aired it on BBC America and I guess

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:47.970 
aired it on BBC America and I guess
they're<00:02:46.599> gonna<00:02:46.720> do<00:02:47.140> the<00:02:47.290> same<00:02:47.530> thing<00:02:47.739> with

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
they're gonna do the same thing with

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.410 
they're gonna do the same thing with
season<00:02:48.340> two<00:02:48.489> because<00:02:48.700> that's<00:02:48.970> supposed<00:02:49.299> to<00:02:49.329> be

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
season two because that's supposed to be

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.610 
season two because that's supposed to be
starting<00:02:49.630> soon<00:02:49.900> but<00:02:50.110> I'll<00:02:50.170> probably<00:02:50.349> just

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
starting soon but I'll probably just

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.170 
starting soon but I'll probably just
watch<00:02:50.769> it<00:02:50.950> or<00:02:51.069> mine<00:02:51.250> so<00:02:51.459> I<00:02:51.519> don't<00:02:51.700> have<00:02:51.819> to<00:02:51.940> wait

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
watch it or mine so I don't have to wait

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.900 
watch it or mine so I don't have to wait
a<00:02:52.390> few<00:02:52.690> months<00:02:52.890> for<00:02:53.890> it<00:02:54.010> to<00:02:54.129> play<00:02:54.340> because

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
a few months for it to play because

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.819 
a few months for it to play because
that's<00:02:55.230> lame<00:02:56.260> I<00:02:56.530> think<00:02:57.510> primeval<00:02:58.510> plays<00:02:58.989> on

00:02:59.819 --> 00:02:59.829 
that's lame I think primeval plays on

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:02.250 
that's lame I think primeval plays on
BBC<00:03:00.340> America<00:03:00.430> but<00:03:01.269> I<00:03:01.299> don't<00:03:01.480> know<00:03:01.629> if<00:03:01.750> they<00:03:01.900> if

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
BBC America but I don't know if they if

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.809 
BBC America but I don't know if they if
they<00:03:02.500> hear<00:03:02.709> the<00:03:02.950> new<00:03:03.069> episodes<00:03:03.519> when<00:03:03.730> they

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
they hear the new episodes when they

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.119 
they hear the new episodes when they
come<00:03:03.970> along<00:03:04.090> or<00:03:04.329> not<00:03:04.420> and<00:03:05.110> start<00:03:05.590> washing<00:03:05.799> it

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:06.129 
come along or not and start washing it

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:10.819 
come along or not and start washing it
until<00:03:06.549> it<00:03:07.030> was<00:03:07.900> already<00:03:08.230> like<00:03:09.060> on<00:03:10.060> the<00:03:10.360> off

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
until it was already like on the off

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:14.940 
until it was already like on the off
season<00:03:11.829> so<00:03:12.690> I'm<00:03:13.690> not<00:03:13.930> really<00:03:14.109> sure<00:03:14.230> but<00:03:14.530> I<00:03:14.889> do

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
season so I'm not really sure but I do

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.620 
season so I'm not really sure but I do
watch<00:03:15.280> Prime<00:03:15.700> people<00:03:16.060> I<00:03:16.120> think<00:03:16.209> it's<00:03:16.450> also

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
watch Prime people I think it's also

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.740 
watch Prime people I think it's also

curious<00:04:06.760> as<00:04:07.060> to<00:04:07.120> how<00:04:07.690> they<00:04:07.959> pick<00:04:08.410> what<00:04:09.040> shows

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459

curious as to how they pick what shows
to<00:04:09.819> play<00:04:10.150> on<00:04:10.569> BBC<00:04:11.139> America<00:04:11.200> because<00:04:12.099> you<00:04:12.340> guys

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489

because I'm very curious sometimes I get
in<00:04:53.830> the<00:04:53.889> mindset<00:04:54.370> that<00:04:55.830> everything<00:04:56.830> is<00:04:57.009> the

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
in the mindset that everything is the

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.070
