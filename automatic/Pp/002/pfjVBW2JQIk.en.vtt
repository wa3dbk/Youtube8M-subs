00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
was explaining how you don't really need

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.040 
was explaining how you don't really need
to<00:03:09.510> warm<00:03:09.720> up<00:03:09.840> is<00:03:09.959> often<00:03:10.320> anyway<00:03:10.800> battlefield<00:03:11.490> I

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
to warm up is often anyway battlefield I

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.420 
to warm up is often anyway battlefield I
mean<00:03:13.050> I<00:03:13.200> don't<00:03:13.380> really<00:03:13.530> know<00:03:13.770> what<00:03:14.010> state<00:03:14.250> I

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
mean I don't really know what state I

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.530 
mean I don't really know what state I
mean<00:03:14.700> basically<00:03:15.540> you<00:03:16.080> have<00:03:16.230> /<00:03:16.740> pool<00:03:17.450> when<00:03:18.450> you

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
mean basically you have / pool when you

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.080 
mean basically you have / pool when you
have<00:03:18.660> fox<00:03:18.990> and<00:03:19.350> a<00:03:19.650> character<00:03:20.070> vs<00:03:20.489> fox<00:03:20.730> and

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
have fox and a character vs fox and

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.360 
have fox and a character vs fox and
another<00:03:21.540> character<00:03:22.020> the<00:03:22.380> foxes<00:03:22.830> cancel<00:03:23.220> out

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
another character the foxes cancel out

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.220 
another character the foxes cancel out
so<00:03:23.880> you<00:03:23.940> pick<00:03:24.180> stages<00:03:24.600> based<00:03:24.810> on<00:03:25.020> the

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
so you pick stages based on the

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.490 
so you pick stages based on the
characters<00:03:25.620> who<00:03:25.739> arent<00:03:26.010> fox<00:03:26.160> so<00:03:26.850> I<00:03:26.910> guess

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
characters who arent fox so I guess

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
characters who arent fox so I guess
Pikachu<00:03:28.500> peaches<00:03:28.890> and<00:03:29.010> that<00:03:29.130> bad<00:03:29.310> here

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520
