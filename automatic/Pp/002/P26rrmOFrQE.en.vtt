00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:12.540
 hello friends of interesting questions 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:17.699
 He gave us a pitch in the morning, but one by one means 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:20.460
 question such a person says here we have 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.970
 Belarus says he is already there a lot 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.029
 unwound the film there agent 2011 until 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.579
 think that 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:32.100
 23 years to this film about how in america 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:35.010
 are building concentration camps then we already have lists 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:38.670
 who where and so on and here's a guide how 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.880
 The conclusion about this is thinking what I want . 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.550
 I will say let's from the general gathered first 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:47.370
 then see just ready my observation 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.740
 personal, that is, you can agree you can 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:55.820
 No but my observation is here 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:59.670
 all when we look at the press 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:02.100
 totalitarian states we of course in 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.979
 more so we are interested in this 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.649
 what you can read in Russian 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:11.369
 very aware of what they write there for example in 

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:14.880
 Iran or there I do not know in Libya there when 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.859
 Gaddafi or there somewhere else more difficult there 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.140
 get there or there in north korea which 

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:22.409
 We write here somehow in Russian more 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.050
 you are from totalitarian but are well acquainted and 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.610
 here 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:31.760
 press totalitarian states she 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:35.180
 chooses as objects of criticism 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:37.310
 that among the population of these countries we are not 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.220
 Only these countries are perceived as 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.500
 some of the line devil then sample for 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.080
 role models here let's move to that 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.630
 side so vector here let you be 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.840
 also let's say safely there I don't know 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.270
 there in holland let us also be 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.250
 economically there thriving as in 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.220
 Germany let us be the same 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.830
 free for initiative citizens like 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:06.320
 over mercedes states there and so on and so forth 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:08.950
 here's a blow to this ideal 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:12.530
 because this ideal contradicts 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.640
 totalitarian and further replaced as 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.460
 would be bad 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.430
 ideal bourgeois alien to us here 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:21.410
 elite here that is rigorism this 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.060
 true democracy and freedom and there 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.980
 some fake values ​​here 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.980
 hit on false values and 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.150
 from this a lot of people go young 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.600
 and not so young 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.370
 who pride themselves on the melancholy eyes 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.220
 the whole world is in terrible shame 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:42.709
 Generally terrible but they are guards here we are 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:45.879
 such means now of all that 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:49.549
 developed society lives 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:51.760
 something is chosen for people 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:54.519
 there is no less developed 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.709
 and then those problems that are in this 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:03:00.040
 less developed taste elite society 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:04.000
 these problems are further tolerated 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:06.670
 here there is a developed society and more 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.650
 democratic and that all for such 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.349
 people here let's say if you see 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:14.920
 a headline such a dollar crisis is inevitable 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:16.620
 what does it mean it means that with these 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.959
 who writes this in that country 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:22.689
 money problems, and what day of the game 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:25.629
 specifically their currency there ruble there hryvnia 

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:28.989
 there or there i don't know what or euro but 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:31.090
 if the blow goes this way, then this 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:32.019
 It means that they have problems with them. 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.650
 own currency 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:38.909
 if they say that they are greedy there someone 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.900
 robs it means they are at this time 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:42.519
 ruin it could be its population 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.599
 it may be wearing someone else's 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:48.970
 not its if they say that we allow 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:50.829
 they can expect a crisis or a crisis where there is a 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.840
 mean they already have a crisis or 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:56.230
 will soon be if they talk about the violation 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:58.780
 human rights there of the united states it 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.790
 does that mean they have someone planted or 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.730
 are going to land or are there tanks on 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:07.540
 Someone there for students or schoolchildren 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:09.790
 and so on about this logic 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.519
 so if melancholy twerk Russian 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.139
 follow and say that here they say in 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:16.989
 America List Compiled 

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:17.799
 read the weight prepared and live in 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.590
 Belarus 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:24.220
 Well, then what is the conclusion we do 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:27.849
 that in Belarus from cod and the place where 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:30.010
 do these people also have vodka I 

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:32.380
 when it happens if god forbid 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:35.380
 things will happen so people have everything 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.720
 It will be like here in America that is honest 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.940
 fair and democratic well here's how 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.400
 most of these democratic already have 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:45.610
 America can people in concentration camps too 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:48.520
 to us here in the partisan region and 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.520
 the more so I can have cheese in her 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.940
 but a little 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.940
 let's 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:00.629
 I am really surprised to see 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:05.970
 because it would seem propaganda such 

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:08.159
 miserable already who needs that 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:11.159
 what country need this moron 

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:11.729
 which is at face value this one 

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:13.800
 enterprise 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:15.750
 Yes, and nailed to say and we have high school-ah 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.389
 for some reason they need it 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:20.610
 It is about them that this is now but they ha 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:24.419
 let's do what for morons and why 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.800
 You are a money moron, but it means 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:29.880
 meant for some reason needed 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:31.860
 but would not should not have here but I 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.090
 I want to refer to the check that 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.449
 lives of Belarus who have this question 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:39.990
 sets I want to say that you absolutely 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:41.580
 necessary i mean you somewhere on the way i 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.130
 I understand if you were not on the way you would not 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.509
 watched our channel would be proud 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:49.259
 achievements of democracy there in Belarus 

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:51.599
 yes there are clean on the streets there are talkers 

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:51.990
 all sorts of sit in prisons and there is the 

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:53.909
 a place 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:55.740
 you are not there you are watching our channel 

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:57.449
 accordingly, you somehow some 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.219
 movement you have, too, but you do not 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:01.349
 break away from this crap you should 

00:05:59.219 --> 00:06:04.319
 stop letting 

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:06.330
 poison your mind to people the whole point 

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:08.699
 whose lives and work are 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:10.919
 you can be conscious of poisoning 

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:14.460
 must learn to quietly but if you 

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:15.539
 want to live well and want with meaning and 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:18.960
 with pleasure 

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:21.220
 live and that you must understand what 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.350
 games around are played 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:27.640
 Well, do not put a victim like this 

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:30.820
 just so I gave an example that once 

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:32.260
 there was the computer magazine 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:36.670
 such a picture 

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:39.040
 and the slogan was written don't be a road 

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:41.830
 kill all the informational super highway 

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:45.100
 that is, any vital vital animal clogged 

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:47.980
 on the road means on the information super 

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:50.290
 high you are about whether you will be not so 

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:53.080
 animal go don't be a rabbit and but 

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:55.210
 there which propaganda crushed 

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:57.970
 car moving there on the internet by 

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:59.890
 newspaper strips and so on 

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:04.020
 aside let her pass and go 

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:04.020
 in my own way I would say so happy
