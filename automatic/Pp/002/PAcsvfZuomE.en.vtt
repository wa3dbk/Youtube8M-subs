a flip that's what I can do

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.440 
a flip that's what I can do
sample<00:03:28.560> level<00:03:28.680> at<00:03:28.889> a<00:03:28.920> time<00:03:29.159> it's<00:03:29.970> just<00:03:30.030> a<00:03:30.269> poor

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
sample level at a time it's just a poor

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.140 
sample level at a time it's just a poor
man's<00:03:30.690> grill<00:03:31.340> but<00:03:32.340> it<00:03:32.459> works

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
just one of those things it's just the

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.050 
just one of those things it's just the
same<00:03:45.720> as<00:03:45.959> I<00:03:46.440> like<00:03:47.069> part<00:03:47.370> of<00:03:47.400> the<00:03:47.489> citizen<00:03:47.910> lot

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
same as I like part of the citizen lot

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.369 
same as I like part of the citizen lot
of<00:03:48.150> times<00:03:48.299> I<00:03:48.389> think<00:03:48.599> some<00:03:48.810> things<00:03:48.840> take<00:03:49.260> the

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:49.379 
of times I think some things take the

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:51.409 
of times I think some things take the
Lowestoft<00:03:49.829> mode<00:03:50.129> and<00:03:50.879> then<00:03:51.060> you<00:03:51.090> need<00:03:51.389> to

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:51.419 
Lowestoft mode and then you need to

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:55.670 
Lowestoft mode and then you need to
sizzle<00:03:52.040> the<00:03:53.040> spew<00:03:53.370> back<00:03:53.579> from<00:03:54.239> the<00:03:54.590> from<00:03:55.590> the

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
sizzle the spew back from the from the

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.830 
sizzle the spew back from the from the
codes<00:03:55.949> whether<00:03:56.340> it's<00:03:56.579> charcoal<00:03:57.239> this<00:03:57.510> isn't
