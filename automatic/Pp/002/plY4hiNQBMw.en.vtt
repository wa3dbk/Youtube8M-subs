about<00:01:15.479> their<00:01:15.630> conditions<00:01:16.110> do<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.290> think

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
about their conditions do you think

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.780

they'll affect that affect the game much
yeah<00:01:18.540> I<00:01:18.600> think<00:01:19.259> that<00:01:19.530> they<00:01:19.710> could<00:01:20.040> be<00:01:20.220> good<00:01:20.610> to

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
yeah I think that they could be good to

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.940 
yeah I think that they could be good to
think<00:01:20.880> if<00:01:21.180> they<00:01:21.270> get<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.570> ball<00:01:21.750> out<00:01:21.780> wide<00:01:22.200> yeah

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
think if they get the ball out wide yeah

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.950 
think if they get the ball out wide yeah
well<00:01:23.310> always<00:01:23.580> hard<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.090> tell<00:01:24.180> on<00:01:24.420> when<00:01:24.689> a<00:01:24.720> from

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
well always hard to tell on when a from

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.390 
well always hard to tell on when a from
what's<00:01:25.140> gonna<00:01:25.290> happen<00:01:25.590> on<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.770> day<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:26.189> trick

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
what's gonna happen on the day the trick

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.830 
what's gonna happen on the day the trick
will<00:01:26.549> be<00:01:26.580> good<00:01:26.970> but<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.390> might<00:01:27.509> be<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.689> bit

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840
