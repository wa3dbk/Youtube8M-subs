00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
be a completely different game of a

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.900 
be a completely different game of a
demanding<00:00:22.710> room<00:00:22.920> yeah<00:00:23.279> hopefully<00:00:23.550> it's<00:00:23.789> not

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
demanding room yeah hopefully it's not

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.000 
demanding room yeah hopefully it's not
after<00:00:24.600> a<00:00:24.630> lot<00:00:24.750> miss<00:00:24.960> sure<00:00:25.170> I<00:00:25.350> think<00:00:25.590> maybe<00:00:25.769> we

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
after a lot miss sure I think maybe we

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.740 
after a lot miss sure I think maybe we
performed<00:00:26.430> really<00:00:26.550> well<00:00:26.789> against<00:00:27.240> they<00:00:27.539> let

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
performed really well against they let

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.000 
performed really well against they let
me<00:00:27.810> put<00:00:27.960> with<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.140> better<00:00:28.289> team<00:00:28.590> probably

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
me put with a better team probably

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.099 
me put with a better team probably
should<00:00:29.220> have<00:00:29.279> won<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.490> game<00:00:29.929> this<00:00:30.929> is<00:00:31.080> a

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
should have won the game this is a

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.389 
should have won the game this is a
different<00:00:31.470> task<00:00:31.650> this<00:00:31.949> is<00:00:32.070> going<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.309> be<00:00:32.369> a

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
different task this is going to be a

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.030 
different task this is going to be a
tough<00:00:32.880> battle<00:00:33.149> it<00:00:33.870> will<00:00:34.020> be<00:00:34.140> better

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
tough battle it will be better

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.700 
tough battle it will be better

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
change the direction in which they

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.979 
change the direction in which they
played<00:00:41.520> but<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:42.300> seller<00:00:42.570> danger<00:00:42.899> from

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
played but the seller danger from

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.959 
played but the seller danger from
set-pieces<00:00:43.260> so<00:00:43.770> we<00:00:43.980> have<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.460> defend<00:00:44.700> better

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
set-pieces so we have to defend better

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.000 
set-pieces so we have to defend better
from<00:00:45.239> set-pieces<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.899> we<00:00:45.989> did<00:00:46.140> last<00:00:46.260> week<00:00:46.530> if

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
from set-pieces and we did last week if

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.139 
from set-pieces and we did last week if
we<00:00:47.219> can<00:00:47.430> I<00:00:47.460> think<00:00:47.730> we've<00:00:47.820> got<00:00:47.940> more<00:00:48.090> than

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
we can I think we've got more than

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.240 
we can I think we've got more than
enough<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.629> win<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:48.989> game<00:00:49.170> retaining<00:00:50.100> that

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
enough to win the game retaining that

intenders<00:01:21.150> what<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.479> was<00:01:21.600> last<00:01:21.750> week<00:01:22.020> but<00:01:22.229> we

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
intenders what it was last week but we

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.109 
intenders what it was last week but we
wanted<00:01:22.890> me<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.040> keep<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.310> concentration<00:01:23.939> if<00:01:24.030> he
