it is about it you know don't think I

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.250 
it is about it you know don't think I
don't<00:00:30.570> think<00:00:30.689> I'll<00:00:30.869> fall<00:00:31.080> into<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.439> trap<00:00:31.650> of

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
don't think I'll fall into the trap of

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.740 
don't think I'll fall into the trap of
going<00:00:34.260> into<00:00:34.700> going<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:35.820> any<00:00:36.120> game<00:00:36.270> thinking

going into going to any game thinking
the<00:00:37.170> job's<00:00:37.410> done<00:00:37.530> that's<00:00:37.860> not<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.160> case<00:00:38.309> our

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
the job's done that's not the case our

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.819 
the job's done that's not the case our
two<00:00:39.360> remaining<00:00:39.719> fixtures<00:00:40.110> are<00:00:40.350> both<00:00:40.500> against

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
two remaining fixtures are both against

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.979 
two remaining fixtures are both against
sites<00:00:41.160> who<00:00:41.520> cost<00:00:42.360> QPR<00:00:42.750> situations<00:00:43.410> been<00:00:44.989> since

sites who cost QPR situations been since

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.310 
sites who cost QPR situations been since
I<00:00:46.079> last<00:00:46.110> spoke<00:00:46.379> in<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.800> press<00:00:47.039> has<00:00:47.219> been

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
I last spoke in the press has been

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.619 
I last spoke in the press has been
altered<00:00:49.320> somewhat<00:00:49.920> but<00:00:50.219> even<00:00:50.520> then<00:00:50.700> you<00:00:50.910> know

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
altered somewhat but even then you know

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.569 
altered somewhat but even then you know
they're<00:00:52.050> games<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.530> we've<00:00:53.010> got<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.280> try<00:00:53.460> and

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
they're games that we've got to try and

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.779 
they're games that we've got to try and
get<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.789> result<00:00:54.120> right<00:00:54.270> for<00:00:54.510> us<00:00:55.489> so<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.610> course

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
get the result right for us so of course

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.099 
get the result right for us so of course
again<00:00:57.180> it's<00:00:57.420> similar<00:00:57.629> in<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.840> particular

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
again it's similar in a particular

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.709 
again it's similar in a particular
becomes<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.920> very<00:00:59.489> important<00:01:00.030> game<00:01:00.180> but<00:01:00.449> in<00:01:00.629> the

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
becomes a very important game but in the

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.619 
becomes a very important game but in the
context<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.980> season<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.489> know<00:01:02.609> it's<00:01:03.030> it

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
context of the season you know it's it

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.509 
context of the season you know it's it
remains<00:01:03.989> very<00:01:04.170> much<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.680> similar<00:01:05.100> sort<00:01:05.280> of<00:01:05.369> a

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
remains very much a similar sort of a

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.890 
remains very much a similar sort of a
message<00:01:05.939> in<00:01:06.240> that<00:01:06.360> is<00:01:06.570> that<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:08.270> we<00:01:09.270> want<00:01:09.659> it

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
message in that is that that we want it

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.570 
message in that is that that we want it
to<00:01:10.500> be<00:01:10.619> in<00:01:10.680> our<00:01:10.799> own<00:01:10.890> hands<00:01:11.900> and<00:01:13.159> this<00:01:14.159> grips<00:01:14.430> is

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
to be in our own hands and this grips is

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.920 
to be in our own hands and this grips is
another<00:01:14.909> opportunity<00:01:15.360> but<00:01:15.479> it'd<00:01:15.570> be<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.720> tough

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
another opportunity but it'd be a tough

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
another opportunity but it'd be a tough
game<00:01:16.140> for<00:01:16.200> us<00:01:26.090> we'll<00:01:27.090> see<00:01:27.330> when<00:01:27.509> we<00:01:33.950> don't

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
game for us we'll see when we don't

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.340 
game for us we'll see when we don't
think<00:01:35.250> these<00:01:35.549> days<00:01:35.820> you<00:01:36.000> can<00:01:36.150> get<00:01:36.270> away<00:01:36.540> from

you<00:02:08.009> know<00:02:08.160> when<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.090> becomes<00:02:10.310> probably<00:02:11.310> more

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
you know when it becomes probably more

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.010 
you know when it becomes probably more
relevant<00:02:12.030> with<00:02:12.209> last

there<00:02:59.700> is<00:02:59.820> that<00:03:00.060> there<00:03:01.020> is<00:03:01.170> that<00:03:01.320> element<00:03:01.500> of

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
there is that there is that element of
