00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
bronzer in the other shade so I just

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.420 
bronzer in the other shade so I just
figured<00:04:37.199> out<00:04:37.439> we<00:04:37.530> get<00:04:37.680> to<00:04:37.770> do<00:04:37.949> because<00:04:38.129> it<00:04:38.340> was

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
figured out we get to do because it was

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.189 
figured out we get to do because it was
actually<00:04:38.759> cheaper<00:04:39.150> than<00:04:39.270> to<00:04:39.449> get<00:04:39.599> just<00:04:39.810> one

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:40.199 
actually cheaper than to get just one

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:42.830 
actually cheaper than to get just one
thing<00:04:40.669> plus<00:04:41.669> you<00:04:42.030> know<00:04:42.150> you<00:04:42.210> can<00:04:42.419> only<00:04:42.599> have

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
thing plus you know you can only have

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.080 
thing plus you know you can only have
like<00:04:43.050> three<00:04:43.439> add-ons<00:04:43.860> I<00:04:43.979> think<00:04:44.219> so<00:04:44.460> that<00:04:44.909> way<00:04:45.030> i

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
like three add-ons I think so that way i

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.399 
like three add-ons I think so that way i
would<00:04:45.240> get<00:04:45.360> two<00:04:45.509> products<00:04:45.930> because<00:04:46.139> i<00:04:46.259> can

00:04:46.399 --> 00:04:46.409 
would get two products because i can

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:48.020 
would get two products because i can
just<00:04:46.530> like<00:04:46.680> solve<00:04:46.949> the<00:04:47.189> blush<00:04:47.520> or<00:04:47.789> whatever

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
just like solve the blush or whatever

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.180 
just like solve the blush or whatever
you<00:04:48.599> know<00:04:48.629> because<00:04:48.840> i<00:04:48.930> have<00:04:48.960> to<00:04:49.319> so<00:04:49.650> this

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
you know because i have to so this

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.540 
you know because i have to so this
bronzer<00:04:50.789> is<00:04:50.969> in<00:04:51.270> like<00:04:51.960> gold<00:04:52.259> and<00:04:52.379> bronze<00:04:52.650> so<00:04:53.430> it

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
bronzer is in like gold and bronze so it

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.550 
bronzer is in like gold and bronze so it
looks<00:04:53.580> like<00:04:53.789> this<00:04:54.120> and<00:04:54.419> so<00:04:54.719> let<00:04:54.840> me<00:04:54.960> compare<00:04:55.379> it

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
looks like this and so let me compare it

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.990 
looks like this and so let me compare it
to<00:04:55.949> the<00:04:56.330> medium<00:04:57.330> dark<00:04:58.050> or<00:04:58.289> whatever<00:04:58.550> so<00:04:59.550> this

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
to the medium dark or whatever so this

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.909 
to the medium dark or whatever so this
is<00:05:00.030> medium<00:05:00.569> tan<00:05:00.900> and<00:05:01.199> then<00:05:01.349> this<00:05:01.560> is<00:05:01.710> light

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 
is medium tan and then this is light

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:04.430 
is medium tan and then this is light
golden<00:05:02.370> bronze<00:05:02.780> so<00:05:03.780> that's<00:05:03.990> what<00:05:04.169> they<00:05:04.289> look

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
golden bronze so that's what they look

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.050 
golden bronze so that's what they look
like<00:05:04.469> compared<00:05:05.159> I<00:05:05.310> feel<00:05:05.490> like<00:05:05.580> this<00:05:05.759> one<00:05:05.940> is

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
like compared I feel like this one is

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.059 
like compared I feel like this one is
just<00:05:06.090> a<00:05:06.330> little<00:05:06.539> bit<00:05:06.690> warmer<00:05:07.229> and<00:05:07.710> this<00:05:07.860> one's

00:05:08.059 --> 00:05:08.069 
just a little bit warmer and this one's

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:09.769 
just a little bit warmer and this one's
cooler<00:05:08.520> not<00:05:08.759> the<00:05:08.879> one<00:05:09.029> is<00:05:09.150> like<00:05:09.300> a<00:05:09.330> darker<00:05:09.719> or

00:05:09.769 --> 00:05:09.779 
cooler not the one is like a darker or

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:11.600 
cooler not the one is like a darker or
anything<00:05:10.169> I<00:05:10.379> really<00:05:10.770> love<00:05:10.919> the<00:05:11.009> compact<00:05:11.400> out
