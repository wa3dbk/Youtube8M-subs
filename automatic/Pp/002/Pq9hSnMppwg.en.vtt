00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:09.160
 Good good 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.790
 Yonezawa Chuo High School is getting better and better 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:15.410
 Ah 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:20.529
 The players figure to address is not and iq practice willing to lose 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.529
 I can feel the confidence I have put up so hard practice 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:35.560
 A pair of ace pitchers etc. Plays tenaciously anyway, both public and private 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:37.200
 Orthodox baseball is the feature of this year's Central High School 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.770
 Nesting organization 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.540
 But money and effort 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.390
 Make a relationship 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.520
 Type of guitar 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:51.350
 Let alone to Bi Su 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:53.990
 The defensive power is also coming up here, so I can really calculate the viewpoint 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:59.920
 I feel like I am 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:59.920
 The strike line has the power to be able to wake up seamlessly from anywhere 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:08.620
 The change in physical fitness maintenance of the player is beginning to appear by taking in predatory during practice from last fall 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:13.720
 I will 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:15.590
 There is also a due team that can create the atmosphere from them. 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:20.250
 After that 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:22.050
 It's still saying that nobody can do what anyone can do 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:27.030
 Team's 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:31.420
 Because it is also a motto, I think that no such team will lose 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.950
 Than it is the last tournament for the third year 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.150
 Do not leave regrets 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.220
 I want to do my best 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.659

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:43.869
 All Australian win 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:46.580
 Anyway , I work hard every day with an image to play in Koshien which is the goal 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:50.620
 Even if you are 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:53.840
 I think it seems like I want to let you poke off 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:58.840
 After you come up to this spirit fee a 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.840
 The Koshien Tarahito Tsude aim to one race victory watchword 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:05.680
