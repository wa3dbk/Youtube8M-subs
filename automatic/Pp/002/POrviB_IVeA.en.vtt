but<00:01:28.650> what<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.890> tentacle<00:01:29.280> is<00:01:29.400> just<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.119> case

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
but what the tentacle is just the case

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.280 
but what the tentacle is just the case
i'm<00:01:31.470> going<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.740> be<00:01:31.829> using<00:01:32.810> range<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:34.110> deal<00:01:34.259> a

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
i'm going to be using range to deal a

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.870 
i'm going to be using range to deal a

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
lot of damage to them so the damage

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.899 
lot of damage to them so the damage
increases<00:01:36.390> over<00:01:36.810> time<00:01:37.430> possibly<00:01:38.430> giving<00:01:38.820> me

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
increases over time possibly giving me

in between wave i think it's 23 and
onwards<00:03:47.230> to<00:03:48.510> 28<00:03:49.510> which<00:03:50.080> 28<00:03:50.530> is<00:03:50.650> the<00:03:50.770> dill<00:03:50.980> round

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220
