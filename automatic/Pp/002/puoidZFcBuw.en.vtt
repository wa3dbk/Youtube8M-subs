the<00:00:36.630> reason<00:00:36.870> why<00:00:36.960> I<00:00:36.989> was<00:00:37.170> saving<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.590> story<00:00:37.860> is

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
the reason why I was saving the story is

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.560 
the reason why I was saving the story is
because<00:00:38.250> this<00:00:38.370> is<00:00:38.520> more<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.910> fail<00:00:39.210> story

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
because this is more of a fail story

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.660 
because this is more of a fail story
than<00:00:39.809> an<00:00:39.899> excitement<00:00:40.290> story<00:00:40.739> it's<00:00:41.520> going<00:00:41.640> to

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
than an excitement story it's going to

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.280 
than an excitement story it's going to
be<00:00:41.760> kind<00:00:41.910> of<00:00:42.030> it<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.420> mean<00:00:42.629> it's<00:00:42.750> interesting<00:00:42.960> in

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
be kind of it I mean it's interesting in

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.660 
be kind of it I mean it's interesting in
its<00:00:43.410> own<00:00:43.469> respect<00:00:43.920> but<00:00:44.070> it's<00:00:44.190> definitely<00:00:44.399> not

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
its own respect but it's definitely not

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.240 
its own respect but it's definitely not
as<00:00:44.850> epic<00:00:45.030> as<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:46.050> mailman<00:00:46.469> one<00:00:46.680> was<00:00:46.890> because

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
as epic as a the mailman one was because

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.190 
as epic as a the mailman one was because
I<00:00:47.280> think<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:47.640> mailman<00:00:47.850> got<00:00:48.270> his<00:00:48.450> what<00:00:49.079> he

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
I think that mailman got his what he

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.459 
I think that mailman got his what he
deserved<00:00:49.620> so<00:00:50.660> far<00:00:51.660> as<00:00:51.809> like<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:51.960> sixth<00:00:52.350> episode

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
deserved so far as like a sixth episode

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.949 
away because I we think that he may have
given<00:04:20.190> us<00:04:20.400> a<00:04:20.519> fake<00:04:20.729> name<00:04:20.940> so<00:04:21.630> for<00:04:21.840> all

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:27.230 
predator is Kevin for not Kevin
Christian<00:04:25.770> for<00:04:25.979> the<00:04:26.039> time<00:04:26.220> being<00:04:26.490> sometimes<00:04:27.180> I

picks a really weird time he picks like

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:52.519 
picks a really weird time he picks like
um<00:05:49.080> I<00:05:49.349> think<00:05:49.409> it<00:05:49.710> was<00:05:49.919> like<00:05:50.930> 945<00:05:51.930> on<00:05:52.289> like<00:05:52.500> a

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:52.529 
um I think it was like 945 on like a

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:55.249 
um I think it was like 945 on like a
Sunday<00:05:53.069> night<00:05:53.310> which<00:05:54.089> is<00:05:54.240> weird<00:05:54.539> because<00:05:54.810> I

00:05:55.249 --> 00:05:55.259 
Sunday night which is weird because I

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:57.140 
Sunday night which is weird because I
think<00:05:55.409> if<00:05:55.710> he's<00:05:55.860> going<00:05:56.099> after<00:05:56.310> a<00:05:56.520> younger<00:05:56.909> girl

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.150 
think if he's going after a younger girl

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.059 
think if he's going after a younger girl
perhaps<00:05:57.569> maybe<00:05:57.990> that<00:05:58.259> isn't<00:05:58.409> the<00:05:58.589> best<00:05:58.800> time

00:05:59.059 --> 00:05:59.069 
perhaps maybe that isn't the best time

00:05:59.069 --> 00:06:01.459 
perhaps maybe that isn't the best time
so<00:05:59.909> we<00:06:00.029> decide<00:06:00.360> that<00:06:00.389> we're<00:06:00.870> going<00:06:01.139> we're

00:06:47.939 --> 00:06:47.949 
apparently he was actually proactive and

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:51.359 
apparently he was actually proactive and
actually<00:06:48.520> reversed<00:06:49.830> pranked<00:06:50.830> us<00:06:50.919> I<00:06:51.069> guess<00:06:51.129> you

00:06:51.359 --> 00:06:51.369

and<00:06:54.099> was<00:06:54.249> spooked<00:06:54.519> by<00:06:54.639> the<00:06:54.729> fact<00:06:54.999> that<00:06:55.119> we<00:06:55.300> were

00:06:55.379 --> 00:06:55.389 
and was spooked by the fact that we were

00:06:55.389 --> 00:06:58.169 
and was spooked by the fact that we were
standing<00:06:55.869> around<00:06:56.199> waiting<00:06:56.759> I'm<00:06:57.759> not<00:06:57.969> saying

00:06:58.169 --> 00:06:58.179 
standing around waiting I'm not saying

00:06:58.179 --> 00:06:59.579 
standing around waiting I'm not saying
that<00:06:58.419> we<00:06:58.449> were<00:06:58.599> the<00:06:58.629> world's<00:06:59.080> like<00:06:59.289> best

00:06:59.579 --> 00:06:59.589 
that we were the world's like best

00:06:59.589 --> 00:07:01.259 
that we were the world's like best
detectives<00:07:00.189> when<00:07:00.339> it<00:07:00.429> comes<00:07:00.610> to<00:07:00.789> trying<00:07:01.089> to

00:07:01.259 --> 00:07:01.269 
detectives when it comes to trying to

00:07:01.269 --> 00:07:02.879 
detectives when it comes to trying to
catch<00:07:01.479> predators<00:07:01.719> but<00:07:02.110> I<00:07:02.169> think<00:07:02.439> what<00:07:02.589> we<00:07:02.709> did

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:02.889 
catch predators but I think what we did

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:04.619 
catch predators but I think what we did
was<00:07:03.099> is<00:07:03.279> maybe<00:07:03.849> we<00:07:04.059> were<00:07:04.119> a<00:07:04.149> little<00:07:04.239> bit<00:07:04.509> too

00:07:04.619 --> 00:07:04.629 
was is maybe we were a little bit too

00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:06.269 
was is maybe we were a little bit too
obvious<00:07:05.080> that<00:07:05.289> we<00:07:05.379> were<00:07:05.469> looking<00:07:05.499> for<00:07:05.860> someone

00:07:06.269 --> 00:07:06.279 
obvious that we were looking for someone

00:07:06.279 --> 00:07:07.889 
obvious that we were looking for someone
I<00:07:06.459> think<00:07:06.969> that<00:07:07.089> might<00:07:07.239> have<00:07:07.269> spooked<00:07:07.569> him<00:07:07.659> off

00:07:07.889 --> 00:07:07.899 
I think that might have spooked him off

00:07:07.899 --> 00:07:10.769 
I think that might have spooked him off
now<00:07:08.489> the<00:07:09.489> kicker<00:07:09.939> did<00:07:10.119> this<00:07:10.209> whole<00:07:10.419> story<00:07:10.629> is

00:07:10.769 --> 00:07:10.779 
now the kicker did this whole story is

00:07:10.779 --> 00:07:12.719 
now the kicker did this whole story is
it<00:07:10.989> turns<00:07:11.199> out<00:07:11.349> that<00:07:11.409> he<00:07:11.860> was<00:07:11.979> actually<00:07:12.009> not<00:07:12.580> at

00:07:12.719 --> 00:07:12.729 
it turns out that he was actually not at

00:07:12.729 --> 00:07:14.249 
it turns out that he was actually not at
all<00:07:12.879> like<00:07:13.149> the<00:07:13.179> guy<00:07:13.389> in<00:07:13.539> the<00:07:13.629> picture<00:07:13.929> he<00:07:14.139> was

00:07:14.249 --> 00:07:14.259 
all like the guy in the picture he was

00:07:14.259 --> 00:07:16.829 
all like the guy in the picture he was
actually<00:07:14.469> um<00:07:14.969> he<00:07:15.969> actually<00:07:16.149> was<00:07:16.449> pretty

00:07:16.829 --> 00:07:16.839 
actually um he actually was pretty

00:07:16.839 --> 00:07:18.989 
actually um he actually was pretty
hideous<00:07:17.050> and<00:07:17.379> he<00:07:17.469> was<00:07:17.589> rather<00:07:18.069> heavy<00:07:18.369> set<00:07:18.699> so

00:07:18.989 --> 00:07:18.999 
hideous and he was rather heavy set so

00:07:18.999 --> 00:07:21.809 
hideous and he was rather heavy set so
um<00:07:19.209> he<00:07:20.169> was<00:07:20.319> smart<00:07:20.559> though<00:07:20.769> he<00:07:21.009> reversed

00:07:21.809 --> 00:07:21.819 
um he was smart though he reversed

00:07:21.819 --> 00:07:23.339 
um he was smart though he reversed
pranked<00:07:22.149> us<00:07:22.240> and<00:07:22.479> it<00:07:22.539> was<00:07:22.659> actually<00:07:22.809> a<00:07:23.019> failed

00:07:23.339 --> 00:07:23.349
