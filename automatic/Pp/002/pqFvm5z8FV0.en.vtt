00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
can't find a stable server i thought

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.749 
can't find a stable server i thought
might<00:01:16.229> as<00:01:16.350> well<00:01:16.530> at<00:01:16.829> least<00:01:17.009> put<00:01:17.340> something<00:01:17.670> on

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
might as well at least put something on

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.270 
might as well at least put something on
so<00:01:18.240> i<00:01:18.299> can<00:01:18.450> explain<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:19.200> well<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.130> more

classes but on the other team so if

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.620 
classes but on the other team so if
you're<00:02:19.800> blue<00:02:20.010> you'd<00:02:20.310> be<00:02:20.520> a<00:02:20.700> red<00:02:21.000> spy<00:02:21.330> or<00:02:21.570> you

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
you're blue you'd be a red spy or you

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.060 
you're blue you'd be a red spy or you
could<00:02:21.750> be<00:02:21.840> a<00:02:21.870> red<00:02:22.110> Scout<00:02:22.410> or<00:02:22.590> anything<00:02:22.950> you<00:02:23.010> can

could be a red Scout or anything you can
just<00:02:23.280> turn<00:02:23.430> it<00:02:23.610> any<00:02:23.730> league

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
just turn it any league

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:25.770 
just turn it any league
10<00:02:24.370> and<00:02:24.670> they<00:02:25.030> can<00:02:25.239> just<00:02:25.420> wander<00:02:25.599> around

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
10 and they can just wander around

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.289 
10 and they can just wander around
hopefully<00:02:26.319> unnoticed<00:02:27.159> budget<00:02:27.609> it<00:02:27.849> is<00:02:28.209> the

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:28.299 
hopefully unnoticed budget it is the

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:29.970 
hopefully unnoticed budget it is the
type<00:02:28.480> of<00:02:28.510> thing<00:02:28.780> that<00:02:28.810> most<00:02:29.109> people<00:02:29.230> can<00:02:29.620> tend

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
type of thing that most people can tend

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.039 
type of thing that most people can tend
to<00:02:30.099> spot<00:02:30.340> a<00:02:30.370> spy<00:02:30.670> unless<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.389> people<00:02:31.749> who<00:02:31.959> were

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
to spot a spy unless the people who were

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:33.750 
to spot a spy unless the people who were
playing<00:02:32.200> us<00:02:32.409> some<00:02:32.499> very<00:02:32.560> good<00:02:33.040> so<00:02:33.579> you'll

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
playing us some very good so you'll

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:34.949 
playing us some very good so you'll
probably<00:02:33.849> end<00:02:34.090> up<00:02:34.209> getting<00:02:34.450> shot<00:02:34.480> down<00:02:34.749> with

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
probably end up getting shot down with

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:36.149 
probably end up getting shot down with
them<00:02:35.049> I<00:02:35.170> definitely<00:02:35.530> think<00:02:35.739> the<00:02:35.889> spy<00:02:36.099> is

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:36.159 
them I definitely think the spy is

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:38.160 
them I definitely think the spy is
possibly<00:02:36.670> the<00:02:36.760> most<00:02:36.849> expert<00:02:37.510> of<00:02:37.599> classes<00:02:38.019> as

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
possibly the most expert of classes as

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.530 
possibly the most expert of classes as
in<00:02:38.680> you've<00:02:38.980> got<00:02:39.219> to<00:02:39.310> be<00:02:39.400> bloody<00:02:39.819> good<00:02:40.120> to<00:02:40.420> play

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
in you've got to be bloody good to play

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.770 
in you've got to be bloody good to play
as<00:02:40.659> a<00:02:40.750> spy<00:02:41.099> so<00:02:42.099> anyway<00:02:42.639> that's<00:02:43.269> basically<00:02:43.659> all

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
as a spy so anyway that's basically all

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.289 
as a spy so anyway that's basically all
them<00:02:44.079> then<00:02:44.620> you<00:02:44.920> just<00:02:45.129> actually<00:02:45.310> well<00:02:45.939> after

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
them then you just actually well after

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:47.490 
them then you just actually well after
you<00:02:46.389> choose<00:02:46.540> a<00:02:46.569> class<00:02:46.780> of<00:02:46.870> tea<00:02:47.139> the<00:02:47.319> game

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
you choose a class of tea the game

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.809 
you choose a class of tea the game
starts<00:02:47.920> on<00:02:48.010> that<00:02:48.159> and<00:02:48.400> there's<00:02:48.519> different

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
starts on that and there's different

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:50.699 
starts on that and there's different
gameplay<00:02:49.180> modes<00:02:49.450> but<00:02:50.019> you've<00:02:50.260> basically<00:02:50.439> got

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
gameplay modes but you've basically got

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.039 
gameplay modes but you've basically got
ups<00:02:51.639> on<00:02:51.849> a<00:02:51.879> lot<00:02:52.090> of<00:02:52.209> them<00:02:52.359> and<00:02:52.659> you<00:02:52.780> can<00:02:52.930> like

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
ups on a lot of them and you can like

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:55.110 
ups on a lot of them and you can like
view<00:02:53.799> things<00:02:54.129> or<00:02:54.249> not<00:02:54.340> you<00:02:54.459> can<00:02:54.609> go<00:02:54.790> back<00:02:55.090> to

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
view things or not you can go back to

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.789 
view things or not you can go back to
your<00:02:55.269> beers<00:02:55.480> to<00:02:55.689> get<00:02:55.810> healed<00:02:56.109> or<00:02:56.379> get<00:02:56.590> hammer

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
your beers to get healed or get hammer

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:59.520 
your beers to get healed or get hammer
and<00:02:57.129> stuff<00:02:57.400> but<00:02:58.239> the<00:02:58.629> gameplay<00:02:58.900> types<00:02:59.290> are

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
and stuff but the gameplay types are

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.470 
and stuff but the gameplay types are
capture<00:03:00.370> the<00:03:00.459> flag<00:03:00.639> which<00:03:01.000> is<00:03:01.150> basically

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
capture the flag which is basically

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.000 
capture the flag which is basically
capture<00:03:01.930> the<00:03:02.019> flag<00:03:02.199> but<00:03:02.469> obviously<00:03:02.769> you<00:03:02.889> have

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
capture the flag but obviously you have

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.610 
capture the flag but obviously you have
to<00:03:03.129> actually<00:03:03.280> capture<00:03:03.669> well<00:03:04.599> a<00:03:04.900> briefcase<00:03:05.290> of

capturing<00:03:18.790> like<00:03:19.510> all<00:03:20.019> the<00:03:20.290> points<00:03:20.469> on<00:03:20.709> the<00:03:20.799> map

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
capturing like all the points on the map

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:24.360 
capturing like all the points on the map
and<00:03:21.719> then<00:03:22.719> this<00:03:22.959> arena<00:03:23.439> which<00:03:23.829> is<00:03:23.980> basically<00:03:24.250> a

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
and then this arena which is basically a

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.949 
and then this arena which is basically a
team<00:03:24.579> deathmatch<00:03:25.030> but<00:03:25.269> you<00:03:25.389> only<00:03:25.510> actually

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
team deathmatch but you only actually

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:27.990 
team deathmatch but you only actually
get<00:03:26.109> one<00:03:26.409> life<00:03:26.650> and<00:03:26.949> that's<00:03:27.129> it<00:03:27.310> you<00:03:27.459> die<00:03:27.639> and

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
get one life and that's it you die and

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.580 
get one life and that's it you die and
then<00:03:28.150> you<00:03:28.750> have<00:03:28.840> to<00:03:28.959> wear<00:03:29.109> it<00:03:29.199> to<00:03:29.290> the<00:03:29.319> end<00:03:29.500> of

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
then you have to wear it to the end of

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:30.649 
then you have to wear it to the end of
the<00:03:29.650> round<00:03:29.769> before<00:03:30.009> you<00:03:30.189> can<00:03:30.310> respawn

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:30.659
