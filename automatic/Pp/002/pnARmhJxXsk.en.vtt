00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.420

 of post with 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.049
 in the table and therefore these are 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.530
 perfect because they are abnormal 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:08.899

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.580

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:51.860

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:54.019

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.930
 video the review on the pancake though 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:03.019
 a little more complicated because I have to put 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.730
 on the stove so I hope my words can 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:11.900
 also that will make you the review 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:18.320

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:26.000
 Todi catch up fine are also great that 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:30.230
 nice i am that normal though it is 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:33.590
 very spicy they immediately feel the spices 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.840
 at the beginning ketchup is heard and then yes 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.640
 just feel the meat just that 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.709
 screech here all feel good 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.440
 ingredients I do n't know that kind of 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:47.410
 zucchini ct role that there is ketchup here 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.410
 which is usually placed over the meat 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:57.069
 I really like monet then they 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:57.069
 they are also many 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.130
 ok i made the pancake came nice 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.020
 now the tasting with you 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.849
 anyway I wanted to say that all the others 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.760
 things that I bought I will not do 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:16.380
 see while tasting like 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:18.510
 the burger the raki cream of not 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.370
 see why they are things you find 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.750
 however everywhere you can and that 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.020
 you have certainly already tasted too 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.580
 you do nicer things like le 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.960
 but other fries you have to wait 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.610
 because I did not want to do so alone 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.990
 I wait for my friends to come to the sea 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:38.220
 with me to make videos with their internships 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:41.010
 what the video then comes these 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:43.650
 pancake is not cute in the beautiful 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:50.300
 second but now I try it to taste 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:50.300
 with you or even burns a piece 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.820
 it's practically a dust inside those 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.250
 rejected that I showed before 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:05.570
 400 ml of milk must be added 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:07.430
 move well and then put them in the pan and 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.580
 he will tell you that I didn't expect it like that 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.050
 good now there is nothing on it 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:15.070
 think of it as nutella 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:20.530
 my uncle then you can put on honey 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:22.880
 maple syrup you like them 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:24.310

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:29.110
 liked and kept them company 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:29.110
