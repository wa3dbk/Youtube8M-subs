00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
prepared so we knew that we needed to

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.160 
prepared so we knew that we needed to
trust<00:01:53.429> our<00:01:53.639> training<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.299> allow<00:01:54.719> our<00:01:54.869> bodies

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
trust our training and allow our bodies

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.440 
trust our training and allow our bodies
to<00:01:55.380> sort<00:01:55.590> of<00:01:55.619> go<00:01:55.770> on<00:01:55.799> autopilot<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.819> part<00:01:57.389> of

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
to sort of go on autopilot and part of

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.120 
to sort of go on autopilot and part of
that<00:01:57.569> is<00:01:57.780> staying<00:01:58.109> relaxed<00:01:58.619> trying<00:01:58.859> to<00:01:58.920> stay

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
that is staying relaxed trying to stay

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.340 
that is staying relaxed trying to stay
loose<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.729> that's<00:02:00.090> easier<00:02:00.450> said<00:02:00.509> than<00:02:00.840> done

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
loose and that's easier said than done

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.440 
loose and that's easier said than done
so<00:02:01.439> we<00:02:02.280> tried<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.549> remind<00:02:02.760> ourselves<00:02:02.939> just
