00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.310
 This time I will introduce you to Aprica's Koran Hug. 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:06.480
 The main feature of this series is 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.000
 The point is that it can be used long in five styles. 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.550
 First, I used this separately sold exclusive newborn baby seat for the baby in front of my neck 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.000
 We recommend horizontal hug. 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:23.200
 It is easy to use. 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.000
 First, we will spread the baby band. 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.400
 And as the baby's head comes to the left side of the newborn baby seat sold separately 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.000
 I put it on the baby band. 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.060
 The belt hook attached to this part of the newborn seat 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.000
 Fasten to the waist belt hook of the baby belt. 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.360
 Shoulder buckle attached to this part of baby carrier 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.000
 Fasten to the buckle on the head of the newborn seat. 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.000
 At that time, adjust the length so that there is no excess of the belt. 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.840
 Attached to the other side of the buckle attached earlier, this newborn seat buckle 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.000
 Fasten to the shoulder buckles of the baby belt so that there is no twist. 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.000
 The foot side does the same operation. 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 After that, let the baby sleep in this way and stop this waist belt. 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 Next, stop the waist belt for moms, 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.000
 Through the shoulders 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.000
 Finish the buckle on the back to complete. 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.290
 Next, from about 4 months of neck rest to "vertical hug." 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.600
 First, let your baby sleep 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.000
 Don't forget to install this "Ombu Harness". 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.000
 Stop the mother's waist belt, 

00:02:20.529 --> 00:02:22.059
 Through the shoulder 

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:25.000
 It is easy to install just to stop the back buckle. 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:33.500
 About 7 months when you can sit alone "Positive!" 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:41.000
 In addition, you can also do a handy "Dhip" when you want to hug a little. 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 In addition, you can also make a big success for housework from the four months when the neck is closed. 

00:02:48.529 --> 00:02:50.059
 In addition grade 

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:53.000
