00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
well it almost kind of takes a phrase

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.490 
well it almost kind of takes a phrase
because<00:00:42.489> it's<00:00:42.670> so<00:00:42.850> hard<00:00:43.090> to<00:00:43.180> pass<00:00:43.300> it<00:00:43.540> on<00:00:43.690> so

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
because it's so hard to pass it on so

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.680 
because it's so hard to pass it on so
this<00:00:44.739> is<00:00:44.920> crucial<00:00:45.160> this<00:00:45.460> is<00:00:45.610> critical<00:00:46.030> it's
