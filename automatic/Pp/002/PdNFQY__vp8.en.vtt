00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.100 
the reason why I put the numbers is
because<00:01:51.600> i<00:01:52.460> usually<00:01:53.460> make<00:01:53.780> since<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.900> first

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
because i usually make since the first

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.540 
because i usually make since the first
time<00:01:55.290> i<00:01:55.440> narrate<00:01:55.890> so<00:01:56.070> that's<00:01:56.250> why<00:01:56.400> I'm<00:01:56.520> making

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 
time i narrate so that's why I'm making

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.970 
time i narrate so that's why I'm making
it<00:01:56.910> at<00:01:57.120> a<00:01:57.420> lower<00:01:57.780> speed<00:01:57.960> but<00:01:58.530> i<00:01:58.560> usually<00:01:58.740> make

00:01:58.970 --> 00:01:58.980 
it at a lower speed but i usually make

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.450 
it at a lower speed but i usually make
my<00:01:59.250> battles<00:01:59.820> at<00:01:59.940> times<00:02:00.570> 3<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.260> speed<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.860> put

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
my battles at times 3 the speed and put

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.240 
my battles at times 3 the speed and put
some<00:02:02.580> music<00:02:02.700> or<00:02:03.030> something<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.800> i<00:02:04.800> look<00:02:05.010> back

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
some music or something and i look back

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.600 
some music or something and i look back
i<00:02:05.280> think<00:02:05.760> my<00:02:06.060> three<00:02:06.870> first<00:02:07.110> battles<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:07.830> they

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
i think my three first battles and they

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.900 
i think my three first battles and they
don't<00:02:08.670> have<00:02:08.910> them<00:02:09.090> there<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:10.220> i<00:02:11.220> use<00:02:11.460> what

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
don't have them there and i use what

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.580 
don't have them there and i use what
wash<00:02:12.270> them<00:02:12.510> and<00:02:12.540> i<00:02:12.780> thought<00:02:12.930> it<00:02:13.080> was<00:02:13.200> going<00:02:13.350> too

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
wash them and i thought it was going too

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.730 
wash them and i thought it was going too
fast<00:02:13.620> and<00:02:14.520> so<00:02:15.180> I<00:02:15.240> wanted<00:02:15.510> to<00:02:15.660> make<00:02:15.750> sure<00:02:15.900> the

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
fast and so I wanted to make sure the

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.300 
fast and so I wanted to make sure the
debut<00:02:17.520> were<00:02:17.700> knew<00:02:17.940> what<00:02:18.210> was<00:02:18.300> happening<00:02:18.360> and<00:02:19.310> I

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
debut were knew what was happening and I

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.460 
debut were knew what was happening and I
believe<00:02:20.550> the<00:02:20.670> numbers<00:02:20.970> help<00:02:21.209> and<00:02:21.420> they<00:02:22.290> bake

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
believe the numbers help and they bake

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.610 
believe the numbers help and they bake
the<00:02:22.800> battle<00:02:23.070> more<00:02:23.220> interesting<00:02:24.470> like<00:02:25.470> for

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
the battle more interesting like for

combat<00:04:04.070> which<00:04:04.910> once<00:04:05.150> was<00:04:05.270> meant<00:04:05.750> for

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
combat which once was meant for

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.949 
combat which once was meant for
tyranitar<00:04:06.560> but<00:04:07.340> he<00:04:07.520> switches<00:04:07.760> to<00:04:08.000> the<00:04:08.030> Celebi

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.990 

and<00:04:11.959> I'm<00:04:12.230> thinking<00:04:12.260> he<00:04:13.130> is<00:04:13.430> gonna<00:04:13.730> try<00:04:13.940> to

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
and I'm thinking he is gonna try to

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.780 
and I'm thinking he is gonna try to
stall<00:04:14.540> my<00:04:16.660> information<00:04:17.660> like<00:04:18.500> orb<00:04:18.890> and<00:04:19.130> sand

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790 
stall my information like orb and sand

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.000 
stall my information like orb and sand
storm<00:04:20.060> damage<00:04:20.450> so<00:04:20.989> here<00:04:21.260> I<00:04:21.290> think<00:04:21.709> he's<00:04:21.859> going

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
storm damage so here I think he's going

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.220 
storm damage so here I think he's going
to<00:04:22.100> switch<00:04:22.340> back<00:04:23.300> to<00:04:23.360> the<00:04:23.540> redditor<00:04:24.020> that's

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.230 
to switch back to the redditor that's

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:30.450 
to switch back to the redditor that's
why<00:04:24.380> i<00:04:24.410> use<00:04:24.590> close<00:04:24.860> combat<00:04:25.130> /<00:04:25.430> hughes<00:04:25.700> protect

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.710 

so<00:04:31.460> i<00:04:31.490> don't<00:04:31.730> know<00:04:31.820> what<00:04:32.000> he's<00:04:32.180> gonna<00:04:32.330> do<00:04:32.540> now

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
so i don't know what he's gonna do now

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.430 
so i don't know what he's gonna do now
it'll<00:04:33.050> switch<00:04:33.440> or<00:04:33.680> no<00:04:33.830> but<00:04:34.100> I<00:04:34.250> I<00:04:34.640> got<00:04:35.060> it<00:04:35.180> right

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
it'll switch or no but I I got it right

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.750 
it'll switch or no but I I got it right
he<00:04:36.440> could<00:04:36.620> have<00:04:36.740> switched<00:04:37.040> back<00:04:37.340> to<00:04:37.370> Tehran

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
he could have switched back to Tehran

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.520 
he could have switched back to Tehran
eater<00:04:38.030> but<00:04:38.240> this<00:04:38.390> was<00:04:38.540> a<00:04:38.570> very<00:04:38.870> decisive

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
eater but this was a very decisive

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.920 
eater but this was a very decisive
moment<00:04:39.890> he<00:04:39.980> could<00:04:40.130> have<00:04:40.310> gone<00:04:40.550> either<00:04:40.580> way<00:04:40.930> but

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
moment he could have gone either way but

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.210 
moment he could have gone either way but
I<00:04:41.990> use<00:04:42.200> flamethrower<00:04:42.470> and<00:04:42.980> luckily<00:04:43.310> he<00:04:43.880> stayed
