will push back at you as the wheel
rotates<00:01:20.540> into<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.630> pads<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.619> have<00:01:22.830> them

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
rotates into the pads and you have them

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.359 
rotates into the pads and you have them
applied<00:01:23.369> that<00:01:23.909> warped<00:01:24.450> or<00:01:24.600> fat<00:01:25.380> spot<00:01:25.740> will

applied that warped or fat spot will

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.550 
applied that warped or fat spot will

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
cause a hydraulic pressure surge it will

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.039 
cause a hydraulic pressure surge it will
force<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.950> pads<00:01:29.159> apart<00:01:29.579> cause<00:01:30.299> that<00:01:30.540> surge<00:01:30.810> to

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
force the pads apart cause that surge to

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.899 
force the pads apart cause that surge to
go<00:01:31.170> backwards<00:01:31.680> through<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:31.950> system<00:01:32.460> through

cause the whole vehicle to shake and
shudder<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:44.009> you'll<00:01:44.460> definitely<00:01:45.030> feel<00:01:45.210> it<00:01:45.390> up

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
shudder and you'll definitely feel it up

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.539
