00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.570
 you and I have a lot of exercises for 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:21.310
 collapse at the factory I want to tell you 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.929
 specifically he himself triangles us 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.710
 there is only property for which there is no 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:28.810
 worked and when we practice with us 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:32.460
 the free zone will improve and become 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.460
 more fit will look young 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.350
 1 dash of them going to do first, we 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.960
 We will work with you with the top 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:48.890
 circular something to that with the upper lip and 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.720
 zones from the lip to the nostrils let's zone 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.780
 also there are various defects for example 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.700
 vertical wrinkles are also heated 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.410
 many people especially women with 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.540
 age can be longitudinal 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.550
 wrinkles act under your nose so that 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.309
 we did not do it ourselves 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:07.040
 which I call a rabbit on such 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.810
 because we will try singer 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.119
 movement that make the rabbit remember 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.490
 when well as he pushes 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.740
 upper lip with spout 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.720
 shrinking try substitute too 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.180
 for this, we first forefingers 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.590
 fingers fix the entire zone of the nasolabial 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.850
 areas and so long fixed and 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.080
 now we will try not to move 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.540
 just not lip 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.149
 there is an important point in google not 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:36.080
 pull in and we just strain it 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:39.100
 and relax try pinned down and how 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.100
 the role of wine and 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.910
 a very important point here is such a need 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.740
 observe in the first lower corner and us 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:53.650
 you need to try completely on the corners 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:59.500
 lips i.e. moving only the upper lip 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:02:02.320
 you don't even feel when we and 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.510
 ran out you immediately appear on 10 com by 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.220
 distinguished and expected day it is very 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.259
 nice bar tones top bugun 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.810
 will improve and shape if someone does not 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.970
 like and also dilute you here 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.680
 accessory 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.930
 we will have the next exercise for 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.000
 paired muscles that we have raised 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.400
 they have the upper lip is here 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.800
 here under the upper lip rise right 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.640
 eyes that is closest to the nose we are with 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:30.459
 it still does not work these muscles are also very 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:34.000
 important for the nasolabial triangle they 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:36.790
 stuffed it immediately appears twisted 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.130
 the hall is the opposite when the opposite 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.260
 they have too much room spasms him 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.150
 may also appear therefore you must 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.730
 learn and felt good and 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.440
 few to pump to this area of ​​the brain 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.660
 full order as we do first 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.030
 look at the mirror and try to understand 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:55.890
 just the upper lip so for example do 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:58.209
 dogs face board just top corner 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.250
 look where you get here yunus 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.980
 node is a very important point because 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.080
 each person is individually at 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.090
 someone can be a hall above 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.430
 someone below so check where 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.549
 putting you when you identified it 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.769
 put fingers you can or two fingers 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:18.130
 or even four fix it well 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:20.860
 start-up zones begins a pledge found 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.350
 put your fingers and now very much 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.690
 We wish here not to give a fair skin 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.980
 and makes exactly the same movement we 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.080
 raise the upper lip 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.120
 it is not necessary to dance complete fool 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.190
 enough even for half a drop 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:37.380
 raise rendered below and 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.380
 relaxing let's try the place understand 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:47.050
 when will hold and suffer 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:50.140
 At first they will be you very quickly 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:52.750
 get tired about the fact that one is not used to us 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.180
 work it ok you increase 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.010
 the number of executions is not gradually 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.080
 overload courage but very important 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.160
 holds the fingers of people that you do not 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.070
 get feedback 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:06.430
 thus pumping these muscles here 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:08.530
 we will leave the fee area directly and 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.690
 learn to feel these sets in order 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.480
 so that ordinary life you do not do 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.820
 some such grimaces of squeamish and not 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:20.049
 strained here here this here 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:22.900
 place and more saying funny triangles 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.790
 Of course you ca n't miss one 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.850
 There are some muscles in the nose too 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:30.430
 They are of course small and this property 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:35.110
 nasal or to be a porno muscles that 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:38.650
 we are inflated by monsters when we are today with 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.310
 you try the front seam and why 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.370
 it is important 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.990
 scientists have proven their nose and ears 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.419
 increase in a person throughout 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.310
 life happens this because they 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:52.270
 consist us and cartilage tissue 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:53.890
 beautiful fabric is more mobile and she to her 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.340
 harder to resist gravity 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:05:00.419
 so all my life they asked 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:02.070
 we are increasing as the force stretches 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:04.320
 severity whether larger and also 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:06.300
 increase too and so if you 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.850
 look at your people and compare 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.410
 let's say their photos are not now 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.240
 youth you will notice that the form 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.250
 really changed a bit like scrapping 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.139
 would be sailing and getting a little longer 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.840
 so that this was not we will be with you 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:19.550
 train their control pants when 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.840
 she is a little bit 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:24.660
 shake it shrink it will keep 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:27.180
 our nose is always a crust and also will 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.370
 tone up in such places again 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.930
 preventing occurrence behind the labial 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.030
 pledge 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:34.830
 this we instantly sonos inspect and deal for 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:41.820
 cable first do without fingers 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:44.550
 just play and nose down very 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:46.400
 it is important not to strain here if you 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:49.050
 9 cm and the gene did not work right away 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.880
 try to do it with your lip 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:57.990
 but only to not for analyzing the corners 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:06:00.120
 around can be slightly wrap this is the same 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.889
 the skill of running around the nose how to move the ears 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:03.300
 is if first to happen through 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:06.060
 some time you sure it 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.710
 it will turn out when you learned to move 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.990
 monster apart now we are a little 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:12.870
 Sprinkler load of our muscles 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:14.669
 we lift a tip with our finger 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:16.889
 nose just a little so you can not 

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:18.840
 here is skin and now for us too 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:28.439
 don't try to tip the nose 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:30.090
 memory further like this 

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:31.860
 when you do this exercise watch 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:34.379
 to also scare you here from 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:36.749
 bridge of the nose and eyebrows do not risk it 

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:38.789
 very important and so we ourselves know three 

00:06:36.749 --> 00:06:40.110
 exercises that will help us keep 

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:42.360
 our nasolabial triangle 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:44.099
 full order i hope they you all 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.930
 It turned out in the next lesson, I will show 

00:06:44.099 --> 00:06:48.360
 you exercise that will help us 

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:51.210
 get rid of excess body fat in 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:55.759
 neck and chin area i wish you a 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:55.759
