we want to take a bowl and grease the
inside<00:02:49.640> take<00:02:50.030> your<00:02:50.209> dough<00:02:50.440> throw<00:02:51.440> it<00:02:51.560> inside

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
inside take your dough throw it inside

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.340 
inside take your dough throw it inside
and<00:02:52.160> turn<00:02:52.880> it<00:02:53.000> over<00:02:53.120> once<00:02:53.420> then<00:02:54.050> you<00:02:54.140> want<00:02:54.290> to

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
and turn it over once then you want to

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.979 
and turn it over once then you want to
cover<00:02:54.590> it<00:02:54.860> and<00:02:54.980> let<00:02:55.550> it<00:02:55.580> sit<00:02:55.940> for<00:02:55.970> an<00:02:56.239> hour<00:02:56.480> so

cover it and let it sit for an hour so

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.259 
cover it and let it sit for an hour so
that<00:02:57.019> it<00:02:57.260> could<00:02:57.410> double<00:02:57.650> in<00:02:58.040> size<00:02:58.280> it's<00:02:59.030> the

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
that it could double in size it's the

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:01.840 
that it could double in size it's the
yeast<00:02:59.540> that<00:02:59.720> makes<00:03:00.080> it<00:03:00.290> double<00:03:00.980> in<00:03:01.130> size<00:03:01.400> I

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
yeast that makes it double in size I

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.630 
yeast that makes it double in size I
just<00:03:02.540> like<00:03:02.660> doing<00:03:02.900> this<00:03:03.110> double<00:03:03.830> in<00:03:04.010> size

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
just like doing this double in size

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.009 
just like doing this double in size
I<00:03:04.670> will<00:03:05.000> given<00:03:05.510> the<00:03:05.570> fact<00:03:05.750> that<00:03:05.810> we're<00:03:05.989> trying

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
I will given the fact that we're trying

can't you know pay attention to things
yeah<00:03:14.090> where<00:03:14.269> was<00:03:14.329> that<00:03:14.390> once<00:03:15.290> the<00:03:15.440> dough<00:03:15.620> is

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829 
yeah where was that once the dough is

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:19.030 
yeah where was that once the dough is
risen<00:03:16.670> and<00:03:17.150> doubled<00:03:17.750> in<00:03:17.870> size<00:03:17.900> you<00:03:18.590> want<00:03:18.890> to

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
risen and doubled in size you want to

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.039 
risen and doubled in size you want to
punch<00:03:19.549> it<00:03:19.640> down<00:03:19.790> and<00:03:20.000> take<00:03:20.510> it<00:03:20.570> out<00:03:20.870> of<00:03:20.959> the

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
punch it down and take it out of the

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:24.340
