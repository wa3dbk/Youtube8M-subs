00:00:19.371 --> 00:00:21.871
Humans are not the natural food source for pythons.

00:00:22.907 --> 00:00:29.107
They will not attack humans, unless they are cornered. And if 
 they’re cornered, they can be vicious and can strike out.

00:00:55.263 --> 00:00:57.263
Pythons in captivity will associate people with food.

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:02.479
People are the ones who feed them and usually its 
 people who have a defrosted rat or rabbit...

00:01:05.295 --> 00:01:08.495
and dangle it and the python reaches out and 
 grabs it with the blink of an eye.

00:01:10.008 --> 00:01:16.908
They are extremely quick and if they were to miss the 
 rabbit and hit the person, it could be devastating.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.940
Nobody really measured the speed of a python, except 
 to tell you, when it’s on a strike...

00:02:00.212 --> 00:02:03.210
...you can’t move out of its way fast enough.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.280
Left alone, pythons will be alright. If you see a 
 python in the wild, turn around and walk away.
