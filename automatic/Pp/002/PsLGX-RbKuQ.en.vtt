on this axis right here and by use of
centripetal<00:00:31.019> force<00:00:31.439> spins<00:00:32.189> this<00:00:32.340> bowl<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:32.910> as

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
centripetal force spins this bowl and as

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.290 
centripetal force spins this bowl and as
oil<00:00:33.540> comes<00:00:34.260> from<00:00:34.380> this<00:00:34.680> nozzle<00:00:35.000> into<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.120> bowl

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
oil comes from this nozzle into the bowl

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.069 
oil comes from this nozzle into the bowl
it'll<00:00:37.170> drop<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.739> bottom<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.370> then<00:00:39.239> stick

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
it'll drop to the bottom and then stick

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.959 
it'll drop to the bottom and then stick
to<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.320> wall<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.770> this<00:00:40.950> is<00:00:41.129> mainly<00:00:41.309> used<00:00:41.760> to

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
to the wall and this is mainly used to

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.840 
to the wall and this is mainly used to
separate<00:00:42.329> out<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.719> water<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.610> any<00:00:44.610> food

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
separate out the water and any food

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.369 
separate out the water and any food
particles<00:00:45.420> or<00:00:45.570> other<00:00:45.719> particles<00:00:46.110> that<00:00:46.170> might

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
particles or other particles that might

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.529 
particles or other particles that might
be<00:00:46.530> in<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.860> oil<00:00:47.039> so<00:00:47.340> that<00:00:47.520> only<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.329> clean<00:00:48.510> oil

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
be in the oil so that only the clean oil

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.470 
be in the oil so that only the clean oil
comes<00:00:48.840> out<00:00:48.989> as<00:00:49.170> you<00:00:49.320> know<00:00:49.469> oil<00:00:50.300> doesn't<00:00:51.300> weigh

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
comes out as you know oil doesn't weigh

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.000 
comes out as you know oil doesn't weigh
as<00:00:51.600> much<00:00:51.660> as<00:00:51.780> water<00:00:52.079> so<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.500> water<00:00:52.710> will<00:00:52.860> be

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
as much as water so the water will be

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.860 
as much as water so the water will be
heavier<00:00:53.460> thus<00:00:53.940> it'll<00:00:54.210> stick<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.539> back<00:00:54.750> of

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
heavier thus it'll stick to the back of

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.630 
heavier thus it'll stick to the back of
the<00:00:54.930> wall<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.350> only<00:00:55.680> clean<00:00:55.949> oil<00:00:55.980> once<00:00:56.489> this

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
the wall and only clean oil once this

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.000 
the wall and only clean oil once this
whole<00:00:56.910> bowls<00:00:57.270> filled<00:00:57.750> up<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.649> its<00:00:58.770> brim

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
whole bowls filled up to its brim

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.069 
whole bowls filled up to its brim
there's<00:00:59.250> about<00:00:59.399> an<00:00:59.579> inch<00:00:59.760> chef's<00:00:59.969> space<00:01:00.270> once

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
there's about an inch chef's space once

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.200 
there's about an inch chef's space once
it's<00:01:01.260> filled<00:01:01.469> up<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.649> here<00:01:01.829> with<00:01:02.070> volume<00:01:02.550> then

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
it's filled up to here with volume then

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.090 
it's filled up to here with volume then
just<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.690> clean<00:01:03.960> oil<00:01:03.989> will<00:01:04.409> pour<00:01:04.680> out<00:01:04.710> over

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
just the clean oil will pour out over

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.399 
just the clean oil will pour out over
the<00:01:05.220> edge<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:06.240> clean<00:01:06.479> oil<00:01:06.510> pulls<00:01:06.960> out<00:01:07.110> over

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
the edge the clean oil pulls out over

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.160 
the edge the clean oil pulls out over
the<00:01:07.500> edge<00:01:07.740> then<00:01:08.490> can<00:01:08.729> go<00:01:08.880> there's<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.600> hole<00:01:09.960> down

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
the edge then can go there's a hole down

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.310 
the edge then can go there's a hole down
here<00:01:10.229> drain<00:01:10.770> hole<00:01:11.420> that<00:01:12.420> then<00:01:12.630> will<00:01:13.020> come<00:01:13.200> from

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
here drain hole that then will come from

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.300 
here drain hole that then will come from
this<00:01:13.530> line<00:01:13.799> so<00:01:14.760> I'm<00:01:15.060> going<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.270> show<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:16.310> how

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
this line so I'm going to show you how

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.340 
this line so I'm going to show you how
this<00:01:17.430> works<00:01:17.750> there's<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.810> little<00:01:18.990> bit<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.200> oil

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
this works there's a little bit of oil

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.399 
this works there's a little bit of oil
in<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.590> bowl<00:01:19.740> now<00:01:20.060> you<00:01:21.060> can<00:01:21.180> see<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.509> if<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:22.380> just

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
in the bowl now you can see it if I just

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.080 
in the bowl now you can see it if I just
spin<00:01:22.799> this<00:01:22.920> with<00:01:23.130> just<00:01:23.340> my<00:01:23.490> hand<00:01:23.759> you'll<00:01:23.939> see

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
spin this with just my hand you'll see

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.090 
spin this with just my hand you'll see
the<00:01:24.210> oil<00:01:24.240> go<00:01:24.869> up<00:01:25.080> against<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.439> wall<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:25.920> start

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
the oil go up against the wall and start

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.280 
the oil go up against the wall and start
sticking<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.700> sidewall<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:28.049> so<00:01:28.170> that's

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
sticking to the sidewall and so that's

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.810 
sticking to the sidewall and so that's
it<00:01:28.439> what<00:01:28.590> happens<00:01:28.890> kind<00:01:29.130> of<00:01:29.250> like<00:01:29.369> that<00:01:29.579> ride

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
it what happens kind of like that ride

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.100 
it what happens kind of like that ride
used<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.119> ride<00:01:30.240> at<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.360> carnival<00:01:30.420> where<00:01:31.020> you

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
used to ride at the carnival where you

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.539 
used to ride at the carnival where you
stick<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.650> wall<00:01:31.770> it's<00:01:31.950> spin<00:01:32.159> so<00:01:32.310> fast

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
stick to the wall it's spin so fast

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.940 
stick to the wall it's spin so fast
you'd<00:01:32.759> stick<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.299> wall<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:34.710> floor

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
you'd stick to the wall and the floor

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.499 
you'd stick to the wall and the floor
could<00:01:35.159> drop<00:01:35.310> out<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.939> it<00:01:36.240> wouldn't<00:01:36.360> matter

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
could drop out and it wouldn't matter

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.690 
could drop out and it wouldn't matter
due<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.350> centripetal<00:01:37.619> force<00:01:38.009> you<00:01:38.369> would<00:01:38.490> stay

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
due to centripetal force you would stay

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.880 
due to centripetal force you would stay
out<00:01:38.729> against<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.299> wall<00:01:39.420> so<00:01:40.229> I'm<00:01:40.590> going<00:01:40.829> to

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
out against the wall so I'm going to

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.460 
out against the wall so I'm going to
open<00:01:41.009> up<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:42.000> valve<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.659> allow<00:01:42.899> some<00:01:43.110> oil<00:01:43.320> to

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
open up the valve and allow some oil to

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:55.980 
open up the valve and allow some oil to

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
so here you see some particles that are

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:03.190 
so here you see some particles that are
in<00:01:58.460> there<00:01:59.890> it's<00:02:00.890> coming<00:02:01.189> in<00:02:01.280> right<00:02:01.429> now<00:02:02.200> it's

just a quick second turn it on all the
water<00:02:22.940> goes<00:02:23.150> up<00:02:23.180> against<00:02:23.480> the<00:02:23.569> wall<00:02:24.250> I'm<00:02:25.250> gonna

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
water goes up against the wall I'm gonna

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:32.110 
water goes up against the wall I'm gonna
turn<00:02:25.489> on

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.449 

a<00:02:32.150> little<00:02:33.080> more<00:02:33.200> watt<00:02:33.470> oil<00:02:33.800> in<00:02:34.010> there<00:02:34.190> just<00:02:34.220> to

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
a little more watt oil in there just to

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:56.330 
a little more watt oil in there just to
fill<00:02:34.670> it<00:02:34.819> out

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.170 

pulls<00:02:57.209> it<00:02:57.390> about<00:02:57.600> half-full

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.059 

we<00:03:00.299> need<00:03:00.659> to<00:03:00.840> see<00:03:01.049> whatever<00:03:01.230> I<00:03:01.379> turn<00:03:01.620> it<00:03:01.739> off

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
we need to see whatever I turn it off

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.640 
we need to see whatever I turn it off
we'll<00:03:03.340> see<00:03:03.659> what<00:03:04.659> happens<00:03:05.079> there

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
we'll see what happens there

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.050 
we'll see what happens there
the<00:03:06.920> oil<00:03:07.130> sticking<00:03:07.520> up<00:03:07.610> against<00:03:07.819> the<00:03:07.880> wall

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
the oil sticking up against the wall

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.490 
the oil sticking up against the wall
right<00:03:08.090> now<00:03:08.270> just<00:03:08.510> looks<00:03:08.660> like<00:03:08.750> a<00:03:08.870> solid<00:03:09.290> wall

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
right now just looks like a solid wall

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:17.180 
right now just looks like a solid wall
in<00:03:09.650> their<00:03:09.830> oil

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.550 

turn<00:03:17.790> it<00:03:17.880> off<00:03:18.060> about<00:03:18.810> that<00:03:19.260> off<00:03:19.410> my

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
turn it off about that off my

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.000 
turn it off about that off my
lights<00:03:20.480> use<00:03:21.480> a<00:03:21.510> rag<00:03:21.840> here<00:03:22.140> to<00:03:22.230> stop<00:03:22.500> it's<00:03:22.770> going

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
lights use a rag here to stop it's going

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.450 
lights use a rag here to stop it's going
really<00:03:23.220> fast<00:03:23.460> full<00:03:23.910> energies<00:03:24.360> several<00:03:24.900> rpms

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:25.460 
really fast full energies several rpms

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.920 
really fast full energies several rpms
as<00:03:26.460> I<00:03:26.730> slow<00:03:26.970> down<00:03:27.240> you'll<00:03:27.450> start<00:03:27.660> seeing<00:03:27.840> that

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
as I slow down you'll start seeing that

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:38.290 
as I slow down you'll start seeing that
oil<00:03:28.140> take<00:03:28.470> back<00:03:28.710> shape<00:03:29.450> and<00:03:30.450> get<00:03:30.570> off<00:03:30.720> the<00:03:30.870> wall

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.400 

you<00:03:39.300> see<00:03:39.480> it<00:03:39.570> coming<00:03:39.840> back<00:03:39.960> to<00:03:40.170> its<00:03:40.320> original

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
you see it coming back to its original

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:41.690 
you see it coming back to its original
shape<00:03:40.680> or<00:03:41.040> it's<00:03:41.130> all<00:03:41.220> going<00:03:41.370> to<00:03:41.430> lay<00:03:41.490> on<00:03:41.610> the

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
shape or it's all going to lay on the

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:47.570 
shape or it's all going to lay on the
bottom<00:03:42.710> the<00:03:43.710> bowl<00:03:46.010> so<00:03:47.010> again<00:03:47.340> I'm<00:03:47.430> going<00:03:47.520> to

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
bottom the bowl so again I'm going to

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.400 
bottom the bowl so again I'm going to
plug<00:03:47.850> it<00:03:48.000> in<00:03:48.180> and<00:03:48.570> you'll<00:03:48.690> be<00:03:48.810> able<00:03:48.900> to<00:03:49.050> see<00:03:49.260> it

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
plug it in and you'll be able to see it

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:50.990 
plug it in and you'll be able to see it
go<00:03:49.590> straight<00:03:49.920> back<00:03:50.160> to<00:03:50.340> the<00:03:50.430> wall<00:03:50.610> and<00:03:50.850> then

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
go straight back to the wall and then

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.310 
go straight back to the wall and then
this<00:03:51.150> time<00:03:51.360> I'll<00:03:51.510> let<00:03:51.540> it<00:03:51.750> fill<00:03:51.960> all<00:03:52.110> the<00:03:52.230> way

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
this time I'll let it fill all the way

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.810 
this time I'll let it fill all the way
up<00:03:52.440> so<00:03:52.650> the<00:03:52.800> clean<00:03:53.040> oil<00:03:53.070> starts<00:03:53.460> pouring<00:03:53.700> out

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
up so the clean oil starts pouring out

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:54.530 
up so the clean oil starts pouring out
over<00:03:54.030> the<00:03:54.120> edge

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
over the edge

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.240 
over the edge
you<00:03:54.930> can<00:03:55.020> see<00:03:55.140> these<00:03:55.230> chunks<00:03:55.590> of<00:03:55.710> particles<00:03:56.130> in

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
you can see these chunks of particles in

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.500 
you can see these chunks of particles in
there<00:03:56.370> those<00:03:56.580> are<00:03:56.730> sticking<00:03:57.030> against<00:03:57.240> a<00:03:57.330> wall

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
there those are sticking against a wall

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.320 
there those are sticking against a wall
so<00:03:57.750> whenever<00:03:58.710> it<00:03:58.860> starts<00:03:59.130> filling<00:04:00.000> all<00:04:00.210> the

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
so whenever it starts filling all the

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:01.970 
so whenever it starts filling all the
way<00:04:00.420> up<00:04:00.540> those<00:04:01.140> particles<00:04:01.590> will<00:04:01.680> still<00:04:01.890> be

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
way up those particles will still be

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.320 
way up those particles will still be
back<00:04:02.130> here<00:04:02.340> against<00:04:02.490> this<00:04:02.580> back<00:04:02.790> wall<00:04:03.000> but<00:04:03.270> the

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
back here against this back wall but the

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:51.029 
back here against this back wall but the
clean<00:04:03.570> oil<00:04:03.600> come<00:04:03.990> over<00:04:04.170> the<00:04:04.260> top

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:51.039 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:53.760 

alright<00:04:51.759> see<00:04:52.330> it<00:04:52.449> now<00:04:52.629> forgets<00:04:53.139> this<00:04:53.289> outside

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
alright see it now forgets this outside

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.890 
alright see it now forgets this outside
wall<00:04:54.039> is<00:04:54.699> actually<00:04:54.909> oil<00:04:55.300> it's<00:04:55.509> hitting<00:04:55.689> it

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
wall is actually oil it's hitting it

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.809 
wall is actually oil it's hitting it
can't<00:04:56.619> really<00:04:56.770> see<00:04:56.919> the<00:04:57.039> oil<00:04:57.069> coming<00:04:57.610> over

00:04:57.809 --> 00:04:57.819 
can't really see the oil coming over

00:04:57.819 --> 00:04:59.969 
can't really see the oil coming over
this<00:04:57.909> edge<00:04:58.150> does<00:04:58.960> the<00:04:59.110> oil<00:04:59.349> hits<00:04:59.559> the<00:04:59.710> bottom

00:04:59.969 --> 00:04:59.979 
this edge does the oil hits the bottom
