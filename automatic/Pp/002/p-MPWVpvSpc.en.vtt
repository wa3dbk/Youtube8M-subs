carbon and in the kinetic series which

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.790 
carbon and in the kinetic series which
is<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.710> little<00:00:37.890> bit<00:00:37.980> less<00:00:38.129> money<00:00:39.230> this<00:00:40.230> here<00:00:40.649> is

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
is a little bit less money this here is

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.470 
is a little bit less money this here is
made<00:00:41.309> out<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.520> neoprene<00:00:41.910> so<00:00:42.149> it's<00:00:42.270> wind

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
made out of a neoprene so it's wind

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.000 
made out of a neoprene so it's wind
proof<00:00:42.690> it's<00:00:42.930> got<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.050> little<00:00:43.290> metal<00:00:43.440> tab<00:00:43.590> init

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
proof it's got a little metal tab init

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.410 
proof it's got a little metal tab init
so<00:00:44.070> you<00:00:44.129> can<00:00:44.219> kind<00:00:44.370> of<00:00:44.399> fold<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:44.940> former<00:00:45.300> to

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
so you can kind of fold it and former to

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.000 
so you can kind of fold it and former to
your<00:00:45.539> nose<00:00:45.660> so<00:00:46.260> that<00:00:46.350> you<00:00:46.410> get<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.559> good<00:00:46.710> seal

nice headstock comes in and the breath
box<00:00:53.910> helps<00:00:54.270> take<00:00:54.570> up<00:00:54.690> any<00:00:54.840> extra<00:00:54.899> area<00:00:55.789> the

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
box helps take up any extra area the

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.590 
box helps take up any extra area the
goggles<00:00:57.210> that<00:00:57.239> we<00:00:57.510> like<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.840> use<00:00:58.020> are<00:00:58.760> 509<00:00:59.760> this

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
goggles that we like to use are 509 this

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.720 
goggles that we like to use are 509 this
here's<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.989> aviator<00:01:01.440> goggle<00:01:01.859> this<00:01:02.550> one

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
here's the aviator goggle this one

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.100 
here's the aviator goggle this one
doesn't<00:01:03.000> have<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.149> extra<00:01:03.629> foam<00:01:03.840> around<00:01:03.989> the

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
doesn't have the extra foam around the

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.750 
doesn't have the extra foam around the
outside<00:01:04.500> of<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.650> frame<00:01:04.890> because<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.460> frames

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
outside of the frame because the frames

so<00:01:05.970> large<00:01:06.210> itself<00:01:06.600> so<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:06.810> gives<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.049> really

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
so large itself so it gives you a really

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.500 
so large itself so it gives you a really
good<00:01:07.530> field<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.920> view<00:01:08.130> you<00:01:08.310> don't<00:01:09.150> see<00:01:09.390> the

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
good field of view you don't see the

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.359 
good field of view you don't see the
goggle<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:09.960> it's<00:01:10.110> on<00:01:10.290> really<00:01:10.619> there's<00:01:11.130> hardly

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
goggle and it's on really there's hardly

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.609 
goggle and it's on really there's hardly
any<00:01:11.640> any<00:01:12.330> obstruction<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.200> your<00:01:13.320> vision<00:01:13.560> on

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
nose piece in like that then you're

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.719 
nose piece in like that then you're
gonna<00:01:26.850> pull<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.150> strap<00:01:27.390> down<00:01:27.689> over<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.020> back

this helmet then the aviator that's why
the<00:02:34.190> balaclava<00:02:34.850> comes<00:02:35.239> in<00:02:35.390> handy<00:02:35.569> the<00:02:35.810> ignitor

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
the balaclava comes in handy the ignitor

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.470 
the balaclava comes in handy the ignitor
balaclava<00:02:36.800> actually<00:02:37.130> has<00:02:37.280> a<00:02:37.519> wind<00:02:38.120> stopper

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
balaclava actually has a wind stopper

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.479 
balaclava actually has a wind stopper
material<00:02:38.870> all<00:02:39.019> around<00:02:39.260> the<00:02:39.530> entire<00:02:39.920> edge<00:02:40.130> so

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
material all around the entire edge so

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.210 
material all around the entire edge so
helps<00:02:41.480> with<00:02:41.959> that<00:02:42.110> as<00:02:42.260> well<00:02:42.470> so<00:02:42.890> we'll<00:02:43.040> throw

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
helps with that as well so we'll throw
