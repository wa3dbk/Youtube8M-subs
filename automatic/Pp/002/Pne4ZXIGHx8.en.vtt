to<00:01:03.750> achieve<00:01:03.899> in<00:01:04.290> all<00:01:04.409> of<00:01:04.530> this<00:01:04.680> is<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.640> give<00:01:05.820> the

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
to achieve in all of this is to give the

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.300 
to achieve in all of this is to give the
AMD<00:01:06.479> guys<00:01:06.689> a<00:01:07.020> good<00:01:07.290> idea<00:01:07.650> of<00:01:07.860> how<00:01:08.070> these<00:01:08.250> two

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
cards will perform now I am see I don't

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.609

know<00:01:12.479> what<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.689> tell<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:12.900> guys<00:01:13.049> about<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.380> CPU

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
know what to tell you guys about the CPU

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.570 
know what to tell you guys about the CPU
this<00:01:14.070> is<00:01:14.250> an<00:01:14.369> FX<00:01:14.880> 80<00:01:15.350> 140<00:01:16.350> which<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.100> some<00:01:17.340> like

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
this is an FX 80 140 which is some like

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.300 
this is an FX 80 140 which is some like
weird<00:01:17.909> CPU<00:01:18.509> that<00:01:18.770> doesn't<00:01:19.770> seem<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.159> be

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
weird CPU that doesn't seem to be

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.240 
weird CPU that doesn't seem to be
existing<00:01:21.150> anywhere<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.140> I<00:01:22.860> don't<00:01:22.920> know<00:01:23.100> if

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
existing anywhere and I don't know if

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.499 
existing anywhere and I don't know if
it's<00:01:23.369> ever<00:01:23.490> even<00:01:23.700> gonna<00:01:23.850> be<00:01:24.000> released<00:01:24.299> but

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
it's ever even gonna be released but

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:25.969 
it's ever even gonna be released but
what<00:01:24.659> I've<00:01:24.780> done<00:01:24.930> is<00:01:25.110> I've<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:25.650> at<00:01:25.770> 4

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
what I've done is I've it at 4

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.100 
what I've done is I've it at 4
gigahertz<00:01:26.280> so<00:01:26.729> that<00:01:26.880> should<00:01:27.119> be<00:01:27.299> fairly

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
gigahertz so that should be fairly

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.649 
gigahertz so that should be fairly
equivalent<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.130> something<00:01:29.549> like<00:01:29.700> an<00:01:29.850> 80<00:01:30.000> 150

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
equivalent to something like an 80 150

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.170 
equivalent to something like an 80 150
in<00:01:30.750> terms<00:01:30.960> of<00:01:31.110> performance<00:01:31.259> in<00:01:31.890> most<00:01:32.490> games<00:01:32.759> 4

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
in terms of performance in most games 4

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.090 
in terms of performance in most games 4
gigahertz<00:01:33.450> is<00:01:33.750> an<00:01:33.869> easy<00:01:34.020> overclock<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:34.829> just

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
gigahertz is an easy overclock so just

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.010 
gigahertz is an easy overclock so just
bear<00:01:35.729> that<00:01:35.759> in<00:01:36.119> mind<00:01:36.150> we're<00:01:36.750> gonna<00:01:36.840> be

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
bear that in mind we're gonna be

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.460 
bear that in mind we're gonna be
comparing<00:01:37.409> this<00:01:37.619> AMD<00:01:38.220> 8<00:01:38.700> core<00:01:39.150> at<00:01:39.450> 4<00:01:40.170> gigahertz

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
comparing this AMD 8 core at 4 gigahertz

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.620

then<00:01:45.780> we're<00:01:45.899> also<00:01:46.020> gonna<00:01:46.170> be<00:01:46.380> comparing<00:01:46.950> this

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
then we're also gonna be comparing this

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.880 
then we're also gonna be comparing this

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
regular performance review with my 3930k

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.459 
regular performance review with my 3930k
platform<00:02:04.079> on<00:02:04.259> LGA<00:02:04.710> 2011<00:02:04.829> I<00:02:05.610> am<00:02:05.729> using<00:02:06.000> all

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:06.469 
platform on LGA 2011 I am using all

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:09.010 
platform on LGA 2011 I am using all
ultra<00:02:07.469> maximum<00:02:08.099> settings<00:02:08.489> other

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
ultra maximum settings other

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.990 
ultra maximum settings other
maxing<00:02:09.620> out<00:02:09.710> the<00:02:09.920> anti-aliasing<00:02:10.520> which<00:02:10.820> I've

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
maxing out the anti-aliasing which I've

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.450 
maxing out the anti-aliasing which I've
got<00:02:11.210> pegged<00:02:11.480> f4x<00:02:12.020> which<00:02:12.710> for<00:02:12.890> me<00:02:13.010> is<00:02:13.040> a<00:02:13.160> pretty

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
got pegged f4x which for me is a pretty

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.670 
got pegged f4x which for me is a pretty
comfortable<00:02:14.000> setting<00:02:14.240> at<00:02:14.480> 1080p<00:02:15.050> I<00:02:15.080> find<00:02:15.470> that

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
comfortable setting at 1080p I find that

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.830 
comfortable setting at 1080p I find that
reduces<00:02:16.580> most<00:02:16.820> of<00:02:17.000> the<00:02:17.090> jakey's<00:02:17.480> for<00:02:17.720> me

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
reduces most of the jakey's for me

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.320 
reduces most of the jakey's for me
personally<00:02:18.050> so<00:02:18.650> since<00:02:19.550> I'm<00:02:19.850> the<00:02:20.060> one<00:02:20.180> doing

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
personally so since I'm the one doing

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:21.790 
personally so since I'm the one doing
the<00:02:20.540> video<00:02:20.750> I<00:02:20.810> guess<00:02:21.080> I<00:02:21.200> get<00:02:21.350> to<00:02:21.440> pick<00:02:21.560> things

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
the video I guess I get to pick things

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.370 
the video I guess I get to pick things
like<00:02:21.980> that<00:02:22.190> so<00:02:23.000> yeah<00:02:23.180> we're<00:02:23.450> at<00:02:23.540> 1080p<00:02:23.930> we're

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
like that so yeah we're at 1080p we're

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.950 
like that so yeah we're at 1080p we're
at<00:02:24.530> Ultra<00:02:25.100> or<00:02:25.460> high<00:02:25.970> or<00:02:26.270> whatever<00:02:26.570> they<00:02:26.750> want

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
at Ultra or high or whatever they want

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.570 
at Ultra or high or whatever they want
to<00:02:27.050> call<00:02:27.200> it<00:02:27.350> settings<00:02:27.680> across<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:28.130> board<00:02:28.370> on

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
to call it settings across the board on

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.050 
to call it settings across the board on
all<00:02:29.180> of<00:02:29.330> these<00:02:29.450> games<00:02:29.750> and<00:02:30.400> here<00:02:31.400> I<00:02:31.430> go<00:02:31.670> so<00:02:31.940> now

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
all of these games and here I go so now

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.080 
all of these games and here I go so now
I'm<00:02:32.270> testing<00:02:32.720> the<00:02:32.810> GTX<00:02:33.290> 680<00:02:33.710> on<00:02:34.070> this<00:02:34.820> same

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
I'm testing the GTX 680 on this same

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:41.830 
I'm testing the GTX 680 on this same
platform<00:02:35.690> and<00:02:39.100> be<00:02:40.100> prepared<00:02:40.510> crazy<00:02:41.510> stuffs

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
platform and be prepared crazy stuffs

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.900 
platform and be prepared crazy stuffs
gonna<00:02:41.990> happen<00:02:42.320> all<00:02:42.830> right<00:02:42.980> guys<00:02:43.190> well<00:02:43.460> results

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
gonna happen all right guys well results

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.270 
gonna happen all right guys well results
are<00:02:44.000> done<00:02:44.210> so<00:02:44.480> I<00:02:44.510> guess<00:02:44.780> you<00:02:44.930> can<00:02:45.080> kind<00:02:45.410> of<00:02:45.530> hang

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
are done so I guess you can kind of hang

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.790 
are done so I guess you can kind of hang
with<00:02:46.520> me<00:02:46.730> while<00:02:46.940> I<00:02:47.050> while<00:02:48.050> I<00:02:48.080> rearrange<00:02:48.560> the

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
with me while I while I rearrange the

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.560 
with me while I while I rearrange the
spreadsheet<00:02:49.250> a<00:02:49.280> little<00:02:49.580> bit<00:02:49.730> so<00:02:50.330> I'm<00:02:50.420> just

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
spreadsheet a little bit so I'm just

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.660 
spreadsheet a little bit so I'm just
gonna<00:02:50.780> hide<00:02:51.110> some<00:02:51.500> of<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:51.740> less<00:02:51.920> relevant

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
gonna hide some of the less relevant

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.170 
gonna hide some of the less relevant
rows<00:02:53.030> and<00:02:53.860> we're<00:02:54.860> just<00:02:54.980> gonna<00:02:55.160> stay<00:02:55.520> focused

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
rows and we're just gonna stay focused

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:02.170 
rows and we're just gonna stay focused
on<00:02:57.700> bulldozer<00:02:58.700> 680<00:02:59.510> versus<00:03:00.310> 7970<00:03:01.340> and<00:03:01.520> then

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
on bulldozer 680 versus 7970 and then

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
on bulldozer 680 versus 7970 and then
we're<00:03:02.450> also<00:03:02.660> going<00:03:03.260> to<00:03:04.570> pair<00:03:05.570> all<00:03:05.840> of<00:03:05.990> these

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
we're also going to pair all of these

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.910 
we're also going to pair all of these
down<00:03:06.880> to<00:03:07.880> just<00:03:08.330> the<00:03:08.690> 680<00:03:09.320> and<00:03:10.000> the<00:03:11.050> 7970<00:03:12.050> on<00:03:12.230> the

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
down to just the 680 and the 7970 on the

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.520 
down to just the 680 and the 7970 on the
3930k<00:03:13.820> platform<00:03:14.630> so<00:03:14.810> these<00:03:14.900> are<00:03:15.080> using<00:03:15.230> all<00:03:15.500> of

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
3930k platform so these are using all of

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.340 
3930k platform so these are using all of
the<00:03:15.740> same<00:03:16.209> testing<00:03:17.209> methodologies<00:03:17.959> other

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
the same testing methodologies other

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.830 
the same testing methodologies other
than<00:03:18.890> changing<00:03:19.400> the<00:03:19.640> CPU<00:03:20.209> and<00:03:20.360> changing<00:03:20.720> the

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
than changing the CPU and changing the

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.190 
than changing the CPU and changing the
RAM<00:03:21.020> so<00:03:21.680> the<00:03:21.950> 3930k<00:03:22.700> has<00:03:23.000> 16<00:03:23.390> gigs<00:03:23.660> around<00:03:23.810> and

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
RAM so the 3930k has 16 gigs around and

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.720 
RAM so the 3930k has 16 gigs around and
this<00:03:24.260> one<00:03:24.440> has<00:03:24.560> only<00:03:24.680> 8<00:03:24.890> gigs<00:03:25.130> of<00:03:25.250> ram<00:03:25.400> although

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
this one has only 8 gigs of ram although

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.910 
this one has only 8 gigs of ram although
I<00:03:26.030> really<00:03:26.870> can't<00:03:27.200> imagine<00:03:27.260> that'll<00:03:27.770> make<00:03:27.890> a

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
I really can't imagine that'll make a

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.320 
I really can't imagine that'll make a
difference<00:03:28.040> in<00:03:28.459> anything<00:03:28.640> other<00:03:28.880> than<00:03:29.000> power

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
difference in anything other than power

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.260 
difference in anything other than power
consumption<00:03:29.990> so<00:03:30.020> the<00:03:30.800> 3930k<00:03:31.640> should<00:03:32.000> be<00:03:32.120> at

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:32.270 
consumption so the 3930k should be at

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:33.940 
consumption so the 3930k should be at
somewhat<00:03:32.570> of<00:03:32.600> a<00:03:32.750> disadvantage<00:03:32.780> because<00:03:33.680> it

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
somewhat of a disadvantage because it

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:39.010 
somewhat of a disadvantage because it
does<00:03:34.130> have<00:03:34.340> more<00:03:34.610> RAM<00:03:34.940> on<00:03:35.720> board<00:03:36.200> it<00:03:38.020> other

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:39.020 
does have more RAM on board it other

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.290 
does have more RAM on board it other
than<00:03:39.230> that<00:03:39.290> I<00:03:39.500> think<00:03:39.830> we're<00:03:40.010> pretty<00:03:40.610> darn<00:03:40.910> near

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 
than that I think we're pretty darn near

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.150 
than that I think we're pretty darn near
identical<00:03:41.480> here<00:03:42.170> this<00:03:42.350> is<00:03:42.500> across<00:03:42.740> there<00:03:42.950> 5

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
identical here this is across there 5

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.070 
identical here this is across there 5
formula<00:03:43.790> and<00:03:43.970> never<00:03:44.270> mentioned<00:03:44.630> that<00:03:44.690> before

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
formula and never mentioned that before

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.770 
formula and never mentioned that before
from<00:03:45.200> Asus<00:03:45.620> and<00:03:45.890> I<00:03:46.760> think<00:03:47.000> that's<00:03:47.209> that's

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
from Asus and I think that's that's

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.900 
from Asus and I think that's that's
that's<00:03:48.050> pretty<00:03:48.320> much<00:03:48.500> it<00:03:48.709> so<00:03:48.890> here<00:03:49.459> we<00:03:49.580> go<00:03:49.700> so

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
that's pretty much it so here we go so

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.030 
that's pretty much it so here we go so
idle<00:03:50.240> power<00:03:50.450> is<00:03:50.720> pretty<00:03:51.170> darn<00:03:51.470> close<00:03:51.770> I<00:03:51.980> would

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
idle power is pretty darn close I would

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.190 
idle power is pretty darn close I would
say<00:03:52.280> this<00:03:52.430> is<00:03:52.610> within<00:03:52.880> margin<00:03:53.330> of<00:03:53.450> error<00:03:53.630> for

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
say this is within margin of error for

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.020 
say this is within margin of error for
both<00:03:54.380> of<00:03:54.590> these<00:03:54.680> systems<00:03:54.950> so<00:03:55.400> they're<00:03:55.670> yeah

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
both of these systems so they're yeah

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.220 
both of these systems so they're yeah
they're<00:03:56.060> very<00:03:56.240> close<00:03:56.630> that<00:03:56.810> way<00:03:56.959> and<00:03:57.080> once

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
they're very close that way and once

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.650 
they're very close that way and once
again<00:03:57.350> I<00:03:57.500> can't<00:03:57.800> say<00:03:58.070> necessarily<00:03:58.730> that<00:03:59.480> my

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
again I can't say necessarily that my

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.540 
again I can't say necessarily that my
results<00:04:00.140> are<00:04:00.350> you<00:04:00.920> know<00:04:01.040> I<00:04:01.070> should<00:04:01.370> put<00:04:01.520> like

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:01.550 
results are you know I should put like

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:06.580 
results are you know I should put like
quotes<00:04:02.300> here<00:04:02.660> yeah<00:04:03.590> it's<00:04:03.890> an<00:04:04.480> fx-8150<00:04:05.590> because

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
quotes here yeah it's an fx-8150 because

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.180 
quotes here yeah it's an fx-8150 because
this<00:04:06.739> is<00:04:06.860> a<00:04:06.890> 95<00:04:07.489> watt<00:04:07.820> TDP<00:04:08.410> CPU<00:04:09.410> so<00:04:09.739> I<00:04:09.770> don't

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
this is a 95 watt TDP CPU so I don't

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.110 
this is a 95 watt TDP CPU so I don't
know<00:04:10.250> how<00:04:10.340> much<00:04:10.430> of<00:04:10.580> a<00:04:10.670> difference<00:04:10.970> that's

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
know how much of a difference that's

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.430 
know how much of a difference that's
gonna<00:04:11.270> make<00:04:11.480> to<00:04:11.600> things<00:04:11.780> like<00:04:11.870> idle<00:04:12.260> power

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
gonna make to things like idle power

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.070 
gonna make to things like idle power

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.810

much<00:04:17.239> not<00:04:17.510> affected<00:04:17.989> this<00:04:18.140> is<00:04:18.250> yeah<00:04:19.250> very<00:04:19.549> very

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
much not affected this is yeah very very

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.810 
much not affected this is yeah very very
close<00:04:20.380> but<00:04:21.380> we<00:04:21.620> do<00:04:21.770> see<00:04:21.979> a<00:04:22.010> slight<00:04:22.370> perform

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
close but we do see a slight perform

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.390 
close but we do see a slight perform

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
decrease on the AMD platform over here I

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.860 
decrease on the AMD platform over here I
see<00:04:25.790> I<00:04:25.820> didn't<00:04:26.120> take<00:04:26.210> temp<00:04:26.450> readings<00:04:26.750> this

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
see I didn't take temp readings this

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.150 
see I didn't take temp readings this
time<00:04:27.080> around<00:04:27.290> because<00:04:27.500> this<00:04:27.620> is<00:04:27.740> just<00:04:27.890> card

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
time around because this is just card

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.410 
time around because this is just card
temperatures<00:04:28.700> I<00:04:28.850> don't<00:04:29.000> really<00:04:29.210> care<00:04:29.390> about

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420 
temperatures I don't really care about

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:30.850 
temperatures I don't really care about
that<00:04:29.600> the<00:04:29.960> second<00:04:30.260> time<00:04:30.410> around<00:04:30.530> for

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
that the second time around for

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.950 
that the second time around for
Battlefield<00:04:31.640> 3<00:04:31.880> you<00:04:32.000> can<00:04:32.150> see<00:04:32.180> performance<00:04:32.840> is

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
Battlefield 3 you can see performance is

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.160 
Battlefield 3 you can see performance is
pretty<00:04:33.500> near<00:04:34.010> identical<00:04:34.780> across<00:04:35.780> the<00:04:36.050> two

pretty near identical across the two

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:38.380 
pretty near identical across the two

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.390

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.990 
scenarios where just because the CPU
slower<00:04:42.140> doesn't<00:04:43.040> mean<00:04:43.190> that<00:04:43.310> it<00:04:43.490> will<00:04:43.640> perform

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
slower doesn't mean that it will perform

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.300

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:54.940 
you can see this is just a disaster

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:59.950 
you can see this is just a disaster
overall<00:05:55.940> power<00:05:56.360> consumption<00:05:56.960> is<00:05:57.320> fairly<00:05:58.960> you

00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960 
overall power consumption is fairly you

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:00.310 
overall power consumption is fairly you
know

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:00.320 
know

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.220 
know
well<00:06:00.650> higher<00:06:01.220> on<00:06:01.580> the<00:06:01.880> AMD<00:06:02.150> platform<00:06:02.840> pretty

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:03.230 
well higher on the AMD platform pretty

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:05.650 
well higher on the AMD platform pretty
much<00:06:03.380> across<00:06:03.650> the<00:06:03.740> board<00:06:04.090> so<00:06:05.090> you<00:06:05.210> can<00:06:05.480> see

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:05.660 
much across the board so you can see

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.660 
much across the board so you can see
that<00:06:05.870> it<00:06:06.020> must<00:06:06.230> be<00:06:06.410> somewhere<00:06:06.830> in<00:06:07.010> the<00:06:07.130> CPU<00:06:07.640> or

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:07.670 
that it must be somewhere in the CPU or

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:09.970 
that it must be somewhere in the CPU or
the<00:06:07.970> motherboard<00:06:08.450> probably<00:06:09.140> the<00:06:09.260> CPU<00:06:09.680> given

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:09.980 
the motherboard probably the CPU given

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.650 
the motherboard probably the CPU given
that<00:06:10.130> bulldozer<00:06:10.460> is<00:06:10.760> a<00:06:10.790> bit<00:06:11.030> of<00:06:11.120> a<00:06:11.210> power<00:06:11.390> hog

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:11.660 
that bulldozer is a bit of a power hog

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.160 
that bulldozer is a bit of a power hog
we<00:06:12.650> are<00:06:12.800> using<00:06:13.070> more<00:06:13.610> power<00:06:13.910> than<00:06:14.240> the<00:06:14.330> 3930k

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:15.170 
we are using more power than the 3930k

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:17.920 
we are using more power than the 3930k
intel<00:06:15.830> 6<00:06:16.400> cora<00:06:16.670> unlocked<00:06:17.120> processor<00:06:17.750> on<00:06:17.900> the

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:17.930 
intel 6 cora unlocked processor on the

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.490 
intel 6 cora unlocked processor on the
LGA<00:06:18.290> 2011<00:06:18.410> platform<00:06:19.720> and<00:06:20.720> I<00:06:20.840> think<00:06:21.320> that

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:21.500 
LGA 2011 platform and I think that

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.490 
LGA 2011 platform and I think that
pretty<00:06:21.650> much<00:06:21.770> wraps<00:06:21.920> it<00:06:22.250> up<00:06:22.340> so<00:06:22.550> in<00:06:22.760> conclusion

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:23.500 
pretty much wraps it up so in conclusion

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.560 
pretty much wraps it up so in conclusion
no<00:06:24.500> there's<00:06:24.920> no<00:06:25.130> real<00:06:25.430> advantage<00:06:25.610> to<00:06:26.030> pairing

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:26.570 
no there's no real advantage to pairing

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:28.750 
no there's no real advantage to pairing

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:31.550 
get like this wicked like matching color
