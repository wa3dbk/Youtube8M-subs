00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.370
 car 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:08.910
 the characteristics of self-compacting concrete 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.379
 they are best exploited if applied to one you think designed 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:15.369
 installment calculation is done 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:17.689
 using scc 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:19.150
 an interesting example 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.099
 is the new building of the Bocconi University of Milan 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:24.050
 an important achievement 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.749
 right in the city center 

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:29.709
 which represents an example of complex construction site works in which the 

00:00:29.709 --> 00:00:33.789
 self-compacting concrete also plays an important role in terms of 

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:34.880
 quantity 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.270
 about 16 thousand cubic meters used for the construction of all the structures 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.560
 in elevation 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:46.100
 the structure is composed of imposing septa over 20 meters high on which one is 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.370
 engage the various building bodies 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.000
 ccsvi in ​​the central part 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.280
 the main floors hanging from tie-rods suspended from the top beams 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.460
 building 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.180
 - solar and 7 dividers are prestressed 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.180
 self-compacting class strength concretes were used 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.720
 rck 35 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.440
 insects and part of the floors 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.300
 rck 55 pearls traffic and the other solar 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.770
 the association between scci prestressing 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.250
 allowed an optimal sizing of the structures to the advantage of the spaces 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.250
 interior and the quantity of materials used 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.060
 in high performance structures the certainty of the result of the 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.970
 material placed in work 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.810
 uniformity of performance throughout the structure and also the component 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.750
 aesthetics of the surface appearance 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.340
 by comparison with the statistical distribution of resistance results 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.300
 of an ordinary concrete lipari the nominal existence 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.760
 it is noted that scc reaches higher average resistance values ​​and one 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.240
 dispersion of the most contained results 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.550
 and this already in the comparison on the samples taken before the operations of 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:02.800
 plaster 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.020
 the absence of release in the implementation will guarantee a further strong 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.079
 advantage in terms of homogeneity of the concrete characteristics 

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:13.059
 infusing in the designer 

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:14.709
 in the construction manager 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.549
 the tester keeps the customer 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:20.549
 the tranquility of the final result 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:24.760
 scc allowed to set up a program of acceptance checks 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.049
 applied to 100% of the supply 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:31.369
 to ensure compliance of on-site services 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.430
 normal industrial formworks have been used with the right ones 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.729
 care in assembling sealing and use of disarming liquids 

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:46.789
 pumping even at high altitudes has not caused scc problems 

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:49.789
 which made hygiene operations simple and quick 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:55.040
 the presence of areas with a high density of reinforcement and the heads of the cases of 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.239
 prestressing 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.239
 did not create any difficulty in sliding to the concrete 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:03.199
 which has reached the ideal degree of compaction 

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:06.199
 is. of the structure 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:08.870
 hello yes
