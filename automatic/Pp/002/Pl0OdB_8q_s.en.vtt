00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:50.999 
thing with creating these types of loops

00:00:50.999 --> 00:00:53.899 
thing with creating these types of loops
is<00:00:51.269> simply<00:00:52.140> practice<00:00:52.649> getting<00:00:53.399> your<00:00:53.640> hands

00:01:07.819 --> 00:01:07.829 
need needle nose pliers you cannot not

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:09.920 
need needle nose pliers you cannot not
you<00:01:08.340> can't<00:01:08.610> do<00:01:08.790> this<00:01:08.939> with<00:01:09.180> any<00:01:09.420> other<00:01:09.630> kind<00:01:09.869> of

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
on top of that seed bead and then you

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.490 
on top of that seed bead and then you
want<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.020> bend<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.469> wire<00:01:19.680> back<00:01:20.070> towards<00:01:20.579> you

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
want to bend the wire back towards you

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.069 
want to bend the wire back towards you
then<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:22.770> want<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.130> grip<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:24.240> wire<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.810> little

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:25.079 
then you want to grip the wire a little

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:28.069 
then you want to grip the wire a little
further<00:01:25.469> down<00:01:26.149> so<00:01:27.149> that<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.390> haven't<00:01:27.750> the

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:28.079 
further down so that you haven't the

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:32.060 
further down so that you haven't the
actual<00:01:29.090> width<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:31.020> needle<00:01:31.530> nose<00:01:31.710> pliers

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
actual width of the needle nose pliers

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.950 
actual width of the needle nose pliers
is<00:01:32.310> actually<00:01:32.670> going<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:33.030> make<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.570> width<00:01:33.810> of

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
is actually going to make the width of

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.480 
is actually going to make the width of
the<00:01:34.110> hole<00:01:34.439> that<00:01:34.710> you're<00:01:34.860> creating<00:01:35.280> so<00:01:35.430> you

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
the hole that you're creating so you

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.490 
the hole that you're creating so you
want<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.789> create<00:01:35.969> a<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:36.840> know<00:01:36.960> not<00:01:37.079> a<00:01:37.140> huge

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
want to create a you know not a huge

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.830 
want to create a you know not a huge
hole<00:01:37.770> but<00:01:38.100> one<00:01:38.280> that's<00:01:38.570> comparable<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.719> the

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
hole but one that's comparable to the

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.440 
hole but one that's comparable to the
size<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.380> bead<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:41.030> so<00:01:42.030> then<00:01:42.180> you're<00:01:42.270> just

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
size of the bead and so then you're just

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.420 
size of the bead and so then you're just
going<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.840> take<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.320> wire<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.560> bend<00:01:44.250> it

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
going to take the wire and bend it

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.889 
going to take the wire and bend it
around<00:01:46.189> the<00:01:47.189> pliers<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:48.409> as<00:01:49.409> you<00:01:49.710> bend<00:01:49.950> around

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
around the pliers and as you bend around

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:54.440 
around the pliers and as you bend around
it<00:01:51.899> will<00:01:52.320> do<00:01:52.469> the<00:01:52.619> curve<00:01:52.859> for<00:01:53.159> you<00:01:53.340> so<00:01:54.270> this<00:01:54.390> is

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
it will do the curve for you so this is

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.349 
it will do the curve for you so this is
what<00:01:54.689> this<00:01:54.810> is<00:01:54.990> going<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.229> look<00:01:55.380> like<00:01:55.590> so

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:56.359 
what this is going to look like so

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:59.270 
what this is going to look like so
you've<00:01:57.359> got<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.630> pretty<00:01:57.899> nice<00:01:58.079> curve<00:01:58.500> here<00:01:59.100> and

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
you've got a pretty nice curve here and

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.800 
you've got a pretty nice curve here and
the<00:02:00.030> wire<00:02:00.210> is<00:02:00.420> ready<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.929> wrap<00:02:01.259> around<00:02:01.759> on<00:02:02.810> top

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
the wire is ready to wrap around on top

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.260

of the seed bead so again we're gonna
grip<00:02:06.710> you<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:07.890> grip<00:02:08.009> this<00:02:08.160> pretty<00:02:08.399> tight<00:02:08.640> and

grip you and grip this pretty tight and
just<00:02:09.000> use<00:02:09.210> your<00:02:09.240> fingers<00:02:09.420> to<00:02:11.060> pull<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.540> wire

around

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:19.079 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:21.929 

this<00:02:20.079> is<00:02:20.290> pretty<00:02:20.469> soft<00:02:20.709> wire<00:02:20.950> so<00:02:21.370> it<00:02:21.640> should<00:02:21.819> be

00:02:21.929 --> 00:02:21.939 
this is pretty soft wire so it should be

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:26.459 
this is pretty soft wire so it should be
pretty<00:02:22.209> easy<00:02:22.299> to<00:02:22.719> do<00:02:22.930> and<00:02:24.840> so<00:02:25.840> that's<00:02:26.049> the<00:02:26.230> wrap

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:26.469 
pretty easy to do and so that's the wrap

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:28.410

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:30.219 
start going around six or seven times it

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:32.759 
start going around six or seven times it
looks<00:02:30.400> a<00:02:30.489> little<00:02:30.609> funny<00:02:31.000> and<00:02:31.439> then<00:02:32.439> you<00:02:32.590> want
