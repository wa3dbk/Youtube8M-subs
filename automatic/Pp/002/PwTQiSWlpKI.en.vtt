defender does so let me just show you a
some<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.560> aspects<00:01:46.860> as<00:01:46.950> far<00:01:47.130> as

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
some of the aspects as far as

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.340 
some of the aspects as far as
accessibility<00:01:47.460> tools<00:01:48.000> so<00:01:48.600> on<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.930> top<00:01:49.110> here

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
accessibility tools so on the top here

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.889 
accessibility tools so on the top here
and<00:01:49.729> and<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:50.909> would<00:01:51.090> probably<00:01:51.390> say<00:01:51.600> that<00:01:51.720> this

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
and and I would probably say that this

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.039 
and and I would probably say that this
is<00:01:52.049> pretty<00:01:52.259> I<00:01:53.299> wants<00:01:54.299> a<00:01:54.390> waterproof<00:01:54.869> it's

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
is pretty I wants a waterproof it's

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.539 
is pretty I wants a waterproof it's
different<00:01:55.350> it's<00:01:55.500> not<00:01:55.619> waterproof<00:01:55.920> but<00:01:56.340> if

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
different it's not waterproof but if

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:57.889 
different it's not waterproof but if
you're<00:01:56.700> maybe<00:01:56.909> two<00:01:57.060> drops<00:01:57.270> in<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.540> water<00:01:57.570> you

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
you're maybe two drops in the water you

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.569 
you're maybe two drops in the water you
copy<00:01:58.110> you<00:01:58.560> if<00:01:58.799> you<00:01:58.890> pull<00:01:59.040> out<00:01:59.070> fast<00:01:59.369> enough<00:01:59.460> you

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
copy you if you pull out fast enough you

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.359 
copy you if you pull out fast enough you
probably<00:01:59.909> could<00:02:00.090> probably<00:02:00.930> could<00:02:01.229> avoid<00:02:02.159> any

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
probably could probably could avoid any

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.740 
probably could probably could avoid any
kind<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.579> damage<00:02:02.820> screen<00:02:03.149> cost<00:02:03.329> get<00:02:03.540> iphone

with big fingers like me I don't have a

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.550 
with big fingers like me I don't have a
problem<00:03:11.700> switching<00:03:12.270> it<00:03:12.540> on<00:03:12.600> and<00:03:12.750> off<00:03:12.810> pretty

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
problem switching it on and off pretty

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.410 
problem switching it on and off pretty
easily<00:03:13.710> so<00:03:14.340> I<00:03:14.370> really<00:03:14.850> think<00:03:15.000> that's<00:03:15.240> an

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
easily so I really think that's an

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.180 
easily so I really think that's an
awesome<00:03:15.570> picture<00:03:15.960> that<00:03:16.140> they<00:03:16.260> are<00:03:16.410> I<00:03:16.650> did<00:03:17.100> this

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
awesome picture that they are I did this

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
awesome picture that they are I did this
one<00:03:17.340> of<00:03:17.430> the<00:03:17.490> reasons<00:03:17.730> I<00:03:17.790> couldn't<00:03:18.030> use<00:03:18.120> my

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.210 
one of the reasons I couldn't use my

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.690 
one of the reasons I couldn't use my
otterbox<00:03:18.660> very<00:03:19.050> much<00:03:19.230> especially<00:03:20.010> in<00:03:20.370> an

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
otterbox very much especially in an

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.130 
otterbox very much especially in an
office<00:03:21.000> setting<00:03:21.180> because<00:03:21.450> I<00:03:21.570> have<00:03:21.930> to<00:03:21.960> put<00:03:22.110> my

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
office setting because I have to put my

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.230 
office setting because I have to put my
phone<00:03:22.410> into<00:03:22.680> sounded<00:03:23.130> pretty<00:03:23.490> often<00:03:23.700> so<00:03:23.910> I

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:24.240 
phone into sounded pretty often so I

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.520 
phone into sounded pretty often so I
wasn't<00:03:24.660> able<00:03:24.810> to<00:03:24.930> do<00:03:25.050> that<00:03:25.170> when<00:03:25.290> I<00:03:25.320> was<00:03:25.380> in<00:03:25.470> the

wasn't able to do that when I was in the

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.080 
wasn't able to do that when I was in the
case<00:03:25.710> so<00:03:26.280> then<00:03:26.430> we<00:03:26.520> go<00:03:26.610> to<00:03:26.670> the<00:03:26.730> bottom<00:03:26.850> here

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090

this is that obviously it has to be a

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.840 
this is that obviously it has to be a
certain<00:03:54.660> shape<00:03:55.020> you<00:03:55.740> know<00:03:55.830> to<00:03:55.890> fit<00:03:56.250> the

that square shape I had two other

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.070 
that square shape I had two other
connectors<00:04:11.640> that<00:04:11.700> I<00:04:11.820> used<00:04:12.060> and<00:04:12.510> which<00:04:12.840> one<00:04:13.050> of

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
connectors that I used and which one of

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.210 
connectors that I used and which one of

them is the one that came with the
iphone<00:04:14.520> that<00:04:14.670> fits<00:04:14.850> fine<00:04:15.060> and<00:04:15.270> the<00:04:15.330> other<00:04:15.450> one

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
iphone that fits fine and the other one

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:16.729 
iphone that fits fine and the other one
fits<00:04:15.780> fine<00:04:16.080> as<00:04:16.200> well<00:04:16.290> but<00:04:16.410> has<00:04:16.530> to<00:04:16.620> be<00:04:16.709> a

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
fits fine as well but has to be a

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.920 
fits fine as well but has to be a
certain<00:04:16.890> shape<00:04:17.190> to<00:04:17.310> fit<00:04:17.459> in<00:04:17.580> there<00:04:17.730> so<00:04:18.450> there's

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
certain shape to fit in there so there's

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.120 
certain shape to fit in there so there's
one<00:04:19.080> down<00:04:19.260> side<00:04:19.440> you<00:04:19.620> have<00:04:19.770> to<00:04:19.859> keep<00:04:19.979> in<00:04:20.100> mind

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
one down side you have to keep in mind

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.250 
one down side you have to keep in mind
and<00:04:20.370> be<00:04:20.460> aware<00:04:20.669> of<00:04:20.729> not<00:04:21.540> all<00:04:21.690> your<00:04:21.870> connectors

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
and be aware of not all your connectors

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.070 
and be aware of not all your connectors
will<00:04:22.410> fit<00:04:22.560> when<00:04:22.710> it's<00:04:22.830> in

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
will fit when it's in

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.170 
will fit when it's in
so<00:04:25.080> that<00:04:25.770> is<00:04:25.980> that<00:04:26.190> and<00:04:26.370> also<00:04:26.520> i'm<00:04:26.940> going<00:04:27.120> to

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
so that is that and also i'm going to

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.300 
so that is that and also i'm going to
show<00:04:27.270> you<00:04:27.330> the<00:04:27.450> other<00:04:27.770> get<00:04:28.770> a<00:04:28.800> cover<00:04:29.070> right

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
show you the other get a cover right

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.640 
show you the other get a cover right
here<00:04:29.580> for<00:04:30.570> that<00:04:30.720> so<00:04:30.960> water<00:04:31.170> won't<00:04:31.350> get<00:04:31.500> to

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
here for that so water won't get to

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.290 
here for that so water won't get to
there<00:04:31.770> as<00:04:31.890> well<00:04:32.040> and<00:04:32.160> also<00:04:32.460> the<00:04:32.730> sensor<00:04:33.150> is

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
there as well and also the sensor is

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.150 
there as well and also the sensor is
being<00:04:33.480> exposed<00:04:33.840> so<00:04:34.110> the<00:04:34.260> proximity<00:04:34.800> and<00:04:35.070> the

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
being exposed so the proximity and the

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.860 
being exposed so the proximity and the
light<00:04:35.310> sensor<00:04:35.670> are<00:04:36.210> not<00:04:36.390> been<00:04:36.540> blocked<00:04:36.750> off

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
light sensor are not been blocked off

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.500 
light sensor are not been blocked off
and<00:04:37.170> it<00:04:37.620> also<00:04:37.770> has<00:04:37.920> a<00:04:38.460> film<00:04:39.120> with<00:04:39.240> a<00:04:39.270> plastic

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
and it also has a film with a plastic

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.510 
and it also has a film with a plastic
film<00:04:39.960> built<00:04:40.260> into<00:04:40.530> it<00:04:40.620> so<00:04:40.650> it's<00:04:41.100> protecting

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
film built into it so it's protecting

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.830 
film built into it so it's protecting
your<00:04:41.640> screen<00:04:41.850> as<00:04:41.940> well<00:04:42.060> from<00:04:42.300> scratches<00:04:42.810> and

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
your screen as well from scratches and

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.950 
your screen as well from scratches and
that's<00:04:43.230> everything<00:04:44.120> so<00:04:45.120> obviously<00:04:45.510> this<00:04:45.780> is<00:04:45.930> a

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
that's everything so obviously this is a

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.720 
that's everything so obviously this is a
pretty<00:04:46.170> hardcore<00:04:46.470> case<00:04:46.830> otterbox<00:04:47.100> come<00:04:47.610> out

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:47.730 
pretty hardcore case otterbox come out

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:50.690 
pretty hardcore case otterbox come out
with<00:04:48.590> like<00:04:49.590> i<00:04:49.710> said<00:04:49.860> before<00:04:49.950> i<00:04:50.160> think<00:04:50.370> it'll<00:04:50.490> do

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
with like i said before i think it'll do

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.100 
with like i said before i think it'll do
probably<00:04:51.060> the<00:04:51.150> best<00:04:51.360> I've<00:04:51.570> out<00:04:51.690> of<00:04:51.720> any<00:04:51.900> case

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
probably the best I've out of any case

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.260 
probably the best I've out of any case
I've<00:04:52.260> ever<00:04:52.320> seen<00:04:52.620> as<00:04:52.740> far<00:04:52.950> as<00:04:53.040> protecting<00:04:53.910> your

about I made one millimeter thicker so
its<00:05:08.580> real<00:05:08.820> thick<00:05:09.030> and<00:05:09.420> but<00:05:10.050> as<00:05:10.140> you<00:05:10.260> can<00:05:10.350> see<00:05:10.500> it

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
its real thick and but as you can see it

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.860 
its real thick and but as you can see it
does<00:05:10.800> sometimes<00:05:10.980> bubble<00:05:11.400> up<00:05:11.520> a<00:05:11.610> little<00:05:11.790> bit<00:05:11.910> as

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
does sometimes bubble up a little bit as

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.500 
does sometimes bubble up a little bit as
you<00:05:12.930> can<00:05:13.170> it's<00:05:13.440> kind<00:05:13.650> of<00:05:13.740> happen<00:05:14.070> right<00:05:14.160> there

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:14.510 
you can it's kind of happen right there

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:17.210 
you can it's kind of happen right there
so<00:05:15.510> and<00:05:15.990> you<00:05:16.230> know<00:05:16.320> obviously<00:05:16.560> you<00:05:16.860> can't

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
so and you know obviously you can't

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.260 
so and you know obviously you can't
really<00:05:17.340> tell<00:05:17.580> whenever<00:05:17.850> you<00:05:17.970> press<00:05:18.090> the

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
really tell whenever you press the

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:19.580 
really tell whenever you press the
button<00:05:18.300> it<00:05:18.660> kind<00:05:18.840> of<00:05:18.870> goes<00:05:18.990> away<00:05:19.170> a<00:05:19.290> little<00:05:19.470> bit

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
button it kind of goes away a little bit

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.710 
button it kind of goes away a little bit
so<00:05:19.890> it<00:05:19.950> disappears<00:05:20.070> but<00:05:21.060> when<00:05:21.240> it's<00:05:21.360> not<00:05:21.510> being

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
so it disappears but when it's not being

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.740 
so it disappears but when it's not being
used<00:05:22.220> it<00:05:23.220> is<00:05:23.400> a<00:05:23.580> little<00:05:24.210> obvious<00:05:24.420> right<00:05:24.690> there

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.750 
used it is a little obvious right there

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:26.750 
used it is a little obvious right there
so<00:05:25.080> you<00:05:25.140> can<00:05:25.260> see<00:05:25.410> that<00:05:25.440> and<00:05:25.980> it<00:05:26.370> does<00:05:26.490> come

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
so you can see that and it does come

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.060

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:31.110 
can't really somethin before this one

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:32.840

you could do either way you can put it
in<00:06:32.970> this<00:06:33.060> way<00:06:33.270> you<00:06:33.300> can<00:06:33.660> that<00:06:33.780> labor<00:06:34.020> knows<00:06:34.229> at

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:34.890 
in this way you can that labor knows at

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:35.290 
in this way you can that labor knows at
least<00:06:34.950> what

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:35.300 
least what

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.909 
least what
mind<00:06:35.449> if<00:06:35.690> I<00:06:35.780> put<00:06:35.930> it<00:06:36.020> in<00:06:36.050> this<00:06:36.169> way<00:06:36.349> snaps<00:06:36.740> out

00:06:36.909 --> 00:06:36.919

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:38.810 
really easily it doesn't really stay in

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:40.839 
really easily it doesn't really stay in
place<00:06:38.990> very<00:06:39.229> well<00:06:39.379> so<00:06:39.949> if<00:06:40.310> you<00:06:40.430> want<00:06:40.639> to<00:06:40.789> be
