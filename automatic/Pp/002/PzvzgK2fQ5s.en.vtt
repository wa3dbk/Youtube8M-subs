00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:32.430
 you can not do that, you do not have to do it 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:35.130
 in fact, the rail cargo pack is 1 point 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.220

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.640
 just look in the menu and look us 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.750
 Just let's say we're here 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.229
 different thing and there you see 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.720
 beautiful 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.290
 yes of course that is already known 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.390
 the here also the Mars 535 was also 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.399
 ever in the game that's on everyone 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.530
 If the silo I know every one 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.170
 I do not have a bagger here yet 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.000
 Just go round about Iran 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.649
 here I mean with all the skins 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.260
 that is as different as we go 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.420
 just go here 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.799
 this is known from the original game 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.069
 I have already seen and before 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:20.720
 this trailer who does not play that 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.430
 Farming simulator that gives 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.739
 of course also original from the 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.569
 land hit simulator is almost 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.670
 the gema continue what we see 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.319
 here are four different caterpillars 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:34.549
 I know the trailer I know 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:36.680
 is also more and more animal hand holds the 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:38.870
 In any case , I express it 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.109
 In any case, really nice is new 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:44.299
 We also have to go 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:47.989
 Let's continue that, for example, a new one 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:50.440
 lok diesel locomotive was already in there 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:53.480
 So many things are natural 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:56.030
 adapted ic3 for the latest version 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.040
 but there are many many 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.500
 new skins I think one has on 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.870
 this worked already look in here 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.510
 new holland trek here on top of everyone 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.159
 case very interesting what do you see here 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.790
 means that for example a whole 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:12.280
 Other trailer that was otherwise here in front 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:15.669
 dark red I would almost mean now 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:18.859
 Here is also new 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:21.040
 which are also new here are all the 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:25.790
 we all new I would now almost my 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:28.669
 Ikea because I had me extra things so 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.349

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:36.319
 a container dr ecet ec3 so here 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:39.019
 It is definitely a lot 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:40.549
 at the bar and you go in berlin look 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:44.030
 What was it going to be here? 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:46.579
 every case a nice tracked excavator and 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:51.650
 what is there still beautiful krombacher 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:52.629
 Here again a bagger so what is that 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.000
 because 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:57.680
 and I mean that with different ones 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.510
 different trailer types and 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.569
 sorry i am maybe now 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.069
 to hit because her yes then give 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:08.900
 but also in the profile 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:11.299
 there shows up normal just is it 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.609
 then everything runs like that knows 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:15.709
 one already with the buses here that is 

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:18.530
 the military mod and there are two 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:21.049
 once you can do different 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.430
 choose english or russian and me 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.430
 of course I have for the English 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.690
 version so 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:29.460
 then there are two different ones 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.740
 the colors with the trucks you know that 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:35.789
 that too is of course here 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:39.449
 the trains again two files and 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:42.090
 there are three for the trailer in chaos 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:43.919
 in fact, many are English 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.080
 I did not take over the version 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:48.180
 I have already in it and I think 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.750
 it's nice that now slowly the whole 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:55.830
 pictures are present in the game so 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.940
 always go back to the game and 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.710
 just drive a little one 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.199
 round 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:02.550
 maybe we will somehow see something 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:04.229
 extraordinary because he also has a 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:08.190
 company what was changed 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:13.530
 Maybe we'll see something so marina like that 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:15.800
 continue and now are only 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.180
 times all trucks purpose 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.909
 we just drive a little round 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:22.340
 here through the city of berlin 

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:23.270
 You know that and that's the way I'm gonna do it 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.530
 then introduce 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:30.259
 again and again when new packages from mine 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:31.849
 favorite place manufacturer at the start 

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:34.729
 and yes now if there are some 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:36.470
 ask other trucks last time was still 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:38.210
 an end but still with such a 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.819
 similar paint that of course 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:42.770
 the multiplayer paint job is always 

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:44.180
 not yet final so i can always 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:45.800
 not yet the multiplayer donated that 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.409
 are for example another truck 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.849
 then this package, too, you have to 

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:52.610
 Just watch the video of 

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:54.139
 this motto goes and if sometimes 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:57.889
 a single comes because which 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:06:01.099
 explicitly introduce it here but now 

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:04.240
 I'm going to become the three of me 

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:06.139
 think that there is something for everyone 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.080
 Of course there was a bit more 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:10.669
 something else than interested me 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.650
 this is also the case with jason kidd 

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:15.830
 Buses Buses Different 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:18.669
 start are resourceful nice and i will 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:21.770
 Show me where I am soon 

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:26.900
 the euro coach simulator games 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:29.820
 you know what I mean by my july 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:34.740
 that's nice bus 

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:36.570
 new drive back and then are 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:38.220
 We're back at the start here again 

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:40.860
 bus my goodness drive here but many 

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:44.610
 improvements of this roma is of course the 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:48.390
 change that not so many now 

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:50.250
 cars at the start are four you can see 

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:52.370
 for example what she meant 

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:55.620
 that in the last video that the 

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:57.660
 Paint and the trucks will be adjusted 

00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:02.550
 also similar is this 

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:03.090
 paint cottbus say now and that fits 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:07.410
 but very good 

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:09.650
 the trailer I have to be honest 

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:11.480
 I like saying that 

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:13.830
 different loads 

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:16.920
 military vehicles and trains 

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:19.980
 that has been the big topic in now 

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:22.500
 this place package and yes I would 

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:24.180
 make this place in cut and me 

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:27.090
 hope you had fun with it 

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:29.150
