black is in fall color this droid you

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.930 
black is in fall color this droid you
locate<00:02:21.040> colors<00:02:22.020> okay<00:02:23.020> so<00:02:23.650> this<00:02:23.830> is<00:02:24.070> the<00:02:24.640> mask

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
we are applying here and that will

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:33.539 
we are applying here and that will
engage<00:02:27.700> the<00:02:28.300> image<00:02:28.810> from<00:02:29.140> the<00:02:29.290> background<00:02:32.549> so

engage the image from the background so

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:35.970 
engage the image from the background so
now<00:02:33.730> similarly<00:02:34.660> if<00:02:34.870> here<00:02:35.410> if<00:02:35.650> there

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
now similarly if here if there

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.890 
now similarly if here if there
accidentally<00:02:36.459> fall<00:02:36.790> color<00:02:37.030> is<00:02:37.269> foil<00:02:37.600> and<00:02:37.750> back

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
accidentally fall color is foil and back

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.050 
accidentally fall color is foil and back
color<00:02:38.140> is<00:02:39.209> black<00:02:40.209> we<00:02:40.959> can<00:02:41.110> exchange<00:02:41.380> that<00:02:41.799> way

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
color is black we can exchange that way

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.009 
color is black we can exchange that way
xk<00:02:43.060> i'm<00:02:43.510> pressing<00:02:43.959> here<00:02:44.260> x.x<00:02:45.239> so<00:02:46.239> this<00:02:46.510> accents

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
xk i'm pressing here x.x so this accents

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:49.050 
xk i'm pressing here x.x so this accents
the<00:02:47.140> color<00:02:47.350> if<00:02:47.650> white<00:02:48.280> color<00:02:48.519> isn't<00:02:48.730> powerful

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
the color if white color isn't powerful

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.900 
the color if white color isn't powerful
then<00:02:49.480> we<00:02:49.600> can<00:02:49.840> just<00:02:50.080> get<00:02:50.680> the<00:02:51.250> reverse<00:02:51.580> of<00:02:51.850> that

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
then we can just get the reverse of that

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.670 
then we can just get the reverse of that
so<00:02:52.750> it<00:02:53.730> decreases<00:02:54.730> the<00:02:55.269> mask<00:02:55.510> so<00:02:56.350> now<00:02:56.500> i'm

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
so it decreases the mask so now i'm

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.600 
so it decreases the mask so now i'm
going<00:02:56.709> to<00:02:57.400> apply<00:02:57.670> mask<00:02:58.209> here<00:02:59.040> okay

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
going to apply mask here okay

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.380 
going to apply mask here okay
just<00:03:03.160> drag<00:03:04.160> it<00:03:04.220> on<00:03:04.520> the<00:03:04.670> idea<00:03:04.880> where<00:03:05.150> we<00:03:05.210> want

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
just drag it on the idea where we want

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.940 
just drag it on the idea where we want
to<00:03:05.450> get<00:03:05.690> column<00:03:06.320> this<00:03:08.140> is<00:03:09.140> a<00:03:09.170> very<00:03:09.410> easy<00:03:09.560> to

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
to get column this is a very easy to

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:38.110 
to get column this is a very easy to
deal<00:03:10.280> to<00:03:10.550> do<00:03:10.670> in<00:03:10.820> Photoshop

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:04:06.930 

okay<00:03:38.720> here's<00:03:39.409> some<00:03:39.799> persons<00:03:40.280> many

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.960 

okay<00:04:07.540> as<00:04:07.840> we<00:04:08.080> see<00:04:08.350> here<00:04:08.380> are<00:04:09.040> some<00:04:09.250> person<00:04:09.760> that

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
okay as we see here are some person that

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.170 
okay as we see here are some person that
we<00:04:10.150> got<00:04:10.780> extra<00:04:11.230> so<00:04:11.830> we<00:04:11.980> can<00:04:12.160> just<00:04:12.310> access<00:04:12.520> color

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
we got extra so we can just access color

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:21.360 
we got extra so we can just access color
here<00:04:13.570> and<00:04:15.900> remove<00:04:16.900> them

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:28.890 

okay<00:04:23.070> here<00:04:24.070> also

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.390 

so<00:04:29.440> this<00:04:29.650> is<00:04:29.830> a<00:04:30.840> separate<00:04:31.840> column<00:04:32.320> from<00:04:33.160> more

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
so this is a separate column from more

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.979 
so this is a separate column from more
black<00:04:34.120> and<00:04:34.150> white<00:04:34.449> picture<00:04:34.979> assault
