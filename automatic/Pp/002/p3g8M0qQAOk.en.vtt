very simply we're just gonna do basic

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.950 
very simply we're just gonna do basic
step<00:01:12.210> where<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.390> would<00:01:12.479> look<00:01:12.810> like<00:01:12.960> 1<00:01:13.770> 2<00:01:14.310> 3<00:01:14.900> 5<00:01:15.900> 6

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
here we go for the basic step 1 2 3 5 6

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:34.790 
here we go for the basic step 1 2 3 5 6
7<00:01:29.310> 1<00:01:29.940> 2<00:01:30.240> 3<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:31.259> double<00:01:31.619> spin<00:01:31.860> 5<00:01:32.729> 6<00:01:33.360> 7<00:01:33.990> ok<00:01:34.140> and

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:34.800 
7 1 2 3 and double spin 5 6 7 ok and

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.990 
7 1 2 3 and double spin 5 6 7 ok and
then<00:01:35.460> just<00:01:35.820> finish<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.180> off<00:01:36.330> 1<00:01:37.140> 2<00:01:37.590> 3<00:01:38.009> ok<00:01:38.280> now<00:01:38.940> you

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
then just finish it off 1 2 3 ok now you

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.090 
then just finish it off 1 2 3 ok now you
can<00:01:39.180> do<00:01:39.390> this<00:01:39.570> in<00:01:39.930> multiple<00:01:40.110> places<00:01:40.410> right

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
can do this in multiple places right

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.190 
can do this in multiple places right
I<00:01:41.130> knew<00:01:41.910> this<00:01:42.030> in<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.240> hammerlock<00:01:42.570> turn<00:01:42.930> right

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
I knew this in a hammerlock turn right

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.320 
I knew this in a hammerlock turn right
so<00:01:43.440> simple<00:01:44.400> hammerlock<00:01:44.820> turn<00:01:45.030> would<00:01:45.210> look

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
so simple hammerlock turn would look

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:51.770 
so simple hammerlock turn would look
like<00:01:45.479> 1<00:01:46.410> 2<00:01:46.950> 3<00:01:47.540> 5<00:01:48.540> 6<00:01:49.080> 7<00:01:49.320> ok<00:01:50.119> now<00:01:51.119> when<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.600> have<00:01:51.720> a

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
like 1 2 3 5 6 7 ok now when you have a

like 1 2 3 5 6 7 ok now when you have a
person<00:01:52.200> that<00:01:52.229> can<00:01:52.770> spin<00:01:53.040> it's<00:01:53.399> like<00:01:53.550> Julie

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
person that can spin it's like Julie

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.480 
person that can spin it's like Julie

a<00:03:58.230> bit<00:03:58.260> because<00:03:58.949> of<00:03:59.160> course<00:03:59.400> it<00:03:59.790> only<00:03:59.940> makes

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
a bit because of course it only makes

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.490 
a bit because of course it only makes
sense<00:04:00.239> to<00:04:00.480> actually<00:04:00.780> drop<00:04:00.900> to<00:04:01.079> the<00:04:01.169> other<00:04:01.290> hand

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
sense to actually drop to the other hand

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.849 
sense to actually drop to the other hand
at<00:04:01.620> that<00:04:01.650> point<00:04:02.010> okay<00:04:02.519> now<00:04:03.030> doing<00:04:03.389> this<00:04:03.480> with

at that point okay now doing this with

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:06.860 
at that point okay now doing this with
better<00:04:04.859> counts<00:04:05.250> we<00:04:06.209> come<00:04:06.389> forward<00:04:06.569> for<00:04:06.810> the

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
better counts we come forward for the

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.670 
better counts we come forward for the
basic<00:04:07.139> step<00:04:07.349> one<00:04:08.160> two<00:04:08.639> three<00:04:09.209> five<00:04:09.959> six<00:04:10.019> seven

this<00:04:24.539> is<00:04:24.599> a<00:04:24.780> little<00:04:24.960> bit<00:04:25.139> weird<00:04:25.320> if<00:04:25.560> you're

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
this is a little bit weird if you're

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.189 
this is a little bit weird if you're
gonna<00:04:25.889> do<00:04:26.130> a<00:04:26.729> double<00:04:27.419> turn<00:04:27.599> here<00:04:27.960> though

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:28.199 
gonna do a double turn here though

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:29.450 
gonna do a double turn here though
usually<00:04:28.410> if<00:04:28.800> you<00:04:28.889> have<00:04:28.919> a<00:04:29.039> good<00:04:29.159> spitter

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
usually if you have a good spitter

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.570 
usually if you have a good spitter
they'll<00:04:29.669> be<00:04:29.820> able<00:04:29.909> to<00:04:30.030> spin<00:04:31.130> what<00:04:32.130> you<00:04:32.280> want<00:04:32.490> to

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
they'll be able to spin what you want to

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.570 
they'll be able to spin what you want to
do<00:04:32.699> is<00:04:32.880> after<00:04:33.090> you<00:04:33.330> do<00:04:33.419> one<00:04:34.289> two<00:04:34.800> three<00:04:35.340> you

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
do is after you do one two three you

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:36.890 
do is after you do one two three you
know<00:04:35.699> that<00:04:35.940> you<00:04:36.120> couldn't<00:04:36.449> have<00:04:36.539> prepped<00:04:36.750> the

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
know that you couldn't have prepped the

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.439 
know that you couldn't have prepped the
lady<00:04:37.110> okay<00:04:37.530> so<00:04:38.130> sometimes<00:04:38.460> if<00:04:39.150> you<00:04:39.270> have<00:04:39.300> a

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:39.449 
lady okay so sometimes if you have a

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:41.510 
lady okay so sometimes if you have a
good<00:04:39.690> spinner<00:04:39.960> she<00:04:40.590> can<00:04:40.800> get<00:04:40.979> away<00:04:41.070> with<00:04:41.370> doing

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
good spinner she can get away with doing

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.159 
good spinner she can get away with doing
double<00:04:41.909> spins<00:04:42.150> without<00:04:42.479> actually<00:04:42.810> having<00:04:42.960> a

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169 
double spins without actually having a

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:45.080 
double spins without actually having a
prep<00:04:43.409> sometimes<00:04:44.220> they'll<00:04:44.400> actually<00:04:44.520> do<00:04:44.760> half

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
prep sometimes they'll actually do half

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.520 
prep sometimes they'll actually do half
a<00:04:45.210> prep<00:04:45.479> thinking<00:04:45.930> that<00:04:46.080> there<00:04:46.320> might<00:04:46.500> be

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
a prep thinking that there might be

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.409 
a prep thinking that there might be
multiple<00:04:46.830> spins<00:04:47.280> if<00:04:47.490> the<00:04:47.970> girl<00:04:48.210> actually

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 
multiple spins if the girl actually

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:51.140 
multiple spins if the girl actually
knows<00:04:48.780> that<00:04:49.020> you<00:04:49.260> do<00:04:49.740> multiple<00:04:50.099> spins<00:04:50.340> so<00:04:50.940> from

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
knows that you do multiple spins so from

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.490 
knows that you do multiple spins so from
here<00:04:51.330> instead<00:04:51.539> of<00:04:51.599> course<00:04:51.840> doing<00:04:52.080> just<00:04:52.320> one

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
here instead of course doing just one

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.550 
here instead of course doing just one
spin<00:04:52.770> with<00:04:52.919> two<00:04:53.039> hands<00:04:53.750> okay<00:04:54.750> you<00:04:55.380> can

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
spin with two hands okay you can

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.320 
spin with two hands okay you can
actually<00:04:55.889> do<00:04:56.039> multiple<00:04:56.219> spins<00:04:56.700> okay<00:04:57.060> so<00:04:57.120> here

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
actually do multiple spins okay so here

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:58.610 
actually do multiple spins okay so here
we<00:04:57.389> go<00:04:57.479> four

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
we go four

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.540 
we go four
Wow<00:04:58.880> that<00:04:59.880> three<00:05:00.570> or<00:05:00.660> five<00:05:00.780> six<00:05:00.990> seven<00:05:01.260> so

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
Wow that three or five six seven so

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.890 
Wow that three or five six seven so
putting<00:05:02.550> everything<00:05:02.760> together<00:05:02.940> which<00:05:03.330> is<00:05:03.840> a

putting everything together which is a

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.659 
putting everything together which is a
little<00:05:04.110> bit<00:05:04.199> easier<00:05:04.500> using<00:05:04.889> the<00:05:05.100> momentum<00:05:05.550> in

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669 
little bit easier using the momentum in

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:09.230 
little bit easier using the momentum in
the<00:05:05.760> steps<00:05:06.030> we<00:05:06.510> can<00:05:06.690> do<00:05:06.930> one<00:05:07.860> two<00:05:08.100> three<00:05:08.699> five

okay
another<00:05:22.470> place<00:05:22.650> where<00:05:22.800> you<00:05:22.830> can<00:05:22.919> do<00:05:23.070> multiple

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
another place where you can do multiple

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.260 
another place where you can do multiple
spins<00:05:24.020> instead<00:05:25.020> of<00:05:25.110> doing<00:05:25.380> just<00:05:25.790> a<00:05:26.790> regular

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270 
spins instead of doing just a regular

spins instead of doing just a regular
move<00:05:27.479> where<00:05:27.720> you<00:05:27.810> do<00:05:28.070> one<00:05:29.070> two<00:05:29.370> three<00:05:29.850> with

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000

your left five six seven which you're

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:33.980 
your left five six seven which you're
kind<00:05:32.639> of<00:05:32.699> used<00:05:32.880> to<00:05:32.970> you<00:05:33.570> can<00:05:33.690> do<00:05:33.810> multiple

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
kind of used to you can do multiple

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.830 
kind of used to you can do multiple
spins<00:05:34.470> if<00:05:34.650> you<00:05:34.770> have<00:05:34.860> a<00:05:34.919> pretty<00:05:35.190> good<00:05:35.310> spinner

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 
spins if you have a pretty good spinner

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.400

one two three five six seven okay

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.670 
one two three five six seven okay
same<00:05:41.070> thing<00:05:41.340> with<00:05:41.550> your<00:05:41.940> backhand<00:05:42.229> one<00:05:43.229> two

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 
same thing with your backhand one two

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.370 
same thing with your backhand one two
three<00:05:44.250> five<00:05:45.090> six<00:05:45.150> seven

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380 
three five six seven

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.770 
three five six seven
okay<00:05:46.710> same<00:05:47.460> way<00:05:47.639> all<00:05:48.240> you<00:05:48.419> have<00:05:48.510> to<00:05:48.630> make<00:05:48.660> sure

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 
okay same way all you have to make sure

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.510 
okay same way all you have to make sure
is<00:05:48.960> you're<00:05:49.139> providing<00:05:49.320> them<00:05:49.770> in<00:05:49.919> the<00:05:49.979> momentum

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 
is you're providing them in the momentum

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.360 
is you're providing them in the momentum
to<00:05:51.210> come<00:05:51.419> around<00:05:51.539> of<00:05:52.139> course<00:05:52.229> it<00:05:52.889> doesn't<00:05:53.160> have

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.370 
to come around of course it doesn't have

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:54.950 
to come around of course it doesn't have
a<00:05:53.400> prep<00:05:53.729> so<00:05:54.060> you<00:05:54.150> should<00:05:54.360> probably<00:05:54.510> do<00:05:54.690> it<00:05:54.810> with

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 
a prep so you should probably do it with

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.990 
a prep so you should probably do it with
people<00:05:55.139> who<00:05:55.320> are<00:05:56.010> more<00:05:56.340> used<00:05:56.580> to<00:05:56.729> spinning

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
people who are more used to spinning

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.200 
people who are more used to spinning
maybe<00:05:57.300> double<00:05:57.780> turns<00:05:57.990> without<00:05:58.229> a<00:05:58.380> prep<00:05:58.620> okay

00:05:59.200 --> 00:05:59.210 
maybe double turns without a prep okay

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:02.000 
maybe double turns without a prep okay
one<00:06:00.210> last<00:06:00.449> one<00:06:00.690> is<00:06:00.840> of<00:06:01.260> course<00:06:01.530> it<00:06:01.680> is<00:06:01.800> free

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.010 
one last one is of course it is free

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:03.620 
one last one is of course it is free
spin<00:06:02.340> you<00:06:02.669> can<00:06:02.700> provide<00:06:03.030> the<00:06:03.180> lady<00:06:03.360> to

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:03.630 
spin you can provide the lady to

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:05.330 
spin you can provide the lady to
actually<00:06:04.289> just<00:06:04.470> free<00:06:04.590> spin<00:06:04.860> instead<00:06:05.070> of<00:06:05.190> just

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.340 
actually just free spin instead of just

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.690 
actually just free spin instead of just
one<00:06:05.520> spin<00:06:06.030> very<00:06:07.020> simply<00:06:07.500> a<00:06:07.680> basic<00:06:08.280> free<00:06:08.430> spin

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:08.700 
one spin very simply a basic free spin

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:12.560 
one spin very simply a basic free spin
looks<00:06:08.820> like<00:06:09.150> one<00:06:10.139> two<00:06:10.770> three<00:06:11.490> I<00:06:11.700> just<00:06:12.060> move<00:06:12.419> out

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:12.570 
looks like one two three I just move out

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:17.060 
looks like one two three I just move out
of<00:06:12.599> the<00:06:12.750> way<00:06:13.520> so<00:06:14.520> I<00:06:14.849> step<00:06:15.180> forward<00:06:15.539> one<00:06:16.169> two

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:17.070 
of the way so I step forward one two

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:20.210 
of the way so I step forward one two
three<00:06:18.000> and<00:06:18.270> from<00:06:18.750> this<00:06:19.020> lady<00:06:19.740> has<00:06:19.950> a<00:06:19.979> good

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:20.220 
three and from this lady has a good

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.029 
three and from this lady has a good
frame<00:06:20.520> I<00:06:20.820> can<00:06:21.180> actually<00:06:21.599> pull<00:06:21.900> this<00:06:22.110> like<00:06:23.010> a

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:23.039 
frame I can actually pull this like a

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:26.089 
frame I can actually pull this like a
semicircular<00:06:23.960> semicircle<00:06:24.960> towards<00:06:25.260> me<00:06:25.440> and

00:06:26.089 --> 00:06:26.099 
semicircular semicircle towards me and

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:29.390 
semicircular semicircle towards me and
she'll<00:06:26.280> just<00:06:26.310> do<00:06:26.580> one<00:06:26.789> spin<00:06:27.919> and<00:06:28.919> finish<00:06:29.190> of

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:29.400 
she'll just do one spin and finish of

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.300 
she'll just do one spin and finish of
course<00:06:29.669> now<00:06:30.360> the<00:06:30.419> difference<00:06:30.990> is<00:06:31.139> the<00:06:31.860> harder

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:32.310 
course now the difference is the harder

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:34.730 
course now the difference is the harder
I<00:06:32.340> move<00:06:32.610> this<00:06:32.789> hand<00:06:33.000> and<00:06:33.360> the<00:06:33.990> more<00:06:34.199> I<00:06:34.229> turn<00:06:34.620> it

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:34.740 
I move this hand and the more I turn it

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.680 
I move this hand and the more I turn it
around<00:06:34.800> the<00:06:35.400> more<00:06:35.639> of<00:06:35.849> the<00:06:36.150> spin<00:06:36.389> she<00:06:36.570> can

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:36.690 
around the more of the spin she can

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:37.280 
around the more of the spin she can
actually<00:06:37.020> do

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:37.290 
actually do

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:40.449 
actually do
