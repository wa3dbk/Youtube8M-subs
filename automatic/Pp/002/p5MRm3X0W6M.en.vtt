00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 hello people and welcome back to 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.839
 another gta 4 and ideas 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.919
 Do not be surprised it's like a glass 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.670
 I must necessarily lay shield 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.590
 stir 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.990
 otherwise it will not be so completely afterwards 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.040
 So right, I was hoping that I would not 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.740
 too much, I might just now 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.990
 but I should have taken pictures 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:21.000
 anyway , as I said in the end 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.980
 for the film or the disorder goes 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.260
 comes every monday morningservice 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.279
 monday wednesday friday and now too 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.230
 sunday at 16 o'clock 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.810
 and who my new series and indeed 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:35.250
 Concretely, the contact is not just planned 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.620
 so that then yes this week the 2015 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.690
 or 15 weeks is in science and 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.489
 Research comes after the Chevrolet Tahoe 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:47.129
 Police after the police yesterday 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:52.949
 days spokesman on Monday today the the 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:55.949
 the 2015 Ford mustang that the mod 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.020
 is unfortunately experiencing several textures so 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.309
 more libraries speak of lacquering 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.140
 because you can also this simply 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.780
 So I have to do so, so to speak 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.869
 homemade so I invite them from 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.490
 I would love to have color and there 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:13.260
 These ships under was also in the 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:15.000
 but probably I think this is red 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.860
 Fits better without the hips with the 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.930
 Ship on the wharf from both actually 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.610
 pretty blatant so look anyway 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.530
 we are in first time exactly at the front here 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.939
 that's really nice, of course 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.890
 toni logo is so beautiful is called mothers 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.640
 Of course, the lights were the verdict 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.680
 out 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.450
 earlier so in the beginning orga thought 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.250
 215 he looks like shit then has to look 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.550
 broken and now 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:44.820
 even if not here then there is 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:48.990
 500 adapters you probably stay on the 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:52.740
 I hope that was a high at the 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:56.490
 Those are good ski too short a time here 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.960
 Wheels are also well made and in here 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.840
 we have a pretty good one in there 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:04.080
 detail the cockpit in the cockpit always 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.090
 so kraska in the cockpit so here everything 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.740
 made pretty super is clear it is 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.149
 not ultra high resolution right now though 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.720
 You can read everything and that is gone 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.130
 yes , too 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.209
 be something that bothers me a bit 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.580
 is that this is a bit angular 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.680
 but otherwise, none of this works 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.440
 pedals know how important are actually 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.790
 eh not what but pretty chic 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.780
 made and also the model that is one 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:27.360
 mix of forza motorsport 4 and or 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:32.820
 failure before contradicts spokesman 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:35.730
 from before that saw speak and indie 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:38.400
 We have never had festivals here 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.260
 I was the totally cool from due 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.150
 because here then must as a license plate and 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.590
 the trunk with the just in always 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:49.950
 Parking becomes smaller because it is here 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:51.060
 that goes there nevertheless mark and there 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:56.640
 behind the back seat farewell lecture 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:03:00.810
 show the three sit here again 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:03.360
 nice cup holder da screen 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.730
 console radio further coupler attitude 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.430
 then again in the steering wheel with logo and 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.470
 By the way, the whole speedometer is full 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.060
 blatant gets him before 2015 the ford 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.840
 Mustang I do not know if with stars 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:18.530
 without having to go wrong in the us 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.989
 industry it leads into converts 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.040
 19,000 euros it is a mega cheap that 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.739
 was needed for kassel 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.470
 The standard at 15 had and it stood 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:31.109
 for his new for 19,000 euros that is 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.810
 a mega the price so and jan kielstein 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:35.250
 nice in the pattern no, so again 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.879
 I can talk to you sooner 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:45.660
 this line before that 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:47.060
 so here light and since I'd best 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.230
 say 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.510
 So you see the accelerated 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.340
 I quickly had good acceleration 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.050
 and top speed too and what 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:59.370
 with the super it's really the cellphone 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:00.140
 steered are ready so kraska left 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.580
 and drive right 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.720
 someday swords out but that 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.610
 is just gta 4 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.140
 but he has such a cool 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.660
 curve behavior and he drives so 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.489
 Precise is around so that's what I think 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.930
 the carriage in gta 4 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:14.670
 which is my best so far 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.500
 driving behavior has so that's real 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.700
 great and the war is also a good one 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.829
 you already know rating i say 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:24.389
 At the end I always do reviews 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:26.220
 in the mods can really quite paragraph 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.810
 is a correctness is a supermodel 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.940
 Today I got away from the board for the first time 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.580
 12 hours ago 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:35.370
 but there we make the crash with 230 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:39.870
 km / h a bit diagonal to the night 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:41.190
 the deformation is gm gta4 man 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.729
 should not go further than that 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.090
 wheels 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:48.830
 So okay, I would say it is 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.830
 however, it is just theater 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:53.860
 you can not do that much now either 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.860
 do 

00:04:57.529 --> 00:05:00.740
 the take it gives over the service there 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:02.270
 not anymore and still you have to 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:07.759
 still use it to allude to that 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:09.550
 shows 0 of course see super g j on 15 

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:13.699
 oh god shit 15 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:18.499
 so very nice the rollover of the 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:20.449
 is not noticed until the weekend 

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:23.059
 the four-year personality goes to whom 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:24.499
 the 50 cars in the air can control that 

00:05:23.059 --> 00:05:25.969
 not noticed when I saw gta 5 

00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:26.710
 that was shit that you control the 

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:30.289
 can 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:32.659
 window comes up years was the 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:33.979
 of course, about the 6 times short 

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:35.629
 the keyboard where we are already 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:39.199
 because promise a bit now even 

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:43.879
 the gas is scarce yes we are not at gta 4 

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:48.439
 kaspitz turn out to be tough with 280 against 

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:50.599
 Dragon is the sportsman understandable 

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:53.409
 igloo amounts the two quasi get 

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:53.409
 the motto 

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:12.210
 as he crawls away and then again 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:13.410
 Well, that is, dissolve it well on everyone 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:15.900
 beautiful defamation 

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:21.060
 So you just go already for 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:23.310
 rating so I would because of the dare 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:26.600
 its so what you clearly improve 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:29.310
 it is just out of your head 

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:31.200
 I still had to have a consultant 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:34.380
 I always had something to improve 

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:36.560
 actually could not do much 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:39.260
 say your damage model a bit 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:42.510
 you can improve one damage model 

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:44.460
 and so by the way I have in the 

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:46.350
 clarification no good thread found so 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:48.030
 that has remained so no credit 

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:50.880
 can you say what you like so much 

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:53.400
 Anyway to make it easier to rating 

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:55.530
 I give the place a nine out of ten 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.720
 possible points and that's damned 

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:59.730
 good and shining on monday 

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.410
 You can also present featured chevy terror 

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:02.250
 on the channel send the video 

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:05.460
 maybe it is also right in the 

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:07.680
 Display indicated that was already correct 

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:10.650
 good is in parentheses only in 

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:11.670
 quotes only seven out of ten 

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:13.760
 get points you should get 

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:16.380
 maybe thinking because you yourself 

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:17.880
 In any case very great motto is 

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:20.340
 even very good place I like right 

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:22.350
 well it turns out to be really nice 

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:24.990
 horny dare so everything the heart 

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:26.670
 In any case, if you want 

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:28.020
 also a bit interested 

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:30.150
 a pattern or just a few 

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:32.310
 cars for gta 4 hamburg gets him 

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:34.440
 Only great downlink is of course behind 

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:37.020
 in the video description so how 

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:39.030
 said clear recommendation 19 had angela 

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:39.500
 You do not have to dare and you do not have to 

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:43.770
 say 

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:45.510
 like I said so if you are down there 

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:47.310
 is the decision left in the 

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:48.720
 description and I would be happy 

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:50.190
 if you have a thumbs up or 

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.910
 maybe a share or or or 

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:55.920
 or 

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:59.280
 Maybe a little bit over it 

00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:00.870
 catapulted through the gap or 

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.860
 maybe even a poor or last that 

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:03.270
 we often because I do not like you 

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:05.220
 Of course, as his duty I thank you 

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:06.350
 me often grands crus to the 

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:09.350
 next time 

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:09.350
 si 

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:13.540
 there
