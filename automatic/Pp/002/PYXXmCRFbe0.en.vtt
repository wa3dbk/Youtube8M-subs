00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:12.630
 this new subaru xv diesel has at 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.910
 No entry into the new environmental zones 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.619
 problem because he owns a green 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.810
 This is a badge for other cars 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:23.970
 a bit more difficult but there is one 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:25.859
 solution the new environmental zones are there and 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.380
 many a car driver comes to one 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.480
 Retrofitting your diesel car with one 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.680
 particulate filter can not help but because 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.780
 otherwise there is an end in this almost 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.600
 fully automated production line 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.270
 Become a particle filter for cars but also 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.730
 for truck buses and even marine engines 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.020
 Made the company busy 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.300
 around 500 employees 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:53.309
 Managing Director Philipp Schulte explains 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:57.329
 us the production process step 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:00.000
 our production for particle filters 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.309
 We use our own development 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.899
 a sintered metal becomes the sintered metal 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.430
 here at our production plant in 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.409
 a first step on the 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.520
 appropriate size tailored and 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.680
 we form in a second step 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.000
 the corresponding bags from the goes in 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.560
 we see that in a totality 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.650
 next steps to an entire 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.390
 or diesel particulate filters together after 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.180
 some other production steps 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.189
 we can make a finished bag here 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.560
 present the weasel exhaust flowing 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.600
 from here through the bag and 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.310
 must through the the intermezzo through the 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.470
 flow through the actual filter medium 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.869
 for that for this cleaning effect the 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.520
 Title exhaust show the filter bag like 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.540
 it here 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.010
 production process circular 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.600
 arranged by our own 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.400
 But we are also in the process of development 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.110
 not only circular one round 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.150
 form but also so-called 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.070
 bags filters and many applications 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.190
 Equip with diesel particulate filter too 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.190
 can 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.700
 So after welding process looks like this 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.100
 our finished filter on before it 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.970
 of course we will see here 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.990
 52 filter bags leading to a round trip 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.310
 were arranged and after the 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.989
 final control as I said is the 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.209
 sheathed and he gives the finished one 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.250
 Product after welding the customer 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.569
 finds only a threat city â€‹â€‹and 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.610
 basically it goes straight to the 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:27.060
 Shipping for retrofitting of a car in 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:29.370
 Market cars are certainly one 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.810
 cause of soot particles almost 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.459
 but have unrestricted 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.950
 railway traffic vehicles of the public 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.299
 inland shipping and also 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.940
 Construction machinery with one 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:40.049
 exception permission zones access without 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.840
 partikelfilter 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:44.280
 although every single vehicle partially 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.640
 up to 1000 times more soot particles 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.140
 ejects as a single car in 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.870
 For example, there are other countries 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.390
 Already today a regulation for 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.950
 Stationary engines or construction machines 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.569
 We also meet in every city and 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.280
 We hope that Germany here too 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.750
 a sign sets and with a good one 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.010
 For example, this is also possible 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.510
 These engines are forested with one 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.820
 Particle filter must be operated 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.680
 The retrofit is very easy and simple 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.540
 in most cases in one hour 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.579
 done by a workshop 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.010
 actual particle filter gets behind 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:16.680
 placed in the standard catalytic converter 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:20.450
 original parts are removed and 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.450
 replaced by model-specific new parts 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.350
 but all cars can be converted 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.380
 what you have to pay attention to 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.060
 and the expert ludger mons 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.490
 In principle, every vehicle can 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.840
 diesel engine with an article reduction 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.030
 be equipped 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.740
 The catalyst should not get older 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.480
 Being five years old and the vehicle 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:47.690
 should not be more than 80,000 kilometers 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.190
 2013 are still in the 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.620
 enjoyment of state support 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:54.140
 would like to hurry because one 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.270
 Retrofitting will be rewarded with 260 euros and 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.880
 the state promotional pot of 30 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:00.680
 millions of euros are enough for about 90,000 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.890
 Vehicles purely statistically 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.150
 but it could be considerably more 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.110
 do the conversion after the 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.280
 promotion still sense 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:08.990
 of course, makes it into the 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.730
 Vehicles also later with 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:12.260
 equip another particle filter 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.580
 you have to take into account that many 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.190
 environmental zones only with green plaque 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.570
 to be driven and on sale of the 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.100
 vehicle is of course also clear that 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.020
 the value is correspondingly higher and 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.580
 not at all negligible 

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:25.090
 of course the environmental aspect and does that 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.090
 environment something good 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.430
 retrofit particulate filters and 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.320
 offered to different manufacturers 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.250
 the cheapest ones are not always 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.870
 the best choice 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.000
 I would always recommend one 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.220
 just choose branded product because it 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.910
 is durable and durable too 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.330
 we act as if we have questions 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.830
 monitoring organizations like to 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.840
 disposal we have corresponding 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.670
 Databases where we can look 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.390
 which manufacturer offers which 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:57.190
 product for the respective vehicle 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:59.560
 since january are in many environmental zones 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.900
 only green plaques allowed 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.700
 who in this zone without appropriate 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.920
 plakette enters at one 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:08.620
 control of a fine of 40 euros 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.950
 and a point in flensburg not more 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.950
 past
