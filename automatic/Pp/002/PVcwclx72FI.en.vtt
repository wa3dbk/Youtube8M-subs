00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:04.140
 hello techno fans how are they jose 

00:00:02.459 --> 00:00:06.360
 techno fanatic dotcom and today they 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.059
 I have the unpacking and analysis of 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.919
 this light very interesting as it is 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.959
 difference from the majority that you are going 

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:15.389
 I find in the market because 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:17.190
 It has a very thin tip for 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.670
 better details when using 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:24.260
 the company is mobile jazz and the product 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.260
 it's called digital lupe 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:37.010
 ready for unpacking 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.579
 Hello 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.909
 quote the TV 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:47.699
 and here in our product this was 

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:50.890
 He launched recently appeared in the film 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:54.010
 2014 and other fairs more and how they 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.780
 commented how interesting is that the tip 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:01:00.600
 it's much thinner than it 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.600
 we usually see in these spaces 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:06.989
 remove it in the box and you can 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.989
 see put the presentation 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:11.180
 another knife more 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.830
 and here we have it includes the battery 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.830
 triple A 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:35.700
 come on we have a card 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.700
 plus a user- to-user guide 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:42.160
 and what we're going to do now is install 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.800
 the battery will give you a little manual and 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.890
 show you the functionality of 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.500
 this style I use the installation of the 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.270
 battery is think if the only one has to 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.690
 do is place it in the back 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:59.410
 then twist moss and that would be all 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:02.050
 let's meet here with a light 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:04.300
 green here you have holes that 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.230
 when you activate the pen we will 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.990
 move it 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:10.899
 the light is going to learn this after seeing 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:14.350
 and that means it's activated later 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.750
 to be able to pay it, we simply move 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.300
 the top and that would be all 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.670
 you are going to have it off now 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.050
 I want to give you the specifications of the 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.120
 lupe in digital and then we're going to 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.720
 show it to you in operation 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.760
 together with the ipad and the galaxy s 5 the 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.650
 digital art is special for cell phones 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.510
 and tablets uses an amplified circuit 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.640
 of loading for greater accuracy at 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.720
 time to draw and take notes not 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.940
 requires bluetooth to 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.380
 or use it works with most 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.900
 applications that is does not require a 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.060
 application that is to use the tip 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.190
 it's 1.8 millimeters it works with the 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.290
 most capacitive screens 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.210
 requires a triple battery 'a' and account 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.770
 with a rest mode after three 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.080
 minutes does not mean that if you 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.610
 they forgot to turn off the barn 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.940
 automatically since three minutes is 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.920
 will shut down the cost of $ 49 with 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.810
 95 and you can get it for 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.670
 middle of the jazz mobile.com website 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.020
 below this video from the area 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.520
 description let's leave the link to 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.930
 that you can go to the 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.989
 product page 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.120
 here we find the typical style 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:20.540
 you can find the pretty one in the 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.129
 top and here we have the loop in 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.620
 digital you can see the great 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:26.480
 difference from thickness here 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.209
 practically is how to use a pencil 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.620
 or pencil, let's try it in one of 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:34.400
 these applications that I just 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:36.920
 download we will place here a new 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.840
 and we are going to teach you for example 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.280
 I'm not very good at drawing with this is 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.680
 has been able to see 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.890
 and we are going to images that are doing 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:48.550
 you a location box where 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.550
 Your address is located 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:57.180
 it's ok here is my half house 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.180
 block from your house but big 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:04.190
 my house 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:06.230
 and you can see what it feels like 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.519
 much more accurate especially when 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.349
 you are drawing and that is what 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:12.080
 let's demonstrate below 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:13.940
 then it's not as much as the typical 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.980
 styles that at the moment that you are 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.690
 drawing, they will not be able to visualize 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.970
 well where are they pointing by the 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.610
 fact that in the future short of for 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:26.000
 medium then here we are going to take them to 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:29.370
 another application that is to be here 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.280
 call art set and what we're going to do is 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.780
 add a new one and show them to you 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.210
 as for example let's make a 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.630
 circle let's change let's put 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.630
 crayon 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:42.840
 let's make a circle and at the moment 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.760
 that we started to detail to 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:48.510
 paint we will have the advantage of being able to 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:50.280
 see and not get out of the margin of going to 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:52.020
 be much easier for us to be able to 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:55.230
 draw these be accurate to 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:59.160
 those that use applications of 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:01.950
 drawing with it to the digital open they go to 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:05.490
 have more precision let's change it 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:07.639
 for example with this rose 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:10.099
 you can see 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:12.319
 that are not going to leave the margins and 

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:15.199
 they will be able to work in a much 

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:16.969
 more precise then this would come to be 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:18.949
 aluminum now what we are going to do 

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:20.960
 is to use it also in our 

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:25.370
 mobile device here I have the salt 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:29.120
 They are 10 to 5 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:32.120
 and we will be able to use it in the lupe 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.560
 also to be able to browse our 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.940
 cellular we will be able to lower the 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.390
 notifications we will be able to also 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:38.850
 use 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:41.070
 double screen here and I have a 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:44.810
 application that is called hand wright and 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.810
 for example let's write here 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:47.800
 Hello 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.850
 everyone 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.560
 then as you can see they are not going 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:58.400
 to have problems also at the time of 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.000
 write and be able to surf on your cell phone or 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.660
 Tablet 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:06.770
 we go for example to techno fans 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:08.120
 explain here and we will navigate without any 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.330
 problem we will be able to do double 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.330
 click 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.490
 make a new article here 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:21.980
 there it is then it is useful above all 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:23.390
 for those who use the style 

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:26.000
 to be able to draw because they are going to have 

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:28.130
 greater accuracy if you are interested in 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.740
