00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
we're really talking about what chance

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.130 
we're really talking about what chance
is<00:00:47.160> there<00:00:47.340> that<00:00:47.399> these<00:00:47.760> four<00:00:48.300> cards<00:00:48.629> are

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
is there that these four cards are

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.840 
is there that these four cards are
somehow<00:00:49.350> coming<00:00:49.890> together<00:00:50.070> with<00:00:50.460> either<00:00:50.610> your

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
somehow coming together with either your

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.819 
somehow coming together with either your
whole<00:00:51.090> cards<00:00:51.449> or<00:00:51.600> my<00:00:51.809> whole<00:00:52.050> cards<00:00:52.350> or<00:00:52.590> perhaps

whole cards or my whole cards or perhaps

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.830 
whole cards or my whole cards or perhaps
with<00:00:53.190> themselves<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:54.030> make<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.210> much<00:00:54.449> stronger

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
with themselves to make a much stronger

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.229 
with themselves to make a much stronger
hand<00:00:55.170> in<00:00:55.410> this<00:00:55.860> case<00:00:56.100> we<00:00:56.309> have<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.550> two<00:00:56.820> three

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
hand in this case we have a two three

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.360 
hand in this case we have a two three
and<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.449> four<00:00:57.690> so<00:00:58.320> if<00:00:58.440> somebody<00:00:58.800> was<00:00:58.949> holding<00:00:59.129> an

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
and a four so if somebody was holding an

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.490 
and a four so if somebody was holding an
ace<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.879> a<00:01:00.420> five<00:01:00.690> he'd<00:01:00.989> already<00:01:01.289> have<00:01:01.469> a

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
ace and a five he'd already have a

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.349 
ace and a five he'd already have a
straight<00:01:01.890> or<00:01:02.129> if<00:01:02.609> he<00:01:02.730> was<00:01:02.820> holding<00:01:03.000> two

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
straight or if he was holding two

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.090 
straight or if he was holding two
diamonds<00:01:03.809> he'd<00:01:04.019> only<00:01:04.170> need<00:01:04.350> one<00:01:04.650> more<00:01:04.860> diamond

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
diamonds he'd only need one more diamond

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.520 
diamonds he'd only need one more diamond
to<00:01:05.430> make<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.580> flush<00:01:05.880> exactly<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:06.900> lot<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.320> times

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
to make a flush exactly a lot of times

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.380 
to make a flush exactly a lot of times
you're<00:01:07.770> trying<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.130> figure<00:01:08.430> out<00:01:08.460> not<00:01:08.970> so<00:01:09.180> much

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
you're trying to figure out not so much

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.910 
you're trying to figure out not so much
what<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:09.600> have<00:01:09.869> in<00:01:09.990> your<00:01:10.110> hand<00:01:10.350> cuz<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.680> know

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
what you have in your hand cuz you know

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.700 
what you have in your hand cuz you know
but<00:01:11.280> you're<00:01:11.460> trying<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:12.030> decide<00:01:12.600> what<00:01:13.409> your

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
but you're trying to decide what your

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.649 
but you're trying to decide what your
opponent<00:01:14.250> would<00:01:14.369> have<00:01:14.490> called<00:01:14.850> or<00:01:15.299> raised

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
opponent would have called or raised

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.310 
opponent would have called or raised
with<00:01:16.070> originally<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:17.700> this<00:01:17.909> is<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.119> flop<00:01:19.049> that

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
with originally so this is a flop that

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.249 
with originally so this is a flop that
normally<00:01:20.189> wouldn't<00:01:21.090> help<00:01:21.540> an<00:01:21.720> original

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
normally wouldn't help an original

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.710 
normally wouldn't help an original
better<00:01:22.500> unless<00:01:22.860> he<00:01:23.070> has<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.310> high<00:01:23.640> pair<00:01:24.030> or

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
better unless he has a high pair or

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.320 
better unless he has a high pair or
maybe<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.380> Ace<00:01:25.530> King<00:01:25.890> of<00:01:26.070> Diamonds<00:01:26.280> ace<00:01:26.729> nine

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
maybe the Ace King of Diamonds ace nine

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.179 
maybe the Ace King of Diamonds ace nine
of<00:01:27.570> diamonds<00:01:27.780> somewhere<00:01:28.320> he<00:01:28.380> has<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.500> big<00:01:28.860> draw

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
of diamonds somewhere he has a big draw

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.679 
of diamonds somewhere he has a big draw
so<00:01:29.700> in<00:01:29.790> this<00:01:29.850> case<00:01:30.090> you<00:01:30.299> don't<00:01:30.450> know<00:01:30.509> what<00:01:30.630> I

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
so in this case you don't know what I

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.030 
so in this case you don't know what I
have<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.290> don't<00:01:31.350> know<00:01:31.560> what<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:31.829> have

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
although I do know that you raised so

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.840 
although I do know that you raised so
you<00:01:34.200> liked<00:01:34.560> your<00:01:34.799> hand<00:01:35.009> before<00:01:35.369> we<00:01:35.490> saw<00:01:35.640> any

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
much of a hand but but in this case I

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.290 
much of a hand but but in this case I

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
you're at and I'm assuming that you

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.300 
you're at and I'm assuming that you
would<00:02:11.849> lead<00:02:12.090> out<00:02:12.330> here<00:02:12.660> at<00:02:12.810> me<00:02:12.959> then

would lead out here at me then

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.479 
would lead out here at me then
mind<00:02:13.610> if<00:02:13.880> you<00:02:13.970> didn't<00:02:14.420> I<00:02:14.569> would<00:02:14.840> be<00:02:15.200> I<00:02:15.500> would<00:02:16.220> be

mind if you didn't I would be I would be

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.699 
mind if you didn't I would be I would be
surprised<00:02:17.060> okay<00:02:17.660> so<00:02:17.989> it's<00:02:18.230> important<00:02:18.530> to<00:02:18.590> note

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
surprised okay so it's important to note

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.470 
surprised okay so it's important to note
that<00:02:18.739> you<00:02:19.069> would<00:02:19.220> have<00:02:19.400> to<00:02:19.520> act<00:02:19.700> first<00:02:19.970> because

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
that you would have to act first because

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.059 
that you would have to act first because
you're<00:02:20.690> the<00:02:20.840> player<00:02:21.140> immediately<00:02:21.830> to<00:02:21.950> the

left of the dealer button which just
represents<00:02:25.099> whoever's<00:02:25.459> dealing<00:02:25.640> now<00:02:25.910> because

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150

dealing the cars since he's no longer in
the<00:02:34.849> hand<00:02:35.150> you're<00:02:35.630> the<00:02:35.780> first<00:02:36.019> player<00:02:36.230> with

if you want to take me off the hand or

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:13.089 
if you want to take me off the hand or
if<00:03:11.450> you<00:03:11.599> want<00:03:11.810> to<00:03:11.900> check<00:03:12.110> you're<00:03:12.650> not<00:03:12.830> sure

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:13.099 
if you want to check you're not sure

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:16.089 
if you want to check you're not sure
what<00:03:13.280> I<00:03:13.310> have<00:03:13.610> right<00:03:13.970> so<00:03:14.360> in<00:03:14.780> the<00:03:15.380> preflop

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:16.099 
what I have right so in the preflop

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:17.830 
what I have right so in the preflop
betting<00:03:16.549> we<00:03:16.760> know<00:03:16.910> that<00:03:17.150> you<00:03:17.299> raised<00:03:17.600> and<00:03:17.750> I

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
betting we know that you raised and I

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.630 
betting we know that you raised and I
simply<00:03:18.260> called<00:03:18.530> but<00:03:18.769> at<00:03:18.859> that<00:03:18.980> point<00:03:19.160> I<00:03:19.370> stated

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
simply called but at that point I stated

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.250 
simply called but at that point I stated
that<00:03:19.760> I<00:03:19.910> really<00:03:20.180> felt<00:03:20.420> I<00:03:20.570> had<00:03:20.720> the<00:03:20.840> strongest

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
that I really felt I had the strongest

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.949 
that I really felt I had the strongest
hand<00:03:21.560> now<00:03:22.130> I<00:03:22.459> seem<00:03:23.090> to<00:03:23.180> think<00:03:23.510> that<00:03:23.600> the<00:03:23.750> board

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
hand now I seem to think that the board

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:25.630 
hand now I seem to think that the board
hasn't<00:03:24.200> helped<00:03:24.560> you<00:03:24.650> or<00:03:24.859> improved<00:03:25.220> your<00:03:25.370> hand

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
hasn't helped you or improved your hand

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.190 
hasn't helped you or improved your hand
because<00:03:25.970> you've<00:03:26.120> checked<00:03:26.359> twice<00:03:26.690> to<00:03:26.930> me<00:03:27.049> now

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
because you've checked twice to me now

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.250 
because you've checked twice to me now
and<00:03:27.880> ordinarily<00:03:28.880> I<00:03:29.060> would<00:03:29.420> say<00:03:29.600> well<00:03:29.870> since<00:03:30.109> I

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
and ordinarily I would say well since I

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.460 
and ordinarily I would say well since I
thought<00:03:30.500> I<00:03:30.530> had<00:03:30.799> the<00:03:30.950> best<00:03:31.190> hand<00:03:31.310> going<00:03:31.640> in<00:03:32.000> and

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
thought I had the best hand going in and

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.009 
thought I had the best hand going in and
you<00:03:33.470> haven't<00:03:33.829> bet<00:03:34.100> twice<00:03:34.670> I<00:03:35.060> think<00:03:35.690> I<00:03:35.780> still

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
you haven't bet twice I think I still

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:36.819 
you haven't bet twice I think I still
have<00:03:36.049> the<00:03:36.200> best<00:03:36.470> hand

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
have the best hand

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:39.550 
have the best hand
so<00:03:37.130> I<00:03:37.160> most<00:03:37.819> likely<00:03:38.060> would<00:03:38.690> bet<00:03:38.900> the<00:03:38.930> hand<00:03:39.290> here

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
so I most likely would bet the hand here

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.140 
so I most likely would bet the hand here
I'm<00:03:39.890> gonna<00:03:40.160> bet<00:03:40.340> a<00:03:40.370> very<00:03:40.640> small<00:03:41.000> amount

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
I'm gonna bet a very small amount

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.240 
I'm gonna bet a very small amount
because<00:03:41.540> I<00:03:41.720> think<00:03:42.049> I<00:03:42.170> have<00:03:42.410> the<00:03:42.590> best<00:03:42.799> hand<00:03:43.069> and

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
because I think I have the best hand and

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:44.559 
because I think I have the best hand and
I<00:03:43.310> don't<00:03:43.370> think<00:03:43.549> you're<00:03:43.819> likely<00:03:44.060> to<00:03:44.239> improve

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:44.569 
I don't think you're likely to improve

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:46.420 
I don't think you're likely to improve
and<00:03:44.930> I<00:03:45.139> want<00:03:45.380> you<00:03:45.500> to<00:03:45.530> call<00:03:45.829> here<00:03:46.100> so<00:03:46.280> that

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
and I want you to call here so that

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:47.770 
and I want you to call here so that
you'll<00:03:46.519> put<00:03:46.670> more<00:03:46.940> money<00:03:47.150> in<00:03:47.269> the<00:03:47.329> pot<00:03:47.540> and<00:03:47.720> I

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
you'll put more money in the pot and I

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.449 
you'll put more money in the pot and I
can<00:03:47.930> win<00:03:48.049> a<00:03:48.079> bigger<00:03:48.319> pot<00:03:48.560> in<00:03:48.680> the<00:03:48.769> end<00:03:48.920> so<00:03:49.250> in

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
can win a bigger pot in the end so in

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:51.490 
can win a bigger pot in the end so in
this<00:03:49.579> case<00:03:49.819> I've<00:03:50.060> bet<00:03:50.389> four<00:03:50.810> chips<00:03:51.139> because<00:03:51.350> I

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
this case I've bet four chips because I

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.949 
this case I've bet four chips because I
think<00:03:51.620> I<00:03:51.920> have<00:03:52.130> the<00:03:52.280> best<00:03:52.489> hand<00:03:52.790> and<00:03:53.030> frankly<00:03:53.930> I

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
think I have the best hand and frankly I

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:55.449 
think I have the best hand and frankly I
want<00:03:54.260> Rhett<00:03:54.410> to<00:03:54.560> call<00:03:54.739> and<00:03:54.889> put<00:03:55.010> more<00:03:55.160> money<00:03:55.340> in

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
want Rhett to call and put more money in

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.640 
want Rhett to call and put more money in
the<00:03:55.519> pot<00:03:55.700> because<00:03:55.940> I<00:03:56.030> think<00:03:56.269> I'm<00:03:56.389> winning<00:03:56.650> now

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
the pot because I think I'm winning now

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.920 
the pot because I think I'm winning now
in<00:03:57.769> this<00:03:57.889> situation<00:03:58.190> this<00:03:58.760> is<00:03:58.819> a<00:03:59.000> hard<00:03:59.329> play<00:03:59.660> I

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
in this situation this is a hard play I

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.860 
in this situation this is a hard play I
don't<00:03:59.989> have<00:04:00.470> a<00:04:00.500> great<00:04:00.980> hand<00:04:01.340> I<00:04:01.690> don't<00:04:02.690> have<00:04:02.840> a

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
don't have a great hand I don't have a

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.900 
don't have a great hand I don't have a
terrible<00:04:03.260> and<00:04:03.410> I<00:04:03.470> have<00:04:03.560> over<00:04:03.889> cards<00:04:04.310> and<00:04:04.549> I

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
terrible and I have over cards and I

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.670 
terrible and I have over cards and I
think<00:04:05.209> Rick's<00:04:05.510> making<00:04:05.720> a<00:04:05.989> play<00:04:06.200> why<00:04:06.410> would<00:04:06.590> he

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
think Rick's making a play why would he

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.920 
think Rick's making a play why would he
bet<00:04:06.859> such<00:04:07.100> a<00:04:07.130> small<00:04:07.519> amount<00:04:07.639> so<00:04:08.389> I<00:04:08.420> would<00:04:08.690> call

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
bet such a small amount so I would call

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.140 
bet such a small amount so I would call
the<00:04:09.170> four<00:04:09.410> chips<00:04:09.799> in<00:04:10.010> this<00:04:10.130> spot<00:04:10.370> just<00:04:10.730> to<00:04:10.850> see

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
the four chips in this spot just to see

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.050 
the four chips in this spot just to see
a<00:04:11.420> either<00:04:12.380> to<00:04:12.709> make<00:04:12.859> a<00:04:12.889> bluff<00:04:13.250> at<00:04:13.430> the<00:04:13.519> river<00:04:13.730> or

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
a either to make a bluff at the river or

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.150 
a either to make a bluff at the river or
maybe<00:04:14.329> hit<00:04:14.630> the<00:04:14.660> one<00:04:15.109> of<00:04:15.230> my<00:04:15.350> better<00:04:15.560> and<00:04:15.799> over

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
maybe hit the one of my better and over

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.920 
maybe hit the one of my better and over
cards<00:04:16.579> and<00:04:16.789> try<00:04:16.970> to<00:04:17.030> win<00:04:17.269> the<00:04:17.389> pot<00:04:17.600> so

basically<00:04:18.260> right<00:04:18.560> either<00:04:18.799> you<00:04:19.039> don't<00:04:19.190> believe

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
basically right either you don't believe

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.339 
basically right either you don't believe
me<00:04:19.729> or<00:04:19.940> you<00:04:20.120> think<00:04:20.269> I<00:04:20.419> might<00:04:20.600> have<00:04:20.750> a<00:04:20.810> marginal

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:21.349 
me or you think I might have a marginal

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:22.360 
me or you think I might have a marginal
hand<00:04:21.560> and<00:04:21.709> you<00:04:21.769> think<00:04:21.950> you<00:04:22.039> might<00:04:22.070> have<00:04:22.310> a

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
hand and you think you might have a

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.219 
hand and you think you might have a
chance<00:04:22.610> of<00:04:22.789> catching<00:04:23.030> up<00:04:23.300> on<00:04:23.479> the<00:04:23.570> river<00:04:23.780> or<00:04:24.200> I

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:24.229 
chance of catching up on the river or I

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:25.960 
chance of catching up on the river or I
might<00:04:24.590> be<00:04:24.740> able<00:04:24.860> to<00:04:24.950> bet<00:04:25.190> enough<00:04:25.460> to<00:04:25.610> take<00:04:25.820> you

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
might be able to bet enough to take you

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:26.830 
might be able to bet enough to take you
off<00:04:26.120> your<00:04:26.150> hand

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
off your hand

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.270 
off your hand
be<00:04:26.960> setting<00:04:27.230> me<00:04:27.320> up<00:04:27.350> for<00:04:27.590> the<00:04:27.650> bluff<00:04:27.860> so<00:04:28.100> that's

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
be setting me up for the bluff so that's

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.220 
be setting me up for the bluff so that's
why<00:04:28.430> you're<00:04:28.639> a<00:04:28.669> pro<00:04:29.000> okay<00:04:29.600> so<00:04:29.660> we've<00:04:29.930> seen<00:04:30.139> the
