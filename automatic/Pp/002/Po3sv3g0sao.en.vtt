think dynast is sort of perfect for the
King<00:01:33.570> George<00:01:33.869> is<00:01:34.110> that<00:01:34.470> he's<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.619> bit<00:01:34.979> like<00:01:35.220> Ron

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
King George is that he's a bit like Ron

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.580

Kruger actually sort of falls between

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.109 
Kruger actually sort of falls between
two<00:01:37.950> silver<00:01:38.280> don't<00:01:38.430> think<00:01:38.549> he'll<00:01:38.640> stay<00:01:38.909> ever

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
two silver don't think he'll stay ever

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.330 
two silver don't think he'll stay ever
ever<00:01:39.750> stay<00:01:40.079> well<00:01:40.290> enough<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.650> win<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.799> Gold<00:01:41.100> Cup

ever stay well enough to win a Gold Cup

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.670 
ever stay well enough to win a Gold Cup
he<00:01:42.180> came<00:01:42.420> there<00:01:42.570> looking<00:01:42.840> like<00:01:42.869> he<00:01:43.170> had<00:01:43.649> a

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
he came there looking like he had a

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.260 
he came there looking like he had a
chance<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.280> sort<00:01:44.460> of<00:01:44.490> weakened<00:01:44.880> after<00:01:45.000> the

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
chance and sort of weakened after the

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.899 
chance and sort of weakened after the
last<00:01:45.420> at<00:01:45.689> Haydock<00:01:46.049> on<00:01:46.200> Saturday<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:47.009> don't

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
last at Haydock on Saturday I don't

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.389 
last at Haydock on Saturday I don't
think<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:49.140> gold<00:01:49.380> couple<00:01:49.740> be<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.890> race<00:01:50.100> that<00:01:50.280> he

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
think the gold couple be a race that he

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.219 
think the gold couple be a race that he
can<00:01:50.610> win<00:01:50.850> simply<00:01:51.540> due<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.750> his<00:01:52.020> lack<00:01:52.049> of

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
can win simply due to his lack of

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.580 
can win simply due to his lack of
stamina<00:01:52.799> I<00:01:53.780> think<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.869> King<00:01:55.020> George's<00:01:55.380> his

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
stamina I think the King George's his

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.959 
stamina I think the King George's his
race<00:01:57.259> silviano<00:01:58.259> Conte<00:01:58.829> I<00:01:59.100> mean<00:01:59.460> I've<00:01:59.820> never

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
race silviano Conte I mean I've never

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.280 
race silviano Conte I mean I've never
really<00:02:00.240> been<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.420> fan<00:02:00.479> it<00:02:00.780> is<00:02:00.869> I<00:02:00.990> think<00:02:01.049> you'll

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
really been a fan it is I think you'll

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.899 
really been a fan it is I think you'll
just<00:02:01.469> fall<00:02:01.649> a<00:02:01.710> little<00:02:01.920> bit<00:02:02.189> shorter<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.700> best

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
just fall a little bit shorter the best

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.289 
just fall a little bit shorter the best
so<00:02:03.380> so<00:02:04.380> I<00:02:04.409> wouldn't<00:02:04.710> be<00:02:05.159> too<00:02:05.850> interested<00:02:06.030> in

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
so so I wouldn't be too interested in

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.819 
so so I wouldn't be too interested in
him<00:02:06.509> fry<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.780> rice<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.320> to<00:02:07.590> be<00:02:07.680> perfectly

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
him fry the rice and to be perfectly

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.160 
him fry the rice and to be perfectly
honest<00:02:08.250> I<00:02:08.369> think<00:02:08.429> last<00:02:09.179> year's<00:02:09.450> gold<00:02:09.690> cup<00:02:09.899> form

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
honest I think last year's gold cup form

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.559 
honest I think last year's gold cup form
is<00:02:10.289> looking<00:02:10.640> shaky<00:02:11.640> er<00:02:11.879> by<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.120> minute<00:02:12.510> I

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
is looking shaky er by the minute I

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.530 
is looking shaky er by the minute I
don't<00:02:12.660> know<00:02:12.840> there<00:02:13.020> is<00:02:13.110> a<00:02:13.200> very

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
don't know there is a very

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.270 
don't know there is a very
hard<00:02:13.689> race<00:02:13.989> that<00:02:14.349> they<00:02:14.500> all<00:02:14.680> had<00:02:14.860> that<00:02:15.069> date

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
hard race that they all had that date

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.559 
hard race that they all had that date
with<00:02:15.459> it<00:02:15.549> rained<00:02:15.760> on<00:02:15.879> the<00:02:16.060> day<00:02:16.209> and<00:02:16.390> it<00:02:16.540> was

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
with it rained on the day and it was

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.449 
with it rained on the day and it was
looked<00:02:16.840> like<00:02:16.930> quite<00:02:17.290> a<00:02:17.319> brutal<00:02:17.739> race<00:02:17.950> but<00:02:18.250> none

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
looked like quite a brutal race but none

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.640 
looked like quite a brutal race but none
of<00:02:18.489> them<00:02:18.640> have<00:02:18.790> come<00:02:18.969> back<00:02:19.150> and<00:02:19.359> performed<00:02:19.930> out

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
of them have come back and performed out

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:21.959 
of them have come back and performed out
of<00:02:20.709> the<00:02:20.859> race<00:02:21.010> at<00:02:21.189> all<00:02:21.370> bobs<00:02:21.609> worth<00:02:21.790> was

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:21.969 
of the race at all bobs worth was

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:23.819 
of the race at all bobs worth was
terrible<00:02:22.359> care<00:02:22.629> tribulation<00:02:23.260> was<00:02:23.409> terrible

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:23.829 
terrible care tribulation was terrible

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:26.399 
terrible care tribulation was terrible
both<00:02:24.519> Silviniaco<00:02:24.969> Conti<00:02:25.000> ran<00:02:25.810> okay<00:02:25.930> but<00:02:26.170> then

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:26.409 
both Silviniaco Conti ran okay but then

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:27.899 
both Silviniaco Conti ran okay but then
he<00:02:26.469> didn't<00:02:26.739> have<00:02:26.859> to<00:02:26.890> run<00:02:27.340> up<00:02:27.489> the<00:02:27.609> hill<00:02:27.700> that

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:27.909 
he didn't have to run up the hill that

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:29.940 
he didn't have to run up the hill that
last<00:02:28.150> time<00:02:28.420> did<00:02:28.599> he<00:02:28.629> he<00:02:28.840> fell<00:02:29.079> fell<00:02:29.500> three<00:02:29.769> out

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
last time did he he fell fell three out

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.550 
last time did he he fell fell three out
so<00:02:30.849> maybe<00:02:30.970> he<00:02:31.180> was<00:02:31.299> kept<00:02:31.540> out<00:02:31.720> of<00:02:31.780> the<00:02:31.989> brutal

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
so maybe he was kept out of the brutal

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.069 
so maybe he was kept out of the brutal
bit<00:02:32.890> of<00:02:33.069> it<00:02:33.189> and<00:02:33.220> you<00:02:34.060> know<00:02:34.150> just<00:02:34.629> isn't

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:35.079 
bit of it and you know just isn't

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:37.920 
bit of it and you know just isn't
working<00:02:35.230> out<00:02:35.530> that<00:02:35.769> well<00:02:36.090> so<00:02:37.090> therefore<00:02:37.629> I'd

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
working out that well so therefore I'd

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.319 
working out that well so therefore I'd
be<00:02:38.140> slightly<00:02:38.769> concerned<00:02:39.340> about<00:02:39.609> you<00:02:40.180> know

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:40.329 
be slightly concerned about you know

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:41.759 
be slightly concerned about you know

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
those ones going back you know the bobs

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:43.679 
those ones going back you know the bobs

sort of race yeah I think I think he's

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.069 
sort of race yeah I think I think he's
probably<00:03:28.060> out<00:03:28.269> barking<00:03:28.750> up<00:03:28.840> the<00:03:28.870> right<00:03:29.019> tree

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
probably out barking up the right tree

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:31.050 
probably out barking up the right tree
there<00:03:29.500> see<00:03:30.340> him<00:03:30.489> being<00:03:30.639> overpriced

there see him being overpriced

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.390 
there see him being overpriced
definitely<00:03:31.629> after<00:03:32.590> winning<00:03:32.739> on<00:03:32.919> any<00:03:33.069> power

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
definitely after winning on any power

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.129 
definitely after winning on any power
Ruby<00:03:33.879> Walsh<00:03:34.060> said<00:03:34.299> she<00:03:34.479> could<00:03:34.659> go<00:03:34.840> for<00:03:35.049> the

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:35.139 
Ruby Walsh said she could go for the

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:36.629 
Ruby Walsh said she could go for the
champion<00:03:35.590> hurdle<00:03:35.739> is<00:03:36.040> that<00:03:36.190> the<00:03:36.280> right<00:03:36.400> race

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:36.639 
champion hurdle is that the right race

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:40.110 
champion hurdle is that the right race
to<00:03:36.879> target<00:03:37.269> I<00:03:38.199> think<00:03:38.949> probably<00:03:39.459> at<00:03:39.729> this<00:03:39.849> stage

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
to target I think probably at this stage

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.789 
to target I think probably at this stage
yeah<00:03:40.329> because<00:03:40.540> I<00:03:40.720> don't<00:03:41.079> want<00:03:41.440> to<00:03:41.590> run<00:03:41.709> our

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
yeah because I don't want to run our

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:43.770 
yeah because I don't want to run our
against<00:03:42.069> KU<00:03:42.250> Vega<00:03:42.669> in<00:03:42.909> the<00:03:43.150> in<00:03:43.419> the<00:03:43.479> mayor's

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
against KU Vega in the in the mayor's

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.189 
against KU Vega in the in the mayor's
hurdle<00:03:44.349> I<00:03:44.970> think<00:03:45.970> she's<00:03:46.449> only<00:03:46.629> a<00:03:46.720> young<00:03:46.900> horse

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:47.199 
hurdle I think she's only a young horse

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:49.559 
hurdle I think she's only a young horse
scopes<00:03:47.949> you<00:03:48.310> know<00:03:48.459> plenty<00:03:48.909> of<00:03:49.120> time<00:03:49.269> ahead<00:03:49.419> of

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:49.569 
scopes you know plenty of time ahead of

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:51.930 
scopes you know plenty of time ahead of
her<00:03:49.780> I'm<00:03:50.290> not<00:03:50.769> necessarily<00:03:51.370> think<00:03:51.669> she<00:03:51.760> needs

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
her I'm not necessarily think she needs

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.539 
her I'm not necessarily think she needs
to<00:03:52.090> step<00:03:52.299> up<00:03:52.449> to<00:03:52.690> three<00:03:52.900> miles<00:03:53.139> just<00:03:53.409> yet<00:03:53.650> I<00:03:53.979> can

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 
to step up to three miles just yet I can

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:55.979 
to step up to three miles just yet I can
come<00:03:54.729> later<00:03:54.879> in<00:03:55.090> our<00:03:55.180> career<00:03:55.449> of<00:03:55.540> this<00:03:55.690> sorry<00:03:55.930> I

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:58.020 
come later in our career of this sorry I
can't<00:03:56.169> see<00:03:56.409> why<00:03:56.530> can't<00:03:57.400> have<00:03:57.579> a<00:03:57.609> crack<00:03:57.819> of<00:03:57.970> the

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
can't see why can't have a crack of the

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.059 
can't see why can't have a crack of the
champion<00:03:58.389> hurdle<00:03:58.680> absolutely<00:03:59.680> not<00:03:59.799> she's

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:00.069 
champion hurdle absolutely not she's

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:02.429 
champion hurdle absolutely not she's
unbeaten<00:04:00.689> that's<00:04:01.689> really<00:04:01.930> good<00:04:02.109> i<00:04:02.169> think<00:04:02.379> she

00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:02.439 
unbeaten that's really good i think she

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:04.679 
unbeaten that's really good i think she
was<00:04:02.500> a<00:04:02.560> bit<00:04:02.680> rusty<00:04:02.829> on<00:04:03.040> festy<00:04:03.519> jump<00:04:04.329> as<00:04:04.449> well<00:04:04.569> as

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
she could but yeah no problem she's also

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.550 
she could but yeah no problem she's also
shown<00:04:07.479> out<00:04:07.689> that<00:04:07.900> she<00:04:08.049> can<00:04:08.169> travel<00:04:08.379> over
