00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:12.500
 [Music] 

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:14.900
 hello how are you this time 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.830
 I bring a couple of themes to customize 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.660
 its windows 7 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.610
 the first thing is to download the file in 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.119
 the description will leave you the limit of 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.119
 the discharge 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.640
 it's very easy to install it are two 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.680
 today rank files we give right click 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.260
 then extract here we do the same 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.880
 procedure with the two files to me 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.130
 I get this because I do not have 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.829
 decompressed so do not rely on 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.739
 you will not leave 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.960
 these files do not think almost anything like that 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.699
 which is something very fast and if once 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.710
 done this we proceed to the installation 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:49.140
 of the patch I do not do it because I already 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.879
 I have left it is very necessary to patch 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.859
 your system will not otherwise be able 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.619
 install the good themes and your system 

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:58.379
 of 64 bit they give double click where it says 

00:00:55.619 --> 00:01:00.750
 universal fears to be x 64 and if your 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.750
 32- bit systems arrive where it says 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.360
 universal of my fire x86 good once 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.950
 double click on the patch to 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.630
 corresponding your system will reboot 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.550
 once it has been restarted we can 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.550
 install the rest 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.550
 [Music] 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.740
 install the themes is very easy we look for 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.050
 the topic we want to install we open the 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.390
 folder and we copy all the content that 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.060
 we have inside once copied we go to 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.070
 local disk is then the windows folder 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.200
 then it turns out to be and finally the 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.230
 folder temps and once here inside 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.240
 we right click and paste to mini sale 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:38.170
 this because I already had the theme installed 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.170
 installed 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.299
 well we have the theme installed now 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.770
 what we have to do is click 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.080
 right on the desk 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.210
 then customize once here we look for 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.520
 the issue that we have installed and we give 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.860
 click, we hope it will install and 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.860
 ready we have it installed 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.360
 As you can see it's all very cool just 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.580
 we need to put the folders 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.890
 transparent for that you have to execute 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.690
 a program called online is very 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.940
 single we just go to the folder that 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.630
 we have extracted and double click where 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.630
 says press 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:31.400

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.860
