 Hello my dear friends and

 today's review and video tutorial we are with 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.790
 you will install new firmware 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.969
 kitkat 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.730
 this time I will be installing 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.270
 show in detail how it all happens 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.390
 will install via clockworkmod 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.000
 recovery 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:29.220
 so let's first look at the version 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.920
 android 4 1 and 2 as well as you see cyan mod well 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.190
 well let's start the installation so 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.739
 first reboot into recovery 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.149
 if you don't have a feature like me 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:44.010
 now turn on my smartphone 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:47.780
 restart then I advise you to look 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:51.180
 video on my channel how to enable 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:54.680
 recovery using these buttons 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.840
 how it all happens 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.940
 this and reboot into recovery 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:04.710
 Well , firstly, of course, do not forget 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:11.430
 first download Acacia firmware 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:12.979
 mod 11 and transfer it copy and gapps 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.170
 it's in the side 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:18.750
 card that is in the external I sit 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.970
 What is the cost of recovery, that is, I can 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.920
 click here I have it there 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.040
 These volume buttons are used for 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:29.790
 Now these data menyushek Switchover 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:33.030
 I'm worth version 6032 but basically the essence 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:36.840
 doesn't just have it let's get started 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:40.770
 to install so you see the main menu 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:43.710
 recovery first we need to clean 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.759
 completely clean the system 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.329
 telephone and 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:51.149
 on fresh phone install firmware 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:53.700
 so let's fourth line it 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.770
 called white data factory reset 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.610
 click on it or something 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:03.869
 physical buttons and so again 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:07.429
 excuse me and click on doing oooo user 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.989
 wipe date i.e. delete data 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:11.620
 Next comes the next line on 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:15.000
 called wabco 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:17.940
 athletic you are at it, too, and press 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.310
 confirm deletion of the cache 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.720
 formatting goes further with us and here 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:27.430
 there is a button 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:32.230
 advanced and wipe dalvik cache you too 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.159
 I have my dalwick and click on mounts and 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.959
 storage 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:41.379
 Here penultimate line search here 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:44.319
 line format systems you me too 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:46.209
 click press entry format that is 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:50.109
 differently we format with you and 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:53.590
 system well now let's go to 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:55.780
 installing the firmware click on the second 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:03:02.019
 the line is called install 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:04.870
 install zip from sd card and in me 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:07.180
 new version so you push and if u 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.780
 you earlier version that is old 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:14.079
 versions click choose zip from sd card 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:19.599
 but in my case a bit and from external sd 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:27.569
 card so fuf again and look for the file 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:27.569
 firmware here it is mod 11 from install and 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:39.540
 waiting somewhere where it is not more than a minute on 

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:39.540
 really no more than a minute 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:51.510
 the firmware is not very good 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.510
 business is still being finalized 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:04:02.200
 why tell you because on the very 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:04.780
 on our smarty sale mod 11 he's in 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:08.740
 First, it is not the same as on the nexus 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:10.660
 This time because the real whale Kata 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:14.250
 is in the nexus 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:17.530
 or other flagship smartphones there 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:25.360
 which are more powerful than ours 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:29.650
 lg optimus l7 so we just 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:34.060
 change the interface so well here and on 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:35.050
 install gaps gaps this application 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.750
 from google 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.860
 and of course they are best 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.130
 set 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:44.590
 and after you installed the firmware 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:48.490
 without leaving recovery so they 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:51.660
 worked correctly so here they are gap 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:56.340
 changing a future 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:58.780
 Well, if necessary, install there 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.330
 radio module but this 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:04.750
 Of course itâ€™s better to install after that 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:07.270
 after launch that is you run if 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.310
 you have a network is not available then look at the site 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.680
 foxdie and dot ru 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:15.730
 which radio module do you need 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:18.760
 download that's all in principle installation 

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:23.080
 firmware successfully successfully excuse me 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:25.840
 finished and then you go to the main 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:30.570
 recovery menu click selected systems cash 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.570
 i.e., reboot your device 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:41.550
 The first sign that your firmware is 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:46.980
 device installed 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:55.460
 how is the appearance of the boot animation what is 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:58.290
 butanimatsiya you now here it will show 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:02.550
 But this is such a thing 

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:06.780
 which shows well here that generally 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:10.680
 Butanimation is here for each firmware 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:15.290
 It is different and its animation can be 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:19.170
 download from the internet like u want but either 

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:22.590
 she you to install this bootanimation 

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:25.280
 Two ways to eat through recovery and through 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:25.280
 root explorer 

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:36.450
 but will not be purely to discuss a first 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:39.570
 the download will be very long I am very long 

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:42.810
 i really that's all really 

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:46.590
 I say nothing more here 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:48.780
 I installed the firmware and I have 

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:54.240
 Unfortunately there is no pause on the camera though 

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:56.310
 very sorry here in general, that's the principle 

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:59.460
 all firmware is installed now somewhere 

00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:01.790
 after five minutes it will start and review 

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:05.100
 already on this firmware that we are now 

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:07.470
 set is on my channel 

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:09.240
 thank you all for watching 

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:14.880
