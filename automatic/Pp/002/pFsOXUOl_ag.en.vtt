very<00:00:18.010> informative<00:00:18.670> post<00:00:19.060> as<00:00:19.449> I<00:00:19.750> started

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:20.170 
very informative post as I started

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.160 
very informative post as I started
working<00:00:20.530> with<00:00:21.250> the<00:00:21.460> instructions<00:00:21.910> I<00:00:22.510> noticed

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:23.170 
working with the instructions I noticed

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.980 
working with the instructions I noticed
that<00:00:23.230> there<00:00:23.440> were<00:00:23.529> a<00:00:23.590> few<00:00:23.860> nuances<00:00:24.270> missing<00:00:25.270> so

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:25.990 
that there were a few nuances missing so

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.800 
that there were a few nuances missing so
I<00:00:26.050> decided<00:00:26.440> to<00:00:26.619> make<00:00:26.800> a<00:00:27.010> screen<00:00:27.550> casts<00:00:27.850> which

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
I decided to make a screen casts which

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.019 
I decided to make a screen casts which
would<00:00:29.020> help<00:00:29.140> others<00:00:29.650> avoid<00:00:29.980> some<00:00:30.850> of<00:00:30.880> the

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:31.029 
would help others avoid some of the

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:33.540 
would help others avoid some of the
frustration<00:00:31.720> and<00:00:31.930> time<00:00:32.410> consuming<00:00:32.829> mistakes

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.550 
frustration and time consuming mistakes

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.880 
frustration and time consuming mistakes
that<00:00:34.149> I<00:00:34.300> made<00:00:34.329> the<00:00:34.840> first<00:00:35.079> step<00:00:35.350> is<00:00:35.530> to<00:00:35.710> go<00:00:35.860> to

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:35.890 
that I made the first step is to go to

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.190 
that I made the first step is to go to
powerpoint<00:00:36.610> and<00:00:36.820> open<00:00:37.180> up<00:00:37.270> your<00:00:37.420> presentation

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:38.200 
powerpoint and open up your presentation

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.990 
powerpoint and open up your presentation
and<00:00:38.260> what<00:00:38.470> you're<00:00:38.590> going<00:00:38.680> to<00:00:38.800> do<00:00:39.010> is<00:00:39.280> save<00:00:39.790> it

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
and what you're going to do is save it

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000 
and what you're going to do is save it
in<00:00:40.149> a<00:00:40.300> graphic<00:00:40.719> format<00:00:41.230> so<00:00:41.469> you<00:00:41.530> can<00:00:41.710> upload

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
in a graphic format so you can upload

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.220 
in a graphic format so you can upload
into<00:00:42.460> flickr<00:00:42.790> so<00:00:43.149> you<00:00:43.239> just<00:00:43.390> go<00:00:43.540> to<00:00:43.600> save<00:00:43.960> as

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230 
into flickr so you just go to save as

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.380 
into flickr so you just go to save as
you<00:00:44.800> go<00:00:44.980> down<00:00:45.160> here<00:00:45.700> and<00:00:45.790> what<00:00:46.149> you're<00:00:46.270> going

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
you go down here and what you're going

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.650 
you go down here and what you're going
to<00:00:46.480> do<00:00:46.660> is<00:00:46.870> select<00:00:47.760> JPEG<00:00:48.760> now<00:00:49.600> the

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:49.660 
to do is select JPEG now the

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.229 
to do is select JPEG now the
instructions<00:00:50.320> that<00:00:50.590> suggested<00:00:51.100> PNG<00:00:51.640> but<00:00:52.210> I

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
instructions that suggested PNG but I

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.229 
instructions that suggested PNG but I
found<00:00:52.570> that<00:00:52.719> it<00:00:53.050> made<00:00:53.860> those<00:00:54.370> files<00:00:54.700> way<00:00:55.180> too

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
found that it made those files way too

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:57.569 
found that it made those files way too
large<00:00:55.660> and<00:00:56.020> took<00:00:56.260> way<00:00:56.710> too<00:00:56.739> much<00:00:57.039> time<00:00:57.280> for<00:00:57.460> me

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:57.579 
large and took way too much time for me

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:59.910 
large and took way too much time for me
to<00:00:57.670> upload<00:00:57.969> into<00:00:58.420> flickr<00:00:58.809> and<00:00:59.050> often<00:00:59.770> the

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
to upload into flickr and often the

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.029 
to upload into flickr and often the
upload<00:01:00.309> would<00:01:00.579> bomb<00:01:00.789> and<00:01:01.180> i'm<00:01:01.840> on<00:01:02.020> a<00:01:02.050> broadband

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:03.039 
upload would bomb and i'm on a broadband

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:05.069 
upload would bomb and i'm on a broadband
connection<00:01:03.520> but<00:01:03.730> not<00:01:03.850> a<00:01:03.879> super<00:01:04.269> fast<00:01:04.509> one<00:01:04.839> if

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:05.079 
connection but not a super fast one if

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:07.319 
connection but not a super fast one if
you're<00:01:05.289> on<00:01:05.379> a<00:01:05.439> super<00:01:05.890> fast<00:01:06.100> connection<00:01:06.759> you

00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:07.329 
you're on a super fast connection you

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:09.779 
you're on a super fast connection you
could<00:01:07.479> probably<00:01:07.719> go<00:01:08.020> with<00:01:08.619> the<00:01:08.740> PNG<00:01:09.340> without

00:01:09.779 --> 00:01:09.789 
could probably go with the PNG without

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:12.959 
could probably go with the PNG without
much<00:01:09.969> problem<00:01:10.509> I<00:01:10.689> didn't<00:01:11.439> notice<00:01:11.829> any<00:01:12.340> loss<00:01:12.729> in

00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:12.969 
much problem I didn't notice any loss in

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:15.029 
much problem I didn't notice any loss in
quality<00:01:12.999> so<00:01:13.749> I'm<00:01:13.810> just<00:01:13.959> going<00:01:14.079> to<00:01:14.139> do<00:01:14.319> save<00:01:14.649> and

00:01:15.029 --> 00:01:15.039 
quality so I'm just going to do save and

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:18.120 
quality so I'm just going to do save and
then<00:01:15.880> you<00:01:16.029> want<00:01:16.240> every<00:01:16.719> slide<00:01:17.049> and<00:01:17.889> what<00:01:18.039> this

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
then you want every slide and what this

each one saved as a JPEG in order so

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:31.349 
each one saved as a JPEG in order so
slide<00:01:29.170> one<00:01:29.439> is<00:01:29.770> the<00:01:30.069> first<00:01:30.099> slide<00:01:30.549> slide<00:01:30.909> 2<00:01:31.179> is

slide one is the first slide slide 2 is
the<00:01:31.509> second<00:01:31.840> slide<00:01:32.229> and<00:01:32.619> so<00:01:32.770> forth<00:01:33.039> now<00:01:34.029> you're

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
the second slide and so forth now you're

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.539

ready<00:01:34.419> to<00:01:34.539> upload<00:01:34.929> your<00:01:35.259> slides<00:01:35.740> and<00:01:36.159> i<00:01:36.310> use

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
ready to upload your slides and i use

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:38.519 
ready to upload your slides and i use
the<00:01:36.849> flickr<00:01:37.119> uploadr<00:01:37.630> tool<00:01:37.929> that<00:01:38.409> you<00:01:38.499> can

00:01:38.519 --> 00:01:38.529 
the flickr uploadr tool that you can

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:40.649 
the flickr uploadr tool that you can
download<00:01:38.889> from<00:01:39.219> flickr<00:01:39.520> it's<00:01:39.880> very<00:01:40.149> efficient

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
download from flickr it's very efficient

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:42.469 
download from flickr it's very efficient
but<00:01:41.200> you<00:01:41.259> got<00:01:41.380> to<00:01:41.409> be<00:01:41.529> careful<00:01:41.740> here<00:01:42.189> because

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
but you got to be careful here because

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.159 
but you got to be careful here because
you<00:01:43.479> need<00:01:43.719> to<00:01:44.529> upload<00:01:45.399> your<00:01:45.849> last<00:01:46.329> slide<00:01:46.659> first

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:47.169 
you need to upload your last slide first

00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:50.069 
you need to upload your last slide first
and<00:01:47.499> your<00:01:47.799> second<00:01:48.219> to<00:01:48.489> last<00:01:48.609> slide<00:01:48.999> second<00:01:49.929> and

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:50.079 
and your second to last slide second and

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:51.539 
and your second to last slide second and
so<00:01:50.289> forth<00:01:50.590> because<00:01:50.919> that's<00:01:51.099> the<00:01:51.310> way<00:01:51.399> the

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549 
so forth because that's the way the

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:53.639 
so forth because that's the way the
script<00:01:51.880> streams<00:01:52.239> them<00:01:52.539> or<00:01:52.779> else<00:01:53.380> your

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
script streams them or else your

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:56.309 
script streams them or else your
presentation<00:01:54.549> will<00:01:54.669> stream<00:01:54.909> backwards<00:01:55.419> so

00:01:56.309 --> 00:01:56.319 
presentation will stream backwards so

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:58.440

onto a blog post so let's go get the

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.680 
onto a blog post so let's go get the
code<00:03:28.710> which<00:03:29.710> is<00:03:29.740> available<00:03:30.490> here<00:03:30.700> at<00:03:31.150> the

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
code which is available here at the

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.870 
code which is available here at the
digital<00:03:32.500> inspiration<00:03:33.070> site<00:03:33.400> and<00:03:33.670> I'm

i'm just doing ctrl c and i'm copying it

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.100 
i'm just doing ctrl c and i'm copying it
into<00:03:41.950> the<00:03:42.040> clipboard<00:03:42.280> and<00:03:42.910> i'm<00:03:43.480> moving<00:03:43.930> now

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
into the clipboard and i'm moving now

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.190

over to my blog post and i'm cutting and
pasting<00:03:47.290> it<00:03:47.650> in<00:03:47.830> there<00:03:48.870> now<00:03:49.870> comes<00:03:50.170> the<00:03:50.380> tricky

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
pasting it in there now comes the tricky

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.630 
pasting it in there now comes the tricky
part<00:03:51.040> if<00:03:51.850> you're<00:03:52.030> not<00:03:52.180> comfortable<00:03:52.840> with<00:03:53.640> Java
