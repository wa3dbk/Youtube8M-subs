 So what is it you want to do with baseball ? 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:04.809
 While I 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:08.890
 I do not need salary and I do not need yin and yang. 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:13.630
 I'm going to take me and make me work harder as an uncle. 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:16.930

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:45.110
 But now that I think about it, what's wrong with me? 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:49.040
 Someone told me that. 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.210
 I said 'cause I've tried not to think there is a problem you need to tell me now what 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.050
 Yes, I did. 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:57.110
 The moment I hear the words of the lorry, 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:02:00.590
 * If the director is hopeful of the month, why do not you come to Kenya 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:05.450
 With that in mind, I got to reflect on it. 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:10.160
 I look forward to seeing you in 2010 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:15.020
 Wow, World, what did not you already call the director 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:19.100
 4 I am now playing my role in the World Cup , 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:23.300
 I have not one word Tong's how it gave starting 4 weeks 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:26.959
 But he did not even say I could not do it too well . 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:31.220
 So I think sometimes if you say to become a word now into 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:36.050
 And because he caused you know about alahyaji not so far-no party hoenggyeri 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:40.840
 Tell me I can not be a coach. 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:48.180
 But now, before the last Spanish game, 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:48.180
 Yes I did call and wait portable afraid to look ahtta did the word 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:58.030
 Now, I've been a little when you think ah it hasineunde 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:03:03.520
 Are you a look at coming to a hair removal Yes 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:08.340
 Oh, but now I ask the bishop of the last transabdominal canal I come 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:10.319
 If it does not spread just I'm just tried my prayers 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.930
 4 and 4 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:17.739
 Give me the first oceans 5 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:24.519
 It's just an excuse to hurt yourself . 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:28.269
 If you can not do it, you will not be able to do it. 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:32.140
 Look at what we estimate is the worst of Ghana's condition . 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:36.879
 I pray that one's really calculated as 30 minutes 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:39.790
 Furthermore, too much really did not stir a couple of months is two months old 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:43.810
 I prayed sincerely. 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:48.160
 I made you make it Oh yeonhwan keep it so too 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:50.590
 Yeah , I did not have a hole to get out of it at the time. 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:55.480
 I really like to slump about 10 months 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:57.040
 There are a lot of things I realized as I was going through the proclamation. 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:03.129
 There is no impossible. 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:04.959
 The talent of four people 1% of effort 99% 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:09.760
 The sermon that can not be done is medicine. 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:14.620
 Why is it that when a person does not work, nothing happens. 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:19.930
 No matter how much I try, I can not escape. 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:22.150
 If you do something funny on the turn then you die and left more to your friends 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:25.690
 G 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:30.099
 In such a way, 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:35.900
 Putting to evolve and be out of the slump should be good to rest a little kid me that 

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:40.190
 If you have an idea , how do you do it through the slump? 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:45.950
 At that time, 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:47.450
 Your fans on YouTube have put up like this for you to play. 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:52.070
 I've been watching. 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:56.660
 I used to play soccer so well in the old days, but now I can not 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:57.290
 The idea that someday you will be able to do it, 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:02.000
 I did not. 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:05.410
 Oh, the source is exactly the same. 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.410
