00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:07.020
 hello to all so today I'm going 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.330
 show you how a good laugh 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:13.799
 share and find out how she is ready 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:18.960
 so once the ingredients are 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:23.550
 mix well so we're going to knead her 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:27.920
 movements like this good if it's not 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:30.029
 it does not matter 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.640
 to be sorted out a pac so that they 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.870
 be well taken it takes 5 to 10 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.140
 minutes and put some energy into the 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.140
 strength 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.710
 and 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:15.300
 so usually a thumb with the palm 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:18.710
 like that we bring back the dough up with a 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.710
 little training in iran 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.600
 so here now to check if 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.760
 a paste 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.660
 she is well prepared so we take a 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:36.880
 paw like these it's still 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.380
 a little in the flour is a little more 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.950
 easy 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:48.210
 and then we'll switch it off slowly for 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:48.210
 see if she has a lot of asti cited 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:04.890
 so the dough must be well elastic on 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:06.930
 almost see through like that who 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.530
 is no thread then that does not tear 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.570
 right now 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.320
 so again the chest a very small 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.320
 a little a minute 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.650
 here 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.690
 like this 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.610
 zapater ready
