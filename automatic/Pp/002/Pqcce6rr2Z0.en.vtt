difficulties although even more amazing

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.580

killed<00:02:43.959> like<00:02:44.019> most<00:02:44.320> NPCs<00:02:44.860> of<00:02:44.980> the<00:02:45.070> world<00:02:45.250> did

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
killed like most NPCs of the world did

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.370 
killed like most NPCs of the world did
they<00:02:46.090> returned<00:02:46.390> fire<00:02:46.690> and<00:02:46.720> even<00:02:47.110> take<00:02:47.260> out

so<00:02:52.060> the<00:02:52.150> single<00:02:52.390> player<00:02:52.480> is<00:02:52.690> good<00:02:52.840> and

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:52.960 
so the single player is good and

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.180 
so the single player is good and
probably<00:02:53.140> about<00:02:53.470> what<00:02:53.620> you<00:02:53.740> would<00:02:53.800> expect
