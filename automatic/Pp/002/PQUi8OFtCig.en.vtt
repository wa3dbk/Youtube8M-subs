so I've sunk it in the water but I'm
perfectly<00:02:52.160> fine<00:02:52.220> because<00:02:52.489> I'm<00:02:52.670> not<00:02:52.820> gonna<00:02:52.970> die

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
perfectly fine because I'm not gonna die

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.300

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
because there's no survival mode with

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.720 
because there's no survival mode with
minecraft<00:02:55.820> or<00:02:56.630> the<00:02:57.560> PI<00:02:57.769> version<00:02:58.190> of<00:02:58.280> Minecraft

minecraft or the PI version of Minecraft

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.319 
minecraft or the PI version of Minecraft
yet<00:02:59.000> I<00:02:59.269> do<00:02:59.870> not<00:03:00.170> know<00:03:00.350> how<00:03:00.530> to<00:03:00.590> fire<00:03:00.860> this

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329 
yet I do not know how to fire this

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:14.530 
yet I do not know how to fire this
because<00:03:02.329> I'm<00:03:02.480> an<00:03:02.600> idiot

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.270 

sticking<00:03:15.230> it<00:03:15.290> or<00:03:15.470> to<00:03:15.620> kill<00:03:15.830> things<00:03:16.010> with<00:03:16.190> the

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
sticking it or to kill things with the

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:24.070 
sticking it or to kill things with the
door<00:03:16.900> door<00:03:17.900> ality<00:03:19.989> yep<00:03:22.690> but<00:03:23.690> there<00:03:23.810> is<00:03:23.900> no

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
door door ality yep but there is no

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.570 
door door ality yep but there is no
things<00:03:24.290> that<00:03:24.440> I<00:03:24.470> can<00:03:24.680> kill<00:03:24.890> because<00:03:25.160> this<00:03:25.400> is

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
things that I can kill because this is

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:36.670 
things that I can kill because this is
creative<00:03:26.510> mode<00:03:26.690> not<00:03:26.989> classic<00:03:27.739> or<00:03:28.209> survival

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.660 

yeah

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.580 

just<00:03:42.300> drop<00:03:42.480> down<00:03:42.630> this<00:03:42.780> hole<00:03:43.170> that<00:03:43.470> I<00:03:43.560> dug

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
just drop down this hole that I dug

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:50.479 
just drop down this hole that I dug
earlier<00:03:46.040> this<00:03:47.040> is<00:03:47.160> just<00:03:49.040> I'm<00:03:50.040> just<00:03:50.099> pretty

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
earlier this is just I'm just pretty

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.390 
earlier this is just I'm just pretty
much<00:03:50.670> playing<00:03:50.970> around<00:03:51.239> with<00:03:51.480> this<00:03:51.739> as<00:03:52.739> you<00:03:53.250> can

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
much playing around with this as you can

00:03:53.400 --> 00:04:03.839 
much playing around with this as you can
kind<00:03:53.880> of<00:03:53.940> tell

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:03.849 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:05.339 

I<00:04:03.879> think<00:04:04.330> these<00:04:04.420> are<00:04:04.480> pretty<00:04:04.720> much<00:04:04.900> all<00:04:05.110> make

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:05.349 
I think these are pretty much all make

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:09.449 
I think these are pretty much all make
the<00:04:05.500> one<00:04:05.739> side<00:04:06.099> are<00:04:06.430> from<00:04:06.489> this<00:04:06.760> one<00:04:07.890> no<00:04:08.890> change

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
the one side are from this one no change

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:10.460 
the one side are from this one no change
sides

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
sides

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.789 
sides
but<00:04:11.610> yeah<00:04:12.610> I'd<00:04:13.480> Douglas<00:04:13.900> because<00:04:14.019> I<00:04:14.230> was<00:04:14.349> bored

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
but yeah I'd Douglas because I was bored

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:17.069 
but yeah I'd Douglas because I was bored
and<00:04:14.980> I<00:04:15.430> might<00:04:15.610> change<00:04:15.849> these<00:04:16.150> stairs<00:04:16.570> because

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079

dashboard so for more proof that it is
running<00:05:22.060> on<00:05:22.180> the<00:05:22.270> Raspberry<00:05:22.360> Pi<00:05:22.690> so<00:05:23.199> I<00:05:23.440> will

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
running on the Raspberry Pi so I will

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.350 
running on the Raspberry Pi so I will
see<00:05:23.860> use<00:05:24.039> all<00:05:24.190> later

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360
