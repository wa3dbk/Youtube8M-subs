00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.099
 hello friends to led tv rock solutions 

00:00:09.749 --> 00:00:14.450
 and today I'm going to teach how to make a 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.450
 Brigadier beer 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.150
 Peter 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.529
 it is only very simple this recipe so 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.390
 simple as the traditional brigadier 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.650
 first step let's reduce beer 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.410
 at half 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.680
 one can produce approximately 200 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.680
 mL 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.700
 the gaucho 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.320
 now that our beer has 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.630
 half we are going to put the num 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.380
 refractory and let them create until 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.380
 reaches room temperature 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.570
 now that our beer has already cooled 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:06.460
 Let's put it in the pan and add the milk. 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.479
 condensed milk and margarine and we 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.479
 stirring until you reach the point 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.840
 the glory 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.840
 the spanish 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.300
 was good 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.550
 I know the staff is there, then. 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.470

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.300
