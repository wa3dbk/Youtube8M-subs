00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:42.639 
trying to play so that's pretty much one

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:46.470 
trying to play so that's pretty much one
of<00:03:42.669> the<00:03:42.790> main<00:03:42.940> keys<00:03:43.329> um<00:03:44.910> you<00:03:45.910> will<00:03:46.060> have<00:03:46.239> to<00:03:46.329> get

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
of the main keys um you will have to get

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.539 
of the main keys um you will have to get
used<00:03:46.660> to<00:03:46.900> pulling<00:03:47.590> the<00:03:47.650> trigger<00:03:47.709> with<00:03:48.160> your

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:48.549 
used to pulling the trigger with your

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:51.839 
used to pulling the trigger with your
middle<00:03:48.730> finger<00:03:49.290> so<00:03:50.290> if<00:03:50.440> you<00:03:50.680> don't<00:03:51.639> know<00:03:51.699> maybe

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:51.849 
middle finger so if you don't know maybe

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:52.890 
middle finger so if you don't know maybe
have<00:03:52.030> a<00:03:52.090> trigger<00:03:52.329> finger<00:03:52.540> with<00:03:52.629> this<00:03:52.720> finger

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
have a trigger finger with this finger

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.750 
have a trigger finger with this finger
not<00:03:53.199> with<00:03:53.349> this<00:03:53.470> finger<00:03:53.680> it's<00:03:54.430> going<00:03:54.609> to<00:03:54.669> have

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
not with this finger it's going to have

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.000 
not with this finger it's going to have
to<00:03:54.819> get<00:03:54.910> used<00:03:55.090> to<00:03:55.239> that<00:03:55.470> but<00:03:56.470> that's<00:03:56.530> about<00:03:56.949> it

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
to get used to that but that's about it

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.789 
to get used to that but that's about it
I<00:03:57.489> mean<00:03:58.269> it's<00:03:58.419> really<00:03:58.540> not<00:03:58.780> complicated<00:03:59.049> it

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
I mean it's really not complicated it

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.250 
I mean it's really not complicated it
just<00:04:00.010> takes<00:04:00.310> a<00:04:00.609> long<00:04:01.389> time<00:04:01.449> getting<00:04:01.900> used<00:04:01.959> to

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
just takes a long time getting used to

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.500 
just takes a long time getting used to
it<00:04:02.440> can<00:04:02.590> start<00:04:02.829> to<00:04:02.949> hurt<00:04:03.099> your<00:04:03.220> finger<00:04:03.579> after<00:04:04.480> a

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
it can start to hurt your finger after a

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.390 
it can start to hurt your finger after a
