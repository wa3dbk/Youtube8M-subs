00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
you know you do this part nine eight six

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.300 
you know you do this part nine eight six
and<00:00:03.360> today<00:00:04.049> I'm<00:00:04.140> going<00:00:04.319> to<00:00:04.440> do<00:00:04.560> a<00:00:04.589> review<00:00:05.040> on

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
and today I'm going to do a review on

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.129 
and today I'm going to do a review on
the<00:00:06.210> Kingston<00:00:06.750> DataTraveler<00:00:08.360> generation<00:00:09.360> 3j3

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
the Kingston DataTraveler generation 3j3

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.999 
the Kingston DataTraveler generation 3j3
which<00:00:10.889> is<00:00:11.130> a<00:00:11.519> USB<00:00:12.000> flash<00:00:12.030> right<00:00:12.450> and<00:00:12.799> here's<00:00:13.799> on

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
which is a USB flash right and here's on

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.540 
which is a USB flash right and here's on
the<00:00:14.130> case<00:00:14.370> like<00:00:14.610> it<00:00:15.120> comes<00:00:15.450> in<00:00:15.680> four<00:00:16.680> I<00:00:17.100> think

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
the case like it comes in four I think

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.769 
the case like it comes in four I think
here<00:00:17.880> for<00:00:20.210> it<00:00:21.210> comes<00:00:21.660> in<00:00:21.900> five<00:00:22.380> different

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:23.779 
here for it comes in five different

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:27.679 
here for it comes in five different
capacities<00:00:24.810> one<00:00:25.590> is<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.859> 2gb<00:00:26.310> mopping<00:00:26.849> ii<00:00:27.420> 4G

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
capacities one is the 2gb mopping ii 4G

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.030 
capacities one is the 2gb mopping ii 4G
with<00:00:28.140> 8<00:00:28.650> GB<00:00:29.099> for<00:00:29.720> 16<00:00:30.720> GB<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.230> finally<00:00:31.859> the

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
with 8 GB for 16 GB and finally the

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.190 
with 8 GB for 16 GB and finally the
fifth<00:00:32.279> said<00:00:32.940> 2zv<00:00:33.480> so<00:00:34.350> I<00:00:34.860> have<00:00:35.670> half<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.270> dead

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
fifth said 2zv so I have half the dead

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.880 
fifth said 2zv so I have half the dead
traveler<00:00:37.680> g3<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.960> I<00:00:39.960> parted<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.469> couple<00:00:40.739> days

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
traveler g3 and I parted a couple days

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.889 
traveler g3 and I parted a couple days
before<00:00:41.989> so<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.140> is<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.430> white<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.730> yellow<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.480> GB

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
before so it is a white and yellow a GB

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.529 
before so it is a white and yellow a GB
model<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.890> this<00:00:47.760> is<00:00:47.820> really<00:00:48.090> compact

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
model and this is really compact

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.600 
model and this is really compact
compared<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.739> other<00:00:49.860> drives<00:00:50.219> you<00:00:50.460> can

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
compared to the other drives you can

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:57.410 
compared to the other drives you can
compare<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.270> her<00:00:51.390> hand<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:51.960> here<00:00:52.559> this<00:00:56.420> so

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
compare it to her hand and here this so

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.439 
compare it to her hand and here this so
I<00:00:57.989> think<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.739> is<00:00:58.770> pretty<00:00:59.129> compact<00:00:59.640> on<00:01:00.239> that

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
I think it is pretty compact on that

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.310 
I think it is pretty compact on that
from<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.620> older<00:01:01.980> models<00:01:02.399> because<00:01:03.320> two

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
from you to the older models because two

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.120 
from you to the older models because two
years<00:01:04.350> ago<00:01:04.650> I<00:01:04.860> had<00:01:05.220> 2<00:01:05.700> GB<00:01:06.150> 1<00:01:06.409> 2<00:01:07.409> GB<00:01:07.710> Kingston

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
years ago I had 2 GB 1 2 GB Kingston

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.850 
years ago I had 2 GB 1 2 GB Kingston
Drive<00:01:08.369> which<00:01:08.640> were<00:01:08.820> back<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:10.290> was<00:01:10.470> larger

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
Drive which were back and it was larger

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.170 
Drive which were back and it was larger
than<00:01:10.890> this<00:01:11.330> it<00:01:12.330> was<00:01:12.540> 2<00:01:12.750> GB<00:01:13.080> arrows<00:01:13.409> larger<00:01:13.890> and

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
than this it was 2 GB arrows larger and

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.469 
than this it was 2 GB arrows larger and
but<00:01:15.180> this<00:01:15.420> is<00:01:15.570> 8<00:01:15.840> GB<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.560> it's<00:01:16.799> smaller<00:01:17.280> so

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
but this is 8 GB and it's smaller so

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.130 
but this is 8 GB and it's smaller so
that's<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.659> difference

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
that's the difference

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.679 
that's the difference
and<00:01:19.290> it's<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.159> data<00:01:20.340> strategy<00:01:20.640> 3<00:01:21.439> so<00:01:23.509> you<00:01:24.509> can

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
and it's the data strategy 3 so you can

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.960 
and it's the data strategy 3 so you can
see<00:01:24.869> I'm<00:01:25.020> on<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.350> website<00:01:25.830> here<00:01:26.130> Kingston<00:01:26.700> and

inside

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:10.650 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.620 

terrible<00:02:11.650> digit<00:02:12.310> potage<00:02:12.880> this<00:02:13.120> comes<00:02:13.390> off

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
terrible digit potage this comes off

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.440 
terrible digit potage this comes off
right<00:02:13.930> for<00:02:14.320> if<00:02:14.920> you<00:02:15.100> pull<00:02:15.670> it<00:02:15.820> it<00:02:15.940> comes<00:02:16.210> off

right for if you pull it it comes off

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.040 
right for if you pull it it comes off
and<00:02:16.780> there's<00:02:17.110> no<00:02:17.260> mechanical<00:02:17.880> but<00:02:18.880> the<00:02:19.270> head

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
and there's no mechanical but the head

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.190 
and there's no mechanical but the head
is<00:02:20.610> if<00:02:21.610> you<00:02:21.820> can<00:02:22.000> smaller<00:02:22.420> and<00:02:22.750> you<00:02:22.840> can<00:02:22.990> also

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:31.950 

plug<00:02:26.200> the<00:02:26.410> top<00:02:26.650> back<00:02:27.100> on<00:02:27.630> top<00:02:28.650> on<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:29.830> back<00:02:30.960> so

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
plug the top back on top on the back so

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.740 
plug the top back on top on the back so
it<00:02:32.230> is<00:02:32.350> how<00:02:32.620> it<00:02:32.770> looks<00:02:33.040> when<00:02:33.130> the<00:02:33.430> cap<00:02:33.700> is<00:02:33.880> put

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
it is how it looks when the cap is put

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.280 
it is how it looks when the cap is put
on<00:02:34.870> this<00:02:35.050> back<00:02:35.410> and<00:02:35.740> this<00:02:36.130> is<00:02:36.280> our<00:02:37.050> it<00:02:38.050> looks

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
on this back and this is our it looks

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.780 
on this back and this is our it looks
when<00:02:38.590> their<00:02:39.030> cap<00:02:40.030> is<00:02:40.330> not<00:02:40.600> put<00:02:40.870> on<00:02:41.050> this<00:02:41.260> back

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
when their cap is not put on this back

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.360 
when their cap is not put on this back
so<00:02:42.790> as<00:02:43.060> you<00:02:43.300> see<00:02:43.510> there's<00:02:44.500> a<00:02:44.620> light<00:02:45.040> chain

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370
