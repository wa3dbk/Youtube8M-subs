00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:19.980
 Thank you very much Steffen Kießling 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.900
 always said that I can grab it 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:54.989
 but unfortunately I never got the chance 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:57.530
 given 30 gates how should i do that 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.530
 because pack 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.189
 I'll show you what's going on 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.170
 friendly welcome to the 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.479
 second episode of kießling's photo dfb 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.880
 for the time being even fat thank you to you 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.369
 the last episode has over 100 likes 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.810
 get and almost 1000 calls with it 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.900
 I did not expect it 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.159
 design the most blatant just with w and yes 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.780
 you have heard the challenge 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.920
 was changed a bit but me 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.390
 So not so much about the hot 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.350
 porridge we'll see each other when we have one 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.640
 have found opponents 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.659
 Here I am then again her 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.189
 wrote me in the comments 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.329
 that I have the flamingos tribus 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.650
 or the queens park rangers 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.700
 should buy regus 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.740
 I did not do that now 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.840
 play the queens park rangers jersey 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.860
 they are the right ones to pulsate 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.240
 So was similar was after any case 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.920
 really good suggestions that you have me there 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.630
 written in the comments has 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.770
 thank you very much and yes - the jerseys and 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.770
 look at the team of today 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:52.590
 opponent to 380 rating 118i 1 league 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:55.680
 bbva team with benzema factory us war 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.299
 So you have a strong team but the 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.759
 kießling he will hopefully be a few 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.079
 Shooting gates has nine goals and has 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.310
 it has now hit against bavaria too 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.130
 good definitely signs that the 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.880
 penetrate today is my friends the 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.550
 National team enters the race 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.190
 really good jerseys too 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.110
 miller 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.640
 But miller cracks now time to get out in 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.860
 the middle is the stefan kießling the 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.750
 flank comes and stefan kießling 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.970
 unfortunately not with the first chance 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.700
 go in and yes now we change first 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.010
 again the screen for a miller 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:28.270
 Schiedmann with the flank they are good 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.960
 out and there is the 1 0 by ppr should 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.400
 I say to that 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:35.770
 kiessling plays the ball on hammels 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:38.260
 hammer wonder from kießling kießling am 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.840
 ball is good 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.030
 with a few jobs with the advertiser spin 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.160
 on the reus and reus shoots 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.080
 have students 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:50.170
 that can not be here always 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.420
 This fifa is missing but the jansen sees 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:56.670
 the student or the kießling 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.670
 what does he do there kießling the ball 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.000
 different this time 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.370
 it was already five mistakes from 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.350
 features made his goalkeeper thomas 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.880
 Of course we do not like it 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.840
 and the kießling used that mercilessly 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.940
 out 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.440
 Look again and then haute 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.030
 simply insert the ball into the empty goal 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.980
 with the tenth hit stefan kienzl 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.290
 thus when times effort tor 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.380
 and newer can keep the ball 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.120
 Schweinsteiger back on Götze 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.470
 suddenly the outer line cracks the looks 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.690
 we go back and to the flank too 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.300
 bring and as kießling and the power 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.590
 the gate through the eating over 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.900
 and now he is doing his planned one again 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.830
 cheers here four really catch that 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.540
 is sensational 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.490
 Schürrle scored his eleventh goal for 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.680
 the german national team my 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.270
 friends that I can say that 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.830
 is really fantastic that is fantastic 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.390
 beautiful kießling must in the 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.140
 national team writes your opinion 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.940
 in the comments 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.230
 Götze with the flank there is kießling 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:58.600
 kießling with the gate 32 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.580
 really knows because what is going on with 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.260
 3 and then wrinkled at half- time 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.580
 1 kießling with three hits 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.830
 really really strong again 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.820
 he plays a lot of fun here and me now 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.920
 at the second half 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.840
 he wants kießling is only gefoult 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.310
 Already frustration with them here 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.380
 see and now he just whistles us 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.150
 we do not care about the advantage here 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.150
 Of course just like that run only through 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.580
 Stefan Kießling 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:23.230
 then it is unfair you have to 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:25.480
 it 'll be punished with the red card 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:27.250
 is with a red card punishes 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.020
 Of course, that would have been a sure goal 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.450
 Of course we hope that the pillow is 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:34.720
 In free kick there is stefan 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:36.880
 kießling but he just can not 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.400
 Free kicks are not his specialty 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:42.130
 like the ball on the foot 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.140
 Kiessling now made strong by 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.419
 kießling kießling closes pipe 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:48.400
 but because that keeps the ball right 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:50.169
 strong and there is a corner idiot with 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.409
 The corner is where the idea stands 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:56.639
 kießling and finally makes the goal 

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:58.649
 with the 4 and I really know 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:59.699
 not anymore, I'm so fed up 

00:04:58.649 --> 00:05:02.369
 on this but I always forget 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:03.749
 again the gates of kießling 

00:05:02.369 --> 00:05:05.669
 I do not know why in any case 

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:10.349
 her wrong, yes he has so many gates 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:12.059
 now shot now as a student 

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:13.679
 on kießling and kießling with the vor 

00:05:12.059 --> 00:05:14.519
 I know it's here right now 

00:05:13.679 --> 00:05:16.050
 was played but it goes of course 

00:05:14.519 --> 00:05:17.189
 because the church makes the gates 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.169
 that would be easy 

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:20.610
 but can connect were 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:22.110
 stubborn and then has on the box 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.449
 I hope you do not mind me 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.919
 and I really understand the fun 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:27.479
 the series look what we years again 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:29.129
 he really sees and then for the 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:31.829
 ball good smack and again 

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:33.599
 Another goal for Stefan Kießling and 

00:05:31.829 --> 00:05:35.189
 then the referee whistles from the casting 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:36.300
 shoots five goals in the last 

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:38.320
 follow on 9 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:41.410
 thus he has 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.790
 bling bling bling 14 gates and that makes 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:44.350
 for example, I'm a really strong one 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:46.810
 the balance is almost so strong 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:48.610
 as the name and leave it at that 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:50.170
 with the second episode of kießling's photo 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.610
 ddp I hope you liked it 

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:54.010
 I would be very happy about a thumb 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:56.370
 upwards friends tomato clearly says that 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:56.370
 schaar
