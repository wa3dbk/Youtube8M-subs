00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.560 
would probably cook you know normally
you'd<00:01:32.490> want<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.729> do<00:01:32.880> this<00:01:33.000> we're<00:01:33.210> just<00:01:33.240> kind<00:01:33.509> of

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
you'd want to do this we're just kind of

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.060 
you'd want to do this we're just kind of
showing<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:33.900> can<00:01:34.049> do<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.259> anywhere<00:01:34.560> but<00:01:34.979> if

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
showing you can do it anywhere but if

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.050 
showing you can do it anywhere but if
you're<00:01:35.159> on<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.340> grow<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.640> against<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:35.909> nice

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
you're on to grow and against a nice

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.880 
you're on to grow and against a nice
wood<00:01:36.240> fire<00:01:36.509> or<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:36.900> got<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.140> charcoals<00:01:37.560> going

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
wood fire or you got the charcoals going

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.160 
wood fire or you got the charcoals going
you<00:01:38.369> know<00:01:38.460> probably<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.600> good<00:01:39.810> three<00:01:40.049> minutes

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
you know probably a good three minutes

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.170 
you know probably a good three minutes
yeah<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:41.009> almost<00:01:41.130> really<00:01:41.460> can't<00:01:41.759> overcook<00:01:42.119> it

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
yeah you almost really can't overcook it

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.330 
yeah you almost really can't overcook it
and<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.750> smells<00:01:42.960> so<00:01:43.200> good<00:01:43.500> I've<00:01:43.680> never<00:01:43.920> heard<00:01:44.070> I

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
and it smells so good I've never heard I

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.399 
and it smells so good I've never heard I
never<00:01:44.369> thought<00:01:44.759> lettuce<00:01:45.659> with<00:01:45.869> no<00:01:46.140> it'll

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
never thought lettuce with no it'll

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.170 
never thought lettuce with no it'll
really<00:01:46.530> take<00:01:46.799> on<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:46.950> nice<00:01:47.159> meat<00:01:47.430> quality<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:48.149> it

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
really take on a nice meat quality to it

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.060 
really take on a nice meat quality to it
will<00:01:48.990> really<00:01:49.200> let<00:01:49.380> that<00:01:49.560> thing<00:01:49.710> grill<00:01:49.950> up

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
will really let that thing grill up

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.350 
will really let that thing grill up
nicely<00:01:51.500> ok<00:01:52.500> so<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.799> lettuce<00:01:53.670> is<00:01:53.759> done<00:01:53.939> lettuce

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
nicely ok so the lettuce is done lettuce

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.910 
nicely ok so the lettuce is done lettuce
is<00:01:54.450> gone<00:01:54.630> I've<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:54.899> lot<00:01:55.110> four<00:01:55.290> minutes<00:01:55.560> there's

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
is gone I've a lot four minutes there's

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.550 
is gone I've a lot four minutes there's
been<00:01:56.070> four<00:01:56.280> minutes<00:01:56.579> long<00:01:56.930> okay<00:01:57.930> so<00:01:58.409> you<00:01:58.469> can

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
been four minutes long okay so you can

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.539 
been four minutes long okay so you can
see<00:01:58.680> we<00:01:58.770> probably<00:01:58.979> cooked<00:01:59.219> out<00:01:59.369> about

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
see we probably cooked out about

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.280 
see we probably cooked out about
twenty-five<00:02:00.000> percent<00:02:00.119> of<00:02:00.390> that<00:02:00.420> water<00:02:00.719> okay

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
twenty-five percent of that water okay

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.270 
twenty-five percent of that water okay
you<00:02:01.350> can<00:02:01.530> see<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.740> difference<00:02:02.040> between<00:02:02.100> the

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
you can see the difference between the

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.499 
you can see the difference between the
whole<00:02:02.399> head<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:02.700> what<00:02:02.820> it<00:02:02.909> is<00:02:03.000> right<00:02:03.270> this

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
whole head and what it is right this

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.840 
whole head and what it is right this
one's<00:02:03.719> a<00:02:03.810> lot<00:02:03.930> bigger<00:02:03.990> yep<00:02:04.979> it's<00:02:05.549> where<00:02:05.759> the

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
one's a lot bigger yep it's where the

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.520 
one's a lot bigger yep it's where the
cook<00:02:06.060> one<00:02:06.240> is<00:02:06.390> what<00:02:06.899> we're<00:02:06.990> gonna<00:02:07.110> do<00:02:07.290> is<00:02:07.409> get

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
cook one is what we're gonna do is get

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.779 
cook one is what we're gonna do is get
that<00:02:07.680> chopped<00:02:07.979> up<00:02:08.190> got<00:02:08.520> it

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
that chopped up got it

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.420 
that chopped up got it
big<00:02:08.939> because<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.509> water<00:02:09.689> is<00:02:09.780> off<00:02:09.989> correct

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:10.430 
big because the water is off correct

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.920 
big because the water is off correct
really<00:02:11.430> intensify<00:02:12.030> that<00:02:12.150> flavor<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.629> lettuce

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
really intensify that flavor the lettuce

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.009 
really intensify that flavor the lettuce

this part of the lettuce what is this

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:58.520 
this part of the lettuce what is this
call<00:02:56.129> this<00:02:56.549> is<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:56.819> route<00:02:57.000> during<00:02:57.359> the<00:02:58.290> core

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
call this is the route during the core

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.159 
call this is the route during the core

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
can but it's a very fibrous and very

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.970 
can but it's a very fibrous and very
tough<00:03:03.180> so<00:03:03.419> a<00:03:03.450> lot<00:03:03.629> of<00:03:03.659> people<00:03:03.930> don't<00:03:04.139> they<00:03:04.769> cut

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
tough so a lot of people don't they cut

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.860 
tough so a lot of people don't they cut
around<00:03:05.069> it<00:03:05.370> if<00:03:05.790> you<00:03:05.879> want<00:03:06.060> to<00:03:06.120> really<00:03:06.209> cut<00:03:06.780> out

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
around it if you want to really cut out

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:07.909 
around it if you want to really cut out
a<00:03:06.900> piece<00:03:06.989> of<00:03:07.139> lettuce<00:03:07.349> you<00:03:07.470> just<00:03:07.620> cut<00:03:07.799> that

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:07.919 
a piece of lettuce you just cut that

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:11.179 
a piece of lettuce you just cut that
right<00:03:08.099> out<00:03:08.280> and<00:03:09.239> when<00:03:09.359> it<00:03:09.480> pops<00:03:09.689> up<00:03:10.019> no<00:03:10.859> going

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:11.189 
right out and when it pops up no going

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:13.580 
right out and when it pops up no going
out<00:03:11.220> so<00:03:11.519> ya<00:03:11.700> know<00:03:12.019> we'll<00:03:13.019> just<00:03:13.199> count<00:03:13.319> it<00:03:13.440> all
