00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
but there is a secret ingredient and

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.700 
but there is a secret ingredient and
that<00:00:19.199> is<00:00:19.529> yeasted<00:00:20.220> dough<00:00:20.460> I<00:00:20.730> usually<00:00:21.449> use<00:00:21.710> the

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
that is yeasted dough I usually use the

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.890 
that is yeasted dough I usually use the
yeast<00:00:22.949> that's<00:00:23.160> been<00:00:23.400> proved<00:00:23.760> I<00:00:23.939> used<00:00:24.210> that<00:00:24.449> to

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
yeast that's been proved I used that to

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.660 
yeast that's been proved I used that to
mix<00:00:25.109> it<00:00:25.260> into<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.590> Atta<00:00:26.039> for<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.490> aloo

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
mix it into the Atta for the aloo

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.150 
mix it into the Atta for the aloo
paratha<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.240> it<00:00:27.930> does<00:00:28.109> turn<00:00:28.320> out<00:00:28.529> that<00:00:28.560> these

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
paratha and it does turn out that these

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.429 
paratha and it does turn out that these
paratha<00:00:29.580> stay<00:00:29.910> really<00:00:30.300> soft<00:00:30.570> for<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:30.869> long<00:00:31.109> time

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
paratha stay really soft for a long time

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.590 
paratha stay really soft for a long time
and<00:00:31.679> because<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.520> door<00:00:32.700> stretches<00:00:33.210> well<00:00:33.420> it

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
and because the door stretches well it

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.930 
and because the door stretches well it
can<00:00:33.809> fill<00:00:34.050> in<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.290> lot<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:35.370> are<00:00:35.520> you<00:00:35.670> filling

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
can fill in a lot of the are you filling

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.440 
can fill in a lot of the are you filling
so<00:00:36.750> let's<00:00:37.320> see<00:00:37.559> how<00:00:38.100> we<00:00:38.160> make<00:00:38.520> this<00:00:38.730> sub<00:00:39.180> used

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
so let's see how we make this sub used

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.410 
so let's see how we make this sub used
multigrain<00:00:40.079> are<00:00:40.530> tough<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:41.010> make<00:00:41.190> this<00:00:41.760> dough

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
multigrain are tough to make this dough

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.900 
multigrain are tough to make this dough
and<00:00:42.660> there<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:43.410> yeast<00:00:43.649> in<00:00:43.890> this<00:00:44.040> dough<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.489> I

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
and there is yeast in this dough and I

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.970 
and there is yeast in this dough and I
allowed<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.420> sit<00:00:45.660> after<00:00:45.960> I<00:00:46.469> needed<00:00:46.829> it<00:00:46.950> for

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
allowed to sit after I needed it for

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.950 
allowed to sit after I needed it for
around<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.760> 1<00:00:47.969> hour<00:00:48.149> until<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:48.539> doubled<00:00:48.870> in

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
around the 1 hour until it doubled in

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.319 
around the 1 hour until it doubled in
volume<00:00:49.110> so<00:00:49.530> now<00:00:50.309> I'm<00:00:50.489> going<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.820> take<00:00:51.059> a

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
volume so now I'm going to take a

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.160 
volume so now I'm going to take a
portion<00:00:51.809> of<00:00:52.110> this<00:00:53.270> if<00:00:54.270> it<00:00:54.449> sticking<00:00:54.870> you<00:00:54.989> can

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
portion of this if it sticking you can

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.939

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
always add some bit of flour and then

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:04.189 
always add some bit of flour and then
use<00:00:58.949> it<00:01:01.129> and<00:01:02.129> these<00:01:02.940> are<00:01:03.019> boiled<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.140> mashed

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
see I have filled in quite a bit of

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.149 
see I have filled in quite a bit of
stuffing<00:01:45.860> now<00:01:46.860> I<00:01:46.890> just<00:01:47.899> please<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.259> top<00:01:49.799> and

bit of luck I'll roll it out if you find

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.500 
bit of luck I'll roll it out if you find
that<00:02:13.709> your<00:02:13.890> potato<00:02:14.280> filling<00:02:14.490> is<00:02:14.730> not<00:02:14.910> very<00:02:15.180> dry

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
that your potato filling is not very dry

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.300 
that your potato filling is not very dry
you<00:02:15.660> can<00:02:15.720> even<00:02:15.990> add<00:02:16.200> a<00:02:16.230> sprinkling<00:02:16.740> of<00:02:16.980> flour

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
you can even add a sprinkling of flour

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.190 
you can even add a sprinkling of flour
on<00:02:17.550> top<00:02:17.790> of<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.120> filling<00:02:18.330> and<00:02:18.600> then<00:02:18.750> seal<00:02:19.050> it

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
on top of the filling and then seal it

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.500 
on top of the filling and then seal it
shut<00:02:19.230> so<00:02:19.920> that<00:02:20.070> the<00:02:20.220> flour<00:02:20.459> absorbs<00:02:20.850> any

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
shut so that the flour absorbs any

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:29.330 
shut so that the flour absorbs any
excess<00:02:21.959> moisture<00:02:22.140> in<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.890> paratha<00:02:26.810> and<00:02:28.340> take

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
excess moisture in the paratha and take

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.840 
excess moisture in the paratha and take
care<00:02:29.640> to<00:02:31.250> expand<00:02:32.250> it<00:02:32.340> along<00:02:32.670> the

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
care to expand it along the

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.430 
care to expand it along the
circumference<00:02:33.300> and<00:02:33.630> not<00:02:33.810> in<00:02:33.959> the<00:02:34.050> center

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
circumference and not in the center

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.320 
circumference and not in the center
because<00:02:34.920> if<00:02:35.160> you<00:02:35.250> thin<00:02:35.459> out<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.790> center<00:02:36.120> too

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
because if you thin out the center too

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:56.990 
because if you thin out the center too
much<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.750> edges<00:02:37.080> will<00:02:37.290> be<00:02:37.320> very<00:02:37.590> thick<00:02:55.850> so<00:02:56.850> now

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
much the edges will be very thick so now

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.300 
much the edges will be very thick so now
