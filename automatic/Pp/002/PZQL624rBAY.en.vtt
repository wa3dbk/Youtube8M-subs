 hello everyone happy to see you 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.019
 on the author tv during very missions 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.849
 daily devoted to the quinté plus 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.440
 and at 5.5 my guest of the day 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.700
 philippines newspaper bignon paris 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.220
 turf mongeon philippines jean philippe 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.529
 hello to all this Thursday direction lyon 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.359
 paris with the grand prix de paris a 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.359
 test for 4 year old horses it will be 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.640
 females and more over 2200 meters 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.189
 the summary we will attack by analysis 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.529
 cat +55 will follow the pronoun of our 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.500
 consultant without forgetting the advice of 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.630
 game we attack a philippines 5 5 with 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.579
 a favorite one will tell me everything indicated on 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.350
 number 7 strings very notes 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.340
 unhappy lately she is evolving 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.350
 in his garden we buy them 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.960
 absolutely yes we tear is everything to 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.710
 done is there the eighths last 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.570
 place but she was still 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.160
 better impression of the race so 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.290
 she could not find it her way 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.660
 there I think she's going to win 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.390
 her quinté sooner or later she is associated 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.640
 to cyril stéphane who knows her well and 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:05.120
 who said he had a lot 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:08.120
 liked his performance at Chantilly so the 6 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.830
 may be here for me she must be at 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.630
 less in the three cases me it's clear 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.550
 especially since it's still 3 wins 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.910
 4 to these sites in seven attempts on this 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.700
 trace 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:19.610
 it is true ie the sure blow but 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.869
 a hit location and in addition 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.640
 with the 6 in the stalls we go from one 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:23.780
 contrary we agree we will 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.000
 oppose the number 8 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.060
 go zou bras then it's the tandem 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.619
 fabre or water has just concluded 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.990
 third of a quinté reference 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.670
 good if Fabre continues in this way 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.200
 it's not for nothing yes yes otherwise it 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.759
 would have got rid of it a long time ago 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.890
 I think of them do not keep horses 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:43.300
 of handicap like that it is for 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.960
 to hang out of the 8th place of a heart 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.490
 yeah I think it's 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.580
 actually also a very good 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.840
 luck 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.730
 pierre-charles boudot think she can 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.260
 find your way in this kind of test 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:56.560
 and 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:59.680
 she likes the good ground so where has 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.870
 priori it will be good on this I think that 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.910
 it's not going to bother her at all 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.920
 progress on his third place in the 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.740
 race reference to chantilly it's 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.940
 certain so very very good luck me 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.550
 he can fight for the victory of yes 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.260
 well we keep it in 3d position so we 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.050
 know her well number two tools my 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.890
 beautiful to a correct comeback so is 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.960
 on the rising 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.250
 say it in the stalls the distance 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.890
 all done all the lights are green 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.430
 but she evoked the Quintetists the 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.430
 know very well 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:32.130
 she has she just done so a 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.390
 come back is not the agreement is that a 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.670
 times this year but 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.100
 his coach dreaded the ground too much 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.900
 flexible and I think that it will not be 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.110
 still not too much that will not pose a 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.540
 problem 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.010
 it 's mans who ran very well 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.810
 last year that was pretty 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.100
 regular in this test style so 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.430
 I think she can resume the course 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.320
 of her good outings and especially she 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.390
 is very very experienced so it's a 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.830
 asset in this type of water where it makes 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.710
 always a little waves where there is 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.810
 here is finally this session so much 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:06.120
 experience in this type of organic milk that 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.380
 we have crossed twitter oliver astor 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.030
 the phone and he was hot 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.600
 the coach in a thousand pitch that 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.780
 remained a doubt 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.290
 it was still there we will do them 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.540
 trust 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:19.470
 in fourth place a shot of poker 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.910
 the 14 must not lucha good it's a shot 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.860
 of poker that's so it's a small 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.920
 dedication to a friend who she 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.600
 will therefore recognize guapa uci a 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.900
 actually it's a big blow of 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.060
 poker 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.310
 good to know though that it's a 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:36.360
 filly of jean pierre gauvin who is 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:39.000
 from there so it's a new recruit 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.160
 she was bought to claim but she 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.410
 will be very interesting to have evolved to 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.310
 this level i think is there when we 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.920
 look at her music she is 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.030
 irreproachable 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.330
 three wins in four outings this 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.519
 year 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:54.120
 so certainly it was in small 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:55.680
 disabilities and in a claim but good 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.760
 she always won with a little bit of 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.019
 margin 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.379
 I think it can be a surprise 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:03.720
 and on his form and I trust 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:04.769
 for its bars it's not a big bag 5 on 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.790
 is at lyon parilly we are not at 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.519
 longchamp 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:12.720
 in my opinion she can climb the ladder 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:14.250
 without any problem ok in last 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.629
 position in fifth position then there 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.870
 that you did it on purpose for me 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:21.900
 number 3 all our guys here it's me 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:24.479
 this English is ok then we know it very 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.470
 felt good we could say loosening 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:27.270
 last time but not at all 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.949
 that she practically did not run there 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.199
 as we bought it in trust yes 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:32.940
 as often horses we see there are 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:34.289
 a perf like his bad who drags 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.410
 but actually actually do it once 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:39.510
 that they could express themselves 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:43.169
 so there to redeem totally 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:47.669
 I also think a hit in the five 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:48.750
 it's the same she could not 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:50.190
 to express oneself in the reference quinté 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.370
 of whipped cream so they are very 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.669
 many to meet tomorrow in Lyon 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.220
 1 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:58.530
 certainly she prefers the heavy she already has 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:01.110
 gained in soft ground and she has a 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:04.289
 perf in good ground so I think if 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.240
 yann durpaire persists as dense is to 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:08.460
 this level know that this is his second 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.760
 quinté only is that there must be 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:09.990
 believe 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.760
 good and then there he appealed to a 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.160
 pilot with maxime guyon so this is 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.639
 not for nothing to do the roof yes 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.710
 it's clear 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:18.120
 ok philippines i was asking for a small 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.520
 reminder of your selection is worth 8 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:24.300
 so then but eight so the set 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:28.080
 corinth of the clods on the 8th of alou 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:32.340
 ultima bella the 14th must not lucia the 3 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:34.680
 all our guys on the 15 falco lina lelas 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:37.349
 indian weary and the 11 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:39.810
 baky hockey regarding the game board 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:41.789
 we went on a 5 5 reduced fields 3 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:44.580
 shows three essential bases 7 8 2 

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:47.220
 we placed behind the ace on the 3rd the 5th on the 6th 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:49.260
 the 11th on the 14th and the 15th is a game that 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.190
 will cost 21 euros we can play at 50% or 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.630
 10% Peugeot 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:52.919
 it's an open race but we have 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.810
 even bass very very solid which I 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:56.669
 advise you to follow the selection of 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.060
 Filipinos in general they do not pass 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:05:59.430
 beside
