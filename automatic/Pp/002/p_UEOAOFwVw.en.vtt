00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
size of it you get an idea you can see

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.130 
size of it you get an idea you can see
the<00:02:56.530> bees<00:02:56.709> clustered<00:02:57.010> right<00:02:57.430> together<00:02:58.140> the

wasp there in on the same action but
this<00:03:50.000> is<00:03:50.180> forge<00:03:50.480> time<00:03:50.870> so<00:03:51.650> they're<00:03:51.799> much<00:03:52.069> more

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
this is forge time so they're much more

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.940 
interested in lapping up as much of this
goodness<00:03:55.040> and<00:03:55.329> my<00:03:56.329> experience<00:03:56.540> is<00:03:57.140> that<00:03:57.200> they

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
goodness and my experience is that they

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.339 
goodness and my experience is that they
will<00:03:58.129> totally<00:03:58.730> dry<00:03:58.970> it<00:03:59.030> out<00:03:59.239> when<00:04:00.200> they're

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:00.349 
will totally dry it out when they're

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:02.349 
will totally dry it out when they're
done<00:04:00.560> with<00:04:00.739> it<00:04:00.920> there<00:04:01.609> really<00:04:01.879> won't<00:04:02.150> be

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:02.359 
done with it there really won't be

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:04.899 
done with it there really won't be
anything<00:04:02.629> left<00:04:03.010> the<00:04:04.010> grass<00:04:04.250> will<00:04:04.489> just<00:04:04.700> fall
