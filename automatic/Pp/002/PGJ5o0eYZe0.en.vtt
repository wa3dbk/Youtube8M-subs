00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.550 
volleyball in this area here and then
you<00:00:21.000> remember<00:00:21.750> there's<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.080> bit<00:00:22.230> of<00:00:22.260> dirt<00:00:22.439> and

find<00:03:24.680> this<00:03:25.610> this<00:03:26.540> watch<00:03:28.360> it<00:03:29.360> was<00:03:29.510> hard<00:03:29.720> to<00:03:29.840> tell

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
find this this watch it was hard to tell

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.070 
find this this watch it was hard to tell
if<00:03:30.110> it<00:03:30.410> was<00:03:30.470> buried<00:03:31.459> or<00:03:31.700> if<00:03:31.880> it<00:03:32.000> was<00:03:32.120> on<00:03:32.239> top<00:03:32.570> I'm
