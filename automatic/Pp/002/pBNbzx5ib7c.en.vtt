00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 today the online store is heated in this 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.420
 you want to introduce you to the video review 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.790
 gainer from the company ultimatum 30 call 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.759
 muscle juice revolution 2600 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.440
 so who does not know the company Archimedes 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.379
 inside the tire is one of the advanced 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.460
 sports nutrition manufacturers 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:20.400
 makes quality sports supplements 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.769
 known in the overseas market very 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.930
 good and on our also in this video 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.000
 we have a taste of banana in this 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.060
 we have a bank of two point 12 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.550
 kilograms round two kilograms 200 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.390
 grams means at the same time one-dimensional 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.969
 portions is 4 dimensional cap 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.420
 approximately 200 65 grams 8 servings in this 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.730
 a can 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.410
 so I disagree a little bit with the size 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.719
 portions and further I will tell how about 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.450
 him taking means a jar looked like 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:52.079
 so characteristic of the company have 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.239
 Tim silence style is nothing superfluous 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.160
 Basically there is no go now 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.879
 the composition of the composition is presented in brief 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.370
 us for four-dimensional waters 235 grams on 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.760
 200 65 grams per serving we get 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:09.780
 1020 kilocalories 14 grams of fat 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:12.630
 means more than 56 grams of protein and 170 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.070
 grams of carbohydrates which is important sugar in 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.100
 the amount of 18 grams 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.680
 now farther in performance in 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.350
 everything is very good 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.360
 cool gamer is nothing extra a bit 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.939
 sugar normal carbohydrates in normal 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.799
 protein but serving size 265 grams 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.409
 frankly it's a very big size 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.180
 portions especially since the manufacturer is here 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.430
 on the contrary , he gave his recommendations 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.890
 recommends taking this gamer and 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.080
 dissolve any part with half a liter 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.520
 some water some water 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.170
 Well, I can say that if you dissolve 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.180
 half a liter of water is the amount of the 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.500
 get frank porridge so not 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.510
 should quibble a little bit of this 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.280
 recommend yourself a little diversify 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.220
 I would take for serving size approximately 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.890
 somewhere around 140 grams is approximately rhythm 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:59.360
 or 130 while you are this size 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:04.830
 servings get 603 kilocalories means 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:07.830
 get about for ko lang 20 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:10.160
 probably 8 grams of protein 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.410
 Well, this is a decent indicator and 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.920
 tentatively somewhere probably already 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.920
 order 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.890
 75-80 grams of excellent carbohydrates 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.470
 indicators it is even such 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.850
 i would say the low carb world which 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.860
 superior in performance 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:29.459
 initial proteins some some 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.110
 manufacturers by quality composition 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.060
 I want to say what the composition means with us 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.040
 also contains various bc 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.170
 amino acids 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.120
 Of course, their number per serving 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.830
 fairly minimal therefore should not 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.840
 treat this gamer as 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.550
 full replacement to be amino acids 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.260
 better of course to purchase by 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.470
 separately but as a nice bonus this 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.750
 cool as the manufacturer says 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.970
 composition is about the protein experience 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.709
 blend i.e. so called patent 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.160
 ravana I'm formula or will be simple 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:02.550
 language who about the composition that contain 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.200
 certain enzymes and taught 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.400
 filtered form of proteins which 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.360
 will be your body well 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:14.220
 assimilated and will not allow the body not 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:17.010
 digest a single drop the file is also in 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:20.940
 the composition contained in the soy milk 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.380
 egg protein sources and carbohydrates 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.350
 also contains various forms 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.060
 digestibility that will be absorbed 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.180
 by the body throughout me only 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.280
 short span 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.579
 throughout there do not know four hours 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.959
 after taking it to gamers means 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:36.879
 the producer also speak people on 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.689
 can be taken at night i am also with this 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:40.239
 I do not agree 

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:42.209
 so he wants from henry low-carb 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:44.260
 let's go so good in it a lot of protein 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.090
 Gainer I would recommend taking 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.280
 only this until seven o'clock in the evening 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.049
 why because of the composition after all 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.329
 contains sugar from still contain 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:55.180
 carbohydrates that can put off on your 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:57.099
 the body well, no one needs and 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.200
 fat layer so up to that 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:00.760
 avoid do not try try to 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.269
 seven o'clock in the evening that is, in the first 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.739
 half a day means by size portion 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:08.139
 said stick to serving 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:10.900
 about 130 140 grams but also 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:12.579
 converge with your body mass if 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.349
 it is rather small you can 100 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:16.750
 gram city ​​take if there is a kilogram 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:19.479
 city ​​tourist weigh if you are already there 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.549
 more than 80 kilograms take 140 160 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:24.099
 a gram of servings will be fine for you 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.720
 well dissolve itself in water or there 

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:26.139
 skimmed milk will be nice to him 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.330
 drink 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:30.270
 the effect will also get normal for example 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.770
 get about 25 30 grams of protein 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.810
 Now by reception time occur 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.000
 recommend the first portion to take 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:40.000
 right after sleep, like on a training day 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.729
 so on the rest day my recommendations 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.289
 manufacturers go second reception if 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:47.139
 Take a rest day at any time 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:49.960
 after lunch if you put on training 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:52.449
 somewhere 20 minutes after the end 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.010
 workouts can add what you can 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:56.349
 take a training day and three 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:59.520
 portions of the deprived and three portions of us on 

00:04:56.349 --> 00:05:01.780
 more optimal form of admission 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.030
 well- proven market 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.949
 gamers will perform positive reviews 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.020
 the only thing a little disappointed 

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:08.409
 This situation is a bit overpriced 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.479
 price 

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:12.310
 but what else did we want from the product from 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:14.790
 global manufacturer of good 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:17.040
 indicators for sawdust 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:19.830
 driven and fat which is really 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:22.050
 won the trust of many athletes around 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.810
 the world for quality as we know 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:26.150
 why buy here pay this gel 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:28.020
 you can in the online store 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:30.920
