page<00:01:02.559> done<00:01:02.980> in<00:01:03.250> pencil<00:01:04.560> first<00:01:05.560> I<00:01:05.950> start<00:01:06.909> out

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
page done in pencil first I start out

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.139 
page done in pencil first I start out
with<00:01:07.060> I<00:01:07.570> use<00:01:07.750> a<00:01:07.780> light<00:01:08.049> box<00:01:08.259> and<00:01:09.159> obviously

00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:10.149 
with I use a light box and obviously

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:11.010 
with I use a light box and obviously
this<00:01:10.360> is<00:01:10.540> sped<00:01:10.869> up

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
this is sped up

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.080 
this is sped up
I<00:01:11.140> don't<00:01:11.409> usually<00:01:11.619> draw<00:01:12.009> this<00:01:12.399> fast<00:01:12.700> but<00:01:13.060> I

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
I don't usually draw this fast but I

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.529 
I don't usually draw this fast but I
yeah<00:01:13.359> I<00:01:13.780> do<00:01:14.229> start<00:01:14.560> with<00:01:14.799> with<00:01:15.189> the<00:01:15.539> tracing

00:01:16.529 --> 00:01:16.539 
yeah I do start with with the tracing

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:20.129 
yeah I do start with with the tracing
the<00:01:16.689> the<00:01:17.109> borders<00:01:17.609> which<00:01:18.609> have<00:01:18.899> done<00:01:19.899> in<00:01:20.049> the

00:01:20.129 --> 00:01:20.139 
the the borders which have done in the

00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:22.529 
the the borders which have done in the
computer<00:01:20.530> it's<00:01:20.679> nice<00:01:20.950> and<00:01:21.159> easy<00:01:21.280> then<00:01:22.240> when<00:01:22.509> I

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:22.539 
computer it's nice and easy then when I

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:25.830 
computer it's nice and easy then when I
start<00:01:22.990> the<00:01:23.950> night<00:01:24.130> I<00:01:24.340> traced<00:01:25.240> the<00:01:25.389> the

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
start the night I traced the the

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.099 
start the night I traced the the
balloons<00:01:26.219> also<00:01:27.219> the<00:01:27.369> black<00:01:27.579> marker<00:01:28.079> then<00:01:29.079> I

00:01:29.099 --> 00:01:29.109 
balloons also the black marker then I

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:32.069 
balloons also the black marker then I
basically<00:01:29.409> start<00:01:30.100> tracing<00:01:30.939> my<00:01:31.359> characters

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:32.079 
basically start tracing my characters

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:34.139 
basically start tracing my characters
and<00:01:32.409> using<00:01:32.920> references<00:01:33.520> you<00:01:33.670> could<00:01:33.789> see<00:01:33.969> that

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149 
and using references you could see that

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:37.429 
and using references you could see that
there<00:01:34.779> was<00:01:34.840> an<00:01:35.170> iPad<00:01:35.799> there<00:01:36.100> with<00:01:36.249> a<00:01:36.359> chair

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
there was an iPad there with a chair

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.679 
there was an iPad there with a chair
that<00:01:38.439> I<00:01:38.529> used<00:01:38.799> I<00:01:39.069> start<00:01:39.969> tracing<00:01:40.240> my

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:40.689 
that I used I start tracing my

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:44.279 
that I used I start tracing my
characters<00:01:41.200> I<00:01:41.439> work<00:01:41.770> in<00:01:42.069> in<00:01:42.429> pencil

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:44.289 
characters I work in in pencil

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:46.980 
characters I work in in pencil
I<00:01:44.349> don't<00:01:45.219> erase<00:01:45.579> a<00:01:45.880> whole<00:01:46.119> lot<00:01:46.389> but<00:01:46.630> but<00:01:46.899> it

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
I don't erase a whole lot but but it

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.959 
I don't erase a whole lot but but it
gives<00:01:47.170> me<00:01:47.229> the<00:01:47.409> opportunity<00:01:47.649> as<00:01:48.490> you<00:01:48.639> can<00:01:48.759> see

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:48.969 
gives me the opportunity as you can see

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:51.629 
gives me the opportunity as you can see
I<00:01:48.999> also<00:01:49.329> sometimes<00:01:49.719> flip<00:01:50.319> the<00:01:50.560> board<00:01:50.770> and<00:01:51.130> and

00:01:51.629 --> 00:01:51.639 
I also sometimes flip the board and and

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:54.569 
I also sometimes flip the board and and
sketch<00:01:51.999> on<00:01:52.329> the<00:01:52.509> back<00:01:52.950> before<00:01:53.950> putting<00:01:54.490> it

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:54.579 
sketch on the back before putting it

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:57.359 
sketch on the back before putting it
back<00:01:54.759> over<00:01:55.090> my<00:01:55.539> my<00:01:56.049> artwork<00:01:56.499> and<00:01:56.709> it's<00:01:57.159> raised

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
back over my my artwork and it's raised

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:03.059 
back over my my artwork and it's raised
more<00:01:57.639> characters<00:01:58.329> like<00:01:58.569> that<00:02:01.079> yeah<00:02:02.079> I<00:02:02.259> tend<00:02:03.009> to

00:02:03.059 --> 00:02:03.069 
more characters like that yeah I tend to

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:05.700 
more characters like that yeah I tend to
adjust<00:02:03.549> quite<00:02:04.419> a<00:02:04.450> bit<00:02:04.779> and

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
adjust quite a bit and

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.480 
adjust quite a bit and
and<00:02:06.460> flip<00:02:07.030> the<00:02:07.270> board<00:02:07.450> quite<00:02:07.840> often<00:02:08.080> to<00:02:08.590> sketch

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 
and flip the board quite often to sketch

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.610 
and flip the board quite often to sketch
on<00:02:09.670> the<00:02:09.789> back<00:02:10.830> so<00:02:11.830> it's<00:02:12.100> not<00:02:12.310> it's<00:02:12.640> not<00:02:12.820> just

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
on the back so it's not it's not just

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.460 
on the back so it's not it's not just
tracing<00:02:14.620> whatever<00:02:15.160> whatever<00:02:15.790> it's<00:02:16.090> there<00:02:16.470> but

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
tracing whatever whatever it's there but

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.890 
tracing whatever whatever it's there but
I<00:02:17.530> do<00:02:17.590> start<00:02:18.070> out<00:02:18.250> with<00:02:18.520> with<00:02:18.850> all<00:02:19.120> my<00:02:19.450> my

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
I do start out with with all my my

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.140 
I do start out with with all my my
characters<00:02:20.410> I<00:02:20.530> have<00:02:20.560> a<00:02:20.680> loose<00:02:21.010> idea<00:02:21.670> of<00:02:21.940> where

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
characters I have a loose idea of where

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.940 
characters I have a loose idea of where
I<00:02:22.180> want<00:02:22.480> to<00:02:22.570> place<00:02:22.780> perspective<00:02:23.500> lines<00:02:23.709> and

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
I want to place perspective lines and

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.310 
I want to place perspective lines and
backgrounds<00:02:24.400> and<00:02:24.459> stuff<00:02:24.580> like<00:02:24.790> that

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
backgrounds and stuff like that

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.570 
backgrounds and stuff like that
sometimes<00:02:26.320> you<00:02:26.500> have<00:02:26.800> to<00:02:26.860> look<00:02:27.190> at<00:02:27.340> my<00:02:27.459> own

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
sometimes you have to look at my own

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.240 
sometimes you have to look at my own
reference<00:02:28.120> sketches<00:02:29.050> too<00:02:29.290> to<00:02:29.530> make<00:02:29.890> sure<00:02:30.040> the

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
reference sketches too to make sure the

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.930 
reference sketches too to make sure the
characters<00:02:30.640> look<00:02:30.910> like<00:02:31.770> like<00:02:32.770> the<00:02:32.980> they're

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
characters look like like the they're

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.790 
characters look like like the they're
supposed<00:02:34.270> to

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
supposed to

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.430 
supposed to
again<00:02:36.580> using<00:02:37.000> help<00:02:37.600> lines<00:02:37.870> on<00:02:38.140> the<00:02:38.260> back

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
again using help lines on the back

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.199 
again using help lines on the back
sometimes<00:02:39.840> that<00:02:40.840> can<00:02:40.959> help<00:02:41.940> it's<00:02:42.940> a<00:02:43.000> great

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
sometimes that can help it's a great
