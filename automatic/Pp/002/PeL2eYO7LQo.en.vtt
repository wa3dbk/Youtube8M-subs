the
now<00:00:54.100> we've<00:00:54.220> just<00:00:54.250> tapped<00:00:54.610> this<00:00:54.760> off<00:00:55.030> so<00:00:55.240> we've

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
now we've just tapped this off so we've

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.090 
now we've just tapped this off so we've
rehearsed<00:00:55.570> this<00:00:56.020> video<00:00:56.350> to<00:00:56.440> try<00:00:56.710> and<00:00:56.740> make<00:00:56.950> it

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100

rehearsed this video to try and make it
quicker<00:00:57.430> so<00:00:58.180> some<00:00:58.450> of<00:00:58.570> the<00:00:58.630> screws<00:00:58.960> aren't

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
quicker so some of the screws aren't

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.680 
quicker so some of the screws aren't
fully<00:00:59.620> in<00:00:59.860> right<00:01:00.640> so<00:01:00.820> there's<00:01:01.000> one<00:01:01.150> there<00:01:01.450> and

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
look at the screw just to see what

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.930 
look at the screw just to see what
they're<00:01:11.200> like<00:01:11.230> both<00:01:11.950> in<00:01:12.130> the<00:01:12.250> same<00:01:12.430> left<00:01:12.760> and

these<00:02:40.730> bolts<00:02:41.150> here<00:02:41.180> we<00:02:41.480> can<00:02:41.630> do<00:02:41.720> a<00:02:41.750> separate

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
these bolts here we can do a separate

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.820 
these bolts here we can do a separate
video<00:02:42.320> for<00:02:42.560> that<00:02:43.000> now<00:02:44.000> it's<00:02:44.210> more<00:02:44.420> just<00:02:44.830> look

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
video for that now it's more just look

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:55.360 
video for that now it's more just look
around<00:02:45.980> while<00:02:46.430> I<00:02:47.230> follow<00:02:48.230> these<00:02:49.330> nuts<00:02:50.330> off<00:02:54.370> he

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:18.450 
around while I follow these nuts off he
goes<00:02:55.670> try<00:02:56.510> not<00:02:56.780> to<00:02:56.810> drop<00:02:57.140> them<00:02:57.350> as<00:02:57.470> you<00:02:57.590> do<00:02:57.740> it

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:18.460 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:25.880 

this

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.970 

five<00:03:29.750> so<00:03:30.750> once<00:03:30.930> you<00:03:30.990> got<00:03:31.110> that<00:03:31.230> up<00:03:31.380> to<00:03:31.560> remember

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
five so once you got that up to remember

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.030 
five so once you got that up to remember
that<00:03:32.069> the<00:03:32.520> handle<00:03:32.880> is<00:03:33.000> then<00:03:33.380> sort<00:03:34.380> of<00:03:34.560> loose<00:03:34.770> or

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
that the handle is then sort of loose or

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.870 
that the handle is then sort of loose or
below<00:03:36.440> they<00:03:37.440> tend<00:03:37.740> not<00:03:37.830> to<00:03:37.980> move<00:03:38.340> too<00:03:38.670> much

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
below they tend not to move too much

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:39.949 
below they tend not to move too much
because<00:03:39.090> they've<00:03:39.300> got<00:03:39.420> the<00:03:39.510> studs<00:03:39.780> coming

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
because they've got the studs coming

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.860 
because they've got the studs coming
through<00:03:40.290> so<00:03:40.709> there's<00:03:40.890> the<00:03:41.040> six<00:03:41.570> there<00:03:42.570> we<00:03:42.750> go

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
through so there's the six there we go

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.600 
through so there's the six there we go
we've<00:03:43.050> got<00:03:43.230> those<00:03:43.410> out<00:03:43.680> there<00:03:43.920> and<00:03:44.220> the<00:03:44.370> two

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
screws so that's right now what we need

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.550 
screws so that's right now what we need
to<00:03:47.100> do<00:03:47.220> is<00:03:47.370> remove<00:03:47.730> this<00:03:48.060> connector<00:03:48.810> here<00:03:49.020> so
