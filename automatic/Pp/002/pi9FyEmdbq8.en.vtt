00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.350 
holding it with my left hand so then I'm
taking<00:01:34.140> from<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.619> left<00:01:34.860> from<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.729> back<00:01:36.000> and

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
taking from the left from the back and

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.420 
taking from the left from the back and
then<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.290> take<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:37.680> over<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.450> I<00:01:40.130> joined<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.280> to

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
then I take it over and I joined it to

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.130 
then I take it over and I joined it to
the<00:01:41.520> right<00:01:41.670> now<00:01:42.210> you<00:01:42.360> can<00:01:42.540> make<00:01:42.659> these<00:01:42.899> as

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
the right now you can make these as

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.950 
the right now you can make these as
thick<00:01:43.680> or<00:01:43.890> as<00:01:43.979> thin<00:01:44.189> as<00:01:44.549> you<00:01:44.820> want<00:01:45.240> piecewise

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
thick or as thin as you want piecewise

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.080 
thick or as thin as you want piecewise
i'll<00:01:46.380> probably<00:01:46.979> do<00:01:47.250> it<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.430> little<00:01:47.579> bit<00:01:47.700> thicker

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
i'll probably do it a little bit thicker

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.960 
i'll probably do it a little bit thicker
otherwise<00:01:48.960> we'll<00:01:49.320> be<00:01:49.350> here<00:01:49.500> all<00:01:49.740> day<00:01:49.860> right<00:01:50.369> so

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.620 

and<00:02:01.280> then<00:02:02.280> we<00:02:02.430> just<00:02:02.460> keep<00:02:02.790> right<00:02:03.030> on<00:02:03.060> doing<00:02:03.210> it
