 This training is in one 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:28.910
 Spanish-language school and there can 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.800
 that's too good for me because I'm the kids 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.050
 at homework in spanish 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.609
 So my lessons could help 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.280
 goals after training as 

00:00:34.609 --> 00:00:38.780
 social assistant is the education as 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.269
 then I want to start 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.999
 in any case work with children and that 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:46.999
 who also grow up bilingually 

00:00:43.999 --> 00:00:49.460
 I 'm from the party in Berlin 

00:00:46.999 --> 00:00:51.739
 grown up that I'm just depressed 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.249
 now after the training place too 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:53.989
 Find 

00:00:52.249 --> 00:00:57.139
 I would like to be in a kita 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:01:00.620
 work it is always said that no 

00:00:57.139 --> 00:01:03.949
 There are places but I know it too 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.630
 that it's the headscarf because women 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:08.659
 to work with a kerchief in the kita 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.570
 Sometimes it does not come across well 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:14.240
 actually a positive aspect for the 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.710
 Kitas would be good because I am good 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.840
 German good Turkish 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.009
 I would have had some simple knowledge 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.170
 just have to get to know each other 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:22.430
 i am from thailand and if it has been since 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.890
 twelve years here in germany 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.829
 I think by that I out 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:32.149
 In Thailand , I have more references 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:33.259
 on foreign children because the 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:35.659
 German children are a bit 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.609
 more and that me and the foreigners too 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:39.859
 to but you can, of course, the two 

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:42.439
 connect more with each other so small 

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:44.960
 children have already asked me so is 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:46.999
 did you paint your skin and have 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.070
 said no they are so it can be yes 

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:50.780
 touch or touch and then have 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.179
 she realized that it was not 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.840
 I was born in Cuba 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:58.909
 piÃ±eiro and I'm in 1990 to Germany 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.350
 my mother came to me that 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.170
 Remember that I am a nursing home here 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.180
 had worked 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.009
 A patient has said you bring 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.450
 he Schwarzkopf leaving any trouble 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:08.979
 had meant to her that safety 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.780
 can help she could know my 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.580
 names but not so I was for them 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.590
 has the head of the situation 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.260
 not born funny in berlin 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.569
 My mother is Pole and my father 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.630
 Macedonian the beautiful is my father 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.640
 my mother is christian and muslim 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.440
 that's why two religions clap 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.110
 and because of that too 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.540
 also several solid celebrated may 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.160
 I think it will always be 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.769
 problems and challenges with you 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.080
 bring as I look and with 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:41.720
 my cultural background we are 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:44.280
 These problems in this profession never 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.110
 Contrary to that we work in 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.860
 a social profession and people 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:52.230
 are not so superficial or 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.450
 pejorative to me and not 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.940
 our clientele I am from 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.320
 Hungary and I have been five and a half years 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.620
 years in berlin 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:04.170
 I also had these disadvantages 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.540
 Unfortunately , the people have noticed 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.220
 that she is an alien , well you can hear that 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.450
 a bit of the dialect maybe 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.750
 or as I speak 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.790
 and so and she said no, she wants 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.680
 I do not have and that was a bit 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.780
 so disappointed I already 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.760
 I had the advantages, for example 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.100
 at a client meter yesterday cake 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.610
 And she wanted Hungarian goulash 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.290
 try and i could give you that good 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.720
 cook and they were sell later 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.430
 Enthusiastically she hurriedly said if it was 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.020
 She would always like me 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.460
 while cooking while herbern 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:38.160
 I was born in Berlin and here 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:41.730
 my parents are raised from the 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.650
 Turkey almost 45 years ago 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.660
 germany immigrates already 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:49.790
 times certain ritual washings or 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:53.880
 on certain festive occasions the 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:55.650
 Others advise that be held 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.630
 if you know that better 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.370
 it just gets more accepted so 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.470
 his job with the future is going to be a lot 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.540
 wanted if you are competent if you 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.520

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.260
 shows that you want that you have a lot 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.560
 Good conditions for a job
