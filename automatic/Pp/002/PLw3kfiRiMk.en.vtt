so once the parts completed accounted to

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.820 
so once the parts completed accounted to
the<00:00:04.080> D<00:00:04.290> mold<00:00:04.560> section<00:00:05.040> to<00:00:05.430> be<00:00:05.609> demolded<00:00:06.830> we

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
the D mold section to be demolded we

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.040 
the D mold section to be demolded we
weigh<00:00:08.010> it<00:00:08.189> and<00:00:08.370> if<00:00:08.910> it<00:00:09.059> doesn't<00:00:09.420> meet<00:00:09.570> spec<00:00:09.900> at

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
weigh it and if it doesn't meet spec at

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.900 
weigh it and if it doesn't meet spec at
this<00:00:10.200> stage<00:00:10.440> it<00:00:10.650> goes<00:00:10.830> outside<00:00:11.099> to<00:00:11.460> be<00:00:11.580> crushed

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
this stage it goes outside to be crushed

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:21.080 
this stage it goes outside to be crushed
never<00:00:12.570> to<00:00:12.690> be<00:00:12.809> seen<00:00:13.019> in<00:00:13.170> Australian<00:00:13.590> waters

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.910 

luckily<00:00:21.720> this<00:00:22.109> has<00:00:22.260> only<00:00:22.410> happened<00:00:22.680> to

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
luckily this has only happened to

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.630 
luckily this has only happened to
handful<00:00:23.369> of<00:00:23.490> times<00:00:23.730> in<00:00:24.029> 25<00:00:24.509> years

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
handful of times in 25 years

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.249 
handful of times in 25 years
so<00:00:26.640> once<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.939> boats<00:00:27.150> out<00:00:27.330> of<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.509> mold<00:00:27.720> we

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:28.259 
so once the boats out of the mold we

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:31.249 
so once the boats out of the mold we
think<00:00:28.500> you<00:00:28.680> see<00:00:28.890> it<00:00:28.980> or<00:00:29.130> quality<00:00:29.550> control<00:00:30.259> once

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:31.259 
think you see it or quality control once

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:32.780 
think you see it or quality control once
it's<00:00:31.470> quality<00:00:31.800> controlled<00:00:32.220> it<00:00:32.460> then<00:00:32.579> goes<00:00:32.759> to

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
it's quality controlled it then goes to

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.569 
it's quality controlled it then goes to
the<00:00:33.030> grinding<00:00:33.420> base<00:00:33.949> sanded<00:00:34.949> and<00:00:35.040> painted<00:00:35.220> and

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
the grinding base sanded and painted and

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.509 
the grinding base sanded and painted and
then<00:00:35.820> it<00:00:35.910> joins<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.329> assembly<00:00:36.720> lines<00:00:37.400> so<00:00:38.400> as

00:00:38.509 --> 00:00:38.519 
then it joins the assembly lines so as

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:40.070 
then it joins the assembly lines so as
the<00:00:38.699> boat<00:00:38.910> moves<00:00:39.120> down<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.449> production<00:00:39.930> line

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:40.080 
the boat moves down the production line

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.079 
the boat moves down the production line
it<00:00:40.230> starts<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.680> take<00:00:40.860> on<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.070> familiar<00:00:41.280> shape

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:42.089 
it starts to take on a familiar shape

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:44.420 
it starts to take on a familiar shape
it's<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:42.989> hull<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.320> deck<00:00:43.410> adjoined<00:00:43.949> using<00:00:44.339> a

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
it's a hull and deck adjoined using a

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.090 
it's a hull and deck adjoined using a
product<00:00:44.640> called<00:00:44.820> Acme<00:00:45.329> bonds<00:00:45.739> when<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.829> Acme

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
product called Acme bonds when the Acme

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.369 
product called Acme bonds when the Acme
bond<00:00:47.309> is<00:00:47.489> applied<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:48.150> goes<00:00:48.480> off<00:00:48.690> very<00:00:48.989> quickly

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
bond is applied it goes off very quickly

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.119 
bond is applied it goes off very quickly
making<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.159> two<00:00:50.370> parts<00:00:50.760> become<00:00:51.120> one<00:00:52.129> in

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
making the two parts become one in

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.369 
making the two parts become one in
addition<00:00:53.460> we<00:00:54.239> fastened<00:00:54.690> both<00:00:54.839> parts<00:00:55.199> together

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
addition we fastened both parts together

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.590 
addition we fastened both parts together
then<00:00:55.920> apply<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.220> double<00:00:56.640> rubber<00:00:56.850> as<00:00:57.089> a<00:00:57.150> cosmetic

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
then apply a double rubber as a cosmetic

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.760

through<00:03:23.600> its<00:03:23.690> paces<00:03:24.250> we<00:03:25.250> test<00:03:25.550> it<00:03:25.730> so<00:03:26.030> you

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
through its paces we test it so you

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:41.590 
through its paces we test it so you
don't<00:03:26.420> have<00:03:26.570> to

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.420 

we<00:03:42.600> also<00:03:42.780> hooked<00:03:43.170> a<00:03:43.320> Suzuki<00:03:43.620> up<00:03:43.920> to<00:03:44.100> the<00:03:44.220> Suzuki

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
we also hooked a Suzuki up to the Suzuki

qualified technicians to access more

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.380 
qualified technicians to access more
than<00:03:48.870> 100<00:03:49.410> parameters<00:03:49.920> within<00:03:50.160> the<00:03:50.400> engine<00:03:50.760> it

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
than 100 parameters within the engine it

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:52.940 
than 100 parameters within the engine it
also<00:03:51.570> makes<00:03:51.990> sure<00:03:52.110> that<00:03:52.260> the<00:03:52.530> engine<00:03:52.680> is

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
also makes sure that the engine is

00:03:52.950 --> 00:04:05.130 
also makes sure that the engine is
running<00:03:52.980> correctly

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.450 

so<00:04:06.140> this<00:04:06.260> is<00:04:06.440> the<00:04:06.560> final<00:04:06.770> stage<00:04:07.130> of<00:04:07.280> production

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:07.460 
so this is the final stage of production

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.330 
so this is the final stage of production
this<00:04:08.120> is<00:04:08.240> where<00:04:08.360> the<00:04:08.450> boats<00:04:08.660> detailed<00:04:09.340> using

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
with little maintenance this boat will

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.720 
with little maintenance this boat will
say<00:04:15.890> looking<00:04:16.250> great

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730

so<00:04:21.400> the<00:04:21.519> boats<00:04:21.700> being<00:04:21.880> queue<00:04:22.120> seats<00:04:22.390> three

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
so the boats being queue seats three

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.840 
so the boats being queue seats three
times<00:04:22.870> during<00:04:23.200> production<00:04:23.500> and<00:04:23.950> then<00:04:24.520> again

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
times during production and then again

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.330 
times during production and then again
before<00:04:25.360> it<00:04:25.600> goes<00:04:25.750> onto<00:04:26.020> the<00:04:26.230> truck<00:04:26.500> to<00:04:27.040> come<00:04:27.220> to
