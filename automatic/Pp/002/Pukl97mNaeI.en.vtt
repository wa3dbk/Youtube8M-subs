00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
not confirmed but the source I got this

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.569 
not confirmed but the source I got this
information<00:00:30.630> from<00:00:31.050> says<00:00:31.619> that<00:00:31.890> it<00:00:32.070> was<00:00:32.279> leaked

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579

along with other information which

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.709 
along with other information which
turned<00:00:34.800> out<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:34.980> be<00:00:35.309> reliable<00:00:35.700> so<00:00:36.180> this<00:00:36.360> is<00:00:36.510> no

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
turned out to be reliable so this is no

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.840 
turned out to be reliable so this is no
guarantee<00:00:37.020> but<00:00:37.320> there's<00:00:37.829> always<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.370> slight

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
guarantee but there's always a slight

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.910 
guarantee but there's always a slight
possibility<00:00:39.090> that<00:00:39.870> these<00:00:40.050> weapons<00:00:40.500> could<00:00:40.739> be

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
possibility that these weapons could be

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.830 
possibility that these weapons could be
in<00:00:41.040> black<00:00:41.280> ops<00:00:41.520> 3<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:42.059> it's<00:00:42.420> always<00:00:42.570> fun<00:00:42.809> to

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
in black ops 3 and it's always fun to

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.270 
in black ops 3 and it's always fun to
talk<00:00:43.050> about<00:00:43.170> these<00:00:43.410> things<00:00:43.469> anyway<00:00:43.980> and

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
talk about these things anyway and

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.310 
talk about these things anyway and
supposedly<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.149> weapons<00:00:45.480> are<00:00:45.629> based<00:00:45.870> on<00:00:46.079> real

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
supposedly the weapons are based on real

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.139 
supposedly the weapons are based on real
life<00:00:46.530> where<00:00:46.770> more<00:00:47.039> expensive<00:00:47.550> weapons<00:00:47.940> have

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
life where more expensive weapons have

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.060 
life where more expensive weapons have
better<00:00:48.480> stats<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.200> camels<00:00:49.739> are<00:00:49.860> earned

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
better stats and camels are earned

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.220 
better stats and camels are earned
through<00:00:50.340> challenges<00:00:50.879> which<00:00:51.210> already<00:00:51.449> exists

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
through challenges which already exists

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.540 
through challenges which already exists
so<00:00:52.440> without<00:00:52.620> wasting<00:00:52.680> too<00:00:53.070> much<00:00:53.190> of<00:00:53.430> your<00:00:53.489> time

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550

weapon<00:02:55.810> so<00:02:55.989> much<00:02:56.200> probably<00:02:56.890> my<00:02:57.099> favorite

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
weapon so much probably my favorite

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.430 
weapon so much probably my favorite
weapon<00:02:57.790> of<00:02:57.909> all<00:02:58.060> time<00:02:58.329> but<00:02:58.540> like<00:02:58.629> i<00:02:58.780> said<00:02:58.810> this

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
weapon of all time but like i said this

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.559 
weapon of all time but like i said this
list<00:02:59.709> is<00:02:59.859> not<00:02:59.890> a<00:03:00.159> hundred<00:03:00.640> percent<00:03:00.790> confirmed

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
list is not a hundred percent confirmed

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:03.360 
list is not a hundred percent confirmed
but<00:03:02.049> i<00:03:02.079> personally<00:03:02.560> think<00:03:02.739> some<00:03:03.040> of<00:03:03.069> these<00:03:03.190> may

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
but i personally think some of these may

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.280 
but i personally think some of these may
actually<00:03:03.609> be<00:03:04.090> real<00:03:04.329> and<00:03:04.569> most<00:03:05.049> of<00:03:05.170> them

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
actually be real and most of them

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.559 
actually be real and most of them
probably<00:03:05.349> fake<00:03:06.099> but<00:03:06.370> it<00:03:06.549> does<00:03:06.790> make<00:03:07.000> sense<00:03:07.299> to

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
probably fake but it does make sense to

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:09.690 
probably fake but it does make sense to
bring<00:03:07.750> weapons<00:03:08.049> from<00:03:08.349> older<00:03:08.709> Cod's<00:03:09.010> because

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
bring weapons from older Cod's because

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.729 
bring weapons from older Cod's because
of<00:03:09.790> the<00:03:09.879> whole<00:03:10.030> concept<00:03:10.510> of<00:03:10.659> past<00:03:10.989> present<00:03:11.379> and

future theme that seems to be the
