all right this is how to program your

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.820 
all right this is how to program your
energy<00:00:10.650> bar<00:00:10.980> sound<00:00:11.969> bar<00:00:12.209> to<00:00:12.660> your<00:00:12.959> TV<00:00:13.320> remote

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
energy bar sound bar to your TV remote

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.780 
energy bar sound bar to your TV remote
and<00:00:14.089> if<00:00:15.089> you're<00:00:15.360> got<00:00:15.839> it<00:00:15.929> connected<00:00:16.320> this<00:00:16.500> way

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:16.790 
and if you're got it connected this way

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.120 
and if you're got it connected this way
or<00:00:17.790> this<00:00:18.210> optical<00:00:18.810> cable<00:00:19.200> is<00:00:19.320> coming<00:00:19.710> on<00:00:19.830> audio

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
or this optical cable is coming on audio

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.750 
or this optical cable is coming on audio
out<00:00:20.279> of<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.550> TV<00:00:20.840> so<00:00:21.840> basically<00:00:22.460> how<00:00:23.460> you<00:00:23.519> have

00:00:43.759 --> 00:00:43.769 
these little rubber pieces and then the

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:46.219 
these little rubber pieces and then the
switch<00:00:44.010> in<00:00:44.159> the<00:00:44.250> back<00:00:44.280> of<00:00:44.580> the<00:00:44.640> subwoofer<00:00:45.229> make
