00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
starting to cut into my whirlwind I

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.230 
starting to cut into my whirlwind I
don't<00:01:08.100> remember<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.520> exact<00:01:08.909> amount<00:01:09.210> of

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
don't remember the exact amount of

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.570 
don't remember the exact amount of
milliseconds<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.830> I've<00:01:11.159> got<00:01:11.310> somethin

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
milliseconds and I've got somethin

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.499 
milliseconds and I've got somethin
you're<00:01:11.700> just<00:01:11.729> havin<00:01:12.060> keeping<00:01:12.270> track<00:01:12.479> of

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:12.509 
you're just havin keeping track of

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:17.240 
you're just havin keeping track of
anyway<00:01:13.100> the<00:01:14.100> amount<00:01:14.399> of<00:01:14.430> milliseconds<00:01:16.250> where

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
anyway the amount of milliseconds where

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.800 
anyway the amount of milliseconds where
did<00:01:17.399> that<00:01:17.490> cutting<00:01:18.180> starts<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.539> interfere

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
did that cutting starts to interfere

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.050 
did that cutting starts to interfere
with<00:01:19.140> your<00:01:19.259> DBS<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.770> becomes<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.100> DBS<00:01:20.430> loss<00:01:20.700> all

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
with your DBS and becomes a DBS loss all

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.940 
with your DBS and becomes a DBS loss all
I<00:01:21.210> know<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:21.659> that<00:01:21.899> it<00:01:22.110> does<00:01:22.320> eventually<00:01:22.530> become

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
I know is that it does eventually become

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.859 
I know is that it does eventually become
a<00:01:22.979> DPS<00:01:23.369> loss<00:01:23.580> if<00:01:23.789> you<00:01:23.850> allow<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.299> keep<00:01:24.630> cutting

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
a DPS loss if you allow to keep cutting

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.810 
a DPS loss if you allow to keep cutting
so<00:01:25.439> all<00:01:25.590> I<00:01:25.619> do<00:01:25.740> is<00:01:25.979> just<00:01:26.009> when<00:01:26.369> it<00:01:26.460> starts<00:01:26.729> to

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
so all I do is just when it starts to

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.100 
so all I do is just when it starts to
get<00:01:26.939> really<00:01:27.240> close<00:01:27.509> it's<00:01:27.810> getting<00:01:28.020> pretty

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
get really close it's getting pretty

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.560 
get really close it's getting pretty
close<00:01:28.320> now<00:01:28.649> I'll<00:01:29.340> just<00:01:29.549> let<00:01:29.789> it<00:01:29.939> fall<00:01:30.119> off

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
close now I'll just let it fall off

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.880 
close now I'll just let it fall off
I<00:01:30.600> didn't<00:01:31.259> cast<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.649> bloodthirster<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.430> I<00:01:33.390> just
