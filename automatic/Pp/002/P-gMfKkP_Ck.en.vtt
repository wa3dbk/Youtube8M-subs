hi this is Wally Kern we're doing a
feeding<00:00:21.180> of<00:00:21.270> our<00:00:21.420> leopard<00:00:21.690> geckos<00:00:21.920> and<00:00:22.920> with

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:23.370 
feeding of our leopard geckos and with

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:24.920 
feeding of our leopard geckos and with
the<00:00:23.460> feeding<00:00:23.700> this<00:00:23.940> is<00:00:24.090> breeding<00:00:24.450> season<00:00:24.840> and

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
the feeding this is breeding season and

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.840 
the feeding this is breeding season and
we<00:00:25.050> noticed<00:00:25.410> that<00:00:25.470> one<00:00:25.800> of<00:00:25.920> our<00:00:26.040> pods<00:00:26.250> has<00:00:26.550> some

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:26.850 
we noticed that one of our pods has some

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.640 
we noticed that one of our pods has some
eggs<00:00:27.029> in<00:00:27.210> it<00:00:27.330> so<00:00:28.080> what<00:00:28.230> we're<00:00:28.380> going<00:00:28.529> to

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
eggs in it so what we're going to

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.500 
eggs in it so what we're going to
demonstrate<00:00:28.800> today<00:00:29.250> is<00:00:29.550> how<00:00:29.730> we<00:00:29.790> set<00:00:30.090> up<00:00:30.119> eggs

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
demonstrate today is how we set up eggs

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.110 
demonstrate today is how we set up eggs
to<00:00:30.750> be<00:00:30.869> incubated<00:00:31.860> and<00:00:32.309> hatched<00:00:32.550> out<00:00:32.790> here<00:00:33.030> at

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
to be incubated and hatched out here at

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.520 
to be incubated and hatched out here at

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
rat the end of the breeding season so it

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.390 
rat the end of the breeding season so it
looks<00:01:22.170> like<00:01:22.320> they<00:01:22.470> only<00:01:22.500> have<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.040> one<00:01:23.070> egg

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
looks like they only have the one egg

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.260 
looks like they only have the one egg
from<00:01:23.580> this<00:01:23.790> female<00:01:25.580> and<00:01:26.580> we're<00:01:26.760> preparing<00:01:27.120> the

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.160 
of the blanks in the in the supreme hash
material<00:01:46.310> we<00:01:47.310> put<00:01:47.550> the<00:01:47.640> top<00:01:47.820> back<00:01:47.850> on<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.420> deli

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
material we put the top back on the deli

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.760 
material we put the top back on the deli
cup<00:01:49.440> and<00:01:49.650> we've<00:01:49.770> labeled<00:01:50.010> the<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.910> top<00:01:51.770> with

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
cup and we've labeled the the top with

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.550 
cup and we've labeled the the top with
the<00:01:52.950> female's<00:01:53.580> name<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:54.150> the<00:01:55.140> collection

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
the female's name and the collection

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.859 
the female's name and the collection
date<00:01:55.740> that<00:01:56.729> way<00:01:56.820> we<00:01:56.970> can<00:01:57.090> watch<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.510> egg<00:01:57.630> to

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
date that way we can watch the egg to

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.630 
date that way we can watch the egg to
determine<00:01:58.290> when<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.100> hatches

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
determine when it hatches

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.100 
determine when it hatches
okay<00:01:59.910> we're<00:02:00.060> adding<00:02:00.330> the<00:02:00.420> eggs<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.930> the

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
okay we're adding the eggs to the

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.230 
okay we're adding the eggs to the
incubator<00:02:01.650> I<00:02:01.740> have<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.040> incubator<00:02:02.400> set<00:02:02.670> at<00:02:02.790> 82

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
incubator I have the incubator set at 82

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.800 
incubator I have the incubator set at 82
degrees<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:04.280> that's<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.520> get<00:02:06.150> more<00:02:06.420> females

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
degrees and that's to get more females

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.400 
degrees and that's to get more females
than<00:02:07.110> males<00:02:07.520> we<00:02:08.520> can<00:02:08.810> determine<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:10.020> sex<00:02:10.260> of

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
than males we can determine the sex of

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.620 
than males we can determine the sex of
the<00:02:10.470> leopard<00:02:11.070> gecko's<00:02:11.370> by<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:12.150> temperature

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
the leopard gecko's by the temperature

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.340 
the leopard gecko's by the temperature
of<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.870> incubator<00:02:13.820> anything<00:02:14.820> under<00:02:15.140> 83<00:02:16.140> or<00:02:16.260> 84

of the incubator anything under 83 or 84

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.410 
of the incubator anything under 83 or 84
degrees<00:02:16.800> should<00:02:17.190> give<00:02:17.400> us<00:02:17.520> more<00:02:17.760> females<00:02:18.180> than

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
degrees should give us more females than

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.410 
degrees should give us more females than
males<00:02:18.450> and<00:02:19.250> anything<00:02:20.250> over<00:02:20.459> 85<00:02:20.910> should<00:02:21.240> give

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
males and anything over 85 should give

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.830 
males and anything over 85 should give
us<00:02:21.540> more<00:02:21.750> males<00:02:22.230> than<00:02:22.410> females<00:02:23.600> the<00:02:24.600> eggs<00:02:24.720> will

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
us more males than females the eggs will

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.350 
us more males than females the eggs will
sit<00:02:25.019> here<00:02:25.170> for<00:02:25.380> about<00:02:25.530> two<00:02:25.830> months<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:26.360> will

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
sit here for about two months and will

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.020 
sit here for about two months and will
constantly<00:02:27.810> watch<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.920> eggs<00:02:29.190> and<00:02:29.670> make
