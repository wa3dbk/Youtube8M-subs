if you look outside you wouldn't think

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.529 
if you look outside you wouldn't think
that<00:00:50.309> we've<00:00:50.489> got<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.670> big<00:00:50.850> storm<00:00:51.090> coming<00:00:51.270> our

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
that we've got a big storm coming our

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.090 
that we've got a big storm coming our
way<00:00:51.719> but<00:00:51.780> we've<00:00:52.199> been<00:00:52.350> watching<00:00:52.500> this<00:00:52.770> one<00:00:52.920> for

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
way but we've been watching this one for

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.260 
way but we've been watching this one for
a<00:00:53.129> little<00:00:53.250> while<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.760> looks<00:00:53.969> like<00:00:54.090> it<00:00:54.239> is

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
a little while and it looks like it is

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.090 
a little while and it looks like it is
getting<00:00:54.570> closer<00:00:54.870> so<00:00:55.469> there's<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.680> chance<00:00:55.710> of

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
getting closer so there's a chance of

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.290 
getting closer so there's a chance of
snow<00:00:56.190> in<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.520> forecast<00:00:56.699> even<00:00:57.239> the

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
snow in the forecast even the

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.000 
snow in the forecast even the
possibility<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.899> some<00:00:58.199> ice<00:00:58.379> which<00:00:58.800> would

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
possibility of some ice which would

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.619 
possibility of some ice which would
actually<00:00:59.489> be<00:00:59.579> much<00:00:59.760> worse<00:01:00.030> than<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.420> snow

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
actually be much worse than the snow

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.270 
actually be much worse than the snow
will<00:01:01.320> take<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.500> look<00:01:01.710> at<00:01:01.770> that<00:01:01.890> right<00:01:02.039> now<00:01:02.160> let

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280

does<00:01:33.180> look<00:01:33.360> like<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.780> timing<00:01:34.290> is<00:01:34.500> gonna<00:01:34.710> be

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
does look like the timing is gonna be

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.440 
does look like the timing is gonna be
kind<00:01:35.310> of<00:01:35.369> critical<00:01:35.670> about<00:01:35.820> whether<00:01:36.180> or<00:01:36.270> not<00:01:36.329> we

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
kind of critical about whether or not we

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.170 
kind of critical about whether or not we
get<00:01:36.600> any<00:01:36.780> warmer<00:01:37.770> air<00:01:37.950> in<00:01:38.189> here<00:01:38.369> yeah<00:01:38.640> I<00:01:39.000> tell

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
yesterday the storm track has shifted

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.630 
yesterday the storm track has shifted
yesterday<00:01:49.200> it<00:01:49.680> looked<00:01:49.710> like<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.159> heavy<00:01:50.310> snow

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
yesterday it looked like the heavy snow

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.010 
yesterday it looked like the heavy snow
band<00:01:50.820> may<00:01:51.030> go<00:01:51.180> south<00:01:51.420> this<00:01:51.600> thing's<00:01:51.780> kind<00:01:51.960> of

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
band may go south this thing's kind of

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.420 
band may go south this thing's kind of
been<00:01:52.110> going<00:01:52.290> back<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.530> forth<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:53.040> last<00:01:53.220> few

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
been going back and forth the last few

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.460 
been going back and forth the last few
days<00:01:53.610> current<00:01:54.360> indications<00:01:54.570> are<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.290> heavy

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
days current indications are the heavy

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.200 
days current indications are the heavy
snow<00:01:55.799> band<00:01:56.009> will<00:01:56.250> go<00:01:56.369> across<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.670> northern

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
snow band will go across the northern

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.330 
snow band will go across the northern
two-thirds<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:57.780> Kentucky<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:58.439> extreme

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
two-thirds of Kentucky and extreme

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.399 
two-thirds of Kentucky and extreme
southern<00:01:59.850> Indiana<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.780> as<00:02:01.170> Craig<00:02:01.380> mentioned

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
southern Indiana and as Craig mentioned

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.679 
southern Indiana and as Craig mentioned
a<00:02:01.920> possible<00:02:02.130> ice<00:02:02.610> storm<00:02:03.060> across

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
a possible ice storm across

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.510 
a possible ice storm across
south-central<00:02:04.079> southeast<00:02:05.009> Kentucky

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
south-central southeast Kentucky

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.719 
south-central southeast Kentucky
heaviest<00:02:06.180> snow<00:02:06.420> band<00:02:06.689> up<00:02:06.869> to<00:02:07.079> eight<00:02:07.259> inches

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
heaviest snow band up to eight inches

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.249 
heaviest snow band up to eight inches
could<00:02:08.729> be<00:02:08.910> either<00:02:09.149> here<00:02:09.660> in<00:02:09.690> Louisville<00:02:10.140> or

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
could be either here in Louisville or

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.390 
could be either here in Louisville or
just<00:02:10.649> stew<00:02:11.129> our<00:02:11.280> south<00:02:11.700> again

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
just stew our south again

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.460 
just stew our south again
so<00:02:12.579> 24<00:02:13.540> hours<00:02:13.689> ahead<00:02:13.810> of<00:02:13.900> time<00:02:14.079> it's<00:02:14.260> kind<00:02:14.409> of

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
so 24 hours ahead of time it's kind of

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.350 
so 24 hours ahead of time it's kind of
hard<00:02:14.709> to<00:02:14.769> tell<00:02:15.040> and<00:02:15.340> then<00:02:15.670> three<00:02:16.090> is<00:02:16.209> six

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
hard to tell and then three is six

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.880 
hard to tell and then three is six
inches<00:02:16.540> across<00:02:16.900> southern<00:02:17.319> Indiana<00:02:17.650> but<00:02:17.769> we

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
inches across southern Indiana but we

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.259 
inches across southern Indiana but we
should<00:02:18.069> get<00:02:18.189> at<00:02:18.280> least<00:02:18.310> four<00:02:18.640> inches<00:02:18.700> of<00:02:19.060> snow

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269 
should get at least four inches of snow

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:20.580 
should get at least four inches of snow
here<00:02:19.510> in<00:02:19.810> the<00:02:19.989> Louisville<00:02:20.260> area<00:02:20.349> and<00:02:20.530> of

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
here in the Louisville area and of

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.050 
here in the Louisville area and of
course<00:02:20.739> prego<00:02:21.159> we<00:02:21.310> do<00:02:21.430> want<00:02:21.579> to<00:02:21.640> mention<00:02:21.760> that

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
course prego we do want to mention that

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.940 
course prego we do want to mention that
the<00:02:22.480> storm<00:02:22.780> system<00:02:23.110> is<00:02:23.200> still<00:02:23.409> way<00:02:23.620> down<00:02:23.650> in

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
the storm system is still way down in

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.670 
the storm system is still way down in
Mexico<00:02:24.599> plenty<00:02:25.599> of<00:02:25.689> time<00:02:25.870> for<00:02:26.079> it<00:02:26.140> to<00:02:26.170> get<00:02:26.349> here

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
Mexico plenty of time for it to get here

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.920 
Mexico plenty of time for it to get here
so<00:02:26.739> we're<00:02:27.370> going<00:02:27.579> to<00:02:27.790> fine-tune<00:02:28.329> the<00:02:28.480> forecast

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
so we're going to fine-tune the forecast

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.750 
so we're going to fine-tune the forecast
plenty<00:02:29.200> of<00:02:29.379> time<00:02:29.500> to<00:02:29.590> do<00:02:29.709> that<00:02:29.890> as<00:02:30.099> the<00:02:30.519> storm

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
plenty of time to do that as the storm

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.520 
plenty of time to do that as the storm
approaches<00:02:31.239> exactly<00:02:31.930> you<00:02:32.019> know<00:02:32.140> that<00:02:32.349> the

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
approaches exactly you know that the

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.020 
approaches exactly you know that the
further<00:02:32.769> away<00:02:32.950> it<00:02:33.099> is<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:33.430> less<00:02:33.549> confidence

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
further away it is the less confidence

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.339 
further away it is the less confidence
we<00:02:34.150> haven't<00:02:34.420> exactly<00:02:34.689> where<00:02:34.989> this<00:02:35.140> thing<00:02:35.290> is

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
we haven't exactly where this thing is

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:36.569 
we haven't exactly where this thing is
going<00:02:35.409> to<00:02:35.590> go<00:02:35.709> so<00:02:35.920> we'll<00:02:36.010> be<00:02:36.129> watching<00:02:36.489> it

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:36.579 
going to go so we'll be watching it

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:37.949 
going to go so we'll be watching it
rather<00:02:36.730> closely<00:02:37.000> over<00:02:37.209> the<00:02:37.359> next<00:02:37.450> 24<00:02:37.930> hours

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
rather closely over the next 24 hours

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:39.869 
rather closely over the next 24 hours
see<00:02:38.739> what's<00:02:38.950> going<00:02:39.129> to<00:02:39.189> happen<00:02:39.489> but<00:02:39.609> you<00:02:39.790> know

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:39.879 
see what's going to happen but you know

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:41.009 
see what's going to happen but you know
there's<00:02:40.090> still<00:02:40.180> the<00:02:40.359> possibility<00:02:40.480> we<00:02:40.930> could

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
there's still the possibility we could

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:42.300 
there's still the possibility we could
get<00:02:41.109> some<00:02:41.290> that<00:02:41.409> Gulf<00:02:41.620> moisture<00:02:41.799> in<00:02:42.069> here<00:02:42.099> and

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
get some that Gulf moisture in here and

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.220 
get some that Gulf moisture in here and
warm<00:02:42.790> things<00:02:43.000> up<00:02:43.150> a<00:02:43.239> little<00:02:43.359> bit<00:02:43.450> yeah<00:02:43.780> if<00:02:43.989> we

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
warm things up a little bit yeah if we

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.170 
warm things up a little bit yeah if we
get<00:02:44.440> a<00:02:44.739> little<00:02:45.010> more<00:02:45.069> freezing<00:02:45.430> rain<00:02:45.790> or<00:02:45.970> sleet

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
get a little more freezing rain or sleet

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.849 
get a little more freezing rain or sleet
which<00:02:46.569> right<00:02:46.780> now<00:02:46.810> I<00:02:46.959> think<00:02:47.049> we'll<00:02:47.379> stay<00:02:47.620> south

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:47.859 
which right now I think we'll stay south

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:49.349 
which right now I think we'll stay south
of<00:02:48.069> us<00:02:48.190> but<00:02:48.340> that<00:02:48.519> gets<00:02:48.639> in<00:02:48.819> here<00:02:49.000> that<00:02:49.180> would

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:49.359 
of us but that gets in here that would

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:50.610 
of us but that gets in here that would
drop<00:02:49.599> the<00:02:49.659> snow<00:02:49.959> to<00:02:50.019> what<00:02:50.170> levels<00:02:50.470> a<00:02:50.590> little

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
drop the snow to what levels a little

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.860 
drop the snow to what levels a little
bit<00:02:50.980> but<00:02:51.400> either<00:02:51.609> way<00:02:51.849> looks<00:02:52.269> like<00:02:52.480> bad

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
bit but either way looks like bad

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.930 
bit but either way looks like bad
driving<00:02:53.170> conditions<00:02:53.739> coming<00:02:54.340> in<00:02:54.489> for

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
driving conditions coming in for

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.099 
driving conditions coming in for
tomorrow<00:02:55.180> night<00:02:55.329> and<00:02:55.480> Thursday<00:02:55.750> all<00:02:55.959> right

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.109 
tomorrow night and Thursday all right
