able to shoot at the same time but from
different<00:00:23.220> angles<00:00:23.699> if<00:00:23.970> you<00:00:24.510> think<00:00:24.689> about<00:00:24.810> it

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
different angles if you think about it

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.689 
different angles if you think about it
there<00:00:25.439> are<00:00:25.470> actually<00:00:25.830> two<00:00:26.010> sets<00:00:26.250> of<00:00:26.369> 90

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
there are actually two sets of 90

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.550 
there are actually two sets of 90
degrees<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.210> two<00:00:27.390> sets<00:00:27.570> of<00:00:27.660> 120<00:00:28.080> degrees<00:00:28.380> at

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
degrees and two sets of 120 degrees at

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.560 
degrees and two sets of 120 degrees at
any<00:00:28.710> time<00:00:28.980> so<00:00:29.640> if<00:00:29.699> we<00:00:29.789> go<00:00:29.880> light<00:00:30.150> source<00:00:30.420> to

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
any time so if we go light source to

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.060 
any time so if we go light source to
subject<00:00:30.960> drawing<00:00:31.289> those<00:00:31.470> two<00:00:31.650> imaginary

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
subject drawing those two imaginary

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.160 
subject drawing those two imaginary
strings<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.730> subject<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.660> photographer

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
strings and subject to a photographer

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.959 
strings and subject to a photographer
there's<00:00:34.770> actually<00:00:35.130> a<00:00:35.160> 90<00:00:35.430> degree<00:00:35.520> straight

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
there's actually a 90 degree straight

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.700 
there's actually a 90 degree straight
off<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.329> left<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:36.899> straight<00:00:36.930> off<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.620> the

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
off to the left and straight off to the

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.650 
off to the left and straight off to the
right<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.520> same<00:00:38.670> is<00:00:38.790> true<00:00:38.820> for<00:00:38.969> our<00:00:39.210> 120

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
right and the same is true for our 120

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.200 
right and the same is true for our 120
so<00:00:40.379> we<00:00:40.530> can<00:00:40.649> be<00:00:40.739> shooting<00:00:41.070> from<00:00:41.760> opposite

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
so we can be shooting from opposite

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.389 
so we can be shooting from opposite
sides<00:00:42.360> of<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.719> action<00:00:43.469> getting<00:00:44.190> great<00:00:44.370> shots

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
sides of the action getting great shots

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.279 
sides of the action getting great shots
and<00:00:44.850> both<00:00:45.090> of<00:00:45.120> us<00:00:45.360> still<00:00:45.660> at<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.930> same<00:00:46.110> time

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
and both of us still at the same time

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.160 
and both of us still at the same time
