fast<00:00:39.840> mag<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.680> i<00:00:41.340> think<00:00:41.610> i<00:00:41.700> had<00:00:41.910> the

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
fast mag and i think i had the

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.580 
fast mag and i think i had the
lightweight<00:00:43.640> toughness<00:00:44.640> scavenger<00:00:45.300> and

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590

channel<00:01:19.020> it's<00:01:19.350> grown<00:01:19.770> immensely<00:01:20.159> over<00:01:20.909> the

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
channel it's grown immensely over the

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.390 
channel it's grown immensely over the
last<00:01:21.150> war<00:01:21.630> mount<00:01:21.930> for<00:01:22.200> so<00:01:22.350> i<00:01:22.560> think<00:01:23.040> it's<00:01:23.280> like

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
last war mount for so i think it's like

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.609 
last war mount for so i think it's like
grown<00:01:23.850> extremely<00:01:24.390> extremely<00:01:24.990> quick<00:01:25.320> from<00:01:25.560> the

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
grown extremely extremely quick from the

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.620 
grown extremely extremely quick from the
video<00:01:26.220> that<00:01:26.610> was<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.939> triple<00:01:27.240> nucular<00:01:27.420> and

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
video that was the triple nucular and

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.960 
video that was the triple nucular and
slums<00:01:27.869> I<00:01:28.110> think<00:01:29.070> they<00:01:29.189> gained<00:01:29.340> from<00:01:29.490> outsource

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
slums I think they gained from outsource

them I mean I don't know why people have
such<00:03:04.740> a<00:03:04.770> big<00:03:04.950> problem<00:03:05.100> with<00:03:05.280> them<00:03:05.460> but<00:03:05.580> you

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
such a big problem with them but you

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.790 
such a big problem with them but you
know<00:03:05.850> it<00:03:06.420> it's<00:03:06.960> one<00:03:07.080> of<00:03:07.170> the<00:03:07.230> things<00:03:07.260> I<00:03:07.740> think

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
know it it's one of the things I think

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.200 
know it it's one of the things I think
people<00:03:08.070> people<00:03:08.460> used<00:03:08.700> to<00:03:08.730> use<00:03:08.820> them<00:03:09.030> quite<00:03:09.150> a

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.210 
people people used to use them quite a

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:10.370 
people people used to use them quite a
bit<00:03:09.270> modern<00:03:09.540> warfare<00:03:09.720> free<00:03:10.020> but<00:03:10.200> I<00:03:10.230> don't

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
bit modern warfare free but I don't

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:11.660 
bit modern warfare free but I don't
think<00:03:10.440> they<00:03:10.590> really<00:03:11.100> used<00:03:11.310> to<00:03:11.370> be<00:03:11.430> talked

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
think they really used to be talked

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.520 
think they really used to be talked
about<00:03:11.760> modern<00:03:12.150> warfare<00:03:12.300> 4<00:03:12.450> I<00:03:12.810> can't<00:03:13.320> ask<00:03:13.440> you

know<00:03:48.150> you<00:03:48.420> can<00:03:48.510> get<00:03:48.600> good<00:03:48.720> KD<00:03:48.959> out<00:03:49.140> of<00:03:49.260> it<00:03:49.380> and

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
know you can get good KD out of it and

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.830 
know you can get good KD out of it and
Google<00:03:49.770> score<00:03:49.950> per<00:03:50.040> minute<00:03:50.280> if<00:03:50.910> your<00:03:51.240> average

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
Google score per minute if your average

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.030 
Google score per minute if your average
then<00:03:52.110> you<00:03:52.170> can<00:03:52.260> get<00:03:52.350> a<00:03:52.410> good<00:03:52.500> score<00:03:52.620> per<00:03:52.800> minute

then you can get a good score per minute

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.449 
then you can get a good score per minute
and<00:03:53.130> a<00:03:53.220> decent<00:03:53.730> KD<00:03:54.180> suppose<00:03:54.540> though<00:03:55.310> just<00:03:56.310> bear

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
and a decent KD suppose though just bear

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:57.590 
and a decent KD suppose though just bear
in<00:03:56.580> mind<00:03:56.610> that<00:03:56.850> when<00:03:57.030> you're<00:03:57.180> calling<00:03:57.450> your

kill streaks and if you die then the

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:01.940 
kill streaks and if you die then the

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
assist score doesn't count which I don't

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.380

it so that when you die still get Cisco

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.290 
it so that when you die still get Cisco
cuz<00:04:07.350> that'd<00:04:07.470> be<00:04:07.560> pretty<00:04:07.680> good<00:04:08.000> it's<00:04:09.000> bit<00:04:09.180> of<00:04:09.240> a
