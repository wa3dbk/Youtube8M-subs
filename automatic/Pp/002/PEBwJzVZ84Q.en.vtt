00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.720
 commenting and we are here in a new 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.810
 video of minecraft and this time 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.270
 we are again in the 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:31.869
 1.8 roll-up update for 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:34.480
 do not enter for the xbox and well let's 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:36.640
 see how pumpkins grow a little 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:40.770
 and what would melons be here already 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.770
 I have in my water pocket in infinite 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.079
 and good 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.940
 first we are not going to pick up water 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.350
 we have our voice here and well let's 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.649
 do this that makes a habit 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:57.260
 and here is going to be another perfect inside 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:58.040
 let's fill with water ok 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.400
 perfect 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.830
 well what follows is on the sides 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.770
 let's elaborate the land and let's 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:09.940
 plant on this side seeds of 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.940
 pumpkin and 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.190
 now with the bone meat what 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.560
 we will do is to grow that is the most 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.750
 difficult in this case if you do not have meat 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.890
 of bone because it is what takes the longest 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.710
 do not despair if it takes 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:26.160
 quite in what follows is that we're going to 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.680
 achieve forgiveness for all the land that 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:33.030
 stay around here because right now they're going 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:36.240
 to see how they grow perfect and there it is already 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:40.140
 a pumpkin grew every time it leaves the 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.710
 stalk and sticks so to speak and 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.350
 good simply and simply to the lack 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.119
 cut it and ready nothing will happen try 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.540
 in these crops are quite easy 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.540
 of doing 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.159
 around here in chew do not want me 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.490
 Perfect we are going to leave to see if 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.250
 grow up 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:04.430
 good carnal let's see if they grow or 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:07.340
 good comrades and as you see here they were 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.259
 a little bit like a turtle, so 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.580
 then bore so well I see them 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.580
 when I grow up 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.140
 and good calm times once more and 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:21.380
 we are here and as you see, the 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:24.080
 pumpkin already the melon grew all well and 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:27.440
 good as you see what happens is that the 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:30.230
 stem sticks to that little thing and do not pass 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.180
 nothing more simply so let's give 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.650
 leave the game to see how it 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.470
 collects because very creative if what 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.900
 we collect will not give us anything then 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.230
 let's try it in what would be the mode 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.930
 of carnal survival 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.760
 perfect 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:50.340
 how come to victoria tam airlines 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.340
 survival charge to accept 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:59.150
 well here we are and as you can see we are going to 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:02.870
 cut the zucchini leaves us 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.610
 obviously a pumpkin is worth stupid 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.430
 what I just said here is our 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:10.900
 squash come let's cut the other 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:13.400
 pumpkin that is perfectly fine 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.080
 look how they look are perfectly fine 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.870
 and now the most interesting part of 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.430
 these crops is that they do not need to 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.100
 do nothing else just go back to 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.680
 revalue the earth and ready and here my 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:28.190
 favorite part the melons already gave us 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.860
 seven melons this thing or watermelons like 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.800
 the point is that it's food and they see 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.050
 pretty pretty good 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:38.080
