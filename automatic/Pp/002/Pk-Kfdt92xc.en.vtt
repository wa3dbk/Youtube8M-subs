three<00:01:12.000> so<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.600> know<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:12.900> rotate<00:01:13.500> host<00:01:13.770> so

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
three so you know you rotate host so

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.039 
three so you know you rotate host so
it's<00:01:14.310> like<00:01:14.460> even<00:01:14.939> in<00:01:15.090> there<00:01:15.630> isn't<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.869> big

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
it's like even in there isn't a big

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.570

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
disadvantage to know what happened was

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.060 
disadvantage to know what happened was
we<00:01:18.180> rotated<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.780> host<00:01:19.020> but<00:01:19.320> they<00:01:19.710> all<00:01:19.860> just

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
we rotated a host but they all just

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.770 
we rotated a host but they all just

less<00:01:39.060> retarded<00:01:39.600> plus<00:01:40.049> our<00:01:40.979> host<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.520> on<00:01:41.640> the

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
less retarded plus our host is on the

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.340 
less retarded plus our host is on the
west<00:01:41.939> coast<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.390> their<00:01:42.600> hosts<00:01:42.899> on<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.140> east

so the chances of finding them is so

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.469 
so the chances of finding them is so
tiny<00:01:46.320> but<00:01:46.619> i<00:01:47.369> guess<00:01:47.670> like<00:01:47.700> we're<00:01:48.240> all<00:01:48.299> really
