00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:01.969
 I am friends 

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:05.129
 what in two three and today I come to talk about country 12 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.169
 let's not start 

00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:12.469
 In the United States during the 1980s, a series of 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:15.699
 murders that the police never managed to explain 

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:19.919
 the most brutal killing of all happened in a house where five died 

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:24.269
 people in an inhuman way and two others were seriously injured 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.380
 on the wall you could read two letters written in blood 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.510
 the police interrogated the survivors to try to find out 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:34.230
 what had happened 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.900
 one of the wounded before dying said he had been attacked by a 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.350
 bear with eyes of fire that was covered in blood and that did not stop 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:42.250
 skip 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.240
 the only survivor suffered hallucinations and nightmares during the 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.770
 rest of his life 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.780
 the media devoted a large space to their television news 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.330
 to this bloodthirsty murderer which increased his popularity by killing and 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.489
 signing the walls with the letters td written with the blood of their victims 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.320
 the people of the city slept every night afraid 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.159
 the murders happened and nobody managed to catch the author of the killings 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.420
 one more night 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.520
 a couple of officers managed to spot a strange figure in the shadows 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.550
 writing the letters teve on the wall of a dark alley during shift 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:20.470
 routine 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.180
 they did not hesitate to pounce on the suspect 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.880
 but he noticed and ran away 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.400
 the police asked for reinforcements and managed to follow him to a cemetery 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.380
 close thanks to the trail of blood that the killer left behind 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.090
 Upon entering the cemetery the police did not take the necessary precautions 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.620
 they were dominated by the desire to catch the criminal as soon as possible 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.750
 he had gone ahead and that was his mistake 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.290
 Suddenly one of them fell to the ground bleeding in gushes down his throat and 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.400
 his partner had to help him but he managed to take a picture with a camera 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.330
 who carried in his pocket the dark area of ​​the cemetery where he had to 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:00.930
 find the criminal 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.760
 when he revealed the reel the surprise was huge 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.410
 next to one of the tombs you could see the silhouette of a teddy bear 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.060
 with a red light on his head carrying an ax in his left hand 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:15.499
 the photos went public and the rumors spread 

00:02:15.499 --> 00:02:19.309
 many of the inhabitants of the city came to believe that it was a 

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.900
 demon 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.879
 and so much so that the church decided to take part in the matter and proposed a 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:28.079
 series of rites and prayers to try to fight with the ceal that causes the 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:29.359
 misfortunes 

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:33.639
 multiple prayers and professions were held without the murderer 

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:37.629
 cease until one day tere appeared out of nowhere and stands in front of the 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:39.049
 frightened crowd 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:42.489
 he cried blood and shouted to all those who prayed 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.400
 the priest approached without hesitation the rag doll and sprinkled it with water 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.340
 blessed and in that instant 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.800
 td began to expel blood all over his limbs until he knelt 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.909
 and it exploded in front of people 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:59.419
 the devil was defeated and people could go back to sleep quietly forever or 

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:04.719
 at least they believed until in 1998 a similar murder occurred 

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:07.850
