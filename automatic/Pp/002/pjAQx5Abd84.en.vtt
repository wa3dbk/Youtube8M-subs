bring you a video tutorial about one of

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.390 
bring you a video tutorial about one of
the<00:00:06.089> first<00:00:07.020> flamenco<00:00:07.560> songs<00:00:07.770> I<00:00:07.950> learned<00:00:08.220> this

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
the first flamenco songs I learned this

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.299 
the first flamenco songs I learned this
is<00:00:08.610> called<00:00:08.880> tempest<00:00:09.840> add<00:00:10.019> by<00:00:10.650> juan<00:00:11.040> serrano

i'm<00:00:11.700> just<00:00:11.849> going<00:00:12.000> to<00:00:12.059> cover<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.509> strumming

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
i'm just going to cover the strumming

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.919 
i'm just going to cover the strumming
pattern<00:00:13.290> in<00:00:13.740> this<00:00:13.889> video<00:00:14.420> this<00:00:15.420> is<00:00:15.599> like<00:00:15.750> one

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
pattern in this video this is like one

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.140 
pattern in this video this is like one
of<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.109> very<00:00:16.320> first<00:00:16.740> I<00:00:17.369> think<00:00:17.730> was<00:00:17.970> like<00:00:18.000> the

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
of the very first I think was like the

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.700 
of the very first I think was like the
fourth<00:00:18.480> video<00:00:18.840> that<00:00:19.020> I<00:00:19.050> ever<00:00:19.080> uploaded<00:00:19.439> to

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
fourth video that I ever uploaded to

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.590 
fourth video that I ever uploaded to
YouTube<00:00:20.100> something<00:00:20.490> like<00:00:20.609> that<00:00:20.820> was<00:00:21.449> this

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
YouTube something like that was this

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.620 
YouTube something like that was this
song<00:00:21.840> tempest<00:00:22.230> taught<00:00:22.439> so<00:00:23.279> it's<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.210> long<00:00:24.390> time

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
song tempest taught so it's a long time

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.019 
song tempest taught so it's a long time
overdue<00:00:24.900> for<00:00:25.199> this<00:00:25.320> tutorial<00:00:25.949> but<00:00:26.699> anyways

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
overdue for this tutorial but anyways

this<00:00:27.539> is<00:00:27.689> it<00:00:27.869> this<00:00:28.500> is<00:00:28.680> just<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:29.070> strumming

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
this is it this is just the strumming

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.130 
this is it this is just the strumming
pattern<00:00:29.429> hopefully<00:00:30.390> I'll<00:00:30.510> be<00:00:30.539> able<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:30.810> get<00:00:30.929> to

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
pattern hopefully I'll be able to get to

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.160 
pattern hopefully I'll be able to get to
the<00:00:31.890> rest<00:00:32.099> of<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.279> song<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.640> other<00:00:32.730> videos<00:00:33.170> de

strumming<00:00:34.500> pattern<00:00:34.860> is<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.760> rumba<00:00:36.420> in<00:00:36.649> 4/4<00:00:37.649> time

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
strumming pattern is a rumba in 4/4 time

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.819 
strumming pattern is a rumba in 4/4 time
we're<00:00:38.940> going<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.120> play<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.660> E<00:00:39.690> minor<00:00:40.260> chord<00:00:40.379> as

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
we're going to play the E minor chord as

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.930 
we're going to play the E minor chord as
we<00:00:41.730> practice<00:00:42.120> this<00:00:42.270> pattern<00:00:43.670> so<00:00:44.670> these<00:00:44.789> are

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
we practice this pattern so these are

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.560 
we practice this pattern so these are
the<00:00:45.030> strokes<00:00:45.329> with<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.600> pattern<00:00:47.390> first<00:00:48.390> the

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
the strokes with a pattern first the

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.860 
the strokes with a pattern first the
thumb<00:00:48.809> plucks<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.410> bass<00:00:49.559> note<00:00:50.420> then<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.449> down

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
thumb plucks the bass note then a down

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.160 
thumb plucks the bass note then a down
up<00:00:52.789> hit<00:00:54.079> up<00:00:55.079> with<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.500> thumb<00:00:55.739> down<00:00:56.730> up

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
up hit up with the thumb down up

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.500 
up hit up with the thumb down up
so<00:00:59.100> again<00:00:59.430> pluck<00:01:00.180> with<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.420> thumb<00:01:01.910> down<00:01:02.910> up

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
so again pluck with the thumb down up

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.990 
so again pluck with the thumb down up
hit<00:01:04.640> up<00:01:05.640> with<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.970> thumb<00:01:06.240> down<00:01:07.020> up<00:01:07.940> okay<00:01:08.940> so

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
hit up with the thumb down up okay so

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.840 
hit up with the thumb down up okay so
I'm<00:01:09.180> going<00:01:09.300> to<00:01:09.330> do<00:01:09.420> that<00:01:09.540> in<00:01:09.720> slow<00:01:10.140> motion<00:01:10.380> as<00:01:10.740> I

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
I'm going to do that in slow motion as I

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:21.490 
I'm going to do that in slow motion as I
count<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:13.550> one<00:01:15.020> two<00:01:16.020> three<00:01:18.110> four<00:01:19.729> one<00:01:20.729> two

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
count it one two three four one two

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.530 
count it one two three four one two
three<00:01:23.090> four<00:01:25.880> so<00:01:26.880> there's<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.119> little<00:01:27.300> bit<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.479> a

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
three four so there's a little bit of a

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.210 
three four so there's a little bit of a
tricky<00:01:27.810> part<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.200> this<00:01:28.290> pattern<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:29.100> that's

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
tricky part to this pattern and that's

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.240 
tricky part to this pattern and that's
after<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:29.640> do<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.940> hit<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.530> lot<00:01:31.530> of<00:01:31.619> my<00:01:31.740> some<00:01:32.160> of

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
after I do the hit a lot of my some of

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.150 
after I do the hit a lot of my some of
my<00:01:32.369> other<00:01:32.490> um<00:01:33.259> some<00:01:34.259> of<00:01:34.380> my<00:01:34.500> other<00:01:34.619> strumming

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.160 
my other um some of my other strumming

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.980 
my other um some of my other strumming
patterns<00:01:35.490> after<00:01:36.180> I<00:01:36.210> do<00:01:36.300> that<00:01:36.420> hit

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
patterns after I do that hit

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.820 
patterns after I do that hit
I<00:01:37.020> actually<00:01:38.300> brush<00:01:39.300> up<00:01:39.570> with<00:01:39.899> the<00:01:40.200> the

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
I actually brush up with the the

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.230 
I actually brush up with the the
upstroke<00:01:41.160> is<00:01:41.340> with<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.640> fingers<00:01:41.940> the<00:01:42.030> flesh

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
upstroke is with the fingers the flesh

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.120 
upstroke is with the fingers the flesh
side<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.539> fingers<00:01:42.810> brushing<00:01:43.080> up<00:01:43.410> but<00:01:44.039> in

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
side of the fingers brushing up but in

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.260 
side of the fingers brushing up but in
this<00:01:44.250> case<00:01:44.429> it's<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.700> little<00:01:44.789> bit<00:01:45.060> different

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
this case it's a little bit different

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.850 
this case it's a little bit different
has<00:01:45.509> more<00:01:45.750> rhythmic<00:01:46.140> quality<00:01:46.229> so<00:01:46.619> when<00:01:46.740> I<00:01:46.770> do

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
has more rhythmic quality so when I do

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.609 
has more rhythmic quality so when I do
that<00:01:47.039> hit<00:01:47.340> I<00:01:47.550> let<00:01:47.910> my<00:01:48.030> bit<00:01:48.240> my<00:01:48.539> hand<00:01:48.780> rebound

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
that hit I let my bit my hand rebound

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.169 
that hit I let my bit my hand rebound
real<00:01:50.130> quick<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:51.030> my<00:01:51.390> thumb<00:01:51.600> comes<00:01:52.070> under<00:01:53.179> for

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:54.179 
real quick and my thumb comes under for

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:57.210 
real quick and my thumb comes under for
the<00:01:54.210> up<00:01:54.390> shock<00:01:54.660> with<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.899> thumb

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.770 

so<00:01:58.220> you<00:01:58.280> might<00:01:58.430> practice<00:01:59.180> that<00:01:59.360> movement<00:01:59.750> a

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
so you might practice that movement a

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.450 
so you might practice that movement a
little<00:01:59.900> bit<00:02:00.200> let<00:02:00.680> the<00:02:00.800> hand<00:02:01.040> rebound

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
little bit let the hand rebound

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.790 
little bit let the hand rebound
naturally<00:02:04.930> the<00:02:05.930> thumb<00:02:06.200> gets<00:02:06.440> under<00:02:06.710> there

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
naturally the thumb gets under there

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.340 
naturally the thumb gets under there
real<00:02:07.040> quick<00:02:07.280> just<00:02:07.490> to<00:02:08.240> let<00:02:08.479> gravity<00:02:08.660> drop<00:02:09.200> the

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
real quick just to let gravity drop the

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:17.130 
real quick just to let gravity drop the
thumb<00:02:09.590> and<00:02:10.399> back<00:02:10.580> up<00:02:11.920> okay<00:02:12.920> one<00:02:14.170> two<00:02:15.760> three

the strumming pattern to embellish it a
little<00:02:46.560> bit<00:02:46.739> that<00:02:46.920> I<00:02:46.980> do<00:02:47.040> sometimes<00:02:47.900> which<00:02:48.900> is

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
little bit that I do sometimes which is

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.920 
little bit that I do sometimes which is
filling<00:02:49.560> out<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:49.799> fingers<00:02:50.299> the<00:02:51.299> pinky<00:02:51.719> ring

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
middle index can call this rasgueado

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:17.170 
middle index can call this rasgueado
that<00:02:56.010> so<00:02:56.459> 1<00:02:57.620> 2<00:02:59.359> so<00:03:00.359> 1<00:03:01.670> 2<00:03:04.459> 4<00:03:05.780> 1<00:03:06.950> 2<00:03:08.329> 3<00:03:09.739> 4<00:03:11.150> 1<00:03:12.150> 2<00:03:13.909> 3<00:03:15.169> 4<00:03:16.169> ok

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
that so 1 2 so 1 2 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 ok

now<00:03:18.180> let's<00:03:18.419> try<00:03:18.599> it<00:03:18.659> a<00:03:18.810> little<00:03:18.900> bit<00:03:19.169> faster

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
now let's try it a little bit faster

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:51.050 
now let's try it a little bit faster
speed<00:03:48.379> okay<00:03:49.379> so<00:03:49.440> I'll<00:03:49.799> play<00:03:50.069> first<00:03:50.879> few
