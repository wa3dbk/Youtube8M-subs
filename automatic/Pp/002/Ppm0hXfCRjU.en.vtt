00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:06.899
 you smell drivers like they are back 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.420
 with another video more this time we 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.130
 I want to show the weapons that come in 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.890
 the downloadable content that they just 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:18.210
 release about two weeks ago on xbox 

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:20.789
 live that is the content of scuffle if 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.560
 they put this weapon in Spanish 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.859
 fray 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.609
 and come then communes that will be us 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.810
 ten weapons 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.359
 now we are going to realize 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.220
 exactly how many are right now by 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.820
 example that I bring equipped is the 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.820
 carbine 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:40.240
 reagan level 4 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.730
 we enter the fuse and synthetics to the 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.920
 level 7 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.579
 punishing the bloody herd at 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.579
 level 8 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.750
 snippert indra m 90 at level 5 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:03.980
 here we are in the citadel where 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.980
 is 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:10.810
 cortez the spectra 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:14.320
 and here is a monkey with each type of damage 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:17.860
 what can you do that is the armor in 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.380
 health or blood and the shield does not 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.030
 so if you want we will apologize 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.510
 they see how they react the low of 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.510
 flown 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.039
 like a shotgun the type 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.810
 electricity 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.810
 to see is the health 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.310
 full 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.280
 is very very effective these weapons very 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.159
 powerful 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.909
 it is terrible is very favorite is a 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.780
 carbine 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.740
 in pretty quickly 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.740
 a cadence 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.100
 everyone 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.870
 he personally takes three bullets a 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.530
 normal apartment 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.530
 we go 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.780
 455 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.550
 the karma for gay enemies is 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.250
 very good 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.430
 in the absence of flown 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.049
 this is also one of my favorites 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.700
 or almost does not have aim but 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:29.700
 they will consist a lot of damage 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.590
 and against anything with what you 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:37.590
 You put it as low 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.010
 Brings a lot of bullets 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:50.520
 the show is I want to be doing 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:52.560
 small bursts and kicked and ximo 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.110
 and finally another of my 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.320
 favorites and that is content that 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:02.780
 these are my favorites this rifle is 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.780
 incredible is an automatic sticker 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:09.500
 that's 25 bullets 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.880
 4 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.880
 like 5 seconds 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.180
 it's pretty stable enough 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:36.500
 magically 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.500
 for my pleasures in half 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.400
 let's see which others more 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.920
 there is another snap which is also very 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.920
 cool 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:59.490
 and this is another cerberus weapon 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:04:04.490
 there is another this is a machine submachine gun 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:04.490
 of plasma get and I think it's complete 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.440
 to call 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.990
 they are not all waters 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.960
 then exactly four are 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:29.639
 seven years 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.639
 what we bring is the 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:39.039
 Reserve 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:47.979
 It is also very similar to the others 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:53.789
 factors much faster a burst of 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:53.789
 three also has very good marksmanship 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:02.300
 with the blood of a single burst everything is 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.300
 takes it 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.730
 without ammunition 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:20.240
 the low 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.050
 has a level of damage 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.000
 is incredibly 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.790
 how they shoot 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.150
 the eye 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:52.840
 today it is but the bullets square views of 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.840
 flown 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.970
 and this is like a deformation 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:08.950
 he looks at her together full the rossi trigger 

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:12.130
 how to zoom 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.660
 d 

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:32.190
 to see how to introduce chattering 

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:32.190
 and you are not in the neighborhood 

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:42.190
 plus
