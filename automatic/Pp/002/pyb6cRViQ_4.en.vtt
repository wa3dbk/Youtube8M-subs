00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
right way I've really thought about just

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.869 
right way I've really thought about just
now<00:00:47.940> I'm<00:00:48.239> kind<00:00:48.510> of<00:00:48.539> still<00:00:49.579> trying<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.640> figure

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
now I'm kind of still trying to figure

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.119 
now I'm kind of still trying to figure
out<00:00:50.989> what<00:00:51.989> went<00:00:52.110> wrong<00:00:52.320> in<00:00:52.379> this<00:00:52.590> series<00:00:52.949> or

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
out what went wrong in this series or

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.389 
out what went wrong in this series or
things<00:00:53.640> that<00:00:53.699> we<00:00:53.879> do<00:00:54.000> right<00:00:54.210> so<00:00:55.280> see<00:00:56.280> what

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
things that we do right so see what

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.450 
things that we do right so see what
happens<00:01:00.289> as<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:01.500> look<00:01:01.680> at<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.920> team<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.309> have

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
happens as you look at the team you have

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.240 
happens as you look at the team you have
now<00:01:02.670> how<00:01:03.390> do<00:01:03.449> you<00:01:03.539> see<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:03.870> in<00:01:04.019> terms<00:01:04.049> of<00:01:04.530> being

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
now how do you see it in terms of being

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.740 
now how do you see it in terms of being
a<00:01:05.369> contender<00:01:05.760> that<00:01:05.970> can<00:01:06.090> come<00:01:06.270> back<00:01:06.390> again<00:01:06.689> and

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750
