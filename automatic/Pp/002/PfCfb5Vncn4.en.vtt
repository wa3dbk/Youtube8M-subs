cannot<00:01:53.690> tell<00:01:53.990> you<00:01:54.050> how<00:01:54.380> important<00:01:54.830> it<00:01:54.890> is<00:01:55.040> to

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
cannot tell you how important it is to

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.340 
cannot tell you how important it is to
blend<00:01:55.550> when<00:01:56.150> you<00:01:56.270> are<00:01:56.390> using<00:01:56.600> such<00:01:56.990> thin

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
blend when you are using such thin

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.230 
blend when you are using such thin
pieces<00:01:57.670> next<00:01:58.670> you're<00:01:58.790> gonna<00:01:58.880> want<00:01:58.970> to<00:01:59.150> make

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
pieces next you're gonna want to make

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.060 
pieces next you're gonna want to make
the<00:01:59.390> tail<00:01:59.660> and<00:01:59.930> you<00:02:00.140> basically<00:02:00.650> start<00:02:00.950> off

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
the tail and you basically start off

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.130 
the tail and you basically start off
with<00:02:01.250> a<00:02:01.280> teardrop<00:02:01.790> shape<00:02:02.060> and<00:02:02.270> then<00:02:02.840> you<00:02:02.960> make

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
with a teardrop shape and then you make

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.200 
with a teardrop shape and then you make
a<00:02:03.170> little<00:02:03.410> indentation<00:02:03.800> right<00:02:04.610> in<00:02:04.820> the<00:02:04.910> middle

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
a little indentation right in the middle

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.810 
a little indentation right in the middle
of<00:02:05.510> the<00:02:05.750> fat<00:02:05.990> end<00:02:06.200> and<00:02:06.500> it<00:02:07.100> looks<00:02:07.310> just<00:02:07.550> like<00:02:07.760> a

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
of the fat end and it looks just like a

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.430 
of the fat end and it looks just like a
heart<00:02:08.150> next<00:02:08.780> you're<00:02:08.900> gonna<00:02:08.960> cut<00:02:09.200> off<00:02:09.290> the

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
heart next you're gonna cut off the

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.650 
heart next you're gonna cut off the
little<00:02:09.650> tip<00:02:10.010> of<00:02:10.220> the<00:02:10.400> heart<00:02:10.670> and<00:02:10.850> attach<00:02:11.360> this

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
little tip of the heart and attach this

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:18.070 
little tip of the heart and attach this
to<00:02:11.720> the<00:02:11.990> body<00:02:16.420> once<00:02:17.420> you<00:02:17.540> have<00:02:17.630> your<00:02:17.720> memorable

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
to the body once you have your memorable

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.900 
to the body once you have your memorable
body<00:02:18.380> all<00:02:18.650> you're<00:02:18.770> gonna<00:02:18.890> do<00:02:19.040> now<00:02:19.190> is<00:02:19.370> place<00:02:19.700> it

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
body all you're gonna do now is place it

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.830 
body all you're gonna do now is place it
right<00:02:20.090> on<00:02:20.150> to<00:02:20.540> the<00:02:20.660> rainbow<00:02:22.510> then<00:02:23.510> you're<00:02:23.690> just

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
right on to the rainbow then you're just

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.810 
right on to the rainbow then you're just
going<00:02:24.050> to<00:02:24.080> add<00:02:24.260> a<00:02:24.530> little<00:02:24.770> blue<00:02:25.040> oval<00:02:25.490> for<00:02:25.730> the

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
going to add a little blue oval for the

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:31.060 
going to add a little blue oval for the
mouth<00:02:28.930> this<00:02:29.930> is<00:02:30.170> what<00:02:30.350> your<00:02:30.470> piece<00:02:30.650> looks<00:02:30.890> like

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
mouth this is what your piece looks like

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:32.890 
mouth this is what your piece looks like
so<00:02:31.250> far<00:02:31.280> and<00:02:31.760> here's<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:32.150> fun<00:02:32.360> part<00:02:32.390> in<00:02:32.750> my

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
so far and here's the fun part in my

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.200 
so far and here's the fun part in my
opinion<00:02:33.350> you're<00:02:33.800> gonna<00:02:33.950> start<00:02:34.250> folding<00:02:34.580> the

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
opinion you're gonna start folding the

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.360 
opinion you're gonna start folding the
rainbow<00:02:35.750> to<00:02:36.050> kind<00:02:36.290> of<00:02:36.350> make<00:02:36.560> the<00:02:36.710> loopy<00:02:37.130> shape

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
rainbow to kind of make the loopy shape

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.640 
rainbow to kind of make the loopy shape
so<00:02:37.610> you're<00:02:37.730> gonna<00:02:37.850> want<00:02:38.180> to<00:02:38.300> be<00:02:38.930> very<00:02:39.200> careful

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
so you're gonna want to be very careful

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.410 
so you're gonna want to be very careful
when<00:02:39.800> doing<00:02:40.130> this<00:02:40.280> you're<00:02:40.790> gonna<00:02:40.910> take<00:02:41.240> the

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
when doing this you're gonna take the

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.360 
when doing this you're gonna take the
end<00:02:41.600> of<00:02:41.810> the<00:02:41.900> rainbow<00:02:42.170> and<00:02:42.380> kind<00:02:42.830> of<00:02:42.890> make<00:02:43.130> this

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
end of the rainbow and kind of make this

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.960 
end of the rainbow and kind of make this
L<00:02:44.060> shape<00:02:44.120> or<00:02:44.900> S<00:02:45.050> shape<00:02:45.380> like<00:02:45.620> so<00:02:45.650> and<00:02:46.280> then

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
L shape or S shape like so and then

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.260 
L shape or S shape like so and then
you're<00:02:47.030> gonna<00:02:47.180> pull<00:02:47.600> it<00:02:47.630> over<00:02:48.230> and<00:02:49.030> just<00:02:50.030> kind

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
you're gonna pull it over and just kind

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.400 
you're gonna pull it over and just kind
of<00:02:51.100> press<00:02:52.100> it<00:02:52.130> down<00:02:52.720> it<00:02:53.720> kind<00:02:53.959> of<00:02:54.050> looks<00:02:54.230> like<00:02:54.320> a

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
of press it down it kind of looks like a

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.470 
of press it down it kind of looks like a
flat<00:02:54.800> noodle<00:02:55.040> to<00:02:55.430> me<00:02:55.580> and<00:02:55.820> you're<00:02:56.240> just<00:02:56.270> gonna

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
flat noodle to me and you're just gonna

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.510 
flat noodle to me and you're just gonna
keep<00:02:56.750> doing<00:02:57.110> this<00:02:57.260> and<00:02:57.530> you<00:02:57.620> can<00:02:58.130> make<00:02:58.250> this<00:02:58.340> as

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
keep doing this and you can make this as

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.820 
keep doing this and you can make this as
wide<00:02:58.880> and<00:02:59.570> as<00:02:59.690> thin<00:02:59.959> as<00:03:00.110> you<00:03:00.140> want<00:03:00.440> as<00:03:00.620> many

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
wide and as thin as you want as many

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:06.040 
wide and as thin as you want as many
loops<00:03:01.100> as<00:03:01.340> you<00:03:01.520> want<00:03:02.980> and<00:03:04.480> then<00:03:05.480> this<00:03:05.720> is<00:03:05.900> what

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
loops as you want and then this is what

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.600 
loops as you want and then this is what
it<00:03:06.170> looks<00:03:06.320> like<00:03:06.500> now<00:03:07.070> if<00:03:07.160> you<00:03:07.280> want<00:03:07.430> to<00:03:07.489> make

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
it looks like now if you want to make

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:08.920 
it looks like now if you want to make
this<00:03:07.730> into<00:03:08.030> a<00:03:08.060> charm<00:03:08.360> the<00:03:08.480> last<00:03:08.660> thing<00:03:08.810> you'd

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
this into a charm the last thing you'd

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.199 
this into a charm the last thing you'd
want<00:03:08.959> to<00:03:09.230> do<00:03:09.410> is<00:03:09.440> put<00:03:09.800> in<00:03:09.920> I<00:03:10.100> pin<00:03:10.340> so<00:03:10.910> the<00:03:11.000> first

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
want to do is put in I pin so the first

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.030 
want to do is put in I pin so the first
one<00:03:11.600> I<00:03:11.690> put<00:03:11.930> is<00:03:12.080> right<00:03:12.290> above<00:03:12.500> me<00:03:12.709> I'm<00:03:12.770> a<00:03:12.860> girl

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
one I put is right above me I'm a girl

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.160 
one I put is right above me I'm a girl
on<00:03:13.220> some<00:03:13.400> shoulder<00:03:13.790> and<00:03:13.970> then<00:03:14.480> the<00:03:14.510> second<00:03:15.020> one

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
on some shoulder and then the second one

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.470 
on some shoulder and then the second one
I<00:03:15.200> put<00:03:15.530> is<00:03:15.770> right<00:03:16.250> in<00:03:16.459> between<00:03:16.970> some<00:03:17.300> of<00:03:17.330> the

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
I put is right in between some of the

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.870 
I put is right in between some of the
loops<00:03:17.750> so<00:03:17.959> you<00:03:18.020> can't<00:03:18.320> really<00:03:18.530> see<00:03:18.860> it<00:03:18.890> and<00:03:19.310> I

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
loops so you can't really see it and I

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.400 
loops so you can't really see it and I
think<00:03:20.180> this<00:03:20.330> looks<00:03:20.510> better<00:03:20.570> than<00:03:20.930> putting<00:03:21.170> it

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
think this looks better than putting it

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.110 
think this looks better than putting it
in<00:03:21.560> one<00:03:21.739> of<00:03:21.890> the<00:03:21.980> thinner<00:03:22.220> places<00:03:22.640> like<00:03:22.790> at<00:03:22.970> the

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
in one of the thinner places like at the

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.420 
in one of the thinner places like at the
end<00:03:23.330> because<00:03:24.020> the<00:03:24.320> eye<00:03:24.350> pin<00:03:24.680> could<00:03:24.920> just<00:03:25.160> break

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
end because the eye pin could just break

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.330 
end because the eye pin could just break
the<00:03:25.700> rainbow<00:03:26.480> piece<00:03:26.750> after<00:03:27.200> the<00:03:27.739> charmers<00:03:28.130> bit

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
the rainbow piece after the charmers bit

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:51.190 
the rainbow piece after the charmers bit
we're<00:03:28.550> going<00:03:28.700> to<00:03:28.760> paint<00:03:28.970> on<00:03:29.060> the<00:03:29.180> features

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.040 

here<00:03:52.200> is<00:03:52.410> a<00:03:52.440> look<00:03:52.710> at<00:03:52.890> the<00:03:53.100> piece<00:03:53.370> glazed<00:03:53.910> and<00:03:54.390> I

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
here is a look at the piece glazed and I

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.050 
here is a look at the piece glazed and I
really<00:03:55.350> like<00:03:55.530> how<00:03:55.710> it<00:03:55.890> turned<00:03:56.040> out<00:03:56.280> this<00:03:56.880> can

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
really like how it turned out this can

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:05.570 
really like how it turned out this can
obviously<00:03:57.240> be<00:03:57.810> made<00:03:57.990> into<00:03:58.470> a<00:03:58.500> necklace<00:04:04.550> so<00:04:05.550> I
