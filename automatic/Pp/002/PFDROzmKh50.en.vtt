00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.149 
like the smooth scrolling a lot more I
don't<00:01:54.899> use<00:01:55.200> flock<00:01:55.470> anymore<00:01:55.920> just<00:01:56.070> because

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
don't use flock anymore just because

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.260 
don't use flock anymore just because
it's<00:01:56.549> not<00:01:56.700> compatible

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
it's not compatible

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.990 
it's not compatible
come<00:01:57.540> battable<00:01:57.930> with<00:01:58.079> smart<00:01:58.320> scroll<00:01:59.000> another

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
come battable with smart scroll another

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.749 
come battable with smart scroll another
another<00:02:00.570> thing<00:02:00.869> is<00:02:01.049> that<00:02:01.259> if<00:02:01.890> your<00:02:02.100> processor

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
another thing is that if your processor

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.260 
another thing is that if your processor
is<00:02:02.909> hugged<00:02:03.719> up<00:02:03.899> by<00:02:04.049> some<00:02:04.490> processes<00:02:05.490> as<00:02:05.850> if<00:02:06.149> you

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
is hugged up by some processes as if you

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.869 
is hugged up by some processes as if you
will<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:07.170> scrolling<00:02:07.590> becomes<00:02:07.829> slower<00:02:08.610> a

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
will the scrolling becomes slower a

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.969 
will the scrolling becomes slower a
little<00:02:08.940> bit<00:02:09.179> lagged<00:02:09.509> sometimes<00:02:10.110> when<00:02:10.319> I<00:02:10.349> will

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
little bit lagged sometimes when I will

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.430 
little bit lagged sometimes when I will
bring<00:02:11.310> up<00:02:11.520> new<00:02:11.910> web<00:02:12.150> pages<00:02:12.390> with

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
bring up new web pages with

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.490 
bring up new web pages with
sorry<00:02:14.120> things<00:02:15.120> will<00:02:15.360> be<00:02:15.510> a<00:02:15.540> little<00:02:15.870> bit<00:02:16.020> slower

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
sorry things will be a little bit slower

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.040 
sorry things will be a little bit slower
and<00:02:16.830> then<00:02:17.280> they<00:02:17.640> will<00:02:17.820> gradually<00:02:18.300> improve<00:02:18.510> I

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
and then they will gradually improve I

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.380 
and then they will gradually improve I
also<00:02:19.770> work<00:02:20.010> on<00:02:20.100> a<00:02:20.190> Mac<00:02:20.370> Pro<00:02:20.640> and<00:02:20.820> I<00:02:21.060> haven't

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
also work on a Mac Pro and I haven't

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.330 
also work on a Mac Pro and I haven't
noticed<00:02:21.660> that<00:02:21.720> on<00:02:22.080> there<00:02:22.320> so<00:02:22.590> uh<00:02:22.620> you<00:02:23.220> know

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
noticed that on there so uh you know

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.610 
noticed that on there so uh you know
computing<00:02:24.210> power<00:02:24.390> I<00:02:24.480> guess<00:02:24.780> speeds<00:02:25.080> up<00:02:25.260> smarts

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
computing power I guess speeds up smarts

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.220 
computing power I guess speeds up smarts
brought<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:26.040> scroll<00:02:26.340> so<00:02:26.880> um<00:02:27.150> you<00:02:27.660> know<00:02:27.750> I<00:02:27.780> hope
