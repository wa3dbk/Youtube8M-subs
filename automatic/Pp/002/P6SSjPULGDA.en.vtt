this<00:00:04.380> is<00:00:04.530> the<00:00:04.650> Polaris<00:00:05.100> strive<00:00:05.700> it's<00:00:06.540> the

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
this is the Polaris strive it's the

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.379 
this is the Polaris strive it's the
first<00:00:07.200> well<00:00:07.920> it's<00:00:08.249> part<00:00:08.519> of<00:00:08.610> a<00:00:08.700> series<00:00:08.969> of<00:00:09.120> the

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
first well it's part of a series of the

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.209 
first well it's part of a series of the
first<00:00:09.660> electric<00:00:10.049> bikes<00:00:10.320> that<00:00:10.530> Polaris<00:00:11.009> has

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
first electric bikes that Polaris has

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.409 
first electric bikes that Polaris has
ever<00:00:11.579> done<00:00:12.329> and<00:00:12.629> it<00:00:13.559> uses<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:14.039> same<00:00:14.400> hub<00:00:15.179> motor

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:15.419 
ever done and it uses the same hub motor

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:18.230 
ever done and it uses the same hub motor
and<00:00:15.839> battery<00:00:16.049> and<00:00:16.410> control<00:00:16.740> system<00:00:17.250> that<00:00:17.849> the

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
and battery and control system that the

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.120 
and battery and control system that the
other<00:00:18.449> two<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:19.019> vector<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.500> meridian<00:00:19.920> use

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
other two the vector the meridian use

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.519 
other two the vector the meridian use
but<00:00:21.029> it<00:00:21.119> offers<00:00:21.359> this<00:00:21.570> nice<00:00:21.779> sort<00:00:22.050> of<00:00:22.109> step

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
but it offers this nice sort of step

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.769 
but it offers this nice sort of step
through<00:00:22.859> design<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.669> it<00:00:23.820> places<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.419> battery

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
through design and it places the battery

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.739 
through design and it places the battery
on<00:00:24.990> this<00:00:25.529> rear<00:00:25.769> rack<00:00:25.980> here<00:00:26.279> whereas<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.720> other

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:27.749 
on this rear rack here whereas the other

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:30.409 
on this rear rack here whereas the other
one<00:00:28.019> has<00:00:28.199> it<00:00:28.410> in<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:29.070> in<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.519> down<00:00:29.759> tube<00:00:30.060> so

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:30.419 
one has it in the in the down tube so

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:32.210 
one has it in the in the down tube so
I'm<00:00:30.990> going<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.169> go<00:00:31.289> through<00:00:31.499> the<00:00:31.589> specs<00:00:31.980> real

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:32.220 
I'm going to go through the specs real

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.300 
I'm going to go through the specs real
quick<00:00:32.460> on<00:00:32.670> this<00:00:32.900> it's<00:00:33.900> a<00:00:34.020> 250<00:00:34.890> watt<00:00:35.070> motor

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:35.310 
quick on this it's a 250 watt motor

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.040 
quick on this it's a 250 watt motor
which<00:00:35.640> is<00:00:35.760> actually<00:00:35.940> kind<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.540> small<00:00:36.780> in<00:00:36.960> the

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
which is actually kind of small in the

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.660 
which is actually kind of small in the
world<00:00:37.200> of<00:00:37.290> electric<00:00:37.680> bikes<00:00:37.890> but<00:00:38.370> it<00:00:38.460> does

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
world of electric bikes but it does

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.080 
world of electric bikes but it does
offer<00:00:39.950> regenerative<00:00:40.950> braking<00:00:41.430> which<00:00:41.940> is

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
offer regenerative braking which is

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.970 
offer regenerative braking which is
really<00:00:42.330> cool<00:00:42.600> that's<00:00:43.290> kind<00:00:43.560> of<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.740> rarity

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
really cool that's kind of a rarity

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.640 
really cool that's kind of a rarity
these<00:00:44.880> days<00:00:44.960> probably<00:00:45.960> getting<00:00:46.320> more<00:00:46.560> and

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:46.650 
these days probably getting more and

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.650 
these days probably getting more and
more<00:00:46.740> popular<00:00:47.040> on<00:00:47.490> other<00:00:47.670> electric<00:00:48.120> bikes<00:00:48.360> but

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
more popular on other electric bikes but

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.980 
more popular on other electric bikes but
it's<00:00:49.410> nice<00:00:49.650> it<00:00:49.860> extends<00:00:50.310> your<00:00:50.370> range<00:00:50.780> it<00:00:51.780> just

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:51.990 
it's nice it extends your range it just

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.170 
it's nice it extends your range it just
doesn't<00:00:52.140> offer<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.470> whole<00:00:52.620> lot<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:52.830> power<00:00:53.180> and

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
doesn't offer a whole lot of power and

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.520 
doesn't offer a whole lot of power and
it's<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.450> little<00:00:54.540> bit<00:00:54.750> noisy<00:00:55.020> it<00:00:55.140> kind<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.380> like

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
it's a little bit noisy it kind of like

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.510 
it's a little bit noisy it kind of like
or<00:00:56.030> creates<00:00:57.030> this<00:00:57.180> kind<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:58.040> chicken<00:00:59.040> sound<00:00:59.310> or

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
or creates this kind of chicken sound or

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.040 
or creates this kind of chicken sound or
something<00:00:59.910> I<00:01:00.120> guess<00:01:00.150> and<00:01:00.750> you've<00:01:00.870> got<00:01:00.990> the

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
something I guess and you've got the

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.380 
something I guess and you've got the
controller<00:01:01.560> and<00:01:01.890> an<00:01:02.070> electronics<00:01:02.760> down<00:01:02.910> here

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
controller and an electronics down here

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.270 
controller and an electronics down here
but<00:01:03.810> that's<00:01:03.990> an<00:01:04.140> interesting<00:01:04.769> place<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.100> put

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
but that's an interesting place to put

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.740 
but that's an interesting place to put
them<00:01:05.430> because<00:01:05.640> they're<00:01:05.760> actually<00:01:06.120> lower<00:01:06.390> than

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
them because they're actually lower than

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.500 
them because they're actually lower than
the<00:01:07.470> bottom<00:01:07.650> bracket<00:01:08.310> here<00:01:08.520> bottom<00:01:09.000> than<00:01:09.150> even

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
the bottom bracket here bottom than even

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.840 
the bottom bracket here bottom than even
the<00:01:09.630> chain<00:01:09.960> ring<00:01:10.230> and<00:01:10.440> so<00:01:10.620> that<00:01:11.400> can<00:01:11.580> be<00:01:11.610> kind

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
the chain ring and so that can be kind

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.280 
the chain ring and so that can be kind
of<00:01:11.910> a<00:01:12.000> vulnerable<00:01:12.150> place<00:01:12.660> you<00:01:12.960> know<00:01:13.080> down<00:01:13.260> here

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
of a vulnerable place you know down here

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.680 
of a vulnerable place you know down here
with<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.650> rocks<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.160> stuff<00:01:14.370> but<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.450> works

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
with the rocks and stuff but it works

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.670 
with the rocks and stuff but it works
well<00:01:16.200> enough<00:01:16.760> the<00:01:17.760> battery<00:01:18.180> up<00:01:18.540> here<00:01:18.840> is<00:01:18.930> 36

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
well enough the battery up here is 36

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.950 
well enough the battery up here is 36
volt<00:01:19.920> 10<00:01:20.220> amp<00:01:20.400> hour<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.880> it's<00:01:21.600> just<00:01:21.840> this

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
volt 10 amp hour and it's just this

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.080 
volt 10 amp hour and it's just this
plastic<00:01:22.530> shell<00:01:22.800> thing<00:01:23.100> which<00:01:23.760> can<00:01:23.909> be<00:01:24.060> a

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
plastic shell thing which can be a

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.090 
plastic shell thing which can be a
little<00:01:24.330> bit<00:01:24.510> rattling<00:01:24.990> kind<00:01:25.290> of<00:01:25.350> cheapy<00:01:25.800> you

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
little bit rattling kind of cheapy you

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.420 
little bit rattling kind of cheapy you
know<00:01:26.250> when<00:01:26.970> you're<00:01:27.060> riding<00:01:27.210> over<00:01:27.510> bumps<00:01:27.870> and

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
know when you're riding over bumps and

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.690 
know when you're riding over bumps and
but<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:29.760> works<00:01:30.229> the<00:01:31.229> downside<00:01:32.070> of<00:01:32.100> putting

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
but it works the downside of putting

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.950 
but it works the downside of putting
both<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.030> motor<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.510> battery<00:01:33.780> on<00:01:33.840> the

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
both the motor and the battery on the

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.390 
both the motor and the battery on the
back<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:34.260> that<00:01:34.409> this<00:01:34.530> bike<00:01:34.740> is<00:01:34.770> kind<00:01:35.070> of<00:01:35.130> rear

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
back is that this bike is kind of rear

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.160 
back is that this bike is kind of rear
heavy<00:01:35.700> it's<00:01:35.970> not<00:01:36.150> as<00:01:36.330> evenly<00:01:36.780> distributed

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.830 

this<00:01:40.770> is<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.159> controller<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.240> it<00:01:42.689> works

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
this is the controller and it works

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.410 
this is the controller and it works
really<00:01:42.990> well<00:01:43.110> it's<00:01:43.530> just<00:01:43.680> on<00:01:43.920> switch<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.909> then

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
really well it's just on switch and then

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.179 
really well it's just on switch and then
you<00:01:45.570> cycle<00:01:46.020> through<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.290> power<00:01:46.470> syst<00:01:46.890> levels

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
you cycle through the power syst levels

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.179 
you cycle through the power syst levels
three<00:01:47.580> one<00:01:48.060> two<00:01:48.479> three<00:01:48.659> one<00:01:49.170> two<00:01:49.409> three<00:01:49.830> it

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
three one two three one two three it

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.760 
three one two three one two three it
just<00:01:50.430> goes<00:01:50.610> through<00:01:50.640> like<00:01:51.060> that<00:01:51.240> so<00:01:51.710> kind<00:01:52.710> of

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
just goes through like that so kind of

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.289 
just goes through like that so kind of
can't<00:01:52.950> mess<00:01:53.130> this<00:01:53.159> up<00:01:53.490> it's<00:01:53.759> pretty

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
can't mess this up it's pretty

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
straightforward it doesn't have fenders

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.399 
straightforward it doesn't have fenders
or<00:01:56.670> anything<00:01:57.000> but<00:01:57.149> this<00:01:57.630> battery<00:01:58.020> pack<00:01:58.170> on<00:01:58.320> the

or anything but this battery pack on the
rear<00:01:58.560> is<00:01:58.649> going<00:01:58.799> to<00:01:58.860> kind<00:01:59.039> of<00:01:59.070> keep<00:01:59.220> you<00:01:59.369> dry

guide I like that because it keeps the

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.040 
guide I like that because it keeps the
chain<00:02:06.960> from<00:02:07.200> falling<00:02:07.530> off<00:02:07.759> I've<00:02:08.759> got<00:02:09.050> several

any water bottle braised ons here which
is<00:02:22.950> kind<00:02:23.130> of<00:02:23.190> a<00:02:23.250> bummer<00:02:23.959> it's<00:02:24.959> easy<00:02:25.110> to<00:02:25.260> get

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
is kind of a bummer it's easy to get

thirsty when you're riding a bike it

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.509 
thirsty when you're riding a bike it
does<00:02:28.380> have<00:02:28.560> that<00:02:28.650> nice<00:02:28.830> shock<00:02:29.069> in<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.250> front

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
does have that nice shock in the front

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.610 
does have that nice shock in the front
which<00:02:29.760> I<00:02:29.880> like<00:02:30.090> cuz<00:02:30.690> you<00:02:30.900> know<00:02:30.989> it<00:02:31.140> smooths<00:02:31.440> out

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
which I like cuz you know it smooths out

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.229 
which I like cuz you know it smooths out
the<00:02:31.680> ride<00:02:31.950> a<00:02:31.980> little<00:02:32.069> bit<00:02:32.430> and<00:02:32.819> these<00:02:33.000> tires

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
the ride a little bit and these tires

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:34.580 
the ride a little bit and these tires
are<00:02:33.420> sort<00:02:33.630> of<00:02:33.690> hybrid<00:02:34.080> where<00:02:34.290> it's<00:02:34.410> like

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
are sort of hybrid where it's like

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.979 
are sort of hybrid where it's like
street<00:02:35.430> in<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.700> middle<00:02:35.940> and<00:02:36.209> mountain<00:02:36.870> bike

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
street in the middle and mountain bike

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.090 
street in the middle and mountain bike
on<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.170> side<00:02:38.060> it's<00:02:39.060> like<00:02:39.180> I'm<00:02:39.330> balla<00:02:39.510> you<00:02:39.720> know

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
on the side it's like I'm balla you know

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.410 
on the side it's like I'm balla you know
business<00:02:41.100> on<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:41.519> front<00:02:41.790> party<00:02:42.209> in<00:02:42.239> the<00:02:42.330> back

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
business on the front party in the back

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.190 
business on the front party in the back
it's<00:02:42.930> similar<00:02:43.650> I<00:02:43.830> guess<00:02:44.870> so<00:02:45.870> the<00:02:46.019> cool<00:02:46.170> thing

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
it's similar I guess so the cool thing

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.319 
it's similar I guess so the cool thing
about<00:02:46.440> this<00:02:46.680> though<00:02:46.859> is<00:02:46.890> that<00:02:47.040> it<00:02:47.280> has<00:02:47.459> both

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329 
about this though is that it has both

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:51.289 
about this though is that it has both
throttle<00:02:49.230> mode<00:02:49.350> and<00:02:49.620> pedal<00:02:50.430> assist<00:02:50.730> okay<00:02:51.239> so

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
throttle mode and pedal assist okay so

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:52.849 
throttle mode and pedal assist okay so
if<00:02:51.690> you're<00:02:51.900> pedaling<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.380> spike<00:02:52.590> you<00:02:52.769> know

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:52.859 
if you're pedaling the spike you know

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:54.830 
if you're pedaling the spike you know
we're<00:02:53.040> in<00:02:53.070> three<00:02:53.880> right<00:02:54.060> now<00:02:54.209> as<00:02:54.450> soon<00:02:54.600> as<00:02:54.750> I

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
we're in three right now as soon as I

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.720 
we're in three right now as soon as I
start<00:02:55.049> pedaling<00:02:55.410> it's<00:02:55.859> going<00:02:56.070> to<00:02:56.130> unlock<00:02:56.519> the

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
start pedaling it's going to unlock the

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.340 
start pedaling it's going to unlock the
throttle<00:02:57.150> and<00:02:57.269> then<00:02:57.450> I<00:02:57.510> can<00:02:57.660> start<00:02:57.780> throttling

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
throttle and then I can start throttling

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:59.750 
throttle and then I can start throttling
the<00:02:58.470> bike<00:02:58.620> that's<00:02:58.859> like<00:02:59.010> a<00:02:59.040> safety<00:02:59.310> feature<00:02:59.519> it

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
the bike that's like a safety feature it

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.210 
the bike that's like a safety feature it
won't<00:02:59.970> go<00:03:00.209> until<00:03:00.450> you're<00:03:00.690> moving<00:03:01.079> pedaling<00:03:01.680> or

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
won't go until you're moving pedaling or

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.460 
won't go until you're moving pedaling or
if<00:03:03.090> I<00:03:03.269> want<00:03:03.299> I<00:03:03.570> can<00:03:03.630> just<00:03:03.780> keep<00:03:03.930> pedaling<00:03:04.350> and

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
if I want I can just keep pedaling and

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.020 
if I want I can just keep pedaling and
it'll<00:03:04.709> it'll<00:03:05.040> kick<00:03:05.310> in<00:03:05.340> so<00:03:05.609> I'm<00:03:05.700> going<00:03:05.820> to<00:03:05.880> do

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
it'll it'll kick in so I'm going to do

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.060 
it'll it'll kick in so I'm going to do
that<00:03:06.180> just<00:03:06.810> give<00:03:06.930> you<00:03:06.989> a<00:03:07.019> quick<00:03:07.140> demo<00:03:07.470> listen

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
that just give you a quick demo listen

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:31.540 
that just give you a quick demo listen
for<00:03:08.220> the<00:03:08.340> motor

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.860 

there<00:03:32.550> you<00:03:32.640> go<00:03:32.700> so<00:03:33.450> I<00:03:33.510> don't<00:03:33.660> know<00:03:33.720> if<00:03:33.780> you

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
there you go so I don't know if you

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.750 
there you go so I don't know if you
heard<00:03:34.020> that<00:03:34.080> but<00:03:34.290> it<00:03:34.860> kind<00:03:35.160> of<00:03:35.190> wines<00:03:35.460> when

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
heard that but it kind of wines when

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.490 
heard that but it kind of wines when
you're<00:03:35.970> you<00:03:36.750> know<00:03:36.780> when<00:03:36.870> you're<00:03:36.930> throttling

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
you're you know when you're throttling

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.980 
you're you know when you're throttling
it<00:03:37.680> when<00:03:38.100> I<00:03:38.130> was<00:03:38.280> pedaling<00:03:38.700> and<00:03:38.850> it<00:03:39.510> wind<00:03:39.720> when

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990 
it when I was pedaling and it wind when

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:41.720 
it when I was pedaling and it wind when
I<00:03:40.020> use<00:03:40.230> the<00:03:40.260> brake<00:03:40.650> for<00:03:40.920> regenerative<00:03:41.370> braking

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
I use the brake for regenerative braking

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.300 
I use the brake for regenerative braking
so<00:03:41.970> you<00:03:42.690> know<00:03:42.840> it's<00:03:43.710> just<00:03:43.770> a<00:03:43.920> little<00:03:44.130> bit<00:03:44.220> of

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
so you know it's just a little bit of

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.910 
so you know it's just a little bit of
noise<00:03:44.660> but<00:03:47.330> it<00:03:48.330> considering<00:03:49.290> that<00:03:49.320> noise<00:03:49.650> you

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
noise but it considering that noise you

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.530 
noise but it considering that noise you
know<00:03:49.980> it's<00:03:50.160> not<00:03:50.280> offering<00:03:50.760> a<00:03:50.880> whole<00:03:51.120> lot<00:03:51.390> of

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
know it's not offering a whole lot of

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.270 
know it's not offering a whole lot of
power<00:03:51.690> and<00:03:52.050> that<00:03:52.170> was<00:03:52.320> in<00:03:52.500> that<00:03:52.650> was<00:03:52.860> a<00:03:52.890> third

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
power and that was in that was a third

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.280 
power and that was in that was a third
mode<00:03:53.610> that's<00:03:53.880> like<00:03:54.090> the<00:03:54.210> most<00:03:54.330> powerful<00:03:54.630> that
