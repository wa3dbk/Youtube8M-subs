00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160
 So I'm Drai 25 years old 

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.630
 I am from Greece probably jumps read and I like training since 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:08.299
 prolonged 

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:11.839
 I have only gotten ten men the piece have old people's homes 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:15.299
 and I found it so clear so that said sound and sounds 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.300
 since then I have not worked apart on a spell somewhere else 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:25.119
 rarely once again I have not found one who has learned the profession 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:26.359
 to do everything else 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:28.429
 many people finally 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:31.429
 My friends also have a lot of respect for it 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.020
 You could also not spend it but definitely nice that 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.750
 I do it 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.980
 the reason it's hard but on 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.660
 if it's fun 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.210
 does that make clients feel fun to see this level of severity? 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.800
 and where not 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.680
 yes I already had had deaths 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.000
 and where I have to say now 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.340
 although there were residents who take me a little distance 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.700
 you have to work professionally you have to make sure that you go to the APA 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.590
 do not know how to cross it, so you can 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.140
 However, it may not be as extensive as lame 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.590
 that you can beat them afterwards to beat up any family replacement so soon 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:18.799
 this 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:21.080
 stronger use 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.370
 it is very difficult for those who are well-groomed 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.110
 now I have also after the first station 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.670
 but they are now coming at the end of January with a demented station 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.160
 when and where I still possible 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.050
 Targeted work really only with dementia 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.430
 that keeps the flights back a bit back against July again 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.060
 more on people 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.400
 we have to try 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.740
 about the biography work something about the past of the inhabitants 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.140
 out 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.580
 To be able to work individually with the environment 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:55.740
 im sometimes 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.890
 it is no longer possible that we can interview them ourselves lift way 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.230
 illness-related canteens or so that's why we try something 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:05.470
 exaggerated 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.829
 came to find others enjoyed 

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:13.029
 sometimes that works fine because maybe no more relatives 

00:02:13.029 --> 00:02:15.259
 available 

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:18.599
 then moving biography work very hard because then we have to ourselves 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:21.010
 sit down and really every single step 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.819
 Watch local residents 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.810
 Find out how best to work with and how to best work with them 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.589
 can take care of 

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:33.039
 I wish you some with the people when I see him like him 

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:33.959
 I'm fine 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.290
 when I look at my well that I make my care important and that is 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.019
 That's what I learn I'm implementing. That's it 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:44.159
 It's actually what makes me brave every time to say yes also every one 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:47.359
 Rainwater the job 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:49.339
 we have block lessons 

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:51.329
 that means they have 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:54.729
 After a few weeks of school, two months later at work 

00:02:55.279 --> 00:02:58.900
 You have to keep watching that you learn what you learn at school but then 

00:02:58.899 --> 00:03:01.049
 but can implement 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.049
 "That's the least that refuses, which is not always possible 

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:06.459
 but good me 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.019
 It is only because you have so much to do with three exhibitions was very 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.429
 book quickly 

00:03:12.429 --> 00:03:15.639
 where are today with shift services, you have to be aware that you 

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:18.719
 Do not stop every weekend 3 1 to the end of every second 

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:21.169
 nameless 

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:22.429
 that one too 

00:03:22.429 --> 00:03:25.479
 he has to do night service again 

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:29.329
 But as I said one case is fun then all this can then be combined 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:32.449
 is not that bad 

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:36.529
 when I got off after training poor first two three years 

00:03:36.529 --> 00:03:38.889
 to work as a geriatric nurse 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:42.900
 and if everything works out the way I imagine I like to do it 

00:03:42.899 --> 00:03:44.919
 Make water around rice pipe 

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:48.519
 so that the crucial round pay back educations like 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.519
 Gallois for nursing management 

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:54.359
 the profession is very diverse 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:57.359
 Reminders can work very high up 

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:00.179
 and it will 

00:04:00.179 --> 00:04:03.849
 never boring because you learn new things every day 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:08.099
 In any case, be close with this profession again 

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:10.270
 This is 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.050
 Absolutely my thing and so I have three years and I hope that even 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.660
 no case
