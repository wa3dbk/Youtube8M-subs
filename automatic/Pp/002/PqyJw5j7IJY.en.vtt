 chorizo you say to me that coarse so no 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:19.220
 sir let's make some chickpeas with 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:22.609
 chorizo ​​but 2.0 we will take them to the 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:25.369
 modernity we will obviously use 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:27.470
 a few chickpeas of pot some slices of 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.939
 normal chorizo that you find in the 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.580
 super corner 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.230
 let's use tomato the tomato is going 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.960
 to give a point that you will see tomato 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:39.130
 natural cut slices and let's 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.630
 use arugula or in full currency 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.489
 culinary you will see what richer thing 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.280
 with a little garlic oil and others 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:48.260
 now I tell you the first thing we're going to 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.260
 to do is to light our wonderful 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:54.020
 natural gas kitchen once I already 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:57.199
 it's so cool and we're going to put an implement 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:00.010
 l'illa we put the pot on the fire 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:03.489
 we put a little oil 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:06.659
 we throw a few generous slices 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:09.580
 of chorizo we are going to fry it a little 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.820
 we give him a turn nothing that takes us 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:15.250
 color and we add 2-3 cloves of garlic 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.119
 cut into sheets you will see what a wonder 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.649
 when the garlic takes us this beautiful value 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:24.960
 doradillo we are going to add a touch 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:27.960
 secret a generous dribble of vinegar 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.299
 that does not evaporate a little bit we throw 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.330
 we raise the chickpeas a little 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.920
 fire look that half if it gives 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.290
 I like to see them and that is what I 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.470
 like is the analog fire not the fire 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.520
 digital what is that about the numbers that 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.520
 I think I see her and half 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.799
 we remove a little bit mix well and 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.990
 we left the chickpeas making here and 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.299
 stirring occasionally until 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.030
 begin to jump and threaten 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.430
 with taking out your eye, leaving you one-eyed or something 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.240
 of that what better if you avoid it because more 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:08.660
 that nothing bothers you we put two or three 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:12.340
 tomatoes cut into segments remove 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:15.819
 that they catch us a little color 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:20.230
 come very as it smells what a little rich 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:21.910
 of salt and we add a generous handful 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.510
 of arugula 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.730
 we stir well a heater and same to 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.980
 all recipes always in two 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.320
 minutes with the help of natural gas that 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.510
 he gives us a hand in the preparation of 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.940
 these videos and a humble boat site of 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.860
 We have made some chickpeas with 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.440
 chorizo ​​that are a pure scandal 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:45.160
 gastronomic modernity 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.160
 of such fact
