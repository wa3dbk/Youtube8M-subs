00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
finals now to me I might might be in the

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.890 
finals now to me I might might be in the
minority<00:00:11.000> apparently<00:00:12.000> everybody<00:00:12.300> loves<00:00:12.660> San

Antonio<00:00:13.410> in<00:00:13.590> this<00:00:13.830> series<00:00:14.099> everyone<00:00:15.089> loves

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
Antonio in this series everyone loves

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.960 
Antonio in this series everyone loves
them<00:00:15.480> as<00:00:15.630> early<00:00:15.929> as<00:00:16.020> Game<00:00:16.230> one<00:00:16.440> to<00:00:16.680> and<00:00:16.859> I<00:00:17.609> think

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
them as early as Game one to and I think

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.599 
them as early as Game one to and I think
that<00:00:18.449> to<00:00:18.869> me<00:00:19.020> I<00:00:19.230> like<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.800> Miami<00:00:20.160> Heat<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:20.400> the

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
that to me I like the Miami Heat and the

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.640 
that to me I like the Miami Heat and the
reasoning<00:00:21.060> is<00:00:21.240> quite<00:00:21.570> simple<00:00:21.990> I<00:00:22.140> watched<00:00:22.410> out

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
reasoning is quite simple I watched out

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.410 
reasoning is quite simple I watched out
the<00:00:22.769> Spurs<00:00:23.010> of<00:00:23.189> plays<00:00:23.430> I<00:00:23.730> watched<00:00:24.210> how<00:00:24.390> the

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
the Spurs of plays I watched how the

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.089 
the Spurs of plays I watched how the
heat<00:00:24.660> of<00:00:24.750> plate<00:00:24.990> and<00:00:25.019> there's<00:00:25.289> no<00:00:25.439> question<00:00:25.980> in

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
heat of plate and there's no question in

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.700 
heat of plate and there's no question in
my<00:00:26.130> mind<00:00:26.340> that<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.330> Heat<00:00:27.570> are<00:00:27.810> going<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.529> have

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
my mind that the Heat are going to have

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.490 
my mind that the Heat are going to have
to<00:00:28.859> match<00:00:29.099> that<00:00:29.460> sort<00:00:30.090> of<00:00:30.179> one<00:00:30.510> factor<00:00:31.140> for<00:00:31.470> the

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
to match that sort of one factor for the

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.700 
to match that sort of one factor for the
San<00:00:32.099> Antonio<00:00:32.309> Spurs<00:00:32.669> first<00:00:33.360> want<00:00:33.750> revenge<00:00:34.110> the

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
San Antonio Spurs first want revenge the

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:35.900 
San Antonio Spurs first want revenge the
Spurs<00:00:35.010> are<00:00:35.190> going<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.460> want<00:00:35.700> this

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
Spurs are going to want this

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.540 
Spurs are going to want this
championship<00:00:36.600> more<00:00:36.930> then<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.890> heat<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:38.280> at

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
championship more then the heat I at

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.850 
championship more then the heat I at
least<00:00:38.670> I<00:00:38.850> think<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:39.270> think<00:00:39.480> it's<00:00:39.600> hard<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:40.110> match

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
least I think I think it's hard to match

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.250 
least I think I think it's hard to match
that<00:00:40.890> hunger<00:00:41.730> from<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.570> Spurs<00:00:42.930> when<00:00:43.200> you

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
that hunger from the Spurs when you

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.229 
that hunger from the Spurs when you
consider<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:43.739> they<00:00:44.010> got<00:00:44.160> burned<00:00:44.640> last<00:00:44.910> year

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
consider that they got burned last year

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.389 
consider that they got burned last year
whereas<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.079> heat<00:00:46.289> of<00:00:46.440> now<00:00:46.590> on<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:47.039> straight

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
whereas the heat of now on to straight

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.639 
whereas the heat of now on to straight
button<00:00:47.610> you<00:00:48.329> know<00:00:48.480> there's<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.230> lot<00:00:49.410> of<00:00:49.440> other

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
button you know there's a lot of other

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.110 
button you know there's a lot of other
factors<00:00:49.950> that<00:00:50.280> are<00:00:50.340> going<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.579> balance<00:00:50.789> this

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
factors that are going to balance this

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.610 
factors that are going to balance this
out<00:00:51.329> i<00:00:51.390> think<00:00:51.719> this<00:00:51.809> is<00:00:51.989> really<00:00:52.170> one<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.469> those

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
out i think this is really one of those

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.950 
out i think this is really one of those
factors<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.309> looks<00:00:53.850> great<00:00:54.149> on<00:00:54.329> paper<00:00:54.570> well

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
factors that looks great on paper well

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.990 
factors that looks great on paper well
once<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.289> games<00:00:55.500> start<00:00:55.649> not<00:00:56.399> as<00:00:56.579> big<00:00:56.789> of<00:00:56.820> a

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
once the games start not as big of a

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.720 
once the games start not as big of a
factor<00:00:57.239> in<00:00:57.660> my<00:00:57.870> mud<00:00:58.170> what<00:00:58.440> i<00:00:58.469> mean<00:00:58.680> is<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:59.579> take

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
factor in my mud what i mean is you take

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.819 
factor in my mud what i mean is you take
a<00:00:59.760> look<00:01:00.000> at<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.149> Spurs<00:01:00.480> now<00:01:00.750> last<00:01:01.199> year<00:01:01.590> at

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
a look at the Spurs now last year at

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.920 
a look at the Spurs now last year at
this<00:01:02.070> point<00:01:02.399> in<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.670> playoffs<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.570> Spurs

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
this point in the playoffs the Spurs

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.899 
this point in the playoffs the Spurs
were<00:01:04.589> getting<00:01:04.920> more<00:01:05.100> points<00:01:05.460> per<00:01:05.580> game<00:01:05.610> from

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
were getting more points per game from

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.660 
were getting more points per game from
Tony<00:01:06.210> Parker<00:01:06.330> more<00:01:07.260> from<00:01:07.500> Tim<00:01:07.710> Duncan<00:01:08.189> more

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
Tony Parker more from Tim Duncan more

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.270 
Tony Parker more from Tim Duncan more
from<00:01:08.939> Kawhi<00:01:09.270> Leonard<00:01:09.750> more<00:01:10.260> from<00:01:10.530> Danny<00:01:10.799> Green

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
from Kawhi Leonard more from Danny Green

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.789 
from Kawhi Leonard more from Danny Green
you<00:01:12.270> know<00:01:12.390> that's<00:01:12.750> pretty<00:01:13.140> much<00:01:13.320> their<00:01:13.560> entire

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
you know that's pretty much their entire

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.460 
you know that's pretty much their entire
starting<00:01:14.280> cast<00:01:14.580> Manu<00:01:15.450> Ginobili<00:01:16.020> i<00:01:16.110> think<00:01:16.350> is

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
starting cast Manu Ginobili i think is

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.140 
starting cast Manu Ginobili i think is
the<00:01:16.590> one<00:01:16.799> player<00:01:17.130> that's<00:01:17.400> going<00:01:17.610> better<00:01:17.850> this

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
the one player that's going better this

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.810 
the one player that's going better this
postseason<00:01:18.659> last<00:01:19.140> year<00:01:19.380> but<00:01:20.310> we<00:01:20.400> take<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.640> look

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
postseason last year but we take a look

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.760 
postseason last year but we take a look
those<00:01:21.000> factors<00:01:21.570> all<00:01:21.930> those<00:01:22.259> guys<00:01:22.530> have

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
those factors all those guys have

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.170 
those factors all those guys have
dropped<00:01:23.070> off<00:01:23.250> now<00:01:23.460> that's<00:01:23.640> not<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.850> huge

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
dropped off now that's not a huge

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.850 
dropped off now that's not a huge
drop-off<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:24.869> consider<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.409> visitors

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
drop-off and you consider the visitors

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.590 
drop-off and you consider the visitors
you<00:01:26.549> know<00:01:26.670> they<00:01:26.790> haven't<00:01:26.939> fallen<00:01:27.270> off

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
you know they haven't fallen off

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.690 
you know they haven't fallen off
offensively<00:01:28.350> it's<00:01:28.560> more<00:01:28.710> of<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:28.890> rebalancing

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
offensively it's more of a rebalancing

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.550 
offensively it's more of a rebalancing
the<00:01:29.759> bench<00:01:30.150> now<00:01:30.390> contributes<00:01:30.990> maybe<00:01:31.259> a<00:01:31.380> little

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
the bench now contributes maybe a little

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.800 
the bench now contributes maybe a little
bit<00:01:31.770> more<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.070> might<00:01:32.220> say<00:01:32.520> but<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:33.479> think<00:01:33.689> it's

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
bit more you might say but I think it's

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.960 
bit more you might say but I think it's
a<00:01:33.930> big<00:01:34.079> issue<00:01:34.290> because<00:01:34.979> you're<00:01:35.549> not<00:01:35.670> getting

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
a big issue because you're not getting

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.719 
a big issue because you're not getting
as<00:01:36.090> much<00:01:36.119> from<00:01:36.479> your<00:01:36.659> stars<00:01:37.130> as<00:01:38.130> mentioned<00:01:38.579> to

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
as much from your stars as mentioned to

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.390 
as much from your stars as mentioned to
a<00:01:38.780> Duncan<00:01:39.780> Parker<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:40.829> remember<00:01:41.159> at<00:01:41.250> this

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
a Duncan Parker and remember at this
