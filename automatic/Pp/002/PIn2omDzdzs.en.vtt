goes from the center to the two top

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.710 
goes from the center to the two top
corners<00:00:50.810> has<00:00:51.590> adjustments<00:00:52.460> here<00:00:52.730> so<00:00:53.510> you<00:00:53.600> can

then on the back we've tied a balloon
what's<00:01:04.789> the<00:01:04.909> balloon<00:01:05.179> do<00:01:05.449> this<00:01:05.810> is<00:01:05.990> a<00:01:06.020> ten-cent

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
what's the balloon do this is a ten-cent

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:08.319 
what's the balloon do this is a ten-cent
life<00:01:06.770> jacket<00:01:07.280> kites<00:01:07.579> are<00:01:07.759> pretty<00:01:07.939> expensive

you can drive over and pick it up and

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.959 
you can drive over and pick it up and
not<00:01:17.210> even<00:01:17.420> strain<00:01:17.780> the<00:01:18.049> fact<00:01:18.289> that<00:01:18.969> graphite

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:19.969 
not even strain the fact that graphite

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:22.029 
not even strain the fact that graphite
sticks<00:01:20.299> it<00:01:20.479> could<00:01:20.630> break<00:01:20.840> so<00:01:21.649> it's<00:01:21.770> a<00:01:21.859> good

00:01:22.029 --> 00:01:22.039

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
further from the kite now when we let

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.400 
further from the kite now when we let
the<00:02:32.880> kite<00:02:33.120> out<00:02:33.150> we'll<00:02:33.540> put<00:02:33.720> our<00:02:33.840> fishing<00:02:34.230> line

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410

in here it'll start to take our bait
away<00:02:37.910> that's<00:02:38.910> usually<00:02:39.209> about<00:02:39.300> a<00:02:39.420> hundred<00:02:39.780> feet

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
away that's usually about a hundred feet

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.830 
away that's usually about a hundred feet
by<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.290> way<00:02:40.470> then<00:02:41.069> 70<00:02:41.790> feet<00:02:42.000> from<00:02:42.060> that<00:02:42.330> little

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
by the way then 70 feet from that little

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.080 
by the way then 70 feet from that little
swivel<00:02:43.280> we're<00:02:44.280> going<00:02:44.400> to<00:02:44.459> come<00:02:44.640> to<00:02:44.760> a<00:02:44.790> bigger

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
swivel we're going to come to a bigger

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:54.830 
swivel we're going to come to a bigger
swivel<00:02:52.880> see<00:02:53.880> this<00:02:54.060> slid<00:02:54.360> right<00:02:54.569> over<00:02:54.810> that

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
swivel see this slid right over that

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.440 
swivel see this slid right over that
other<00:02:55.110> swivel<00:02:55.610> when<00:02:56.610> we<00:02:56.730> come<00:02:56.940> to<00:02:57.030> this<00:02:57.180> next

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
other swivel when we come to this next

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.289 
other swivel when we come to this next
well<00:02:57.720> which<00:02:58.019> is<00:02:58.170> 70<00:02:58.560> feet<00:02:58.739> further<00:02:59.209> so<00:03:00.209> you

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
well which is 70 feet further so you

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:01.820 
well which is 70 feet further so you
have<00:03:00.420> a<00:03:00.480> nice<00:03:00.660> big<00:03:00.900> swivel<00:03:01.290> and<00:03:01.380> that<00:03:01.530> stops

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
have a nice big swivel and that stops

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.910 
have a nice big swivel and that stops
this<00:03:02.040> clip<00:03:02.510> so<00:03:03.510> we<00:03:03.630> can<00:03:03.750> put<00:03:03.900> a<00:03:03.930> bait<00:03:04.170> on<00:03:04.380> here

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
this clip so we can put a bait on here

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.770 
this clip so we can put a bait on here
and<00:03:05.670> then<00:03:05.819> we<00:03:05.910> can<00:03:06.030> let<00:03:06.120> it<00:03:06.269> out<00:03:06.360> again<00:03:06.660> and

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
and then we can let it out again and

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.229 
and then we can let it out again and
what<00:03:06.930> happens<00:03:07.350> is<00:03:07.590> our<00:03:07.850> fishing<00:03:08.850> line<00:03:09.030> from

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
what happens is our fishing line from

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.229 
what happens is our fishing line from
our<00:03:09.420> rod<00:03:09.630> comes<00:03:10.170> from<00:03:10.380> our<00:03:10.560> rod<00:03:10.799> to<00:03:11.730> this<00:03:11.880> wire

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
our rod comes from our rod to this wire

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.140 
our rod comes from our rod to this wire
and<00:03:12.570> then<00:03:12.900> down<00:03:13.170> to<00:03:13.200> the<00:03:13.440> water<00:03:13.790> we<00:03:14.790> can<00:03:14.940> take

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
and then down to the water we can take

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.460 
and then down to the water we can take
everything<00:03:15.540> and<00:03:15.690> pull<00:03:15.840> it<00:03:15.959> out<00:03:16.049> away<00:03:16.260> from<00:03:16.290> the

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
everything and pull it out away from the

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.690 
everything and pull it out away from the
boat<00:03:16.680> because<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:16.950> kites<00:03:17.250> going<00:03:17.489> to<00:03:17.549> pull

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
this away from the boat and we get it

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:21.590 
this away from the boat and we get it
out<00:03:19.980> there<00:03:20.160> where<00:03:20.310> we<00:03:20.459> want<00:03:20.730> it<00:03:20.880> by<00:03:21.209> adjusting
