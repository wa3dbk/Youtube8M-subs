00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:06.060
 So, we'll move on from here. 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:09.800
 the cooling system is made 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:12.450
 super hero for the digital abuses 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:16.139
 work with digital students directly 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.990
 so I have here the total system does not 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:24.060
 hesitation and growth of the vehicle when 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:25.289
 I play on the system appears other than 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.340
 motorization 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.679
 returning to the circuit, only one touch is 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.000
 I have an expansion report for this 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:38.660
 report shows 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.500
 oxidation of the engine itself 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:48.480
 I have here the operating stage 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:53.760
 total knowledge of it at the exit of the 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:57.510
 reservoir leaving its own 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:02.129
 thermostatic valve 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:04.760
 inside the unit and disassemble the 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:09.990
 electric fan and said own 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:13.950
 circuit and a butterfly sensor 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.580
 heated sensor leads the butterfly ' 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.580
 heated 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:23.200
 Here there now I will show you one 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.899
 another animation and was also made for 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.009
 working with digital sensor board 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:30.039
 temperature 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:33.189
 here we have a heated temperature 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:36.479
 and switching the engine to the 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:38.830
 radiator doing the cooling 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.880
 consequently the temperature in this 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.220
 space 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.429
 It will start to work and cool down. 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:49.000
 radiator when it cools or 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:51.759
 closing and closing the match using the 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.149
 radiator back if it works for the engine 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:58.539
 the engine warms up the ball 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:00.789
 happening it will again open going 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:03.880
 for the alderman and his so-called circuit 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:06.099
 this function of the ball has a stadium 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.399
 I'll show your total 

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:12.849
 operation of the engine in 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:16.540
 working and total combustion does not 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:19.860
 here the internal combustion and the water being 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.570
 heated to the electric fan 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.359
 electrically player makes the radiator 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:28.209
 cooling water returns to the engine 

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:31.650
 and thus becomes a cycle of 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.650
 engine cooling
