time that we live and that's what makes
it<00:03:24.930> so<00:03:25.170> exciting<00:03:26.010> and<00:03:26.310> fascinating<00:03:26.549> that<00:03:26.910> it

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
it so exciting and fascinating that it

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.059 
it so exciting and fascinating that it
is<00:03:27.150> about<00:03:27.329> our<00:03:27.510> time<00:03:27.780> but<00:03:28.410> our<00:03:28.530> time<00:03:28.769> is<00:03:28.920> no

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
is about our time but our time is no

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:31.309 
is about our time but our time is no
longer<00:03:29.100> just<00:03:29.670> about<00:03:29.730> the<00:03:29.940> commodity<00:03:30.209> art<00:03:30.690> and

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
longer just about the commodity art and

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:32.630 
longer just about the commodity art and
our<00:03:31.410> time<00:03:31.590> there's<00:03:31.769> no<00:03:31.859> longer<00:03:32.100> just<00:03:32.459> about

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
our time there's no longer just about

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.220 
our time there's no longer just about
the<00:03:32.790> art<00:03:32.940> that's<00:03:33.060> made<00:03:33.239> in<00:03:33.390> foundries<00:03:33.870> and

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
the art that's made in foundries and

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.199 
the art that's made in foundries and
that<00:03:34.859> its<00:03:35.010> values<00:03:35.519> only<00:03:35.760> because<00:03:36.000> it<00:03:36.120> would

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
that its values only because it would

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.930 
that its values only because it would
make<00:03:36.359> 22<00:03:36.900> million<00:03:37.200> at<00:03:37.319> auction<00:03:37.440> and<00:03:37.980> I<00:03:38.700> think

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
make 22 million at auction and I think

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.910 
make 22 million at auction and I think
that<00:03:39.090> people<00:03:39.420> and<00:03:39.900> there's<00:03:40.319> young<00:03:40.500> people

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
that people and there's young people

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.170 
that people and there's young people
were<00:03:41.010> really<00:03:41.280> hungry<00:03:41.400> for<00:03:41.670> something<00:03:41.910> else

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
were really hungry for something else

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.300 
were really hungry for something else
and<00:03:42.600> they're<00:03:43.049> hungry<00:03:43.200> good<00:03:43.470> for<00:03:43.620> poetry<00:03:44.040> and

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
and they're hungry good for poetry and

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.430 
and they're hungry good for poetry and
for<00:03:44.519> authenticity<00:03:44.790> and<00:03:45.630> for<00:03:45.900> work<00:03:46.049> that's<00:03:46.290> not

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
for authenticity and for work that's not

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.170 
for authenticity and for work that's not
being<00:03:46.709> made<00:03:46.920> just<00:03:47.250> because<00:03:47.400> it's<00:03:47.880> going<00:03:48.060> to

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
being made just because it's going to

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.330 
being made just because it's going to
fetch<00:03:48.959> a<00:03:49.200> really<00:03:49.500> high<00:03:49.650> price<00:03:49.920> and<00:03:50.069> make<00:03:50.190> them

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
fetch a really high price and make them

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.520 
fetch a really high price and make them
