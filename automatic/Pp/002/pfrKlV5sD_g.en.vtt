the<00:01:03.899> sticks<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.409> think<00:01:04.650> we<00:01:05.220> used<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.580> go<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.000> the

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
the sticks I think we used to go to the

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.690 
the sticks I think we used to go to the
gas<00:01:06.330> station<00:01:06.360> grab<00:01:06.930> $10<00:01:07.380> just<00:01:07.979> crappy<00:01:08.460> sticks

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
gas station grab $10 just crappy sticks

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.429 
gas station grab $10 just crappy sticks
out<00:01:08.850> of<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:09.000> barrel<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.540> go<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.140> rink<00:01:10.320> and

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
out of a barrel and go to the rink and

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.260 
out of a barrel and go to the rink and
use<00:01:10.590> them<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:10.920> now<00:01:11.010> kids<00:01:11.430> are<00:01:11.520> using<00:01:11.670> $200

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
use them and now kids are using $200

graphite<00:01:12.840> sticks<00:01:13.409> it's<00:01:13.560> pretty<00:01:13.710> crazy<00:01:14.060> so

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
graphite sticks it's pretty crazy so

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.090 
graphite sticks it's pretty crazy so
what<00:01:15.210> do<00:01:15.270> you<00:01:15.330> think<00:01:15.540> big<00:01:16.500> difference<00:01:16.860> between

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.920 

now<00:01:20.100> it's<00:01:20.310> time<00:01:20.580> for<00:01:20.610> Sean<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.360> get<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.689> puck

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
now it's time for Sean to get the puck

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.350 
now it's time for Sean to get the puck
out<00:01:22.080> of<00:01:22.140> here<00:01:22.500> in<00:01:22.860> two<00:01:23.280> tests<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:24.210> will

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
out of here in two tests that will

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.510 
out of here in two tests that will
settle<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:25.110> age-old<00:01:25.680> sports<00:01:26.250> bar

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
settle the age-old sports bar

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.179 
settle the age-old sports bar
controversy<00:01:27.299> which<00:01:27.840> is<00:01:28.049> better<00:01:28.259> wood<00:01:28.860> or

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
controversy which is better wood or

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.120 
controversy which is better wood or
graphite<00:01:29.939> I'm<00:01:30.750> hoping<00:01:31.290> that<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.590> composites

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
graphite I'm hoping that the composites

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.069 
graphite I'm hoping that the composites
way<00:01:32.610> more<00:01:32.880> effective<00:01:33.270> because<00:01:33.689> I<00:01:33.810> switched

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
way more effective because I switched

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.390 
way more effective because I switched
over<00:01:34.200> years<00:01:34.470> ago<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:34.860> they're<00:01:35.009> pretty<00:01:35.250> hard

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
over years ago and they're pretty hard

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.010 
over years ago and they're pretty hard
to<00:01:35.490> find<00:01:35.640> wood<00:01:35.880> sticks<00:01:36.180> nowadays<00:01:36.570> so<00:01:36.900> why

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
to find wood sticks nowadays so why

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.120 
to find wood sticks nowadays so why
don't<00:01:37.140> we<00:01:37.170> get<00:01:37.350> started<00:01:37.439> with<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.770> wood<00:01:37.920> one

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
don't we get started with the wood one

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.460 
don't we get started with the wood one
work<00:01:38.759> our<00:01:38.939> way<00:01:39.030> up<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.360> modern<00:01:39.570> science<00:01:40.079> it

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
work our way up to the modern science it

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.240 
work our way up to the modern science it

can<00:02:13.590> get<00:02:13.800> your<00:02:13.950> disciple<00:02:19.849> let's<00:02:20.849> watch<00:02:21.090> the

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
can get your disciple let's watch the

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:37.570 
can get your disciple let's watch the
graphite<00:02:22.050> stick

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.130 

Wow<00:02:38.610> can<00:02:38.910> we<00:02:39.000> go<00:02:39.120> back<00:02:39.240> actually<00:02:39.510> that<00:02:39.900> your

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
Wow can we go back actually that your

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.440 
Wow can we go back actually that your
contact<00:02:40.950> point<00:02:41.280> just<00:02:42.000> for<00:02:42.120> meeting<00:02:42.360> the

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
contact point just for meeting the

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.090 
contact point just for meeting the
ground<00:02:42.660> there's<00:02:42.840> a<00:02:42.930> huge<00:02:43.290> amount<00:02:43.470> of<00:02:43.620> drag<00:02:43.860> but

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
ground there's a huge amount of drag but

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.530 
ground there's a huge amount of drag but
when<00:02:44.250> you<00:02:44.370> make<00:02:44.550> contact<00:02:44.790> with<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.270> puck

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
when you make contact with the puck

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.540 
when you make contact with the puck
there's<00:02:46.140> this<00:02:46.290> great<00:02:46.710> shock<00:02:47.040> wave<00:02:47.280> comes

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
there's this great shock wave comes

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.600 
there's this great shock wave comes
right<00:02:47.850> up<00:02:48.000> and<00:02:48.150> twists<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:48.600> whole<00:02:48.780> thing

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
right up and twists the whole thing

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
right up and twists the whole thing
that's<00:02:50.610> taken<00:02:50.970> about<00:02:51.150> less<00:02:51.420> than<00:02:51.450> a

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
that's taken about less than a

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:52.970 
that's taken about less than a
thousandth<00:02:52.050> of<00:02:52.080> a<00:02:52.140> second<00:02:52.530> to<00:02:52.620> get<00:02:52.770> through

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
thousandth of a second to get through

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.340 
thousandth of a second to get through
that's<00:02:53.940> a<00:02:54.090> tremendous<00:02:54.660> amount<00:02:54.930> of<00:02:55.020> bend<00:02:55.230> in

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
that's a tremendous amount of bend in

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.140 
that's a tremendous amount of bend in
that<00:02:55.380> stick<00:02:55.740> to<00:02:55.980> it<00:02:56.190> right<00:02:56.430> at<00:02:56.550> that<00:02:56.670> point<00:02:56.730> you

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
that stick to it right at that point you

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.250 
that stick to it right at that point you
know<00:02:57.240> right<00:02:57.450> before<00:02:57.570> it<00:02:57.780> leaves<00:02:57.930> the<00:02:58.080> ground

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
know right before it leaves the ground

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.530 
know right before it leaves the ground
now<00:02:59.100> let's<00:02:59.520> walk<00:02:59.730> the<00:03:00.150> wood<00:03:00.360> stick<00:03:02.540> you're

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
now let's walk the wood stick you're

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.530 
now let's walk the wood stick you're
pretty<00:03:03.810> consistent<00:03:04.380> I<00:03:04.440> would<00:03:04.620> say<00:03:04.800> that's

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
pretty consistent I would say that's

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.780 
pretty consistent I would say that's
pretty<00:03:06.540> much<00:03:06.630> the<00:03:06.780> exact<00:03:07.080> same<00:03:07.290> place<00:03:07.790> when

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
pretty much the exact same place when

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.280 
pretty much the exact same place when
you<00:03:08.880> take<00:03:09.090> this<00:03:09.210> slap<00:03:09.480> shot<00:03:09.720> with<00:03:09.960> a<00:03:09.990> wood

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
you take this slap shot with a wood

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.660 
you take this slap shot with a wood
stick<00:03:10.530> you<00:03:10.860> know<00:03:10.980> how<00:03:11.100> is<00:03:11.220> it<00:03:11.250> different<00:03:11.430> from

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
stick you know how is it different from

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.040 
stick you know how is it different from
your<00:03:11.880> normal<00:03:11.970> composite<00:03:12.540> woods<00:03:12.840> a<00:03:12.930> lot

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
your normal composite woods a lot

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.630 
your normal composite woods a lot
heavier<00:03:13.440> in<00:03:13.560> my<00:03:13.650> hands<00:03:13.860> that's<00:03:14.070> the<00:03:14.160> only

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
heavier in my hands that's the only

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.860 
heavier in my hands that's the only
difference<00:03:14.850> I<00:03:15.090> mean<00:03:15.210> I<00:03:15.270> haven't<00:03:15.510> used<00:03:15.630> a<00:03:15.720> wood

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
difference I mean I haven't used a wood

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.900 
difference I mean I haven't used a wood
stick<00:03:16.080> in<00:03:16.260> years<00:03:16.710> so<00:03:16.950> I<00:03:16.980> can't<00:03:17.430> really<00:03:17.520> do<00:03:17.790> the

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
stick in years so I can't really do the

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.250 
stick in years so I can't really do the
comparison<00:03:18.450> those<00:03:18.570> first<00:03:18.840> time<00:03:19.020> in<00:03:19.110> a<00:03:19.170> long

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
comparison those first time in a long

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.320 
comparison those first time in a long
time<00:03:19.470> but<00:03:19.740> I<00:03:19.890> know<00:03:19.950> pause<00:03:20.640> it's<00:03:20.850> a<00:03:20.880> lot<00:03:21.030> lighter

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
time but I know pause it's a lot lighter

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:22.880 
time but I know pause it's a lot lighter
it<00:03:21.570> looks<00:03:21.750> really<00:03:21.930> similar<00:03:22.290> and<00:03:22.560> it's<00:03:22.680> still

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
it looks really similar and it's still

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.770 
it looks really similar and it's still
taking<00:03:23.220> about<00:03:23.310> 11<00:03:23.760> or<00:03:23.820> 12<00:03:23.880> frames<00:03:24.450> to<00:03:24.690> get

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
taking about 11 or 12 frames to get

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.510 
taking about 11 or 12 frames to get
across<00:03:25.080> that<00:03:25.140> one<00:03:25.560> foot<00:03:25.860> so<00:03:26.070> we're<00:03:26.190> looking<00:03:26.430> at

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
across that one foot so we're looking at

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.040 
across that one foot so we're looking at
almost<00:03:26.730> exactly<00:03:26.910> the<00:03:27.390> same<00:03:27.420> speed<00:03:27.870> between

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
almost exactly the same speed between

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.660 
almost exactly the same speed between
the<00:03:28.290> sticks<00:03:28.560> so<00:03:29.270> wood<00:03:30.270> or<00:03:30.900> graphite<00:03:31.530> as<00:03:32.310> this

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
the sticks so wood or graphite as this

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.630 
the sticks so wood or graphite as this
side-by-side<00:03:33.380> comparison<00:03:34.380> shows<00:03:34.650> they<00:03:35.310> both

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
side-by-side comparison shows they both

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.180 
side-by-side comparison shows they both
get<00:03:35.970> the<00:03:36.030> puck<00:03:36.330> going<00:03:36.810> at<00:03:37.020> this<00:03:37.200> same<00:03:37.620> rate<00:03:38.070> of

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
get the puck going at this same rate of

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.230 
get the puck going at this same rate of
speed<00:03:40.220> maybe<00:03:41.220> I<00:03:41.310> should<00:03:41.490> switch<00:03:41.610> back<00:03:41.940> to<00:03:41.970> live

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.240 
speed maybe I should switch back to live

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.940 
speed maybe I should switch back to live
then<00:03:42.420> huh<00:03:42.570> well<00:03:43.170> I<00:03:43.230> mean<00:03:43.350> it<00:03:43.470> seems<00:03:43.680> like<00:03:43.830> the

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
then huh well I mean it seems like the

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.380 
then huh well I mean it seems like the
big<00:03:44.130> difference<00:03:44.490> is<00:03:44.610> that<00:03:44.640> wood<00:03:45.060> is<00:03:45.180> gonna

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
big difference is that wood is gonna

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:46.910 
big difference is that wood is gonna
bend<00:03:45.600> over<00:03:45.750> time<00:03:46.110> you're<00:03:46.470> gonna<00:03:46.530> have<00:03:46.650> these

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
bend over time you're gonna have these

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.130 
bend over time you're gonna have these
stress<00:03:47.280> fractures<00:03:47.790> that<00:03:47.910> form<00:03:48.180> inside<00:03:48.450> it<00:03:48.660> you

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
stress fractures that form inside it you

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.510 
stress fractures that form inside it you
know<00:03:49.230> they<00:03:49.350> probably<00:03:49.470> make<00:03:49.770> composites<00:03:50.310> not

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
know they probably make composites not

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.100 
know they probably make composites not
just<00:03:51.000> for<00:03:51.120> the<00:03:51.180> speed<00:03:51.420> but<00:03:51.720> for<00:03:51.840> the<00:03:51.900> fact<00:03:52.080> that

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
just for the speed but for the fact that

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.060 
just for the speed but for the fact that
you're<00:03:52.260> gonna<00:03:52.380> need<00:03:52.500> to<00:03:52.590> be<00:03:52.650> able<00:03:52.710> to<00:03:52.830> use<00:03:52.950> it

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
you're gonna need to be able to use it

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.520 
you're gonna need to be able to use it
for<00:03:53.160> a<00:03:53.220> much<00:03:53.340> longer<00:03:53.520> time<00:03:53.960> whether<00:03:54.960> wood<00:03:55.290> or

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
for a much longer time whether wood or

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.250 
for a much longer time whether wood or
composite<00:03:56.130> mat<00:03:56.460> is<00:03:56.790> not<00:03:56.850> going<00:03:57.660> to<00:03:57.780> pass<00:03:58.050> up

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
composite mat is not going to pass up

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.490 
composite mat is not going to pass up
his<00:03:58.470> shot<00:03:58.770> at<00:03:59.160> a<00:03:59.220> lifelong<00:04:00.030> fantasy<00:04:00.780> playing

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
his shot at a lifelong fantasy playing

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.590 
his shot at a lifelong fantasy playing
with<00:04:01.800> the<00:04:01.920> pros

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:11.890 

all<00:04:05.780> right<00:04:05.990> oh<00:04:09.670> well<00:04:10.670> celebrity<00:04:11.570> aside

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
all right oh well celebrity aside

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.810 
all right oh well celebrity aside
there's<00:04:12.590> just<00:04:12.770> nothing<00:04:13.160> like<00:04:13.280> playing<00:04:13.640> with

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820 
there's just nothing like playing with

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.690 
there's just nothing like playing with
your<00:04:13.940> own<00:04:14.000> pounds
