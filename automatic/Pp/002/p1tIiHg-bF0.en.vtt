00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:23.380
 today in gallery nights tv dino bruzzone 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:25.770
 invites us to take a walk for his 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.770
 study 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:36.070
 I am said olson is a plastic artist 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.710
 I work with models and photographs of 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.950
 the models and good for the first 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:44.860
 scene we go to lens 24 I think what 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.890
 that converts a photo into a work of 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.890
 art 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:56.560
 is the idea the concept that has that 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.560
 picture the work that is behind 

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:14.250
 for the next scene we go to the lens 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:16.260
 number 50 what I'm interested in portraying 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.550
 comes from a bit of the faculty of 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.370
 architecture when we did the 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:23.940
 exercise of photography the models 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:26.130
 to bring that possible space closer to 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.770
 the reality so that the viewer what 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.390
 see as a real object basically that 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.070
 it is repeated in all my works what I 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.460
 interesting when portraying is the possibility 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.080
 that has that space to be real like that 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.240
 as an anecdote what happened to me was with the 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.430
 of x the model of x that bought it on 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.700
 museum nation of fine arts came out in 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.700
 the newspapers 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.790
 I do not know how it was one day my name is 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.380
 manager for a contact that there was the 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.330
 We had wine with the workshop 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.760
 we were drinking beers saw the works 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.160
 he left, he sent me autographed the 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.850
 photos of the kits so I think that 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.470
 It is a good a good story because 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.320
 the kits managed to enter a museum of 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.659
 art thanks to a model that I made 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.500
 then for the next take we go to 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:13.709
 125 lens as a dream and I wish I could 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.520
 specify all those ideas that I'm going 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:20.750
 having to sometimes 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:23.600
 come new ideas and follow all the 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.850
 life that we can say now 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.370
 I have a project that's pretty big and 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.380
 the immediate dream is to realize it 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.590
 quite difficult but I think it is 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.590
 possible 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.640
 well ready thank you for coming to the workshop 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.340
 I hope that 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.690
 and have contributed to the understanding of 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.690
 contemporary art 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.720

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.990

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:55.290
