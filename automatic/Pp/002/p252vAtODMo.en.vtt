00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
now I have to be honest with me I ended

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.170 
now I have to be honest with me I ended
up<00:01:00.690> quitting<00:01:01.020> out<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.530> this<00:01:01.649> game<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:03.059> was

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
up quitting out of this game and it was

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.270 
up quitting out of this game and it was
because<00:01:03.539> of<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.750> lack<00:01:03.989> you<00:01:04.439> can<00:01:04.860> kind<00:01:05.129> of<00:01:05.220> see

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
because of the lack you can kind of see

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.130 
because of the lack you can kind of see
it<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.549> little<00:01:05.670> bit<00:01:05.880> here<00:01:06.270> but<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.810> was<00:01:06.930> more<00:01:07.080> so

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
it a little bit here but it was more so

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.780 
it a little bit here but it was more so
when<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.650> ball<00:01:07.830> was<00:01:07.979> actually<00:01:08.430> there<00:01:08.610> so

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
when the ball was actually there so

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.910 
when the ball was actually there so
maybe<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.119> was<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.270> blessing<00:01:09.510> in<00:01:09.810> disguise<00:01:09.920> but

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
maybe it was a blessing in disguise but

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.280 
maybe it was a blessing in disguise but

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.300 
really weird you can't reach in four
steals<00:02:59.200> if<00:02:59.380> you<00:02:59.470> do<00:02:59.620> you<00:02:59.770> don't<00:02:59.920> know<00:03:00.040> what<00:03:00.220> the

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
steals if you do you don't know what the

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.280 
ball is there or not and shooting jump
shots<00:03:02.950> becomes<00:03:03.490> a<00:03:03.580> challenge<00:03:03.820> so<00:03:04.260> what<00:03:05.260> I

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
shots becomes a challenge so what I

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:06.990 
shots becomes a challenge so what I
decided<00:03:05.440> to<00:03:05.800> do<00:03:05.980> is<00:03:06.100> just<00:03:06.250> drive<00:03:06.610> into<00:03:06.880> the

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
decided to do is just drive into the
