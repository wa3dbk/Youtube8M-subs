out<00:00:04.350> the<00:00:04.500> berkey<00:00:04.799> water<00:00:04.830> filters<00:00:05.490> we're<00:00:06.270> going

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
out the berkey water filters we're going

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:07.820 
out the berkey water filters we're going
to<00:00:06.450> do<00:00:06.509> a<00:00:06.540> little<00:00:06.810> bit<00:00:06.930> of<00:00:07.020> a<00:00:07.080> comparison<00:00:07.529> here

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
to do a little bit of a comparison here

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.410 
to do a little bit of a comparison here
between<00:00:08.010> the<00:00:08.250> Berkey<00:00:08.610> and<00:00:08.820> the<00:00:08.940> Zen<00:00:09.150> water

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
between the Berkey and the Zen water

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.480 
between the Berkey and the Zen water
filter<00:00:09.900> there<00:00:10.200> are<00:00:10.260> two<00:00:10.380> very<00:00:10.620> popular<00:00:10.860> brands

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
filter there are two very popular brands

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.230 
filter there are two very popular brands
on<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.639> market

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
on the market

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.079 
on the market
as<00:00:12.929> you<00:00:13.290> see<00:00:13.500> I<00:00:13.710> have<00:00:13.950> both<00:00:14.219> in<00:00:14.400> my<00:00:14.580> home<00:00:14.849> and

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
as you see I have both in my home and

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.900 
as you see I have both in my home and
I've<00:00:15.719> just<00:00:16.049> done<00:00:16.949> a<00:00:16.980> little<00:00:17.250> bit<00:00:17.490> of<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.670> taste

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
I've just done a little bit of a taste

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.689 
I've just done a little bit of a taste
test<00:00:18.240> between<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.750> two<00:00:19.050> my<00:00:19.920> son<00:00:20.160> also<00:00:20.369> did

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
test between the two my son also did

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.550 
test between the two my son also did
that<00:00:20.880> and<00:00:20.970> then<00:00:21.060> I<00:00:21.090> had<00:00:21.300> them<00:00:21.359> taste<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.990> the

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
that and then I had them taste the the

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.109 
that and then I had them taste the the
tap<00:00:22.740> water<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.310> he<00:00:23.430> said<00:00:23.640> it<00:00:23.760> tastes<00:00:24.060> like

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
tap water and he said it tastes like

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.689 
tap water and he said it tastes like
metal<00:00:24.449> so<00:00:25.230> good<00:00:25.740> news<00:00:25.890> is<00:00:26.130> both<00:00:26.340> of<00:00:26.550> these

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
metal so good news is both of these

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.220 
metal so good news is both of these
filters<00:00:27.000> really<00:00:27.660> get<00:00:27.960> out<00:00:28.109> all<00:00:28.320> those<00:00:28.910> I<00:00:30.230> don't

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
filters really get out all those I don't

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.799 
filters really get out all those I don't
know<00:00:31.289> heavy<00:00:31.619> metals<00:00:32.070> or<00:00:32.600> pollutants<00:00:33.600> that<00:00:33.690> are

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
know heavy metals or pollutants that are

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.660 
know heavy metals or pollutants that are
in<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.079> tap<00:00:34.260> water<00:00:34.290> I<00:00:34.770> know<00:00:34.890> it's<00:00:35.160> safe<00:00:35.430> to

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
in the tap water I know it's safe to

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.979 
in the tap water I know it's safe to
drink<00:00:35.790> but<00:00:35.969> it<00:00:36.180> certainly<00:00:36.450> doesn't<00:00:36.690> taste

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
drink but it certainly doesn't taste

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.150 
drink but it certainly doesn't taste
good<00:00:37.290> anyway

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
good anyway

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.030 
good anyway
so<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.510> berkey<00:00:39.870> water<00:00:39.899> filter<00:00:40.500> is<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.620> great

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
so the berkey water filter is a great

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.389 
so the berkey water filter is a great
filter<00:00:41.550> for<00:00:42.290> daily<00:00:43.290> use<00:00:43.500> as<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:43.860> see<00:00:44.070> it's<00:00:44.219> got

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
filter for daily use as you see it's got

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.729 
filter for daily use as you see it's got
a<00:00:44.430> really<00:00:44.670> nice<00:00:44.910> form<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:45.660> as<00:00:45.780> does<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.559> Zen

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
a really nice form to it as does the Zen

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.670 
a really nice form to it as does the Zen
water<00:00:47.010> filter<00:00:47.570> they<00:00:48.570> both<00:00:48.780> have<00:00:49.020> spigots<00:00:49.530> on

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
water filter they both have spigots on

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.920 
water filter they both have spigots on
it<00:00:49.890> they<00:00:50.010> both<00:00:50.219> have<00:00:50.550> you<00:00:51.270> know<00:00:51.360> containers

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
it they both have you know containers

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.650 
it they both have you know containers
you<00:00:52.079> put<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.440> tap<00:00:53.399> water<00:00:53.670> or<00:00:53.760> dirty<00:00:54.210> water<00:00:54.480> up

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
you put the tap water or dirty water up

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.340 
you put the tap water or dirty water up
top<00:00:56.059> the<00:00:57.059> main<00:00:57.239> differences<00:00:57.780> are<00:00:57.989> that<00:00:58.020> the

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
top the main differences are that the

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.069 
top the main differences are that the
Zen<00:00:58.530> water<00:00:58.800> filter<00:00:59.190> is<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.309> ceramic<00:01:00.000> filter<00:01:00.449> the

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
Zen water filter is a ceramic filter the

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.880 
Zen water filter is a ceramic filter the
Berkey<00:01:01.500> has<00:01:01.820> let<00:01:02.820> me<00:01:02.910> flip<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.329> here<00:01:03.600> -<00:01:04.559> black

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
Berkey has let me flip it here - black

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.370 
Berkey has let me flip it here - black
filters<00:01:05.430> here<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.030> they're<00:01:06.510> not<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.840> ceramic

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
filters here and they're not the ceramic

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.190 
filters here and they're not the ceramic
filters<00:01:07.770> they're<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:07.950> special<00:01:08.220> type<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.610> filter

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
filters they're a special type of filter

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.500 
filters they're a special type of filter
specific<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.290> Berkey<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:10.920> they<00:01:11.909> essentially

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
specific to Berkey and they essentially

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.719 
specific to Berkey and they essentially
filter<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.140> water<00:01:13.320> so<00:01:13.619> much<00:01:13.770> faster<00:01:14.250> not<00:01:14.460> only

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
filter the water so much faster not only

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.210 
filter the water so much faster not only
do<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:14.939> have<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.570> different<00:01:16.320> type<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:16.710> media

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
do you have a different type of media

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.770 
do you have a different type of media
that<00:01:17.280> lets<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.820> water<00:01:18.000> go<00:01:18.180> through<00:01:18.210> faster

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
that lets the water go through faster

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.140 
that lets the water go through faster
but<00:01:18.960> you've<00:01:19.080> also<00:01:19.259> got<00:01:19.560> two<00:01:19.770> two<00:01:20.400> filters<00:01:20.880> and

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
but you've also got two two filters and

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.480 
but you've also got two two filters and
two<00:01:21.360> entry<00:01:21.720> points<00:01:22.110> I<00:01:22.259> will<00:01:22.920> tell<00:01:23.159> you<00:01:23.310> from

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
two entry points I will tell you from

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.450 
two entry points I will tell you from
using<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.939> Zen<00:01:24.180> in<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.540> ceramic<00:01:24.990> filter<00:01:25.460> it

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
using the Zen in the ceramic filter it

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.690 
using the Zen in the ceramic filter it
is<00:01:26.970> so<00:01:27.420> slow<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:28.170> will<00:01:28.500> fill<00:01:28.770> up<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.070> top<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.579> a

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
is so slow I will fill up the top and a

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.730 
is so slow I will fill up the top and a
day<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.060> half<00:01:30.210> later<00:01:30.509> it's<00:01:31.170> still<00:01:31.560> not

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
day and a half later it's still not

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.170 
day and a half later it's still not
completely<00:01:32.490> empty<00:01:33.619> so<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:35.460> water<00:01:35.729> tastes

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
completely empty so the water tastes

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.460 
completely empty so the water tastes
great<00:01:36.360> in<00:01:36.630> both<00:01:37.280> the<00:01:38.280> water<00:01:38.520> clarity<00:01:38.850> is<00:01:39.119> great

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
great in both the water clarity is great

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.399 
great in both the water clarity is great
a<00:01:40.470> company<00:01:41.159> called<00:01:41.400> natural<00:01:41.939> news.com<00:01:42.840> did<00:01:43.350> a

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
a company called natural news.com did a

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.200 
a company called natural news.com did a
testing<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.040> ten<00:01:44.280> different<00:01:44.460> water<00:01:44.820> filters

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
testing of ten different water filters

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.789 
testing of ten different water filters
and<00:01:45.390> these<00:01:45.479> were<00:01:45.659> actually<00:01:45.840> number<00:01:46.290> one<00:01:46.320> and

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
and these were actually number one and

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.609 
and these were actually number one and
number<00:01:47.159> two<00:01:47.310> in<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:48.060> rankings<00:01:48.540> as<00:01:48.720> far<00:01:48.960> as<00:01:49.200> the

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
number two in the rankings as far as the

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.380 
number two in the rankings as far as the
water<00:01:49.829> clarity<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.490> they<00:01:50.850> actually<00:01:51.030> have<00:01:51.360> a

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
water clarity and they actually have a

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.870 
water clarity and they actually have a
laboratory<00:01:52.020> where<00:01:52.979> they<00:01:53.040> tested<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.670> water

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
laboratory where they tested the water

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.780 
laboratory where they tested the water
before<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.540> after<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.170> again<00:01:55.740> Berkey<00:01:56.579> came

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
before and after and again Berkey came

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.940 
before and after and again Berkey came
in<00:01:56.939> number<00:01:57.090> one<00:01:57.270> as<00:01:57.750> far<00:01:57.810> as<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.439> purity<00:01:58.920> of

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
in number one as far as the purity of

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.160 
in number one as far as the purity of
the<00:01:59.130> water<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.909> Zen<00:02:00.210> came<00:02:00.479> in<00:02:00.630> number<00:02:00.930> two

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
the water the Zen came in number two

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.859 
the water the Zen came in number two
again<00:02:01.860> I've<00:02:02.219> got<00:02:02.430> them<00:02:02.640> both<00:02:02.850> but<00:02:03.270> my<00:02:03.570> go-to

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
again I've got them both but my go-to

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.899 
again I've got them both but my go-to
filter<00:02:04.380> is<00:02:04.649> definitely<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.219> Berkey<00:02:05.579> because

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
filter is definitely the Berkey because

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.820 
filter is definitely the Berkey because
it<00:02:06.060> filters<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.570> water<00:02:06.600> so<00:02:07.170> much<00:02:07.409> faster<00:02:09.830> the

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
it filters the water so much faster the

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.030 
it filters the water so much faster the
Zen<00:02:11.730> also<00:02:12.300> has

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
Zen also has

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.920 
Zen also has
two<00:02:13.310> different<00:02:13.640> types<00:02:13.879> of<00:02:14.090> media<00:02:14.299> you'll<00:02:14.689> see

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
two different types of media you'll see

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.140 
two different types of media you'll see
down<00:02:15.140> on<00:02:15.170> the<00:02:15.379> bottom<00:02:15.560> there's<00:02:16.150> several

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
down on the bottom there's several

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.670 
down on the bottom there's several
different<00:02:17.269> types<00:02:17.719> of<00:02:17.900> media<00:02:18.049> that<00:02:18.349> it<00:02:18.469> filters

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
different types of media that it filters

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.550 
different types of media that it filters
through<00:02:19.480> again<00:02:20.480> it<00:02:20.599> does<00:02:20.750> a<00:02:20.780> nice<00:02:20.959> job<00:02:21.019> but

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
through again it does a nice job but

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.890 
through again it does a nice job but
it's<00:02:21.680> just<00:02:22.010> so<00:02:22.430> slow<00:02:22.849> so<00:02:22.879> if<00:02:23.209> I<00:02:23.299> have<00:02:23.480> company

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
it's just so slow so if I have company

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.479 
it's just so slow so if I have company
over<00:02:24.260> we<00:02:24.439> go<00:02:24.590> through<00:02:24.799> the<00:02:24.920> water<00:02:25.099> and<00:02:25.250> then<00:02:25.370> we

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
over we go through the water and then we

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:27.280 
over we go through the water and then we
run<00:02:25.640> out<00:02:25.849> whereas<00:02:26.750> the<00:02:26.870> birds<00:02:27.079> you<00:02:27.230> can

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
run out whereas the birds you can

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.849 
run out whereas the birds you can
definitely<00:02:27.560> keep<00:02:28.040> up<00:02:28.510> so<00:02:29.510> what<00:02:30.500> I<00:02:30.530> really

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:30.859
