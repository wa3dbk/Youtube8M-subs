a<00:05:07.050> side<00:05:07.350> view<00:05:08.000> looks<00:05:09.000> like<00:05:09.240> this<00:05:10.190> now<00:05:11.190> what

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
a side view looks like this now what

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:12.920 
a side view looks like this now what
you're<00:05:11.460> going<00:05:11.610> to<00:05:11.699> want<00:05:11.820> to<00:05:11.940> do<00:05:12.060> is<00:05:12.360> take<00:05:12.630> this

fold it down to here I'll show you what
that<00:05:20.729> looks<00:05:20.940> like

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:29.270 

build<00:05:25.740> it<00:05:26.330> yet<00:05:27.770> so<00:05:28.770> you<00:05:28.830> should<00:05:29.099> have

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
build it yet so you should have

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.210 
build it yet so you should have
something<00:05:29.520> that<00:05:29.729> looks<00:05:29.909> like<00:05:30.300> this<00:05:31.199> so<00:05:32.009> when<00:05:32.189> I

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.220 
something that looks like this so when I

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.010 
something that looks like this so when I
pick<00:05:32.460> this<00:05:32.610> up<00:05:32.930> you<00:05:33.930> can<00:05:34.110> see<00:05:34.319> it<00:05:35.189> falls

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 
pick this up you can see it falls

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:40.969 
pick this up you can see it falls
directly<00:05:37.020> on<00:05:37.710> that<00:05:38.389> lined<00:05:39.389> up<00:05:39.569> perfect<00:05:40.020> now

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:40.979 
directly on that lined up perfect now

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:42.920 
directly on that lined up perfect now
what<00:05:41.159> you're<00:05:41.280> going<00:05:41.430> to<00:05:41.550> do<00:05:41.669> flip<00:05:42.360> it<00:05:42.509> over<00:05:42.659> on

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
what you're going to do flip it over on

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.439 
what you're going to do flip it over on
the<00:05:43.050> other<00:05:43.080> side<00:05:43.289> and<00:05:44.099> do<00:05:44.550> the<00:05:44.580> same<00:05:44.729> thing<00:05:45.240> on

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:45.449 
the other side and do the same thing on

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:48.379 
the other side and do the same thing on
the<00:05:45.569> other<00:05:45.599> side<00:05:46.699> this<00:05:47.699> one's<00:05:47.939> a<00:05:48.060> little<00:05:48.150> bit

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:48.389 
the other side this one's a little bit

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:49.879 
the other side this one's a little bit
easier<00:05:48.750> because<00:05:48.900> all<00:05:49.110> you<00:05:49.229> have<00:05:49.349> to<00:05:49.500> do<00:05:49.650> is

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:49.889 
easier because all you have to do is

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:54.170 
easier because all you have to do is
make<00:05:50.669> sure<00:05:50.879> the<00:05:51.060> wings<00:05:51.270> metric<00:05:52.400> now<00:05:53.400> you're

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
make sure the wings metric now you're

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.920 
make sure the wings metric now you're
going<00:05:54.270> to<00:05:54.360> open<00:05:54.659> the<00:05:54.810> wings<00:05:55.159> like<00:05:56.159> this<00:05:56.870> go<00:05:57.870> to

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930 
going to open the wings like this go to

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:02.110 
going to open the wings like this go to
the<00:05:58.199> back<00:05:58.610> flip<00:05:59.610> it<00:05:59.789> over<00:05:59.940> go<00:06:00.870> to<00:06:00.930> the<00:06:01.139> back<00:06:01.319> and

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.120 
the back flip it over go to the back and

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.809 
the back flip it over go to the back and
match<00:06:03.120> this<00:06:03.449> edge<00:06:03.719> right<00:06:03.780> here<00:06:04.740> you<00:06:05.610> should

00:06:05.809 --> 00:06:05.819 
match this edge right here you should

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:08.779 
match this edge right here you should
have<00:06:05.969> a<00:06:06.000> little<00:06:06.270> Valley<00:06:06.659> crease<00:06:07.280> right<00:06:08.280> there

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:08.789 
have a little Valley crease right there

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:12.020 
have a little Valley crease right there
so<00:06:09.690> you're<00:06:09.810> going<00:06:09.960> to<00:06:10.020> match<00:06:10.229> this<00:06:10.500> up<00:06:11.030> with

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:12.030

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:14.729 
the valley crease should be about that

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:18.499 
the valley crease should be about that
big<00:06:14.789> and<00:06:16.159> turn<00:06:17.159> it<00:06:17.310> around<00:06:17.430> into<00:06:17.819> the<00:06:18.090> exact

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:27.100 
okay now you've got your plane right

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.700 
okay now you've got your plane right
okay<00:06:27.820> so<00:06:28.120> what<00:06:28.270> you<00:06:28.390> want<00:06:28.570> to<00:06:28.660> do<00:06:28.750> is<00:06:29.020> you<00:06:29.320> want

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:34.270 
to look at the back and make the wings

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:37.230 
to look at the back and make the wings
make<00:06:34.780> a<00:06:34.810> why<00:06:35.520> you're<00:06:36.520> using<00:06:36.760> me<00:06:36.940> do<00:06:37.090> this

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:37.240 
make a why you're using me do this

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.060 
make a why you're using me do this
instead<00:06:37.720> of<00:06:37.780> having<00:06:38.050> them<00:06:38.290> perfect<00:06:38.860> is

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:39.070 
instead of having them perfect is

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:42.270 
instead of having them perfect is
because<00:06:40.000> as<00:06:40.270> you<00:06:40.750> throw<00:06:41.110> it<00:06:41.350> once<00:06:41.830> it's<00:06:42.040> in<00:06:42.160> the

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:42.280 
because as you throw it once it's in the

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:45.200 
because as you throw it once it's in the
air<00:06:42.460> goes<00:06:42.850> like<00:06:43.030> that<00:06:43.210> and<00:06:43.510> that<00:06:43.740> 11mm<00:06:44.740> out

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:45.210 
air goes like that and that 11mm out

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:48.540 
air goes like that and that 11mm out
best<00:06:46.210> way<00:06:46.420> to<00:06:46.480> hold<00:06:46.780> this<00:06:46.990> before<00:06:47.440> throwing<00:06:48.220> it

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:48.550 
best way to hold this before throwing it

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:56.190 
best way to hold this before throwing it
is<00:06:49.470> hold<00:06:50.470> it<00:06:52.080> right<00:06:53.080> here<00:06:54.840> right<00:06:55.840> at<00:06:56.020> that

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:56.200 
is hold it right here right at that

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.960 
is hold it right here right at that
little<00:06:56.380> edge<00:06:56.680> see<00:06:57.070> this<00:06:57.220> is<00:06:57.400> the<00:06:57.430> front<00:06:57.760> of<00:06:57.850> the

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:57.970 
little edge see this is the front of the

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:02.550 
little edge see this is the front of the
plane<00:06:58.380> so<00:06:59.380> right<00:06:59.680> at<00:06:59.890> that<00:07:00.310> little<00:07:00.670> point<00:07:01.560> hold

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:02.560 
plane so right at that little point hold

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:08.040 
plane so right at that little point hold
it<00:07:02.740> there<00:07:03.100> and<00:07:04.050> just<00:07:05.050> toss<00:07:05.920> now<00:07:06.600> like<00:07:07.600> to<00:07:07.840> see
