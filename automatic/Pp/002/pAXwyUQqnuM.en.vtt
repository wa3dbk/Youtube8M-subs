00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
we can figure out now if it will work

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.150 
we can figure out now if it will work
with<00:03:15.069> that<00:03:15.130> okay<00:03:16.060> measurement<00:03:16.870> wise<00:03:17.050> or<00:03:17.590> what

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
with that okay measurement wise or what

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.120 
with that okay measurement wise or what
you<00:03:18.459> recommend<00:03:19.209> I<00:03:19.390> do<00:03:19.720> or<00:03:20.050> not<00:03:20.080> doing<00:03:20.590> what<00:03:20.980> we

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
you recommend I do or not doing what we

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:26.300 
you recommend I do or not doing what we
should<00:03:21.340> do<00:03:21.550> but<00:03:23.190> I<00:03:24.190> brought<00:03:24.490> it<00:03:24.700> just<00:03:24.730> in<00:03:25.150> case
