it and I've tested every single one does

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.730 
it and I've tested every single one does

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
if I keep the only little but I know it

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.420 
if I keep the only little but I know it
does<00:01:44.040> increase<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.670> luminance<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.630> light

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
does increase the luminance the light

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.749 
does increase the luminance the light

for<00:02:08.050> a<00:02:08.080> desk<00:02:08.320> lamp<00:02:08.470> I<00:02:08.860> think<00:02:09.310> the<00:02:09.399> color

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
for a desk lamp I think the color

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.270 
for a desk lamp I think the color
accuracy<00:02:09.940> is<00:02:10.360> or<00:02:10.810> I<00:02:11.110> don't<00:02:11.890> think<00:02:12.070> is<00:02:12.130> gonna

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
accuracy is or I don't think is gonna

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.360 
accuracy is or I don't think is gonna
hurt<00:02:12.370> my<00:02:12.520> eyes<00:02:12.700> or<00:02:12.850> anything<00:02:13.860> and<00:02:14.860> at<00:02:15.010> night<00:02:15.220> if

top one it's light in the middle that's
top<00:02:31.480> one<00:02:31.720> it's<00:02:32.590> very<00:02:32.770> simple<00:02:33.160> very

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
top one it's very simple very

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.110 
top one it's very simple very
straightforward<00:02:33.700> to<00:02:34.000> use<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:36.040> base<00:02:36.280> it's<00:02:37.030> not

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
straightforward to use the base it's not

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.420 
straightforward to use the base it's not
too<00:02:37.360> heavy<00:02:37.570> but<00:02:37.870> it's<00:02:38.739> just<00:02:38.950> heavy<00:02:39.160> enough<00:02:39.220> so

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
too heavy but it's just heavy enough so

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.760 
too heavy but it's just heavy enough so
that<00:02:39.610> when<00:02:39.820> I<00:02:39.880> just<00:02:40.390> the<00:02:40.510> arm<00:02:40.660> it<00:02:41.350> doesn't<00:02:41.680> move

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
that when I just the arm it doesn't move
