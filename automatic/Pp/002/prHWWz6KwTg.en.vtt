whole business is cutting wood and

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.010 
whole business is cutting wood and
seasoning<00:00:35.740> it<00:00:35.830> properly<00:00:36.480> I'm<00:00:37.480> afraid<00:00:37.810> that

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:38.020 
seasoning it properly I'm afraid that

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.930 
seasoning it properly I'm afraid that
I'm<00:00:38.470> a<00:00:38.530> little<00:00:38.739> bit<00:00:38.890> of<00:00:39.100> a<00:00:39.160> snob<00:00:39.370> when<00:00:39.610> it<00:00:39.670> comes

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
I'm a little bit of a snob when it comes

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.760 
I'm a little bit of a snob when it comes
down<00:00:40.090> to<00:00:40.150> it<00:00:40.390> and<00:00:40.570> maybe<00:00:41.110> it's<00:00:41.320> because<00:00:41.500> I'm

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:41.770 
down to it and maybe it's because I'm

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.440 
down to it and maybe it's because I'm
not<00:00:41.890> as<00:00:42.070> young<00:00:42.100> as<00:00:42.280> I<00:00:42.489> once<00:00:42.700> was<00:00:42.940> but<00:00:42.970> I<00:00:43.210> feel

not as young as I once was but I feel

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:44.580 
not as young as I once was but I feel
that<00:00:43.480> I<00:00:43.630> don't<00:00:43.720> have<00:00:43.900> time<00:00:44.230> to<00:00:44.440> make

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:44.590 
that I don't have time to make

instruments<00:00:45.129> with<00:00:45.309> Greenwood<00:00:46.059> I<00:00:46.300> really<00:00:47.140> have

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
instruments with Greenwood I really have

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.380 
instruments with Greenwood I really have
to<00:00:47.500> find<00:00:47.800> the<00:00:48.129> oldest<00:00:48.520> stuff<00:00:48.820> you<00:00:49.000> can<00:00:49.150> find

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
to find the oldest stuff you can find

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.119 
to find the oldest stuff you can find
and<00:00:49.660> basically<00:00:50.110> you<00:00:50.230> do<00:00:50.350> that<00:00:50.530> by<00:00:50.710> talking<00:00:50.770> to

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129 
and basically you do that by talking to

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:53.400 
and basically you do that by talking to
other<00:00:51.250> violin<00:00:51.760> makers<00:00:52.120> and<00:00:52.450> people<00:00:53.020> have<00:00:53.260> been

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410 
other violin makers and people have been

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.430 
other violin makers and people have been
in<00:00:53.500> the<00:00:53.590> business<00:00:53.949> and<00:00:54.129> the<00:00:54.850> violin<00:00:55.629> trade<00:00:56.050> as

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
a as a rule tends to be

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.829 
a as a rule tends to be
multi-generational<00:01:00.850> so<00:01:01.210> people<00:01:01.570> who<00:01:01.690> get

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:01.839 
multi-generational so people who get

continue the business for several

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.050 
continue the business for several
generations<00:01:04.930> so<00:01:05.680> you<00:01:06.280> can<00:01:06.460> find<00:01:06.700> people<00:01:07.030> that

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
you know their grandpa had some wood

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.700 
you know their grandpa had some wood
back<00:01:09.520> in<00:01:09.700> the<00:01:09.850> in<00:01:10.570> the<00:01:10.750> day<00:01:10.930> and<00:01:11.200> they<00:01:11.530> haven't

ago no not at all actually we're

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.310 
ago no not at all actually we're
starting<00:01:23.290> to<00:01:23.820> research<00:01:24.820> the<00:01:25.659> most<00:01:25.870> current

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
starting to research the most current

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.680 
starting to research the most current
research<00:01:27.330> actually<00:01:29.729> focuses<00:01:30.729> on<00:01:30.940> specific

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
research actually focuses on specific

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.959 
research actually focuses on specific
density<00:01:32.229> of<00:01:32.590> the<00:01:32.710> wood<00:01:32.860> as<00:01:33.130> opposed<00:01:33.549> to<00:01:33.700> how

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:33.969 
density of the wood as opposed to how

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:36.779 
density of the wood as opposed to how
old<00:01:34.149> it<00:01:34.299> is<00:01:34.420> and<00:01:34.770> there<00:01:35.770> are<00:01:35.920> many<00:01:36.189> makers<00:01:36.610> we

America many many makers now are using
newer<00:01:45.700> woods<00:01:46.680> that<00:01:47.680> but<00:01:48.039> they're<00:01:48.189> very<00:01:48.700> picky

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
newer woods that but they're very picky

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:50.760 
newer woods that but they're very picky
about<00:01:49.149> the<00:01:49.570> specific<00:01:50.049> density<00:01:50.439> of<00:01:50.530> the<00:01:50.619> wood

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
about the specific density of the wood

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.760 
about the specific density of the wood
you<00:01:51.130> know<00:01:51.250> per<00:01:51.549> cubic<00:01:51.850> centimeter<00:01:52.329> and<00:01:52.770> what

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
you know per cubic centimeter and what

you know per cubic centimeter and what
we're<00:01:53.890> finding<00:01:54.070> is<00:01:54.369> that<00:01:54.399> they're<00:01:54.700> getting

to<00:02:09.729> remember<00:02:09.910> that<00:02:10.119> wood<00:02:10.720> is<00:02:10.869> really<00:02:11.020> a<00:02:11.170> crop

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
to remember that wood is really a crop

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.470 
to remember that wood is really a crop
like<00:02:11.890> corn<00:02:11.920> or<00:02:12.370> cotton<00:02:12.430> or<00:02:12.910> anything<00:02:13.060> else<00:02:13.360> it

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
like corn or cotton or anything else it

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.900 
like corn or cotton or anything else it
just<00:02:13.510> takes<00:02:13.810> a<00:02:13.900> little<00:02:14.020> longer<00:02:14.170> to<00:02:14.440> grow<00:02:14.910> but

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
just takes a little longer to grow but

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.090 
just takes a little longer to grow but
you<00:02:16.330> know<00:02:16.450> every<00:02:16.750> summer<00:02:17.140> every<00:02:17.590> winter

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100

house and that's just something that's

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:21.810 
house and that's just something that's
been<00:02:20.830> growing<00:02:21.010> for<00:02:21.190> about<00:02:21.280> four<00:02:21.610> or<00:02:21.670> five

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
can you tell about the density by just

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.809 
can you tell about the density by just
looking<00:02:26.380> at<00:02:26.650> a<00:02:26.710> piece<00:02:26.860> of<00:02:27.040> maple<00:02:27.250> for<00:02:27.550> the<00:02:27.640> back

cutting<00:02:42.189> in<00:02:42.370> it<00:02:42.459> and<00:02:42.579> there's<00:02:42.700> ways<00:02:42.909> of

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
cutting in it and there's ways of

cutting in it and there's ways of
there's<00:02:44.500> ways<00:02:44.680> of<00:02:44.829> measuring<00:02:45.010> things<00:02:45.519> and

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
there's ways of measuring things and

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.220 
there's ways of measuring things and
weighing<00:02:45.939> it<00:02:46.209> you<00:02:46.360> know<00:02:46.480> and<00:02:46.659> you<00:02:46.750> say<00:02:47.079> how

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
weighing it you know and you say how

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.339 
weighing it you know and you say how
thick<00:02:47.439> it<00:02:47.560> is<00:02:47.650> but<00:02:48.400> most<00:02:48.909> in<00:02:49.870> the<00:02:50.049> old<00:02:50.170> days

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:50.349 
thick it is but most in the old days

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:51.569 
thick it is but most in the old days
they<00:02:50.500> would<00:02:50.650> do<00:02:50.709> a<00:02:50.739> flow<00:02:50.980> test<00:02:51.280> where<00:02:51.489> they

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:51.579 
they would do a flow test where they

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:53.069 
they would do a flow test where they
actually<00:02:51.879> literally<00:02:52.150> had<00:02:52.450> a<00:02:52.480> bucket<00:02:52.900> and<00:02:53.019> they

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:53.079 
actually literally had a bucket and they

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:54.479 
actually literally had a bucket and they
would<00:02:53.200> put<00:02:53.349> it<00:02:53.440> in<00:02:53.530> the<00:02:53.620> bucket<00:02:53.860> they<00:02:54.340> would

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
would put it in the bucket they would

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.069 
would put it in the bucket they would
draw<00:02:54.790> a<00:02:54.819> line<00:02:55.060> and<00:02:55.299> see<00:02:55.450> how<00:02:55.569> far<00:02:55.780> up<00:02:55.840> it

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:56.079 
draw a line and see how far up it

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:02.220 
draw a line and see how far up it
floated<00:02:56.790> but<00:02:57.790> like<00:02:58.780> for<00:02:58.930> instance<00:03:00.989> both<00:03:01.989> of

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
floated but like for instance both of

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
able to see these little curly lines in

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.660 
able to see these little curly lines in
there<00:03:12.700> when<00:03:13.150> people<00:03:13.450> call<00:03:13.599> that<00:03:13.629> Tiger<00:03:14.170> maple

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
there when people call that Tiger maple

there when people call that Tiger maple
or<00:03:15.670> curly<00:03:16.150> maple<00:03:16.500> and<00:03:17.500> it's<00:03:17.680> just<00:03:17.889> it's<00:03:18.310> a<00:03:18.459> it's

or curly maple and it's just it's a it's
something<00:03:20.200> about<00:03:20.379> the<00:03:20.530> way<00:03:20.620> the<00:03:20.769> wood<00:03:20.920> grows

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
something about the way the wood grows

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.740 
something about the way the wood grows
and<00:03:21.549> there's<00:03:21.700> other<00:03:21.849> kinds<00:03:22.180> of<00:03:22.239> woods<00:03:22.480> like

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
and there's other kinds of woods like

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.289 
and there's other kinds of woods like
poplar<00:03:23.109> that<00:03:23.319> also<00:03:23.440> have<00:03:23.739> curls<00:03:24.069> in<00:03:24.250> them<00:03:24.370> okay

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
poplar that also have curls in them okay

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:27.330 
poplar that also have curls in them okay
now<00:03:25.510> this<00:03:25.659> is<00:03:25.720> a<00:03:25.870> very<00:03:26.079> old<00:03:26.349> piece<00:03:26.590> you<00:03:27.040> can<00:03:27.190> see

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
now this is a very old piece you can see

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.860 
now this is a very old piece you can see
it<00:03:27.459> almost<00:03:27.849> looks<00:03:28.120> like<00:03:28.180> it's<00:03:28.450> kind<00:03:28.840> of

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
it almost looks like it's kind of

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.479 
it almost looks like it's kind of
tobacco<00:03:29.049> stained<00:03:29.650> it's<00:03:29.889> been<00:03:30.099> sitting<00:03:30.400> around

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
tobacco stained it's been sitting around

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:33.360 
tobacco stained it's been sitting around
for<00:03:30.849> so<00:03:31.000> long<00:03:31.180> and<00:03:32.109> this<00:03:32.349> is<00:03:32.530> relatively

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
for so long and this is relatively

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.180 
for so long and this is relatively
lightweight<00:03:34.139> this<00:03:35.139> is<00:03:35.200> another<00:03:35.620> species<00:03:35.950> of

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
lightweight this is another species of

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.520 
lightweight this is another species of
maple<00:03:36.430> that's<00:03:36.849> also<00:03:37.269> very<00:03:37.720> very<00:03:37.959> curly<00:03:38.260> you

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
maple that's also very very curly you

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.050 
maple that's also very very curly you
can<00:03:38.680> see<00:03:38.859> that<00:03:39.040> when<00:03:39.430> it<00:03:39.519> gets<00:03:39.669> cut<00:03:39.910> that's

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
can see that when it gets cut that's

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.759 
can see that when it gets cut that's
going<00:03:40.150> to<00:03:40.299> be<00:03:40.419> very<00:03:40.540> curly<00:03:40.930> but<00:03:41.379> this<00:03:41.560> is<00:03:41.739> a

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
going to be very curly but this is a

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:44.640 
going to be very curly but this is a
really<00:03:42.370> heavy<00:03:42.519> piece<00:03:42.819> of<00:03:43.000> maple<00:03:43.410> really<00:03:44.410> heavy

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
really heavy piece of maple really heavy

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.680 
really heavy piece of maple really heavy
and<00:03:44.889> even<00:03:45.400> though<00:03:45.609> it's<00:03:45.760> also<00:03:45.970> just<00:03:46.389> as<00:03:46.540> old

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
and even though it's also just as old

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.390 
and even though it's also just as old
for<00:03:47.139> some<00:03:47.319> reason<00:03:47.680> this<00:03:48.250> one<00:03:48.310> says<00:03:48.699> 24<00:03:49.150> years

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
for some reason this one says 24 years

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.339 
for some reason this one says 24 years
that's<00:03:51.400> not<00:03:51.519> as<00:03:51.699> old<00:03:51.879> as<00:03:52.000> this<00:03:52.180> but<00:03:52.720> it<00:03:53.319> should

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:53.349 
that's not as old as this but it should

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:55.650 
that's not as old as this but it should
be<00:03:53.590> ready<00:03:53.919> to<00:03:54.099> be<00:03:54.220> used<00:03:54.430> I<00:03:54.760> think<00:03:55.449> I'm<00:03:55.540> gonna

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
be ready to be used I think I'm gonna

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.449 
be ready to be used I think I'm gonna
wait<00:03:55.870> on<00:03:55.930> this<00:03:56.199> one<00:03:56.379> for<00:03:56.530> a<00:03:56.590> while<00:03:56.680> because<00:03:57.340> I'm

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
wait on this one for a while because I'm

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.589 
wait on this one for a while because I'm
just<00:03:57.609> waiting<00:03:58.000> for<00:03:58.030> it<00:03:58.269> to<00:03:59.699> lighten<00:04:00.699> up<00:04:00.910> the

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:01.599 
just waiting for it to lighten up the

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:03.390 
just waiting for it to lighten up the
thing<00:04:01.810> to<00:04:01.930> understand<00:04:02.349> is<00:04:02.530> that<00:04:02.560> when<00:04:03.310> they

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
thing to understand is that when they

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.180 
thing to understand is that when they
cut<00:04:03.609> the<00:04:03.730> wood<00:04:03.910> down<00:04:04.620> when<00:04:05.620> they<00:04:05.709> cut<00:04:05.889> the<00:04:05.919> wood

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
cut the wood down when they cut the wood

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.860 
cut the wood down when they cut the wood
down<00:04:06.540> most<00:04:07.540> of<00:04:07.720> the<00:04:07.780> weight<00:04:08.069> that's<00:04:09.069> in<00:04:09.370> it<00:04:09.519> is

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
down most of the weight that's in it is

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.500 
down most of the weight that's in it is
water<00:04:10.870> and<00:04:11.730> they<00:04:12.730> can<00:04:12.760> make<00:04:13.090> the<00:04:13.269> water

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
water and they can make the water

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.839 
water and they can make the water
evaporate<00:04:14.139> pretty<00:04:14.349> quickly<00:04:14.590> because<00:04:15.010> water

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:15.849 
evaporate pretty quickly because water

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:18.479 
evaporate pretty quickly because water
is<00:04:15.970> a<00:04:16.060> very<00:04:16.269> small<00:04:16.810> simple<00:04:17.739> molecule<00:04:18.280> it's

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
is a very small simple molecule it's

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.899 
is a very small simple molecule it's
only<00:04:18.639> you<00:04:19.570> know<00:04:19.690> two<00:04:20.169> atoms<00:04:20.500> of<00:04:20.650> hydrogen<00:04:20.909> and

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:21.909 
only you know two atoms of hydrogen and

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:26.279 
only you know two atoms of hydrogen and
one<00:04:22.060> atom<00:04:22.090> of<00:04:22.419> oxygen<00:04:24.630> and<00:04:25.630> they<00:04:26.080> move<00:04:26.260> around

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:26.289 
one atom of oxygen and they move around

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:27.659 
one atom of oxygen and they move around
really<00:04:26.650> quickly<00:04:26.919> that's<00:04:27.159> why<00:04:27.280> you<00:04:27.340> can<00:04:27.460> boil

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669 
really quickly that's why you can boil

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:30.149 
really quickly that's why you can boil
water<00:04:27.940> it<00:04:28.210> evaporates<00:04:28.840> from<00:04:29.080> being<00:04:29.349> snow<00:04:29.650> into

00:04:30.149 --> 00:04:30.159 
water it evaporates from being snow into

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:34.170 
water it evaporates from being snow into
being<00:04:31.080> water<00:04:32.080> vapor<00:04:32.349> but<00:04:32.880> inside<00:04:33.880> trees

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
being water vapor but inside trees

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.810 
being water vapor but inside trees
there's<00:04:34.479> also<00:04:34.810> big<00:04:35.289> big<00:04:35.530> big<00:04:35.800> molecules<00:04:36.520> made

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
there's also big big big molecules made

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.640 
there's also big big big molecules made
of<00:04:36.940> sugars<00:04:37.330> and<00:04:37.630> hydrocarbons<00:04:38.289> and<00:04:38.470> things

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
of sugars and hydrocarbons and things

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.680 
of sugars and hydrocarbons and things
and<00:04:39.099> those<00:04:39.400> take<00:04:39.639> a<00:04:39.669> lot<00:04:39.880> longer<00:04:40.090> to<00:04:40.270> get<00:04:40.479> out

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
and those take a lot longer to get out

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.600 
and those take a lot longer to get out
that's<00:04:40.930> why<00:04:41.139> you<00:04:41.830> walk<00:04:42.039> into<00:04:42.250> an<00:04:42.460> old

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
that's why you walk into an old

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.080 
that's why you walk into an old
farmhouse<00:04:42.970> and<00:04:43.419> it<00:04:43.479> has<00:04:43.630> pine<00:04:43.930> floors<00:04:44.820> and<00:04:45.820> you

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
farmhouse and it has pine floors and you

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:48.760 
farmhouse and it has pine floors and you
would<00:04:47.330> this<00:04:47.780> is<00:04:47.930> great<00:04:48.169> this<00:04:48.350> house<00:04:48.560> smells

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
would this is great this house smells

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.430 
would this is great this house smells
I'm<00:04:49.040> wonderful<00:04:49.510> what<00:04:50.510> you're<00:04:50.690> smelling<00:04:50.930> our

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
I'm wonderful what you're smelling our

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.490 
I'm wonderful what you're smelling our
molecules<00:04:52.100> from<00:04:52.460> pine<00:04:52.880> in<00:04:53.240> the<00:04:53.360> floor<00:04:53.630> that

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
molecules from pine in the floor that

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:55.719 
molecules from pine in the floor that
have<00:04:54.620> probably<00:04:54.830> been<00:04:55.010> in<00:04:55.190> that<00:04:55.310> floor<00:04:55.490> for<00:04:55.699> a

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:55.729 
have probably been in that floor for a

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:57.040 
have probably been in that floor for a
hundred<00:04:56.000> years<00:04:56.210> and<00:04:56.389> they're<00:04:56.510> still<00:04:56.750> coming

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
hundred years and they're still coming

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.159 
hundred years and they're still coming
out<00:04:57.850> so<00:04:58.850> you're<00:04:59.030> seeing<00:04:59.330> this<00:04:59.630> you<00:05:00.080> know

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:00.169 
out so you're seeing this you know

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:01.659 
out so you're seeing this you know
evolution<00:05:00.770> of<00:05:00.889> the<00:05:00.979> wood<00:05:01.160> but<00:05:01.340> that's<00:05:01.520> why

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:01.669 
evolution of the wood but that's why

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:03.370 
evolution of the wood but that's why
when<00:05:01.910> they<00:05:02.000> find<00:05:02.270> old<00:05:02.449> churches<00:05:02.870> and<00:05:03.169> stuff

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 
when they find old churches and stuff

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:04.600 
when they find old churches and stuff
they<00:05:03.530> start<00:05:03.740> tearing<00:05:03.919> down<00:05:04.130> all<00:05:04.310> the<00:05:04.400> crazy

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
they start tearing down all the crazy

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.480 
they start tearing down all the crazy
violin<00:05:05.030> makers<00:05:05.300> show<00:05:05.449> up<00:05:06.160> start<00:05:07.160> digging

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
violin makers show up start digging

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:12.490 
violin makers show up start digging
through<00:05:07.520> the<00:05:07.699> trash<00:05:10.270> it's<00:05:11.270> it's<00:05:11.690> it's<00:05:12.169> a<00:05:12.290> great

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
through the trash it's it's it's a great

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:13.210 
through the trash it's it's it's a great
adventure

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
adventure

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.100 
adventure
no<00:05:13.400> question<00:05:14.030> about<00:05:14.060> that<00:05:14.240> but<00:05:14.600> the<00:05:14.690> results

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
no question about that but the results

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.010 
no question about that but the results
speak<00:05:15.680> for<00:05:15.830> themselves
