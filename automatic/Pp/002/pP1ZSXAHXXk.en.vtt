00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.180
 same 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.090
 first of all we are going to stir all 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.729
 our ingredients let's start 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.890
 with the powder milk after we leave 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.979

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.689
 we are going to cast activated carbon and 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:50.049
 after this we will take three 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:52.479
 to four droplets of essential oil of 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:55.119
 mint later we're going to go with the 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.789
 tea tree oil also throw it with 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.409
 about two to four droplets you 're not going to 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:01.450
 throw a lot because remember that this is 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.850
 a mask for acne and we do not want 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.920
 your face is to resect or anything 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.649
 those things later we're going to take the 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.049
 honey bee forgiveness this is like that 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.940
 it's hard because it 's raw and you put the one 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:15.160
 you prefer me I love this one because 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.200
 I feel it is more natural and then I 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.180
 let's throw water remember that if you 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.580
 we take water can not last more than two 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.900
 days in the refrigerator then you 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.690
 I recommend that you leave as your 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.940
 mask already made but dry and when 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.489
 You can see it using water depending on 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.319
 the portion that you will need is a 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.299
 consistency that our 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:37.480
 mask as well as that pasty 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:39.250
 professional after we go to 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.860
 our face with a very capita 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.620
 thin good as you can see some 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.870
 parts are drying up, others are not 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.120
 parts that are as shiny these are not 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.760
 are dry then I will wait for 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.760
 everything is dry all the mask 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.950
 it looks opaque like this part of here and 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.530
 then I 'm going to remove it with cold water 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.269
 and already after a while of creampie and 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.010
 all that and I will let my face 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:05.200
 rest because I went to the dentist and 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.239
 all those things I do not have to leave 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.920
