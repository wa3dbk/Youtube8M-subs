00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.510
 Hello, good morning my name is Luis 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.690
 fernando vÃ©lez I am the creator of the 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:18.259
 perfect love coffee brand I invite you to 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:21.230
 that in company with me know that it is 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:24.649
 everything we do with coffee 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:27.590
 colombia in this company we are coffees 

00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:30.950
 of the highest quality roast coffee 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:34.280
 100% Colombian origin 100% 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:37.730
 selected and we have a quality of 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.260
 threshing that is called this 320 that is one 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.199
 of the highest standards of the 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:45.739
 industry all this came up like a dream 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:48.480
 in the year 97 we had a warehouse of 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:51.390
 gifts with my ex-wife 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.700
 and we started offering coffee to the 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.450
 customers between client and client and 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:59.280
 started a great frustration to see that 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.930
 in the country that had the reputation of 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.150
 produce the best coffees in the world 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.400
 for a person who was going to ride a 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.550
 coffee was not possible to get in the 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.550
 High quality grains market and grains 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.979
 freshly toasted in the 98 solve 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.470
 buy my own toaster and started 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.560
 as a whole trip as we say to 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.869
 already many trunks to achieve what 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.619
 that today we have used me as 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.149
 example to achieve that in the year 2003 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:29.880
 will change the law of pills and gravel 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:32.130
 it was the law that did not allow 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.920
 roasters from colombia could have 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.800
 access to the best grains in 2000 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.729
 when I went to want to learn how to 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:44.789
 Toasted a coffee I began to understand that the 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:48.750
 barista is the last link in the 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:52.410
 chain initiated by 560 thousand coffee growers 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:55.020
 in Colombia sowing a seed the 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:58.050
 last link was someone that neither 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.190
 was not even known or recognized in the 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:03.170
 industry and is the professional barista 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.290
 manager of 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.780
 prepare the best cup of coffee here 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.130
 I have an example is jacqueline one of 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.920
 our baristas that is us 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:16.459
 preparing a delicious coffee in this 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.500
 moment of a specific origin a coffee 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.140
 like the one that each one of you is going to 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.360
 receive and will be able to enjoy thus a 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.950
 trip that we have first enjoyed 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.670
 enjoyed but has not stopped having 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:31.250
 many vicissitudes one of them that 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.260
 for me maybe it's the most important and 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.769
 the one that fills me with emotion is seeing 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.470
 as my father said it can not be that my 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:41.660
 son has finished serving reds but 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.209
 today when he sees the achievements and sees what 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.250
 we are doing it says to my brothers 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.350
 tell Luis that I sell him some actions 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.049
 of your company because that is going to have 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.120
 a lot of future this is an anecdote that 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:56.060
 like to tell the why somehow 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.970
 sometimes we have paradigms that 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.910
 they do not give us the opportunity to 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:05.180
 develop our dreams and do 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:08.239
 reality what we want in life
