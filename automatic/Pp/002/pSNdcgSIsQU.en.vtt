00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.370 

so<00:00:01.089> your<00:00:01.270> first<00:00:01.420> stomach<00:00:01.899> right<00:00:02.590> here<00:00:03.210> is<00:00:04.210> the

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
so your first stomach right here is the

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.890 
so your first stomach right here is the
reticulum<00:00:05.380> and<00:00:06.360> then<00:00:07.360> you've<00:00:07.569> got<00:00:07.750> this

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:07.900 
reticulum and then you've got this

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.839 
reticulum and then you've got this
really<00:00:08.109> large<00:00:08.619> one<00:00:08.980> that<00:00:09.190> looks<00:00:09.369> like<00:00:09.459> a<00:00:09.579> ball

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:09.849 
really large one that looks like a ball

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:13.829 
really large one that looks like a ball
and<00:00:10.719> that<00:00:11.379> is<00:00:11.559> the<00:00:11.829> Omega<00:00:12.449> know<00:00:13.449> if<00:00:13.599> you<00:00:13.690> can

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:13.839 
and that is the Omega know if you can

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:18.420 
and that is the Omega know if you can
see<00:00:14.049> that<00:00:14.459> and<00:00:15.459> then<00:00:17.070> that's<00:00:18.070> actually<00:00:18.220> a

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:18.430 
see that and then that's actually a

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:20.250 
see that and then that's actually a
third<00:00:18.610> stomach<00:00:19.030> the<00:00:19.450> large<00:00:19.690> one<00:00:19.870> right<00:00:20.020> here

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:20.260 
third stomach the large one right here

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:21.900 
third stomach the large one right here
is<00:00:20.290> the<00:00:20.560> rumen<00:00:21.040> that's<00:00:21.400> going<00:00:21.610> to<00:00:21.670> be<00:00:21.760> the

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:21.910 
is the rumen that's going to be the

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.450 
is the rumen that's going to be the
second<00:00:22.270> compartment<00:00:22.600> and<00:00:23.410> then<00:00:23.860> your<00:00:24.040> boards

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:24.460 
second compartment and then your boards

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.800 
second compartment and then your boards
and<00:00:24.640> true<00:00:25.000> stomach<00:00:25.510> is<00:00:25.750> the<00:00:26.410> Abba<00:00:27.039> Mason<00:00:27.810> and

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
and true stomach is the Abba Mason and

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.660 
and true stomach is the Abba Mason and
at<00:00:29.170> the<00:00:29.289> end<00:00:29.470> of<00:00:29.590> the<00:00:29.710> animation<00:00:29.860> we<00:00:30.400> see<00:00:30.550> this

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:30.670 
at the end of the animation we see this

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.799 
at the end of the animation we see this
muscular<00:00:31.330> structure<00:00:31.739> this<00:00:32.739> is<00:00:32.980> the<00:00:33.159> pylorus

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
muscular structure this is the pylorus

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.090 
muscular structure this is the pylorus
so<00:00:34.809> you<00:00:34.899> really<00:00:35.199> need<00:00:35.320> to<00:00:35.440> make<00:00:35.559> sure<00:00:35.620> that<00:00:35.829> you

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
so you really need to make sure that you

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.410 
so you really need to make sure that you
can<00:00:36.280> see<00:00:36.489> the<00:00:36.640> difference<00:00:36.969> since<00:00:37.149> you<00:00:37.239> won't

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
can see the difference since you won't

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.660 
can see the difference since you won't
be<00:00:37.539> able<00:00:37.600> to<00:00:37.749> touch<00:00:38.039> how<00:00:39.039> thick<00:00:39.429> this<00:00:39.609> is

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.670 
be able to touch how thick this is

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.250 
be able to touch how thick this is
because<00:00:40.149> you<00:00:40.239> will<00:00:40.390> because<00:00:40.719> on<00:00:40.870> both<00:00:40.989> sides

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
because you will because on both sides

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.399 
because you will because on both sides
so<00:00:42.039> coming<00:00:42.370> out<00:00:42.489> of<00:00:42.519> the<00:00:42.699> pylorus<00:00:43.210> the<00:00:44.170> first

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:44.409 
so coming out of the pylorus the first

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:46.110 
so coming out of the pylorus the first
part<00:00:44.649> of<00:00:44.710> the<00:00:44.859> small<00:00:45.010> intestine<00:00:45.159> is<00:00:45.819> to<00:00:45.969> do<00:00:46.089> a

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
part of the small intestine is to do a

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.489 
part of the small intestine is to do a
loop<00:00:46.479> right<00:00:47.019> here<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:49.539> then<00:00:49.780> you<00:00:49.989> have<00:00:50.199> the

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:50.499 
loop right here and then you have the

00:00:50.499 --> 00:00:57.899 
loop right here and then you have the
sigmoid<00:00:51.429> loop<00:00:51.670> of<00:00:52.510> the<00:00:52.749> duodenum<00:00:56.399> so<00:00:57.399> after<00:00:57.879> a

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:57.909 
sigmoid loop of the duodenum so after a

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:01.799 
sigmoid loop of the duodenum so after a
bit<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:59.289> all<00:00:59.469> know<00:00:59.710> who<00:01:00.039> the<00:01:00.069> star<00:01:00.399> into<00:01:00.940> the

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809 
bit you all know who the star into the

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:03.660 
bit you all know who the star into the
largest<00:01:02.109> part<00:01:02.469> of<00:01:02.530> the<00:01:02.620> small<00:01:02.679> intestine<00:01:02.889> the

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
largest part of the small intestine the

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.110 
largest part of the small intestine the
jejunal<00:01:04.200> this<00:01:05.200> is<00:01:05.379> going<00:01:05.620> to<00:01:05.680> be<00:01:05.830> free<00:01:06.730> surface

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:07.120 
jejunal this is going to be free surface

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.970 
jejunal this is going to be free surface
area<00:01:07.420> includes<00:01:08.080> absorption<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:10.570> then<00:01:11.140> right

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:11.980 
area includes absorption and then right

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.220 
area includes absorption and then right
here<00:01:12.040> coming<00:01:13.030> off<00:01:13.180> of<00:01:13.210> the<00:01:13.450> juju<00:01:13.870> know<00:01:14.020> is

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:14.230 
here coming off of the juju know is

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:20.370 
here coming off of the juju know is
mesentery<00:01:17.160> okay<00:01:18.160> and<00:01:18.460> then<00:01:18.880> the<00:01:19.570> last<00:01:19.750> part<00:01:20.110> of

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
mesentery okay and then the last part of

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.040 
mesentery okay and then the last part of
your<00:01:20.440> small<00:01:20.890> intestine<00:01:21.150> is<00:01:22.150> the<00:01:22.330> ileum<00:01:22.750> the

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.050 
your small intestine is the ileum the

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.590 
your small intestine is the ileum the
easiest<00:01:23.560> way<00:01:23.680> to<00:01:23.740> find<00:01:23.830> your<00:01:24.100> ileum<00:01:24.490> really

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
easiest way to find your ileum really

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.890 
easiest way to find your ileum really
is<00:01:25.810> to<00:01:26.020> find<00:01:26.260> your<00:01:26.680> seat

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
is to find your seat

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.170 
is to find your seat
professor<00:01:28.900> von<00:01:29.080> ok<00:01:29.590> so<00:01:30.430> this<00:01:30.520> blind<00:01:30.820> fact

professor von ok so this blind fact
right<00:01:31.390> here<00:01:31.659> is<00:01:31.750> the<00:01:31.780> secret<00:01:32.140> and<00:01:32.680> you<00:01:33.040> want<00:01:33.220> to

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
right here is the secret and you want to

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.730 
right here is the secret and you want to
use<00:01:33.460> this<00:01:33.729> to<00:01:34.630> kind<00:01:34.810> of<00:01:34.930> get<00:01:35.320> yourself

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
use this to kind of get yourself

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.560 
use this to kind of get yourself
orientated<00:01:36.549> anytime<00:01:37.030> you're<00:01:37.210> taking<00:01:37.479> your

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
orientated anytime you're taking your

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.770 
orientated anytime you're taking your
quizzes<00:01:38.190> so<00:01:39.190> the<00:01:39.670> small<00:01:39.909> intestine<00:01:40.420> coming

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
quizzes so the small intestine coming

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.520 
quizzes so the small intestine coming
out<00:01:41.020> of<00:01:41.049> them<00:01:41.350> sika<00:01:42.190> is<00:01:42.939> the<00:01:43.149> ileum<00:01:43.509> and<00:01:43.960> it

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
out of them sika is the ileum and it

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.320 
out of them sika is the ileum and it
looks<00:01:44.710> no<00:01:44.890> different<00:01:44.920> than<00:01:45.369> the<00:01:45.729> jejunum<00:01:46.149> so

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
looks no different than the jejunum so

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:47.789 
looks no different than the jejunum so
you<00:01:46.630> just<00:01:46.750> really<00:01:47.020> need<00:01:47.140> to<00:01:47.200> use<00:01:47.350> your<00:01:47.380> sica

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:47.799 
you just really need to use your sica

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:51.539 
you just really need to use your sica
and<00:01:48.009> this<00:01:49.619> connective<00:01:50.619> tissue<00:01:50.799> between<00:01:50.950> this

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549 
and this connective tissue between this

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:55.130 
and this connective tissue between this
he<00:01:51.759> comes<00:01:51.970> and<00:01:52.210> ileum<00:01:52.690> is<00:01:52.899> the<00:01:53.110> ileocecal<00:01:53.740> full

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
he comes and ileum is the ileocecal full

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.270 
he comes and ileum is the ileocecal full
so<00:01:56.140> your<00:01:56.320> cecum<00:01:56.680> is<00:01:56.770> going<00:01:56.890> to<00:01:56.950> be<00:01:57.009> the<00:01:57.100> first

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
so your cecum is going to be the first

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.850 
so your cecum is going to be the first
part<00:01:57.460> of<00:01:57.640> your<00:01:57.700> large<00:01:58.030> intestine<00:01:58.530> so<00:01:59.530> coming

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
part of your large intestine so coming

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.930 
part of your large intestine so coming
out<00:01:59.979> of<00:02:00.009> this<00:02:00.630> you've<00:02:01.630> got<00:02:01.979> right<00:02:02.979> here<00:02:03.009> the

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
out of this you've got right here the

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.930 
out of this you've got right here the
proximal<00:02:04.569> loop<00:02:04.750> of<00:02:04.960> the<00:02:05.140> a<00:02:05.170> sending<00:02:05.890> cold<00:02:06.100> so

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
proximal loop of the a sending cold so

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.570 
proximal loop of the a sending cold so
you<00:02:07.030> can<00:02:07.300> be<00:02:07.569> pinned<00:02:07.840> from<00:02:08.830> this<00:02:08.979> side<00:02:09.190> or

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
you can be pinned from this side or

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.280 
you can be pinned from this side or
probably<00:02:10.179> over<00:02:10.450> here<00:02:10.630> so<00:02:10.810> you<00:02:10.840> just<00:02:11.019> know<00:02:11.170> this

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
probably over here so you just know this

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.800 
probably over here so you just know this
really<00:02:11.470> large<00:02:11.739> scoop<00:02:12.250> openness<00:02:13.180> i<00:02:13.360> found<00:02:13.569> is

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.530 
really large scoop openness i found is
proximal<00:02:14.440> you<00:02:14.530> put<00:02:14.680> a<00:02:14.769> semicolon<00:02:15.360> are<00:02:16.360> your

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
proximal you put a semicolon are your

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.000 
proximal you put a semicolon are your
proximal<00:02:17.110> loop<00:02:17.400> you<00:02:18.400> go<00:02:18.580> into<00:02:20.010> the

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
proximal loop you go into the

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.590 
proximal loop you go into the
centripetal<00:02:21.400> coil<00:02:21.900> it<00:02:22.900> comes<00:02:23.110> all<00:02:23.350> the<00:02:23.380> way<00:02:23.500> in

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
centripetal coil it comes all the way in

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.850 
centripetal coil it comes all the way in
and<00:02:25.600> whenever<00:02:25.780> it<00:02:26.110> turns<00:02:26.350> back<00:02:26.590> on<00:02:26.799> itself

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
and whenever it turns back on itself

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.840 
and whenever it turns back on itself
right<00:02:27.430> here<00:02:27.819> this<00:02:28.450> is<00:02:28.660> a<00:02:28.690> central<00:02:29.110> flexure<00:02:29.850> so

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
right here this is a central flexure so

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.340 
right here this is a central flexure so
the<00:02:30.940> central<00:02:31.269> flexor<00:02:31.690> is<00:02:31.870> going<00:02:32.110> to<00:02:32.170> be<00:02:32.230> the

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
the central flexor is going to be the

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.310 
the central flexor is going to be the
point<00:02:32.530> where<00:02:32.769> it<00:02:32.860> comes<00:02:33.100> through<00:02:33.579> that<00:02:33.820> hat<00:02:34.320> so

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
point where it comes through that hat so

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.490 
point where it comes through that hat so
when<00:02:36.190> you<00:02:36.310> come<00:02:36.489> out<00:02:36.670> the<00:02:36.970> coil<00:02:37.180> out<00:02:37.500> right

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
when you come out the coil out right

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.060 
when you come out the coil out right
here<00:02:38.890> it's<00:02:39.760> going<00:02:39.910> to<00:02:39.970> follow<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:40.390> jejunum<00:02:41.070> is

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
here it's going to follow the jejunum is

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.430 
here it's going to follow the jejunum is
this<00:02:42.370> centrifugal<00:02:42.880> coil<00:02:43.359> and<00:02:43.989> this<00:02:44.140> is<00:02:44.290> when

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
this centrifugal coil and this is when

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.289 
this centrifugal coil and this is when
you<00:02:44.560> can<00:02:44.709> really<00:02:44.829> start<00:02:45.160> seeing<00:02:45.430> your<00:02:46.090> fecal

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
you can really start seeing your fecal

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:49.470 
you can really start seeing your fecal
balls<00:02:46.600> being<00:02:46.870> formed<00:02:47.730> so<00:02:48.730> it<00:02:48.880> follows<00:02:49.120> the

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
balls being formed so it follows the

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.420 
balls being formed so it follows the
jejunum<00:02:49.870> all<00:02:50.320> the<00:02:50.590> way<00:02:50.680> around

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
jejunum all the way around

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.649 
jejunum all the way around
and<00:02:53.379> you<00:02:54.379> end<00:02:54.530> up<00:02:54.709> here<00:02:55.010> at<00:02:55.730> your<00:02:55.909> distal<00:02:56.480> loop

00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:56.659 
and you end up here at your distal loop

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:59.380 
and you end up here at your distal loop
and<00:02:56.900> the<00:02:57.019> ascending<00:02:57.650> colon<00:02:57.909> so<00:02:58.909> this<00:02:59.090> is<00:02:59.120> going

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
and the ascending colon so this is going

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.020 
and the ascending colon so this is going
to<00:02:59.450> be<00:02:59.540> the<00:02:59.659> last<00:02:59.810> part<00:03:00.170> of<00:03:00.260> the<00:03:00.379> a<00:03:00.409> cynical<00:03:01.069> and

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
to be the last part of the a cynical and

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.360 
to be the last part of the a cynical and
one<00:03:02.569> way<00:03:02.900> to<00:03:02.959> find<00:03:03.260> this<00:03:03.469> did<00:03:03.890> you<00:03:04.010> know<00:03:04.129> that

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
one way to find this did you know that

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.030 
one way to find this did you know that
all<00:03:04.640> of<00:03:04.670> your<00:03:05.000> loops<00:03:05.750> are<00:03:06.560> going<00:03:06.739> to<00:03:06.799> be<00:03:06.859> right

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
all of your loops are going to be right

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.890 
all of your loops are going to be right
together<00:03:07.280> so<00:03:07.969> you've<00:03:08.120> got<00:03:08.150> the<00:03:08.510> sigmoid

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
together so you've got the sigmoid

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.190 
together so you've got the sigmoid

colon and the dissolute together so if

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:16.690 
colon and the dissolute together so if
you<00:03:14.750> know<00:03:14.930> the<00:03:15.109> difference<00:03:15.500> proximal<00:03:16.459> it<00:03:16.579> was

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
you know the difference proximal it was

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.309 
you know the difference proximal it was
going<00:03:16.849> to<00:03:16.909> be<00:03:16.969> very<00:03:17.060> large<00:03:17.389> like<00:03:17.810> the<00:03:17.959> season

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
going to be very large like the season

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:21.290 
going to be very large like the season
distillate<00:03:19.280> is<00:03:19.489> really<00:03:19.730> very

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
all right next to each other so from the

distal of a semicolon it's going to dive

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.780 
distal of a semicolon it's going to dive
across<00:03:31.350> the<00:03:31.680> body<00:03:31.860> which<00:03:32.190> is<00:03:32.340> really<00:03:32.490> hard<00:03:32.760> to

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
across the body which is really hard to

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.320 
across the body which is really hard to
speak<00:03:33.060> but<00:03:34.020> kind<00:03:34.350> of<00:03:34.500> right<00:03:34.740> in<00:03:34.770> here<00:03:35.190> you<00:03:36.090> see

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
speak but kind of right in here you see

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.220 
speak but kind of right in here you see
that<00:03:37.280> it's<00:03:38.280> about<00:03:38.400> two<00:03:38.700> to<00:03:38.850> three<00:03:38.880> inches<00:03:39.230> just

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
that it's about two to three inches just

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.020 
that it's about two to three inches just
where<00:03:40.470> it<00:03:40.560> translates<00:03:41.070> body<00:03:41.400> this<00:03:41.670> is<00:03:41.850> the

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
where it translates body this is the

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.830 
where it translates body this is the
transverse<00:03:43.310> colon<00:03:44.390> and<00:03:45.390> you<00:03:45.480> probably<00:03:45.660> will

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
transverse colon and you probably will

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.150 
transverse colon and you probably will
be<00:03:45.960> quiz<00:03:46.170> on<00:03:46.350> it<00:03:46.440> because<00:03:46.560> it's<00:03:46.770> really<00:03:46.980> hard

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
be quiz on it because it's really hard

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.710 
be quiz on it because it's really hard
to<00:03:47.220> tell<00:03:47.430> there's<00:03:47.640> no<00:03:47.790> difference<00:03:48.210> in<00:03:48.570> the

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
to tell there's no difference in the

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.210 
to tell there's no difference in the
fall<00:03:48.900> in<00:03:49.020> here<00:03:49.230> it's<00:03:49.740> just<00:03:49.800> a<00:03:49.980> matter<00:03:50.100> of

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
fall in here it's just a matter of

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.220 
fall in here it's just a matter of
changing<00:03:50.400> direction<00:03:50.760> so<00:03:51.630> that<00:03:51.660> you<00:03:51.930> can<00:03:52.110> go

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
changing direction so that you can go

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.240 
changing direction so that you can go
down<00:03:52.440> into<00:03:52.710> your<00:03:53.100> be<00:03:54.030> sending<00:03:54.540> going<00:03:55.260> this<00:03:56.070> is

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
down into your be sending going this is

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.210 
down into your be sending going this is
going<00:03:56.280> to<00:03:56.460> come<00:03:56.580> all<00:03:56.730> the<00:03:56.820> way<00:03:56.850> down<00:03:56.940> into<00:03:58.220> your

going to come all the way down into your

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.920 
going to come all the way down into your
