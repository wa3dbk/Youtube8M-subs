00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
no no no do not be fooled for this is a

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.190 
no no no do not be fooled for this is a
method<00:00:35.910> that's<00:00:36.000> already<00:00:36.300> put<00:00:36.600> into<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.989> game

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200

method that's already put into the game
right<00:00:37.980> so<00:00:38.370> think<00:00:38.610> about<00:00:38.700> it<00:00:38.850> when<00:00:39.059> you<00:00:39.090> first

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.299 
right so think about it when you first
bought<00:00:39.600> advanced<00:00:39.989> warfare<00:00:40.469> if<00:00:40.680> you<00:00:41.010> hadn't

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
bought advanced warfare if you hadn't

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
played call duty before you go and just
