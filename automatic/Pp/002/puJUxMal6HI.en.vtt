um<00:02:49.250> most<00:02:50.250> people<00:02:50.549> tend<00:02:50.879> to<00:02:51.000> focus<00:02:51.180> on

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
um most people tend to focus on

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.530 
um most people tend to focus on
Christianity<00:02:52.709> and<00:02:52.920> and<00:02:53.879> while<00:02:54.060> that<00:02:54.090> that

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
Christianity and and while that that

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.839 
Christianity and and while that that
makes<00:02:54.780> sense<00:02:55.049> to<00:02:55.290> me<00:02:55.440> at<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:56.430> end<00:02:56.459> of<00:02:56.640> the<00:02:56.700> day

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
makes sense to me at the end of the day

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:58.430 
makes sense to me at the end of the day
it<00:02:57.030> doesn't<00:02:57.060> make<00:02:57.420> sense<00:02:57.480> for<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:58.019> question

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
it doesn't make sense for the question

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.670 
it doesn't make sense for the question
as<00:02:58.620> a<00:02:58.650> whole<00:02:59.010> because<00:02:59.250> um<00:03:00.349> religion<00:03:01.349> started

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
as a whole because um religion started

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.520 
as a whole because um religion started
far<00:03:01.920> far<00:03:02.430> far<00:03:02.819> beyond<00:03:03.390> before<00:03:04.549> Christianity

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
far far far beyond before Christianity

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.080 
far far far beyond before Christianity
way<00:03:07.530> before<00:03:07.950> I<00:03:07.980> mean<00:03:08.220> you<00:03:08.609> know<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:08.760> original

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
way before I mean you know the original

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.930 
way before I mean you know the original
people<00:03:09.959> i'm<00:03:10.140> sure<00:03:10.170> they<00:03:10.500> worshiped<00:03:10.980> the<00:03:11.700> Sun

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.180 
people i'm sure they worshiped the Sun
and<00:03:12.269> the<00:03:12.329> grass<00:03:12.750> the<00:03:13.109> trees<00:03:13.140> they<00:03:13.859> worship

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
and the grass the trees they worship

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.149 
and the grass the trees they worship
whatever<00:03:14.400> made<00:03:14.760> sense<00:03:15.060> for<00:03:15.150> them<00:03:15.420> to<00:03:15.450> worship

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:16.159 
whatever made sense for them to worship

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:18.409 
whatever made sense for them to worship
you<00:03:17.159> know<00:03:17.250> and<00:03:17.400> you<00:03:17.579> got<00:03:17.730> all<00:03:17.819> the<00:03:17.940> Greek<00:03:18.150> gods

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:18.419

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:20.300 
you know and you got all the Greek gods
that<00:03:18.720> ship<00:03:18.930> they<00:03:19.470> really<00:03:19.799> worship<00:03:20.160> that

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
that ship they really worship that

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.069 
that ship they really worship that
that's<00:03:20.549> not<00:03:20.730> like<00:03:20.910> I<00:03:20.940> know<00:03:21.269> it's<00:03:21.480> a<00:03:21.540> myth<00:03:21.569> but

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
that's not like I know it's a myth but

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:24.289 
that's not like I know it's a myth but
it's<00:03:22.230> now<00:03:22.530> we<00:03:22.590> know<00:03:22.889> it<00:03:23.040> Smith<00:03:23.310> at<00:03:23.849> that<00:03:24.060> point

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
it's now we know it Smith at that point

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.240 
it's now we know it Smith at that point
they<00:03:24.510> really<00:03:24.810> worship<00:03:25.200> that<00:03:25.319> stuff<00:03:25.650> that<00:03:26.099> was

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
they really worship that stuff that was

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.449 
they really worship that stuff that was
real<00:03:26.549> to<00:03:26.760> them<00:03:26.940> and<00:03:27.239> so<00:03:27.870> you<00:03:28.739> know<00:03:28.829> it's<00:03:29.190> really

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
real to them and so you know it's really

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:30.920 
real to them and so you know it's really
interesting<00:03:29.730> to<00:03:29.940> think<00:03:30.030> about<00:03:30.269> the<00:03:30.540> notion

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
interesting to think about the notion

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.349 
interesting to think about the notion
that<00:03:30.959> what<00:03:31.470> would<00:03:31.560> this<00:03:31.680> world<00:03:31.889> be<00:03:32.010> like<00:03:32.099> so<00:03:32.519> my

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
that what would this world be like so my

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:36.580 
that what would this world be like so my
thoughts<00:03:33.690> are<00:03:33.959> no<00:03:34.410> what<00:03:35.160> would<00:03:35.250> it<00:03:35.370> be<00:03:35.400> like<00:03:35.459> so

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
thoughts are no what would it be like so

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.229 
thoughts are no what would it be like so
basically<00:03:37.590> a<00:03:37.829> lot<00:03:38.310> of<00:03:38.430> the<00:03:38.519> rules<00:03:38.760> a<00:03:38.970> lot<00:03:39.120> of

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
basically a lot of the rules a lot of

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.330 
basically a lot of the rules a lot of
the<00:03:39.329> ways<00:03:39.540> that<00:03:39.780> we<00:03:39.840> live<00:03:40.200> a<00:03:40.560> lot<00:03:41.129> of<00:03:41.250> the

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
and it's kind of interesting to think

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.550 
and it's kind of interesting to think
about<00:04:01.560> like<00:04:02.010> personally<00:04:02.819> if<00:04:03.060> you<00:04:03.930> ask<00:04:04.109> me<00:04:04.319> as<00:04:04.530> a

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
about like personally if you ask me as a

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.270 
about like personally if you ask me as a
whole<00:04:04.829> I<00:04:05.069> think<00:04:05.459> that<00:04:06.440> humanity<00:04:07.440> would<00:04:07.980> be

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
whole I think that humanity would be

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.099 
whole I think that humanity would be
done<00:04:08.730> we<00:04:09.329> wouldn't<00:04:09.569> make<00:04:09.720> it<00:04:09.780> without

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109 
done we wouldn't make it without

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:13.580 
done we wouldn't make it without
religion<00:04:10.680> um<00:04:10.889> I<00:04:11.690> think<00:04:12.690> that<00:04:12.900> we<00:04:13.139> would<00:04:13.349> have

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
religion um I think that we would have

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.349 
religion um I think that we would have
either<00:04:13.859> killed<00:04:14.430> one<00:04:14.579> another<00:04:14.609> because<00:04:15.120> there

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359 
either killed one another because there

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:17.390 
either killed one another because there
would<00:04:15.480> have<00:04:15.540> been<00:04:15.629> no<00:04:16.229> no<00:04:16.560> laws<00:04:16.769> are<00:04:17.070> not<00:04:17.099> good

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
would have been no no laws are not good

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.539 
would have been no no laws are not good
enough<00:04:17.609> laws<00:04:17.849> or<00:04:18.500> we<00:04:19.500> would<00:04:19.680> have<00:04:19.829> you<00:04:20.519> know

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
enough laws or we would have you know

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.209 
enough laws or we would have you know
without<00:04:20.880> the<00:04:21.049> don't<00:04:22.049> commit<00:04:22.260> adultery<00:04:22.590> and
