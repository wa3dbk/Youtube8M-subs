00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 modern batteries generally serve 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.319
 from 3 to 5 years depending on conditions 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.120
 battery hardest to operate 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.429
 occur during short urban 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.469
 especially in winter, they just donâ€™t 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.929
 have time to charge after launch 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.670
 cold engine and quickly lose 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.010
 terminal capacity before going to 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.279
 shop see what battery 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.859
 capacity for example our 55 ampere hours 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.439
 be sure to measure and record the length 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.470
 the width and height of the battery case and 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.480
 remember how its terminals are located 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.579
 data will be useful to us later 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.010
 start battery selection with capacity 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.620
 should be the same as the previous one 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.050
 recommended by the manufacturer 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.910
 consider if the indicator will be more 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.129
 the generator just can't handle it 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.710
 load and the battery will quickly order 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.480
 live long and not to charge the battery with 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.550
 too small capacity too 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.160
 will not last long but already because 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.079
 DC overcharging keep in mind in 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.780
 different batteries with the same 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.030
 capacity may vary significantly 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.280
 dimensions here and your records will be useful 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.650
 a unit with different sizes is simply not 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.600
 squeeze into its place if new 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.210
 batteries plus and minus will be located 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.280
 on the contrary, the standard power wires are not 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.009
 reach for terminals another important 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.960
 information date of issue battery term 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.970
 service does not start from the moment 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.280
 you put it in the car since in 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.380
 electrolyte was poured into the plant 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.360
 by all means ask the seller 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.560
 checked selected battery 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.900
 load fork 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.689
 if after five second test 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.909
 the device will show less than 9 volts demand 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.680
 replacements and do not forget the warranty when 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.320
 purchase, check the correctness 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.930
 fill out the warranty card and keep 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.990
 him with a check 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.470
 accuracy will facilitate replacement 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.600
 poor quality product 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.119
 here are your own tricks when choosing 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.860
 and replacing the battery by the way old not 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.110
 need to throw out anywhere in it 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.230
 contained 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.000
 poisonous lead and acid and in the receiver 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:02.080
 paragraph for him you can even get 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.080
 some money
