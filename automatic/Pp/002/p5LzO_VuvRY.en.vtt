00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 Hello you and welcome 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.920
 to a new video of games 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.040
 toys 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.800
 I present you today the aqua cent or 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.019
 he also made aqua sand before he is 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.839
 from youtube josi and suitable for children 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.119
 four years and that's really one 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:22.020
 magical sand that never gets wet 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:25.019
 supposedly you can put it under water 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.580
 pour out and when you get the sand out 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.380
 he takes it dry again 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.460
 So it's a kind of lotus effect 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.530
 I think there is used what you 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.210
 it takes a glass jar 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.610
 best so that you can look through it 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.489
 that one leads with water and then 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.680
 you can start already 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:45.059
 I would say we look at that 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.300
 Just take a closer look I have that 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.550
 never done so before 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.039
 let's go now we have our nacua cent 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.340
 Unpacked these three parts were 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:59.010
 once contain the bottle where the sand 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.859
 it's still up here is one more 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.090
 tower that then as a funnel to 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.400
 put the sand back in the bottle 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.369
 then we have one more here 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:12.330
 donation behind such a very fine 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:15.570
 sieve is or a kind of shovel for the 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.820
 sand and here a gis no essay 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.310
 you can then these two 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.330
 Swap attachments and then completely 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.119
 build fine structures so then we need 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:31.229
 Now a container with water 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:32.970
 I just have a sweet here 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.579
 You can also have a casserole dish 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.930
 take or a salad bowl 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:38.250
 the main thing is that she is made of glass then can 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.680
 the whole thing a bit better 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.950
 with tracking and then we start too 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.079
 we have the current one open now 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.590
 showing her you again here because so 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.700
 I have a piece of aluminum foil over it 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.860
 now stabbed 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.860
 then we sit our tower on it 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:01.420
 and pour the aqua sand into ours 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:03.759
 Water Vessel as it is located 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.070
 a little acar cent on the 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:09.130
 surface but most of it is in 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:12.509
 our glass jar on the floor and me 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.509
 Change servicekit now just one tower 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:19.330
 and then take our watering cans 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.610
 tower and that's right 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.170
 cool that you then us so 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.690
 bit worm-like but this one 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:30.510
 watering can tower which really quite 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:37.140
 cool under water is cultures 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:37.140
 I've already overturned that 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.519
 So really cool, I have no idea 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.780
 how that works but it is 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.180
 really fascinating 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.549
 I'll use our shovel now 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.660
 here and try the sand there 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:52.750
 rauszuholen 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.970
 and actually the sand is right 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:58.360
 dry as if he never with 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:01.870
 Water came in contact with us 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.700
 very blatant I mean again the 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.840
 get sand out and put it back in this one 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.870
 empathize with the bottle 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.970
 I will then turn the tower over 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.340
 around now looks a bit like a 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:15.579
 funnel he is also and fill 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:18.420
 this sand back on to him even then 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:18.420
 to use 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:37.459
 and that's really cool you can see 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:40.099
 so individual water pearls on the sand 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.599
 but they do not feed it is possible 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:47.840
 such a lotus effect it almost looks 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:49.430
 Like glass beads the press in the simplest 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.000
 from our country from now on something 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.769
 danebengegangen 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.900
 I have now most of the aqua 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:59.390
 scavenged from the water and we 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:07.130
 Just start here again 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:09.829
 aqua cent bottle now I have the times 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.690
 used sand above the water and 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:14.860
 then our tower collapsed me 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.970
 now can not get such beautiful coral 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:21.169
 I do not think so 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:24.010
 just there are any on the train 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:28.450
 to make figures out of it 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:31.160
 In any case, really fascinating 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:34.430
 I hope my video to aqua scenes has 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:38.270
 you like again here a result 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:41.479
 try our aqua cent up here 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:43.240
 then the crystalline one, so to speak 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:45.470
 the water surface 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.090
 if you liked the video give 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.280
 me high but leave a thumb 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.870
 me a nice comments and forget 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:54.550
 Of course not to subscribe to the channel 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.550
 See you next time
