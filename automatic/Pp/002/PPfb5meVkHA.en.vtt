above<00:04:56.380> this<00:04:56.530> truck<00:04:56.800> boneyard<00:04:57.580> we're<00:04:57.730> actually

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
above this truck boneyard we're actually

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.900 
above this truck boneyard we're actually
going<00:04:58.090> to<00:04:58.290> give<00:04:59.290> you<00:04:59.410> a<00:04:59.530> test<00:05:00.130> of<00:05:00.370> what<00:05:00.820> the

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
going to give you a test of what the

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:02.400 
going to give you a test of what the
multi<00:05:01.150> trains<00:05:01.390> like<00:05:01.570> can<00:05:01.780> do<00:05:01.900> which<00:05:02.080> you<00:05:02.200> are

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
multi trains like can do which you are

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:03.780 
multi trains like can do which you are
currently<00:05:02.770> in<00:05:03.040> right<00:05:03.190> now<00:05:03.340> so<00:05:03.550> that<00:05:03.670> means

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:03.790 
currently in right now so that means

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:05.940 
currently in right now so that means
you're<00:05:04.030> in<00:05:04.120> control<00:05:04.450> and<00:05:04.990> then<00:05:05.320> later<00:05:05.560> halfway

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:05.950 
you're in control and then later halfway

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.260 
you're in control and then later halfway
through<00:05:06.130> the<00:05:06.220> course<00:05:06.430> reaction<00:05:06.910> to<00:05:07.000> throw<00:05:07.210> it

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
through the course reaction to throw it

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.930 
through the course reaction to throw it
into<00:05:07.390> crawl<00:05:07.720> control<00:05:07.870> so<00:05:08.770> that<00:05:08.980> you<00:05:09.190> can<00:05:09.340> test

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
into crawl control so that you can test

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.150 
into crawl control so that you can test
it<00:05:10.060> out<00:05:10.150> and<00:05:10.300> see<00:05:10.450> how<00:05:10.570> well<00:05:11.110> you're<00:05:11.320> able<00:05:11.980> to

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160

focus<00:05:12.520> on<00:05:13.180> steering<00:05:13.780> and<00:05:13.930> let<00:05:14.020> the<00:05:14.260> basically

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
focus on steering and let the basically

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.370 
focus on steering and let the basically
the<00:05:15.370> truck<00:05:15.580> drive<00:05:15.850> itself<00:05:16.150> in<00:05:16.360> a<00:05:16.420> way<00:05:16.510> and<00:05:16.870> the

the truck drive itself in a way and the

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.980 
the truck drive itself in a way and the
Koala<00:05:17.650> mode<00:05:17.920> will<00:05:18.220> blow<00:05:18.460> anyone<00:05:19.000> away<00:05:19.270> it's

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
Koala mode will blow anyone away it's

for me kind of like four wheeling for

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.380 
for me kind of like four wheeling for
dummies<00:05:29.250> we're<00:05:30.250> going<00:05:30.370> to<00:05:30.430> engage<00:05:30.730> crawl

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:31.390 
dummies we're going to engage crawl

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.140 
the brake or the throttle so you just
focus<00:05:38.320> on<00:05:38.530> steering<00:05:38.950> okay<00:05:39.400> alright<00:05:39.730> so<00:05:39.760> it's

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.150 
focus on steering okay alright so it's

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.210 
focus on steering okay alright so it's
like<00:05:40.270> almost<00:05:40.450> like<00:05:40.660> autopilot<00:05:40.990> yep<00:05:41.800> I'm<00:05:41.950> just
