00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:06.810
 while sad while taking a shot 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.090
 says the referee stops the game 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:23.070
 mystic waits for a moment before 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:26.369
 stop it from shoveling away come to ma 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.439
 review the theft the layup bottom of 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.449
 men's which allowed ferrara 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.260
 return to a single possession of distance 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.629
 I also like to emphasize 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.050
 and the very small controversy that stands for 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:40.280
 born on the episode has been turned off 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.469
 basically from a hug a 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.260
 furlani of scarcia look I wanted to tell you 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:47.089
 I was lucky in my career 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.879
 play some event similar to 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:51.799
 this not only in Italy and I have to 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:53.570
 tell you that the chivalrous climate that exists 

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:54.799
 among all the participants the players 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.199
 coaches in a situation 

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:59.869
 positively in tension because it is there 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.339
 is playing an important appointment 

00:00:59.869 --> 00:01:03.469
 a truly admirable season a 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:05.899
 compliment all compliment then 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:08.289
 we have to reply for what 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:10.909
 buscaglia built in these seasons 

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:14.539
 sure tool with the help of the company 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:17.149
 allowed him to pursue a dream a 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:21.649
 project and that step by step and I am 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:23.840
 shipped steps is creating a reality that 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:24.640
 objectively he begins to be indignant 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.370
 senses 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.130
 I do 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:31.680
 I do not think that we have created we have witnessed 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.590
 there is a very footballing thing now 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.060
 the return of the ball as it happens 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.280
 every now and then among the civilian teams 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.280
 the episode usually shoots 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:49.200
 I used it to repeat that 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.330
 what he was saying about the episode 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.040
 previous look I make a connection 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.870
 more politics in Italy and abroad by 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.730
 twenty years I did not meditate on that 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:59.550
 I believe this is what happened 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:01.200
 there is the return the two points by 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.760
 of a team that could also 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.040
 paradoxically I don't want to bring everyone 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.780
 but none lose d1 d2 the end 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.730
 counterpart is an example of civilization 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.350
 that ennobles all this manifestation 

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:12.350
 with food for everyone
