00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.450
 to 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:08.980
 hi how are we here in a new 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.780
 video in minecraft to learn how to do 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:14.889
 the next thing that is an original idea 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:16.869
 very very good mine I take the credit 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:20.320
 may have invented this because I do not 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:23.289
 I've seen anywhere else I do not think 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.869
 that no one has invented it yet 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:29.260
 that I took the credit for that is a 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:31.480
 Jacuzzi created by me obviously not as 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.760
 was saying that for example they can 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:38.640
 do it as deep as you want but 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.640
 one when entering the water without the witches 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:45.030
 how the steam comes out of the warm water 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.030
 the bubbles 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.750
 and I love it 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.760
 all right 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.699
 it's a pretty seed idea 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.400
 at 17 months and the third nobody is going to 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:02.440
 learn how to do this 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.230
 then let's go on the other side of the 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.100
 wall and here we are going to ask you to us 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.970
 give what we need 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.970
 Quick 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.230
 and there we are 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.110
 let's see let's start let's do 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:20.680
 first do a little bit here 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:24.220
 also a hole the floor two blocks 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:27.400
 of height so I repeat the way that 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:30.610
 I'm doing is if we have left of this 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.830
 way now we get this out of here not be 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.990
 using never never luck 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.720
 because then at the bottom of the pool 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.880
 what remains with the lava 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.030
 to here we put side 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:47.439
 and now we put water right next to 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:49.700
 it does not become oxidized and since 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:52.369
 the and suspended 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.539
 super logical and now we put the 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:59.380
 next form subtract it if we put it 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:59.380
 our two beautiful 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.600
 our beautiful re peter 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.000
 and behind three seconds I 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.390
 you repeat without delaying anything we do not have 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.370
 well two others repeat seeing each other is already a 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.510
 new stroke and another repeats looking at the 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:20.230
 opposite side and with 31 of delay now 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:24.000
 we join them and now we have some other 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.000
 lever here to do this 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:34.340
 and this could also be another clip 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.340
 for me 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.220
 come now let's do the same thing 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.920
 other side 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:49.630
 so that it has a wider surface 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:52.630
 and smoke out over a larger area 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:55.820
 and so the pool can be bigger 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.540
 you understand me so let's repeat the 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:03.019
 same process 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.019
 but this time the lake repeats itself 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:10.200
 then if we have the other side three 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.900
 seconds and we join them 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:16.220
 what remains to be done now let's fill 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.220
 everything first 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:22.030
 yes yes filling the holes 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:30.160
 and now if we put our crystals 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:32.310
 so they can go through so the 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:36.340
 smoke trap can go through what would be 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:38.680
 that the water can not be seen 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.730
 and put this because in this way we do not 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.069
 we burn 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:46.250
 and you can pass the smoke good now let's go 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:48.670
 to use let's do what would be the 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:55.050
 pool we will use 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:55.050
 in this case what of how this is 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:04.780
 lady the name 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:04.780
 irons as it is iron and it is 

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:14.110
 so now we surround the entire structure 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:17.290
 because he aaiÃºn in the Gironde another of 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:19.920
 mother I was the name iron 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.880
 being white like that is pretty good 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.340
 representing a pool and good here 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:27.240
 we have in our pool more or less 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.740
 Now you have to fill it with water 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.650
 because if without water it is not a pool and 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.060
 less a lake if once this is done 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.300
 let's do the following we are going to 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:40.780
 extend what else we are going to do to be 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:43.039
 make this beautiful pool 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.900
 only aesthetically we are going to do 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:48.320
 make it better 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.750
 so I also give some ideas to 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.900
 your 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:54.460
 well now let's place the orders 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:58.300
 blocks over here 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:05:02.440
 surrounding so that they are like a top not 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:05.230
 so it's starting to get dark and so 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.300
 We leave a way out and what good now 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:09.430
 is left to do is the switch 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:11.980
 have every time it's day and by 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:16.560
 Reader's magic was made of good day 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:17.969
 now what to join these two for what 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.459
 with 

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:22.639
 with a torch what is done barely 

00:05:20.459 --> 00:05:25.909
 let's do what 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:28.909
 if the torch of forgiveness the lever is 

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:31.560
 here is not to make them turn on at 

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:33.380
 go through there the following 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:38.030
 yes 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:40.440
 this is only with passing all the 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:42.840
 subtract here 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.849
 and having a distance block this 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:49.319
 It does not turn on 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:54.919
 and we are well ready then now it is 

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:54.919
 simply with quickly the lever 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:07.950
 but have been adopted already if it is not that 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:10.020
 do not want for things 

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:12.810
 well learned in the stream or 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:14.190
 turn it off you did not go to pay the 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:16.700
 first current 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:19.580
 the bubbles go out 

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:24.020
 Well I hope you liked it and also 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:27.670
 IFAB served comment and subscribe 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.670
 see you until the next goodbye
