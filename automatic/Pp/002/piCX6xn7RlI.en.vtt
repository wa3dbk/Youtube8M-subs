00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
across a training ax 180 s however if

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.560 
across a training ax 180 s however if
you<00:00:22.439> play<00:00:22.800> on<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.340> wii<00:00:23.490> then<00:00:23.910> you<00:00:24.119> need<00:00:24.390> to

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
you play on the wii then you need to

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.790 
you play on the wii then you need to
have<00:00:25.109> all<00:00:25.140> analog<00:00:26.070> all<00:00:26.460> red<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.119> white<00:00:27.330> I

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
have all analog all red and white I

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.620 
have all analog all red and white I
forget<00:00:28.800> whether<00:00:29.160> that's<00:00:29.539> component<00:00:30.539> or

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
forget whether that's component or

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.720 
forget whether that's component or
composite<00:00:30.660> but<00:00:31.349> anyways<00:00:31.800> you<00:00:32.130> need<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.489> have

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
composite but anyways you need to have

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.350 
composite but anyways you need to have
that<00:00:32.759> in<00:00:33.660> order<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.649> get<00:00:34.770> audio<00:00:35.219> because<00:00:35.969> it

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
that in order to get audio because it

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.450 
that in order to get audio because it
takes<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.960> run<00:00:37.079> white<00:00:37.290> whereas<00:00:37.620> Xbox<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:38.309> can

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
takes to run white whereas Xbox you can

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.920 
takes to run white whereas Xbox you can
have<00:00:38.579> digital<00:00:39.770> so<00:00:41.180> that's<00:00:42.180> what<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.660> trends

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
have digital so that's what the trends

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.549 
have digital so that's what the trends
ax<00:00:43.469> 180<00:00:43.860> s<00:00:44.010> have<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.640> they<00:00:45.239> what's<00:00:45.989> nice<00:00:46.230> is

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
ax 180 s have and they what's nice is

output<00:01:46.920> from<00:01:47.220> your<00:01:47.490> TV<00:01:47.790> which<00:01:48.479> gives<00:01:48.869> you<00:01:49.140> a

output from your TV which gives you a

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:56.300 
output from your TV which gives you a
very<00:01:50.759> limited<00:01:51.149> audio<00:01:53.869> response<00:01:54.979> caused<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.009> lot

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
very limited audio response caused a lot

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.310 
very limited audio response caused a lot
of<00:01:56.340> things<00:01:56.579> get<00:01:56.850> drowned<00:01:57.149> out<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.689> then<00:01:58.079> i

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
of things get drowned out and then i

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.219 
of things get drowned out and then i
went<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.950> more<00:01:59.850> of<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.090> surround<00:02:00.540> sound<00:02:00.719> with

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
went to more of a surround sound with

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.609 
went to more of a surround sound with
speakers<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.100> this<00:02:02.490> allowed<00:02:02.850> me<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.619> hear

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
speakers and this allowed me to hear

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.180 
speakers and this allowed me to hear
some<00:02:05.219> enemy<00:02:05.579> footsteps<00:02:05.939> and<00:02:06.540> it<00:02:07.170> gave<00:02:07.950> the

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
some enemy footsteps and it gave the

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.720 
some enemy footsteps and it gave the
game<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.720> lot<00:02:09.720> better<00:02:09.959> bass<00:02:10.319> sound<00:02:10.730> however

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
game a lot better bass sound however

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.840 
game a lot better bass sound however
then<00:02:12.569> i<00:02:12.840> looked<00:02:13.379> into

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
then i looked into

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.020 
then i looked into
phones<00:02:14.120> and<00:02:14.330> I<00:02:14.660> bought<00:02:14.930> a<00:02:14.960> pair<00:02:15.290> of<00:02:15.350> mine<00:02:15.530> and

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
phones and I bought a pair of mine and

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.630 
phones and I bought a pair of mine and
what<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:17.240> headphones<00:02:18.080> do<00:02:18.410> is<00:02:18.710> I<00:02:18.770> think<00:02:19.100> they

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
what the headphones do is I think they

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.910 
what the headphones do is I think they
get<00:02:20.420> are<00:02:20.630> better<00:02:21.050> for<00:02:21.380> hearing<00:02:21.710> footsteps

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
get are better for hearing footsteps

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.370 
get are better for hearing footsteps
because<00:02:22.610> with<00:02:22.850> the<00:02:23.030> speaker's<00:02:23.660> i<00:02:23.840> could<00:02:24.110> hear

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
because with the speaker's i could hear

using<00:02:50.750> that<00:02:51.080> and<00:02:51.700> another<00:02:52.700> thing<00:02:52.820> that<00:02:53.510> over

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
using that and another thing that over

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.120 
using that and another thing that over
his<00:02:55.430> regular<00:02:56.090> audio<00:02:56.570> that<00:02:57.530> the<00:02:57.680> headphones

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
his regular audio that the headphones

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.020 
his regular audio that the headphones
provide<00:02:58.670> is<00:02:58.940> a<00:02:59.330> sense<00:02:59.780> of<00:02:59.900> direction<00:03:00.110> in<00:03:01.030> that

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
provide is a sense of direction in that

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.320 
provide is a sense of direction in that

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
it's coming straight at you you know

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.010 
it's coming straight at you you know
like<00:03:08.570> a<00:03:08.600> straight<00:03:09.080> line<00:03:09.410> so<00:03:10.190> the<00:03:10.370> audio<00:03:10.820> as<00:03:11.150> the

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
like a straight line so the audio as the
