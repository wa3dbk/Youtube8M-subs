00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
lot of people out to do it okay I don't

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.560 
lot of people out to do it okay I don't
know<00:01:16.740> why<00:01:16.860> I'm<00:01:16.979> talking<00:01:17.130> about<00:01:17.340> this<00:01:17.640> but<00:01:18.390> this

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
know why I'm talking about this but this

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.289 
know why I'm talking about this but this
is<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.869> finishing<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.470> base<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:20.100> I<00:01:21.030> might

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
is the finishing of the base and I might

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.149 
is the finishing of the base and I might
because<00:01:22.200> they're<00:01:22.380> not<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.530> lot<00:01:22.680> of<00:01:22.710> people<00:01:23.040> are

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
because they're not a lot of people are

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.609 
because they're not a lot of people are
doing<00:01:23.280> son<00:01:23.610> basis<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.330> I<00:01:24.750> might<00:01:25.229> make<00:01:25.380> one

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
doing son basis and I might make one

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.530 
doing son basis and I might make one
eventually<00:01:26.070> i'll<00:01:26.549> probably<00:01:26.790> will<00:01:27.090> make<00:01:27.330> one

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
eventually i'll probably will make one

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.950 
eventually i'll probably will make one
again<00:01:28.290> but<00:01:28.890> make<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.270> i'm<00:01:30.270> not<00:01:30.479> going<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.659> say

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
again but make it i'm not going to say

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.960 
again but make it i'm not going to say
how<00:01:31.170> I'm<00:01:31.259> gonna<00:01:31.380> make<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.799> i'm<00:01:32.549> gonna<00:01:32.729> make<00:01:32.909> it

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
how I'm gonna make it i'm gonna make it

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.620 
how I'm gonna make it i'm gonna make it
so<00:01:33.150> people<00:01:34.009> I<00:01:35.009> pride<00:01:35.909> this<00:01:36.090> in<00:01:36.299> single<00:01:36.600> player

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
so people I pride this in single player

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.899 
so people I pride this in single player
and<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.710> literally<00:01:38.009> took<00:01:38.280> me<00:01:38.430> about<00:01:38.610> two<00:01:38.880> hours

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
and it literally took me about two hours

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.740 
and it literally took me about two hours
to<00:01:39.240> get<00:01:39.450> through<00:01:39.659> widow<00:01:39.960> ever<00:01:40.229> so<00:01:41.509> you'll<00:01:42.509> see

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
to get through widow ever so you'll see

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.710 
to get through widow ever so you'll see
when<00:01:42.960> I<00:01:42.990> do<00:01:43.140> eventually<00:01:43.500> make<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.009> base<00:01:44.159> and

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
when I do eventually make the base and

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.870 
when I do eventually make the base and
you'll<00:01:45.720> i<00:01:45.990> will<00:01:46.500> probably<00:01:46.740> reveal<00:01:47.340> how<00:01:47.579> i<00:01:47.610> made

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
you'll i will probably reveal how i made

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.069 
you'll i will probably reveal how i made
