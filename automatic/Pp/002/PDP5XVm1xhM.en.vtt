all<00:00:13.469> right<00:00:13.830> and<00:00:14.129> continuing<00:00:15.000> you're<00:00:15.540> gonna

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
all right and continuing you're gonna

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:22.600 
all right and continuing you're gonna
have<00:00:15.929> to<00:00:16.139> use<00:00:16.410> your<00:00:19.340> energy<00:00:20.340> tank<00:00:20.640> injection

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:22.610 
have to use your energy tank injection

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:39.770 
have to use your energy tank injection
corruption<00:00:23.610> mode<00:00:24.079> to<00:00:25.079> get<00:00:25.470> through<00:00:25.770> here

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.420 

and<00:00:40.780> with<00:00:41.290> the<00:00:41.440> energy<00:00:41.950> tank<00:00:42.480> corruption<00:00:43.480> mode

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
and with the energy tank corruption mode

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.240 
and with the energy tank corruption mode
it<00:00:45.430> will<00:00:45.520> actually<00:00:45.989> use<00:00:46.989> a<00:00:47.020> tank<00:00:47.559> of<00:00:47.769> health<00:00:48.010> if

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
it will actually use a tank of health if

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.580 
it will actually use a tank of health if
you<00:00:48.370> stay<00:00:48.579> in<00:00:48.730> it<00:00:48.820> the<00:00:48.970> whole<00:00:49.120> time<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:50.379> then

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 
you stay in it the whole time and then

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.889 
you stay in it the whole time and then
whatever<00:00:50.769> you<00:00:51.070> exit<00:00:51.579> with<00:00:51.760> it<00:00:52.540> takes<00:00:52.750> that

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:52.899 
whatever you exit with it takes that

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:57.860 
whatever you exit with it takes that
much<00:00:53.079> health<00:00:53.350> away

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.709 

I<00:00:57.930> guess<00:00:58.559> it's<00:00:58.710> called<00:00:58.890> hyper<00:00:59.100> mode<00:00:59.719> but

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
I guess it's called hyper mode but

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.500 
I guess it's called hyper mode but
you're<00:01:01.500> gonna<00:01:01.590> want<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.860> use<00:01:01.980> it<00:01:02.100> here<00:01:02.510> just

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
you're gonna want to use it here just

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:22.800 
you're gonna want to use it here just

see<00:01:23.810> how<00:01:23.900> quick<00:01:24.170> and<00:01:24.350> easy<00:01:24.440> that<00:01:24.650> was

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.850 

and<00:01:33.860> always<00:01:34.070> in<00:01:34.340> doing<00:01:34.610> a<00:01:34.670> charged<00:01:34.940> shot<00:01:35.000> will

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
and always in doing a charged shot will

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.149 
and always in doing a charged shot will
bring<00:01:36.860> health<00:01:37.610> and<00:01:37.909> miss<00:01:38.540> Lipp<00:01:38.860> miss<00:01:39.860> little

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
bring health and miss Lipp miss little

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.810 
bring health and miss Lipp miss little
packs<00:01:40.520> toward<00:01:41.270> you<00:01:41.710> so<00:01:42.710> if<00:01:42.770> you<00:01:42.950> can't<00:01:43.220> reach<00:01:43.670> a

head back you see this funky rock and
you<00:02:09.429> can<00:02:09.580> blow<00:02:09.789> that<00:02:10.000> up<00:02:10.380> more<00:02:11.380> fall<00:02:11.680> into<00:02:11.980> here

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
you can blow that up more fall into here

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.740 
you can blow that up more fall into here
and<00:02:14.230> these<00:02:14.410> little<00:02:14.560> buggy<00:02:14.890> things<00:02:15.750> will

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
and these little buggy things will

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
and these little buggy things will
attach<00:02:17.739> to<00:02:17.980> you<00:02:19.110> and<00:02:20.670> let<00:02:21.670> you<00:02:21.760> float<00:02:22.590> so<00:02:23.590> watch

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
attach to you and let you float so watch

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.460 
attach to you and let you float so watch
out<00:02:23.950> for<00:02:24.069> this<00:02:24.160> monster<00:02:24.430> that<00:02:24.819> I<00:02:24.850> just<00:02:25.060> got

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.060 

and<00:02:39.670> then<00:02:39.790> as<00:02:40.000> soon<00:02:40.240> as<00:02:40.330> you<00:02:40.450> get<00:02:40.540> to<00:02:40.600> the<00:02:40.780> top

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
and then as soon as you get to the top

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.760 
and then as soon as you get to the top
you<00:02:42.070> can<00:02:42.540> do<00:02:43.540> a<00:02:43.570> little<00:02:43.840> bomb<00:02:44.110> to<00:02:44.140> get<00:02:44.590> those

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
you can do a little bomb to get those

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.630 
you can do a little bomb to get those
guys<00:02:45.010> off<00:02:45.250> yet<00:02:46.440> and<00:02:47.440> there's<00:02:48.220> a<00:02:48.250> missile

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
guys off yet and there's a missile

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.210 
guys off yet and there's a missile
expansion<00:02:52.650> every<00:02:53.650> time<00:02:53.830> you<00:02:53.920> get<00:02:54.040> one<00:02:54.190> of

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
expansion every time you get one of

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.560 
expansion every time you get one of
those<00:02:54.400> that's<00:02:54.700> one<00:02:54.880> percent<00:02:55.270> of<00:02:55.330> the<00:02:55.420> game

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
those that's one percent of the game

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:02.700 
those that's one percent of the game
done<00:02:55.840> so<00:02:56.800> you're<00:02:57.310> well<00:02:57.550> on<00:02:57.580> your<00:02:57.760> way<00:03:01.560> rip<00:03:02.560> this

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:02.710 
done so you're well on your way rip this

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:03.570 
done so you're well on your way rip this
thing<00:03:02.980> open

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
thing open

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.700 
thing open
glasses<00:03:04.000> charge<00:03:04.420> die<00:03:04.890> and<00:03:07.260> we<00:03:08.260> get<00:03:08.470> a<00:03:08.500> new

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:08.710 
glasses charge die and we get a new

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:19.230 
glasses charge die and we get a new
ability

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:19.240 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:28.120 

oh<00:03:20.130> yeah

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.730 

the<00:03:29.130> graph<00:03:29.400> will<00:03:29.640> swing<00:03:29.970> it's<00:03:30.810> very<00:03:31.080> nice

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:31.740 
the graph will swing it's very nice

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:37.190 
the graph will swing it's very nice
so<00:03:32.270> just<00:03:33.440> hold<00:03:34.440> down<00:03:34.560> Z<00:03:35.100> and<00:03:35.510> you<00:03:36.510> will<00:03:36.660> grapple

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
so just hold down Z and you will grapple

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:49.059 
so just hold down Z and you will grapple
and<00:03:37.290> swing<00:03:38.240> so<00:03:39.240> now<00:03:39.360> you<00:03:39.420> just<00:03:39.510> want<00:03:39.750> to

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.390 
and then when you get to this other side

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.970 
and then when you get to this other side
you<00:04:34.390> can<00:04:34.570> just<00:04:34.600> start<00:04:35.020> grappling<00:04:35.380> off<00:04:35.740> these
