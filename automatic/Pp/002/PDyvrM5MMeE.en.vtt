00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.250 

I<00:00:06.140> think<00:00:06.590> that<00:00:07.120> this<00:00:08.120> is<00:00:08.300> the<00:00:08.420> perfect<00:00:08.630> thesis

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:09.260 
I think that this is the perfect thesis

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.670 
I think that this is the perfect thesis
it's<00:00:09.940> really<00:00:10.940> it<00:00:11.420> was<00:00:11.600> really<00:00:11.630> made<00:00:12.260> by<00:00:12.469> us

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:12.680 
it's really it was really made by us

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.010 
it's really it was really made by us
it's<00:00:13.309> the<00:00:13.730> culmination<00:00:13.969> of<00:00:14.510> your<00:00:14.660> training

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:15.020 
it's the culmination of your training

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.920 
it's the culmination of your training
but<00:00:15.350> it's<00:00:15.500> also<00:00:15.680> the<00:00:16.190> first<00:00:16.490> real<00:00:17.480> production

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:17.930 
but it's also the first real production

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.260 
but it's also the first real production
that<00:00:18.230> we<00:00:18.320> get<00:00:18.470> to<00:00:18.619> do<00:00:18.740> so<00:00:19.010> it<00:00:19.130> it's<00:00:19.940> sort<00:00:20.210> of

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:20.270 
that we get to do so it it's sort of

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.170 
that we get to do so it it's sort of
like<00:00:20.390> a<00:00:20.420> bridge<00:00:20.720> also<00:00:21.160> so<00:00:22.160> it's<00:00:22.400> nice<00:00:22.610> it<00:00:22.970> feels

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180 
like a bridge also so it's nice it feels

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.890 
like a bridge also so it's nice it feels
like<00:00:23.420> we're<00:00:23.660> easing<00:00:24.050> the<00:00:24.860> transition<00:00:25.010> between

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:25.900 
like we're easing the transition between

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.630 
like we're easing the transition between
training<00:00:26.900> and<00:00:27.170> professional<00:00:27.410> work<00:00:27.980> the

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
training and professional work the

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:29.950 
training and professional work the
different<00:00:29.060> actors<00:00:29.360> would<00:00:29.570> bring<00:00:29.780> in

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:29.960 
different actors would bring in

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.540 
different actors would bring in
different<00:00:30.500> things<00:00:30.650> we<00:00:30.800> wanted<00:00:31.010> to<00:00:31.100> do<00:00:31.280> so

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
different things we wanted to do so

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.940 
different things we wanted to do so

songs or material from different plays
that<00:00:34.219> were<00:00:34.280> already<00:00:34.700> written<00:00:35.090> by<00:00:35.510> Shakespeare

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
that were already written by Shakespeare

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.430 
that were already written by Shakespeare
or<00:00:36.739> Shaw<00:00:36.950> or<00:00:37.340> we<00:00:38.120> some<00:00:38.960> things<00:00:39.140> were<00:00:39.290> written

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
or Shaw or we some things were written

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.710 
or Shaw or we some things were written
by<00:00:40.100> us<00:00:40.280> this<00:00:40.579> is<00:00:40.700> one<00:00:40.880> of<00:00:40.970> those<00:00:41.090> things<00:00:41.360> where

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:41.720 
by us this is one of those things where

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.460 
by us this is one of those things where
a<00:00:41.990> situation<00:00:42.860> comes<00:00:43.220> up<00:00:43.490> and<00:00:44.090> suddenly<00:00:44.470> up

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:45.470 
a situation comes up and suddenly up

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.340 
a situation comes up and suddenly up
comes<00:00:45.890> a<00:00:46.100> rather<00:00:46.310> brilliant<00:00:46.820> notion<00:00:47.750> which

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
comes a rather brilliant notion which

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.260 
comes a rather brilliant notion which
would<00:00:48.590> have<00:00:48.829> lain<00:00:49.040> dormant<00:00:49.310> otherwise<00:00:49.970> I

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
would have lain dormant otherwise I

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.220 
would have lain dormant otherwise I
think<00:00:50.570> it<00:00:50.870> was<00:00:50.989> and<00:00:51.950> it<00:00:52.070> was<00:00:52.220> entirely<00:00:52.579> in

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
think it was and it was entirely in

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.760 
think it was and it was entirely in
reaction<00:00:54.230> to<00:00:54.380> in<00:00:54.500> response<00:00:54.980> to<00:00:56.320> the<00:00:57.320> ideas<00:00:57.649> of

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
reaction to in response to the ideas of

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.680 
reaction to in response to the ideas of
Joan<00:00:57.980> are<00:00:58.130> so<00:00:58.370> huge<00:00:58.700> that<00:00:58.970> to<00:00:59.090> split<00:00:59.360> them<00:00:59.510> into

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
Joan are so huge that to split them into

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.620 
Joan are so huge that to split them into
ten<00:01:00.230> women<00:01:00.559> means<00:01:00.800> you<00:01:00.980> just<00:01:01.190> have<00:01:01.340> that<00:01:01.850> many

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:02.630 
ten women means you just have that many

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.749 
ten women means you just have that many
more<00:01:02.750> ideas<00:01:02.930> for<00:01:03.410> one<00:01:03.590> character<00:01:03.950> she's<00:01:04.519> kind

00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:04.759 
more ideas for one character she's kind

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:06.280 
more ideas for one character she's kind
of<00:01:04.820> women<00:01:05.149> that<00:01:05.180> we<00:01:05.360> don't<00:01:05.570> see<00:01:05.810> anymore

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
of women that we don't see anymore

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.609 
of women that we don't see anymore
so<00:01:06.649> to<00:01:06.710> split<00:01:07.310> that<00:01:07.490> down<00:01:07.820> and<00:01:08.149> make<00:01:08.619> women

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
so to split that down and make women

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:12.190 
so to split that down and make women
kind<00:01:09.860> of<00:01:10.009> take<00:01:10.280> chunks<00:01:11.030> of<00:01:11.180> her<00:01:11.330> to<00:01:11.780> make<00:01:11.930> one

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
kind of take chunks of her to make one

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.250 
kind of take chunks of her to make one
Joan<00:01:12.530> is<00:01:12.830> like<00:01:13.299> it's<00:01:14.299> a<00:01:14.390> blessing<00:01:14.750> I<00:01:14.930> think<00:01:15.200> a

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:15.260 
Joan is like it's a blessing I think a

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.360 
Joan is like it's a blessing I think a
lot<00:01:15.380> of<00:01:15.470> people<00:01:15.740> I<00:01:16.159> think<00:01:16.460> Joan<00:01:16.760> is<00:01:16.970> like<00:01:17.150> it's

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:18.370 
lot of people I think Joan is like it's

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.620 
lot of people I think Joan is like it's
like<00:01:19.370> Cinderella<00:01:19.880> which<00:01:20.000> is<00:01:20.090> actually<00:01:20.420> what
