00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:30.760 
away so this is a very easy designed to

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.479 
away so this is a very easy designed to
do<00:00:31.200> there's<00:00:32.200> a<00:00:32.410> little<00:00:32.619> bit<00:00:32.770> of<00:00:32.829> layering<00:00:33.100> and

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
a little bit of me's upenn put on top

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.690 
a little bit of me's upenn put on top
but<00:00:37.480> very<00:00:38.110> simple<00:00:38.500> to<00:00:38.590> do<00:00:38.739> and<00:00:38.770> it's<00:00:39.100> using<00:00:39.550> a

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:39.700 
but very simple to do and it's using a

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.020 
but very simple to do and it's using a
new<00:00:39.970> plate<00:00:40.300> from<00:00:40.750> my<00:00:41.200> a<00:00:41.440> series<00:00:42.070> which<00:00:42.760> is<00:00:42.910> this

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.030 
new plate from my a series which is this

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.870 
new plate from my a series which is this
one<00:00:43.210> here<00:00:43.450> it's<00:00:43.989> a<00:00:44.170> 05<00:00:44.920> and<00:00:45.250> I'm<00:00:45.430> going<00:00:45.670> to<00:00:45.760> be

one here it's a 05 and I'm going to be
using<00:00:46.030> the<00:00:46.750> design<00:00:47.079> right<00:00:47.350> in<00:00:47.500> the<00:00:47.590> middle

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:47.770 
using the design right in the middle

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.340 
using the design right in the middle
with<00:00:48.670> all<00:00:48.820> the<00:00:48.970> daisies<00:00:49.360> so<00:00:49.870> the<00:00:50.079> first<00:00:50.260> thing

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
top of the yellow and this is going to

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.020 
top of the yellow and this is going to
give<00:01:14.530> us<00:01:14.560> a<00:01:14.709> nice<00:01:14.829> shadow<00:01:15.159> underneath<00:01:15.609> and

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
give us a nice shadow underneath and

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.300 
give us a nice shadow underneath and
give<00:01:16.329> us<00:01:16.450> a<00:01:16.630> little<00:01:16.810> bit<00:01:16.959> more<00:01:17.139> depth<00:01:17.469> we<00:01:18.100> have

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
give us a little bit more depth we have

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.160 
give us a little bit more depth we have
done<00:01:18.490> this<00:01:18.639> technique<00:01:19.060> in<00:01:19.209> the<00:01:19.299> past<00:01:19.539> and<00:01:19.929> I've

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
done this technique in the past and I've

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.830 
done this technique in the past and I've
used<00:01:20.409> a<00:01:20.590> darker<00:01:20.979> color<00:01:21.219> for<00:01:21.520> a<00:01:21.549> shadow<00:01:21.850> but<00:01:22.659> I

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
used a darker color for a shadow but I

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.629 
used a darker color for a shadow but I
really<00:01:23.200> like<00:01:23.380> the<00:01:23.560> way<00:01:23.590> this<00:01:23.859> plays<00:01:24.159> out<00:01:24.369> with

00:01:24.629 --> 00:01:24.639 
really like the way this plays out with

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:26.039 
really like the way this plays out with
all<00:01:24.819> the<00:01:24.939> color<00:01:25.149> combinations<00:01:25.810> we're<00:01:25.929> going

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 
all the color combinations we're going

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:31.679 
all the color combinations we're going
to<00:01:26.109> use<00:01:26.200> today<00:01:29.939> so<00:01:30.939> put<00:01:31.270> this<00:01:31.359> over<00:01:31.569> your

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:31.689 
to use today so put this over your

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:39.380 
to use today so put this over your
design<00:01:33.299> like<00:01:34.299> this

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.300 

make<00:01:40.390> sure<00:01:40.420> you<00:01:40.630> get<00:01:40.720> a<00:01:40.780> good<00:01:40.840> scrape<00:01:44.310> roll

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
make sure you get a good scrape roll

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.030 
make sure you get a good scrape roll
with<00:01:45.580> some<00:01:45.790> pressure<00:01:46.560> like<00:01:47.560> that<00:01:47.830> i<00:01:47.860> always

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
with some pressure like that i always

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.980 
with some pressure like that i always
check<00:01:48.430> my<00:01:48.490> design<00:01:49.000> to<00:01:49.180> see<00:01:49.360> how<00:01:49.480> it<00:01:49.600> comes<00:01:49.720> up

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
check my design to see how it comes up

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.160 
check my design to see how it comes up
and<00:01:50.940> i'm<00:01:51.940> just<00:01:52.150> going<00:01:52.390> to<00:01:52.420> line<00:01:52.630> it<00:01:52.660> up<00:01:52.810> on<00:01:53.020> my

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
and i'm just going to line it up on my

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:59.130 
and i'm just going to line it up on my
nail<00:01:53.380> and<00:01:53.770> go<00:01:54.250> right<00:01:54.430> across<00:01:54.580> like<00:01:55.030> that<00:01:58.140> okay

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
nail and go right across like that okay

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.900 
nail and go right across like that okay
make<00:01:59.770> sure<00:01:59.800> that<00:02:00.220> you're<00:02:00.340> cleaning<00:02:00.640> in

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:00.910 
make sure that you're cleaning in

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:02.910 
make sure that you're cleaning in
between<00:02:01.360> because<00:02:02.080> we're<00:02:02.470> going<00:02:02.590> to<00:02:02.650> switch

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
between because we're going to switch

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.730

doing a shadow technique we're just
going<00:02:15.520> to<00:02:15.580> offset<00:02:16.090> it<00:02:16.120> a<00:02:16.270> little<00:02:16.450> bit<00:02:16.660> so<00:02:16.870> we

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
going to offset it a little bit so we

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:18.949 
going to offset it a little bit so we
can<00:02:17.020> still<00:02:17.470> see<00:02:17.770> a<00:02:17.800> little<00:02:18.010> bit<00:02:18.250> of<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:18.580> white

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
can still see a little bit of the white

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:27.360 
can still see a little bit of the white
behind<00:02:19.959> our<00:02:20.350> design

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.559 

okay<00:02:29.010> you<00:02:30.010> lined<00:02:30.280> it<00:02:30.489> up<00:02:30.580> exactly<00:02:31.299> right<00:02:31.510> it

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
okay you lined it up exactly right it

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.080

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
off behind the black and it gives it a

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.539 
off behind the black and it gives it a
little<00:02:50.019> bit<00:02:50.230> of<00:02:50.349> depth<00:02:50.560> and<00:02:50.739> a<00:02:51.159> little<00:02:51.430> bit
