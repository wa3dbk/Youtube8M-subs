 recognize that it is the command of the Lord who writes to you 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.120
 and he says so 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.600
 in the chapter in which he teaches how to worship 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.170

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:03.470
 began to speak in opinions were baptized in the holy spirit and begin 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.430
 prophesy that you do not need their 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.379
 only one point in our midst is with us here 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:13.640

 we need to understand that when the glory of God comes upon a man who 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.479
 can not stand to stand 

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:50.779
 the day that God shed his lordship over the man as he has already shed upon 

00:02:50.779 --> 00:02:54.189
 He does not have to forgive me, I'm talking there. 

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:58.389
 I'm talking about people feeling the pain is 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:02:59.599
