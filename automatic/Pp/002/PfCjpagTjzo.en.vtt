cutting capacity I'm used to something a
little<00:02:12.569> bit<00:02:12.690> bigger<00:02:12.840> than<00:02:13.020> that<00:02:13.790> perhaps<00:02:14.790> with

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
little bit bigger than that perhaps with

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.510 
little bit bigger than that perhaps with
the<00:02:15.750> you<00:02:16.110> know<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:16.560> limited<00:02:16.980> power<00:02:17.190> output

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
the you know the limited power output

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.070 
the you know the limited power output
you<00:02:17.580> can<00:02:17.700> get<00:02:17.790> from<00:02:17.940> a<00:02:18.000> battery<00:02:18.360> they<00:02:18.810> couldn't

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
you can get from a battery they couldn't

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.949 
you can get from a battery they couldn't
extend<00:02:19.410> it<00:02:19.590> much<00:02:19.800> further<00:02:20.010> I'm<00:02:20.220> not<00:02:20.370> sure<00:02:20.959> so

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
extend it much further I'm not sure so

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.809 
extend it much further I'm not sure so
it<00:02:22.140> just<00:02:22.290> doesn't<00:02:22.440> cut<00:02:22.680> quite<00:02:22.980> as<00:02:23.160> far<00:02:23.430> as<00:02:23.700> I'm

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
it just doesn't cut quite as far as I'm

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.199

kind<00:02:24.030> of<00:02:24.120> used<00:02:24.330> to<00:02:24.420> but<00:02:25.379> having<00:02:25.800> said<00:02:25.980> that<00:02:26.209> it

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
kind of used to but having said that it

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.600 
kind of used to but having said that it
what<00:02:28.140> you're<00:02:28.290> touching<00:02:28.470> its<00:02:28.860> cutting<00:02:29.220> well

your own Amin to Burmese only designed

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.130 
your own Amin to Burmese only designed
for<00:02:57.730> small<00:02:58.120> blocks<00:02:58.390> again<00:02:58.750> that<00:02:58.959> sort<00:02:59.050> of

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
for small blocks again that sort of

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.990 
for small blocks again that sort of
thing<00:02:59.319> movin<00:02:59.470> your<00:02:59.680> top<00:02:59.890> files<00:03:00.250> no<00:03:00.760> that's

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
thing movin your top files no that's

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.190 
thing movin your top files no that's
right<00:03:01.090> so<00:03:01.239> I<00:03:01.270> did<00:03:01.360> my<00:03:01.569> whole<00:03:01.780> my<00:03:02.170> whole

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
right so I did my whole my whole

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.650 
right so I did my whole my whole
probably<00:03:02.680> very<00:03:03.040> very<00:03:03.640> easily<00:03:03.850> still<00:03:04.540> had

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
probably very very easily still had

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.850 
probably very very easily still had
better<00:03:04.840> despair<00:03:06.209> but<00:03:07.209> on<00:03:08.170> the<00:03:08.350> next<00:03:08.500> one<00:03:08.709> I

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
better despair but on the next one I

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.259 
better despair but on the next one I
reckon<00:03:09.100> they<00:03:09.220> should<00:03:09.459> put<00:03:09.580> a<00:03:09.610> shoulder<00:03:10.000> strap

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
reckon they should put a shoulder strap

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.930 
reckon they should put a shoulder strap
on<00:03:10.890> just<00:03:11.890> stick<00:03:12.099> your<00:03:12.220> own<00:03:12.340> it<00:03:12.430> on<00:03:12.519> I<00:03:12.550> reckon

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
on just stick your own it on I reckon

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.680 
on just stick your own it on I reckon
yeah<00:03:13.209> your<00:03:13.450> own<00:03:13.540> for<00:03:13.840> it<00:03:13.900> could<00:03:14.410> be<00:03:14.530> fine<00:03:15.690> what

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
yeah your own for it could be fine what

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.050 
yeah your own for it could be fine what
else<00:03:16.720> to<00:03:16.989> say

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
else to say

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.550

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
bit with if you don't get kind of square

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.600 
bit with if you don't get kind of square
like<00:04:52.810> that<00:04:52.840> star<00:04:53.650> already<00:04:54.070> there

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
like that star already there

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.490 
like that star already there
probably<00:04:55.120> just<00:04:55.240> just<00:04:55.900> think<00:04:56.110> we<00:04:56.259> thought<00:04:56.409> the

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
probably just just think we thought the

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.110 
probably just just think we thought the
manufacturer<00:04:57.069> recommends<00:04:57.550> yeah<00:04:57.759> because<00:04:58.000> it

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
manufacturer recommends yeah because it

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.399 
manufacturer recommends yeah because it
does<00:04:58.270> a<00:04:58.300> great<00:04:58.509> job<00:04:58.599> and<00:04:59.020> you<00:04:59.080> know<00:04:59.199> it's<00:04:59.319> not

00:04:59.399 --> 00:04:59.409 
does a great job and you know it's not

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:01.230 
does a great job and you know it's not
gonna<00:04:59.530> muck<00:04:59.770> up<00:04:59.949> you<00:05:00.129> so<00:05:00.550> with<00:05:00.699> anything<00:05:01.090> you'd

gonna muck up you so with anything you'd

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.270 
gonna muck up you so with anything you'd

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
normally try and go bigger more wineries

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.879 
normally try and go bigger more wineries
Biggers<00:05:03.879> better<00:05:03.909> yeah<00:05:04.569> maybe<00:05:05.020> in<00:05:05.229> this<00:05:05.349> case

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:05.889 
Biggers better yeah maybe in this case

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:08.339 
Biggers better yeah maybe in this case
don't<00:05:06.400> go<00:05:06.550> bigger<00:05:06.819> would<00:05:07.569> be<00:05:07.689> better<00:05:07.930> that's

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:08.349 
don't go bigger would be better that's

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:11.279 
don't go bigger would be better that's
right<00:05:08.560> I<00:05:09.150> think<00:05:10.150> that's<00:05:10.419> pretty<00:05:10.629> much<00:05:10.750> it<00:05:11.050> well

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:11.289 
right I think that's pretty much it well

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:12.809 
right I think that's pretty much it well
