the wall oh this we call that the vision
strip<00:00:19.550> we<00:00:20.550> got<00:00:20.700> this<00:00:20.790> crazy<00:00:21.090> idea<00:00:21.210> that

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
strip we got this crazy idea that

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.889 
strip we got this crazy idea that
somehow<00:00:22.759> recess<00:00:23.759> was<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.000> waste<00:00:24.239> of<00:00:24.419> time<00:00:24.630> and

00:00:24.889 --> 00:00:24.899

somehow recess was a waste of time and
so<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.800> huge<00:00:26.520> proportion<00:00:27.360> of<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.989> schools<00:00:28.259> of

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
so a huge proportion of the schools of

so a huge proportion of the schools of
school<00:00:28.770> districts<00:00:29.220> started<00:00:29.730> canceling<00:00:30.300> or

learn<00:01:49.890> better<00:01:50.100> outside<00:01:50.789> there<00:01:51.600> are<00:01:51.719> lots<00:01:51.990> of

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
learn better outside there are lots of

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.440 
learn better outside there are lots of
studies<00:01:52.350> showing<00:01:52.740> up<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.189> really<00:01:54.000> indicate

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
studies showing up to really indicate

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.480 
studies showing up to really indicate
that<00:01:54.630> if<00:01:54.780> we<00:01:54.930> really<00:01:55.140> want<00:01:55.259> our<00:01:55.680> kids<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.369> do

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
that if we really want our kids to do

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.039 
that if we really want our kids to do
well<00:01:56.670> on<00:01:56.880> tests<00:01:57.359> we'll<00:01:57.659> get<00:01:57.780> them<00:01:57.899> outdoors

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
well on tests we'll get them outdoors

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.200 
well on tests we'll get them outdoors
I'm<00:01:58.469> thinking<00:01:58.740> about<00:01:58.890> writing<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.340> column

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
I'm thinking about writing a column

I'm thinking about writing a column
someday<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:01.079> want<00:02:01.289> your<00:02:01.439> kids<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.740> get<00:02:01.950> into

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
someday that want your kids to get into

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.819 
someday that want your kids to get into

I'm not talking about necessarily
learning<00:02:10.410> about<00:02:10.649> nature<00:02:11.009> necessarily<00:02:11.940> that's

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
learning about nature necessarily that's

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.580 
learning about nature necessarily that's
part<00:02:12.510> of<00:02:12.570> it<00:02:12.720> but<00:02:13.290> just<00:02:13.560> learning<00:02:14.100> in<00:02:14.250> nature

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
part of it but just learning in nature

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.170 
part of it but just learning in nature

when people think about nature they

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.610 
when people think about nature they
think<00:02:17.390> of<00:02:17.480> it<00:02:17.570> as<00:02:17.660> something<00:02:18.020> separate<00:02:18.410> from

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
think of it as something separate from

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.020 
think of it as something separate from
