00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.550 
the drop down menus the choices that it
gives<00:01:49.430> me<00:01:49.670> with<00:01:49.880> Photoshop<00:01:50.329> are<00:01:50.540> TIFF<00:01:50.810> or<00:01:51.049> PSD

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
gives me with Photoshop are TIFF or PSD

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.609 
gives me with Photoshop are TIFF or PSD
and<00:01:52.070> I<00:01:52.939> use<00:01:53.270> the<00:01:53.420> PSD<00:01:53.810> because<00:01:54.110> it<00:01:54.259> gives<00:01:54.439> me

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
and I use the PSD because it gives me

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:56.920 
and I use the PSD because it gives me
ability<00:01:55.310> to<00:01:55.430> use<00:01:55.549> layers<00:01:55.820> but<00:01:56.420> a<00:01:56.630> slightly

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
ability to use layers but a slightly

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.330 
ability to use layers but a slightly
smaller<00:01:57.290> file<00:01:57.680> ok

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
smaller file ok

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.880

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
the article they're in descending order

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.539 
the article they're in descending order
of<00:02:32.630> size<00:02:32.989> so<00:02:33.349> the<00:02:33.500> largest<00:02:33.829> with<00:02:34.160> the<00:02:34.310> most

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:34.549 
of size so the largest with the most

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:37.839 
of size so the largest with the most
colors<00:02:34.970> is<00:02:35.209> Profoto<00:02:35.780> down<00:02:36.680> to<00:02:36.860> srgb<00:02:37.489> which<00:02:37.700> is

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:37.849 
colors is Profoto down to srgb which is

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:40.300 
colors is Profoto down to srgb which is
the<00:02:38.000> smallest<00:02:38.420> color<00:02:38.870> space<00:02:39.230> the<00:02:39.920> best<00:02:40.160> way

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
the smallest color space the best way

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.130 
the smallest color space the best way
that<00:02:40.459> I<00:02:40.489> can<00:02:40.700> describe<00:02:40.880> that<00:02:41.450> is<00:02:41.630> imagine<00:02:42.110> that

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
that I can describe that is imagine that

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.650 
that I can describe that is imagine that
you<00:02:42.290> have<00:02:42.500> a<00:02:42.530> glass<00:02:42.860> of<00:02:43.040> water<00:02:43.310> the<00:02:44.090> Profoto

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
you have a glass of water the Profoto

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.559 
you have a glass of water the Profoto
glass<00:02:45.110> is<00:02:45.410> bigger<00:02:45.650> than<00:02:46.069> the<00:02:46.250> srgb<00:02:46.910> glass<00:02:47.120> okay

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
glass is bigger than the srgb glass okay

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.960 
glass is bigger than the srgb glass okay
so<00:02:47.630> it<00:02:47.810> just<00:02:47.989> contains<00:02:48.440> more<00:02:49.280> information

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
so it just contains more information

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.750 
so it just contains more information
right<00:02:50.540> so<00:02:51.349> I<00:02:51.560> always<00:02:51.709> choose<00:02:52.099> the<00:02:52.370> largest

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
right so I always choose the largest

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.059 
right so I always choose the largest
option<00:02:53.720> that's<00:02:54.260> going<00:02:54.560> to<00:02:54.680> give<00:02:54.860> me<00:02:54.980> the

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
option that's going to give me the

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:57.610 
option that's going to give me the
highest<00:02:55.400> quality<00:02:55.819> and<00:02:56.090> the<00:02:56.569> same<00:02:56.780> with<00:02:57.049> bit

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
highest quality and the same with bit

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.819 
highest quality and the same with bit
depth<00:02:57.890> you<00:02:58.040> can<00:02:58.220> see<00:02:58.400> that<00:02:58.549> that's<00:02:58.670> 16<00:02:59.299> and

00:02:59.819 --> 00:02:59.829 
depth you can see that that's 16 and

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:06.220 
depth you can see that that's 16 and
8-bit<00:03:01.450> so<00:03:02.450> I<00:03:02.480> choose<00:03:02.810> the<00:03:03.049> 16<00:03:04.150> resolution<00:03:05.230> you

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
8-bit so I choose the 16 resolution you

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.020 
8-bit so I choose the 16 resolution you
can<00:03:06.260> put<00:03:06.920> pretty<00:03:07.100> much<00:03:07.220> anything<00:03:07.519> you<00:03:07.609> want<00:03:07.700> in

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
can put pretty much anything you want in

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.360 
can put pretty much anything you want in
here<00:03:08.299> I<00:03:08.420> choose<00:03:08.720> 300<00:03:09.350> because<00:03:09.500> that's<00:03:09.889> what<00:03:10.160> my

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
here I choose 300 because that's what my

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.819 
here I choose 300 because that's what my
lab<00:03:11.120> prints<00:03:11.540> that<00:03:11.690> that's<00:03:12.079> what<00:03:12.260> I<00:03:12.290> send<00:03:12.620> to<00:03:12.799> my

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
lab prints that that's what I send to my

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:14.680 
lab prints that that's what I send to my
printer<00:03:13.370> if<00:03:13.489> I'm<00:03:13.639> going<00:03:13.850> to<00:03:13.940> print<00:03:14.180> something
