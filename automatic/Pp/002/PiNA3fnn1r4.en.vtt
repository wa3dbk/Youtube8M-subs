00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
kind of funny much it's math so what I

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.139 
kind of funny much it's math so what I
mean<00:00:46.920> is<00:00:47.070> that<00:00:47.190> you<00:00:47.309> watch<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.730> snow<00:00:47.940> and

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
mean is that you watch the snow and

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.850 
mean is that you watch the snow and
basically<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:48.780> laugh<00:00:48.960> at<00:00:49.170> everything<00:00:49.379> well

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
basically you laugh at everything well

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.260 
basically you laugh at everything well
kind<00:00:50.129> of<00:00:50.190> feeling<00:00:50.460> embarrassed<00:00:50.850> for<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.090> main

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
kind of feeling embarrassed for the main

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.939 
kind of feeling embarrassed for the main
character<00:00:51.660> at<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.780> same<00:00:51.960> time<00:00:52.199> I<00:00:52.440> personally

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
character at the same time I personally

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.170 
character at the same time I personally
think<00:00:53.100> this<00:00:53.250> kind<00:00:53.489> of<00:00:53.550> main<00:00:53.699> characters<00:00:54.149> the

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
think this kind of main characters the

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.029 
think this kind of main characters the
hardest<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.660> pull<00:00:54.840> off<00:00:55.020> but<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:55.500> think<00:00:55.590> this

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
hardest to pull off but I think this

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.470 
hardest to pull off but I think this
series<00:00:56.280> pulls<00:00:56.670> off<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.940> main<00:00:57.090> character

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
series pulls off the main character

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.939 
series pulls off the main character
perfectly<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:58.199> I<00:00:58.260> think<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.530> helps<00:00:58.739> if<00:00:58.859> they

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
perfectly and I think it helps if they

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.010 
perfectly and I think it helps if they
establish<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.430> great<00:00:59.699> background<00:00:59.940> for<00:01:00.270> him<00:01:00.539> so

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
establish a great background for him so

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.090 
establish a great background for him so
you<00:01:01.109> know<00:01:01.230> more<00:01:01.410> about<00:01:01.559> where<00:01:01.739> he's<00:01:01.859> coming

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
you know more about where he's coming

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.560 
you know more about where he's coming
from<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.579> don't<00:01:02.850> think<00:01:03.000> I've<00:01:03.090> ever<00:01:03.120> enjoyed

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
from I don't think I've ever enjoyed

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.740 
from I don't think I've ever enjoyed
flashbacks<00:01:04.229> this<00:01:04.409> much<00:01:05.180> and<00:01:06.180> also<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:06.630> know

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
flashbacks this much and also you know

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.300 
flashbacks this much and also you know
he's<00:01:06.869> not<00:01:07.020> exactly<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.590> best<00:01:07.830> human<00:01:08.280> being

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
he's not exactly the best human being

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.070 
he's not exactly the best human being
but<00:01:08.909> for<00:01:09.060> some<00:01:09.210> reason<00:01:09.479> you're<00:01:09.600> still<00:01:09.750> rooting

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
but for some reason you're still rooting

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.550 
but for some reason you're still rooting
for<00:01:10.229> him

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
for him

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.080 
for him
so<00:01:10.710> naturally<00:01:11.189> because<00:01:11.430> of<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.640> title<00:01:11.939> this

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
so naturally because of the title this

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.820 
so naturally because of the title this
story<00:01:12.360> is<00:01:12.479> about<00:01:12.540> two<00:01:12.720> brothers<00:01:13.229> who<00:01:13.619> both

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
story is about two brothers who both

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.800 
story is about two brothers who both
dream<00:01:14.100> of<00:01:14.220> becoming<00:01:14.460> astronaut<00:01:15.030> someday<00:01:15.270> what

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
dream of becoming astronaut someday what

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.270 
dream of becoming astronaut someday what
is<00:01:15.930> kind<00:01:16.170> of<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.259> protective<00:01:16.799> embarrassing

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
is kind of the protective embarrassing

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.770 
is kind of the protective embarrassing
older<00:01:17.520> brother<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.150> other<00:01:18.299> ones<00:01:18.509> kind<00:01:18.689> of

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
older brother and the other ones kind of

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.060 
older brother and the other ones kind of
really<00:01:18.990> laid-back<00:01:19.200> but<00:01:19.590> it's<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.799> one<00:01:19.950> who

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
really laid-back but it's the one who

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.370 
really laid-back but it's the one who
actually<00:01:20.430> achieved<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.850> goal<00:01:21.060> first<00:01:21.479> oh<00:01:21.960> good

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
actually achieved the goal first oh good

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.609 
actually achieved the goal first oh good
because<00:01:23.070> that's<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.430> little<00:01:23.520> not<00:01:24.320> good<00:01:25.320> idea

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
because that's a little not good idea

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.510 
because that's a little not good idea
chief<00:01:25.920> question<00:01:26.640> is<00:01:26.850> that's<00:01:27.060> not<00:01:27.299> good

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
chief question is that's not good

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:39.440 
chief question is that's not good
you<00:01:29.060> know<00:01:29.210> Alice<00:01:29.509> she's<00:01:29.780> a<00:01:29.810> hoot<00:01:30.110> on

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.150 

and<00:01:40.450> so<00:01:41.020> really<00:01:41.200> it<00:01:41.410> just<00:01:41.590> kind<00:01:41.770> of<00:01:41.830> becomes<00:01:42.040> a

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.160 
and so really it just kind of becomes a

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.230
