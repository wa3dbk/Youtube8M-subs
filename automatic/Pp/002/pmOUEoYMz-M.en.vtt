00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
college and I love the psychology of

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.240 
college and I love the psychology of
color<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:33.930> I<00:00:34.320> think<00:00:34.710> it's<00:00:34.800> just<00:00:34.920> so

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
color and I think it's just so

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.150 
color and I think it's just so
interesting<00:00:36.120> how<00:00:36.270> you<00:00:36.329> can<00:00:36.510> kind<00:00:36.750> of<00:00:37.160> pair

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
interesting how you can kind of pair

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.799 
interesting how you can kind of pair
colors<00:00:38.579> together<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.969> create<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.450> different

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
colors together to create a different

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.660 
colors together to create a different
kind<00:00:39.840> of<00:00:40.079> mood<00:00:40.350> or<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:40.980> create<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.309> different

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
kind of mood or to create a different

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.420 
kind of mood or to create a different
look<00:00:41.820> so<00:00:42.360> emerald<00:00:43.200> is<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.590> Pantone<00:00:44.040> color<00:00:44.340> of

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
look so emerald is the Pantone color of

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.180 
look so emerald is the Pantone color of
the<00:00:44.489> year<00:00:44.700> for<00:00:44.910> 2013<00:00:45.660> I'm<00:00:46.530> sporting<00:00:47.039> my

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
emerald and emerald this kind of color

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.779 
emerald and emerald this kind of color
of<00:00:51.989> green<00:00:52.320> kind<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:52.770> this<00:00:52.860> mid-range<00:00:53.399> to

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
of green kind of this mid-range to

of green kind of this mid-range to
darker<00:00:54.239> color<00:00:54.480> of<00:00:54.600> green<00:00:54.809> can<00:00:55.620> really<00:00:56.010> evoke

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
different message so when I think of

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.799 
different message so when I think of
emerald<00:01:02.699> I<00:01:02.760> often<00:01:03.030> easily<00:01:03.180> think<00:01:03.570> of<00:01:03.660> an

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
emerald I often easily think of an

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.340 
emerald I often easily think of an
emerald<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.350> precious<00:01:04.710> stone<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.250> also<00:01:06.350> very

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
emerald the precious stone and also very

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.140 
emerald the precious stone and also very
sophisticated<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.760> elegant<00:01:09.710> expensive

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
sophisticated and elegant expensive

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.580 
sophisticated and elegant expensive
that's<00:01:12.150> kind<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.390> what<00:01:12.540> I<00:01:12.570> think<00:01:12.869> about<00:01:12.990> but

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
that's kind of what I think about but

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.999 
that's kind of what I think about but
also<00:01:13.830> you<00:01:14.189> really<00:01:14.490> could<00:01:14.729> think<00:01:15.119> about<00:01:16.009> the

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
also you really could think about the

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.130 
also you really could think about the
heritage<00:01:17.549> of<00:01:17.869> this<00:01:18.869> color<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.700> the

heritage of this color and the

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.630 
heritage of this color and the
traditional<00:01:22.140> kind<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.590> aspect<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:23.189> it<00:01:23.340> you've

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
traditional kind of aspect of it you've

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.480 
traditional kind of aspect of it you've
seen<00:01:24.049> this<00:01:25.049> kind<00:01:25.290> of<00:01:25.380> darker<00:01:25.920> green<00:01:26.729> paired<00:01:27.450> up

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
seen this kind of darker green paired up

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.990 
seen this kind of darker green paired up
maybe<00:01:29.490> in<00:01:29.579> some<00:01:29.790> traditional<00:01:30.390> home<00:01:30.689> decor<00:01:31.110> it

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
maybe in some traditional home decor it

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.690 
maybe in some traditional home decor it
can<00:01:33.000> be<00:01:33.119> very<00:01:33.299> rustic<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:33.990> woodsy<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.700> very

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.630 
can be very rustic and woodsy and very
homey<00:01:36.320> so<00:01:37.320> that's<00:01:37.500> another<00:01:37.710> thing<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.100> also

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
homey so that's another thing and also

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.190 
homey so that's another thing and also
this<00:01:38.909> kind<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.210> mid-range<00:01:39.390> green<00:01:39.810> is<00:01:39.960> great

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
this kind of mid-range green is great

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.340 
this kind of mid-range green is great
for<00:01:40.460> being<00:01:41.460> energetic<00:01:42.270> know<00:01:42.689> it's<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.869> color<00:01:43.170> we

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
for being energetic know it's a color we

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.030 
for being energetic know it's a color we
find<00:01:43.740> in<00:01:43.979> nature<00:01:44.540> it's<00:01:45.540> very<00:01:45.630> lively<00:01:46.170> and

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
find in nature it's very lively and

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.330 
find in nature it's very lively and
organic<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.119> so<00:01:48.720> that's<00:01:49.200> also<00:01:49.439> something

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
organic and so that's also something

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.160 
organic and so that's also something
that<00:01:50.640> we<00:01:50.759> can<00:01:50.939> get<00:01:51.090> from<00:01:51.360> kind<00:01:51.780> of<00:01:51.840> this<00:01:51.899> color

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
that we can get from kind of this color

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.560 
that we can get from kind of this color
just<00:01:52.409> based<00:01:52.710> on<00:01:52.890> how<00:01:53.100> we<00:01:53.430> use<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.939> so<00:01:54.149> I'm<00:01:54.479> going

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
just based on how we use it so I'm going

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.620 
just based on how we use it so I'm going
to<00:01:54.689> talk<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:54.840> little<00:01:55.079> bit<00:01:55.320> about<00:01:55.439> um<00:01:56.570> kind<00:01:57.570> of

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.539 
to talk a little bit about um kind of
color<00:01:58.020> theory<00:01:58.560> of<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.920> fun<00:01:59.100> do<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.340> know<00:01:59.430> in

um<00:02:04.230> emerald<00:02:04.950> is<00:02:05.040> gonna<00:02:05.220> be<00:02:05.400> over<00:02:05.610> here<00:02:05.640> kind<00:02:06.000> of

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.120 
um emerald is gonna be over here kind of

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.260 
um emerald is gonna be over here kind of
in<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.390> green<00:02:06.600> range<00:02:07.340> the<00:02:08.340> first<00:02:08.670> kind<00:02:09.119> of

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
in the green range the first kind of

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.340 
in the green range the first kind of
color<00:02:09.450> combination<00:02:09.899> I'm<00:02:09.990> gonna<00:02:10.110> talk<00:02:10.229> about

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
color combination I'm gonna talk about

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.730 
color combination I'm gonna talk about
is<00:02:10.590> monochromatic<00:02:11.310> so<00:02:12.210> basically<00:02:12.660> you<00:02:13.560> have

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
is monochromatic so basically you have

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.410 
is monochromatic so basically you have
this<00:02:13.950> green<00:02:14.250> range<00:02:14.580> and<00:02:14.880> it's<00:02:15.060> gonna<00:02:15.180> be

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
this green range and it's gonna be

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.070 
this green range and it's gonna be
anything<00:02:15.930> within<00:02:16.140> this<00:02:16.650> range<00:02:17.040> so<00:02:17.810> the<00:02:18.810> light

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
anything within this range so the light

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:25.070 
anything within this range so the light
and<00:02:19.440> dark<00:02:19.770> tint<00:02:20.430> or<00:02:20.670> shade<00:02:20.970> of<00:02:21.830> this<00:02:22.830> color<00:02:24.080> for

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
and dark tint or shade of this color for

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.070 
and dark tint or shade of this color for
example<00:02:26.270> here<00:02:27.270> to<00:02:27.450> be<00:02:27.570> a<00:02:27.600> monochromatic

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
example here to be a monochromatic

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.930 
example here to be a monochromatic
looking<00:02:28.650> this<00:02:28.770> is<00:02:28.890> blue<00:02:29.160> this<00:02:29.310> is<00:02:29.490> not<00:02:29.670> green

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
looking this is blue this is not green

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.050 
looking this is blue this is not green
but<00:02:30.750> it's<00:02:31.320> kind<00:02:31.740> of<00:02:31.800> the<00:02:31.920> same<00:02:32.190> idea<00:02:32.220> it's<00:02:32.940> all

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
but it's kind of the same idea it's all

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.780 
but it's kind of the same idea it's all
within<00:02:33.240> the<00:02:33.420> same<00:02:33.800> family<00:02:34.800> the<00:02:35.190> same<00:02:35.220> color

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
within the same family the same color

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.390 
within the same family the same color
just<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.300> light<00:02:36.540> and<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:36.930> dark<00:02:37.280> you<00:02:38.280> know

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
just the light and the dark you know

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.699 
just the light and the dark you know
obviously<00:02:38.730> that<00:02:38.880> it's<00:02:39.120> gonna<00:02:39.270> match<00:02:39.540> it's<00:02:40.380> not

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
obviously that it's gonna match it's not

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.440 
obviously that it's gonna match it's not
very<00:02:42.830> hard<00:02:43.830> for<00:02:44.100> the<00:02:44.250> eyes<00:02:44.370> to<00:02:44.670> look<00:02:44.700> at<00:02:45.060> so<00:02:45.330> it

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
very hard for the eyes to look at so it

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.240 
very hard for the eyes to look at so it
can<00:02:45.660> be<00:02:45.840> you<00:02:46.140> know<00:02:46.170> very<00:02:46.470> calming<00:02:47.070> and

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
can be you know very calming and

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.560 
can be you know very calming and
soothing<00:02:47.370> even<00:02:47.760> if<00:02:47.850> you're<00:02:47.970> using<00:02:48.150> your<00:02:48.420> red

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
soothing even if you're using your red

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
soothing even if you're using your red
or<00:02:48.690> an<00:02:48.810> orange<00:02:49.170> and<00:02:49.640> you<00:02:50.640> know<00:02:51.080> it's<00:02:52.080> cool

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
or an orange and you know it's cool

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.070 
or an orange and you know it's cool
these<00:02:52.950> days<00:02:53.250> it's<00:02:53.580> very<00:02:53.640> um<00:02:54.150> Bray<00:02:54.570> you<00:02:54.840> know<00:02:54.930> we

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
these days it's very um Bray you know we

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.720 
these days it's very um Bray you know we
have<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:55.320> hombre<00:02:55.590> trend<00:02:56.220> which<00:02:56.430> is<00:02:56.520> really

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
have the hombre trend which is really

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.340 
have the hombre trend which is really
big<00:02:56.880> right<00:02:57.060> now<00:02:57.120> and<00:02:57.540> that<00:02:58.050> would<00:02:58.200> be<00:02:58.320> a

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
big right now and that would be a

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.830 
big right now and that would be a
monochromatic<00:02:58.890> color<00:02:59.520> screen<00:02:59.940> so<00:03:00.450> that's<00:03:00.630> how

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
monochromatic color screen so that's how

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.260 
monochromatic color screen so that's how
emeralds<00:03:01.620> can<00:03:01.770> be<00:03:01.860> used<00:03:02.190> you<00:03:02.730> can<00:03:02.910> pair<00:03:03.240> a

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
emeralds can be used you can pair a

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.000 
emeralds can be used you can pair a
darker<00:03:03.780> and<00:03:03.810> rolled<00:03:04.350> green<00:03:04.620> with<00:03:04.830> like<00:03:04.980> a

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
darker and rolled green with like a

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.630 
darker and rolled green with like a
lighter<00:03:05.340> mint<00:03:06.050> green<00:03:07.050> color<00:03:07.290> and<00:03:07.739> that<00:03:08.489> would

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
lighter mint green color and that would

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.090 
lighter mint green color and that would
be<00:03:08.790> a<00:03:08.820> really<00:03:09.060> fun<00:03:09.390> and<00:03:10.050> kind<00:03:10.200> of<00:03:10.380> trendy<00:03:10.860> way

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
be a really fun and kind of trendy way

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.949 
be a really fun and kind of trendy way
to<00:03:11.160> use<00:03:11.430> those<00:03:11.640> two<00:03:11.820> colors<00:03:12.030> here's<00:03:12.870> a

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
to use those two colors here's a

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.890 
to use those two colors here's a
monochromatic<00:03:13.590> color<00:03:14.130> scheme<00:03:14.600> Mike<00:03:15.600> would<00:03:15.780> be

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
monochromatic color scheme Mike would be

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.340 
monochromatic color scheme Mike would be
found<00:03:16.110> in<00:03:16.290> nature<00:03:16.730> my<00:03:17.840> this<00:03:18.840> is<00:03:19.050> kind<00:03:19.260> of

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
found in nature my this is kind of

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.410 
found in nature my this is kind of
yellow-green<00:03:19.950> but<00:03:20.310> you<00:03:20.550> know<00:03:20.700> just<00:03:21.120> work<00:03:21.269> with

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
yellow-green but you know just work with

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.000 
yellow-green but you know just work with
me<00:03:21.450> a<00:03:21.600> little<00:03:21.840> bit<00:03:21.930> of<00:03:22.350> a<00:03:22.470> parent<00:03:22.830> and<00:03:22.950> an

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
me a little bit of a parent and an

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.560 
me a little bit of a parent and an
avocado<00:03:23.100> so<00:03:23.670> this<00:03:23.820> would<00:03:23.970> be<00:03:24.090> monochromatic

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
avocado so this would be monochromatic

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.290 
avocado so this would be monochromatic
next<00:03:25.500> after<00:03:25.709> monochromatic<00:03:26.130> is<00:03:26.790> going<00:03:27.150> to<00:03:27.239> be

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
next after monochromatic is going to be

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.500 
next after monochromatic is going to be
a<00:03:27.330> complementary<00:03:27.959> so<00:03:28.820> altogether<00:03:29.820> now<00:03:30.120> what's

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
a complementary so altogether now what's

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.500 
a complementary so altogether now what's
the<00:03:30.630> complementary<00:03:31.140> color<00:03:31.200> of<00:03:31.590> green<00:03:31.880> red<00:03:32.880> so

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
the complementary color of green red so

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.660 
the complementary color of green red so
the<00:03:34.200> complementary<00:03:34.650> color<00:03:34.769> is<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.430> color

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
the complementary color is the color

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.000 
the complementary color is the color
that<00:03:35.790> is<00:03:36.120> directly<00:03:36.870> across<00:03:37.260> the<00:03:37.350> color<00:03:37.739> wheel

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
that is directly across the color wheel

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.680 
that is directly across the color wheel
from<00:03:38.760> with<00:03:39.120> the<00:03:39.269> emerald<00:03:39.840> or<00:03:40.110> green<00:03:40.560> is<00:03:41.690> red

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
from with the emerald or green is red

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.110 
from with the emerald or green is red
now<00:03:43.400> it<00:03:44.400> doesn't<00:03:44.580> mean<00:03:44.760> that<00:03:44.820> you<00:03:44.940> have<00:03:45.030> to

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
now it doesn't mean that you have to

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
now it doesn't mean that you have to
walk<00:03:45.209> around<00:03:45.480> looking<00:03:45.630> like<00:03:45.690> a<00:03:45.780> Christmas

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
walk around looking like a Christmas

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.310 
walk around looking like a Christmas

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.260 
it's like a lighter color and this green
has<00:04:01.440> a<00:04:01.470> little<00:04:01.740> bit<00:04:01.800> more<00:04:01.860> yellow<00:04:02.250> in<00:04:02.400> it<00:04:02.670> but

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
has a little bit more yellow in it but

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.140 
has a little bit more yellow in it but
this<00:04:03.830> generally<00:04:04.830> speaking<00:04:05.100> is<00:04:05.400> a<00:04:05.430> you<00:04:06.090> know

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
this generally speaking is a you know

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.360 
this generally speaking is a you know
complimentary<00:04:06.750> color<00:04:07.020> it<00:04:07.740> doesn't<00:04:07.890> have<00:04:08.130> to

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
complimentary color it doesn't have to

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.990 
complimentary color it doesn't have to
be<00:04:09.590> bright<00:04:10.590> green<00:04:10.620> and<00:04:11.040> bright<00:04:11.220> red<00:04:11.280> in<00:04:11.730> order

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
be bright green and bright red in order

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.370 
be bright green and bright red in order
for<00:04:12.150> it<00:04:12.240> to<00:04:12.270> be<00:04:12.420> a<00:04:12.450> complement<00:04:12.870> color<00:04:13.020> you<00:04:13.200> can

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
for it to be a complement color you can

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.530 
for it to be a complement color you can
use<00:04:13.410> the<00:04:14.220> different<00:04:14.610> ranges<00:04:15.030> within<00:04:15.360> that

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
use the different ranges within that

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.120 
use the different ranges within that
color<00:04:15.870> so<00:04:16.170> that's<00:04:16.290> my<00:04:16.470> pink<00:04:16.680> and<00:04:16.739> green<00:04:16.920> look

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
color so that's my pink and green look

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.220 
color so that's my pink and green look
really<00:04:17.370> great<00:04:17.549> together<00:04:17.700> is<00:04:18.060> because<00:04:18.209> pink<00:04:18.660> is

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.230 
really great together is because pink is

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.350 
really great together is because pink is
a<00:04:19.290> tint<00:04:19.650> of<00:04:19.739> red<00:04:20.160> the<00:04:20.910> thing<00:04:21.060> that's<00:04:21.239> cool

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:21.360 
a tint of red the thing that's cool

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.880 
a tint of red the thing that's cool
about<00:04:21.420> complementary<00:04:22.049> colors<00:04:22.320> is<00:04:22.470> that<00:04:22.500> green

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
about complementary colors is that green

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.550 
about complementary colors is that green
never<00:04:23.130> looks<00:04:23.400> so<00:04:23.910> green<00:04:24.330> and<00:04:24.660> so<00:04:24.810> vibrant<00:04:25.380> as

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
never looks so green and so vibrant as

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.010 
never looks so green and so vibrant as
one<00:04:26.010> that's<00:04:26.160> sitting<00:04:26.520> next<00:04:26.670> to<00:04:26.850> red<00:04:27.180> which<00:04:27.870> is

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
one that's sitting next to red which is

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.080 
one that's sitting next to red which is
why<00:04:28.290> they<00:04:28.620> work<00:04:29.070> so<00:04:29.280> well<00:04:29.310> together<00:04:29.580> red

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
why they work so well together red

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.850 
why they work so well together red
doesn't<00:04:30.690> ever<00:04:30.990> look<00:04:31.260> so<00:04:31.530> red<00:04:32.070> and<00:04:32.340> vibrant<00:04:33.300> and

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
doesn't ever look so red and vibrant and

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.220 
doesn't ever look so red and vibrant and
you<00:04:34.860> know<00:04:34.950> it's<00:04:35.130> kind<00:04:35.370> of<00:04:35.490> pure<00:04:36.180> hue<00:04:36.750> as<00:04:37.080> when

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
you know it's kind of pure hue as when

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.110 
you know it's kind of pure hue as when
it's<00:04:37.350> next<00:04:37.560> screen<00:04:37.770> it's<00:04:38.430> their<00:04:38.730> kind<00:04:39.030> of

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
it's next screen it's their kind of

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.310 
it's next screen it's their kind of
color<00:04:39.270> combination<00:04:39.780> that<00:04:39.900> I'm<00:04:39.990> going<00:04:40.110> to<00:04:40.140> talk

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
color combination that I'm going to talk

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.500 
color combination that I'm going to talk
about<00:04:40.440> is<00:04:40.740> an<00:04:41.190> analogous<00:04:41.610> color<00:04:41.970> scheme<00:04:42.060> and

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
about is an analogous color scheme and

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.040 
about is an analogous color scheme and
basically<00:04:43.050> that<00:04:43.380> is<00:04:43.680> four<00:04:44.460> colors<00:04:44.850> or<00:04:45.390> so<00:04:45.690> it

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
basically that is four colors or so it

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.780 
basically that is four colors or so it
could<00:04:46.200> be<00:04:46.260> three<00:04:46.470> as<00:04:46.590> well<00:04:46.770> that<00:04:47.490> are<00:04:47.610> right

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
could be three as well that are right

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.330 
could be three as well that are right
next<00:04:48.150> to<00:04:48.390> each<00:04:48.480> other<00:04:48.750> on<00:04:49.050> the<00:04:49.290> color<00:04:49.470> wheel<00:04:49.650> so

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
next to each other on the color wheel so

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.070 
next to each other on the color wheel so
that<00:04:50.550> is<00:04:50.670> why<00:04:50.820> green<00:04:51.090> and<00:04:51.270> blue<00:04:51.450> looks<00:04:51.780> so

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
that is why green and blue looks so

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.290 
that is why green and blue looks so
great<00:04:52.470> together<00:04:52.680> it's<00:04:53.370> because<00:04:53.760> they<00:04:54.240> are

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
great together it's because they are

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.230 
great together it's because they are
next<00:04:54.840> to<00:04:54.930> each<00:04:55.080> other<00:04:55.140> on<00:04:55.380> the<00:04:55.470> cogwheel

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
next to each other on the cogwheel

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.670 
next to each other on the cogwheel
you<00:04:57.240> can<00:04:57.420> have<00:04:57.600> green<00:04:57.900> kind<00:04:58.230> of<00:04:58.350> go<00:04:58.470> more

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
you can have green kind of go more

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.700 
you can have green kind of go more
toward<00:04:58.980> yellow<00:04:59.630> or<00:05:00.630> green<00:05:00.960> go<00:05:01.230> toward<00:05:01.500> more

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
toward yellow or green go toward more

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.170 
toward yellow or green go toward more
blue<00:05:02.100> and<00:05:02.130> that<00:05:02.490> would<00:05:02.670> be<00:05:02.790> an<00:05:02.850> analogous

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
blue and that would be an analogous

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.740 
blue and that would be an analogous
color<00:05:03.330> scheme<00:05:04.100> this<00:05:05.100> is<00:05:05.280> a<00:05:05.310> really<00:05:05.790> in<00:05:06.120> color

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
color scheme this is a really in color

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.500 
color scheme this is a really in color
scheme<00:05:07.080> right<00:05:07.260> now<00:05:07.730> I'll<00:05:08.730> be<00:05:08.970> flashing<00:05:09.300> at

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.510 
scheme right now I'll be flashing at

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:10.730 
scheme right now I'll be flashing at
pictures<00:05:09.870> of<00:05:09.900> things<00:05:10.200> that<00:05:10.320> I've<00:05:10.500> seen

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
pictures of things that I've seen

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.040 
pictures of things that I've seen
recently<00:05:11.000> here's<00:05:12.000> kind<00:05:12.240> of<00:05:12.300> an<00:05:12.420> example<00:05:12.930> of

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
recently here's kind of an example of

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.840 
recently here's kind of an example of
some<00:05:13.230> colors<00:05:13.560> that<00:05:13.590> I<00:05:13.770> had<00:05:14.010> in<00:05:14.220> my<00:05:14.250> fabrics<00:05:14.760> -

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:16.850 
some colors that I had in my fabrics -

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.190 
some colors that I had in my fabrics -
this<00:05:17.850> green<00:05:18.090> is<00:05:18.210> a<00:05:18.270> little<00:05:18.300> too<00:05:18.840> light<00:05:19.020> it's

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.200 
this green is a little too light it's

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.650 
this green is a little too light it's
obvious<00:05:19.440> in<00:05:19.530> that<00:05:19.560> emerald<00:05:20.360> but<00:05:21.360> I'll<00:05:21.540> be

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 
obvious in that emerald but I'll be

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.140 
obvious in that emerald but I'll be
showing<00:05:21.810> you<00:05:21.960> some<00:05:22.050> examples<00:05:22.770> of<00:05:23.130> this<00:05:23.820> color

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
showing you some examples of this color

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.420 
showing you some examples of this color
combination<00:05:24.480> and<00:05:24.810> also<00:05:24.990> just<00:05:25.410> I've<00:05:26.010> seen<00:05:26.250> tons

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
combination and also just I've seen tons

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.360 
combination and also just I've seen tons
of<00:05:26.610> shoes<00:05:26.940> that<00:05:27.360> have<00:05:27.570> two-tone<00:05:28.320> green<00:05:28.650> and

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
of shoes that have two-tone green and

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.090 
of shoes that have two-tone green and
blue<00:05:29.820> going<00:05:30.390> on<00:05:30.630> within<00:05:30.870> the<00:05:31.080> same<00:05:31.410> shoe<00:05:31.800> and

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100 
blue going on within the same shoe and

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.880 
blue going on within the same shoe and
that<00:05:32.490> would<00:05:32.640> be<00:05:32.760> analogous<00:05:33.390> okay<00:05:34.290> so<00:05:34.350> now<00:05:34.710> that

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:34.890 
that would be analogous okay so now that

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:35.840 
that would be analogous okay so now that
I've<00:05:34.980> mentioned<00:05:35.190> it<00:05:35.430> to<00:05:35.520> you<00:05:35.610> you're<00:05:35.760> gonna

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:35.850 
I've mentioned it to you you're gonna

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.330 
I've mentioned it to you you're gonna
see<00:05:36.060> it<00:05:36.150> everywhere<00:05:36.480> I<00:05:36.540> promise<00:05:36.990> um<00:05:37.340> I'm

see it everywhere I promise um I'm
working<00:05:38.700> on<00:05:38.760> a<00:05:38.820> new<00:05:39.000> quilt<00:05:39.330> this<00:05:39.570> is<00:05:39.720> a

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
working on a new quilt this is a

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.590 
working on a new quilt this is a
spinning<00:05:40.290> stars<00:05:40.560> quilt<00:05:40.920> along<00:05:41.240> and<00:05:42.240> I'm<00:05:42.390> going

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.600 
spinning stars quilt along and I'm going

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.380 
spinning stars quilt along and I'm going
to<00:05:42.660> be<00:05:42.780> doing<00:05:42.930> it<00:05:43.169> in<00:05:43.260> an<00:05:43.410> analogous<00:05:44.270> kind<00:05:45.270> of

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:45.390 
to be doing it in an analogous kind of

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.750
