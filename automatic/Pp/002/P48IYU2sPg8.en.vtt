00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.389
 a cheap from the world of energy and 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.610
 Welcome to a trick mode 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.560
 multiplayer of grand theft auto 5 and 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.390
 this trick is to change the style of 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.430
 life the look of our character 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.779
 everything that can be changed in the menu 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.820
 from when we created for the first time 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.230
 our character and this we can 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.880
 do it with our character that 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.560
 we created a long time ago and as we already 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.480
 you know then you can not do it once 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.950
 that you have already changed it only 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.630
 can do with the characters that 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.070
 we just created vale so let's go to 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.110
 to do is create a bug to be able to 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.210
 modify the previous character of makes 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.860
 a lot of time and this is going to go very well for 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.660
 if we want to do some retouching or what 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.250
 let it be and so good then let's 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.680
 start with the tutorial of this trick 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.050
 well all the first thing we will have 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.030
 what to do is to be in online mode with 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.860
 our character we want 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.960
 modify that is the one that we have of already 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.160
 a long time ago and good to tell you what 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.350
 what we have to do is give the start 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.660
 let's go online we 're going to change 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.360
 character is valid and when we go up 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.489
 cloud I have to tell you very important 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.740
 that we have to erase the other character 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.149
 if you have another character you will have to 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.260
 erase it so I already tell you that if 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:13.570
 you have both characters enough 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.280
 with a lot of level and so say that 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.170
 you are going to have to erase one or that is 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.550
 you do not want if you have both very advanced 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.170
 as I said then do not do the trick 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.240
 but if you have according to does not have any 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.040
 character because you simply delete it or 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.930
 you already directly create one I'm going to 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.480
 delete the other one and I will create a new one 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.520
 when you create it only what there is 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.770
 what to do is to save and continue 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.690
 and we do not see any change or anything to not 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.400
 lose so much time when you ask us to 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.410
 if we want to do the tutorial again 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.880
 of the online, because we simply give 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.710
 omit because we're not going to do another 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.570
 time again and well then we wait for 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.520
 that the cloud goes down again and that we 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.560
 goal in online with the character that 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.420
 we just created and now what 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.820
 we will have to do with that character is 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.180
 give the start we go online we go to 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:57.580
 change character and we go back to catch 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.770
 the character of ours in our own 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.990
 the old one we want to change the 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.390
 Appearance worth is the first of all and 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.729
 Now when I come back again to lose 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.340
 the cloud because we simply go back another 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:11.200
 Once we start going online and we are going to 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.320
 change the u we're not going to change 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.480
 character again and this time finally 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.890
 when we select the character that 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.660
 we just created 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.970
 who will ask us good we selected it 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.890
 will ask us if we want to change in the 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.360
 appearance because it will be the only time 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.950
 we can do it and this is with the 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.720
 character that we just created that is what 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.190
 normal up here all normal since 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.830
 when you do it for the first time always 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.480
 with a new character because what happens 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.130
 is that he asks you this in case you want it 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.110
 change again just in case it's worth that 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.610
 you can change it once then what 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.560
 What we will do is create a fault in the 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.470
 game for this message to change 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.670
 the appearance appears in the other 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.010
 character in which we create already makes 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.950
 time is worth then when the 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.120
 This message of the warning is therefore worth 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.270
 what we have to do is give the 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.340
 ps button and give it to close session if you are 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.110
 of xbox I guess with pulling the cable then 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.030
 it's good and well when we're 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.220
 remove in the session what we will have to 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.410
 to do is simply to hit the button 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.420
 accept and take us to campaign mode 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.190
 when we are in campaign mode what 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.140
 we will have to do is give the start 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.790
 We will go online and what we will do is 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.380
 log in for it then 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.570
 we just go back to logging in 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.120
 Now what we have to do is 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:21.100
 give him to choose character and what 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.769
 we will do is choose the character that 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.790
 we want to change the appearance and how 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:26.709
 we can check 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.900
 We get the message that we want 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.939
 change the appearance we give you yes and 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.280
 we can change our taste 

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:35.019
 our character so old so 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.670
 Well, this has been everything if it has 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.799
