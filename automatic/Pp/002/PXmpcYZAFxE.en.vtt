00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.450 
arm it's very obvious it's something
that<00:01:43.140> I<00:01:43.170> didn't<00:01:43.530> see<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.649> ton<00:01:43.829> of<00:01:43.860> West<00:01:44.100> Virginia

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
that I didn't see a ton of West Virginia

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.639 
that I didn't see a ton of West Virginia
film<00:01:44.640> last<00:01:44.820> year<00:01:45.149> but<00:01:45.899> it's<00:01:46.079> it's<00:01:46.350> something

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
film last year but it's it's something

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.350 
film last year but it's it's something
that<00:01:46.770> jumps<00:01:46.950> off<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.520> know<00:01:47.579> why<00:01:47.820> watching<00:01:48.270> its

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
that jumps off you know why watching its

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.760 
that jumps off you know why watching its
kind<00:01:48.509> of<00:01:48.570> jumps<00:01:48.810> off<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:48.960> tape<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.470> use<00:01:49.590> that

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
kind of jumps off the tape to use that

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.020 
kind of jumps off the tape to use that
to<00:01:50.009> use<00:01:50.130> that<00:01:50.250> expression<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:50.790> know<00:01:50.880> what<00:01:50.970> I

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
to use that expression you know what I

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.630 
to use that expression you know what I
mean<00:01:51.060> mmm<00:01:51.540> I<00:01:52.200> agree<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:52.979> think<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.430> fact

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
mean mmm I agree and I think the fact

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.490 
mean mmm I agree and I think the fact
that<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.939> velocity<00:01:54.090> of<00:01:54.509> those<00:01:54.720> passes<00:01:55.229> he<00:01:55.350> has

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
that the velocity of those passes he has

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.130 
that the velocity of those passes he has
really<00:01:56.189> helps<00:01:56.909> him<00:01:57.149> that<00:01:57.540> that<00:01:57.659> works<00:01:57.899> really

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
really helps him that that works really

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.929 
really helps him that that works really
well<00:01:58.259> for<00:01:58.439> that<00:01:58.770> after<00:01:59.219> one<00:01:59.520> more<00:01:59.670> team

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
well for that after one more team

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.160 
well for that after one more team
session<00:02:00.360> here's<00:02:00.479> a<00:02:00.540> cool<00:02:00.719> moment<00:02:00.869> that

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
session here's a cool moment that

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.810 
session here's a cool moment that
happened<00:02:01.469> after<00:02:01.680> that<00:02:01.710> quarterbacks<00:02:02.399> playing

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
happened after that quarterbacks playing

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.289 
happened after that quarterbacks playing
I<00:02:03.329> guess<00:02:04.290> what<00:02:04.530> would<00:02:04.649> be<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.219> NFL<00:02:05.790> equivalent

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
I guess what would be the NFL equivalent

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.559 
I guess what would be the NFL equivalent
of<00:02:06.390> pepper<00:02:06.659> or<00:02:06.960> maybe<00:02:07.170> hot<00:02:07.469> potato<00:02:08.569> basically

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
of pepper or maybe hot potato basically

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.510 
of pepper or maybe hot potato basically
just<00:02:09.599> it<00:02:09.899> looks<00:02:10.200> like<00:02:10.319> a<00:02:10.349> drill<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:10.649> train<00:02:11.370> them

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
just it looks like a drill to train them

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.619 
just it looks like a drill to train them
to<00:02:11.550> get<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.849> ball<00:02:11.970> out<00:02:12.000> of<00:02:12.150> their<00:02:12.270> hands<00:02:12.480> as

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
to get the ball out of their hands as

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:14.260 
to get the ball out of their hands as
soon<00:02:12.780> as<00:02:12.900> I<00:02:12.959> get<00:02:13.080> it

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
soon as I get it

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:27.000 
soon as I get it

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
hitting I think he got a little bit

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.550 
hitting I think he got a little bit
everything<00:02:32.420> on<00:02:32.870> his<00:02:32.989> first<00:02:33.200> day<00:02:33.349> with<00:02:33.530> the

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
good he looked smooth some down field

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.490 
good he looked smooth some down field
passes<00:02:40.640> that<00:02:40.940> looked<00:02:41.239> good<00:02:41.480> still<00:02:42.200> he's<00:02:42.470> a
