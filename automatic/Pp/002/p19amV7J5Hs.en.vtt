00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:06.060
 just you have seen who in the 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.980
 today but we still here in 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.420
 the pcm we do not know what is happening 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.650
 let's see guys quickly we're going to 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.780
 see the runners being in the lead 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.370
 they saw the two forms of infant bing and 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.410
 we have a flag from androni 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.240
 giocattoli and to watch over part of the 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.880
 guys news first news 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.640
 we have cut in the squad we have here 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:31.710
 to our friend michael rogers and friends 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:32.700
 romney cut and with a somewhat position 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.219
 awkward 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.770
 is catching water will go up more 5 and 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.329
 wonderful pump according to more 5 today and 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.219
 I'm protecting accountant with julien 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.700
 without because he has previously made contact 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.860
 personal 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.210
 the guy suffering but guys this is what 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.680
 that is going to make 5 immediate forest for 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.390
 completely protect meter from 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.850
 any accident of any court 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.670
 any story total protection and 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.219
 only for counter counter is the only 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.989
 and absolute leader of the 5 there are no options 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.170
 to beat stages unless counter 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.899
 by some chance I had to leave the 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.800
 career but really the 5 party for 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.410
 to work 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.710
 by and for counter while running and 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.710
 roger 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.560
 contás also really good if it 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.240
 because many waste time we are going to 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.970
 give him a bolillo of water for good 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.740
 until the end and important guys and 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.320
 then it's important that I did not realize 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.790
 during the chrono meter loses 33 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.330
 second record is the time you lost 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:33.390
 with 5 it is true they were 22 as it turns out 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:38.240
 which counter lost contact with have 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:40.740
 been giving water 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.090
 meter has lost 11 more seconds and 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.590
 lost contact thing that I did not realize 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.450
 me during the time 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.320
 what if I had to have 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.810
 remained someone has to see if 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.490
 counter go for god good have been 11 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.590
 seconds could have been worse really 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.320
 but note that the theme of 99 have 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.660
 come to squeeze counter really 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.060
 that is the chronos is who really the 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.530
 also balanced but well that's what 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.200
 we all know it does not need to either 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.540
 explain it more the leak is 34 seconds 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.209
 4 minutes is romney and roger 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.850
 really good 5 but we do not care 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.340
 that what worries me is that counter 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.050
 and not waste any more time so I'm 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.610
 well let's put another string of 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.400
 assembly because I want all protection 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:23.270
 I do not want 60 meters is very hardcore 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.940
 yes, but I do not trust julien ni 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.130
 counter has counted between 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:33.410
 cottons 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:35.450
 and the rest we go serious no matter the 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.930
 rest also 80 but they hold well 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.690
 78 and control that is there of justice and 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.190
 protected good guys for you to wait 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.750
 of these first district days the 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.130
 sprints I surely good for sure 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.810
 you have already seen that you want to 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.540
 earned today is worth it because I have not yet 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.830
 seen but surely things are what 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.520
 more prettier a priori for the 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:57.140
 scripts sean greipel and michael matthews 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.970
 by names are the first 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.740
 they highlight more but also what they have in 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.900
 account people at best as mode what 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:06.440
 like that looking viviani that also of 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.810
 the best sprinters of how to 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.280
 fight the sprints Juan José Lobato 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.380
 can have many options should have 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.570
 some stage I can also have it 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.790
 ucam is gay brown hofland is I saw there 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.560
 a good range of sprinters and we'll see 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.660
 how are these first days already 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.250
 see if for example michael matthews and 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.520
 right now he has done well during the 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.470
 chrono during the prologue for the pardoned 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.330
 by teams no prologue because it has more 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.320
 of 10 kilometers since the team does 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.790
 has done well can have actions 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.790
 also to get 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:40.850
 but it really is not is not necessary 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.920
 rogers and rovny to 516 good and sorry 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.910
 is not super serious what was said and 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.620
 with everyone who is protected is what 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.570
 important really here makes the 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.150
 rest give me equal a typical books 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:52.760
 of people running over 10 people for 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.760
 goal we have to be here with 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:58.700
 protected counter and without losing a single 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.250
 second in case there is any cut we are going to 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.470
 see what else in career but what 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.500
 said I think of greipel matthews 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.880
 hofland juanjo lobato house I will put them 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.650
 in some arrival hairdresser would be the 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.330
 main sprinter there is in shake and there 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.070
 many records of good level and I 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.650
 I think we can see good sprints on 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:18.770
 last year remove the came dominator that 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.630
 it had to go to 34 days and it was already 

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:22.850
 one and the one that already destroyed the subject of the 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.870
 scripts but this year I think it's going to 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.790
 be more open last year 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.020
 I really believe I hope and have also 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.910
 said what I want to tell you there is 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.230
 a lot and splinter and that will surely be 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.210
 more open goal topic so that 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:33.320
 other years we will go in the head he does not 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.020
 I think that against I know that I have this 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.460
 rhythm 86 let's see the arrival you have 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.569
 now with everything for medium in bases 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.159
 then greet the same for Andrew Gray 

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:42.869
 in the fierce struggle for the 

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:44.520
 favorites that we will do in the beginning 

00:04:42.869 --> 00:04:47.069
 greipel that comes out as a clarification to 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.569
 lack of 23 I think it's a distance 

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:50.429
 too long I think it can stop at 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:52.319
 what level do we go to the maximum behind we have 

00:04:50.429 --> 00:04:53.369
 also my sister can see more a 

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:56.009
 good runner to get to the core 

00:04:53.369 --> 00:04:57.270
 they fit closed sprints and now also 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:59.399
 is making them an image that is 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:02.069
 recuperating endures flu very well but 

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:03.270
 ojito díaz then with saws comes 

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:04.589
 from behind Lucas tells me that he had very 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.779
 strong there is no that there is more that recovers 

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:07.889
 michael matthews come out michael macy 

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:09.209
 display to haussler by the 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:10.559
 left but mayer empty for the 

00:05:09.209 --> 00:05:13.619
 win in this is a stage of the turn of 

00:05:10.559 --> 00:05:16.800
 Italy very well ojito here to that 

00:05:13.619 --> 00:05:18.990
 the sprint the next contact that what 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.309
 does very well place where the novice and 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.139
 counters arrive heads true without 

00:05:20.309 --> 00:05:23.729
 correct then guys to third the cap 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:26.189
 second the jury comes out some stage 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:29.189
 Movidita and what he says he writes 

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:33.080
 real battles with so much with so much 

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:35.550
 cock I think the most serious the 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:38.490
 surely viviani we always fight 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:39.869
 missing team luca follows me nizzolo is 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.580
 that there are many sprints on youtube but 

00:05:39.869 --> 00:05:43.169
 especially Greipel image are the 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.819
 runners that highlight the boys more 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:46.289
 let's see the podium that we confirm 

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:48.089
 they lose time round and roger 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:49.409
 really what is said is the secondary and 

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:51.449
 counter stays very well in the 

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:53.879
 group with the pain with the protection of 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:56.599
 julien's in and of your data so today 

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:59.369
 an end and we'll see you guys tomorrow 

00:05:56.599 --> 00:06:01.800
 here we have the repeated arrival as 

00:05:59.369 --> 00:06:03.899
 michael matthews there is a very long sprint 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:07.229
 very good following wheel surpassing 

00:06:03.899 --> 00:06:08.759
 greipel ace at your pace very well very well 

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:10.469
 it seems that they simulated was going to recover more 

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:12.389
 pro really of the screen stands 

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:15.490
 note and we have the played of the of the 

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:18.970
 people getting run over 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:20.199
 typical typical of the pcm no 

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:21.550
 attack of this but yes that they do against 

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:23.050
 many things that you do not see for the end 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:25.180
 we have another a review of medium 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:27.759
 second 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:30.190
 haussler care so very well 

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:32.410

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:39.400
