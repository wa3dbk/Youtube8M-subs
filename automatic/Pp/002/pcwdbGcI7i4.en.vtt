00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:08.729 
we're going to carefully remove these
with<00:03:06.340> our<00:03:06.459> tool<00:03:06.760> and<00:03:07.230> we<00:03:08.230> built<00:03:08.409> up<00:03:08.530> some

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
with our tool and we built up some

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:11.250 
with our tool and we built up some
pressure<00:03:09.010> over<00:03:09.370> that<00:03:09.579> hour<00:03:10.269> and<00:03:10.480> 25<00:03:10.870> minutes

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
pressure over that hour and 25 minutes

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.680 
pressure over that hour and 25 minutes
whereas<00:03:11.769> these<00:03:12.040> cool<00:03:12.310> down<00:03:12.579> will<00:03:13.239> start<00:03:13.569> to

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
whereas these cool down will start to

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.110 
whereas these cool down will start to
hear<00:03:13.870> that<00:03:14.079> ping<00:03:14.519> the<00:03:15.519> middle<00:03:15.730> of<00:03:15.849> this<00:03:15.940> is

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
hear that ping the middle of this is

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.400 
hear that ping the middle of this is
going<00:03:16.269> to<00:03:16.329> start<00:03:16.510> to<00:03:16.629> pull<00:03:16.810> down<00:03:16.959> and<00:03:17.230> that's

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
going to start to pull down and that's

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.199 
going to start to pull down and that's
kind<00:03:17.620> of<00:03:17.650> our<00:03:17.799> indication<00:03:18.430> that<00:03:18.549> we've<00:03:18.700> safely

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
kind of our indication that we've safely

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.449 
kind of our indication that we've safely
packed<00:03:19.630> our<00:03:19.810> tomatoes<00:03:20.260> so<00:03:20.560> you<00:03:21.130> can<00:03:21.250> enjoy

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
packed our tomatoes so you can enjoy

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.030 
packed our tomatoes so you can enjoy
these<00:03:21.790> maybe<00:03:22.060> mid<00:03:22.329> winter<00:03:22.769> and<00:03:23.769> there<00:03:23.919> you<00:03:24.010> go

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
these maybe mid winter and there you go

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.299 
these maybe mid winter and there you go
somewhere<00:03:24.910> in<00:03:25.000> a<00:03:25.090> jar
