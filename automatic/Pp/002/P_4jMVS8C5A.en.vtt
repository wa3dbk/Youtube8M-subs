00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
bit closer to answering our question we

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.590 
bit closer to answering our question we
have<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.549> talk<00:01:50.729> about<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.210> heat<00:01:51.390> lamp

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
have to talk about the heat lamp

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.109 
have to talk about the heat lamp
demonstration<00:01:52.350> also<00:01:53.280> known<00:01:53.490> as<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.880> French

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
demonstration also known as the French

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.740 
demonstration also known as the French
fry<00:01:54.360> lap

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.590 

you<00:01:58.350> see<00:01:58.590> there's<00:01:59.310> actually<00:01:59.520> heat<00:02:00.150> coming<00:02:00.510> out

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
you see there's actually heat coming out

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.500 
you see there's actually heat coming out
of<00:02:00.660> this<00:02:00.780> box<00:02:01.100> but<00:02:02.100> that<00:02:02.280> might<00:02:02.850> not<00:02:03.090> be<00:02:03.300> the

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
of this box but that might not be the

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.210 
of this box but that might not be the
appropriate<00:02:03.600> term<00:02:04.350> we<00:02:04.590> should<00:02:04.620> use<00:02:04.980> for<00:02:05.130> this

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
appropriate term we should use for this

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.520 
appropriate term we should use for this
demonstration<00:02:05.810> we<00:02:06.810> might<00:02:06.990> ought<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.260> consider

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
demonstration we might ought to consider

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.880 
demonstration we might ought to consider
calling<00:02:07.680> it<00:02:08.070> the<00:02:09.000> burn<00:02:09.210> box<00:02:09.710> because<00:02:10.710> see

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
calling it the burn box because see

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.820 
calling it the burn box because see
we're<00:02:11.130> blasting<00:02:11.760> our<00:02:11.880> customer<00:02:12.450> with<00:02:12.600> an

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
we're blasting our customer with an

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.150 
we're blasting our customer with an
exaggerated<00:02:14.720> 250<00:02:15.720> watt<00:02:15.870> bulb<00:02:16.290> of<00:02:16.560> infrared

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
exaggerated 250 watt bulb of infrared

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.340 
exaggerated 250 watt bulb of infrared
radiation<00:02:17.660> yeah<00:02:18.660> there's<00:02:18.870> a<00:02:18.930> little<00:02:19.170> heat

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
radiation yeah there's a little heat

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.880 
radiation yeah there's a little heat
there<00:02:19.590> but<00:02:20.160> it's<00:02:20.280> an<00:02:20.400> IR<00:02:20.730> bulb<00:02:21.060> in<00:02:21.390> IR<00:02:22.020> does

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
there but it's an IR bulb in IR does

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.500 
there but it's an IR bulb in IR does
something<00:02:23.280> that<00:02:23.430> we<00:02:23.520> don't<00:02:23.700> even<00:02:23.820> think<00:02:23.940> about

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
something that we don't even think about

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.170 
something that we don't even think about
it<00:02:25.470> actually<00:02:25.730> creates<00:02:26.730> a<00:02:26.850> perception<00:02:27.570> of<00:02:27.780> heat

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
it actually creates a perception of heat

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.060 
it actually creates a perception of heat
IR<00:02:30.180> has<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.600> longest<00:02:31.080> wavelength<00:02:31.709> out<00:02:31.920> of

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
IR has the longest wavelength out of

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.400 
IR has the longest wavelength out of
anything<00:02:32.790> coming<00:02:33.030> at<00:02:33.180> you<00:02:33.300> from<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.510> Sun<00:02:33.810> it

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
anything coming at you from the Sun it

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.980 
anything coming at you from the Sun it
penetrates<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.100> skin<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.670> deepest<00:02:36.180> it<00:02:36.750> goes

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
penetrates the skin the deepest it goes

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.860 
penetrates the skin the deepest it goes
so<00:02:37.230> far<00:02:37.470> in<00:02:37.620> our<00:02:37.709> skin<00:02:38.040> it<00:02:38.190> actually<00:02:38.870> irritates

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
so far in our skin it actually irritates

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.750 
so far in our skin it actually irritates
nerve<00:02:40.170> endings<00:02:40.590> which<00:02:40.980> sends<00:02:41.250> signals<00:02:41.640> to<00:02:41.730> our

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
nerve endings which sends signals to our

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.210 
nerve endings which sends signals to our
brain<00:02:41.959> our<00:02:42.959> brain<00:02:42.990> perceives<00:02:43.770> that

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
brain our brain perceives that

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.600 
brain our brain perceives that
irritation<00:02:44.700> as<00:02:45.300> heat<00:02:46.080> it's<00:02:46.530> not<00:02:46.709> heat<00:02:46.980> you

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
irritation as heat it's not heat you

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.070 
irritation as heat it's not heat you
can't<00:02:47.850> measure<00:02:48.030> it<00:02:48.150> with<00:02:48.330> a<00:02:48.360> thermometer<00:02:48.690> but

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
can't measure it with a thermometer but

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.250 
can't measure it with a thermometer but
you<00:02:49.709> know<00:02:49.830> what<00:02:50.070> you<00:02:50.550> put<00:02:50.730> on<00:02:50.850> an<00:02:50.970> IR<00:02:51.300> film<00:02:51.570> with

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
you know what you put on an IR film with

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.220 
you know what you put on an IR film with
a<00:02:52.290> good<00:02:52.590> IR<00:02:53.220> number<00:02:53.550> on<00:02:53.670> it<00:02:53.820> we<00:02:54.780> can<00:02:54.930> make<00:02:55.080> that

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
a good IR number on it we can make that

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.260 
a good IR number on it we can make that
burn<00:02:55.440> go<00:02:55.680> away<00:02:55.950> let's<00:02:56.910> say<00:02:57.030> you're<00:02:57.150> driving

I focus on what the window film does it
blocks<00:03:43.140> out<00:03:43.380> solar<00:03:43.709> energy<00:03:44.310> and<00:03:44.580> then<00:03:45.120> I<00:03:45.150> talk

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
blocks out solar energy and then I talk

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.880 
blocks out solar energy and then I talk
to<00:03:45.570> the<00:03:45.690> customer<00:03:46.080> about<00:03:46.170> what<00:03:46.530> is<00:03:46.650> solar
