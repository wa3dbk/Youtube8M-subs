I'll<00:02:26.239> have<00:02:26.959> as<00:02:27.020> much<00:02:27.140> output<00:02:27.380> as<00:02:27.680> stiffer<00:02:28.010> does

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
I'll have as much output as stiffer does

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.030 
I'll have as much output as stiffer does
but<00:02:28.670> it<00:02:29.569> will<00:02:29.750> not<00:02:29.870> light<00:02:30.110> off<00:02:30.380> the<00:02:30.560> output<00:02:31.010> of

capacitor via this yellow lead this
capacitor<00:02:52.700> right<00:02:52.880> here<00:02:53.180> but<00:02:53.690> it<00:02:53.810> works<00:02:53.989> just

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
capacitor right here but it works just

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.199 
capacitor right here but it works just
as<00:02:54.380> good<00:02:54.550> directly<00:02:55.550> driven<00:02:56.080> if<00:02:57.080> I<00:02:57.200> do<00:02:57.260> this<00:02:58.209> and

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
as good directly driven if I do this and

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.199 
as good directly driven if I do this and
I<00:02:59.450> might<00:02:59.630> have<00:02:59.840> to<00:02:59.870> D<00:03:00.580> tuna<00:03:01.580> just<00:03:01.760> a<00:03:01.880> little<00:03:02.090> bit

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
I might have to D tuna just a little bit

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:03.910 
I might have to D tuna just a little bit
you<00:03:02.330> see<00:03:02.510> I<00:03:02.540> can<00:03:02.810> bear<00:03:02.989> the<00:03:03.110> frequency<00:03:03.680> here

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
you see I can bear the frequency here

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.670 
you see I can bear the frequency here
and<00:03:04.069> make<00:03:04.340> it<00:03:04.519> peak<00:03:04.819> but<00:03:05.750> it's<00:03:06.230> working<00:03:06.530> like<00:03:06.650> a

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
and make it peak but it's working like a

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.340 
and make it peak but it's working like a
50<00:03:06.980> megahertz<00:03:07.600> Tesla<00:03:08.600> coil<00:03:08.810> or<00:03:08.959> something<00:03:09.260> to

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
50 megahertz Tesla coil or something to

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.039 
50 megahertz Tesla coil or something to
that<00:03:09.380> effect<00:03:09.829> it<00:03:10.010> does<00:03:10.220> definitely<00:03:11.049> amplify

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
that effect it does definitely amplify

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:13.569 
that effect it does definitely amplify
the<00:03:12.110> peak<00:03:12.410> voltage<00:03:12.590> and<00:03:12.950> does<00:03:13.100> something<00:03:13.340> here

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:13.579 
the peak voltage and does something here

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:15.819 
the peak voltage and does something here
so<00:03:13.850> we'll<00:03:14.630> continue<00:03:14.840> working<00:03:15.230> on<00:03:15.410> it<00:03:15.530> just<00:03:15.680> one

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829 
so we'll continue working on it just one

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:19.660 
so we'll continue working on it just one
let<00:03:16.010> you<00:03:16.130> know<00:03:16.280> that<00:03:16.549> we're<00:03:17.239> close<00:03:18.489> you<00:03:19.489> can

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
let you know that we're close you can

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.780 
let you know that we're close you can

Stifler said to do and everything the

Stifler said to do and everything the
more<00:03:48.109> stuff<00:03:48.530> I<00:03:48.620> put<00:03:48.829> around<00:03:49.070> it<00:03:49.280> lower<00:03:49.790> the

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
more stuff I put around it lower the

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.270 
more stuff I put around it lower the
signal<00:03:50.359> level<00:03:50.480> out<00:03:50.780> just<00:03:51.350> the<00:03:51.470> probe<00:03:51.829> layin

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
signal level out just the probe layin

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.810 
signal level out just the probe layin
there<00:03:52.489> will<00:03:52.760> decrease<00:03:53.630> output<00:03:54.170> and<00:03:54.799> again<00:03:55.400> mr.

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
there will decrease output and again mr.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:01.210 
there will decrease output and again mr.
speak<00:03:56.120> it<00:03:56.269> and<00:03:59.049> my<00:04:00.049> next<00:04:00.109> step<00:04:00.560> I<00:04:00.769> believe<00:04:01.040> is

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
speak it and my next step I believe is

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.949 
speak it and my next step I believe is
going<00:04:01.370> to<00:04:01.519> drive<00:04:01.730> this<00:04:01.910> thing<00:04:02.150> with<00:04:02.329> an<00:04:02.420> SEC

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
going to drive this thing with an SEC

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:04.270 
going to drive this thing with an SEC
and<00:04:03.079> loop<00:04:03.200> it<00:04:03.320> back<00:04:03.380> and<00:04:03.739> see<00:04:03.890> what<00:04:04.010> the<00:04:04.130> hell

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
and loop it back and see what the hell

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.729 
and loop it back and see what the hell
happens<00:04:04.310> kind<00:04:05.000> of<00:04:05.060> curious<00:04:05.350> but<00:04:06.350> anyway

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
happens kind of curious but anyway

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:09.009 
happens kind of curious but anyway
that's<00:04:07.040> it<00:04:07.310> then<00:04:07.970> from<00:04:08.180> world's<00:04:08.480> smallest<00:04:08.690> lab

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
that's it then from world's smallest lab

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:11.770 
that's it then from world's smallest lab
having<00:04:09.620> fun<00:04:09.799> it's<00:04:10.639> a<00:04:10.790> great<00:04:10.970> day<00:04:11.180> and<00:04:11.449> we'll

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
having fun it's a great day and we'll
