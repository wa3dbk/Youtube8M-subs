00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:08.220
 I'm going to try to show you how 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.290
 i do it 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.780
 one with pictures 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:17.820
 I have another container this is decoupage 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:20.880
 glue and that work sets as much 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.189
 I do a layer with the cupboard 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.060
 I just have a picture of the 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.060
 call butterflies 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.199
 press a hedge of those lines over one 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.520
 piece 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.290
 when I end up on my own 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:39.380
 bottle jar 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.380
 I know what wants to stick 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.770
 I have done this just from the May 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.190
 printed there not for sale irrigation and 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.190
 we make 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.920
 Hey 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:15.729
 for part of the film it is dry 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:18.159
 then do another layer that smears with 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:20.110
 baskets with my brushes in the other direction 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.600
 so I blazon from top to bottom 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.890
 now goes from left to right 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:29.920
 and that actually do that kind of me 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:34.679
 clean use there 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.679
 flour the less also better and cd's hour 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:45.329
 we are back and we are going okay 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:45.329
 find a moment 

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:54.009
 days there very fast normally I leave that 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.659
 just somewhere and q4x or this doesn't matter 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:02:01.979
 this simply leaves completely dry by hand 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:05.380
 become after going to do and above 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:10.450
 just go down with the brush 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:11.709
 over yes i like the tourist yourself 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.920
 easy with the crash course 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.329
 Utilities do a sponge but 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.709
 so little roll and maybe so 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:20.350
 well you suffered 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:22.269
 no , oblique brush does my cupboard 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.150
 good clean but can is blue line 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:25.810
 leftovers in here too and I could not 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.650
 use more 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.650
 not convenient 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.700
 make it as far as it wants it to be 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.000
 once 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.000
 to fill 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.480
 now look three layers of a thousand illness like that 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.490
 from 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.400
 no i am i really see you there 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:17.040
 is just sort of complaining about now 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:19.950
 turn and beans and then make it 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:23.940
 fingers clubbing in a little water and then 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.510
 I go over the paper so I had to 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.710
 front 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:31.670
 You edit and you need decoupage glue 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:38.630
 I am going to be able to turn with a wet finger 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:38.630
 and then you see that I could per pf 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:50.850
 kumtich and what i do is that i thought 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:54.750
 do it once 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:56.910
 well I really let it dry for 24 hours and 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:01.970
 then I do it again but now just 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:04.290
 just do you just see the idea is 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.269
 because if you put every bike in scheemda 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:09.260
 Dryer 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:14.040
 I think that a fine can see better 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:17.070
 in the end I think that's real 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:22.169
 CDs can't I actually see that now 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:26.870
 there is good going and you crazy 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:26.870
 so you just want to get rid of paper 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:35.430
 well then you cut home he is free 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.790
 scriptures knees then it doesn't matter will 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.790
 I rest more 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:54.880
 and now you may say to that 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:59.460
 nicely done but not so well again 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.460
 quick to show you and seliga 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:07.420
 and then that is now of course there is not 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:10.470
 moor tasks 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:10.470
 dry blow dry 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:22.540
 so look 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.540
 workgroup this 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.600
 then I grab a portion 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:38.330
 and the would actually just be more 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:42.550
 paper, but this video is 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:46.010

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:08.180
 I just stick it like this 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:11.080
 tap with that decoupage glue 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.080
