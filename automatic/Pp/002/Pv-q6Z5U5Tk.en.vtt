at<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.540> top<00:02:21.780> and<00:02:22.140> we're<00:02:22.260> kind<00:02:22.920> of<00:02:22.980> rolling

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
at the top and we're kind of rolling

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.140 
at the top and we're kind of rolling
down<00:02:23.550> the<00:02:24.390> dumps<00:02:24.720> have<00:02:24.870> a<00:02:24.900> snakeskin

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
down the dumps have a snakeskin

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.180 
down the dumps have a snakeskin
technology<00:02:27.150> for<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.630> sidewalls<00:02:28.140> supposed<00:02:29.100> to

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
technology for the sidewalls supposed to

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.430 
technology for the sidewalls supposed to
be<00:02:29.310> real<00:02:29.580> tough<00:02:29.880> Kevlar<00:02:30.780> reinforced<00:02:31.970> and<00:02:33.440> I

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
be real tough Kevlar reinforced and I

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.620 
be real tough Kevlar reinforced and I
was<00:02:35.010> wondering<00:02:35.490> how<00:02:35.520> it<00:02:35.730> would<00:02:35.850> do<00:02:36.000> with<00:02:36.270> the

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
was wondering how it would do with the

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.910 
was wondering how it would do with the
sharp<00:02:37.620> rocks<00:02:38.010> a<00:02:38.460> lot<00:02:38.970> of<00:02:39.260> dinosaur<00:02:40.260> teeth<00:02:40.530> and

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
sharp rocks a lot of dinosaur teeth and

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.900 
sharp rocks a lot of dinosaur teeth and
and<00:02:41.630> really<00:02:42.630> nasty<00:02:43.020> shale<00:02:43.910> uncomfortably

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
and really nasty shale uncomfortably

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.840 
and really nasty shale uncomfortably
numb<00:02:45.740> as<00:02:46.740> you<00:02:46.890> can<00:02:47.010> see<00:02:47.130> a<00:02:47.160> lot<00:02:47.370> of<00:02:47.400> slick<00:02:47.640> rock

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
numb as you can see a lot of slick rock

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:55.090 
numb as you can see a lot of slick rock
too<00:02:48.090> and<00:02:48.800> so<00:02:49.800> long<00:02:51.230> no<00:02:52.230> no<00:02:52.740> issues<00:02:53.070> really

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
too and so long no no issues really

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.790 
too and so long no no issues really
again<00:02:56.100> these<00:02:56.310> drops<00:02:57.150> are<00:02:57.570> a<00:02:57.840> lot<00:02:58.170> steeper<00:02:58.500> than

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
again these drops are a lot steeper than

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.920 
again these drops are a lot steeper than
the<00:02:59.100> video<00:02:59.730> makes<00:03:00.120> them<00:03:00.240> appear<00:03:01.520> but<00:03:02.720> so<00:03:03.720> far

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
the video makes them appear but so far

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.420 
the video makes them appear but so far
so<00:03:04.110> good

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
so good

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.210 
so good
up<00:03:06.300> at<00:03:06.510> the<00:03:06.630> top<00:03:06.900> we<00:03:07.290> drop<00:03:07.560> the<00:03:07.740> pressure<00:03:07.950> down

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
up at the top we drop the pressure down

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.280 
up at the top we drop the pressure down
about<00:03:08.550> 24<00:03:09.180> I<00:03:09.210> think<00:03:09.740> for<00:03:10.740> the<00:03:10.890> downward<00:03:11.370> roll

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
about 24 I think for the downward roll

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.110 
about 24 I think for the downward roll
just<00:03:13.290> to<00:03:13.440> see<00:03:13.620> how<00:03:14.280> much<00:03:14.430> difference<00:03:14.820> of<00:03:14.940> may

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
just to see how much difference of may

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.290 
just to see how much difference of may
and<00:03:15.750> we<00:03:16.050> didn't<00:03:16.320> really<00:03:16.410> notice<00:03:16.680> that<00:03:16.860> much

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
and we didn't really notice that much

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:24.080 
and we didn't really notice that much
mmm<00:03:18.330> still<00:03:19.020> tracking<00:03:19.610> pretty<00:03:20.610> well<00:03:22.880> see<00:03:23.880> these

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
mmm still tracking pretty well see these

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
mmm still tracking pretty well see these
loose<00:03:24.390> sections<00:03:24.770> always<00:03:25.770> are<00:03:25.950> fun<00:03:27.110> and

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
loose sections always are fun and

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:34.400 
loose sections always are fun and
comfortably<00:03:29.100> numb'<00:03:31.370> basically<00:03:32.370> is<00:03:33.410> classic

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
comfortably numb' basically is classic

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.190 
comfortably numb' basically is classic
whistler<00:03:34.860> here's<00:03:35.340> a<00:03:35.400> real<00:03:35.640> steep<00:03:36.060> ramp<00:03:36.450> this

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
whistler here's a real steep ramp this

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.640 
whistler here's a real steep ramp this
thing<00:03:37.560> goes<00:03:38.070> straight<00:03:38.550> down<00:03:39.260> and<00:03:40.260> you<00:03:40.320> just

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
thing goes straight down and you just

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.560 
thing goes straight down and you just
basically<00:03:40.800> roll<00:03:41.340> it<00:03:41.580> and<00:03:41.850> then<00:03:42.060> you<00:03:42.450> got

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
basically roll it and then you got

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:48.170 
basically roll it and then you got
another<00:03:42.660> one<00:03:43.020> right<00:03:43.410> after<00:03:43.680> that<00:03:46.670> and<00:03:47.670> then

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
another one right after that and then

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.820 
another one right after that and then
this<00:03:48.420> is<00:03:48.600> kind<00:03:48.900> of<00:03:48.959> like<00:03:49.110> getting<00:03:49.320> toward<00:03:49.709> the

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
this is kind of like getting toward the

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.750 
this is kind of like getting toward the
final<00:03:50.250> section<00:03:50.580> of<00:03:51.000> the<00:03:51.690> trail<00:03:52.230> a<00:03:52.670> lot<00:03:53.670> of

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
final section of the trail a lot of

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.130 
final section of the trail a lot of
loose<00:03:53.970> stuff<00:03:54.300> I<00:03:55.160> was<00:03:56.600> really<00:03:57.600> impressed<00:03:57.990> with

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
loose stuff I was really impressed with

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:05.540 
loose stuff I was really impressed with
how<00:03:59.840> the<00:04:00.840> dobbs<00:04:01.110> hung<00:04:01.470> on<00:04:04.040> going<00:04:05.040> up<00:04:05.130> over<00:04:05.400> this

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 
how the dobbs hung on going up over this

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.920 
how the dobbs hung on going up over this
stuff<00:04:05.850> no<00:04:06.600> problems<00:04:07.110> I<00:04:07.380> kept<00:04:07.590> waiting<00:04:07.770> for

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
stuff no problems I kept waiting for

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.750 
stuff no problems I kept waiting for
you<00:04:09.140> know<00:04:09.230> the<00:04:09.379> spin<00:04:09.620> out<00:04:09.830> on<00:04:10.310> these<00:04:10.519> little

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
you know the spin out on these little

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.539 
you know the spin out on these little
risers<00:04:12.069> no<00:04:13.069> real<00:04:13.280> issues<00:04:13.930> fact<00:04:14.930> I<00:04:15.049> was

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:15.549 
risers no real issues fact I was

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:17.620 
risers no real issues fact I was
surprised<00:04:16.549> a<00:04:16.760> couple<00:04:17.060> times<00:04:17.299> because

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
surprised a couple times because

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:18.930 
surprised a couple times because
normally<00:04:18.019> you<00:04:18.169> pop<00:04:18.350> out<00:04:18.530> of<00:04:18.560> the<00:04:18.709> saddle

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
normally you pop out of the saddle

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.570 
normally you pop out of the saddle
you're<00:04:19.940> gonna<00:04:20.030> feel<00:04:20.329> a<00:04:20.949> little<00:04:21.949> spin<00:04:22.190> out<00:04:22.340> in

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
you're gonna feel a little spin out in

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.550 
you're gonna feel a little spin out in
the<00:04:22.760> rear<00:04:23.080> but<00:04:24.080> it<00:04:24.740> wasn't<00:04:25.130> happening

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
the rear but it wasn't happening

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:33.310 
the rear but it wasn't happening
everything<00:04:27.560> was<00:04:27.710> going<00:04:27.979> fine<00:04:31.600> some<00:04:32.600> more<00:04:32.840> some

more the more the same you don't want to

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.600 
more the more the same you don't want to
fall<00:04:35.990> up<00:04:36.320> uncomfortably<00:04:36.979> numb<00:04:37.100> at<00:04:37.430> this

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
fall up uncomfortably numb at this

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.700 
fall up uncomfortably numb at this
section<00:04:38.000> anyway<00:04:38.270> this<00:04:38.449> is<00:04:38.600> the<00:04:38.630> tail<00:04:39.050> end<00:04:39.080> it's

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
section anyway this is the tail end it's

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.430 
section anyway this is the tail end it's
generally<00:04:40.400> written<00:04:40.520> from<00:04:40.850> north<00:04:41.090> to<00:04:41.180> south<00:04:41.440> we

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
generally written from north to south we

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.870 
generally written from north to south we
just<00:04:42.650> pushed<00:04:42.889> up<00:04:43.100> on<00:04:43.250> the<00:04:43.370> south<00:04:43.580> side<00:04:43.820> and

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
just pushed up on the south side and

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.020 
just pushed up on the south side and
then<00:04:44.150> came<00:04:44.330> back<00:04:44.360> down<00:04:45.550> because<00:04:46.550> we<00:04:46.669> wanted<00:04:46.940> to

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
then came back down because we wanted to

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
then came back down because we wanted to
get<00:04:47.150> the<00:04:47.270> tasty<00:04:47.660> bits<00:04:47.900> and<00:04:49.810> there's<00:04:50.810> just<00:04:50.990> a

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
get the tasty bits and there's just a

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.629 
get the tasty bits and there's just a
lot<00:04:51.199> of<00:04:51.229> rock<00:04:51.530> and<00:04:51.830> I<00:04:51.889> mean<00:04:52.039> everything<00:04:52.490> is

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:52.639 
lot of rock and I mean everything is

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:53.290 
lot of rock and I mean everything is
hard

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
hard

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.159 
hard
so<00:04:54.020> again<00:04:55.010> real<00:04:55.490> steep<00:04:55.850> and<00:04:56.150> breaking<00:04:57.080> the

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:57.169 
so again real steep and breaking the

00:04:57.169 --> 00:04:59.710 
so again real steep and breaking the
hallway<00:04:57.500> just<00:04:57.860> see<00:04:58.190> if<00:04:58.370> there's<00:04:58.610> any<00:04:58.789> issues

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 
hallway just see if there's any issues

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:07.650
