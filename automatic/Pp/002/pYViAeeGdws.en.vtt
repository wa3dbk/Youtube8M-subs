this<00:00:01.469> is<00:00:01.650> a<00:00:01.770> video<00:00:02.129> on<00:00:02.399> classifying<00:00:03.030> rational

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
this is a video on classifying rational

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.099 
this is a video on classifying rational
numbers<00:00:04.490> to<00:00:05.490> classify<00:00:05.970> rational<00:00:06.480> numbers

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
numbers to classify rational numbers

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.320 
numbers to classify rational numbers
we<00:00:07.379> can<00:00:07.529> use<00:00:07.680> a<00:00:07.710> Venn<00:00:08.040> diagram<00:00:08.580> to<00:00:08.820> help

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
we can use a Venn diagram to help

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.580 
we can use a Venn diagram to help
separate<00:00:10.139> each<00:00:10.380> set<00:00:10.800> numbers<00:00:11.580> belong<00:00:11.880> to<00:00:12.590> the

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
separate each set numbers belong to the

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.770 
separate each set numbers belong to the
first<00:00:13.830> set<00:00:14.070> would<00:00:14.309> be<00:00:14.429> whole<00:00:14.730> numbers<00:00:15.210> whole

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
first set would be whole numbers whole

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.570 
first set would be whole numbers whole
numbers<00:00:15.809> of<00:00:16.260> being<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.500> center<00:00:16.949> because

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
numbers of being the center because

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.130 
numbers of being the center because
there<00:00:17.850> are<00:00:17.940> very<00:00:18.150> specific<00:00:18.359> characteristics

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
there are very specific characteristics

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.230 
there are very specific characteristics
of<00:00:19.260> whole<00:00:19.380> numbers<00:00:19.710> to<00:00:20.220> be<00:00:20.340> whole<00:00:20.580> you<00:00:20.609> have<00:00:21.060> to

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
of whole numbers to be whole you have to

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.689 
of whole numbers to be whole you have to
be<00:00:21.539> 0<00:00:21.869> or<00:00:22.260> any<00:00:23.130> positive<00:00:23.880> number<00:00:25.189> the<00:00:26.189> next<00:00:26.369> set

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
be 0 or any positive number the next set

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.710 
be 0 or any positive number the next set
is<00:00:27.320> integers<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:28.670> again<00:00:29.670> integers<00:00:30.150> has<00:00:30.390> very

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
is integers and again integers has very

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.260 
is integers and again integers has very
specific<00:00:30.900> criteria<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:32.160> be<00:00:32.250> an<00:00:32.340> integer<00:00:32.579> you

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
specific criteria to be an integer you

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.450 
specific criteria to be an integer you
have<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.510> be<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.630> positive<00:00:33.899> or<00:00:34.469> negative<00:00:34.530> whole

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
have to be a positive or negative whole

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.810 
have to be a positive or negative whole
number<00:00:35.850> so<00:00:36.649> negative<00:00:37.649> whole<00:00:38.160> numbers<00:00:38.219> would

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
number so negative whole numbers would

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.970 
number so negative whole numbers would
go<00:00:38.969> in<00:00:39.090> this<00:00:39.210> circle<00:00:39.629> whereas<00:00:40.140> positive<00:00:40.800> whole

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
go in this circle whereas positive whole

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.060 
go in this circle whereas positive whole
numbers<00:00:41.280> would<00:00:41.460> go<00:00:41.489> in<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.790> first<00:00:42.000> circle<00:00:42.210> and

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
numbers would go in the first circle and

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.490 
numbers would go in the first circle and
the<00:00:44.070> last<00:00:44.539> classification<00:00:45.539> or<00:00:45.809> set<00:00:46.350> of

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
the last classification or set of

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.540 
the last classification or set of
numbers<00:00:46.920> is<00:00:47.989> rational<00:00:48.989> numbers<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.680> rational

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
numbers is rational numbers and rational

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.639 
numbers is rational numbers and rational
numbers<00:00:50.850> is<00:00:51.090> everything<00:00:51.930> else<00:00:52.050> we<00:00:52.230> see<00:00:52.440> in<00:00:52.530> our

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
numbers is everything else we see in our

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.279 
numbers is everything else we see in our
world<00:00:52.910> such<00:00:53.910> as<00:00:53.940> fractions<00:00:54.570> decimals<00:00:54.840> and

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
world such as fractions decimals and

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.350 
world such as fractions decimals and
percents<00:00:56.039> they<00:00:56.430> can<00:00:56.610> be<00:00:56.699> negative<00:00:57.149> or

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
percents they can be negative or

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.010 
percents they can be negative or
positive<00:00:57.620> fraction<00:00:58.620> decimals<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.129> percents

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
positive fraction decimals and percents

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.160 
positive fraction decimals and percents
but<00:01:01.020> they<00:01:01.140> cannot<00:01:01.590> repeat<00:01:02.510> with<00:01:03.510> an<00:01:03.750> unknown

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
but they cannot repeat with an unknown

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.410 
but they cannot repeat with an unknown
pattern<00:01:04.710> if<00:01:04.920> they<00:01:05.250> repeat<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.880> has<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.240> be<00:01:06.390> a

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
pattern if they repeat it has to be a

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.359 
pattern if they repeat it has to be a
definite<00:01:07.020> pattern<00:01:07.200> like<00:01:07.590> we<00:01:07.740> can<00:01:07.950> predict

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
definite pattern like we can predict

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.609 
definite pattern like we can predict
what<00:01:08.640> number<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.119> next<00:01:10.670> so<00:01:11.670> for<00:01:11.880> example<00:01:12.619> whole

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
what number is next so for example whole

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.410 
what number is next so for example whole
numbers<00:01:14.010> would<00:01:14.729> be<00:01:14.760> 0<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:16.040> 1000<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.420> another

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
numbers would be 0 and 1000 and another

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.520 
numbers would be 0 and 1000 and another
example<00:01:19.490> would<00:01:20.490> be<00:01:20.700> something<00:01:20.970> like<00:01:22.280> 15

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
example would be something like 15

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.740 
example would be something like 15
divided<00:01:25.530> by<00:01:25.650> 3<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.090> might<00:01:27.270> be<00:01:27.390> thinking

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
divided by 3 and you might be thinking

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.420 
divided by 3 and you might be thinking
to<00:01:27.780> yourself<00:01:27.869> well<00:01:28.439> that's<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.680> fraction<00:01:28.920> how

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
to yourself well that's a fraction how

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.410 
to yourself well that's a fraction how
is<00:01:29.579> that<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:29.790> whole<00:01:30.060> number

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
is that a whole number

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.890 
is that a whole number
well<00:01:30.990> 15<00:01:31.500> divided<00:01:31.890> by<00:01:31.920> 3<00:01:32.009> is<00:01:32.340> 5<00:01:32.520> therefore<00:01:33.329> it

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
well 15 divided by 3 is 5 therefore it

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.020 
well 15 divided by 3 is 5 therefore it
can<00:01:34.049> stay<00:01:34.290> in<00:01:34.320> as<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.770> whole<00:01:35.220> number<00:01:37.790> the<00:01:38.790> next

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
can stay in as a whole number the next

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.819 
can stay in as a whole number the next
category

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:39.829 
category

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:43.130 
category
integers<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.939> again<00:01:42.270> integers<00:01:42.899> is<00:01:43.020> where

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
integers a and again integers is where

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.480 
integers a and again integers is where
the<00:01:43.229> negative<00:01:43.470> whole<00:01:43.829> numbers<00:01:43.890> will<00:01:44.310> go

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
the negative whole numbers will go

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.429 
the negative whole numbers will go
because<00:01:45.060> our<00:01:45.360> positive<00:01:45.869> whole<00:01:46.020> numbers<00:01:46.350> are

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
because our positive whole numbers are

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.859 
because our positive whole numbers are
in<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.649> first<00:01:46.890> circle<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:48.060> second<00:01:48.479> circle

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
in the first circle the second circle

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.889 
in the first circle the second circle
negative<00:01:49.680> 7<00:01:50.070> negative<00:01:50.100> 81<00:01:50.729> negative<00:01:51.479> 1<00:01:51.780> are

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
negative 7 negative 81 negative 1 are

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.020 
negative 7 negative 81 negative 1 are
all<00:01:52.049> really<00:01:52.380> good<00:01:52.470> examples<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.310> then<00:01:53.700> again

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
all really good examples and then again

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.280 
all really good examples and then again
I<00:01:54.360> can<00:01:54.869> write<00:01:55.049> a<00:01:55.079> fraction<00:01:56.060> like<00:01:57.060> negative<00:01:57.570> 14

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
I can write a fraction like negative 14

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.200 
I can write a fraction like negative 14
over<00:01:58.770> 2<00:01:59.460> as<00:01:59.909> long<00:02:00.780> as<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:01.110> simplifies<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:02.340> be<00:02:02.939> a

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
over 2 as long as it simplifies to be a

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.440 
over 2 as long as it simplifies to be a
positive<00:02:04.110> or<00:02:05.009> negative<00:02:05.070> whole<00:02:05.700> number<00:02:06.060> so<00:02:06.240> in

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
positive or negative whole number so in

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.430 
positive or negative whole number so in
this<00:02:06.570> case<00:02:06.750> negative<00:02:07.049> 7<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:09.110> in<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.200> last

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
this case negative 7 and in the last

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.670 
this case negative 7 and in the last
classification<00:02:11.340> is<00:02:12.140> rational<00:02:13.140> numbers

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
classification is rational numbers

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.470 
classification is rational numbers
and<00:02:13.829> again<00:02:14.400> rational<00:02:14.849> numbers<00:02:15.150> are<00:02:15.299> fractions

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
and again rational numbers are fractions

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.770 
and again rational numbers are fractions
decimals<00:02:15.840> and<00:02:16.170> percents<00:02:16.709> and<00:02:16.859> that<00:02:17.310> includes

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
decimals and percents and that includes

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.050 
decimals and percents and that includes
repeating<00:02:18.780> decimals<00:02:19.230> so<00:02:19.560> I<00:02:19.590> can<00:02:19.920> make<00:02:20.099> fifty

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
repeating decimals so I can make fifty

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.569 
repeating decimals so I can make fifty
six<00:02:21.299> hundredths<00:02:21.989> a<00:02:22.200> repeating<00:02:23.069> decimal<00:02:23.099> by

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:23.579 
six hundredths a repeating decimal by

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:26.690 
six hundredths a repeating decimal by
adding<00:02:23.939> that<00:02:24.200> bar<00:02:25.200> notation<00:02:25.769> over<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.159> six<00:02:26.430> or

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
adding that bar notation over the six or

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.699 
adding that bar notation over the six or
the<00:02:26.790> repeater<00:02:27.150> bar<00:02:27.480> and<00:02:27.930> that<00:02:28.230> would<00:02:28.409> tell<00:02:28.590> me

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
the repeater bar and that would tell me

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.649 
the repeater bar and that would tell me
six<00:02:29.010> repeats<00:02:29.370> on<00:02:29.609> and<00:02:29.790> on<00:02:29.849> and<00:02:30.000> on<00:02:30.090> forever<00:02:30.329> so

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:30.659 
six repeats on and on and on forever so

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:33.379 
six repeats on and on and on forever so
I<00:02:30.719> can<00:02:30.930> predict<00:02:31.230> a<00:02:31.290> pattern<00:02:31.670> another<00:02:32.670> example

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:33.389 
I can predict a pattern another example

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:36.309 
I can predict a pattern another example
would<00:02:33.840> be<00:02:33.900> something<00:02:34.260> like<00:02:34.670> one-third<00:02:35.670> and

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
would be something like one-third and

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.190 
would be something like one-third and
again<00:02:37.319> one-third<00:02:38.099> repeats<00:02:38.609> forever<00:02:39.239> but<00:02:40.049> we

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
again one-third repeats forever but we

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.990 
again one-third repeats forever but we
know<00:02:40.349> the<00:02:40.500> pattern<00:02:40.680> three<00:02:41.459> will<00:02:41.760> repeat

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
know the pattern three will repeat

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.699 
know the pattern three will repeat
forever<00:02:43.069> another<00:02:44.069> example<00:02:44.519> we<00:02:44.609> could<00:02:44.760> use

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
forever another example we could use

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:50.899 
forever another example we could use
negative<00:02:47.569> seven<00:02:48.569> eighths<00:02:49.519> because<00:02:50.519> it<00:02:50.700> can<00:02:50.819> be

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:50.909 
negative seven eighths because it can be

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:53.780 
negative seven eighths because it can be
negative<00:02:51.090> or<00:02:51.480> positive<00:02:52.220> so<00:02:53.220> we<00:02:53.340> can<00:02:53.489> make<00:02:53.639> it

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
negative or positive so we can make it

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.110 
negative or positive so we can make it
negative<00:02:54.000> seven<00:02:54.629> eighths<00:02:54.900> and<00:02:55.819> then<00:02:56.819> the<00:02:56.939> last

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
negative seven eighths and then the last

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.839 
negative seven eighths and then the last
one<00:02:57.419> I<00:02:57.450> want<00:02:57.720> to<00:02:57.780> give<00:02:58.319> you<00:02:58.530> is<00:02:58.799> 1/5

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
one I want to give you is 1/5

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:04.819 
one I want to give you is 1/5
it's<00:03:00.840> a<00:03:00.959> terminating<00:03:02.269> decimal<00:03:03.349> 1/5<00:03:04.349> would<00:03:04.650> be

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:04.829 
it's a terminating decimal 1/5 would be

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:07.940 
it's a terminating decimal 1/5 would be
20<00:03:05.459> hundredths<00:03:06.180> so<00:03:07.019> it<00:03:07.169> can<00:03:07.290> be<00:03:07.379> terminating

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
20 hundredths so it can be terminating

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.009 
20 hundredths so it can be terminating
or<00:03:08.069> repeating<00:03:08.760> when<00:03:09.180> you're<00:03:09.359> putting<00:03:09.689> it<00:03:09.810> in

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
or repeating when you're putting it in

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.500 
or repeating when you're putting it in
the<00:03:10.409> category<00:03:10.769> of<00:03:11.129> rational<00:03:11.609> numbers<00:03:12.209> and

the category of rational numbers and

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.270 
the category of rational numbers and
then<00:03:12.750> we<00:03:12.870> have<00:03:13.049> down<00:03:13.230> here<00:03:13.260> negative<00:03:13.889> two<00:03:14.159> and

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
then we have down here negative two and

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.750 
then we have down here negative two and
three<00:03:14.489> tenths<00:03:14.700> and<00:03:15.389> we<00:03:15.629> also<00:03:15.840> have<00:03:16.109> a<00:03:16.139> percent

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
three tenths and we also have a percent

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.899 
three tenths and we also have a percent
125<00:03:17.760> percent<00:03:18.269> as<00:03:18.449> a<00:03:18.479> rational<00:03:19.109> number<00:03:19.760> so<00:03:20.760> as

125 percent as a rational number so as
you<00:03:21.090> can<00:03:21.209> see<00:03:21.769> when<00:03:22.769> you're<00:03:22.889> classifying

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
you can see when you're classifying

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.140 
you can see when you're classifying

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
that whole numbers and integers are all

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:40.009 
that whole numbers and integers are all
considered<00:03:38.370> rational<00:03:38.609> numbers<00:03:39.269> that's<00:03:39.810> why

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
considered rational numbers that's why

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.559 
considered rational numbers that's why
rational<00:03:40.500> numbers<00:03:40.739> is<00:03:40.859> on<00:03:40.979> the<00:03:41.069> outside<00:03:41.569> and

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
rational numbers is on the outside and

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:44.059 
rational numbers is on the outside and
whole<00:03:42.750> numbers<00:03:43.049> is<00:03:43.169> on<00:03:43.290> the<00:03:43.379> inside<00:03:43.500> because

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
whole numbers is on the inside because

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:45.920 
whole numbers is on the inside because
rational<00:03:44.489> numbers<00:03:44.819> some<00:03:45.150> of<00:03:45.269> those<00:03:45.389> fractions

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
rational numbers some of those fractions

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.659 
rational numbers some of those fractions
decimals<00:03:46.049> and<00:03:46.349> percents<00:03:46.889> are<00:03:47.040> not<00:03:47.400> whole

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:47.669 
decimals and percents are not whole

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:49.309 
decimals and percents are not whole
numbers<00:03:48.030> that's<00:03:48.299> why<00:03:48.479> I<00:03:48.509> whole<00:03:48.810> numbers<00:03:49.139> is

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
numbers that's why I whole numbers is

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:51.050 
numbers that's why I whole numbers is
not<00:03:49.470> the<00:03:49.590> biggest<00:03:49.949> that's<00:03:50.370> why<00:03:50.549> rational

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
not the biggest that's why rational

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.729 
not the biggest that's why rational
