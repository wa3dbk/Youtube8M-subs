for<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.420> graphics<00:00:39.809> I<00:00:40.020> have<00:00:40.649> it<00:00:40.739> so<00:00:40.860> that<00:00:41.010> just

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
for the graphics I have it so that just

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.740 
for the graphics I have it so that just
tapping<00:00:41.670> on<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.969> screen<00:00:42.210> for<00:00:42.420> now<00:00:42.570> just

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
tapping on the screen for now just

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.970 
tapping on the screen for now just
chooses<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.710> default<00:00:44.070> setting<00:00:48.890> it's<00:00:49.890> the

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
chooses the default setting it's the

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.939 
chooses the default setting it's the
same<00:00:50.190> as<00:00:50.309> hitting<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.610> enter<00:00:50.730> key<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:54.739> had<00:00:55.739> so

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
same as hitting the enter key I had so

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.459 
same as hitting the enter key I had so
hit<00:00:56.100> in<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.280> corner<00:00:56.610> just<00:00:56.989> kind<00:00:57.989> of<00:00:58.020> skips<00:00:58.320> all

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
hit in the corner just kind of skips all

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.069 
hit in the corner just kind of skips all
this<00:00:58.649> stuff<00:00:59.329> so<00:01:00.329> various<00:01:00.660> parts<00:01:00.930> of<00:01:00.960> the

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
this stuff so various parts of the

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.189 
this stuff so various parts of the
screen<00:01:01.289> do<00:01:01.440> different<00:01:01.739> things<00:01:02.870> so<00:01:03.870> hitting

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
screen do different things so hitting

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.920

part of the screen is for lasers this
upper<00:01:18.869> part<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.229> screen<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:19.770> for<00:01:20.549> firing

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
upper part of the screen is for firing

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.039 
upper part of the screen is for firing
missiles<00:01:21.890> sometimes<00:01:22.890> if<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.100> need<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.369> barrel

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
missiles sometimes if you need to barrel

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:26.090 
missiles sometimes if you need to barrel
sometimes<00:01:25.049> not<00:01:25.229> used<00:01:25.470> very<00:01:25.530> often<00:01:25.830> in<00:01:26.009> the

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
sometimes not used very often in the

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.819 
sometimes not used very often in the
game<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:27.000> corners<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.570> screen<00:01:27.869> the

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
game the corners of the screen the

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.890 
game the corners of the screen the
important<00:01:29.220> part<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.850> accelerometers<00:01:30.689> of

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
important part is the accelerometers of

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.069 
important part is the accelerometers of
the<00:01:30.990> iPad<00:01:31.380> are<00:01:31.829> used<00:01:32.189> for<00:01:32.630> changing<00:01:33.630> angle<00:01:33.990> at

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
the iPad are used for changing angle at

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.410 
the iPad are used for changing angle at
your<00:01:34.200> ships<00:01:34.439> facing<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.220> depending<00:01:36.210> on<00:01:36.299> how

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
your ships facing and depending on how

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.200 
your ships facing and depending on how
much<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:36.900> tilt<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:37.590> it's<00:01:38.430> faster<00:01:38.939> or<00:01:39.060> slower

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
much you tilt it it's faster or slower

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.630 
much you tilt it it's faster or slower
so<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:39.689> can<00:01:39.869> turn<00:01:40.049> slowly<00:01:40.380> or<00:01:40.799> more<00:01:40.860> quickly

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
so I can turn slowly or more quickly

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.179 
so I can turn slowly or more quickly
same<00:01:42.570> thing<00:01:42.780> with<00:01:42.960> looking<00:01:43.259> up<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.619> down<00:01:44.630> and

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
same thing with looking up and down and

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:49.609 
same thing with looking up and down and
then<00:01:47.189> you<00:01:47.220> can<00:01:47.659> over<00:01:48.659> here<00:01:48.869> is<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.110> only<00:01:49.229> part

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
then you can over here is the only part

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:50.929 
then you can over here is the only part
of<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.890> on-screen<00:01:50.310> controls<00:01:50.610> that<00:01:50.850> I'm

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
of the on-screen controls that I'm

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.760 
of the on-screen controls that I'm
explicitly<00:01:51.479> drawing<00:01:51.960> for<00:01:52.229> now<00:01:52.350> just<00:01:52.500> because

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
explicitly drawing for now just because

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.859 
explicitly drawing for now just because
it's<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.130> more<00:01:53.280> complex<00:01:53.790> this<00:01:54.390> is<00:01:54.540> for<00:01:54.689> moving

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
it's the more complex this is for moving

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.480 
it's the more complex this is for moving
forward<00:01:55.700> backward<00:01:57.560> you<00:01:58.560> can<00:01:58.740> slide<00:01:59.070> right

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
forward backward you can slide right

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.359 
forward backward you can slide right
slide<00:02:00.000> left<00:02:00.990> or<00:02:01.439> if<00:02:01.890> you<00:02:01.979> hit<00:02:02.070> one<00:02:02.219> of<00:02:02.250> the

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
slide left or if you hit one of the

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.889 
slide left or if you hit one of the
diagonals<00:02:02.759> it<00:02:02.909> will<00:02:03.000> combine<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.360> couple<00:02:03.509> of

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
diagonals it will combine a couple of

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.839 
diagonals it will combine a couple of
the<00:02:04.020> moves<00:02:05.689> also<00:02:06.689> you<00:02:07.560> can<00:02:07.710> slide<00:02:07.979> up<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.670> down

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
the moves also you can slide up and down

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.010 
the moves also you can slide up and down
which<00:02:09.179> I'm<00:02:09.300> not<00:02:09.390> showing<00:02:09.599> but<00:02:09.810> it's<00:02:09.929> just

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
which I'm not showing but it's just

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.839 
which I'm not showing but it's just
above

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849

it's<00:02:17.209> uh<00:02:17.859> let's<00:02:18.859> go<00:02:19.040> find<00:02:19.430> some<00:02:19.909> bad<00:02:20.150> guys<00:02:20.420> and

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:20.629 
it's uh let's go find some bad guys and

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:33.539 
it's uh let's go find some bad guys and
kill<00:02:20.870> them<00:02:21.079> here

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:46.280 

I<00:02:33.579> can<00:02:34.120> rescue<00:02:34.420> some<00:02:34.599> hostages

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.550 

takes<00:02:46.830> a<00:02:46.950> little<00:02:47.099> getting<00:02:47.220> used<00:02:47.760> to<00:02:47.849> but<00:02:48.560> then

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
takes a little getting used to but then

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:55.309 
takes a little getting used to but then
it<00:02:49.650> starts<00:02:49.920> to<00:02:49.950> feel<00:02:50.269> intuitive<00:02:54.319> you

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
it starts to feel intuitive you

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.440 
it starts to feel intuitive you
definitely<00:02:55.800> use<00:02:55.950> some<00:02:55.980> refining<00:02:56.580> but<00:02:57.030> not<00:02:57.239> bad

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
definitely use some refining but not bad

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:06.160 
definitely use some refining but not bad
for<00:02:58.430> purposes<00:02:59.430> of<00:02:59.489> a<00:02:59.640> demo<00:03:04.069> there's<00:03:05.069> still

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
for purposes of a demo there's still

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.600 
for purposes of a demo there's still
some<00:03:07.170> bugs<00:03:07.440> in<00:03:07.680> my<00:03:07.830> rendering<00:03:08.220> I<00:03:08.430> haven't

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
some bugs in my rendering I haven't

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.160 
some bugs in my rendering I haven't
fixed<00:03:08.819> those<00:03:09.120> but<00:03:09.360> this<00:03:09.480> is<00:03:09.660> the<00:03:09.780> software

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
fixed those but this is the software

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.630 
fixed those but this is the software
renderer<00:03:10.500> so<00:03:10.680> it's<00:03:10.800> not<00:03:10.920> worth<00:03:11.130> it

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
renderer so it's not worth it

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.850 
renderer so it's not worth it
3d<00:03:12.060> hardware<00:03:12.450> rendering<00:03:12.599> will<00:03:12.989> change

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
3d hardware rendering will change

00:03:13.860 --> 00:04:04.460 
3d hardware rendering will change
everything

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.740 

okay<00:04:05.740> I<00:04:05.770> think<00:04:06.580> they<00:04:06.700> game<00:04:06.910> crash<00:04:07.300> there's

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
okay I think they game crash there's

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.570 
okay I think they game crash there's
still<00:04:07.990> some<00:04:08.200> crash<00:04:08.440> bugs<00:04:08.740> in<00:04:08.950> this<00:04:09.069> but<00:04:09.400> that

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 
still some crash bugs in this but that

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.190 
still some crash bugs in this but that
gives<00:04:09.700> you<00:04:09.850> the<00:04:09.970> general<00:04:10.180> idea<00:04:10.720> of<00:04:10.780> how<00:04:11.020> this

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
gives you the general idea of how this

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.199 
gives you the general idea of how this
would<00:04:11.410> work<00:04:11.440> potentially<00:04:12.400> on<00:04:12.490> the<00:04:12.550> iPad<00:04:12.970> and

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
would work potentially on the iPad and

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:15.660 
would work potentially on the iPad and
also<00:04:13.510> the<00:04:13.630> iPhone<00:04:14.020> version<00:04:14.310> same<00:04:15.310> code<00:04:15.520> we

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
also the iPhone version same code we

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.190 
also the iPhone version same code we
should<00:04:15.819> run<00:04:15.970> on<00:04:16.090> both<00:04:16.239> platforms<00:04:17.070> thank<00:04:18.070> you
