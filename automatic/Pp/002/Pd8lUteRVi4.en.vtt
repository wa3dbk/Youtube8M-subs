00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.629
 first thing we're going to do is we're going to 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:37.660
 put in 300 grams of meat for 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:40.150
 sow or it can also be I think skirt 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.130
 I 'm going to cook it in a 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:45.970
 Pressure cooker 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:49.270
 once the valve has been lifted and 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.750
 start making noise 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.390
 I do not know what this is 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.910
 let's start counting time well 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:01.890
 what good and good girls already here 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:05.070
 they spent the 30 minutes in depression and 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.810
 I'm going to take out the carnita, I know that 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.800
 see very little but they will see that a 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.180
 once it's broken it's going to be a good 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.520
 quantity for what we want then 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.890
 well let's let it cool and 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.530
 then we are going to plant him later 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.280
 let's put fire to our pan 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.649
 where are we going to have a kilo and a half of 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.140
 green tomato but if you want 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:30.720
 make the red sauce can use the 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.149
 same amount of good what I'm going to 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.420
 to do is that the same broth that you use 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:36.640
 for 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.439
 for what is the meat or the broth that 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.650
 came out of the flesh is going to be with what 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:44.619
 I'm going to boil the tomato because I want 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:47.610
 really the sauce has impregnated well 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:50.110
 well what is the taste of the meat 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.440
 so then I'll put everything to you 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.090
 completely cover the spicy tomato 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.600
 it's like I do not like that this is 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:01.390
 so spicy nothing I will add 10 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.370
 chilies like I'm using these 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.250
 are this what 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:08.560
 Serrano chile, well, I'm going to 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.630
 leave so we are going to cover it so that 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.720
 start to boil and once there is already 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.430
 boiled and the tomato has changed color 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.820
 it's going to be time to let it cool down 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:21.400
 little bit and then I went ahead with the 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:24.370
 shredding the meat here is and how 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:28.750
 can see are auctioned tita and also 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:31.000
 finely chop an onion remember from 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.890
 that good at least to chop the 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.770
 onion has to be fine finally 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.920
 because I do not think they go to please 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:41.590
 the taste or the sensation of a great 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.050
 piece of onion so have a lot 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.700
 careful to finally chop the 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.820
 onion to make it much easier 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.590
 taste it and do not know that I have here 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.350
 what is the tomato now we are going to 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.680
 liquefy it but we are going to add what 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:03:00.070
 it's an onion room we're also going 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:03.070
 to add a clove of garlic and we're going to 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:05.020
 add a pinch of cumin what to 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.940
 reach is to grab with your three fingers 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.430
 that's what you have to put cake 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:14.360
 today we are going to put here and we are going to 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:16.220
 Blend everything and sautÃ© the sauce 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.790
 As you can see, I'm with a 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.470
 pretty good consistency 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.260
 from here nothing else I'm going to add a 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.360
 spoonful of nur switzerland and I'll let that 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.700
 give a boil and is more than ready not to 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:32.020
 let's add salt because remember that 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:34.310
 the broth of the meat already has salt 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.200
 then do not add much more because 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.710
 they will be left alone we will do is 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:42.740
 well first let's put it to warm 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:46.060
 quite a bit 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:48.640
 well good hot ok 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:54.730
 let's take a little oil in 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:56.530
 a kitchen napkin and what the 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.200
 mind 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:04.950
 my son malito and this is going to help me 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:07.760
 that is chalupitas not going to stick 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:10.430
 and also removed the excess 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.310
 and we're going to leave it there right now girls 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.319
 let's do what are the chalupitas 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:17.690
 and for this we are going to visit a little bag 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:19.699
 and we're going from here to half 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.340
 this is optional as these girls 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:23.960
 you can command them to do nothing 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.370
 more I will do this procedure for 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.110
 that you can see that also 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.660
 you can do it if you are 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.940
 they encourage me to do them in very few 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.940
 I have almost always done them 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.860
 the regular ordered them to do but good 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.720
 I will show you how you can 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.840
 do and so you leave them to the size 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:44.570
 of your taste in what you want and 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.889
 well I do not have to do this for 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.080
 make tortillas or anything like that 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:49.760
 things and then I will teach them with 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.440
 two tablets how can they do it up 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.130
 with a small plate they can do it 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.780
 big 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.850
 necessarily size that we're going to 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.520
 use girls to take the portion of 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:00.320
 the mass is going to be this one 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.780
 small teaspoon of these that are 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.330
 to sweeten the coffee then good 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:07.039
 let's take the idea is a little bit of 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:10.160
 well what I'm going to do that I'm going to do 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:12.590
 I will leave this movement as well as 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:15.729
 how to lengthen and is 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:20.540
 and this ends as well as 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:23.370
 like nothing or almost something like that 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:26.070
 I put it here 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:29.060
 I plug it and then I'm going to take this one and I'm going 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.060
 to pressure 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:36.480
 is that thing that is used to make 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:39.410
 the perfect tortillas kids live 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.410
 I am already 

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:43.770
 mitch to lupita then good now what 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:45.729
 what I'm going to do is that I'm going to 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:49.599
 my coma 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:52.419
 are perfect and our chalupitas 

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:55.210
 how good we continue with our recipe and 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:57.909
 well I wanted to show you the size of 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:00.699
 ax lupita girls see is a little thing 

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:02.559
 yes yes it is very small and I am 

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:04.689
 comparing with a normal tortilla for 

00:06:02.559 --> 00:06:07.509
 that can see but hey this is the 

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:09.699
 original size of the chalupas in fact 

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:12.400
 These sloops are nothing made 

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:16.150
 calculate the term of it this add 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:18.279
 a little bit of butter that in fact if 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:20.169
 you go back to the butter the truth 

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:23.919
 that fat social so you 're not going to see very 

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:26.740
 good but if you do not like or prefer 

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:29.830
 use some other type of oil can 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:33.419
 name it I'm going to put the 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:33.419
 Chalupitas that I have left here 

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:39.040
 first by the back sometimes 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:41.100
 that are already impregnated of what is the 

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:44.440
 But I'm going to give it back because 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:48.030
 I need that where the sauce will go 

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.030
 bend a little 

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:54.739
 and again on the other side I'm going to leave 

00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:56.989
 as much as it is again adored that they remain 

00:06:54.739 --> 00:06:59.479
 also again crispy because it's the 

00:06:56.989 --> 00:07:01.909
 most important feature of this 

00:06:59.479 --> 00:07:04.129
 that have to be crispy not 

00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:06.139
 well then let's Aguaditas 

00:07:04.129 --> 00:07:08.869
 leave them a little there that they brown 

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:11.419
 little more the tortilla and I like it 

00:07:08.869 --> 00:07:13.189
 let it last a little longer the 

00:07:11.419 --> 00:07:15.619
 tortilla and then add the sauce 

00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:17.989
 because if I add at this moment the 

00:07:15.619 --> 00:07:20.929
 salsa and the tortilla is going to soften and 

00:07:17.989 --> 00:07:22.699
 will not get to get brown as I do what 

00:07:20.929 --> 00:07:27.039
 I'm going to do is I'm going to add the 

00:07:22.699 --> 00:07:27.039
 salsita to each one 

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:36.449
 let's add a little bit of what the 

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.449
 shredded meat 

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.889
 and finally we are going to add a little 

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:45.819
 of onion 

00:07:41.889 --> 00:07:47.740
 the amount that you are as well as 

00:07:45.819 --> 00:07:50.199
 we have finished the saucer of the day of 

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:52.629
 today I hope you like this rich craving 

00:07:50.199 --> 00:07:55.710
 so well we are seeing ourselves in a 

00:07:52.629 --> 00:07:55.710
 next video
