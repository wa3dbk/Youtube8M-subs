00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:04.939
 the lan 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.309
 the people is that anna and video of today is the 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.929
 rappa of the books that he in the marathon 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.240
 Who does not know I did it? 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.580
 only I did not put video and I followed the 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.689
 of the demand for levels that 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.210
 he was a very intelligent person 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.160
 doing so because he speaks as soon as the 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.140
 time he would spend making the video 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.480
 edited and published on youtube he could 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.489
 Are you reading and I found the most 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.840
 intelligent in the world so I was not going to 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.969
 make a call not because I do not 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.649
 I'm cheap but I did because of him. 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.510
 then thank the church 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.950
 I have a glue because I do not 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:46.140
 I remember what I noticed here will kill me 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.940
 was to choose seven books to read in 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.620
 seven days so I had chosen one 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.199
 book with pictures I got you have a 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.520
 the next workshop 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.379
 They started to begin and end a 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.600
 Only series I had no series 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.850
 to start and finish having 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.949
 Only from the books so I took it was 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.840
 warm hour I only read because it will launch 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.270
 film notes how this 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.040
 story and such I found I do not know what 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.530
 from this book there is still a book 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.780
 red on the cover lost for now that 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.850
 I read ours do not say anything, right? 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.439
 remember someone chose for you I 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.090
 I picked up and concluded that I sent 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.490
 The mousy choose for me and chose 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.439
 this is the genre that, at least in this 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.090
 I got an eye for an eye that is a genre 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.280
 that I've never seen in life 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.189
 beyond fiction the book that turned movie 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.350
 I got water for elephants in 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.640
 book computation so I even got it 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.380
 I I must say that I spoke 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:42.810
 miserably are not exactly 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:46.229
 so but it is I read without any order I 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.170
 I just caught reading the books then mixed 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.689
 and bus books that I could not 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.820
 read were these two I was tossa 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.729
 I was very sad when I did not read more 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.350
 Look, do you think to me if I do not remember that? 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:03.060

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:05.640
 remembered you know that it is worth the vacancy only sat 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.439
 Then I said 'I can not read if because 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.840
 after all have to remember what happens 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.580

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.069

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:51.700

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.400

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:01.090
 400 in one that was pole on the third day 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:04.060

 around 624 pages or so 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:30.160
 I thought it would be 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.139

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.510
