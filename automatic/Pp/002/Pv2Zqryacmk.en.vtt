00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.559 
opinion on all this and this is like bra
like<00:02:32.920> I<00:02:33.040> started<00:02:33.310> a<00:02:33.340> bra<00:02:33.870> yo<00:02:34.980> this<00:02:35.980> is<00:02:36.040> so<00:02:36.879> high

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
like I started a bra yo this is so high

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.559 
like I started a bra yo this is so high
I<00:02:37.870> cannot<00:02:38.470> wait<00:02:38.890> for<00:02:39.190> this<00:02:39.310> and<00:02:39.640> I<00:02:40.180> can't<00:02:40.450> wait

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
I cannot wait for this and I can't wait

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:41.910 
I cannot wait for this and I can't wait
to<00:02:40.599> see<00:02:40.870> what<00:02:41.049> they<00:02:41.200> do<00:02:41.260> because<00:02:41.620> I<00:02:41.860> think

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
to see what they do because I think

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:42.960 
to see what they do because I think
they're<00:02:42.159> going<00:02:42.280> to<00:02:42.340> add<00:02:42.489> a<00:02:42.519> little<00:02:42.760> bit<00:02:42.909> of

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
they're going to add a little bit of

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.809 
they're going to add a little bit of
balancing<00:02:43.599> I<00:02:43.750> think<00:02:44.140> the<00:02:44.230> game<00:02:44.440> is<00:02:44.819> somewhat

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
balancing I think the game is somewhat

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:47.039 
balancing I think the game is somewhat
balanced<00:02:46.209> there's<00:02:46.360> some<00:02:46.510> things<00:02:46.690> they<00:02:46.810> can<00:02:46.959> do

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
balanced there's some things they can do

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:48.690 
balanced there's some things they can do
here<00:02:47.319> and<00:02:47.470> there<00:02:47.620> but<00:02:47.829> the<00:02:48.160> game<00:02:48.310> for<00:02:48.489> the<00:02:48.519> most

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
here and there but the game for the most

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.490 
here and there but the game for the most
part<00:02:48.879> is<00:02:49.030> pretty<00:02:49.329> good<00:02:49.599> they<00:02:49.780> nerfed<00:02:50.140> the<00:02:50.319> heck

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
part is pretty good they nerfed the heck

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.710 
part is pretty good they nerfed the heck
out<00:02:50.650> of<00:02:50.680> diddy<00:02:50.920> kong<00:02:51.129> the<00:02:51.370> nerve<00:02:51.700> chic<00:02:52.150> they

out of diddy kong the nerve chic they
nerfed<00:02:53.200> a<00:02:53.349> lot<00:02:53.560> of<00:02:53.680> characters<00:02:54.010> that<00:02:54.129> were<00:02:54.280> so

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:06.159 
forward smash combos and stuff so I'm

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:08.520 
forward smash combos and stuff so I'm
really<00:03:06.760> really<00:03:07.209> excited<00:03:07.390> about<00:03:07.840> this<00:03:08.079> update

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
really really excited about this update

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.839

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 
I'm really excited to see what they do

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:11.610 
I'm really excited to see what they do
if<00:03:10.209> there<00:03:10.359> is<00:03:10.540> any<00:03:10.780> balancing<00:03:11.170> which<00:03:11.290> I<00:03:11.379> think

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
if there is any balancing which I think

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.440 
if there is any balancing which I think
there<00:03:11.799> will<00:03:11.950> be<00:03:12.010> and<00:03:12.700> the<00:03:12.819> tournament<00:03:13.209> mode<00:03:13.299> is

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
there will be and the tournament mode is

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.990 
there will be and the tournament mode is
just<00:03:13.629> like<00:03:13.810> the<00:03:14.109> cherry<00:03:14.829> on<00:03:14.980> top<00:03:15.220> of<00:03:15.400> the<00:03:15.489> icing

platform to wear it just migrates from

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:03.960 
platform to wear it just migrates from

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
from system to system or from place to

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.030 
from system to system or from place to
place<00:04:04.000> so<00:04:04.389> what<00:04:04.660> I<00:04:04.690> mean<00:04:04.930> is<00:04:05.049> like<00:04:05.199> if<00:04:05.680> Nintendo

place so what I mean is like if Nintendo

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.369 
place so what I mean is like if Nintendo
would<00:04:06.160> say<00:04:06.400> hey<00:04:06.549> super<00:04:06.910> smash<00:04:07.120> bros<00:04:07.389> ultimate

we<00:04:43.450> never<00:04:43.660> got<00:04:43.840> it<00:04:44.020> and<00:04:44.170> we<00:04:44.260> finally<00:04:44.830> got<00:04:44.950> a

platform that can deliver and I think

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.000
