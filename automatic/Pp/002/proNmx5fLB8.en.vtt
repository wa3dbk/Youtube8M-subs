multi man version you're gonna want to

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.759 
multi man version you're gonna want to
use<00:00:20.250> for<00:00:21.000> or<00:00:21.090> for<00:00:21.300> point<00:00:21.570> X<00:00:21.810> custom<00:00:22.560> firmware

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
use for or for point X custom firmware

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:14.090 
multi-man to be honest with you it's
just<00:04:10.050> a<00:04:10.350> different<00:04:10.650> kind<00:04:10.920> of<00:04:11.130> code<00:04:11.780> so<00:04:13.100> there

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
just a different kind of code so there

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.940 
just a different kind of code so there
we<00:04:14.190> go<00:04:14.220> that's<00:04:14.670> installed<00:04:15.090> his<00:04:15.510> circle<00:04:15.950> wait

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
we go that's installed his circle wait

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:22.310 
we go that's installed his circle wait
for<00:04:17.130> the<00:04:17.220> system<00:04:17.519> to<00:04:17.549> respond<00:04:19.669> and<00:04:20.959> it<00:04:21.959> should

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
for the system to respond and it should

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:28.159 
for the system to respond and it should
be<00:04:24.020> right<00:04:25.020> there<00:04:25.320> and<00:04:26.210> multi-man<00:04:27.210> SingStar<00:04:27.840> by

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 
be right there and multi-man SingStar by

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:34.720 
be right there and multi-man SingStar by
arc<00:04:28.440> so<00:04:28.890> press<00:04:29.790> X<00:04:30.419> on<00:04:30.660> that<00:04:31.040> and<00:04:32.040> load<00:04:32.730> it<00:04:32.880> up

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:34.730 
arc so press X on that and load it up

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:38.240 
arc so press X on that and load it up
now<00:04:35.730> this<00:04:35.970> is<00:04:36.030> a<00:04:36.260> backup<00:04:37.260> manager<00:04:37.500> same

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
now this is a backup manager same

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.810 
now this is a backup manager same
principle<00:04:38.700> as<00:04:38.940> multiband<00:04:39.780> but<00:04:40.680> this<00:04:41.580> is<00:04:41.729> the

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
principle as multiband but this is the

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.030 
principle as multiband but this is the
stealth<00:04:42.060> version<00:04:42.479> so<00:04:42.750> Sony<00:04:43.320> can<00:04:43.500> pick<00:04:43.680> it<00:04:43.770> up

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
stealth version so Sony can pick it up

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:52.180 
stealth version so Sony can pick it up
