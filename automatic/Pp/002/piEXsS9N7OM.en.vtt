pop-up<00:00:34.680> like<00:00:34.829> this<00:00:35.130> it's<00:00:35.430> for<00:00:36.180> explore<00:00:36.600> by

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
pop-up like this it's for explore by

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.660 
pop-up like this it's for explore by
touch<00:00:36.840> which<00:00:37.380> is<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.530> secondary<00:00:38.070> feature<00:00:38.280> to

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
touch which is a secondary feature to

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.740 
touch which is a secondary feature to
talkback<00:00:39.469> what<00:00:40.469> that<00:00:40.649> one<00:00:40.800> does<00:00:41.070> is<00:00:41.750> that

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
talkback what that one does is that

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.950 
talkback what that one does is that
instead<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:43.730> reciting<00:00:44.730> actions<00:00:45.329> you<00:00:45.450> perform

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
instead of reciting actions you perform

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.700 
instead of reciting actions you perform
it'll<00:00:46.739> just<00:00:46.980> speak<00:00:47.250> on<00:00:47.600> any<00:00:48.600> icons<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:49.260> tap<00:00:49.500> on

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
it'll just speak on any icons you tap on

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.639 
it'll just speak on any icons you tap on
before<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.399> action<00:00:50.670> is<00:00:50.820> performed<00:00:50.969> so<00:00:51.649> it's

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
before the action is performed so it's

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.910 
before the action is performed so it's
kind<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:52.860> like<00:00:53.010> preliminary<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:54.120> talkback

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
kind of like preliminary to talkback

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.650 
kind of like preliminary to talkback
once<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:56.039> enable<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:57.000> can<00:00:57.149> press<00:00:57.300> ok<00:00:57.449> and

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
once you enable it you can press ok and

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.900 
once you enable it you can press ok and
explore<00:00:58.559> by<00:00:58.710> touch<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:59.070> actually<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.430> culprit

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
explore by touch is actually the culprit

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.720 
explore by touch is actually the culprit
for<00:01:00.090> some<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.050> issues<00:01:01.379> that<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.579> can

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
for some of the issues that that can

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.640 
for some of the issues that that can
happen<00:01:02.969> so<00:01:03.149> I'll<00:01:03.390> press<00:01:03.660> ok<00:01:06.260> ok<00:01:07.260> I'm<00:01:07.350> pressing

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
happen so I'll press ok ok I'm pressing

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.130 
happen so I'll press ok ok I'm pressing
ok<00:01:07.770> this<00:01:08.340> enables<00:01:08.939> explore<00:01:09.479> by<00:01:09.630> touch<00:01:09.689> as<00:01:09.960> well

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
ok this enables explore by touch as well

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.380 
ok this enables explore by touch as well
you<00:01:10.770> can't<00:01:11.010> see<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.250> here<00:01:11.310> but<00:01:11.760> it's<00:01:12.000> it's<00:01:12.240> on

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
anything actually so what you have to do

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.780 
anything actually so what you have to do
is<00:01:36.060> just<00:01:36.240> swipe<00:01:36.509> with<00:01:36.990> two<00:01:37.140> fingers<00:01:40.520> ok<00:01:41.520> and

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
is just swipe with two fingers ok and

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:42.920 
is just swipe with two fingers ok and
when<00:01:41.909> it<00:01:42.000> stops<00:01:42.210> talking<00:01:42.390> all<00:01:42.659> right<00:01:42.780> and

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
when it stops talking all right and

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.149 
when it stops talking all right and
that's<00:01:43.530> because<00:01:43.799> of<00:01:43.920> explore<00:01:44.280> by<00:01:44.460> touch<00:01:45.950> so<00:01:46.950> on

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159
