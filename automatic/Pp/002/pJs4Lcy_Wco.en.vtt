hello ladies and gentlemen ghosts here
and<00:00:06.550> today<00:00:06.790> I'm<00:00:07.000> bringing<00:00:07.420> you<00:00:07.690> another<00:00:07.870> short

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:08.380 
and today I'm bringing you another short

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.379 
and today I'm bringing you another short
jet<00:00:08.710> tutorial<00:00:09.280> this<00:00:09.760> time<00:00:10.030> we're<00:00:10.150> going<00:00:10.240> to<00:00:10.299> be

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:10.389 
jet tutorial this time we're going to be

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:12.120 
jet tutorial this time we're going to be
taking<00:00:10.660> a<00:00:10.719> look<00:00:10.840> at<00:00:10.900> how<00:00:11.320> you<00:00:11.379> can<00:00:11.769> land<00:00:11.980> your

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:12.130 
taking a look at how you can land your

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:14.400 
taking a look at how you can land your
jet<00:00:12.550> I<00:00:12.790> figured<00:00:13.599> this<00:00:13.660> would<00:00:13.809> be<00:00:13.929> a<00:00:13.960> good<00:00:14.170> time

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:14.410 
jet I figured this would be a good time

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.280 
jet I figured this would be a good time
to<00:00:14.440> do<00:00:14.650> it<00:00:14.679> because<00:00:15.340> the<00:00:15.490> September<00:00:16.059> patch

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:16.290 
to do it because the September patch

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.780 
to do it because the September patch
containing<00:00:17.290> all<00:00:17.470> of<00:00:17.500> the<00:00:17.680> CTE<00:00:18.070> changes<00:00:18.580> will

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:18.790 
containing all of the CTE changes will

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:20.640 
containing all of the CTE changes will
soon<00:00:19.090> be<00:00:19.270> coming<00:00:19.420> out<00:00:19.689> and<00:00:20.110> one<00:00:20.320> of<00:00:20.410> those<00:00:20.470> big

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:20.650 
soon be coming out and one of those big

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.979 
soon be coming out and one of those big
changes<00:00:20.980> that<00:00:21.310> I'm<00:00:21.460> expecting<00:00:22.029> is<00:00:22.270> of<00:00:22.810> course

00:00:22.979 --> 00:00:22.989 
changes that I'm expecting is of course

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:24.479 
changes that I'm expecting is of course
classic<00:00:23.410> mode<00:00:23.590> that<00:00:23.770> I<00:00:23.800> went<00:00:24.070> over<00:00:24.189> in<00:00:24.430> a

00:00:24.479 --> 00:00:24.489 
classic mode that I went over in a

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:26.460 
classic mode that I went over in a
previous<00:00:24.910> video<00:00:25.149> so<00:00:25.360> if<00:00:25.810> you'd<00:00:25.960> like<00:00:25.989> to<00:00:26.140> check

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:26.470 
previous video so if you'd like to check

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:27.780 
previous video so if you'd like to check
that<00:00:26.649> out<00:00:26.739> you<00:00:26.950> can<00:00:26.980> click<00:00:27.369> on<00:00:27.520> the<00:00:27.640> annotation

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:27.790 
that out you can click on the annotation

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.970 
that out you can click on the annotation
now<00:00:28.329> to<00:00:28.960> learn<00:00:29.140> what<00:00:29.290> classic<00:00:29.619> mode<00:00:29.739> is<00:00:29.890> about

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:29.980 
now to learn what classic mode is about

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.069 
now to learn what classic mode is about
but<00:00:30.640> essentially<00:00:31.149> one<00:00:31.509> of<00:00:31.540> the<00:00:31.660> main<00:00:31.809> things

00:00:32.069 --> 00:00:32.079 
but essentially one of the main things

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:34.920 
but essentially one of the main things
it<00:00:32.259> involves<00:00:32.680> is<00:00:32.800> no<00:00:33.130> vehicle<00:00:33.700> repairs<00:00:34.090> so<00:00:34.690> if

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:34.930 
it involves is no vehicle repairs so if

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.779 
it involves is no vehicle repairs so if
you're<00:00:35.079> a<00:00:35.140> jet<00:00:35.380> pilot<00:00:35.590> and<00:00:35.890> myself<00:00:36.219> you're

00:00:36.779 --> 00:00:36.789 
you're a jet pilot and myself you're

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:38.729 
you're a jet pilot and myself you're
going<00:00:36.969> to<00:00:37.059> need<00:00:37.179> to<00:00:37.300> learn<00:00:37.449> the<00:00:37.629> jet<00:00:37.840> repair<00:00:38.559> it

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:38.739 
going to need to learn the jet repair it

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:41.430 
going to need to learn the jet repair it
and<00:00:38.859> then<00:00:39.219> get<00:00:39.429> back<00:00:39.670> up<00:00:39.820> in<00:00:40.030> the<00:00:40.149> sky<00:00:40.440> alright

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
and then get back up in the sky alright

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.660 
and then get back up in the sky alright
so<00:00:41.589> we're<00:00:41.679> going<00:00:41.769> to<00:00:41.859> be<00:00:41.920> going<00:00:42.129> over<00:00:42.250> a<00:00:42.399> few

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
so we're going to be going over a few

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.250 
so we're going to be going over a few
different<00:00:42.879> effective<00:00:43.449> tactics<00:00:43.960> that<00:00:44.050> you<00:00:44.170> can

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
different effective tactics that you can

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.590 
different effective tactics that you can
use<00:00:44.440> here<00:00:44.920> the<00:00:45.309> first<00:00:45.550> one<00:00:45.760> is<00:00:45.969> just<00:00:46.000> to<00:00:46.179> find<00:00:46.449> a

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
use here the first one is just to find a

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.079 
use here the first one is just to find a
large<00:00:46.870> open<00:00:47.350> area<00:00:47.710> of<00:00:47.890> land<00:00:48.129> now<00:00:48.699> of<00:00:48.820> course<00:00:48.910> it

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:49.089 
large open area of land now of course it

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:50.819 
large open area of land now of course it
doesn't<00:00:49.210> have<00:00:49.420> to<00:00:49.629> be<00:00:49.780> in<00:00:50.109> the<00:00:50.289> bounds<00:00:50.679> of

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 
doesn't have to be in the bounds of

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:52.200 
doesn't have to be in the bounds of
where<00:00:51.070> you<00:00:51.190> play<00:00:51.399> as<00:00:51.460> infantry<00:00:52.030> because

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
where you play as infantry because

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.489 
where you play as infantry because
you're<00:00:52.480> only<00:00:52.629> going<00:00:52.780> to<00:00:52.870> be<00:00:52.929> getting<00:00:53.109> out<00:00:53.320> for

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:53.499 
you're only going to be getting out for

00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:55.739 
you're only going to be getting out for
a<00:00:53.769> few<00:00:53.949> seconds<00:00:54.399> and<00:00:54.489> repairing<00:00:55.030> if<00:00:55.149> the<00:00:55.539> timer

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:55.749 
a few seconds and repairing if the timer

00:00:55.749 --> 00:00:57.509 
a few seconds and repairing if the timer
isn't<00:00:55.960> long<00:00:56.230> enough<00:00:56.469> you<00:00:56.679> can<00:00:56.710> just<00:00:56.980> jump<00:00:57.190> back

00:00:57.509 --> 00:00:57.519 
isn't long enough you can just jump back

00:00:57.519 --> 00:00:59.700 
isn't long enough you can just jump back
in<00:00:57.670> your<00:00:57.820> jet<00:00:58.059> and<00:00:58.210> then<00:00:58.570> out<00:00:58.749> again<00:00:58.989> to<00:00:59.350> reset

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
in your jet and then out again to reset

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.439 
in your jet and then out again to reset
the<00:00:59.800> timer<00:01:00.010> to<00:01:00.249> give<00:01:00.370> you<00:01:00.429> enough<00:01:00.699> time<00:01:00.940> to

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:01.449 
the timer to give you enough time to

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:03.809 
the timer to give you enough time to
actually<00:01:01.629> fully<00:01:02.170> repair<00:01:02.649> that<00:01:02.829> yet<00:01:03.039> so<00:01:03.699> the

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:03.819 
actually fully repair that yet so the

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:05.160 
actually fully repair that yet so the
first<00:01:04.059> thing<00:01:04.269> you<00:01:04.360> have<00:01:04.449> to<00:01:04.600> understand<00:01:05.019> about

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
first thing you have to understand about

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.710 
first thing you have to understand about
jets<00:01:05.680> in<00:01:05.860> battlefield<00:01:06.400> 4<00:01:06.670> is<00:01:06.850> that<00:01:07.390> once<00:01:07.570> you

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
jets in battlefield 4 is that once you

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.450 
jets in battlefield 4 is that once you
get<00:01:07.899> close<00:01:08.200> enough<00:01:08.350> to<00:01:08.500> the<00:01:08.649> ground<00:01:08.920> your

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
get close enough to the ground your

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.160 
get close enough to the ground your
London<00:01:09.729> gear<00:01:10.119> will<00:01:10.270> automatically<00:01:10.990> engage

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
London gear will automatically engage

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.710 
London gear will automatically engage
and<00:01:11.740> your<00:01:11.979> jet<00:01:12.220> will<00:01:12.369> slow<00:01:12.640> down<00:01:12.720> but

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
and your jet will slow down but

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:14.940 
and your jet will slow down but
basically<00:01:14.079> you're<00:01:14.320> going<00:01:14.470> to<00:01:14.560> want<00:01:14.770> to

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
basically you're going to want to

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.770 
basically you're going to want to
obviously<00:01:15.250> aim<00:01:15.610> your<00:01:15.759> nose<00:01:15.820> down<00:01:16.240> start<00:01:16.689> to

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
obviously aim your nose down start to

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.810 
obviously aim your nose down start to
decelerate<00:01:17.140> and<00:01:17.500> you<00:01:18.130> really<00:01:18.399> kind<00:01:18.670> of<00:01:18.700> have

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
decelerate and you really kind of have

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.310 
decelerate and you really kind of have
to<00:01:18.969> stick<00:01:19.180> it<00:01:19.240> to<00:01:19.390> the<00:01:19.570> ground<00:01:19.810> you<00:01:20.020> don't<00:01:20.200> want

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
to stick it to the ground you don't want

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.499 
to stick it to the ground you don't want
to<00:01:20.380> nosedive<00:01:20.920> in<00:01:21.130> there<00:01:21.340> but<00:01:21.939> you<00:01:22.030> have<00:01:22.210> to<00:01:22.390> be

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:22.509 
to nosedive in there but you have to be

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:24.600 
to nosedive in there but you have to be
pretty<00:01:22.750> vicious<00:01:22.990> you'll<00:01:23.469> notice<00:01:23.799> that<00:01:24.040> you

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
pretty vicious you'll notice that you

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.330 
pretty vicious you'll notice that you
come<00:01:24.820> to<00:01:24.850> a<00:01:25.000> stop<00:01:25.119> very<00:01:25.570> abruptly<00:01:26.469> it's<00:01:26.770> not

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
come to a stop very abruptly it's not

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.670 
come to a stop very abruptly it's not
much<00:01:27.700> akin<00:01:28.149> to<00:01:28.659> the<00:01:28.750> physics<00:01:29.079> in<00:01:29.200> real<00:01:29.409> life

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
much akin to the physics in real life

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.319 
much akin to the physics in real life
whatsoever<00:01:30.369> where<00:01:30.610> you<00:01:30.670> need<00:01:30.909> an<00:01:31.060> entire

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:31.329 
whatsoever where you need an entire

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:33.450 
whatsoever where you need an entire
runway<00:01:31.780> to<00:01:31.840> stop<00:01:32.200> a<00:01:32.229> jet<00:01:32.500> so<00:01:32.950> you<00:01:33.009> know<00:01:33.219> don't

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
runway to stop a jet so you know don't

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.170 
runway to stop a jet so you know don't
be<00:01:33.490> too<00:01:33.670> timid

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
be too timid

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.240 
be too timid
I<00:01:34.210> really<00:01:34.659> recommend<00:01:35.079> going<00:01:35.409> into<00:01:35.770> empty

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
I really recommend going into empty

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:37.859 
I really recommend going into empty
server<00:01:36.460> and<00:01:36.789> just<00:01:36.850> practicing<00:01:37.509> this<00:01:37.659> by

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869

a<00:01:40.060> bit<00:01:40.180> of<00:01:40.270> a<00:01:40.329> knack<00:01:40.539> a<00:01:40.750> lot<00:01:41.140> of<00:01:41.229> people<00:01:41.469> can't

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
a bit of a knack a lot of people can't

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:42.779 
a bit of a knack a lot of people can't
do<00:01:41.799> it<00:01:41.920> and<00:01:42.009> they<00:01:42.070> just<00:01:42.100> crash<00:01:42.460> into<00:01:42.640> the

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:42.789 
do it and they just crash into the

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:44.609 
do it and they just crash into the
ground<00:01:42.909> or<00:01:43.509> they<00:01:43.689> sort<00:01:43.930> of<00:01:44.049> skim<00:01:44.289> along<00:01:44.409> the

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:46.719 
ground slow down and use the end up

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:48.630 
ground slow down and use the end up
getting<00:01:46.990> taken<00:01:47.229> out<00:01:47.500> by<00:01:47.649> the<00:01:47.710> enemy<00:01:48.009> jet<00:01:48.250> pilot

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
getting taken out by the enemy jet pilot

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.429 
getting taken out by the enemy jet pilot
now<00:01:49.479> you<00:01:49.539> are<00:01:49.780> going<00:01:49.930> to<00:01:50.020> need<00:01:50.140> to<00:01:50.259> use<00:01:50.289> a

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:50.439 
now you are going to need to use a

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:51.959 
now you are going to need to use a
number<00:01:50.799> of<00:01:50.950> different<00:01:51.280> techniques<00:01:51.549> however

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:51.969 
number of different techniques however

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:53.459 
number of different techniques however
because<00:01:52.450> you're<00:01:52.630> not<00:01:52.719> always<00:01:52.930> going<00:01:53.229> to<00:01:53.320> have

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:53.469 
because you're not always going to have

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:56.249 
because you're not always going to have
a<00:01:53.530> very<00:01:53.740> large<00:01:54.039> piece<00:01:54.340> of<00:01:54.490> land<00:01:54.759> to<00:01:55.030> land<00:01:55.689> on<00:01:55.899> so

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
a very large piece of land to land on so

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:58.170 
a very large piece of land to land on so
for<00:01:56.500> example<00:01:56.829> here<00:01:57.100> we<00:01:57.130> land<00:01:57.579> on<00:01:57.759> the<00:01:57.789> radar

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
for example here we land on the radar

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.910 
for example here we land on the radar
dish<00:01:58.390> and<00:01:58.600> this<00:01:58.960> is<00:01:59.109> actually<00:01:59.380> a<00:01:59.409> really<00:01:59.649> good

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
dish and this is actually a really good

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.099 
dish and this is actually a really good
spot<00:02:00.280> may<00:02:00.789> not<00:02:00.939> be<00:02:01.030> the<00:02:01.119> best<00:02:01.299> spot<00:02:01.570> for<00:02:01.600> taking

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:02.109 
spot may not be the best spot for taking

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:03.240 
spot may not be the best spot for taking
damage<00:02:02.289> because<00:02:02.710> there<00:02:02.920> may<00:02:03.100> be<00:02:03.130> some

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
damage because there may be some

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.669 
damage because there may be some
engineers<00:02:04.090> walking<00:02:04.479> around<00:02:04.719> then<00:02:04.869> there<00:02:05.049> but

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:05.679 
engineers walking around then there but

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:07.200 
engineers walking around then there but
because<00:02:05.859> of<00:02:06.039> the<00:02:06.130> curvature<00:02:06.369> of<00:02:06.729> the<00:02:06.969> dish

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
because of the curvature of the dish

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.270 
because of the curvature of the dish
you're<00:02:07.810> actually<00:02:08.170> able<00:02:08.289> to<00:02:08.410> lund<00:02:08.740> it<00:02:08.950> and<00:02:09.130> then

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
you're actually able to lund it and then

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.859 
you're actually able to lund it and then
you<00:02:09.399> just<00:02:09.610> simply<00:02:09.759> wait<00:02:10.119> for<00:02:10.330> your<00:02:10.450> jet<00:02:10.690> to

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
you just simply wait for your jet to

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.750 
you just simply wait for your jet to
roll<00:02:11.080> backwards<00:02:11.620> and<00:02:11.860> then<00:02:12.400> start

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
roll backwards and then start

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.490 
roll backwards and then start
accelerating<00:02:13.090> forwards<00:02:13.840> wants<00:02:14.290> you

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
accelerating forwards wants you

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.360 
accelerating forwards wants you
essentially<00:02:14.890> happen

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
essentially happen

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.399 
essentially happen
lund<00:02:15.549> in<00:02:15.760> front<00:02:16.030> of<00:02:16.180> you<00:02:16.330> to<00:02:16.810> take<00:02:17.049> off<00:02:17.260> without

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:17.409 
lund in front of you to take off without

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:19.890 
lund in front of you to take off without
crushing<00:02:17.769> into<00:02:18.129> the<00:02:18.220> edge<00:02:18.370> there<00:02:18.900> something

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
crushing into the edge there something

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.690 
crushing into the edge there something
else<00:02:20.019> you<00:02:20.170> can<00:02:20.349> do<00:02:20.530> here<00:02:20.739> we<00:02:20.980> are<00:02:21.010> on<00:02:21.250> paracel

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
else you can do here we are on paracel

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.369 
else you can do here we are on paracel
storm<00:02:21.730> as<00:02:22.209> you<00:02:22.330> might<00:02:22.480> imagine<00:02:22.599> not<00:02:23.110> a<00:02:23.140> lot<00:02:23.349> of

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:23.379 
storm as you might imagine not a lot of

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:25.170 
storm as you might imagine not a lot of
area<00:02:23.739> to<00:02:23.769> lanyard<00:02:24.159> yet<00:02:24.400> but<00:02:24.879> you<00:02:24.970> can<00:02:25.090> do

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
area to lanyard yet but you can do

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.759 
area to lanyard yet but you can do
something<00:02:25.390> called<00:02:25.540> bouncing<00:02:26.230> which<00:02:26.500> is

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
something called bouncing which is

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:28.410 
something called bouncing which is
essentially<00:02:27.190> where<00:02:27.430> you<00:02:27.519> get<00:02:27.760> down<00:02:27.970> close<00:02:28.390> to

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
essentially where you get down close to

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.170 
essentially where you get down close to
some<00:02:29.019> of<00:02:29.110> the<00:02:29.230> Lund<00:02:29.470> to<00:02:30.040> engage<00:02:30.489> your<00:02:30.790> landing

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
some of the Lund to engage your landing

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.630 
some of the Lund to engage your landing
gear<00:02:31.209> and<00:02:31.690> slow<00:02:32.079> down<00:02:32.319> your<00:02:32.500> jet<00:02:32.799> and<00:02:32.980> then<00:02:33.519> you

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
gear and slow down your jet and then you

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.789 
gear and slow down your jet and then you
sort<00:02:33.819> of<00:02:33.909> bounce<00:02:34.269> to<00:02:34.930> the<00:02:35.049> next<00:02:35.290> place<00:02:35.500> you<00:02:35.650> can

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
sort of bounce to the next place you can

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:37.440 
sort of bounce to the next place you can
lump<00:02:36.010> so<00:02:36.250> as<00:02:36.340> you<00:02:36.430> see<00:02:36.579> here<00:02:36.879> I'm<00:02:37.060> coming<00:02:37.239> in

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
lump so as you see here I'm coming in

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.059 
lump so as you see here I'm coming in
much<00:02:37.629> slower<00:02:37.930> my<00:02:38.110> London<00:02:38.470> gears<00:02:38.620> already<00:02:38.920> down

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
much slower my London gears already down

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.220 
much slower my London gears already down
so<00:02:39.340> I<00:02:39.670> can<00:02:39.940> just<00:02:40.090> sort<00:02:40.209> of<00:02:40.329> plunk<00:02:40.690> the<00:02:40.780> jet<00:02:40.989> down

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
so I can just sort of plunk the jet down

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.020 
so I can just sort of plunk the jet down
on<00:02:41.409> the<00:02:41.500> ground<00:02:41.769> there<00:02:42.010> and<00:02:42.159> I'm<00:02:42.730> not<00:02:42.819> going<00:02:42.940> to

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
on the ground there and I'm not going to

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.660 
on the ground there and I'm not going to
use<00:02:43.209> up<00:02:43.450> all<00:02:43.599> of<00:02:44.230> the<00:02:44.470> runway<00:02:44.829> of<00:02:45.069> the<00:02:45.129> actual

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
use up all of the runway of the actual

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.460 
use up all of the runway of the actual
island<00:02:46.060> so<00:02:46.150> I'm<00:02:46.239> still<00:02:46.510> gonna<00:02:46.690> have<00:02:46.840> room<00:02:47.079> here

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
island so I'm still gonna have room here

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.380 
island so I'm still gonna have room here
after<00:02:48.129> a<00:02:48.160> long<00:02:48.400> day<00:02:48.579> to<00:02:48.700> actually<00:02:48.819> take<00:02:49.209> off

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
after a long day to actually take off

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.890 
after a long day to actually take off
again<00:02:50.700> now<00:02:51.700> as<00:02:51.879> I'm<00:02:52.030> sure<00:02:52.239> you<00:02:52.390> all<00:02:52.540> know<00:02:52.750> the

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
again now as I'm sure you all know the

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.619 
again now as I'm sure you all know the
f-35s<00:02:53.650> have<00:02:54.010> a<00:02:54.220> hover<00:02:54.579> mode<00:02:54.819> and<00:02:55.090> if<00:02:55.540> you're

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:55.629 
f-35s have a hover mode and if you're

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:57.509 
f-35s have a hover mode and if you're
not<00:02:55.750> sure<00:02:55.930> how<00:02:56.109> to<00:02:56.140> use<00:02:56.290> this<00:02:56.620> as<00:02:56.859> a<00:02:56.920> video<00:02:57.250> here

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
not sure how to use this as a video here

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.430 
not sure how to use this as a video here
that<00:02:57.549> I<00:02:57.700> made<00:02:57.940> some<00:02:58.359> time<00:02:58.540> ago<00:02:58.780> explaining

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
that I made some time ago explaining

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.899 
that I made some time ago explaining
that<00:02:59.590> so<00:02:59.829> you<00:02:59.890> can<00:03:00.069> go<00:03:00.190> and<00:03:00.400> check<00:03:00.700> that<00:03:00.730> out

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:00.909 
that so you can go and check that out

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:03.300 
that so you can go and check that out
now<00:03:01.180> but<00:03:01.659> the<00:03:01.750> hover<00:03:01.900> mode<00:03:02.079> is<00:03:02.319> very<00:03:02.620> useful<00:03:03.069> on

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
now but the hover mode is very useful on

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:04.319 
now but the hover mode is very useful on
the<00:03:03.549> f-35

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:04.329 
the f-35

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:06.330 
the f-35
the<00:03:04.750> main<00:03:04.900> reason<00:03:05.230> being<00:03:05.440> that<00:03:05.739> you<00:03:06.190> can

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
the main reason being that you can

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.339 
the main reason being that you can
literally<00:03:06.670> land<00:03:06.940> anywhere<00:03:07.420> and<00:03:07.750> the<00:03:08.200> main

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
literally land anywhere and the main

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:09.750 
literally land anywhere and the main
problem<00:03:08.620> with<00:03:08.650> landing<00:03:09.069> is<00:03:09.190> not<00:03:09.310> a<00:03:09.340> landing

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
problem with landing is not a landing

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.000 
problem with landing is not a landing
itself<00:03:10.150> its<00:03:10.420> landing<00:03:10.959> and<00:03:11.200> having<00:03:11.799> enough

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
itself its landing and having enough

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.670

room<00:03:12.280> afterwards<00:03:12.730> to<00:03:13.000> take<00:03:13.180> off<00:03:13.420> but<00:03:13.959> in<00:03:14.109> f-35

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
room afterwards to take off but in f-35

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.649

as<00:03:14.920> you<00:03:15.040> can<00:03:15.190> see<00:03:15.400> that<00:03:15.909> is<00:03:16.030> not<00:03:16.209> a<00:03:16.239> problem<00:03:16.450> at

00:03:16.649 --> 00:03:16.659 
as you can see that is not a problem at

servers<00:03:31.780> and<00:03:32.019> just<00:03:32.650> practicing<00:03:33.160> it<00:03:33.280> there<00:03:33.489> it

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700
