00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:05.759
 to prepare the ideal salad 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:10.370
 the Caesar salad already said it can 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.370
 get to have 500 calories we want 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.380
 the exact 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:36.110
 Arugula Salad 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.059
 Jaime because a lot of people 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:05.840
 I die a lot of salt but the ideal portion of 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.680
 palmetto 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.680
 the median amount 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.060
 the old ones have too much starch 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.560
 that before 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.560
 it has to be something that is bad 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.310
 that what we have to eat 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:42.479
 mixed but suppose we do not have no 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.710
 we have pea can be double the 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.360
 position of this 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.580
 and if we do not have three wise men doing 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.750
 as a total sum contribution to the 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.010
 more calories 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.720
 the tomato is the middle group as well 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.119
 we can put a nice one in the middle 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.700
 of combat and avocado the raft the palpa 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:03.380
 the lack great food with food but 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:05.910
 but pure vegetable fat an average of 150 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.150
 both this consume it in quantities 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.150
 moderate 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.790
 If I had a knife 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.349
 and what makes us get fat many times 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.610
 is the subject of dressings 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:24.959
 moved away by the soon respect I would draw 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.190
 mayonnaise including light mayonnaise 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:32.090
 and I would use free lemon or vinegar or a 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.090
 droplet of a good do 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.540
 the Lord 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.060
 this has 120 calories 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.049
 then I am very moderately not 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.010
 all of moderation jaime nidal by 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.010
 example a teaspoon 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:58.010
 and when I speak of moderation in the 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.010
 oil sell spoke a few quotas 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:08.010
 then what we have of the oil must 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.380
 know that except the salt do not go the 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.569
 ideal is not to use salt let's say but to what 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:16.290
 better the lack habit can reach 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:19.060
 a crisis to the topic that I asked 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:22.269
 that I have a friend who 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:26.200
 it could be a dressing to not occupy that 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:26.200
 with liquid petrolatum 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:42.970
 feeding the people who are 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.970
 used to this type of dressings 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:55.420
 lemon a little vinegar the aceto 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:55.420
 balsamic fattening has some low level 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.700
 of mayonnaise too many others 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:07.849
 recommend replacing them with mustard 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:10.190
 the mustard has no fat has 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:12.739
 lower caloric intake but it can be a 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:16.450
 good sustainable alternative and also 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:16.450
 a spoonful and a quantity 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:31.310
 do not tell you but there is no problem 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:32.960
 that here does not have great caloric contribution 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.660
 onion not what I'll do a 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.190
 good because you do not have to abuse 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.389
 the aspects partner who is insaladita 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.639
 as for a lunch 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:46.449
 I believe that great and lack the strong 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:46.449
 turkey chicken protein 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:05:00.530
 this has 1,033 in sodium everything is a 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.850
 art but look enough for this with 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.199
 a marraqueta 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.199
 this has as much salt as a cookie
