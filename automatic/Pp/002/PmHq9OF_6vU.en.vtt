00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:11.809 
now actually my plan is to get at least
enough<00:04:10.590> harmonic<00:04:11.069> dust<00:04:11.340> to<00:04:11.489> upgrade<00:04:11.790> my

their<00:04:13.889> crystal<00:04:14.280> counterparts<00:04:14.849> and<00:04:15.000> i'll

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
their crystal counterparts and i'll

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.210 
their crystal counterparts and i'll
probably<00:04:15.510> end<00:04:15.780> up<00:04:16.049> AFK<00:04:16.530> in<00:04:16.590> here<00:04:16.799> for<00:04:16.979> a<00:04:17.010> lot

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
probably end up AFK in here for a lot

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.710 
probably end up AFK in here for a lot
longer<00:04:17.370> as<00:04:17.639> well<00:04:17.820> just<00:04:18.060> because<00:04:18.329> it<00:04:18.510> is

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
longer as well just because it is

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.659 
longer as well just because it is
incredibly<00:04:19.229> easy<00:04:19.320> to<00:04:19.530> AFK<00:04:19.919> and<00:04:20.280> i'll

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
incredibly easy to AFK and i'll

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.550 
incredibly easy to AFK and i'll
eventually<00:04:20.940> want<00:04:21.329> to<00:04:21.389> create<00:04:21.810> an<00:04:21.989> amulet<00:04:22.500> of
