00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 who promised to read four books and 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.830
 failed 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:10.500
 the drink of the times is one of the 35 years of 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.030
 my mother a great connoisseur of art 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.080
 of the post 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:19.050
 Vacation is over 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:21.359
 I had not seen sex or seen in July that 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.420
 Passed and now I'm recording in August 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.519
 Because it took a little delay I read the 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.189
 becky bloom headline and it was a great 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:37.410
 favorite of every series who knows me 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:40.860
 Do you know I'm a money-saving mother? 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.110
 because a bit of late but it's a 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.780
 Fun reading so the book tells 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.329
 practically on the dec knowing a 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.309
 sister that she did not know existed and 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.610
 a lot happens and her sister is 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:58.770
 very different from her so I would give three 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:02.640
 stars of five for the book the final 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:05.400
 the book was short and is kind or yesterday 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.580
 it's not so the end wins three 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.310
 stars and a half the next book is by 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.830
 that I should think like a man does not 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.500
 brought me a big deal because he is 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.720
 focused on a more adult audience to 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.030
 married people there are people who are tired 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.369
 more people who have already been betrayed and such 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.930
 have a super disturbed relationship is 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.610
 Of course it's always interesting you read 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.360
 a read yes take some more 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.950
 acknowledgments the two authors of the book 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.890
 practically tells the whole book about 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.229
 own experiences have been 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.390
 frustrated in the love life of her writing 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.310
 that's how it is and despite a little bit more 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.009
 by the side so all men do not 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.399
 Metal lends but they give enough 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.979
 Emphasis on care if there is value for you 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.320
 and in the end they give more emphasis 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.850
 for the part of finding a man who 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.700
 has respect and everything else 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.700
 the project has a little more than 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:04.770
 My hope when it's good but it's not 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.140
 Like us, it's nice to know it 's good. 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.300
 then for this book would give three 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.370
 stars of five 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.990
 then the last book I read was this 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.850
 on here 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:17.280
 James understands that he is the catcher in the 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.770
 rye field and this one I thought 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.870
 that I was going to suffer a little to read that I was going to 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.540
 be difficult I do not know what I found 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.230
 Quiet reading, I did not find it difficult. 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.780
 of reading 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.840
 Of course it's not a read then 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.030
 so it's fine for the most 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.530
 Young man I would not recommend I thought I 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.230
 I was going to get a little depressed getting a 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.050
 little like that shaken by history and 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.210
 Did not tell me anything, I got mean. 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.710
 even surprise because jazz and other 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.960
 people who read and got to 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.850
 down with this story and it is not one 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.730
 sad story or anything but the 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:53.280
 her character that is a boy the boy 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.170
 in high school is he is very negative 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.720
 so in all he does all that he 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.160
 He speaks very badly and I am just like that. 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.470
 I had a very nice experience that 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.420
 I thought it was cool and made me think 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:08.220
 a different way he became one of the 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:10.050
 My favorite is a boy with a 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.540
 with various psychological factors 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:15.360
 disturbed in his life, the book 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.720
 type passes in a few days is after 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.940
 he is the type that failed in school he 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.730
 decided to take a tour of new york 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.400
 a real story so you know despite 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.230
 his disapproval is very 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.340
 smart is going this book actually 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:35.190
 probable chaos killers and if I 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.050
 I'm not mistaken, so that's why 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.300
 It's kind of personal, I scared it. 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.010
 I recommend reading. 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.200

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.330
