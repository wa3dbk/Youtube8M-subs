00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.270
 hello to everyone today I will show you how to knit 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:11.370
 such a train we knit dresses 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:15.150
 I used a simple semi-column and here 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:18.440
 I just tied two flowers on each 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.440
 the edge of this belt 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:30.080
 for starters, I'll make a chain with 200 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.080
 air loops 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:51.449
 In these on the second loop 3 4 so further 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:55.960
 until I have only 200 loops 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:01:00.449
 when you type 250 another one 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:03.640
 swivel loop and knit semi-column 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:07.409
 pull the thread through the loop of the base and 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:12.090
 then through the loop on the hook and so 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.090
 continue to the end of the row 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:31.270
 to receive 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:38.920
 at the end of the row, make one turn 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:42.580
 loop and then enter the hook into the loop with 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:46.690
 the other side i mean i don't turn 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:55.110
 my work and just knitting in reverse 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:55.110
 the side is also a semi-column and so on to the end 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.040
 row 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:21.540
 we receive 100 lats for a flower 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:21.540
 make a chain of 5 air loops 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:40.730
 from nine hook into the very first loop 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.730
 make a final loop 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:57.230
 then knit a single crochet 2 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.230
 single crochet in each loop 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:21.130
 there just continue the column without 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.460
 nakida 1 column without nakida to this attack 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.460
 I 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:12.860
 there again make one final 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:12.860
 loop 2 air loops and turn 

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:23.000
 now again polabolik 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:31.039
 single crochet 2 air loops 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:43.729
 semi-column and so i will continue until 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:43.729
 the end of a circle a column without nakida 2 loops 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:56.060
 semi - column and repeat the column again 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:56.060
 nakida 2 loops 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:22.460
 now you only need to tie 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:26.570
 every flower to search every edge 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:30.220
 search and then your belts are ready and 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:30.220
 Thanks for attention
