00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:08.010
 shanti shanti rf backpack nova tour 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.450
 pulse 20 22 liters that's it did not 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.040
 purposefully full hour 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.440
 zip around 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:19.470
 just so if this case I was loading 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.779
 launched of course much lower on strongly 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.449
 below I will probably not 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.300
 because here there is spins the belt 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.970
 luxury train is very similar to that train 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.949
 which i use in music 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.590
 once stayed here at a discount stepped not 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.190
 he bought a soft but that's like a man 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.110
 futsal 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.260
 I feel like I am sitting for this and let's 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.940
 take a look and the matter is that 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.829
 particular back spin should 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.000
 motivate she is not trained for our 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.880
 players represents 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.280
 here is such a stretched constructions here 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:56.480
 There is a hard vastochka photo seen 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:58.220
 aluminum mesh mesh 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.140
 it is standard in principle for all 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.030
 manufacturers for 1 little bit she's here 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.270
 curved but it is not critical at all 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.950
 again, you need to take into account all the others there 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.440
 models on strange lots of money for 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.680
 they want her here not so basically 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:15.380
 cool like this here is the net 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.720
 structure it is not very soft in soft 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.940
 Well, on average, as if excess depreciation 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.320
 fundamentally does not give a new braid function 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.690
 performs moisture through it should 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:27.740
 quit in some amount herself 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:29.180
 the fabric is just enough Velcro causing 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.910
 sense of security drown everyone on 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.619
 let's fix some bolts 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:36.940
 let's see what there is in a backpack 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:40.100
 Well firstly here are side pockets fabric 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:43.070
 do not store the usual soak up here 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.330
 there is no such thing 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.970
 no additional way here 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.070
 is pulled down is not very good but in 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.280
 In principle, it works fine withdrawal 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.020
 also can not be it is here it is 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.060
 on the sides there is a compartment under 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.770
 Coca-cola some conditionally not 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.280
 ventilated will be shawls to listen 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.720
 for example this corner to side pockets 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.460
 not very big but in principle for 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.439
 cities and enough again what we 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.720
 very very very like this here 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:11.780
 Dobers outer pocket where you can crab 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.130
 do not know what to take rains like 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.470
 You can take for example or some 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.810
 little spare jersey or something over here 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.190
 drag there is also such a weight 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.510
 allows you to fix further 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.610
 some small volume 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.819
 rope fixing elements here 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:30.450
 especially not only the lower one 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.950
 under the mountain equipment conditionally something 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.970
 additional attach probably 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:38.549
 there is no sense in the volume of side screeds 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.110
 it is not such here in principle 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:41.670
 You can fit on the foam of course 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.470
 hang out a little and think that 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.319
 questioning like that foam and on here and 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:49.019
 at the bottom drag so basically 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:51.090
 you can tweak with this backpack 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:53.250
 the question is some small further 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.140
 top there is such a pocket ask it 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.909
 photographer will appreciate it and generally amateur and 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.069
 gentle technique he is very pleasant on 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:02.040
 the touch of the material that is not scratched 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.810
 so go here will not fit at all 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.430
 none but iphone naturally fit 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.720
 can be put on the premiere of the hood here 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.780
 some kind of nozzles on the wiki 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.790
 extra and let's see 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.260
 the main division in it is naturally skin 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.970
 a dead hare as always for Stryuk 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:22.319
 stone tour because it bothers us 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:25.730
 let's see how to regain could not 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:27.410
 obedient but that's how you walk 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.510
 stuffed 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.549
 material at all on say something not 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.569
 have time to ryuzaki to the limit because 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:36.959
 doesn't start to pop 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:38.849
 and after that in lightning diverge from 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.760
 unexpected moment 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:43.560
 nonetheless lightning ok how we 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.319
 cleaned all the stuff she ride well 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.840
 fittings here 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:52.400
 unknown manufacturer 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.840
 so the world will deliver what you need to say 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.760
 check out these shadows super hit our 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:00.200
 communicators what is the chance 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:05.629
 a tag somewhere on here but here in 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:07.220
 frame we will try vs novel for 

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:12.489
 hydrator but because the hydrator is here 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:15.140
 also provided here she was drunk 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:16.699
 the place still remains that is such here 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.709
 backpack pull 

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:20.709
 highly recommended shopping at all 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.550
 all classic black with 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.800
 the emperor can walk with her and 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.270
 small exit and tough enough 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.830
 back well ventilated for summer 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.590
 and on such volumes this spin is not 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.479
 interferes there if 40 50 liters I chose 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.460
 already working back then here she is on the plane 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:38.290
 shanti shanti RF article on huskies 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.290
