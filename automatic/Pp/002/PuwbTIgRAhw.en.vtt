00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 all health trunks at the microphone and Zog 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.859
 you are watching the next issue of insane 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.779
 experiences 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.519
 Today in the program classic bang 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.530
 bk and not applicable 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.150
 and no stupas this experience can even be 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.019
 apply Okay first things first 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.019
 go 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:25.539
 and so in the first experience according to good tradition 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:28.750
 we again decided to blow up bk 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:30.789
 and guess who tolerated correctly e100 well 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.680
 he's so cool when you blow him up 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.230
 bk true and we will check today 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.809
 the following is it possible to undermine bks by one 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.030
 projectile yes yes yes yes yes while you write in 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:42.430
 comments that the key can think a bit 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.800
 I am ready to surprise you by saying that 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.430
 how much would we try to shrink so 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.430
 and did not explode 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.780
 and here when we loaded one more into it 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.770
 the projectile and in the sum of them became two then 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.770
 began reconciliation 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.340
 avid constancy instead 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:26.119
 after the explosion of the 35 tower ammunition just 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.679
 burned out again and again and again whether 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.539
 stars in the sky so converged tula and 

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:32.899
 there really is some burnout relationship 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:34.850
 bk on the number of shells in the end if 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:37.250
 you want to make a cool fireworks 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:41.869
 tanks then load smaller shells and 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:44.000
 you will have a feast to garnish we 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:47.479
 we offer you to look interesting 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.429
 experiment about the stork and ammunition but here 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.259
 now everything will be different remember experience 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:53.000
 from the second issue where we stoked weave and 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:54.890
 set it on fire under the water so today 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.209
 we will try to drive and 100 under the water and 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.399
 blow up bk 

00:01:56.209 --> 00:02:00.619
 it became interesting to us how will it be 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.479
 lead the towers under water she will fly off or 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.880
 will remain in place and what will happen if 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.470
 turn on burnout for example first 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.140
 according to the rules of controlled blasting 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.700
 combat packs we are crit and we are on land 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.209
 further we send to the experimental 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.860
 deep sea swimming to the bottom 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.890
 pava makes a volley tank explodes well 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.769
 nothing happens the tower doesn't fly off 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.630
 burnout no smoke and no fire too 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:28.819
 try again but only the bet 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:31.130
 do the same thing with the lion and again 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:33.139
 nothing happened ie we conclude 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.299
 that with the explosion of bk under water no 

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:37.130
 the beauty of destruction you will not see only 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:46.310
 only an indicator of shells will indicate to you 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:47.180
 that you blew up ammunition that's it 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.950
 dessert time 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.200
 and let him not be like that today 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:55.010
 spectacular but then he can sometimes 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.150
 useful to you in battle, and so everyone knows 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.639
 maximum drawing options 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.989
 see the tanks but here are the exact data on 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:01.819
 volume at what maximum distance 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:04.130
 can fly projectile without losing 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:05.900
 there is no opinion that 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.880
 they say most of the guns in the game will affect 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.040
 700 720 meters and a few 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:14.060
 small-caliber and at all only 300 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:17.930
 350 we were not satisfied with such data and we 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.459
 decided to sort things out themselves collected 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.709
 training room launched 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.419
 robin and put a bunch of tanks on 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.430
 cliff near the mill and the arrow 

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:27.230
 put on the field in the center after 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.720
 numerous volleys and devastated 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.370
 ammunition we managed to calculate that 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.319
 visually projectile flies 700 mm 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:38.470
 however, the breaking distance at which he 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:38.470
 can still hit target 694 meters 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.880
 this result is valid for 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:56.040
 american t34 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.040
 on other tanks it may be different 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.530
 but now I hope you understand 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.299
 how much significant casco can be 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.400
 you on the mini card is not always of course 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:19.590
 will be breaking through the tablets but for sure 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:21.690
 sometimes it can even charge our fight 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.460
 today's release is coming to an end and i 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.620
 again remind you all dear viewers 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.570
 what if you want to participate in 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.220
 filming this show then in the description for 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.000
 This video has a link to our 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.070
 group vk 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.680
 where we will report on the recruitment of tankers 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.930
 and the exact date of the recording of the new issue and 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.940
 also if you have not mega cool 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.430
 idea for the experience then do not forget to share 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.470
 with her writing to us in the appropriate 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.840
 discussions in our group are the best ideas 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.300
 get into the release and their author will get one 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.560
 thousand gold to your account thanks 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.810
 everyone who took part in the shooting 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.850
 This video Well, we'll see you in 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:58.220
 following videos trunk good luck ah 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:58.220
