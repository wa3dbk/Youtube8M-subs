land<00:05:32.810> obviously<00:05:33.229> this<00:05:33.320> is<00:05:33.440> a<00:05:33.470> plug-in<00:05:33.710> that<00:05:33.919> we

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.010 
land obviously this is a plug-in that we

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:35.980 
land obviously this is a plug-in that we
can't<00:05:34.250> break<00:05:34.850> things<00:05:35.210> like<00:05:35.419> that<00:05:35.660> so<00:05:35.840> that

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
can't break things like that so that

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:37.719 
can't break things like that so that
that<00:05:36.290> is<00:05:36.500> one<00:05:36.800> of<00:05:36.890> the<00:05:36.950> plug-in<00:05:37.250> aspects<00:05:37.610> but

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:37.729 
that is one of the plug-in aspects but

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:38.830 
that is one of the plug-in aspects but
for<00:05:37.910> the<00:05:37.970> most<00:05:38.120> part<00:05:38.240> there's<00:05:38.570> not<00:05:38.660> going<00:05:38.780> to

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840 
for the most part there's not going to

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.290 
for the most part there's not going to
be<00:05:38.960> like<00:05:39.080> any<00:05:39.290> crazy<00:05:39.500> mods<00:05:39.890> or<00:05:40.400> particle

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:41.300

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:44.810 
happens after the first 30 days I guess

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:46.240

soon been a lag hopefully the lag gets
sorted<00:06:27.470> eventually<00:06:27.919> but<00:06:28.100> either<00:06:28.580> way<00:06:28.850> that

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:29.450 
sorted eventually but either way that

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:31.029 
sorted eventually but either way that
was<00:06:29.720> actually<00:06:30.080> the<00:06:30.169> main<00:06:30.320> announcement<00:06:30.770> for

00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:31.039 
was actually the main announcement for

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:32.860 
was actually the main announcement for
how<00:06:31.160> to<00:06:31.220> Minecraft<00:06:31.760> I<00:06:31.940> hope<00:06:32.450> you<00:06:32.570> guys<00:06:32.720> are

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:32.870 
how to Minecraft I hope you guys are

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:34.390 
how to Minecraft I hope you guys are
decided<00:06:33.350> for<00:06:33.500> it<00:06:33.560> as<00:06:33.650> I<00:06:33.740> am<00:06:33.890> I<00:06:34.010> feel<00:06:34.159> like<00:06:34.310> I'm

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:34.400 
decided for it as I am I feel like I'm

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:35.589 
decided for it as I am I feel like I'm
repeating<00:06:34.640> myself<00:06:34.789> at<00:06:35.120> this<00:06:35.210> point<00:06:35.300> so<00:06:35.570> I

00:06:35.589 --> 00:06:35.599 
repeating myself at this point so I

00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:38.170 
repeating myself at this point so I
think<00:06:35.659> when<00:06:35.870> I<00:06:35.900> wrap<00:06:36.140> things<00:06:36.409> up

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:38.180 
think when I wrap things up

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:39.489 
think when I wrap things up
that's<00:06:38.599> actually<00:06:38.900> an<00:06:38.960> extension<00:06:39.379> of<00:06:39.409> the

00:06:39.489 --> 00:06:39.499 
that's actually an extension of the
