porosity

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.270 
porosity

leavings like that you wouldn't want to

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.830 
leavings like that you wouldn't want to
rub<00:03:10.220> them<00:03:10.370> in<00:03:10.549> or<00:03:10.790> have<00:03:11.419> them<00:03:11.540> touch<00:03:11.689> your

scalp<00:03:12.049> this<00:03:12.260> is<00:03:12.470> a<00:03:12.500> good<00:03:13.269> water<00:03:14.269> basically

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
scalp this is a good water basically

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.500 
scalp this is a good water basically
then<00:03:14.959> to<00:03:15.169> use<00:03:15.819> so<00:03:17.500> usually<00:03:18.549> I'll<00:03:19.549> just<00:03:20.120> spray

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
then to use so usually I'll just spray

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.280 
then to use so usually I'll just spray
it<00:03:20.690> on<00:03:20.900> my<00:03:20.930> hair<00:03:22.209> when<00:03:23.209> I<00:03:23.239> took<00:03:23.329> down<00:03:23.690> this<00:03:24.019> set

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
it on my hair when I took down this set

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.229 
it on my hair when I took down this set
though<00:03:24.500> it<00:03:24.709> didn't<00:03:24.979> dry<00:03:25.250> completely<00:03:25.909> when<00:03:26.150> it

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
though it didn't dry completely when it

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.800 
though it didn't dry completely when it
took<00:03:26.359> it<00:03:26.449> down<00:03:26.659> so<00:03:27.409> it<00:03:28.220> will<00:03:28.909> probably<00:03:29.389> revert

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
took it down so it will probably revert

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.140 
took it down so it will probably revert
if<00:03:30.079> I<00:03:30.260> spray<00:03:30.560> too<00:03:30.620> much<00:03:30.949> water<00:03:31.190> so<00:03:31.970> what<00:03:32.090> I'm

if I spray too much water so what I'm
gonna<00:03:32.269> do<00:03:32.449> instead<00:03:32.599> is<00:03:32.870> just<00:03:33.229> spray<00:03:33.560> it<00:03:33.590> into

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:33.919 
gonna do instead is just spray it into

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:36.069 
gonna do instead is just spray it into
my<00:03:34.069> hand<00:03:34.430> and<00:03:34.639> then<00:03:34.879> scrunch<00:03:35.269> it<00:03:35.419> into<00:03:35.540> my<00:03:35.750> hair

started using my deep conditioner not a

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:39.369 
started using my deep conditioner not a
lot<00:06:36.559> this<00:06:36.770> actually<00:06:37.069> might<00:06:37.219> be<00:06:37.249> too<00:06:37.459> much<00:06:38.379> so

00:06:39.369 --> 00:06:39.379 
lot this actually might be too much so

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:43.179 
lot this actually might be too much so
use<00:06:40.189> a<00:06:40.249> little<00:06:40.459> bit<00:06:40.550> less<00:06:40.729> than<00:06:40.879> that<00:06:40.939> and<00:06:42.189> I

00:06:43.179 --> 00:06:43.189 
use a little bit less than that and I

00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:44.860 
use a little bit less than that and I
put<00:06:43.430> this<00:06:43.550> in<00:06:43.789> the<00:06:44.089> same<00:06:44.300> exact<00:06:44.569> way<00:06:44.599> I<00:06:44.749> did

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:51.550 
and you want to use a little bit at a

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.219 
and you want to use a little bit at a
time<00:06:51.729> you<00:06:51.880> can<00:06:51.910> always<00:06:52.270> add<00:06:52.479> more<00:06:52.509> if<00:06:52.780> you<00:06:52.930> need
