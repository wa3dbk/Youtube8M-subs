00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
up so it worked really well well i think

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.950 
up so it worked really well well i think
that's<00:00:50.340> actually<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.700> really<00:00:50.760> good<00:00:51.210> counter

the heavy Marines now he's loaded up and
we're<00:01:06.810> going<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.049> see<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.200> nice<00:01:07.409> drop<00:01:07.770> here<00:01:08.010> any

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
we're going to see a nice drop here any

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.310 
we're going to see a nice drop here any
moment<00:01:08.580> he<00:01:09.299> it's<00:01:09.420> gonna<00:01:09.570> be<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.869> two-pronged

moment he it's gonna be the two-pronged

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.289 
moment he it's gonna be the two-pronged
attack<00:01:10.439> once<00:01:11.040> again<00:01:11.430> he's<00:01:11.760> kind<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.030> heading

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
attack once again he's kind of heading

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.670 
attack once again he's kind of heading
back<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.510> probably<00:01:12.840> move<00:01:13.140> around<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.500> back

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
back and probably move around the back

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.700 
back and probably move around the back
of<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.950> base<00:01:14.240> you<00:01:15.240> know<00:01:15.360> Trellick<00:01:16.320> isn't<00:01:16.650> a

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
of the base you know Trellick isn't a

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.170 
of the base you know Trellick isn't a
very<00:01:16.799> vulnerable<00:01:17.070> position<00:01:17.430> he<00:01:17.939> probably

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
very vulnerable position he probably

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.929 
very vulnerable position he probably
thinks<00:01:18.570> that<00:01:18.960> s<00:01:19.350> gels<00:01:19.830> entire<00:01:20.220> army<00:01:20.670> is<00:01:20.759> here

he did just scan it will he have the

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.640 
he did just scan it will he have the
