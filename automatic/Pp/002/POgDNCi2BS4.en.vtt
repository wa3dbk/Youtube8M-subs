this<00:00:00.179> is<00:00:01.070> what<00:00:02.070> we<00:00:02.429> call<00:00:02.639> Titan<00:00:03.540> number<00:00:03.810> three

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
this is what we call Titan number three

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.380 
this is what we call Titan number three

botany greenhouse and it and three
others<00:00:11.190> that<00:00:11.460> we<00:00:11.580> have<00:00:11.790> here<00:00:12.059> all<00:00:12.570> came<00:00:12.929> from

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
others that we have here all came from

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.629 
others that we have here all came from
the<00:00:13.259> University<00:00:13.830> of<00:00:13.860> Wisconsin<00:00:14.400> up<00:00:14.519> at

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
the University of Wisconsin up at

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.670 
the University of Wisconsin up at
Madison<00:00:15.199> in<00:00:16.199> 2002<00:00:17.190> we<00:00:17.550> obtained<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:18.090> Miss<00:00:18.270> seed

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:18.680 
Madison in 2002 we obtained a Miss seed

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.859 
Madison in 2002 we obtained a Miss seed
and<00:00:19.680> so<00:00:19.949> we've<00:00:20.130> been<00:00:20.310> growing<00:00:20.520> them<00:00:20.699> on<00:00:20.910> and<00:00:21.240> we

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
and so we've been growing them on and we

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.620 
and so we've been growing them on and we
were<00:00:21.960> fortunate<00:00:22.439> enough<00:00:22.650> that<00:00:23.240> we<00:00:24.240> had<00:00:24.390> one

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
were fortunate enough that we had one

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.000 
were fortunate enough that we had one
bloom<00:00:24.960> in<00:00:25.230> May<00:00:25.830> I<00:00:26.189> was<00:00:27.119> tightened<00:00:27.420> number<00:00:27.630> one

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.010 
bloom in May I was tightened number one

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.589 
bloom in May I was tightened number one
Titan<00:00:29.010> number<00:00:29.279> two<00:00:29.429> is<00:00:29.910> lagging<00:00:30.510> a<00:00:30.539> little

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
Titan number two is lagging a little

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.749 
Titan number two is lagging a little
behind<00:00:30.779> but<00:00:31.710> Titan<00:00:32.189> number<00:00:32.399> three<00:00:32.610> here

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
behind but Titan number three here

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.090 
behind but Titan number three here
decided<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.410> go<00:00:34.410> ahead<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:34.680> produce<00:00:34.950> a

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
decided to go ahead and produce a

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.580 
decided to go ahead and produce a
inflorescence<00:00:35.969> for<00:00:36.149> us<00:00:36.270> so<00:00:36.570> hopefully<00:00:37.410> next

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
inflorescence for us so hopefully next

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.799 
inflorescence for us so hopefully next
couple<00:00:37.920> days<00:00:38.070> it<00:00:38.309> will<00:00:38.370> open<00:00:38.670> out<00:00:38.790> in<00:00:39.660> the

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
couple days it will open out in the

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.190 
couple days it will open out in the
time-lapse<00:00:40.850> you<00:00:41.850> can<00:00:42.000> see<00:00:42.210> Titan<00:00:42.719> number<00:00:42.989> twos

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
time-lapse you can see Titan number twos

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.639 
time-lapse you can see Titan number twos
and<00:00:43.590> in<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.789> front<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.420> then<00:00:45.899> tighten<00:00:46.440> number

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
and in the front and then tighten number

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.979 
and in the front and then tighten number
3s<00:00:46.890> in<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.100> background<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:47.940> it's<00:00:48.510> just<00:00:48.690> over

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
3s in the background and it's just over

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.920 
3s in the background and it's just over
two<00:00:49.649> or<00:00:49.800> three<00:00:50.010> days<00:00:50.039> four<00:00:50.610> days<00:00:50.640> showing<00:00:51.629> the

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
two or three days four days showing the

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.779 
two or three days four days showing the
growth<00:00:52.199> of<00:00:52.670> both<00:00:53.670> of<00:00:53.699> them<00:00:54.620> and<00:00:55.620> you<00:00:56.370> kind<00:00:56.699> of

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
growth of both of them and you kind of

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.470 
growth of both of them and you kind of
see<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.750> Titan<00:00:58.260> three<00:00:59.300> grows<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.329> little

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
see that Titan three grows a little

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.590 
see that Titan three grows a little
faster<00:01:01.050> than<00:01:01.230> two<00:01:01.440> so<00:01:02.010> choose<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.449> one

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
faster than two so choose the one

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.050 
faster than two so choose the one
closest<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.350> threes<00:01:05.159> in<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.369> back<00:01:05.640> at<00:01:05.939> the

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
closest and threes in the back at the

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.480 
closest and threes in the back at the
moment<00:01:06.260> what's<00:01:07.260> interesting<00:01:07.799> about<00:01:08.130> the

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
moment what's interesting about the

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.390 
moment what's interesting about the
titan<00:01:09.240> arum<00:01:09.390> Zork<00:01:09.810> or<00:01:10.140> they're<00:01:10.830> also<00:01:11.070> called

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
titan arum Zork or they're also called

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.020 
titan arum Zork or they're also called
the<00:01:11.549> corpse<00:01:12.090> flowers<00:01:12.860> one<00:01:13.860> thing<00:01:14.369> is<00:01:14.400> that

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
the corpse flowers one thing is that

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.420 
the corpse flowers one thing is that
they're<00:01:15.420> not<00:01:15.810> fairly<00:01:16.110> common<00:01:16.619> there<00:01:17.220> are

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
they're not fairly common there are

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.910 
they're not fairly common there are
indigenous<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.570> rainforests<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.470> Sumatra

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
indigenous to the rainforests of Sumatra

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.670 
indigenous to the rainforests of Sumatra
which<00:01:20.580> is<00:01:20.700> in<00:01:20.850> Indonesia<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.840> there's<00:01:22.470> just

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
which is in Indonesia and there's just

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.300 
which is in Indonesia and there's just
not<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:22.979> lot<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:24.590> probably<00:01:25.590> even<00:01:25.650> in<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.920> wild

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
not a lot of probably even in the wild

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.510 
not a lot of probably even in the wild
even<00:01:26.820> in<00:01:26.939> in<00:01:27.290> cultivated<00:01:28.310> places<00:01:29.310> like

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
even in in cultivated places like

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.359 
even in in cultivated places like
greenhouses<00:01:30.060> there's<00:01:30.450> very<00:01:30.780> few<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:31.140> them

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
greenhouses there's very few of them

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:34.399 
greenhouses there's very few of them
more<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.460> more<00:01:32.670> now<00:01:32.820> but<00:01:33.479> still<00:01:33.930> not<00:01:34.229> that

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
more and more now but still not that

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.039 
more and more now but still not that
many<00:01:34.619> so<00:01:34.890> it's<00:01:35.009> kind<00:01:35.250> of<00:01:35.299> rare<00:01:36.299> plant<00:01:36.600> on<00:01:36.840> that

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
many so it's kind of rare plant on that

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.170 
many so it's kind of rare plant on that
aspect<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.680> then<00:01:37.950> when<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.189> does<00:01:38.369> open<00:01:38.549> up<00:01:38.850> and

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
aspect and then when it does open up and

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.069 
aspect and then when it does open up and
bloom<00:01:39.540> fully<00:01:40.170> it<00:01:41.329> emits<00:01:42.329> an<00:01:42.540> odor<00:01:42.810> like

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
bloom fully it emits an odor like

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.130 
bloom fully it emits an odor like
rotting<00:01:43.979> flesh<00:01:44.009> or

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
rotting flesh or

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:54.270 
rotting flesh or
and<00:01:45.409> that's<00:01:46.130> to<00:01:46.400> attract<00:01:46.820> pollinators<00:01:47.720> to<00:01:48.260> it

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.890 

another<00:01:55.280> interesting<00:01:55.490> fact<00:01:56.000> about<00:01:56.180> it<00:01:56.450> it

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900 
another interesting fact about it it

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.050 
another interesting fact about it it
produces<00:01:57.440> the<00:01:57.619> largest<00:01:58.070> in<00:01:58.250> fluorescence<00:01:58.909> in

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
produces the largest in fluorescence in

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.180 
produces the largest in fluorescence in
the<00:01:59.150> world<00:01:59.330> and<00:01:59.600> then<00:02:00.170> inflorescences<00:02:00.920> many

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
the world and then inflorescences many

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.960 
the world and then inflorescences many
flowers<00:02:01.640> is<00:02:01.850> not<00:02:02.090> one<00:02:02.360> single<00:02:02.600> flower
