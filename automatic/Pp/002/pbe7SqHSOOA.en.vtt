that's your average mile per gallon so
when<00:06:15.199> you're<00:06:15.319> driving<00:06:15.909> it'll<00:06:16.909> actually<00:06:17.060> say

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:17.389 
when you're driving it'll actually say

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:18.760 
when you're driving it'll actually say
how<00:06:17.599> many<00:06:17.659> miles<00:06:18.050> per<00:06:18.169> gallon<00:06:18.440> you're

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:18.770 
how many miles per gallon you're

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.399 
how many miles per gallon you're
averaging<00:06:19.220> so<00:06:19.430> when<00:06:19.610> you're<00:06:19.759> revving<00:06:20.409> second

00:06:21.399 --> 00:06:21.409 
averaging so when you're revving second

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:23.890 
averaging so when you're revving second
gear<00:06:21.639> hundred<00:06:22.639> miles<00:06:22.789> an<00:06:22.940> hour<00:06:23.060> it'll<00:06:23.750> say

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:23.900 
gear hundred miles an hour it'll say

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.680 
gear hundred miles an hour it'll say
like<00:06:24.139> 12<00:06:24.860> miles<00:06:25.099> per<00:06:25.250> gallon<00:06:25.520> but<00:06:26.389> when<00:06:26.539> you're

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:26.690 
like 12 miles per gallon but when you're

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:29.260 
like 12 miles per gallon but when you're
cruising<00:06:27.139> fifth<00:06:27.409> gear<00:06:27.680> at<00:06:28.340> 70<00:06:28.880> miles<00:06:29.000> an<00:06:29.150> hour

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:29.270 
cruising fifth gear at 70 miles an hour

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:31.629 
cruising fifth gear at 70 miles an hour
it'll<00:06:29.569> say<00:06:29.750> 38<00:06:30.169> miles<00:06:30.470> a<00:06:30.620> gallon<00:06:30.650> or<00:06:30.979> 44<00:06:31.430> miles

00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:31.639 
it'll say 38 miles a gallon or 44 miles

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:33.850 
it'll say 38 miles a gallon or 44 miles
per<00:06:31.849> gallon<00:06:32.030> so<00:06:32.389> that'll<00:06:33.319> tell<00:06:33.500> you<00:06:33.590> how<00:06:33.710> much

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:33.860 
per gallon so that'll tell you how much

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:38.080 
per gallon so that'll tell you how much
cash<00:06:34.099> are<00:06:34.310> consuming<00:06:35.770> that's<00:06:36.770> your<00:06:37.099> that's<00:06:37.909> my

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:38.090 
cash are consuming that's your that's my

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:41.950 
cash are consuming that's your that's my
average<00:06:38.380> mile<00:06:39.380> per<00:06:39.560> gallon<00:06:40.539> 36.2<00:06:41.539> so<00:06:41.810> that's

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:41.960 
average mile per gallon 36.2 so that's

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:46.140 
average mile per gallon 36.2 so that's
what<00:06:42.080> I<00:06:42.110> average<00:06:42.409> when<00:06:42.560> I<00:06:42.620> ride<00:06:44.229> that's<00:06:45.229> a<00:06:45.380> trip

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:46.150 
what I average when I ride that's a trip

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:50.129 
what I average when I ride that's a trip
this<00:06:47.150> how<00:06:47.270> many<00:06:47.330> miles<00:06:47.659> I<00:06:47.810> have<00:06:47.840> one<00:06:48.139> of<00:06:48.259> 1,400

00:06:50.129 --> 00:06:50.139 
this how many miles I have one of 1,400

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:55.420 
this how many miles I have one of 1,400
so<00:06:51.139> and<00:06:51.500> and<00:06:52.000> outside<00:06:53.000> of<00:06:53.150> that<00:06:53.469> it's<00:06:54.469> it's

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:55.430 
so and and outside of that it's it's

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:58.059 
so and and outside of that it's it's
really<00:06:55.719> complicated<00:06:56.719> and<00:06:57.500> I<00:06:57.590> haven't<00:06:57.919> really

00:06:58.059 --> 00:06:58.069 
really complicated and I haven't really

00:06:58.069 --> 00:07:00.520 
really complicated and I haven't really
taken<00:06:58.370> the<00:06:58.580> time<00:06:58.610> to<00:06:58.969> figure<00:06:59.180> out<00:06:59.360> what's<00:07:00.289> what

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:00.530 
taken the time to figure out what's what

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:04.809 
taken the time to figure out what's what
on<00:07:00.710> this<00:07:00.860> so<00:07:01.659> that's<00:07:02.659> really<00:07:02.840> it<00:07:02.990> oh<00:07:03.610> the<00:07:04.610> show
