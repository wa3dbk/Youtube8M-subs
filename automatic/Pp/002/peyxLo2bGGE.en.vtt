00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450
 in the pp 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.120
 hello good kids we are here with 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.700
 a new video and good today I bring you the 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.369
 new titles that have come out for xbox 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:21.770
 I do not know if for play they will already be 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:24.349
 removed an update for the xbox and 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.900
 well put a title for each 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:29.690
 prestige that I have when I'm a teacher 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.580
 I already have them all and the truth is that 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:34.610
 thank goodness because I liked the last one 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:37.010
 quite and in the previous to the teacher 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.480
 he was also pretty handsome and good 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.040
 to vary a bit because the truth that 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.960
 it's good that things come out of these 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.960
 new and above without paying because 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:48.019
 lately they are having a bit of fun 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.449
 all this about the camouflage and that and nothing 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:54.170
 I also come with three streaks that 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:55.879
 take me out this week and well the first 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.739
 it is with the vector with silencer and 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:01.250
 fast charger is in land war 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:03.920
 in grint and good the best ways to 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.950
 get the ultra low and all this 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.320
 well they are clearly terrestrial war 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.299
 and I think team duel too 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.300
 is pretty good is where I take the 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:16.910
 ultra low the first other low that 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.970
 apart from the others that I dropped the 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:22.580
 connection and I lost a string of casualties and 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.410
 an ultra low but good that's the 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.330
 better way together with everything by teams at 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.660
 not to have objective because people like that 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.430
 it goes a little more lost and they do not have 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.560
 account if they are locked up as a 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.350
 domain and that they know you're there 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.700
 instead you waiting for and that in a 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.300
 duel for team because they go a little more 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.940
 lost and there I think it's the best way 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.830
 lately that's what I'm going with gusts 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.620
 high and I understand with these gusts I go 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.990
 towards sack get and of the casualties 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.790
 these that I already told you but good if 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.060
 the streak leaves with a drop of 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:58.310
 these would already be a pass and and nothing 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.310
 second is on the same map the same 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.780
 departure was but good is a super low 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.060
 of these is I think it's the best area 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.040
 is this part of the map to get 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.570
 the streak although up is also 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.399
 pretty good when they're locked 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.050
 Up there 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.480
 but this part almost that I like more 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.610
 for a submachine gun with shotguns so 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.530
 it is better the top part and good the 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.300
 third streak is with the b-23 here 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.480
 I was wearing the 94 line 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:26.090
 I did not kill anyone and I killed one but this 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.130
 He did not tell me because here I already lost the 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.500
 time with this he could not give 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.990
 not a bullet and good I took the b-23 not 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.390
 I was carrying fast charger in nothing and good 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.190
 I really liked the play because in 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.200
 domain to be domain you can load 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.630
 make yourself a mega low of these is 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.270
 rather more fucking but good load me 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:47.300
 the whole team and nothing killed me anymore 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:49.480
 I hope you liked it and even the 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.480
 next
