so<00:01:00.660> we<00:01:00.840> pass<00:01:01.109> along<00:01:01.910> generations<00:01:02.910> of

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
so we pass along generations of

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.070 
so we pass along generations of
knowledge<00:01:04.220> even<00:01:05.220> though<00:01:05.400> we<00:01:06.180> know<00:01:06.420> we<00:01:06.479> all<00:01:06.780> get

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080

measured<00:01:07.590> on<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.490> wins<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:08.939> losses<00:01:09.150> I<00:01:09.830> really

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
measured on the wins and losses I really

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.899 
measured on the wins and losses I really
believe<00:01:11.189> that<00:01:11.430> we<00:01:11.700> wouldn't<00:01:11.909> all<00:01:12.090> be<00:01:12.150> here

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
even though the general did it no better

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.460 
even though the general did it no better
