against<00:01:58.880> the<00:01:58.969> PC<00:01:59.420> despite<00:02:00.140> the<00:02:00.320> fact<00:02:00.530> that

00:02:00.669 --> 00:02:00.679 
against the PC despite the fact that

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:02.709 
against the PC despite the fact that
obviously<00:02:01.219> the<00:02:01.399> PC<00:02:01.729> version<00:02:02.179> isn't

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:02.719 
obviously the PC version isn't

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:05.080 
obviously the PC version isn't
particularly<00:02:03.049> super<00:02:03.590> duper<00:02:03.859> taxing<00:02:04.399> and

particularly super duper taxing and
there<00:02:05.899> are<00:02:06.079> definitely<00:02:06.380> benefits<00:02:06.859> to<00:02:07.249> the<00:02:07.340> PC

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
there are definitely benefits to the PC

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.730 
there are definitely benefits to the PC
version<00:02:08.030> primarily<00:02:08.720> the<00:02:08.929> fact<00:02:09.170> that<00:02:09.350> the<00:02:09.440> PC

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
version primarily the fact that the PC

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.050 
version primarily the fact that the PC
version<00:02:10.039> has<00:02:10.250> a<00:02:10.429> better

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060

field-of-view the ps4 version can feel

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:15.520 
field-of-view the ps4 version can feel
somewhat<00:02:14.090> claustrophobic<00:02:15.020> because<00:02:15.200> it's

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
somewhat claustrophobic because it's

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.860 
somewhat claustrophobic because it's
definitely<00:02:16.069> more<00:02:16.280> zoomed<00:02:16.550> in<00:02:16.849> I<00:02:17.090> have<00:02:17.840> a

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
definitely more zoomed in I have a

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
definitely more zoomed in I have a
feeling<00:02:18.260> there's<00:02:18.380> a<00:02:18.410> couple<00:02:18.560> of<00:02:18.709> reasons

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
feeling there's a couple of reasons

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.760 
feeling there's a couple of reasons
behind<00:02:19.250> this<00:02:19.640> one<00:02:20.030> because<00:02:20.900> well<00:02:21.470> if<00:02:21.650> you've

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
behind this one because well if you've

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.470 
behind this one because well if you've
got<00:02:21.890> to<00:02:21.980> play<00:02:22.160> on<00:02:22.400> a<00:02:22.430> larger<00:02:22.880> TV<00:02:23.239> maybe

they probably figure you want to be a

they probably figure you want to be a

reason<00:02:28.459> is<00:02:28.730> it<00:02:28.880> definitely<00:02:29.450> helps<00:02:29.870> the

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
reason is it definitely helps the

the game however for the best quality
settings<00:03:06.709> you<00:03:07.250> would<00:03:07.370> actually<00:03:07.549> enable<00:03:08.060> it<00:03:08.180> on

can<00:03:11.810> definitely<00:03:12.049> see<00:03:12.530> extra<00:03:13.010> fidelity<00:03:13.549> if<00:03:13.640> you

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
can definitely see extra fidelity if you

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.370 
can definitely see extra fidelity if you
would<00:03:13.910> for<00:03:14.090> example<00:03:14.170> enable<00:03:15.170> F<00:03:15.430> MSAA<00:03:16.430> times<00:03:16.940> 4

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
would for example enable F MSAA times 4

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.780 
would for example enable F MSAA times 4
however<00:03:18.380> I've<00:03:18.530> not<00:03:18.829> done<00:03:19.070> so<00:03:19.310> for<00:03:19.519> the<00:03:19.579> sake<00:03:19.760> of

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
however I've not done so for the sake of

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569 
for example Nvidia's down sampling which

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:28.360 
for example Nvidia's down sampling which
would<00:03:26.780> also<00:03:27.140> once<00:03:27.440> again<00:03:27.560> improve<00:03:28.190> the

graphical fidelity however in my
personal<00:03:30.560> opinion<00:03:30.850> since<00:03:31.850> most<00:03:32.180> people

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
personal opinion since most people

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:33.880 
personal opinion since most people
aren't<00:03:32.630> going<00:03:32.750> to<00:03:32.810> be<00:03:32.900> doing<00:03:33.140> a<00:03:33.319> say<00:03:33.680> down

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
aren't going to be doing a say down

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:35.979 
aren't going to be doing a say down
sampling<00:03:34.400> and<00:03:34.579> I<00:03:34.670> mean<00:03:34.880> the<00:03:35.000> average<00:03:35.150> user<00:03:35.660> I

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
sampling and I mean the average user I

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:38.740 
sampling and I mean the average user I
figured<00:03:36.739> I<00:03:36.890> would<00:03:37.040> go<00:03:37.250> for<00:03:37.579> kind<00:03:38.060> of<00:03:38.180> the<00:03:38.390> happy

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.050 
one and the PC definitely there are
slight<00:03:53.720> subtle<00:03:54.350> differences<00:03:54.980> but<00:03:55.730> for<00:03:56.000> the

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
slight subtle differences but for the

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.520 
slight subtle differences but for the
most<00:03:56.239> part<00:03:56.510> you<00:03:56.660> can't<00:03:56.959> really<00:03:57.230> tell<00:03:57.500> the

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
most part you can't really tell the

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:58.990 
most part you can't really tell the
difference<00:03:57.709> you're<00:03:58.370> going<00:03:58.489> to<00:03:58.549> be<00:03:58.609> finding

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
difference you're going to be finding

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.509 
difference you're going to be finding
that<00:03:59.180> the<00:03:59.660> experiences<00:04:00.650> are<00:04:00.829> pretty<00:04:00.889> much

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
that the experiences are pretty much

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:04.210 
that the experiences are pretty much
identical<00:04:01.989> there<00:04:02.989> is<00:04:03.139> a<00:04:03.350> little<00:04:03.920> bit<00:04:04.100> of

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
identical there is a little bit of

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.160 
identical there is a little bit of
difference<00:04:04.670> in<00:04:04.850> terms<00:04:05.269> of<00:04:05.480> lighting<00:04:05.750> I<00:04:06.019> have

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
difference in terms of lighting I have

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.050 
difference in terms of lighting I have
noticed<00:04:06.590> the<00:04:06.680> ps4<00:04:07.100> version<00:04:07.489> does

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
noticed the ps4 version does

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.879 
noticed the ps4 version does
occasionally<00:04:08.480> appear<00:04:09.170> I<00:04:09.440> have<00:04:09.620> a<00:04:09.709> little

big deal and factual actually noticed

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.159 
big deal and factual actually noticed
this<00:04:18.889> between<00:04:19.250> say<00:04:19.459> an<00:04:19.519> ATI<00:04:20.150> card<00:04:20.599> or<00:04:20.750> Chasse

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
this between say an ATI card or Chasse

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:24.339 
this between say an ATI card or Chasse
AMD<00:04:21.620> card<00:04:21.919> and<00:04:22.130> an<00:04:22.669> nvidia<00:04:23.180> card<00:04:23.510> at<00:04:23.690> time

AMD card and an nvidia card at time

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:26.350 
AMD card and an nvidia card at time
so<00:04:24.949> if<00:04:25.069> you're<00:04:25.220> concerned<00:04:25.639> with<00:04:25.849> how<00:04:26.030> the<00:04:26.060> game

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
so if you're concerned with how the game

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.140 
so if you're concerned with how the game
is<00:04:26.539> gonna<00:04:26.690> run<00:04:26.960> on<00:04:27.199> the<00:04:27.319> ps4<00:04:27.620> is<00:04:28.250> absolutely<00:04:28.879> no

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
is gonna run on the ps4 is absolutely no

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.290 
is gonna run on the ps4 is absolutely no
need<00:04:29.360> to<00:04:29.539> worry<00:04:29.810> it<00:04:30.289> plays<00:04:30.650> very<00:04:30.830> well<00:04:31.039> and<00:04:31.610> I

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
need to worry it plays very well and I

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.689 
need to worry it plays very well and I
have<00:04:32.539> to<00:04:32.690> say<00:04:32.900> graphically<00:04:33.650> it<00:04:33.889> is<00:04:34.099> pretty

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:34.699 
have to say graphically it is pretty

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:37.990 
have to say graphically it is pretty
much<00:04:34.970> identical<00:04:35.210> to<00:04:36.080> the<00:04:36.229> PC<00:04:36.620> aside<00:04:37.129> from<00:04:37.460> the

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
much identical to the PC aside from the

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.809 
much identical to the PC aside from the
weak<00:04:38.210> fov<00:04:38.900> and<00:04:39.199> the<00:04:39.379> inferior<00:04:39.979> anti-aliasing

00:04:40.809 --> 00:04:40.819 
weak fov and the inferior anti-aliasing

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:43.570 
weak fov and the inferior anti-aliasing
and<00:04:41.000> the<00:04:41.750> occasional<00:04:42.710> slowdown

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
and the occasional slowdown

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.300 
and the occasional slowdown
so<00:04:44.240> yes<00:04:44.539> the<00:04:44.750> PC<00:04:45.080> version<00:04:45.470> does<00:04:45.860> look<00:04:46.069> a<00:04:46.190> little

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
so yes the PC version does look a little

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.930 
so yes the PC version does look a little
better

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
better

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.170 
better
but<00:04:47.240> it's<00:04:47.419> not<00:04:47.659> the<00:04:47.870> usual<00:04:48.280> large<00:04:49.280> gap<00:04:49.729> that<00:04:50.120> a

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
but it's not the usual large gap that a

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.740 
but it's not the usual large gap that a
PC<00:04:50.750> and<00:04:50.900> a<00:04:50.990> ps4<00:04:51.470> would<00:04:51.680> normally<00:04:52.069> have<00:04:52.789> as<00:04:53.449> a

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
PC and a ps4 would normally have as a

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.570 
PC and a ps4 would normally have as a
note<00:04:54.110> about<00:04:54.440> the<00:04:54.560> gameplay<00:04:54.800> I<00:04:55.009> have<00:04:55.280> to<00:04:55.400> say

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
note about the gameplay I have to say

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.279 
note about the gameplay I have to say
I've<00:04:55.759> been<00:04:55.849> playing<00:04:56.090> the<00:04:56.270> ps4<00:04:56.569> version<00:04:56.810> quite

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:57.289 
I've been playing the ps4 version quite

00:04:57.289 --> 00:04:58.930 
I've been playing the ps4 version quite
substantially<00:04:57.919> over<00:04:58.069> the<00:04:58.159> last<00:04:58.280> few<00:04:58.520> days<00:04:58.699> as

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
substantially over the last few days as

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.129 
substantially over the last few days as
you<00:04:59.060> guys<00:04:59.270> probably<00:04:59.300> know<00:04:59.750> if<00:04:59.990> you've<00:05:00.110> been

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:00.139 
you guys probably know if you've been

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:01.600 
you guys probably know if you've been
watching<00:05:00.500> on<00:05:00.590> there<00:05:00.770> to<00:05:00.860> play<00:05:01.009> and<00:05:01.370> I've<00:05:01.460> also

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
watching on there to play and I've also

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:02.920 
watching on there to play and I've also
been<00:05:01.849> playing<00:05:02.120> some<00:05:02.270> co-op<00:05:02.630> and<00:05:02.780> it's

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
been playing some co-op and it's

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.260 
been playing some co-op and it's
amazingly<00:05:03.530> fun<00:05:04.009> I<00:05:04.220> would<00:05:04.819> actually<00:05:04.970> recommend

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
amazingly fun I would actually recommend

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.689 
amazingly fun I would actually recommend
that<00:05:05.960> if<00:05:06.139> you<00:05:06.349> are<00:05:06.620> considering<00:05:07.069> picking<00:05:07.400> up

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:07.699 
that if you are considering picking up

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:10.779 
that if you are considering picking up
on<00:05:07.970> the<00:05:08.180> ps4<00:05:08.449> for<00:05:08.900> carpel<00:05:09.560> reasons<00:05:09.889> it<00:05:10.220> really

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:10.789 
on the ps4 for carpel reasons it really

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:12.580 
on the ps4 for carpel reasons it really
is<00:05:10.880> worth<00:05:11.090> it<00:05:11.300> local<00:05:11.690> play<00:05:11.870> is<00:05:11.930> an<00:05:12.139> absolute

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
is worth it local play is an absolute

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.459 
is worth it local play is an absolute
blast<00:05:12.889> I<00:05:13.400> have<00:05:14.060> to<00:05:14.240> say<00:05:14.419> that<00:05:14.750> I<00:05:14.900> don't<00:05:15.199> feel

00:05:15.459 --> 00:05:15.469 
blast I have to say that I don't feel

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:18.249 
blast I have to say that I don't feel
the<00:05:15.530> ps4<00:05:16.039> or<00:05:16.430> the<00:05:16.580> PC<00:05:16.909> version<00:05:17.270> is<00:05:17.360> better<00:05:17.719> this

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:18.259 
the ps4 or the PC version is better this

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:19.689 
the ps4 or the PC version is better this
is<00:05:18.319> one<00:05:18.590> of<00:05:18.650> those<00:05:18.710> times<00:05:18.949> where<00:05:19.130> I<00:05:19.159> honestly

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:19.699 
is one of those times where I honestly

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:21.100 
is one of those times where I honestly
feel<00:05:19.880> it's<00:05:20.120> split<00:05:20.419> right<00:05:20.690> down<00:05:20.750> the<00:05:21.080> middle

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
feel it's split right down the middle

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:22.149 
feel it's split right down the middle
and<00:05:21.469> it's<00:05:21.560> down<00:05:21.770> to<00:05:21.889> your<00:05:22.009> personal

00:05:22.149 --> 00:05:22.159 
and it's down to your personal

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:24.879 
and it's down to your personal
preference<00:05:22.840> controls<00:05:23.840> wise<00:05:24.110> I<00:05:24.319> do<00:05:24.379> still

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:24.889 
preference controls wise I do still

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:27.010 
preference controls wise I do still
prefer<00:05:25.219> the<00:05:25.370> PC<00:05:25.849> and<00:05:26.030> the<00:05:26.389> graphics<00:05:26.750> are<00:05:26.870> still

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 
prefer the PC and the graphics are still

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.770 
prefer the PC and the graphics are still
nicer<00:05:27.469> but<00:05:27.620> the<00:05:27.740> local<00:05:28.099> co-op<00:05:28.400> is<00:05:28.780> extremely

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
nicer but the local co-op is extremely

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.600 
nicer but the local co-op is extremely
fun<00:05:30.020> I<00:05:30.080> wish<00:05:30.560> they<00:05:30.740> would<00:05:30.860> implement<00:05:31.130> it<00:05:31.430> on

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
fun I wish they would implement it on

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.140 
fun I wish they would implement it on
the<00:05:31.969> PC<00:05:32.719> version<00:05:33.130> anyway<00:05:34.130> guys<00:05:34.340> hopefully<00:05:34.819> put
