00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:56.480 

they<00:01:51.200> can<00:01:51.380> see<00:01:51.590> us

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.070 

now<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.120> shiners<00:01:57.720> are<00:01:59.630> somewhat<00:02:00.630> I<00:02:00.659> think

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
now the shiners are somewhat I think

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.609 
now the shiners are somewhat I think
smarter<00:02:01.530> than<00:02:01.830> these<00:02:02.100> brim<00:02:02.400> and<00:02:03.200> if<00:02:04.200> I<00:02:04.290> start

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
smarter than these brim and if I start

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:05.780 
smarter than these brim and if I start
throwing<00:02:04.830> the<00:02:04.950> net<00:02:05.100> they<00:02:05.280> might<00:02:05.430> not<00:02:05.580> come

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
throwing the net they might not come

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.359 
throwing the net they might not come
close<00:02:06.060> where<00:02:07.050> I'll<00:02:07.470> catch<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.860> bunch<00:02:08.039> of<00:02:08.160> brand

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
close where I'll catch a bunch of brand

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.770 
close where I'll catch a bunch of brand
but<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.610> shiners<00:02:08.850> will<00:02:09.090> back<00:02:09.300> off

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
but the shiners will back off

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.410 
but the shiners will back off
so<00:02:10.289> foster<00:02:10.619> getting<00:02:10.830> a<00:02:10.890> little<00:02:11.009> johnboat<00:02:11.550> and

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
so foster getting a little johnboat and

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.880 
so foster getting a little johnboat and
go<00:02:12.569> a<00:02:12.600> little<00:02:12.660> further<00:02:13.020> than<00:02:13.200> where<00:02:13.500> I<00:02:13.530> usually

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
go a little further than where I usually

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.890 
go a little further than where I usually
throw<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.220> net<00:02:14.430> I<00:02:14.610> catch<00:02:15.239> a<00:02:15.330> lot<00:02:15.360> of<00:02:15.510> shiners

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
throw the net I catch a lot of shiners

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.090 
throw the net I catch a lot of shiners
because<00:02:16.230> they<00:02:16.350> don't<00:02:16.530> they're<00:02:16.739> not<00:02:16.770> used<00:02:17.040> to

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
because they don't they're not used to

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.170 
because they don't they're not used to
me<00:02:17.220> being<00:02:17.250> out<00:02:17.489> there<00:02:17.700> and<00:02:18.060> they<00:02:18.150> think

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
me being out there and they think

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:27.650 
me being out there and they think
they're<00:02:18.480> safer<00:02:18.840> that's<00:02:19.020> what<00:02:19.200> I<00:02:19.230> think<00:02:19.530> anyway

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
right now because if I got really

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.880

aggravated<00:04:09.020> because<00:04:09.080> these<00:04:09.319> shiners<00:04:09.530> aren't

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
aggravated because these shiners aren't

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:11.890 
aggravated because these shiners aren't
kind<00:04:09.980> of<00:04:10.099> smart<00:04:10.370> I<00:04:10.520> believe<00:04:10.790> I<00:04:11.060> would<00:04:11.540> just<00:04:11.780> hop

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
kind of smart I believe I would just hop

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.270 
kind of smart I believe I would just hop
in<00:04:12.110> the<00:04:12.170> boat<00:04:12.319> and<00:04:12.560> go<00:04:12.650> out<00:04:12.680> there<00:04:13.069> and<00:04:13.220> I

in the boat and go out there and I

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.520 
in the boat and go out there and I
probably<00:04:13.550> and<00:04:13.910> two<00:04:14.780> castes<00:04:15.200> have<00:04:15.230> all<00:04:15.440> the

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
probably and two castes have all the

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.199 
probably and two castes have all the
bait<00:04:15.709> I<00:04:15.739> really<00:04:16.100> would<00:04:16.220> love<00:04:16.370> for<00:04:16.459> now<00:04:16.669> I<00:04:16.880> don't

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
bait I really would love for now I don't

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:18.819 
bait I really would love for now I don't
like<00:04:17.450> to<00:04:17.570> catch<00:04:17.780> a<00:04:17.900> whole<00:04:18.049> bunch<00:04:18.350> of<00:04:18.500> bait<00:04:18.650> and

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:23.389 
here for next time so I'd probably only

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:25.960 
here for next time so I'd probably only
want<00:04:23.630> about<00:04:23.720> eight<00:04:24.139> shiners<00:04:24.860> for<00:04:25.100> now<00:04:25.250> so<00:04:25.820> me

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
want about eight shiners for now so me

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.100 
want about eight shiners for now so me
and<00:04:26.090> Matt<00:04:26.210> could<00:04:26.360> try<00:04:26.510> to<00:04:26.570> catch<00:04:26.750> some<00:04:26.930> bass

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
and Matt could try to catch some bass

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.270 
and Matt could try to catch some bass
and<00:04:27.350> if<00:04:27.410> we<00:04:27.500> need<00:04:27.680> more<00:04:27.860> we'll<00:04:28.010> catch<00:04:28.160> them

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
and if we need more we'll catch them

00:04:28.280 --> 00:05:01.740 
and if we need more we'll catch them
later

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.780 

I<00:05:01.870> can<00:05:02.440> actually<00:05:02.560> see<00:05:02.830> the<00:05:02.950> bread<00:05:03.190> go<00:05:03.430> flying

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:10.860 
I can actually see the bread go flying
underwater<00:05:04.120> to<00:05:04.540> the<00:05:04.660> bishop<00:05:04.990> back

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.000 

we're<00:05:11.260> going<00:05:11.380> to<00:05:11.440> go<00:05:11.500> ahead<00:05:11.590> and<00:05:11.770> throw<00:05:11.860> them

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.010
