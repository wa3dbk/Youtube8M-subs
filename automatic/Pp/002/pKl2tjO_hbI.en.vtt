00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
whether you consider delegation to be

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.119 
whether you consider delegation to be
too<00:00:42.329> much<00:00:42.480> time<00:00:42.809> taking<00:00:43.260> too<00:00:43.530> much<00:00:43.649> time<00:00:43.710> too

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
too much time taking too much time too

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.850 
too much time taking too much time too
much<00:00:44.160> effort<00:00:44.719> that's<00:00:45.719> when<00:00:46.050> people<00:00:46.530> start

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
much effort that's when people start

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.740 
much effort that's when people start
thinking<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:47.579> they<00:00:47.940> have<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.300> do<00:00:48.420> everything

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
thinking that they have to do everything

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.779 
thinking that they have to do everything
themselves<00:00:49.079> because<00:00:49.860> they<00:00:50.070> can<00:00:50.250> do<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.520> better

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
themselves because they can do it better

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.450 
themselves because they can do it better
but<00:00:51.510> when<00:00:51.690> you<00:00:51.840> switch<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:52.500> around<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:53.160> switch

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
but when you switch it around and switch

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.750 
but when you switch it around and switch
that<00:00:53.730> whole<00:00:54.230> notion<00:00:55.230> that<00:00:56.010> you<00:00:56.070> can<00:00:56.520> use

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
that whole notion that you can use

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.180 
that whole notion that you can use
delegation<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.449> your<00:00:57.750> advantage<00:00:58.140> not<00:00:58.980> only

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
delegation to your advantage not only

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.459 
delegation to your advantage not only
are<00:00:59.489> you<00:00:59.520> opening<00:01:00.329> yourself<00:01:00.480> up<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:00.989> other
