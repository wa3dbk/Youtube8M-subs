00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
linear grooves and to play them it's

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.660 
linear grooves and to play them it's
very<00:01:00.780> essential<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:02.309> get<00:01:02.969> these<00:01:03.500> exercises

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
very essential to get these exercises

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.789 
very essential to get these exercises
first<00:01:05.670> one<00:01:06.030> is<00:01:06.270> very<00:01:06.570> easy<00:01:07.729> you<00:01:08.729> put<00:01:09.799> three

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
first one is very easy you put three

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.510 
first one is very easy you put three
notes<00:01:11.070> together<00:01:12.380> two<00:01:13.380> with<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.920> hands<00:01:14.340> and

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
or on to sound surfaces so now you can

00:01:48.700 --> 00:02:07.830 
or on to sound surfaces so now you can
use<00:01:49.119> your<00:01:49.600> left<00:01:49.899> foot<00:01:50.350> of<00:01:50.709> course<00:01:51.039> -<00:02:06.509> so<00:02:07.509> only

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
with this exercise you can create some

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.050 
with this exercise you can create some
cool<00:02:11.110> grooves<00:02:11.560> when<00:02:12.310> you<00:02:12.519> change<00:02:12.849> between

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
cool grooves when you change between

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.390 
cool grooves when you change between
your<00:02:13.390> left<00:02:13.599> foot<00:02:14.019> and<00:02:14.290> your<00:02:14.470> right<00:02:14.500> foot<00:02:14.709> and

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
your left foot and your right foot and

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:49.740 
your left foot and your right foot and

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
putting some accents onto the groove the

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.680 
putting some accents onto the groove the
other<00:02:49.870> idea<00:02:50.319> is<00:02:50.650> to<00:02:51.069> double<00:02:51.609> your<00:02:52.209> strokes

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
other idea is to double your strokes

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.009 
other idea is to double your strokes
with<00:02:53.049> each<00:02:53.319> hand<00:02:53.739> so<00:02:54.269> therefore<00:02:55.269> it's<00:02:55.690> great

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
with each hand so therefore it's great

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:58.530 
with each hand so therefore it's great
exercise<00:02:56.560> to<00:02:56.739> begin<00:02:56.859> with<00:02:57.370> double<00:02:57.849> strokes<00:02:58.269> of

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
exercise to begin with double strokes of

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.870 
exercise to begin with double strokes of
course<00:02:58.840> ride<00:02:59.349> right<00:02:59.680> left<00:03:00.069> left<00:03:00.370> right<00:03:00.670> right

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
course ride right left left right right

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:20.100 
course ride right left left right right
left<00:03:01.180> left<00:03:01.870> and<00:03:02.170> putting<00:03:03.130> it<00:03:03.250> to<00:03:03.489> the<00:03:03.519> limits

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.280 

so<00:03:21.110> there<00:03:21.650> are<00:03:21.680> some<00:03:22.130> cool<00:03:22.400> ideas<00:03:22.610> with<00:03:23.540> this

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
so there are some cool ideas with this

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:35.530 
so there are some cool ideas with this
kind<00:03:24.920> of<00:03:25.040> motion<00:03:33.340> my<00:03:34.340> right<00:03:34.580> hand<00:03:34.910> placed<00:03:35.300> some
