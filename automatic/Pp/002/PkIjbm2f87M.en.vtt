the high beam on the place to low beam

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:22.460 
the high beam on the place to low beam
and<00:00:15.710> the<00:00:16.710> bulb<00:00:16.980> is<00:00:18.289> right<00:00:19.850> here<00:00:21.260> as<00:00:22.260> you<00:00:22.380> can

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
and the bulb is right here as you can

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.210 
and the bulb is right here as you can
see<00:00:22.740> it's<00:00:22.949> hard<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.279> get<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:24.859> main<00:00:25.859> thing<00:00:26.070> is

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
see it's hard to get to main thing is

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.330 
see it's hard to get to main thing is
this<00:00:26.340> power<00:00:26.670> steering<00:00:28.130> reservoirs<00:00:29.130> in<00:00:29.310> the

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
this power steering reservoirs in the

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:37.330 
this power steering reservoirs in the
way<00:00:29.550> so<00:00:31.550> you<00:00:32.550> can<00:00:33.170> kind<00:00:34.170> of<00:00:34.260> disconnect<00:00:34.950> that

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.530 

what<00:00:38.340> it<00:00:38.460> filled<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:38.910> give<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.360> lot<00:00:39.510> of

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
what it filled it and give you a lot of

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.510 
what it filled it and give you a lot of
room<00:00:39.980> so<00:00:40.980> what<00:00:41.340> I'm<00:00:41.460> trying<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:41.850> do<00:00:42.059> is<00:00:43.520> this

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
room so what I'm trying to do is this

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.400 
room so what I'm trying to do is this
bracket<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.420> hopefully<00:00:46.110> I<00:00:46.140> have<00:00:46.379> enough

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
bracket and hopefully I have enough

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:54.920 
bracket and hopefully I have enough
range<00:00:47.030> get<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.210> that<00:00:48.420> pull<00:00:48.780> down<00:00:49.940> there<00:00:53.930> right

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
range get to that pull down there right

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.389 
range get to that pull down there right
back<00:00:55.140> there<00:00:57.320> so<00:00:58.320> fortunately<00:00:58.890> even<00:00:59.250> though

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
back there so fortunately even though

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.900 
back there so fortunately even though
it's<00:00:59.550> hard<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.820> get<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:01.170> looks<00:01:01.410> like<00:01:01.649> I<00:01:01.920> can

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
it's hard to get to it looks like I can

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.300 
it's hard to get to it looks like I can
use<00:01:03.149> this<00:01:03.449> um<00:01:04.460> so<00:01:05.460> six<00:01:06.979> six<00:01:07.979> inch<00:01:08.189> long

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
use this um so six six inch long

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.030 
use this um so six six inch long
extension<00:01:09.060> 10<00:01:09.750> millimeter<00:01:10.229> deep<00:01:11.270> socket<00:01:12.270> and

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
extension 10 millimeter deep socket and

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:25.960 
extension 10 millimeter deep socket and
I<00:01:14.040> can<00:01:14.580> get<00:01:14.729> right<00:01:14.909> in<00:01:15.060> there<00:01:15.890> onto<00:01:16.890> that<00:01:17.009> bowl

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.370

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
all right well now it's like there's

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.100 
all right well now it's like there's
another<00:01:28.890> bulb<00:01:31.549> alright<00:01:32.549> this<00:01:33.509> one<00:01:33.780> was<00:01:33.960> hard

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
another bulb alright this one was hard

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.620 
another bulb alright this one was hard
to<00:01:34.380> get<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.890> but

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:46.660 

basically<00:01:41.780> lifted<00:01:43.040> the<00:01:44.040> reservoir<00:01:44.610> up<00:01:45.390> and

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
basically lifted the reservoir up and

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.030 
basically lifted the reservoir up and
towards<00:01:47.670> my<00:01:47.790> right<00:01:48.290> now<00:01:49.290> I<00:01:49.320> was<00:01:49.530> just<00:01:49.740> barely

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:08.290 
the dust cover should slide on pretty

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.730 
the dust cover should slide on pretty
easily

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
easily

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:17.780 
easily
and<00:05:08.950> then<00:05:09.370> just<00:05:09.700> plug<00:05:10.690> the<00:05:11.100> connector<00:05:12.100> back

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:21.800 

and<00:05:18.790> yeah<00:05:19.000> hopefully<00:05:19.630> we'll<00:05:19.930> have<00:05:20.050> a

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:36.930 
now we just got to put this bracket back
which<00:05:35.590> seems<00:05:35.890> a<00:05:36.040> little<00:05:36.160> bit<00:05:36.370> tricky<00:05:36.730> but

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:36.940 
which seems a little bit tricky but

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.340 
which seems a little bit tricky but
hopefully<00:05:37.750> won't<00:05:37.900> be<00:05:38.020> too<00:05:38.260> bad<00:05:39.000> I'm<00:05:40.000> just

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.350 
hopefully won't be too bad I'm just

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:46.110 
hopefully won't be too bad I'm just
going<00:05:41.350> to<00:05:42.660> put<00:05:43.660> the<00:05:43.870> first<00:05:44.140> bolt<00:05:44.560> in<00:05:44.880> the<00:05:45.880> hole

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
going to put the first bolt in the hole

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:51.210 
going to put the first bolt in the hole
here<00:05:47.100> already<00:05:48.100> with<00:05:48.580> my<00:05:48.910> arm<00:05:49.950> so<00:05:50.950> I<00:05:51.010> could

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.220 
here already with my arm so I could

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.070 
here already with my arm so I could
extension<00:05:51.760> and<00:05:51.970> just<00:05:52.210> kind<00:05:52.390> of<00:05:52.450> like<00:05:52.600> lower<00:05:52.840> it

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080 
extension and just kind of like lower it

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.600 
extension and just kind of like lower it
in<00:05:53.320> place<00:05:55.050> all<00:05:56.050> right<00:05:56.320> so<00:05:56.740> I<00:05:56.770> got<00:05:57.070> the<00:05:57.190> bracket

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.610 
in place all right so I got the bracket

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:01.340 
in place all right so I got the bracket
back<00:05:57.730> in<00:05:57.910> place<00:05:58.150> um<00:05:58.950> it<00:05:59.950> was<00:06:00.130> pretty<00:06:00.430> difficult

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:01.350 
back in place um it was pretty difficult

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:03.750 
back in place um it was pretty difficult
the<00:06:02.350> one<00:06:02.560> closer<00:06:03.100> this<00:06:03.280> way

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:03.760 
the one closer this way

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:07.020 
the one closer this way
I'm<00:06:03.940> I<00:06:04.120> basically<00:06:04.540> stuck<00:06:04.990> on<00:06:05.169> hand<00:06:05.610> all<00:06:06.610> the

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:07.030 
I'm I basically stuck on hand all the

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:11.700 
I'm I basically stuck on hand all the
way<00:06:07.090> here<00:06:09.120> and<00:06:10.120> just<00:06:10.720> barely<00:06:11.169> reached<00:06:11.470> in

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:11.710 
way here and just barely reached in

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:12.960 
way here and just barely reached in
there<00:06:11.860> it<00:06:12.160> was<00:06:12.250> pretty<00:06:12.490> difficult

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:12.970 
there it was pretty difficult

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:16.920 
there it was pretty difficult
oh<00:06:13.470> but<00:06:14.470> honestly<00:06:14.919> I<00:06:15.040> think<00:06:15.330> if<00:06:16.330> you<00:06:16.510> got<00:06:16.660> one

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:16.930 
oh but honestly I think if you got one

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:24.120 
oh but honestly I think if you got one
of<00:06:17.080> them<00:06:17.200> is<00:06:17.380> probably<00:06:17.770> okay<00:06:20.700> put<00:06:21.700> that<00:06:21.850> back
