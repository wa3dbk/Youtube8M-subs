00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:06.540
 hello youtube friends this today les 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.540
 I come to bring a tutorial of how 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:13.530
 repair the god tablet that does not start 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:16.880
 this good tablet look at the problem is 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.880
 we leave 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.180
 and then it surprised how you can see 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.180
 Well, you learned 

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:35.300
 the problem is that there is 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.970
 I work on the tablet or sometimes it starts 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.160
 but nothing works that what they should 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.490
 to do is to turn it off, to press the 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.490
 button 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.679
 He said 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:50.540
 already turned off and we will have the tour 

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:54.170
 pressing 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:58.280
 these two buttons that are to go up 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:02.570
 volume up east and the home east 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:04.750
 is this it is hard to see here there 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.750
 we go 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.540
 we wait a while 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.100
 until they turn on record systems and there 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.100
 is 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:29.350
 as we can see he sent us to the tour 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.590
 we give it where a factor says me here in 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:37.210
 the third where it says invoice recipe 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:40.840
 here we give in home and we go to 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:44.729
 where it says it's from the time of 'late 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.729
 night ' user data 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:54.490
 until we get here we give it in com and it 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.490
 these metrics will appear 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.560
 we wait 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:10.670
 and when we are completed this is 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.670
 they give in ribot system not 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.880
 and as you can see then the tablet is going to 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.880
 restart 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.870
 and they are there as you can see it is already 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.870
 tearing 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.040
 and we'll wait a little 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:54.040
 we wait for him to load 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:00.440
 It can take from 5 to 10 minutes if a lot 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.040
 there it is loading wait 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:34.220
 do not despair if you are going to start one that 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:40.520
 charge nothing else if they have a tablet 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:44.740
 god as well as is god who has 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.740
 many failures to me has failed me a lot 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.150
 and because this is a problem of which 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:53.740
 I see that many 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:56.230
 and here is the fence 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.420
 there is how you can see then 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.480
 the tablet all you have to do is 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:04.440
 apply in accept 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:08.310
 and there's the tablet going to erase everything 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:11.069
 all you and how can you see then 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.080
 everything worked already started and nothing else 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:15.350
 typical without accepting 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.329
 and then the tablet will be there 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:20.780
 pulling 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:23.000
 We charge for doing this because I 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.129
 I sent them to fail once and they charged me and 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.840
 Well, as you can see, they are going to 

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:33.560
 lose the account in lending and no longer 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:37.730
 they wait for everything to be updated 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:41.690
 and the wifi network if they had then they are going to 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:44.240
 erase everything is erased all good the only thing 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:46.040
 that they are super user root is not going 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.010
 to pass anything if per root user it 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:52.790
 is saved as for example I am 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:55.460
 super user and there is my super 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:05:00.490
 root user is not deleted everything follows 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.490
 good good I hope and serve you goodbye
