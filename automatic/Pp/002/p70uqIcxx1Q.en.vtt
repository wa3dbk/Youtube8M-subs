00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.420
 hello guys and welcome back to those 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.190
 two we observe we have tried in these 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.750
 days a game 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.199
 ask we had already heard 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.570
 in short, around and it looked nice if it did 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.369
 go over the perina us with the bread 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.920
 roads the clashes on steam that by now 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.810
 we know a bit like how it works alive 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.730
 summer clean up your wallet 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.390
 we bought it we're talking about 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.030
 scribblenauts this is the matter 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.129
 developed by lamps ixelles and is a 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.219
 play very cute and funny that 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.840
 can be say also used in 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.289
 shorter time lapses 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.840
 then no game came out for wiew 3ds e 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.579
 pc so these are the platforms on 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.559
 which this game runs with some 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.379
 small difference especially for 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.550
 regarding the 3ds some small 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.789
 limitation however boys 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.649
 basically sexy it seems to be missing 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:03.059
 publishing of character creation 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.739
 however we have tried the 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.020
 pc version so we will refer to the 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.210
 pc version of what it is 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.909
 you are maxwell he was given a 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.909
 magic notebook with your sister 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.920
 can register two turkey appear there 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.680
 the objects you write and owe in 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.080
 reality just travel the world just that 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.530
 come out of your house do the 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.210
 first bullshit and that is to piss off one 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.400
 old witch who sends a curse 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.530
 on the little sister who came together a 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.869
 bit of this trip and so this 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.030
 your way turning into a statue 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:44.690
 and you must do good deeds for 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.920
 prevent returns from redeeming you and can 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.630
 layer of air she has nothing to do with cock 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.240
 in this story he immediately went to 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.700
 successful targeting by the witch 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.350
 naturally doing this you will acquire 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.330
 also the special skill of yours 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.910
 sister who is practically able to turn 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:02.090
 from one point to another in this world ed 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:05.990
 has attached to travel and stratospheric and 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.789
 quick p3 while in the then there is a 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.090
 light an let's say an addition to this 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:12.709
 bernat unlimited script then there is a 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.190
 arrived in this script bernalda al 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:18.290
 limit compared to previous versions 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.820
 and dell objects editor ie i 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.740
 objects that we write on the carpet 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.110
 notebook that then appear 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.960
 we can also avoid them if not 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.880
 we can can create new ones 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:32.000
 we can decide that that determined 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.830
 object maybe we don't like we can a 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.660
 giant robot take off his leg 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.580
 we take off an arm and an arm that 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.860
 belongs to another figure in other words is 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.870
 very very expensive very creative like 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.910
 game starting a moment of the graphics 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:48.290
 because in my opinion there is to be spent a little 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:50.210
 of words then write natali is not a 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.530
 game with realistic graphics neither 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:54.350
 let alone three-dimensional graphics 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:57.980
 and this I believe is a requirement 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:00.610
 due to the fact that it has an archive of 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.470
 words of characters' objects 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.720
 almost endless so make gods 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.580
 3d polygonal models for each single 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.530
 what to do there had been a delirium 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.210
 it would have been a delusion, however, against it 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.180
 we have a very nice graphic 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:16.160
 cartoonish with a distinct appeal 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:19.670
 cool fun very very nice 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.050
 which refers a bit to the le baxi hype type 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.080
 cardan puppets 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.670
 so there is the income of the arts open no 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.290
 so they are not think they are 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.540
 since they are visions they are still 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.610
 they are however very animated 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.519
 so motive we say that it is even 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.950
 been published by let's say by warner 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:40.040
 bros therefore somehow this 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.420
 this usa cartoon graphics remembers i 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.819
 tones of the voice 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.379
 having said that we pass to the gameplay as 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:48.829
 we said before it was very fast but 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:51.019
 always very very immediately they are cooked 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:53.090
 levels usual layered structure 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:56.870
 finished the level we have a mini game 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:59.060
 a little more in-depth where we will have to 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.489
 always helping a person to solve i 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.620
 his love problems or what I know 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:06.889
 we must have to help a curator of 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.599
 a museum to raise some funds 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:11.060
 so what we need to do 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:14.389
 for example we have to buy flowers 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:17.060
 for our lover to buy one 

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:20.989
 that is , I would like this machine too 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:22.580
 home I want to understand that it's the guys 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.090
 this is the heart of the game 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.020
 finding the right word is therefore 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.849
 materialize the right object that 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.590
 resolve the issue more often 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:32.449
 these questions however above all if 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.389
 concern some characters a little 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:38.210
 cattivelli the solution almost always god 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:39.919
 but then you owe us more than 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.229
 nardÃ² in a cabinet called and god 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:43.880
 god god solves everything i solve everything 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:45.800
 it is however not called the devil if you have 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.419
 call and make slaughterhouses 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.550
 but if you want to see fights 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:52.010
 epic diana del dail devils and then yes 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.920
 put with vaden they own though 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.710
 always wins 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:58.530
 in tank one hundred I have to do 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.390
 then guys there isn't much else to 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.730
 say that if a game would go 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:04.800
 tried unfortunately suffers from mechanics 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:07.740
 a tad too repetitive in the sense 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.910
 that as it is very interesting in 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.710
 of type of gameplay 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:13.050
 in the end you always find yourself doing the 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:15.330
 same thing I had to guess of famous 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:18.260
 the right word at the right time but 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:21.420
 this is the game is the fulcrum of the game yes 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:23.700
 reveals the game is very fast 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:26.580
 being very pleasant for the graphics 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:30.360
 those who also pass quite 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:32.250
 quick here you can play in the clippings 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.650
 of time therefore if you have ten minutes you 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.840
 make a level a different medium helped 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:40.080
 so a few people is that little game 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:42.750
 that that goes to solve the problems of 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.990
 time especially so it's not the game 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:48.510
 and you have to look for the server to do tried 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:51.660
 the single player in peace in 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:53.850
 definitive is a game that is worth that 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:56.190
 which especially costs if you find it in 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:58.200
 discount in short because it could 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:59.940
 like he died as entertain in 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.560
 so very bland a lot 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.390
 quiet however it is not a 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:07.790
 bad game so if you find it at 

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:07.790
 low price accuse us of making him worry
