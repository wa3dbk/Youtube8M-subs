00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
and yeah it's tree x 7.9 solar business

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.009 
and yeah it's tree x 7.9 solar business
are<00:00:25.019> directly<00:00:25.410> on<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.740> floor<00:00:26.510> which<00:00:27.510> is<00:00:27.539> just

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
are directly on the floor which is just

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.250 
are directly on the floor which is just
super<00:00:28.410> compact<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:29.449> yeah<00:00:30.449> this<00:00:30.900> is<00:00:30.960> its

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
super compact and yeah this is its

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:38.180 
super compact and yeah this is its
closest<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:32.960> this<00:00:33.960> is<00:00:34.170> opening<00:00:36.500> so<00:00:37.500> pretty

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
closest and this is opening so pretty

hope you like it um this far with this
piston<00:00:47.480> yeah<00:00:48.480> settle<00:00:49.379> sluicey<00:00:50.190> quick<00:00:50.489> came<00:00:50.730> up

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
piston yeah settle sluicey quick came up

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.810 
piston yeah settle sluicey quick came up
with<00:00:51.059> that<00:00:53.120> we<00:00:54.120> were<00:00:54.300> just<00:00:54.329> playing<00:00:54.960> on<00:00:55.350> the

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
with that we were just playing on the

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.490 
with that we were just playing on the
Redstone<00:00:56.820> innovation<00:00:57.390> server<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.989> he<00:00:58.230> said

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
Redstone innovation server and he said

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.000 
Redstone innovation server and he said
like<00:00:59.039> I've<00:00:59.609> made<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.270> back<00:01:00.899> but<00:01:01.350> we<00:01:01.620> are<00:01:01.770> to

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
like I've made it back but we are to

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.060 
like I've made it back but we are to
battery<00:01:02.399> door<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.910> yeah<00:01:03.570> so<00:01:04.559> this<00:01:04.769> thing<00:01:05.040> is

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
battery door and yeah so this thing is

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.000 
battery door and yeah so this thing is
basically<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.210> same<00:01:06.510> as<00:01:06.780> what<00:01:07.439> I<00:01:07.500> did<00:01:07.770> in<00:01:07.979> my

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
basically the same as what I did in my

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.120 
basically the same as what I did in my
first<00:01:08.520> two<00:01:09.000> three<00:01:09.299> by<00:01:09.420> three<00:01:09.659> doors<00:01:10.010> well<00:01:11.010> it's

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
first two three by three doors well it's

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.450 
first two three by three doors well it's
just<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.490> lot<00:01:11.640> more<00:01:11.820> compact<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:13.130> yeah<00:01:14.130> so

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
just a lot more compact and yeah so

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.090 
just a lot more compact and yeah so
thanks<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.090> him<00:01:16.340> so<00:01:17.340> basically<00:01:18.740> that's<00:01:19.740> all<00:01:20.070> I

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
thanks to him so basically that's all I

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.789 
thanks to him so basically that's all I
wanted<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.549> say<00:01:21.200> about<00:01:22.200> this<00:01:22.560> thing<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:24.799> what

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
wanted to say about this thing and what

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.249 
wanted to say about this thing and what
it<00:01:25.920> does<00:01:26.070> is<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.570> principle<00:01:27.570> once<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.080> falls

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
it does is it principle once it falls

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.940 
it does is it principle once it falls
and<00:01:28.680> then<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:29.549> turn<00:01:29.759> turns<00:01:30.299> it<00:01:30.450> on<00:01:30.799> because<00:01:31.799> it

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
and then it turn turns it on because it

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.550 
and then it turn turns it on because it
it<00:01:32.310> turns<00:01:33.350> with<00:01:34.350> this<00:01:34.590> torch<00:01:34.799> over<00:01:35.009> here<00:01:36.560> so

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
it turns with this torch over here so

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.690 
it turns with this torch over here so
yeah<00:01:38.420> very<00:01:39.420> neat<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:40.189> this<00:01:41.189> is<00:01:41.310> how<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.460> build

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
yeah very neat and this is how you build

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.359 
yeah very neat and this is how you build
it<00:01:41.880> actually<00:01:42.450> this<00:01:43.259> is<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.590> second<00:01:43.920> recording

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
it actually this is the second recording

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.010 
it actually this is the second recording
for<00:01:44.579> this<00:01:44.810> because<00:01:45.810> yeah<00:01:46.610> someone<00:01:47.899> send<00:01:48.899> me

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
for this because yeah someone send me

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.910 
for this because yeah someone send me
something<00:01:49.409> else<00:01:49.560> wipe<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:51.049> I<00:01:52.049> forgot<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.710> put

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
something else wipe and I forgot to put

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.080 
something else wipe and I forgot to put
this<00:01:53.040> roundup<00:01:53.579> which<00:01:53.939> is<00:01:54.180> pretty<00:01:54.450> stupid<00:01:54.960> um

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
this roundup which is pretty stupid um

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.969 
this roundup which is pretty stupid um
look<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.270> actually<00:01:57.600> going<00:01:58.259> at<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.799> input

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
look and actually going at the input

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.359 
look and actually going at the input
better<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.759> then<00:02:00.380> this<00:02:01.380> mechanism<00:02:02.009> because

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
better and then this mechanism because

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.179 
better and then this mechanism because
of<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.060> white<00:02:03.210> surfaces<00:02:03.689> will<00:02:04.189> completely

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
of the white surfaces will completely

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.400 
of the white surfaces will completely
screw<00:02:05.640> up<00:02:06.500> anyways

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
screw up anyways

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.820 
screw up anyways
this<00:02:09.070> is<00:02:09.190> how<00:02:09.280> you<00:02:09.340> build<00:02:09.580> this<00:02:09.970> is<00:02:10.180> the

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
this is how you build this is the

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.600 
this is how you build this is the
starting<00:02:11.910> part<00:02:13.320> and<00:02:14.320> then<00:02:14.620> the<00:02:15.070> two<00:02:15.280> torches

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
starting part and then the two torches

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.000 
starting part and then the two torches
and<00:02:16.110> another<00:02:17.760> like<00:02:18.760> so<00:02:19.030> and<00:02:19.930> then<00:02:20.620> you<00:02:20.830> can

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
and another like so and then you can

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.320 
and another like so and then you can
place<00:02:21.310> your<00:02:21.460> double<00:02:21.790> piston<00:02:21.970> extender<00:02:22.210> and

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
place your double piston extender and

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.780 
place your double piston extender and
this<00:02:25.330> is<00:02:25.630> without<00:02:26.320> distortion<00:02:26.950> already<00:02:27.250> this

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
this is without distortion already this

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.400 
this is without distortion already this
is<00:02:27.970> your<00:02:28.710> closing<00:02:29.710> mechanism<00:02:30.270> it's<00:02:31.410> super

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
is your closing mechanism it's super

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:38.490 
is your closing mechanism it's super
compact<00:02:34.230> so<00:02:35.230> that's<00:02:35.440> its<00:02:35.590> closed<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:38.170> it's<00:02:38.350> it

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
compact so that's its closed and it's it

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.710 
compact so that's its closed and it's it
almost<00:02:39.130> of<00:02:39.370> you<00:02:39.610> just<00:02:39.880> need<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:40.150> double

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
almost of you just need the double

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.770 
almost of you just need the double
extender<00:02:40.900> at<00:02:41.260> this<00:02:41.380> point<00:02:42.030> so<00:02:43.030> in<00:02:43.270> order<00:02:43.420> to<00:02:43.570> do

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
extender at this point so in order to do

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.930 
extender at this point so in order to do
that<00:02:43.960> we<00:02:44.200> need<00:02:44.230> the<00:02:44.440> falling<00:02:45.070> edge<00:02:45.190> detector

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
that we need the falling edge detector

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.650 
that we need the falling edge detector
which<00:02:46.600> you<00:02:46.750> can<00:02:46.900> do<00:02:47.050> like<00:02:47.230> this<00:02:48.330> going<00:02:49.330> this

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
which you can do like this going this

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.500 
which you can do like this going this
block<00:02:50.400> and<00:02:51.400> cutting<00:02:52.210> off<00:02:52.360> its<00:02:52.690> power<00:02:53.190> itself

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
block and cutting off its power itself

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.710 
block and cutting off its power itself
and<00:02:56.010> then<00:02:57.010> I<00:02:57.040> repeat<00:02:57.580> on<00:02:57.700> this<00:02:57.880> side<00:02:58.120> turn<00:02:58.480> into

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
and then I repeat on this side turn into

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.350 
and then I repeat on this side turn into
this<00:02:58.840> block<00:02:59.140> put<00:03:00.010> your<00:03:00.130> redstone<00:03:00.400> on<00:03:01.030> this

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
this block put your redstone on this

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.680 
this block put your redstone on this
side<00:03:01.600> and<00:03:02.130> then<00:03:03.130> that<00:03:03.700> one's<00:03:03.910> into<00:03:04.270> this<00:03:04.390> block

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
side and then that one's into this block

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.010 
side and then that one's into this block
and<00:03:05.050> this<00:03:05.530> box<00:03:05.770> go<00:03:06.010> to<00:03:06.070> have<00:03:06.280> a<00:03:06.310> talking<00:03:06.610> top

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
and this box go to have a talking top

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.220 
and this box go to have a talking top
and<00:03:08.020> a<00:03:08.260> torch<00:03:08.590> on<00:03:08.710> the<00:03:08.830> side<00:03:09.300> and<00:03:10.300> this<00:03:10.930> store

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
and a torch on the side and this store

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.949 
and a torch on the side and this store
just<00:03:11.260> going<00:03:11.710> to<00:03:11.800> power<00:03:12.420> these<00:03:13.420> two<00:03:13.660> repeaters

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
just going to power these two repeaters

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.940 
just going to power these two repeaters
and<00:03:14.370> this<00:03:15.370> store<00:03:15.580> just<00:03:15.790> go<00:03:15.970> to<00:03:16.030> power<00:03:16.950> this

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
and this store just go to power this

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.180 
and this store just go to power this
dust<00:03:18.250> is<00:03:18.580> less<00:03:19.060> than<00:03:19.240> this<00:03:19.420> stuff<00:03:19.660> and<00:03:20.230> this

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
dust is less than this stuff and this

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.490 
dust is less than this stuff and this
redstone<00:03:21.550> still<00:03:22.000> its<00:03:22.090> power<00:03:22.330> this<00:03:23.110> repeater

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
redstone still its power this repeater

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.910 
redstone still its power this repeater
and<00:03:24.420> this<00:03:25.420> walk<00:03:25.860> so<00:03:26.860> that<00:03:27.310> is<00:03:27.550> basically<00:03:28.920> off

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
and this walk so that is basically off

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.130 
and this walk so that is basically off
the<00:03:29.980> door<00:03:30.820> we<00:03:31.420> just<00:03:31.660> need<00:03:31.810> the<00:03:31.840> slight

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
the door we just need the slight

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:38.910 
the door we just need the slight
distance<00:03:32.410> but<00:03:32.920> let's<00:03:33.400> give<00:03:33.580> it<00:03:33.610> a<00:03:33.700> shot<00:03:37.920> so

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
distance but let's give it a shot so

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.310 
distance but let's give it a shot so
that's<00:03:39.040> pretty<00:03:39.280> quick<00:03:39.610> and<00:03:39.870> I<00:03:40.870> have<00:03:41.020> to<00:03:41.140> like

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
that's pretty quick and I have to like

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:48.420 
that's pretty quick and I have to like
it<00:03:43.470> put<00:03:44.470> aside<00:03:44.560> this<00:03:46.110> just<00:03:47.110> do<00:03:47.290> this<00:03:47.530> this

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
it put aside this just do this this

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.010 
it put aside this just do this this
business<00:03:48.880> going<00:03:49.030> to<00:03:49.180> be<00:03:49.239> powered<00:03:49.600> by<00:03:49.780> this

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:50.020 
business going to be powered by this

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:56.930 
business going to be powered by this
torch<00:03:50.580> and<00:03:51.660> this<00:03:52.660> will<00:03:52.900> just<00:03:53.080> run<00:03:53.320> up<00:03:54.239> and<00:03:55.239> then

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
torch and this will just run up and then

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.000 
torch and this will just run up and then
this<00:03:57.940> is<00:03:58.120> going<00:03:58.330> to<00:03:58.600> bring<00:03:59.140> down<00:03:59.470> to<00:03:59.770> the<00:03:59.920> other

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
this is going to bring down to the other

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:08.070 
this is going to bring down to the other
side<00:04:00.780> like<00:04:01.780> so<00:04:03.150> and<00:04:05.430> then<00:04:06.690> underneath<00:04:07.690> this

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
side like so and then underneath this

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.570 
side like so and then underneath this
block<00:04:10.170> and<00:04:11.170> it<00:04:11.290> takes<00:04:11.530> real<00:04:11.800> or<00:04:12.190> something

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
block and it takes real or something

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.720 
block and it takes real or something
like<00:04:12.730> that<00:04:12.959> to<00:04:13.959> update<00:04:14.440> new<00:04:15.250> piston

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
like that to update new piston

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.400 
like that to update new piston
underneath<00:04:17.190> so<00:04:18.190> yeah<00:04:18.489> then<00:04:19.060> for

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
underneath so yeah then for

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.930 
underneath so yeah then for
disgusting<00:04:22.020> this<00:04:23.020> is<00:04:23.170> optional<00:04:23.380> but<00:04:23.920> you<00:04:24.700> can

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
disgusting this is optional but you can

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.490 
disgusting this is optional but you can
give<00:04:25.300> this<00:04:25.950> kind<00:04:26.950> of<00:04:27.160> a<00:04:27.310> weird<00:04:27.580> thing<00:04:28.000> to<00:04:28.500> make

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
give this kind of a weird thing to make

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.550 
give this kind of a weird thing to make
it<00:04:29.740> go<00:04:30.010> at<00:04:30.310> the<00:04:30.370> point<00:04:30.700> that<00:04:31.300> the<00:04:32.050> middle<00:04:32.380> block

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
it go at the point that the middle block

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.220 
it go at the point that the middle block
is<00:04:32.740> taken<00:04:33.130> and<00:04:33.280> that<00:04:33.540> the<00:04:34.540> middle<00:04:34.750> block<00:04:34.930> comes

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.230 
is taken and that the middle block comes

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:40.350 
is taken and that the middle block comes
up<00:04:35.460> so<00:04:36.460> that's<00:04:36.850> pretty<00:04:37.090> cool<00:04:38.670> and<00:04:39.670> you<00:04:40.090> can<00:04:40.120> do

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
up so that's pretty cool and you can do

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.960 
up so that's pretty cool and you can do
that<00:04:40.510> by<00:04:40.690> placing<00:04:41.290> two<00:04:41.740> repeaters<00:04:42.520> at<00:04:42.730> your

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
that by placing two repeaters at your

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.110 
that by placing two repeaters at your
side<00:04:43.320> one<00:04:44.320> of<00:04:44.440> them<00:04:44.590> in<00:04:44.710> two<00:04:44.920> and<00:04:45.130> one<00:04:45.880> of<00:04:45.970> them

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
side one of them in two and one of them

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.470 
side one of them in two and one of them
on<00:04:46.270> story<00:04:47.020> ticks<00:04:47.400> and<00:04:48.400> it'll<00:04:49.150> give<00:04:49.270> this

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:49.480 
on story ticks and it'll give this

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:55.430 
on story ticks and it'll give this
effect<00:04:51.630> so<00:04:52.630> these<00:04:52.930> go<00:04:53.170> exactly<00:04:53.680> the<00:04:53.860> same<00:04:54.130> time

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
effect so these go exactly the same time

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.950 
effect so these go exactly the same time
and<00:04:56.440> then<00:04:56.860> like<00:04:57.070> that<00:04:57.280> so<00:04:57.820> I<00:04:58.090> thought<00:04:58.660> that<00:04:58.720> was

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
and then like that so I thought that was

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.220 
and then like that so I thought that was
really<00:04:59.230> cool<00:04:59.970> but<00:05:00.970> yeah<00:05:01.450> if<00:05:01.750> you<00:05:01.930> want<00:05:02.110> to
