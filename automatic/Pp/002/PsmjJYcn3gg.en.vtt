00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
they look a little bit different but the

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.780 
they look a little bit different but the
reality<00:01:59.579> is<00:01:59.610> is<00:02:00.680> I'm<00:02:01.680> still<00:02:02.009> on<00:02:02.310> track<00:02:02.579> and

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
reality is is I'm still on track and

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.639 
reality is is I'm still on track and
nine<00:02:02.939> pounds<00:02:03.329> is<00:02:03.420> a<00:02:03.450> lot<00:02:03.540> of<00:02:04.079> weight<00:02:04.320> to<00:02:04.350> lose

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
nine pounds is a lot of weight to lose

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.940 
nine pounds is a lot of weight to lose
so<00:02:05.549> um<00:02:06.110> for<00:02:07.110> some<00:02:07.259> reason<00:02:07.500> this<00:02:07.590> whole<00:02:07.740> month

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
so um for some reason this whole month

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.169 
so um for some reason this whole month
that<00:02:08.129> kind<00:02:08.340> of<00:02:08.399> could<00:02:08.610> get<00:02:08.789> that<00:02:08.910> out<00:02:09.060> of<00:02:09.090> my

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
that kind of could get that out of my

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.770 
that kind of could get that out of my
head<00:02:10.009> we're<00:02:11.009> in<00:02:11.580> one<00:02:11.879> hand<00:02:12.150> I<00:02:12.300> thought<00:02:12.540> that<00:02:12.720> I

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
head we're in one hand I thought that I

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.650 
head we're in one hand I thought that I
was<00:02:12.959> okay<00:02:13.319> with

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
was okay with

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.300 
was okay with
nine-pound<00:02:14.080> loss<00:02:14.170> because<00:02:14.680> it's<00:02:14.860> great<00:02:15.130> and

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
nine-pound loss because it's great and

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.880 
nine-pound loss because it's great and
forward<00:02:15.850> movement<00:02:16.440> it's<00:02:17.440> really<00:02:17.680> all<00:02:17.800> that

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
forward movement it's really all that

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.790 
forward movement it's really all that
matters<00:02:17.950> you<00:02:18.670> know<00:02:18.790> I<00:02:18.820> was<00:02:19.420> talking<00:02:19.720> to<00:02:19.800> to

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
matters you know I was talking to to

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.310 
matters you know I was talking to to
becca<00:02:21.400> earlier<00:02:21.970> if<00:02:22.900> you're<00:02:23.080> not<00:02:23.170> following

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
becca earlier if you're not following

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.870 
becca earlier if you're not following
her<00:02:23.620> journey<00:02:23.800> you<00:02:24.010> need<00:02:24.160> to<00:02:24.340> because<00:02:24.670> she's

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
her journey you need to because she's

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.200 
her journey you need to because she's
just<00:02:25.680> ridiculous<00:02:26.680> but<00:02:27.490> you<00:02:27.850> know<00:02:27.940> I<00:02:27.970> said<00:02:28.180> to

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
just ridiculous but you know I said to

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.210 
just ridiculous but you know I said to
her<00:02:28.390> you<00:02:28.570> know<00:02:28.690> always<00:02:28.900> always<00:02:29.500> be<00:02:29.890> moving

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
her you know always always be moving

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.410 
her you know always always be moving
forward<00:02:31.440> and<00:02:32.440> that's<00:02:32.830> kind<00:02:33.100> of<00:02:33.160> my<00:02:33.420> mantra

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
forward and that's kind of my mantra

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.680 
forward and that's kind of my mantra
right<00:02:34.600> now<00:02:34.810> is<00:02:35.580> that<00:02:36.580> if<00:02:36.730> you<00:02:36.850> put<00:02:37.060> one<00:02:37.090> foot<00:02:37.540> in

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
right now is that if you put one foot in

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.230 
right now is that if you put one foot in
front<00:02:37.750> of<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:37.960> other<00:02:39.060> you're<00:02:40.060> eventually

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
front of the other you're eventually

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.480 
front of the other you're eventually
going<00:02:40.570> to<00:02:40.630> get<00:02:40.810> to<00:02:40.960> where<00:02:41.140> you<00:02:41.290> need<00:02:41.320> to<00:02:41.620> go<00:02:41.650> but

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
going to get to where you need to go but

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.150 
going to get to where you need to go but
if<00:02:42.580> you<00:02:42.670> stop<00:02:43.110> for<00:02:44.110> worse<00:02:44.320> you<00:02:44.530> move<00:02:44.710> backwards

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
if you stop for worse you move backwards

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.070 
if you stop for worse you move backwards
you'll<00:02:45.430> never<00:02:45.640> get<00:02:45.910> there<00:02:46.180> you<00:02:46.720> know<00:02:46.840> I<00:02:46.870> had<00:02:47.050> a

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
to get there but you're eventually going

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.190 
to get there but you're eventually going
to<00:03:30.730> get<00:03:30.850> there<00:03:31.030> and<00:03:31.480> that's<00:03:31.630> the<00:03:31.750> same<00:03:31.900> kind<00:03:32.080> of

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
to get there and that's the same kind of

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.930
