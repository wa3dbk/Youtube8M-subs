00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.929
 we are going to eat some potatoes 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.849
 riojana and for that we need about 4 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.859
 medium potatoes cut down like 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.109
 you are seeing cut to pieces here 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:23.039
 we have a medium choricero pepper 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:25.680
 leek half red pepper two sausages 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.230
 counted slices as you are watching two 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.720

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.610
 bay leaves to see this recipe 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.920
 it really has onions but to me 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.890
 I like it much more with leek two 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.640
 whole tomatoes as you are watching half 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.350
 white wine cup cumin oil 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.230
 olive and salt 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:50.530
 Well having all this and the 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:53.320
 rest is very easy to despres fire and you 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.300
 we give maximum power the hot pot 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.309
 What we do is take three 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.409
 tablespoons of olive oil and now what 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:02.670
 what we do with the whole dish that has been 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:02.670
 prepared is to throw everything 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:10.060
 but let's fry the 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.729
 ingredients or noise all over strong fire 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:17.880
 for a couple of minutes we are going to 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:21.259
 toss the potatoes, stir a little 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.259
 we add a small glass of water 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:29.140
 so you do not know to talk about love 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.140
 and we are going to cut the tomatoes 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:44.439
 the tomato but we add the two tomatoes 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.649
 I'm not very skilled with the knife going very 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:50.890
 quick I advise you to remove the pot 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:53.560
 so that not those who tell me that 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.840
 We are always cooking on a high heat 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.240
 we should sautÃ© for a couple of 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.720
 minutes past the time what we do is 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:04.200
 pour the white wine and we'll let 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.200
 reduce 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.179
 the wine has reduced what we do 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:13.000
 add a little cumin that will be 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.270
 as a tablespoon or less than that of 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.270
 coffee 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:23.750
 a little salt we will add three 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:26.440
 cups of water as you are watching 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.440
 a 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:34.580
 and 3 we move a little bit in the moment that 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.560
 boil let's leave the judge during 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.870
 about 5 minutes to find out where those 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.200
 five minutes and what we are going to do is 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.200
 cover 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.630
 and 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:55.780
 we set it to 2 and lower the fire to the 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:59.990
 half have already spent 10 minutes 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:02.330
 we put out the fire and we take all the 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.520
 Steam from the pot at the time you get off 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.850
 tito type this we can already open the 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:11.420
 pot and we have the chips to what 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:14.360

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:17.660
 minutes over high heat so that the broth 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.560
 thick and eyeing him is not going to be 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.140
 that you stay 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.120
 after five minutes we went down the 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.910
 fire and let's let it settle 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.040
