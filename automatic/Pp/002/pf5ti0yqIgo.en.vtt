00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
really happy and it sounds like they

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.270 
really happy and it sounds like they
can't<00:02:01.140> really<00:02:01.380> do<00:02:01.560> much<00:02:01.590> with<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.979> current

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
can't really do much with the current

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.819 
can't really do much with the current
system<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:02.850> that's<00:02:03.329> why<00:02:03.630> we<00:02:03.840> that<00:02:04.530> gateway

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
system and that's why we that gateway

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.380 
system and that's why we that gateway
the<00:02:04.979> card<00:02:05.280> is<00:02:05.460> coming<00:02:05.729> out<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.000> it's<00:02:06.149> kind<00:02:06.299> of

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
the card is coming out and it's kind of

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.600 
the card is coming out and it's kind of
like<00:02:06.450> yeah<00:02:07.079> it's<00:02:07.439> just<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.710> same<00:02:07.950> as<00:02:08.099> it<00:02:08.250> has

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
like yeah it's just the same as it has

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.309 
like yeah it's just the same as it has
Panthers<00:02:08.970> in<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.149> fog<00:02:09.360> it<00:02:09.810> sounds<00:02:10.110> like<00:02:10.170> they

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
Panthers in the fog it sounds like they

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.970 
Panthers in the fog it sounds like they
can't<00:02:10.590> really<00:02:10.770> do<00:02:10.950> much<00:02:10.979> more<00:02:11.640> with

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
can't really do much more with

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.979 
can't really do much more with
current<00:02:12.310> system<00:02:12.670> so<00:02:13.150> that's<00:02:13.390> why<00:02:13.629> they're

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
current system so that's why they're

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.289 
current system so that's why they're
creating<00:02:14.620> a<00:02:14.739> whole<00:02:15.010> new<00:02:15.040> engine<00:02:15.459> a<00:02:15.790> whole<00:02:16.060> new

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:16.299 
creating a whole new engine a whole new

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:18.780 
creating a whole new engine a whole new
experience<00:02:16.659> a<00:02:16.989> whole<00:02:17.110> new<00:02:17.260> game<00:02:17.470> for<00:02:18.459> the<00:02:18.580> game

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
experience a whole new game for the game

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:23.379 
that's what I think it is I reckon it's

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:26.520 
that's what I think it is I reckon it's
going<00:02:23.470> to<00:02:23.560> be<00:02:23.650> great<00:02:23.950> and<00:02:24.220> I<00:02:25.090> can<00:02:26.080> see<00:02:26.290> what

they're doing I can see which way they

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:30.809 
they're doing I can see which way they
try<00:02:29.140> to<00:02:29.170> aim<00:02:29.440> and<00:02:29.799> I'm<00:02:30.129> really<00:02:30.430> looking

new AI it's a fight against and things

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.120 
new AI it's a fight against and things
like<00:03:21.940> that<00:03:22.000> I<00:03:22.329> can't<00:03:23.139> see<00:03:23.440> problems<00:03:23.799> with<00:03:23.919> that

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
like that I can't see problems with that

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.659 
like that I can't see problems with that
as<00:03:24.280> long<00:03:24.430> as<00:03:24.459> they<00:03:24.730> don't<00:03:24.880> mess<00:03:25.329> it<00:03:25.359> up<00:03:25.569> badly<00:03:26.019> I

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:26.669 
as long as they don't mess it up badly I

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:29.729 
as long as they don't mess it up badly I
can't<00:03:27.669> see<00:03:28.000> you<00:03:28.359> know<00:03:28.480> I<00:03:28.720> can't<00:03:29.230> see<00:03:29.410> anything

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
can't see you know I can't see anything

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:32.190 
can't see you know I can't see anything
wrong<00:03:30.010> with<00:03:30.069> that<00:03:30.310> I<00:03:30.370> don't<00:03:30.690> you<00:03:31.690> know<00:03:31.810> I'm

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
wrong with that I don't you know I'm

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.870 
wrong with that I don't you know I'm
sure<00:03:32.410> they'll<00:03:32.889> make<00:03:33.069> a<00:03:33.099> mistake<00:03:33.549> here<00:03:33.790> or

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
sure they'll make a mistake here or

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.580 
sure they'll make a mistake here or
there<00:03:34.060> but<00:03:34.239> I<00:03:34.269> think<00:03:34.720> overall<00:03:35.109> we're<00:03:35.470> gonna

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590

that's<00:03:57.419> that<00:03:58.419> remains<00:03:58.780> to<00:03:58.870> be<00:03:58.930> seen<00:03:58.989> but<00:03:59.859> in<00:04:00.400> my

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:00.579 
that's that remains to be seen but in my

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:02.970 
that's that remains to be seen but in my
opinion<00:04:00.730> at<00:04:01.239> least<00:04:01.660> they're<00:04:01.900> trying<00:04:02.049> to<00:04:02.530> do

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
opinion at least they're trying to do

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.159 
opinion at least they're trying to do
something<00:04:03.010> they're<00:04:03.790> trying<00:04:04.030> to<00:04:04.150> give<00:04:05.019> us<00:04:05.139> a

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:05.169 
something they're trying to give us a

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
things that are wrong with the current

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:13.470
