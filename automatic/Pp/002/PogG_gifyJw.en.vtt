00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 so hello today i do a 1 degree 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.870
 capone 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:10.190
 For this we need cream of sugar 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:15.299
 just what capone and me the milk 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:18.690
 turn stew in about a year medium 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:21.680
 big pot then what you and the 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.680
 sugar equal to it 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:35.530
 We'll do it all first 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:39.430
 and seven who slowly make me boil 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:43.720
 as soon as the milk boils we make the 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:48.150
 stove or gas and do 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.150
 then mascarpone cheese into it 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.600
 We stir them first nice 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.850
 then it dissolves well and if 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:04.250
 that happened, let's cook it again 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.250
 milk up shortly 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:13.590
 stir stir stir so that 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.590
 really good dissolves well 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.509
 and bring it to a boil again if that 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:22.840
 has happened 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:26.500
 put the stove completely out and this 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.509
 mascarpone milk mass calm 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.520
 make or not calm 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:32.520
 but let cool 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:48.159
 so and now the whipped cream we will 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.940
 the whipped cream is not completely stiff 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:56.130
 beat but half stiff as that 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.130
 looks like you will see the same 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.640
 it is so unevenly finished and looks like that 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.640
 then it out 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.300
 we go in the half stiff cream in 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:27.760
 the mascarpone milk mass and stir 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.760
 that it down 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.519
 Now I feel the mass in a form 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.000
 In other words, this form has a content 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:48.000
 of one and a half meters and with one 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.459
 cover course everything is still 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.330
 nice times and then into the 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.330
 done freezer 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:18.560
 After about 20 minutes I picked up 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:20.870
 this price mass out again it is 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.660
 no real is still liquid 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.300
 but I stir that up again 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:30.370
 so that no crystals form and 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.370
 that remains reasonably supple 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:40.460
 after another 20 minutes I repeat 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:42.470
 this process again and that is done 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:45.980
 you can actually do it two more three 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:48.760
 then repeat that all quiet the 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.050
 leave many times and do nothing more 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.700
 so it gets to decorate it 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.650
 Of course, it is up to each one to decide for himself 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:58.190
 I choose now frozen deep 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:01.400
 had fruits and I will then 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:04.040
 now with the decorate 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.930
 I have to say that it is a basis 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.480
 That means you can of course chocolate 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.340
 A goalie selling preparation what you can 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.640
 you want and what you can do 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.680
 in it raisins ride or schokostreusel 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.840
 whatever it is for everyone 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.040
 leave 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.750
 and I have just now a form 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.850
 chosen so I can show how 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.590
 that looks like and I have 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.690
 I chose these fruits I wish 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.570
 you tried a good try it is 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:32.230
 very easy and very fast and up 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.230
 soon bye
