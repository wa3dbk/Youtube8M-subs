Monica<00:02:23.130> pack<00:02:23.989> so<00:02:24.989> I<00:02:25.049> couldn't<00:02:25.590> decide<00:02:25.920> between

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
Monica pack so I couldn't decide between

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.780 
Monica pack so I couldn't decide between
the<00:02:27.590> cloud<00:02:28.590> ones<00:02:28.980> or<00:02:30.470> the<00:02:31.470> sunset<00:02:31.799> ones<00:02:32.340> so<00:02:32.760> I

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
the cloud ones or the sunset ones so I

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.220 
the cloud ones or the sunset ones so I
just<00:02:33.090> I<00:02:33.420> got<00:02:33.630> both

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
just I got both

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.550 
just I got both
and<00:02:34.319> I<00:02:34.890> kept<00:02:35.220> both<00:02:35.540> and<00:02:36.540> I<00:02:36.630> liked<00:02:36.840> both<00:02:37.049> of<00:02:37.110> them

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
and I kept both and I liked both of them

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.150 
and I kept both and I liked both of them
I<00:02:39.170> didn't<00:02:40.170> think<00:02:40.319> that<00:02:40.590> these<00:02:40.830> were<00:02:41.040> as

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
I didn't think that these were as

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.130 
I didn't think that these were as
vibrant<00:02:41.580> as<00:02:41.760> they<00:02:41.970> looked<00:02:42.150> in<00:02:42.299> photos<00:02:42.750> but<00:02:43.110> I

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
vibrant as they looked in photos but I

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.440 
vibrant as they looked in photos but I
guess<00:02:43.500> they<00:02:44.010> love<00:02:44.340> to<00:02:44.519> photoshop<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.239> crap

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450
