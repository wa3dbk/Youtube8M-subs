really think this is one of the better

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.000 
really think this is one of the better
levels<00:00:27.630> for<00:00:27.810> Fox<00:00:28.050> in<00:00:28.199> this<00:00:28.320> matchup<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:28.890> we'll

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
levels for Fox in this matchup and we'll

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.450 
levels for Fox in this matchup and we'll
see<00:00:29.160> how<00:00:29.220> it<00:00:29.250> plays<00:00:29.340> out<00:00:30.769> Isaiah<00:00:31.769> has<00:00:32.160> lost

believe<00:00:33.270> his<00:00:33.450> last<00:00:33.750> two<00:00:34.500> or<00:00:34.530> three<00:00:34.680> sets

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.080 
believe his last two or three sets
against<00:00:35.700> PC<00:00:36.180> so<00:00:36.930> this<00:00:37.079> is<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.230> matchup<00:00:37.500> that<00:00:37.739> uh

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
against PC so this is a matchup that uh

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.869 
against PC so this is a matchup that uh
it's<00:00:39.090> almost<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.420> small<00:00:39.660> rivalry<00:00:40.640> and<00:00:41.640> it's
