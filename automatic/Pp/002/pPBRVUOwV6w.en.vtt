computer and set up a second layer of

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.120 
computer and set up a second layer of
spikes<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.420> that<00:02:00.630> is<00:02:00.810> quite<00:02:01.200> excellent<00:02:01.710> i'm

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
spikes and that is quite excellent i'm

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.649

into hatter i think i can resist any
attacks<00:02:07.530> on<00:02:07.799> his<00:02:08.069> end<00:02:08.250> goes<00:02:08.819> for<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.090> try

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
attacks on his end goes for the try

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
considering its resistive he goes for

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.479 
considering its resistive he goes for
another<00:02:14.290> try<00:02:14.530> attack<00:02:14.770> I'm<00:02:14.980> hoping<00:02:15.280> you<00:02:15.459> know

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
get up my stealth rocks and so now I'm

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.449 
get up my stealth rocks and so now I'm
going<00:02:20.290> to<00:02:20.349> be<00:02:20.440> able<00:02:20.500> to<00:02:20.680> set<00:02:20.830> up<00:02:20.920> my<00:02:20.950> strategy

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
going to be able to set up my strategy

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.220 
going to be able to set up my strategy
of<00:02:21.640> dragon<00:02:22.120> tailing<00:02:22.480> and<00:02:22.630> doing<00:02:22.900> massive

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
massive amounts of damage just through

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.880 
massive amounts of damage just through
recoil<00:02:25.750> I<00:02:25.900> get<00:02:26.050> frozen<00:02:26.319> but<00:02:26.590> I<00:02:26.620> thought

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
recoil I get frozen but I thought

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.990 
recoil I get frozen but I thought
immediately<00:02:27.310> so<00:02:28.270> kind<00:02:29.050> of<00:02:29.110> a<00:02:29.200> wash<00:02:29.410> their

kill today really can't do anything

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.160 
kill today really can't do anything
against<00:03:29.380> him<00:03:29.470> he<00:03:29.859> uses<00:03:30.250> a<00:03:30.489> stone<00:03:31.359> edge<00:03:31.510> and<00:03:31.780> it

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
against him he uses a stone edge and it

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.949 
against him he uses a stone edge and it
doesn't<00:03:32.470> actually<00:03:32.560> do<00:03:32.829> that<00:03:32.980> much<00:03:33.220> damage<00:03:33.250> and

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
doesn't actually do that much damage and

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.180 
doesn't actually do that much damage and
more<00:03:34.959> importantly<00:03:35.320> he's<00:03:35.470> late<00:03:35.709> for<00:03:35.739> band<00:03:36.040> so

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
more importantly he's late for band so

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.610 
more importantly he's late for band so
I'm<00:03:36.280> thinking<00:03:36.579> can<00:03:37.299> I<00:03:37.329> actually<00:03:37.660> life<00:03:38.350> orb
