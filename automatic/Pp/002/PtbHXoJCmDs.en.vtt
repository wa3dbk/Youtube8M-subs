hey Nick good to have you here today
with<00:01:51.550> me<00:01:51.760> to<00:01:52.000> help<00:01:52.330> me<00:01:53.340> go<00:01:54.340> through<00:01:54.640> our<00:01:54.790> gecko

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
with me to help me go through our gecko

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.320 
with me to help me go through our gecko
reims<00:01:56.130> but<00:01:57.130> quite<00:01:57.370> a<00:01:57.400> bit<00:01:57.610> bigger<00:01:57.790> actually

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
reims but quite a bit bigger actually

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.500 
reims but quite a bit bigger actually
compared<00:01:58.840> to<00:01:58.960> last<00:01:59.170> year<00:01:59.500> we've<00:02:00.340> added<00:02:00.700> sizes

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 
compared to last year we've added sizes

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.290 
compared to last year we've added sizes
we've<00:02:01.990> added<00:02:02.260> various<00:02:03.130> technology<00:02:03.820> so<00:02:04.150> we

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
we've added various technology so we

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.140 
we've added various technology so we
have<00:02:04.450> five<00:02:04.780> gecko<00:02:05.200> sizes<00:02:05.680> now<00:02:05.890> in<00:02:06.820> three

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
have five gecko sizes now in three

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.029 
have five gecko sizes now in three
different<00:02:07.360> technologies<00:02:08.170> we<00:02:08.530> started<00:02:08.920> off

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
different technologies we started off

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.510 
different technologies we started off
with<00:02:09.220> two<00:02:09.459> boards<00:02:10.050> last<00:02:11.050> year<00:02:11.350> had<00:02:12.190> a<00:02:12.220> late

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
with two boards last year had a late

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.570 
with two boards last year had a late
release<00:02:13.240> on<00:02:13.570> the<00:02:13.720> third<00:02:13.959> size<00:02:14.340> well<00:02:15.340> why<00:02:15.520> is

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
release on the third size well why is

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:16.680 
release on the third size well why is
that<00:02:15.880> what<00:02:16.060> you<00:02:16.209> think

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
that what you think

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.580 
that what you think
simply<00:02:17.470> it's<00:02:17.620> been<00:02:17.860> such<00:02:18.070> a<00:02:18.100> huge<00:02:18.370> success<00:02:18.700> and

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
simply it's been such a huge success and

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.560 
simply it's been such a huge success and
we<00:02:20.590> see<00:02:20.830> a<00:02:20.860> great<00:02:21.130> potential<00:02:21.820> in<00:02:21.940> this<00:02:22.120> kind<00:02:22.480> of

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
we see a great potential in this kind of

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.270 
we see a great potential in this kind of
shape<00:02:22.630> so<00:02:23.320> here<00:02:23.560> you<00:02:23.680> see<00:02:23.890> the<00:02:24.040> three

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
shape so here you see the three

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.910 
shape so here you see the three
different<00:02:24.910> options<00:02:25.330> and<00:02:25.720> technology<00:02:26.320> where

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
different options and technology where

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.460 
different options and technology where
the<00:02:27.040> hrs<00:02:27.640> version<00:02:28.150> we<00:02:29.020> have<00:02:29.170> a<00:02:29.260> bamboo

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
the hrs version we have a bamboo

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.850 
the hrs version we have a bamboo

bottom the the gecko is not necessarily
a<00:02:45.130> fartist<00:02:45.640> board<00:02:45.880> the<00:02:45.970> world<00:02:46.150> but<00:02:46.360> believe<00:02:46.600> me

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
a fartist board the world but believe me

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.690 
a fartist board the world but believe me
it<00:02:46.810> is<00:02:46.900> very<00:02:46.930> very<00:02:47.410> fast<00:02:47.739> where<00:02:48.370> we<00:02:48.489> said

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
it is very very fast where we said

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.430 
it is very very fast where we said
before<00:02:48.820> about<00:02:49.060> the<00:02:49.450> hawk<00:02:49.630> being<00:02:49.900> a<00:02:50.020> very<00:02:50.200> fast

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
before about the hawk being a very fast

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.050 
before about the hawk being a very fast
Walker<00:02:50.680> line<00:02:50.890> is<00:02:51.010> something<00:02:51.250> we<00:02:51.489> used<00:02:51.730> you

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
Walker line is something we used you

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.460 
Walker line is something we used you
know<00:02:52.120> across<00:02:52.420> a<00:02:52.450> few<00:02:52.750> boards<00:02:53.019> in<00:02:53.110> our<00:02:53.230> range

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
know across a few boards in our range

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.140 
know across a few boards in our range
but<00:02:53.860> the<00:02:54.010> gecko<00:02:54.190> is<00:02:54.459> one<00:02:54.610> of<00:02:54.730> those<00:02:54.850> boards

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
but the gecko is one of those boards

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.570 
but the gecko is one of those boards
well<00:02:56.140> when<00:02:56.290> I<00:02:56.320> started<00:02:56.860> thinking<00:02:57.190> about<00:02:57.250> the

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
well when I started thinking about the

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.080 
well when I started thinking about the
concept<00:02:58.030> okay<00:02:59.070> it's<00:03:00.070> a<00:03:00.130> new<00:03:00.280> concept<00:03:00.760> so<00:03:01.030> you

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
concept okay it's a new concept so you

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.210 
concept okay it's a new concept so you
need<00:03:01.269> a<00:03:01.299> starting<00:03:01.750> point<00:03:01.989> and<00:03:02.620> I<00:03:02.680> thought<00:03:02.860> okay

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
need a starting point and I thought okay

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.240 
need a starting point and I thought okay
what<00:03:03.519> what's<00:03:04.120> the<00:03:04.299> objective<00:03:04.600> to<00:03:04.900> go<00:03:05.049> okay<00:03:05.830> why

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
what what's the objective to go okay why

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.070 
what what's the objective to go okay why
not<00:03:06.280> start<00:03:06.730> with<00:03:06.850> something<00:03:07.269> I<00:03:07.510> know<00:03:07.570> it<00:03:07.810> works

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
not start with something I know it works

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.750 
not start with something I know it works
which<00:03:08.320> is<00:03:08.500> quick<00:03:08.799> and<00:03:08.950> gets<00:03:09.160> you<00:03:09.310> on<00:03:09.340> the<00:03:09.549> goal

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
which is quick and gets you on the goal

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.840 
which is quick and gets you on the goal
quickly<00:03:10.030> as<00:03:10.630> we<00:03:11.170> said<00:03:11.410> on<00:03:11.560> the<00:03:11.680> hop<00:03:11.890> it's<00:03:12.640> our

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
quickly as we said on the hop it's our

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.030 
quickly as we said on the hop it's our
hot<00:03:13.090> rocker<00:03:13.360> line<00:03:13.630> it's<00:03:14.049> proven<00:03:14.530> I<00:03:14.680> know<00:03:14.739> it

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
hot rocker line it's proven I know it

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.220 
hot rocker line it's proven I know it
works<00:03:15.280> so<00:03:16.030> we<00:03:16.150> did<00:03:16.299> the<00:03:16.420> first<00:03:16.450> produce<00:03:17.049> with

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
works so we did the first produce with

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.640 
works so we did the first produce with
that<00:03:17.380> rocker<00:03:17.620> and<00:03:19.049> it's<00:03:20.049> pretty<00:03:20.290> much<00:03:20.440> the

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
that rocker and it's pretty much the

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.490 
that rocker and it's pretty much the
same<00:03:20.860> all<00:03:21.190> the<00:03:21.370> way<00:03:21.519> to<00:03:22.209> here<00:03:22.570> and<00:03:22.720> then<00:03:23.350> it

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
same all the way to here and then it

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.820 
same all the way to here and then it
just<00:03:23.880> adds<00:03:24.880> a<00:03:25.239> little<00:03:25.420> bit<00:03:25.540> of<00:03:25.720> tail<00:03:26.019> lift<00:03:26.290> what

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
just adds a little bit of tail lift what

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.590 
just adds a little bit of tail lift what
does<00:03:27.070> this<00:03:27.280> first<00:03:27.610> of<00:03:27.820> all<00:03:27.970> when<00:03:28.180> you<00:03:28.299> initiate

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
does this first of all when you initiate

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.990 
does this first of all when you initiate
your<00:03:28.930> maneuver<00:03:29.410> you<00:03:29.590> step<00:03:29.860> a<00:03:29.890> little<00:03:30.070> back<00:03:30.519> the

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
your maneuver you step a little back the

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.990 
your maneuver you step a little back the
board<00:03:31.269> obviously<00:03:31.450> turns<00:03:32.049> a<00:03:32.200> lot<00:03:32.320> easier

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
board obviously turns a lot easier

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.370 
board obviously turns a lot easier
secondarily<00:03:34.000> the<00:03:34.360> nice<00:03:34.570> thing<00:03:34.900> is<00:03:34.930> we<00:03:35.200> have<00:03:35.350> a

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
secondarily the nice thing is we have a

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.670 
secondarily the nice thing is we have a
wider<00:03:35.709> board<00:03:36.100> in<00:03:36.250> general<00:03:37.110> it<00:03:38.110> offers<00:03:38.530> you

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
wider board in general it offers you

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.710 
wider board in general it offers you
release<00:03:39.010> so<00:03:39.549> actually<00:03:39.880> the<00:03:40.060> wide<00:03:40.299> board

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
release so actually the wide board

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.539 
release so actually the wide board
doesn't<00:03:41.079> get<00:03:41.320> stuck<00:03:41.560> to<00:03:41.769> the<00:03:41.890> water<00:03:42.100> because

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
doesn't get stuck to the water because

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:44.729 
doesn't get stuck to the water because
of<00:03:42.579> the<00:03:42.880> rocker<00:03:43.239> so<00:03:43.810> we're<00:03:44.019> actually<00:03:44.200> catching

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
of the rocker so we're actually catching

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.830 
of the rocker so we're actually catching
a<00:03:44.829> couple<00:03:45.040> flies<00:03:45.459> here<00:03:45.790> at<00:03:45.910> the<00:03:46.030> same<00:03:46.269> time<00:03:46.299> by

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
a couple flies here at the same time by

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.039 
a couple flies here at the same time by
adding<00:03:47.230> the<00:03:47.650> tail<00:03:47.890> rocker<00:03:48.360> very<00:03:49.360> nice<00:03:49.600> and<00:03:49.900> it

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
adding the tail rocker very nice and it

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:52.380 
adding the tail rocker very nice and it
played<00:03:50.290> out<00:03:50.320> immediately<00:03:51.220> and<00:03:51.730> we<00:03:51.910> knew<00:03:52.030> okay

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
played out immediately and we knew okay

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.289 
played out immediately and we knew okay
this<00:03:52.600> is<00:03:52.750> the<00:03:52.900> way<00:03:53.019> to<00:03:53.079> go<00:03:53.790> on<00:03:54.790> top<00:03:55.090> of<00:03:55.150> that

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
this is the way to go on top of that

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:58.500 
this is the way to go on top of that
what<00:03:56.140> you'll<00:03:56.320> notice<00:03:56.530> obviously<00:03:57.340> the<00:03:58.180> boards

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
what you'll notice obviously the boards

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.900 
what you'll notice obviously the boards
are<00:03:58.660> wide<00:03:58.900> the<00:03:59.440> volumes<00:03:59.889> are<00:04:00.040> low<00:04:00.220> so<00:04:00.790> the

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
are wide the volumes are low so the

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.100 
are wide the volumes are low so the
boards<00:04:01.209> are<00:04:01.299> not<00:04:01.329> really<00:04:01.750> thick

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 
boards are not really thick

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.960 
boards are not really thick
so<00:04:02.350> you're<00:04:02.470> not<00:04:02.620> standing<00:04:02.890> so<00:04:03.250> high<00:04:03.430> above<00:04:03.790> the

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
so you're not standing so high above the

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.810 
so you're not standing so high above the
water<00:04:04.150> which<00:04:04.780> gives<00:04:05.050> you<00:04:05.170> more<00:04:05.350> balance<00:04:05.820> you

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:06.820 
water which gives you more balance you

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:07.680 
water which gives you more balance you

I<00:04:15.070> have<00:04:15.430> to<00:04:15.610> admit<00:04:15.790> that<00:04:15.910> I<00:04:16.030> was<00:04:16.060> quite

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:16.480 
I have to admit that I was quite

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.360 
I have to admit that I was quite
skeptical<00:04:17.110> because<00:04:17.200> if<00:04:17.560> you<00:04:17.650> go<00:04:17.799> too<00:04:17.860> thin<00:04:18.340> on

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
skeptical because if you go too thin on

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.400 
skeptical because if you go too thin on
the<00:04:18.640> rails<00:04:18.850> sometimes<00:04:19.420> you<00:04:19.630> end<00:04:19.780> up<00:04:19.989> that<00:04:20.230> the

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
the rails sometimes you end up that the

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.950 
the rails sometimes you end up that the
red<00:04:20.560> start<00:04:20.950> catching<00:04:21.489> and<00:04:21.700> that's<00:04:22.540> why<00:04:22.750> they

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
red start catching and that's why they

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.470 
red start catching and that's why they
we<00:04:23.470> kept<00:04:23.770> pretty<00:04:24.100> much<00:04:24.310> that<00:04:24.550> rail<00:04:24.850> profile

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:25.480 
we kept pretty much that rail profile

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.620 
we kept pretty much that rail profile
all<00:04:26.380> the<00:04:26.770> way<00:04:26.890> forward<00:04:27.310> to<00:04:28.030> make<00:04:28.240> sure<00:04:28.270> that

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
all the way forward to make sure that

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.110 
all the way forward to make sure that
doesn't<00:04:28.840> happen<00:04:29.020> and<00:04:29.860> thin<00:04:30.280> it<00:04:30.460> out<00:04:30.610> the<00:04:30.880> tale

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
doesn't happen and thin it out the tale

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.390 
doesn't happen and thin it out the tale
that<00:04:31.450> in<00:04:32.050> the<00:04:32.170> combination<00:04:32.830> with<00:04:33.010> the<00:04:33.130> tailor

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
that in the combination with the tailor

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.940 
that in the combination with the tailor
it's<00:04:34.210> just<00:04:34.420> amazing<00:04:34.930> how<00:04:34.960> they<00:04:35.710> actually

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:35.950 
it's just amazing how they actually

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:39.360 
it's just amazing how they actually
turned<00:04:36.460> and<00:04:37.440> you<00:04:38.440> will<00:04:38.590> see<00:04:38.800> that<00:04:38.920> in<00:04:39.100> a<00:04:39.130> bit

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
turned and you will see that in a bit

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.780 
turned and you will see that in a bit
what<00:04:39.880> I<00:04:39.940> think<00:04:40.300> is<00:04:40.480> another<00:04:41.350> quite<00:04:41.790> quite

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:42.790 
what I think is another quite quite

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:44.520 
what I think is another quite quite
amazing<00:04:43.270> feature<00:04:43.570> on<00:04:43.780> the<00:04:43.870> ball<00:04:44.050> being<00:04:44.290> that

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
amazing feature on the ball being that

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.520 
amazing feature on the ball being that
short<00:04:44.860> that<00:04:45.130> wide<00:04:45.690> what<00:04:46.690> it<00:04:46.780> allows<00:04:47.080> the<00:04:47.350> board

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
short that wide what it allows the board

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.040 
short that wide what it allows the board
to<00:04:47.620> do<00:04:47.860> is<00:04:47.980> its<00:04:48.130> planing<00:04:48.730> speed<00:04:49.060> is<00:04:49.480> a<00:04:49.540> couple

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
to do is its planing speed is a couple

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.260 
to do is its planing speed is a couple
of<00:04:50.110> knots<00:04:50.380> slower<00:04:50.860> than<00:04:51.370> say<00:04:51.640> the<00:04:51.820> fork<00:04:52.060> or

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
of knots slower than say the fork or

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.840 
of knots slower than say the fork or
even<00:04:52.600> the<00:04:52.720> shark<00:04:52.990> that<00:04:53.740> will<00:04:54.340> that<00:04:54.490> allows<00:04:54.730> to
