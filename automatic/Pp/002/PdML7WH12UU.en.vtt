how<00:00:48.470> does<00:00:48.530> this<00:00:48.650> device<00:00:49.400> work<00:00:49.720> so<00:00:50.720> the<00:00:50.839> device

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
how does this device work so the device

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.560 
how does this device work so the device
itself<00:00:51.470> is<00:00:51.949> what<00:00:52.190> Andy<00:00:52.730> calls<00:00:52.940> a<00:00:53.059> performance

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
itself is what Andy calls a performance

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.319 
itself is what Andy calls a performance
tablet<00:00:53.989> because<00:00:54.649> the<00:00:54.890> design<00:00:55.550> itself<00:00:55.760> is<00:00:56.239> a

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
tablet because the design itself is a

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:58.840 
tablet because the design itself is a
slight<00:00:56.660> it<00:00:57.440> has<00:00:57.680> quad<00:00:57.980> core<00:00:58.160> performance<00:00:58.340> it

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
slight it has quad core performance it

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.310 
slight it has quad core performance it
does<00:00:58.969> have<00:00:59.120> been<00:00:59.359> because<00:00:59.719> it<00:00:59.840> is<00:00:59.930> actively

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
does have been because it is actively

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.430 
does have been because it is actively
cool<00:01:01.030> but<00:01:02.030> this<00:01:02.120> can<00:01:02.300> fold<00:01:02.570> up<00:01:02.690> and<00:01:03.140> draw<00:01:03.379> the
