00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.620 
by and blend it the other way and then
hopefully<00:01:42.579> it<00:01:42.939> works<00:01:43.380> haha<00:01:45.149> if<00:01:46.149> anybody<00:01:46.420> can

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
hopefully it works haha if anybody can

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.080 
hopefully it works haha if anybody can
get<00:01:46.930> it<00:01:47.020> to<00:01:47.140> work<00:01:47.259> I<00:01:47.469> know<00:01:47.530> you<00:01:47.740> can<00:01:48.130> yeah<00:01:48.460> yeah

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
get it to work I know you can yeah yeah

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.209 
get it to work I know you can yeah yeah
normally<00:01:49.659> the<00:01:49.840> mines<00:01:50.500> are<00:01:50.680> gonna<00:01:50.859> be<00:01:51.009> quite

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:51.219 
normally the mines are gonna be quite

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:54.240 
normally the mines are gonna be quite
long<00:01:51.659> but<00:01:52.659> I<00:01:52.719> think<00:01:53.109> if<00:01:53.259> you<00:01:53.409> just<00:01:53.439> bike<00:01:53.950> air

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
long but I think if you just bike air

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.980 
long but I think if you just bike air
flow<00:01:54.460> lines<00:01:54.729> or<00:01:55.030> something<00:01:55.390> like<00:01:55.479> that<00:01:55.539> yeah

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
flow lines or something like that yeah

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.469 
flow lines or something like that yeah
it's<00:01:56.140> no<00:01:56.289> stretch<00:01:57.119> shouldn't<00:01:58.119> really<00:01:58.270> matter

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
it's no stretch shouldn't really matter

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:01.649 
it's no stretch shouldn't really matter
that<00:01:58.659> they're<00:01:58.929> so<00:01:59.140> long<00:02:00.149> that<00:02:01.149> doesn't<00:02:01.509> work

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
that they're so long that doesn't work

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.639 
that they're so long that doesn't work
I'll<00:02:01.929> make<00:02:02.079> another<00:02:02.289> plan<00:02:03.869> gonna<00:02:04.869> work<00:02:05.079> and

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
I'll make another plan gonna work and

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:08.160 
I'll make another plan gonna work and
will<00:02:05.859> be<00:02:06.009> UK's<00:02:06.340> off<00:02:06.609> off<00:02:06.850> just<00:02:06.880> sailing<00:02:07.810> and
