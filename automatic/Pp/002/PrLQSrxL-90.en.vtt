hi guys today I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:02.429> change<00:00:03.090> the<00:00:03.500> layers<00:00:04.500> and<00:00:04.980> the<00:00:05.640> height<00:00:05.910> of

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
to change the layers and the height of

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.080 
to change the layers and the height of
each<00:00:06.210> layer<00:00:06.480> of<00:00:06.509> your<00:00:07.020> single-player

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:08.090 
each layer of your single-player

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.690 
each layer of your single-player
superflat<00:00:09.090> worlds<00:00:10.130> you<00:00:11.130> can<00:00:11.280> do<00:00:11.400> this<00:00:11.550> by

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
superflat worlds you can do this by

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.610 
superflat worlds you can do this by
going<00:00:11.730> to<00:00:12.059> single-player<00:00:12.960> creating<00:00:13.440> a<00:00:13.500> new

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
going to single-player creating a new

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.170 
going to single-player creating a new
world<00:00:13.889> and<00:00:16.369> customizing<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.640> super<00:00:17.940> flat

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
world and customizing the super flat

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.220 
world and customizing the super flat
world<00:00:18.359> type<00:00:19.609> we'll<00:00:20.609> go<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:20.760> presets<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:21.510> then

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
world type we'll go to presets and then

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.769 
world type we'll go to presets and then
what<00:00:22.710> we<00:00:22.830> have<00:00:23.039> here<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:24.119> first<00:00:24.330> number<00:00:24.660> is

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
what we have here the first number is

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.810 
what we have here the first number is
going<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:24.990> be<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.199> version<00:00:25.380> number<00:00:25.859> followed

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
going to be the version number followed

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.889 
going to be the version number followed
by<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:28.340> layers<00:00:29.340> in<00:00:30.380> the<00:00:31.380> super<00:00:32.160> flat<00:00:32.369> map

00:00:32.889 --> 00:00:32.899 
by the layers in the super flat map

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:36.700 
by the layers in the super flat map
followed<00:00:33.899> by<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.559> bot<00:00:34.739> or<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.190> biome<00:00:35.850> number

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
followed by the bot or the biome number

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.430 
followed by the bot or the biome number
followed<00:00:37.710> by<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:38.280> village<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:40.170> can<00:00:40.290> add<00:00:40.410> on

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
followed by a village and you can add on

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.869 
followed by a village and you can add on
whatever<00:00:40.829> you<00:00:40.950> want<00:00:41.190> I'll<00:00:41.309> put<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.489> link<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.790> the

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
wiki page with all the different codes

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.979 
wiki page with all the different codes
and<00:00:44.129> stuff<00:00:44.280> you<00:00:44.430> can<00:00:44.550> put<00:00:44.700> in<00:00:44.789> here<00:00:45.000> but

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
and stuff you can put in here but

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.299 
and stuff you can put in here but
basically<00:00:46.320> for<00:00:46.590> now<00:00:46.680> I<00:00:46.710> just<00:00:46.829> want<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.129> focus

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
basically for now I just want to focus

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.979 
basically for now I just want to focus
on<00:00:48.230> showing<00:00:49.230> you<00:00:49.350> how<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:50.600> change<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.809> layer

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
on showing you how to change the layer

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.060 
on showing you how to change the layer
so<00:00:52.289> we<00:00:52.410> can<00:00:52.530> keep<00:00:53.930> item<00:00:54.930> id<00:00:55.050> seven<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.680> bedrock

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
so we can keep item id seven is bedrock

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.700 
so we can keep item id seven is bedrock
so<00:00:56.340> we<00:00:56.430> can<00:00:56.550> keep<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:56.879> layer<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.559> then<00:00:58.559> we'll

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
so we can keep that layer and then we'll

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.700 
so we can keep that layer and then we'll
put<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.859> comma<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.520> we'll<00:01:00.480> have<00:01:00.690> two<00:01:01.500> layers<00:01:01.800> of

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
put a comma and we'll have two layers of

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.250 
put a comma and we'll have two layers of
grass<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:05.600> then<00:01:06.600> we<00:01:06.810> can<00:01:06.990> have<00:01:07.200> poops<00:01:08.040> comma

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
grass and then we can have poops comma

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:18.410 
grass and then we can have poops comma
ten<00:01:10.260> layers<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:12.680> TNT<00:01:15.860> so<00:01:16.860> if<00:01:17.549> we<00:01:17.880> go<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.119> use

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
ten layers of TNT so if we go to use

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.710 
ten layers of TNT so if we go to use
preset<00:01:18.900> now<00:01:19.080> we'll<00:01:19.259> see<00:01:19.580> we<00:01:20.580> have<00:01:20.820> on<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.509> top

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
preset now we'll see we have on the top

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.530 
preset now we'll see we have on the top
layer<00:01:21.930> that's<00:01:22.229> ten<00:01:22.439> layers<00:01:22.680> of<00:01:22.890> TNT<00:01:23.540> two

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
layer that's ten layers of TNT two

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.810 
layer that's ten layers of TNT two
layers<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:25.200> grass<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.799> one<00:01:26.310> layer<00:01:26.490> of<00:01:26.670> bedrock

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
layers of grass and one layer of bedrock

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.670 
layers of grass and one layer of bedrock
and<00:01:27.299> as<00:01:27.570> long<00:01:27.750> as<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:27.930> keep<00:01:28.080> adding<00:01:28.200> commas

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
and as long as you keep adding commas

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.770 
and as long as you keep adding commas
you<00:01:28.710> can<00:01:28.979> keep<00:01:29.189> adding<00:01:29.369> more<00:01:29.670> layers<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.390> have

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
you can keep adding more layers and have

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.330 
you can keep adding more layers and have
each<00:01:30.930> layer<00:01:31.140> be<00:01:31.380> is<00:01:31.500> because<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:32.009> want<00:01:32.189> it<00:01:32.250> to

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
each layer be is because you want it to

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.719 
each layer be is because you want it to
be<00:01:33.020> given<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.290> minecraft<00:01:34.530> has<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.369> height

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
be given that minecraft has a height

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.410 
be given that minecraft has a height
ceiling<00:01:36.560> so<00:01:37.820> once<00:01:38.820> you're<00:01:38.939> done<00:01:38.970> with<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.240> go

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
ceiling so once you're done with that go

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.080 
ceiling so once you're done with that go
to<00:01:39.479> done<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:39.960> create<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.650> new<00:01:40.770> world<00:01:41.009> and

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.630

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
there you go you have your world to dig

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.170 
there you go you have your world to dig
down<00:01:47.850> you'll<00:01:48.270> see<00:01:48.540> that<00:01:49.399> we<00:01:50.399> have<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.759> the
