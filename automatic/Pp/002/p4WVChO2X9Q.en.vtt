00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:11.960
 The other day mouse computer's 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:18.140
 It turned out when I was interviewed at Akihabara Direct Shop 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:23.030
 windows 8.1 with Modelo of bing is already so I'm released 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:25.590
 Do you take a look at the model a little in the web page by say 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:29.020
 Yeah Hey here 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:33.090
 If you try to pin Gutte search 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:38.150
 Then you can do with such a list 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.150
 Network comes out queuing using the model 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:45.300
 Around the desktop 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.870
 I just desktop or say but this is a net top I mean Well Tsu desktop 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.610
 Ne 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:56.280
 Come out here but you omit the fine explanation 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:01:00.760
 All I know instant delivery model Watch of the major fixed me intellectual hand 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:04.900
 In other words this page is the shortest day shipping ok also in immediate delivery 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:10.630
 It becomes only the hair species are listed here you are 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:11.320
 As these models can not be customized, you can not change the type of os . 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.680
 Right 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:20.610
 It is bing fixed because it is such a thing 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:27.110
 I think I do not know the Tteyuu how much prices from falling and to wing 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:34.240
 Well then , let's have a look at this Rob machine's mma r 331 e 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:37.170
 If you look at the original product page of this and say what 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.170
 It is this way 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:44.509
 peach 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:49.929
 lma r 311 and later 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:49.929
 Customize here and press the button 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.670
 I can only choose these two 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:01.070
 I can not choose with bing 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:02.270
 It is very difficult to understand how cheap it would be in a ring 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:09.319
 right 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:12.610
 However I feel that I wonder if cursory and will be calculated for a 1000 yen to N tarp 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.610
 In this model Tsu 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:20.530
 It is such a specification 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:24.330
 Indian soa store chirp date 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.810
 Toei cpu a 4 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:32.080
 There is also 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:38.410
 Memory 4 giga hard disk 500 e is super multi drive in ー ー ー ー ー 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:42.070
 By this I saw 39,800 yen and I saw it earlier 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:46.770
 This is also the same configuration 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:53.730
 Other than os, so maybe this 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:58.770
 As long as you look at the screen, it will be judged that only 2000 yen will be cheaper. 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:03.180
 The first place is not different from me windows light path qualified by the manufacturer 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:04.770
 By the manufacturer of I mean can Biti in how much by the genital 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.790
 It's different. 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:11.349
 So with this 2000 yen 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:18.310
 It can not generally be said whether au is appropriate or not 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:22.630
 Epson's sound ny 40 s 7,000 yen so easy, so compared to that 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:27.930
 Well, after a very small impact of 2000 yen 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:28.910
 Epson's n 40 series is supposed to be this 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.470
 Hmmm 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:36.470
 Old line mark 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:41.060
 The desert is 7,000 yen and anyway the on- site mouse computer is 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:46.580
 Since the wing model of the use is a very limited 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:48.950
 From the bing model of the notebook pc in general there is still nothing at all 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:55.020
 There is a feeling that is not put 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:56.190
 Other makers have not put a son except Epson Direct 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:01.280
 Than 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.280
 Still Hey What a future we are in relation to 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.520
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.860
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.230
 wh 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.230
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:21.410
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.410
 Had
