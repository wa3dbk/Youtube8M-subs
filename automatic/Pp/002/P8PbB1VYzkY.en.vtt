00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.470
 [Music] 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.680
 just as we promised we gave ourselves to the 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.200
 task to pursue at all costs white 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.210
 García then after finding out that 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.620
 dismissed from the channel screen 10 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.750
 We had to know, yes or yes, why 

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.880
 well I think all the changes and all 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.440
 the cycles in life have a date 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.840
 of expiration and I think it 's my cycle in 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:31.290
 channel 10 pitifully unexpected but 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.120
 good came this strange beauty no 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.670
 is the one that keeps nothing 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.260
 ensures that sincerity more than a 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.940
 defect is a virtue 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.469
 and people that more than I do not keep anything do not 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.850
 I like to lie to viewers the 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:44.710
 truth is that it was seven years that 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.879
 I believe that one of my greatest successes 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.320
 because I always spoke with the truth 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.089
 It's always the things I thought of them 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.159
 he liked people or I 'm not too 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:52.570
 sincere and why going to lie today 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:54.190
 the people who have followed me so much and who 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.780
 I still follow my social networks and 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.879
 where I go, people believe me a lot but 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.390
 I'm not going to lie to you because the truth is 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:02.799
 They gave me a letter, I did not 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.899
 I understood nothing in the end I did not understand anything 

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:06.520
 but if you know that sometimes in this 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:08.979
 means there are many intrigues many gossip 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.860
 very envious and unfortunately I went 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:13.650
 victim 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.960
 with the exit of white garcía the networks 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.240
 and speculations of the viewers not 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.910
 they waited and immediately 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.640
 they pronounced suggesting that between white 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.830
 Garcia Yaoska Alvarez and Aminta Ramirez 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.350
 there is a rivalry because it is not 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.360
 they fired publicly with their ex 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.080
 as a presenter as they did 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.460
 on the channel facebook if we did it 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.620
 what happens that we did not want to do it so 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.120
 public but if we say goodbye to them 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.410
 he could not ride us with 31 and always 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.930
 because it was our online day we 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:46.080
 work on December 24 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.690
 as is common the hypothesis of his retirement 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.240
 They vibrated as he supports what but the same 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:56.070
 TV presenter tells us 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:58.410
 everything has something to do the going of 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.920
 friendship ramirez with you with your dismissal from 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.990
 well channel 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.329
 [Music] 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.530
 if there was a problem if there were 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:06.820
 we get along all the time 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.080
 when we arrived minty them 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.509
 we received with open arms we 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.459
 he seems a very good person you know 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.980
 that she is very religious and all this 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.209
 of Christianity that already has then 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.069
 we welcome you with a lot of love 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.540
 even now Oscar opened the doors of 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.660
 your beauty salon where I took her 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.340
 Dona Valeria was happy or almost 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.900
 that a makeover because we take it up 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.430
 marta silva shop for her 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.010
 dresses every day well and of 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.360
 Suddenly he had a change that is natural 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.099
 when you do not have many years in the 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.569
 television sometimes you do not know what you have 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:36.660
 have your feet well placed on the 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.660
 land 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.739
 but as every ending has a new 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.610
 white start assures us that your 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.590
 career does not end here 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.940
 Of course I do not have many 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.010
 projects many goals in fact makes 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.890
 many months I've been thinking about a 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.420
 own business because the years go by 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.460
 happening and you know that television 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.230
 that we who have a passion the 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.730
 that we carry in this is a passion but 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.620
 you also have to look for a business I think 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.220
 because soon I might be at a 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.820
 family will also give you the scoop 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:12.569
 so I have to go thinking about that 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:12.569
