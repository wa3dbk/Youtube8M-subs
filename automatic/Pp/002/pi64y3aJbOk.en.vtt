00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:06.649
 it's a license that has more or less 

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:09.410
 about eight nine ten years of real life 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:11.900
 although it has become very popular 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:15.050
 to the movie that premiered a year ago 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.150
 and good to half 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:19.940
 us the producers of the movie 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.800
 and they are and we met one day we said that 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.840
 we must take advantage of the impact that 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.810
 had this great movie try to take out 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.580
 another Spanish product also for 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.260
 some platform in this case are and 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.090
 bet strong said and I like this 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.100
 I also want her as an exclusive game 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.329
 to see is to avoid there was us silver 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.150
 more meetings and in the end it's over 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:40.220
 being this that will leave this Christmas 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:42.350
 the game is not based on the universe 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.239
 it is the movie it is evident that yes it is 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.100
 important within the story but 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.050
 besides the movie there are both 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.310
 short films that won a buoy in their 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.680
 moment 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:54.230
 let's say they help expand a little more what 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.330
 which is the Tadeo universe and the fans of 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.460
 the license is leo he explains something else 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.540
 of them since many kids 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.050
 they know the movie but not the 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.610
 short films by walt the game is line 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.830
 plot movie and occasionally 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.020
 flash backs in which the past is explained 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.360
 of tadeo for example when he meets his 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.190
 dog when he discovers that he wants 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.990
 to put the archaeological theme and other 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.370
 above all it is a game see is important 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.800
 say that it is designed for kids of 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.600
 6 to 12 years according to which it has been 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.830
 tried to make a game that is very 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.240
 direct because the kids want 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.880
 start playing very fast you know how 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.320
 is the world of the children's how 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.180
 you play fast with the tablet and other 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.830
 you have already made a game designed for 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.290
 them with scroll platforms 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.810
 horizontal with specific moments of 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.160
 phases in which, above all, the 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.320
 potential of the console which is avoided 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.510
 with its peculiarities the screen 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.790
 is here in the back the gyroscope and 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.860
 others to add elements let's say 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.960
 surprise as for example the possibility 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.600
 to be able to control the zone and the parrot 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.520
 or the dog jeff because those levels have 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.830
 a different gameplay but general the 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.170
 game is a horizontal platforms to 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.440
 visually attractive because it 's very 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.630
 similar to the movie 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.700
 the goal at the end is that of the 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.130
 movie come to the end and get that 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.420
 task edit all the risks because it was 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.400
 of or not is an aggressive character is a 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.080
 defensive character that normally 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.830
 Escape from everything you can is a little 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.830
 the objective of the game
