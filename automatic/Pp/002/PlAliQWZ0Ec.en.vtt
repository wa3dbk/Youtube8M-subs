00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 Hello and welcome 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.670
 dear youtube friends my name is 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:12.630
 serious and today it's about the topic 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:14.639
 good sirius and evil series yes 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.560
 Basically, this is the first time 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.449
 a great contrast of the good sirius and 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.420
 the evil sirius we the last 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.740
 follow her questions and say reputedly 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.420
 so who have not yet seen that 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.380
 I have seen should you'll 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.599
 below in the video description 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.279
 link once I answer in the 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.050
 week the question of the audience and me 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.790
 I had the freedom and that 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.489
 fire but also announced that I 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.559
 ask to answer evil so 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.770
 relatively cynical and sarcastic on it 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.750
 Answer and a little bit so well 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.520
 behind the real thoughts of one 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.039
 Let youtube look by simply 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.780
 Sometimes evil answers are frequent 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.800
 questions that are really asked 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:57.000
 my god so dumb stupid 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.260
 boring and uninteresting and that 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.120
 Sometimes you really see the audience 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.329
 wants to pack and wants to shake 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.939
 Of course that is absolutely forbidden 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.060
 as youtube because as youtube you have to 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.860
 always be wonderfully friendly smile 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.840
 his shine for your audience because 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.540
 always have an open ear of course 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.420
 from morning at 1 to 6 at night 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.280
 answer any questions immediately 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.259
 so you do not be so three 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.750
 question mark three question mark three 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.340
 question mark gets set because it is 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.990
 so totally incomprehensible that I am at night 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.150
 Sleep and no questions answered 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.049
 and then there was this consequence with the 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.290
 answer bad 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.329
 and indeed that have to mine 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.520
 Surprise relatively many people 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.890
 So yes , relatively many of you are heading 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.689
 actually have the evil sirius the 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.390
 angry comments and sarcastic 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.340
 comments customers totally celebrated where 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.630
 is there going on with you yes that has to be 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.390
 always be that way you always only 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.649
 outrageous and assi is and well ok the 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.240
 your mother jokes the goods were really 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.159
 a bit flat that has to be done now 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.860
 but that's just how they are 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.479
 ask us as we say follow completely 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.100
 are unprepared just like that now 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.600
 here so there is no script that 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.890
 only thing I hold do in the run 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.509
 is my topic superior and that was 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.550
 Then today, what do you do and then you came 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.060
 I just eight speakers and a nonsense 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.370
 over it 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.650
 and maybe that does not always apply 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.620
 100 on the point yes and maybe is 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.180
 you in it and so but it's just for 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.349
 I somehow felt authentic myself 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.880
 I do not feel like sitting down now 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.680
 to write texts 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.120
 not because I can not write or 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.130
 do not want to write or too lazy 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.660
 I'm just because of that 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.000
 Unauthentic if I think so 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.810
 everything before so to the smallest detail 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.260
 over lying 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.900
 In contrast to the really evil serious 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.950
 who gave only naughty answers gave 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.599
 it then on the dear video directly 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.220
 again in connection because the evil 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.480
 sierhahn directly 50 people within 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.790
 half an hour that dismantled that 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.049
 you're actually funny to see 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.720
 I love that I have so much 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:50.160
 very very happy and very very polite 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.660
 actually answered a bit 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.580
 polite than as you come to expect from me 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.590
 although I try to be regular in 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.569
 to be nice 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.980
 in the end it was somehow one 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.540
 nice variety also times the people 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.190
 because the opinion of Sophos face too 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.630
 beat where I have said in the run 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.910
 people that's not acting 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.680
 And that's 100 percent the truth 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.569
 and even that sentence was natural 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.260
 acted and even this sentence 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:15.870
 was of course ironic because you tried 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.880
 yes, always a certain way 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.230
 to be true to yours 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.780
 exchanges and that makes me too 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.180
 in real life yes who of you in the 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.579
 real life says i keep running 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.769
 his boss you annoy his girlfriend you 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:30.870
 nerves his mother you learn what knows 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.549
 I yes but one is always one 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.410
 far from polite and I think that is 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:37.380
 actually a very important train 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.819
 in the internet you also keep it here 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.799
 should and i just notice if 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:43.620
 I'm kinder to you, you are too 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:45.120
 So not so much now 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.519
 but unfortunately most of the time you are 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.260
 also nice to me and i had too 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.000
 really a few nasty comments below 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.069
 the serious where the people said 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.560
 have you saved yourself what is that supposed to do 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:58.319
 Abortion and so and then I allow 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:03.750
 me the freedom of the canal owner the 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:06.299
 god almighty power to say yes 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.560
 Do you know what banned and I do that 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:09.359
 of course then so if the people 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.280
 tell me too much to go then stop hey 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:13.620
 This is my channel and then I think 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.359
 is that the increase of evil first 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.039
 what to say bad then you go one 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:17.989
 sales and then go sometimes very angry 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:20.430
 spell 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.820
 I liked that very well, I have that too 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.590
 so a bit as 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.880
 natural selection or selection 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.590
 just look at that with us then one 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.330
 some players have gotten rid of the 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.560
 did not understand this irony 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.850
 I then found a bit sad 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.760
 or something completely different in the last days 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:37.690
 little bit questionable why is 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:39.550
 so that you are so upright out there 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.620
 yes that's also that was on 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.630
 a lot of other big channels are built up 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.730
 are of course on julians blog but 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.890
 all this there is a lot of cod 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:49.510
 commentators totally freaked out and 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.550
 the people insult in their videos 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:54.610
 and it's totally celebrated by kids so 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.350
 there she will be and shit 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.360
 just celebrated and there I am 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.560
 thought really cool that the 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.220
 People here also celebrated my video 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.410
 to have 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.940
 but somehow it's super shit that he does 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.890
 actually celebrated that for me 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.700
 the shit to others was that gave me 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:09.280
 to think such a little bit 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:12.820
 So I think as a certain measure of 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.590
 sarcasm and so a degree of yes 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:18.250
 hardly older now we do not go in the bag 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:19.840
 So now the question is a measure 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:22.360
 of sarcasm and some measure of 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.980
 Honesty I think everything is wonderful 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.900
 As a youtuber you should also be on your own 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.670
 do not even protect yourself from 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:31.300
 these types of people say everything anyway 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:33.750
 Everything was great, but everything was licon 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.320
 guide the rest now 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.790
 So I think so a bit 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.170
 Honesty and a little bit , sometimes 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:40.300
 say his opinion is just one of them 

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:42.610
 yes and who's the thing kids out there and 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.230
 I guess that is in the least 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.700
 case adult spectators but we 

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:46.900
 that the younger audience is not 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.920
 want to understand because they say 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:52.510
 how does he talk to me? I am his 

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.830
 abonnent yes my face then you have it 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:55.600
 just not understood in the reason stand 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.280
 I'm here and travel with the daily 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.450
 ass also for the people out there yes 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.440
 So that would be for now 

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:01.870
 for example an honest and open again 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.340
 opinion so i take it now 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:05.200
 videos just shown because 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.390
 i thought oh my god i'm going now 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.800
 right away drink something 

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:10.480
 little celebration and so tomorrow 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.950
 holiday with me in north rhine-westphalia 

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:13.360
 i do not know if anywhere i believe 

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:15.100
 is not everywhere in North Rhine Westphalia 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.510
 tomorrow holiday that means I 'm going 

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.280
 get out a bit today and still 

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:20.590
 I took the time to me 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.580
 to put down and say evil sirius 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:23.380
 everything is wonderful 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.810
 have you super geliked great comments 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.950
 written vehlefanz super funny and 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:28.660
 honestly I found so great 

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:31.030
 funny a parser one answers, too 

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:33.850
 class but basically I think 

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:35.320
 should my channel and none at all 

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:37.390
 channel on it 

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:39.550
 builds only the people in ass 

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:41.470
 but I can find it 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:43.060
 basically quite cool if we all like that 

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:45.160
 a little bit nice so sander 

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:47.740
 are and sometimes a sarcastic 

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:49.360
 and an ironic answer to life 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:52.930
 a bit funnier and a little bit 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:54.390
 honest makes that again for places 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:56.800
 once managed a blog for 

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:58.630
 in between and leads udo I will 

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:00.910
 you either right or left this 

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:02.290
 video with the evil sirius from left 

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:03.400
 and if you like it but only 

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:04.510
 really if he likes it and
