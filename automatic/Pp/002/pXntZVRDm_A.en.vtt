size of Chicago you put it in Canada
it's<00:02:59.560> wrong<00:02:59.800> but<00:03:00.459> you<00:03:00.580> put<00:03:00.790> the<00:03:00.970> worst

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
it's wrong but you put the worst

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.320 
it's wrong but you put the worst
possible<00:03:02.290> setup<00:03:03.160> freeways<00:03:03.790> going<00:03:04.120> through

Mississauga

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.580 
Mississauga
that's<00:03:12.300> a<00:03:12.390> lie<00:03:12.540> there's<00:03:12.780> a<00:03:12.840> toll<00:03:13.050> road<00:03:13.080> but

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
that's a lie there's a toll road but

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.680

nobody goes in the toll road costs money

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:21.320 
nobody goes in the toll road costs money
so<00:03:15.870> they<00:03:16.590> all<00:03:16.740> stay<00:03:17.010> on<00:03:17.810> 401<00:03:19.460> the<00:03:20.460> 401<00:03:21.060> up<00:03:21.210> in
