14 to 42 millimeter lens is that each

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.820 
14 to 42 millimeter lens is that each
time<00:00:24.689> you<00:00:24.810> take<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.080> lens<00:00:25.260> on<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:25.740> off

so each time I adjust the lens each time
I<00:00:34.200> swap<00:00:34.500> out<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.710> lens<00:00:35.010> even<00:00:35.700> if<00:00:35.910> I<00:00:35.969> leave<00:00:36.120> dust

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360
