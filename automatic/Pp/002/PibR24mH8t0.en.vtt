00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
the very first time so yeah so that will

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.589 
the very first time so yeah so that will
see<00:03:37.750> they<00:03:37.989> are<00:03:38.019> i<00:03:38.709> play<00:03:39.700> with<00:03:39.940> that<00:03:40.120> one<00:03:40.359> so

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:40.599 
see they are i play with that one so

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:42.390 
see they are i play with that one so
that's<00:03:40.750> why<00:03:41.049> this<00:03:41.109> one's<00:03:41.530> a<00:03:41.650> little<00:03:41.769> more

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
that's why this one's a little more

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.059 
that's why this one's a little more
bouncy<00:03:42.970> but<00:03:43.209> they<00:03:43.810> are<00:03:44.049> the<00:03:44.410> same<00:03:44.769> wave

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:45.069 
bouncy but they are the same wave

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:50.940 
bouncy but they are the same wave
pattern<00:03:46.919> on<00:03:47.919> this<00:03:48.280> is<00:03:48.489> the<00:03:48.609> 18<00:03:49.650> same<00:03:50.650> thing

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
pattern on this is the 18 same thing

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:59.099 
pattern on this is the 18 same thing
here<00:03:53.549> your<00:03:54.549> bundle<00:03:56.549> same<00:03:57.549> same<00:03:58.540> bearden<00:03:58.989> on

00:03:59.099 --> 00:03:59.109 
here your bundle same same bearden on

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:01.920 
here your bundle same same bearden on
the<00:03:59.260> track<00:03:59.560> so<00:04:00.040> it's<00:04:00.549> a<00:04:00.609> little<00:04:00.790> small<00:04:01.239> amount

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
the track so it's a little small amount

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.619 
the track so it's a little small amount
of<00:04:02.019> bit<00:04:02.319> of<00:04:02.639> bearding<00:04:03.639> it's<00:04:04.030> not<00:04:04.299> enough<00:04:04.599> to

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:04.629 
of bit of bearding it's not enough to

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:06.030 
of bit of bearding it's not enough to
make<00:04:04.900> a<00:04:04.959> difference<00:04:05.079> when<00:04:05.590> you<00:04:05.680> do<00:04:05.829> your

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
make a difference when you do your

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.670 
make a difference when you do your
fold-over<00:04:06.370> method<00:04:06.549> so<00:04:07.090> search<00:04:07.629> for<00:04:07.870> 16<00:04:08.410> and

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
fold-over method so search for 16 and

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.890 
fold-over method so search for 16 and
you're<00:04:08.799> 18

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.529 

still<00:04:15.900> no<00:04:16.109> shitty<00:04:16.440> and<00:04:16.949> I'm<00:04:17.459> up<00:04:17.609> I<00:04:17.940> got<00:04:18.030> a<00:04:18.239> light

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:18.539 
still no shitty and I'm up I got a light

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:23.830 
still no shitty and I'm up I got a light
one<00:04:18.720> strand<00:04:19.139> guys<00:04:19.410> so<00:04:19.680> like<00:04:19.859> one<00:04:20.160> strand<00:04:20.699> here

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.969 

so<00:04:24.840> about<00:04:25.080> one<00:04:25.380> strand<00:04:25.889> of<00:04:26.490> on<00:04:26.639> that

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:27.979 
so about one strand of on that

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:31.129 
so about one strand of on that
but<00:04:28.979> that's<00:04:29.190> expect<00:04:29.729> that<00:04:29.940> this<00:04:30.180> here<00:04:30.780> is<00:04:31.110> the

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:31.139 
but that's expect that this here is the

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:35.629 
but that's expect that this here is the
20<00:04:31.919> and<00:04:32.160> this<00:04:33.060> is<00:04:33.210> the<00:04:33.360> 16<00:04:33.870> i<00:04:34.259> miss<00:04:34.889> expected

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:35.639 
20 and this is the 16 i miss expected

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:38.960 
20 and this is the 16 i miss expected
because<00:04:35.820> the<00:04:36.509> longer<00:04:36.780> the<00:04:37.050> lense<00:04:37.380> the<00:04:38.220> shorter

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
because the longer the lense the shorter

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.850 
because the longer the lense the shorter
the<00:04:39.000> short<00:04:39.900> of<00:04:39.990> the<00:04:40.050> tracks<00:04:40.320> are<00:04:40.470> going<00:04:40.650> to<00:04:40.710> be

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
the short of the tracks are going to be

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:46.999 
the short of the tracks are going to be
so<00:04:41.729> yeah<00:04:42.000> um<00:04:44.210> the<00:04:45.210> hair<00:04:45.419> it<00:04:45.750> has<00:04:46.110> a<00:04:46.139> a<00:04:46.560> weave

light color lace which means I'm going
to<00:05:02.639> have<00:05:02.699> to<00:05:02.849> die<00:05:03.150> the<00:05:03.210> lace<00:05:03.590> the<00:05:04.590> density<00:05:05.070> is

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:05.099 
to have to die the lace the density is

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:08.629 
to have to die the lace the density is
pretty<00:05:05.550> good<00:05:05.820> as<00:05:06.000> you<00:05:06.150> can<00:05:06.330> see<00:05:07.580> it's<00:05:08.580> a<00:05:08.610> pretty

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 
pretty good as you can see it's a pretty

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:16.550 
pretty good as you can see it's a pretty
good<00:05:09.090> density<00:05:09.300> on<00:05:09.840> here<00:05:12.080> and<00:05:14.270> it<00:05:15.270> is<00:05:15.300> a<00:05:16.169> by<00:05:16.500> the

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
good density on here and it is a by the

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:22.070 
good density on here and it is a by the
way<00:05:16.830> to<00:05:16.889> swell<00:05:17.870> compare<00:05:18.870> it<00:05:19.050> to<00:05:20.750> this<00:05:21.750> is<00:05:21.960> the

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
way to swell compare it to this is the

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:27.339 
way to swell compare it to this is the
20<00:05:22.409> inch<00:05:22.590> so<00:05:22.889> comparing<00:05:23.430> it<00:05:23.520> to<00:05:23.550> the<00:05:23.699> 20<00:05:24.180> inch

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:27.349 

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:32.570 

bundle<00:05:29.360> they<00:05:30.360> are<00:05:30.599> pretty<00:05:31.440> pretty<00:05:31.919> close<00:05:32.280> as

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
bundle they are pretty pretty close as

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.860 
bundle they are pretty pretty close as
far<00:05:32.849> as<00:05:33.000> the<00:05:33.210> wave<00:05:33.389> pattern<00:05:33.960> there<00:05:35.570> on<00:05:36.570> the

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
far as the wave pattern there on the

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.920 
far as the wave pattern there on the
closure<00:05:37.169> itself<00:05:37.800> it<00:05:38.039> does<00:05:38.250> have<00:05:38.580> the

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930 
closure itself it does have the

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.390 
closure itself it does have the
reinforced<00:05:39.930> edges<00:05:40.409> which<00:05:40.620> I<00:05:40.800> love<00:05:41.099> on<00:05:41.310> the

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 
reinforced edges which I love on the

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.510 
reinforced edges which I love on the
closure<00:05:41.699> because<00:05:42.000> I<00:05:42.419> thread<00:05:43.050> through<00:05:43.409> the

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 
closure because I thread through the

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.689 
closure because I thread through the
reinforcement<00:05:44.520> when<00:05:45.389> I'm<00:05:45.509> making<00:05:45.780> my<00:05:45.900> wig<00:05:46.699> the
