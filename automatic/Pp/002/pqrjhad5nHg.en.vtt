00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:07.140
 to have such a warm welcome and I want to show you Mortimer Tesco Light 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.489
 makes 

00:00:08.489 --> 00:00:10.179
 it's easy 

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:12.849
 and indeed "We need one for that 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:14.689
 came 

00:00:14.689 --> 00:00:16.599
 friend 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:18.939
 Spotlight 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:21.939
 provides underlined Spotlight 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:26.710
 I've done that to someone here 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.149
 there should then be the lamp 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:33.500
 I gave this light Emmeram Blue 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.500
 and have there 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.570
 taken a yellow color 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.420
 and at flex i did and girl beister tons and the check mark 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.420
 at rated Dynamic Light 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.510
 so I could still hang Wolfsburg 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.729
 and throws percent the broad 

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:57.729
 adjust the sounds 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.360
 that the zoo light would not be able to move now 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.120
 absolutely normal 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.890
 to make it go on and off we need a global theme in the 8th 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.950
 Name does not need to 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.350
 July celebrates under election 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.760
 a number and that 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.270
 Naumann 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.210
 that is, he does that light every second 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.410
 so for a second and it turns on and then right out again 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.900
 So go to the office 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.530
 Here we go for a short time 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.250
 and buckets 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.820
 he takes blue and then Leighton and then again the door on at 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.340
 r 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.340
 and homeland Leipzig Prof 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.520
 and a plague 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.730
 so it warms up more luxury 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.730
 just copied light 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.190
 a Mendes 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.580
 Roth 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.580
 only made good women 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.530
 Christians 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.470
 bes elms 

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:14.969
 Green Open 

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:19.189
 and m 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:22.189
 normal 

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:26.009
 and money 

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:27.669
 if it's money 

00:02:27.669 --> 00:02:28.849
 I have now 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:32.959
 Art Ortes again appear too long for every tenth new Le Big Timer 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.989
 puts what he needs 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.859
 I say for every new color 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:41.080
 not necessarily new logic home 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.809
 but he is with everyone 

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:46.489
 at other times, at times, about ten children all at the same time differently 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:50.599
 already stupid that's why I have a man only a second cook 5 here 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:51.459
 seconds 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.689
 nullkommanull 7 5 seconds and 1 Kor two seconds 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:57.139
 if I did not have many then 

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:00.659
 and those in a circle of word and order and rest 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:03.039
 but that is the only one the other day 

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:04.889
 I'm still doing that 

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:07.889
 Ariston a year took bullets 

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:11.589
 such a thing rowing a lot of poets off then turns 

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:15.089
 then found box 

00:03:15.749 --> 00:03:18.749
 times theme 12 times 12 

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:23.219
 senior can 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:28.389
 Mozilla's shoulders could have been wanted 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:30.799
 suppressed SCG and raises 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:33.799
 and we do Kirchheim 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:41.659
 thanks Little Red Riding Hood 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:45.829
 There must be something to worry about 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:50.579
 Lorch Sound Radius could find a way tracks 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:54.489
 and then you can order 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:58.459
 This is 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:01.559
 here both Maxut tables production 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:06.699
 Year could enter the fastest Secret hundred 

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:09.079
 Passable already you can do even faster 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:12.149
 That's just the way the lights do not go without it 

00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:15.149
 Roger Waters and protest 

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:18.939
 and do not just die there now 

00:04:25.249 --> 00:04:28.249
 so important in the light 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.009
 around 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:32.620
 we do not have to give her name 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.309
 i dont clean up Burgwald 

00:04:35.309 --> 00:04:37.210
 around 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.059
 Bayer do not be afraid 

00:04:40.059 --> 00:04:43.120
 I have a patent, and indeed 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.120
 You just have to turn the opponent around 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:50.030
 and then she gives here 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.030
 a few cents on this topic 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.520
 Moss is already one 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.360
 let's test that now 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.319
 that's how the tram looks like 

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:05.069
 the whole remains 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:09.130
 because the lights are now a little older than Uken 

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:11.839
 Bisses more fluid 

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:13.759
 Thread worms stop 

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:16.330
 but the crowd makes it natural when you still have it 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.330
 many different colors will hopefully make us really horny 

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:22.139
 I hope I could help you until the next too expensive
