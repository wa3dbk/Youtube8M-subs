what<00:00:49.469> i'm<00:00:49.559> using<00:00:49.800> my<00:00:49.950> kit<00:00:50.399> it's<00:00:51.030> got<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.239> do<00:00:51.329> one

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
what i'm using my kit it's got to do one

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.540 
what i'm using my kit it's got to do one
of<00:00:51.539> three<00:00:51.629> things<00:00:51.840> for<00:00:52.289> me<00:00:52.410> now<00:00:53.100> one<00:00:53.280> has<00:00:53.399> got

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
of three things for me now one has got

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.790 
of three things for me now one has got
to<00:00:53.640> be<00:00:53.699> smaller<00:00:54.059> number<00:00:54.840> two<00:00:55.050> it's<00:00:55.440> got<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.710> be

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
to be smaller number two it's got to be

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.979 
to be smaller number two it's got to be
lighter<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.219> number<00:00:57.030> three<00:00:57.300> it's<00:00:57.600> got<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.899> be

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
lighter and number three it's got to be

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.750 
lighter and number three it's got to be
more<00:00:58.170> efficient<00:00:58.649> than<00:00:59.219> what<00:00:59.460> i'm<00:00:59.550> currently

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
more efficient than what i'm currently

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.450 
more efficient than what i'm currently
using<00:01:00.739> so<00:01:01.739> this<00:01:01.920> is<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:02.129> Vargo<00:01:02.780> triad<00:01:04.460> titanium

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
using so this is a Vargo triad titanium

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.380 
using so this is a Vargo triad titanium
alcohol<00:01:05.820> stove<00:01:06.260> this<00:01:07.369> is<00:01:08.369> my<00:01:08.580> homemade<00:01:08.970> super

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
alcohol stove this is my homemade super

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.200 
alcohol stove this is my homemade super
cat<00:01:09.570> alcohol<00:01:10.049> stove<00:01:10.700> as<00:01:11.700> you<00:01:11.790> can<00:01:11.880> see<00:01:12.030> they're

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
cat alcohol stove as you can see they're

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.330 
cat alcohol stove as you can see they're
both<00:01:12.360> roughly<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.990> same<00:01:13.170> size<00:01:13.229> these<00:01:14.070> little

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
both roughly the same size these little

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.289 
both roughly the same size these little
tines<00:01:14.580> fold<00:01:15.119> down<00:01:16.310> so<00:01:17.310> actually<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.970> Vargo<00:01:18.270> is

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
tines fold down so actually the Vargo is

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.890 
tines fold down so actually the Vargo is
going<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.570> be<00:01:18.659> just<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.110> touch<00:01:19.320> smaller<00:01:20.869> take<00:01:21.869> a

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
going to be just a touch smaller take a

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:28.780 
going to be just a touch smaller take a
look<00:01:22.049> at<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.200> weights

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:37.570 

the<00:01:29.300> Vargo<00:01:29.660> comes<00:01:29.930> in<00:01:30.110> at<00:01:30.200> 27<00:01:30.920> grams<00:01:35.770> and<00:01:36.770> the

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
the Vargo comes in at 27 grams and the

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.910 
the Vargo comes in at 27 grams and the
super<00:01:37.940> cat<00:01:38.120> comes<00:01:38.420> in<00:01:38.540> at<00:01:38.660> seven<00:01:38.990> grams<00:01:39.230> so<00:01:39.860> you

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
super cat comes in at seven grams so you

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.530 
super cat comes in at seven grams so you
can<00:01:40.040> see<00:01:40.220> the<00:01:40.400> super<00:01:40.700> cats<00:01:40.910> a<00:01:41.060> clear<00:01:41.270> winner

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
can see the super cats a clear winner

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.140 
can see the super cats a clear winner
there<00:01:41.810> by<00:01:42.080> almost<00:01:42.380> an<00:01:42.620> ounce<00:01:42.830> in<00:01:43.220> terms<00:01:44.000> of

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
there by almost an ounce in terms of

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.960 
there by almost an ounce in terms of
weight<00:01:44.770> so<00:01:45.770> now<00:01:45.890> the<00:01:45.950> big<00:01:46.190> test<00:01:46.490> is<00:01:46.730> going<00:01:46.850> to

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
weight so now the big test is going to

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.180 
weight so now the big test is going to
be<00:01:47.120> the<00:01:47.570> efficiency<00:01:48.140> for<00:01:48.620> the<00:01:48.740> efficiency

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
be the efficiency for the efficiency

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.240 
be the efficiency for the efficiency
test<00:01:49.660> I'm<00:01:50.660> going<00:01:50.780> to<00:01:50.840> use<00:01:50.960> one<00:01:51.260> liter<00:01:51.920> of<00:01:52.010> water

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
test I'm going to use one liter of water

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.219 
test I'm going to use one liter of water
in<00:01:53.000> my<00:01:53.180> new<00:01:53.360> gsi<00:01:53.840> pinnacle<00:01:54.350> soloist<00:01:54.979> hot<00:01:56.229> I'm

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
in my new gsi pinnacle soloist hot I'm

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.170 
in my new gsi pinnacle soloist hot I'm
going<00:01:57.440> to<00:01:57.500> see<00:01:57.770> how<00:01:57.920> long<00:01:58.130> each<00:01:58.400> takes<00:01:58.700> to<00:01:58.910> cook

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
going to see how long each takes to cook

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.690 
going to see how long each takes to cook
or<00:01:59.450> to<00:01:59.810> boil<00:02:00.080> i'm<00:02:00.950> also<00:02:01.160> going<00:02:01.310> to<00:02:01.369> check<00:02:01.460> to

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
or to boil i'm also going to check to

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.810 
or to boil i'm also going to check to
see<00:02:01.729> how<00:02:02.030> much<00:02:02.150> fuel<00:02:02.479> they<00:02:02.630> use<00:02:03.250> now<00:02:04.250> one

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
see how much fuel they use now one

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.350 
see how much fuel they use now one
tablespoon<00:02:05.360> of<00:02:05.930> alcohol<00:02:06.710> is<00:02:07.360> roughly

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
tablespoon of alcohol is roughly

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.449 
tablespoon of alcohol is roughly
equivalent<00:02:08.390> to<00:02:08.810> half<00:02:09.110> an<00:02:09.259> ounce<00:02:09.410> half<00:02:10.310> the

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
equivalent to half an ounce half the

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:17.520 
equivalent to half an ounce half the
fluid<00:02:10.759> ounce<00:02:11.140> so<00:02:12.459> let's<00:02:13.459> get<00:02:13.670> the<00:02:13.790> test<00:02:13.970> set<00:02:14.180> up

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.260 

stove<00:02:48.110> holds<00:02:48.410> about<00:02:48.560> two<00:02:48.830> fluid<00:02:49.190> ounces<00:02:49.550> and<00:02:50.180> I

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
stove holds about two fluid ounces and I

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:51.400 
stove holds about two fluid ounces and I
know<00:02:50.330> from<00:02:50.540> experience<00:02:50.660> that<00:02:51.080> that's<00:02:51.290> going

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
know from experience that that's going

00:02:51.410 --> 00:03:01.580 
know from experience that that's going
to<00:02:51.500> burn<00:02:51.680> for<00:02:51.980> somewhere<00:02:52.220> around<00:02:52.340> 13<00:02:52.970> minutes

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
so it's lit will let a prime itself

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.369 
so it's lit will let a prime itself
it'll<00:03:04.620> take<00:03:04.800> about<00:03:04.890> 30<00:03:05.250> seconds<00:03:05.670> I'm<00:03:06.379> just

we're<00:05:13.150> off<00:05:13.300> to<00:05:13.419> the<00:05:13.509> races

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:20.220 

so<00:05:16.750> here<00:05:16.930> we<00:05:16.960> are<00:05:17.139> at<00:05:17.229> 16<00:05:17.620> minutes

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:20.230 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:23.730 

and<00:05:20.800> the<00:05:20.890> Vargas<00:05:21.280> or<00:05:21.750> Fargo<00:05:22.750> is<00:05:22.810> just<00:05:23.350> starting

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:23.740 
and the Vargas or Fargo is just starting

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.140 
and the Vargas or Fargo is just starting
to<00:05:23.770> boil<00:05:25.950> so<00:05:26.950> those<00:05:27.220> results<00:05:27.640> surprised<00:05:27.940> me<00:05:28.120> I

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
to boil so those results surprised me I

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:29.960 
to boil so those results surprised me I
thought<00:05:28.570> this<00:05:28.750> would<00:05:28.870> be<00:05:28.900> a<00:05:28.960> much<00:05:29.170> more

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:29.970 
thought this would be a much more

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:34.110 
thought this would be a much more
efficient<00:05:30.970> stove<00:05:32.280> than<00:05:33.280> the<00:05:33.430> homemade<00:05:33.760> super

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
efficient stove than the homemade super

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:39.450 
efficient stove than the homemade super
cat<00:05:35.310> now<00:05:36.310> I<00:05:36.370> will<00:05:36.580> say<00:05:37.230> this<00:05:38.230> is<00:05:38.440> boiling<00:05:39.190> the

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460 
cat now I will say this is boiling the

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.020 
cat now I will say this is boiling the
water<00:05:39.490> at<00:05:39.970> 16<00:05:40.480> minutes<00:05:40.840> on<00:05:41.730> one<00:05:42.730> and<00:05:42.940> a<00:05:43.000> half

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.030 
water at 16 minutes on one and a half

water at 16 minutes on one and a half
load<00:05:43.390> ounces<00:05:43.810> we're<00:05:44.020> super<00:05:44.470> cat<00:05:44.680> is<00:05:45.430> burning

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:45.910 
load ounces we're super cat is burning

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:49.350 
load ounces we're super cat is burning
two<00:05:46.600> ounces<00:05:46.990> to<00:05:47.260> get<00:05:47.380> the<00:05:47.470> same<00:05:47.620> results<00:05:48.360> this

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 
two ounces to get the same results this

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.940 
two ounces to get the same results this
is<00:05:49.450> definitely<00:05:49.600> burning<00:05:49.930> a<00:05:50.050> lot<00:05:50.200> longer<00:05:50.620> than

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:50.950 
is definitely burning a lot longer than

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.220 
is definitely burning a lot longer than
the<00:05:51.070> super<00:05:51.400> cat<00:05:51.720> I'm<00:05:52.720> have<00:05:52.900> to<00:05:52.960> do<00:05:53.080> some
