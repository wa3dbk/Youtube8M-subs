these<00:00:27.420> work<00:00:27.689> great<00:00:28.019> for<00:00:28.289> emulators<00:00:29.130> on<00:00:29.429> the

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
these work great for emulators on the

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.730 
take the cable out of here I put some
hot<00:01:38.250> glue<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.610> cover<00:01:38.939> up<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.240> hole<00:01:39.450> i<00:01:39.750> route

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
hot glue to cover up the hole i route

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.330 
hot glue to cover up the hole i route
the<00:01:41.700> cable<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.240> here<00:01:42.479> I<00:01:42.509> have<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:43.310> use<00:01:44.310> some

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
the cable to here I have to use some

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.330 
the cable to here I have to use some
wire<00:01:44.759> cutters<00:01:44.790> so<00:01:45.479> I<00:01:45.540> can<00:01:45.750> clip<00:01:46.439> some<00:01:46.770> plastic

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
wire cutters so I can clip some plastic

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.940 
wire cutters so I can clip some plastic
off<00:01:47.549> of<00:01:47.759> here<00:01:48.170> once<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.290> cables<00:01:49.649> in<00:01:49.770> there

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
off of here once the cables in there

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.499 
off of here once the cables in there
it's<00:01:50.070> nice<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.460> centered<00:01:50.820> I'll<00:01:51.149> put<00:01:51.360> some

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
it's nice and centered I'll put some

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.600 
it's nice and centered I'll put some
more<00:01:51.689> hot<00:01:51.899> glue<00:01:51.930> in<00:01:52.350> there<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:53.159> hold<00:01:53.340> it<00:01:53.490> in

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
more hot glue in there to hold it in

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.209 
more hot glue in there to hold it in
place<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:54.210> now<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.600> cable<00:01:55.020> is<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.500> way<00:01:56.100> it

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
place and now the cable is the way it

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.719 
place and now the cable is the way it
should<00:01:56.250> be

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
should be

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.100 
should be
so<00:01:57.570> this<00:01:57.930> is<00:01:58.049> how<00:01:58.140> it<00:01:58.259> comes<00:01:59.780> it's<00:02:00.780> got<00:02:00.960> this

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
so this is how it comes it's got this

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.429 
so this is how it comes it's got this
button<00:02:01.439> here<00:02:01.710> which<00:02:01.890> really<00:02:02.219> does<00:02:02.579> nothing<00:02:03.060> no

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
button here which really does nothing no

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:06.859 
button here which really does nothing no
even<00:02:04.439> once<00:02:04.590> you<00:02:04.680> open<00:02:04.920> it<00:02:04.979> up<00:02:05.100> it<00:02:05.759> just<00:02:06.060> does

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
even once you open it up it just does

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.300 
even once you open it up it just does
nothing<00:02:06.990> it's<00:02:07.290> just<00:02:07.320> a<00:02:07.530> dummy<00:02:08.489> button<00:02:08.989> so<00:02:10.310> I'll

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
nothing it's just a dummy button so I'll

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.010 
nothing it's just a dummy button so I'll
just<00:02:11.520> route<00:02:11.730> this<00:02:11.940> cable

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
just route this cable

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.310 
just route this cable
and<00:02:13.170> this<00:02:13.560> is<00:02:13.710> one<00:02:13.950> that<00:02:14.160> I<00:02:14.190> opened<00:02:14.670> up<00:02:15.110> this<00:02:16.110> is

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
and this is one that I opened up this is

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.740 
and this is one that I opened up this is
actually<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.880> center<00:02:18.240> button<00:02:18.420> there

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
actually the the center button there

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.080 
actually the the center button there
this<00:02:19.680> button<00:02:19.980> here<00:02:20.220> which<00:02:20.630> is<00:02:21.630> just<00:02:21.840> a<00:02:23.090> dummy

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
this button here which is just a dummy

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.820 
this button here which is just a dummy
button<00:02:24.510> this<00:02:25.230> is<00:02:25.380> it

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
button this is it

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.770 
button this is it
it<00:02:26.070> really<00:02:26.340> does<00:02:26.790> nothing<00:02:26.940> nothing<00:02:27.420> is<00:02:27.540> wired

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
it really does nothing nothing is wired

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:34.160 
it really does nothing nothing is wired
to<00:02:27.930> it<00:02:28.490> so<00:02:29.490> once<00:02:29.670> you<00:02:29.790> open<00:02:29.820> it<00:02:30.090> up<00:02:30.180> that<00:02:33.170> button

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
to it so once you open it up that button

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.800 
to it so once you open it up that button
is<00:02:35.360> here<00:02:36.410> and<00:02:37.520> it's<00:02:38.520> just<00:02:38.670> sitting<00:02:39.480> in<00:02:39.600> there

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
is here and it's just sitting in there

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.010 
is here and it's just sitting in there
in<00:02:40.100> that<00:02:41.100> center<00:02:41.460> piece<00:02:41.610> there<00:02:41.910> so<00:02:42.330> I'll<00:02:42.750> just

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
in that center piece there so I'll just

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.370 
in that center piece there so I'll just
unscrew<00:02:43.440> it<00:02:43.470> take<00:02:43.770> it<00:02:43.890> completely<00:02:44.430> off<00:02:44.580> and

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.060 
unscrew it take it completely off and
I'll<00:02:46.380> use<00:02:46.820> where<00:02:47.820> is<00:02:48.000> it<00:02:48.240> these<00:02:49.230> wire<00:02:49.590> cutters

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
I'll use where is it these wire cutters

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.720 
I'll use where is it these wire cutters
here<00:02:50.400> and<00:02:51.300> I'll<00:02:51.450> just<00:02:51.690> clip<00:02:51.990> the<00:02:52.110> plastic<00:02:52.730> make

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730

it<00:02:53.850> a<00:02:53.910> little<00:02:54.090> bit<00:02:54.360> bigger<00:02:55.170> so<00:02:55.500> I<00:02:55.560> can<00:02:55.590> fit<00:02:56.190> the

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
it a little bit bigger so I can fit the

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.790 
it a little bit bigger so I can fit the
cable<00:02:56.640> in<00:02:56.730> there<00:02:56.910> once<00:02:57.180> it's<00:02:57.360> in<00:02:57.510> there<00:02:57.800> I'll

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
cable in there once it's in there I'll

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.610 
cable in there once it's in there I'll
put<00:02:58.980> some<00:02:59.130> hot<00:02:59.310> glue<00:02:59.550> so<00:02:59.850> it<00:03:00.150> won't<00:03:00.300> look<00:03:00.620> that

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
put some hot glue so it won't look that

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.990 
put some hot glue so it won't look that
bad<00:03:02.240> and<00:03:03.560> I'll<00:03:04.560> take<00:03:04.770> this<00:03:04.980> cable<00:03:05.280> here<00:03:05.760> I'll

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
bad and I'll take this cable here I'll

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.420 
bad and I'll take this cable here I'll
just<00:03:06.030> remove<00:03:06.540> it<00:03:06.690> off<00:03:06.810> the<00:03:06.960> sledge<00:03:07.290> I'll<00:03:07.980> route

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.550 
just remove it off the sledge I'll route
it<00:03:08.610> up<00:03:08.730> through<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:09.510> center<00:03:09.630> here<00:03:10.140> I'll<00:03:10.350> put

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
it up through the center here I'll put

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.130 
it up through the center here I'll put
some<00:03:10.830> glue<00:03:11.640> there<00:03:11.910> to<00:03:12.120> hold<00:03:12.300> it<00:03:12.420> in<00:03:12.570> place<00:03:12.750> or

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
some glue there to hold it in place or

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.490 
some glue there to hold it in place or
some<00:03:13.380> black<00:03:13.620> electrical<00:03:13.800> tape<00:03:14.810> so<00:03:15.810> I<00:03:15.870> can<00:03:16.050> stay

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
some black electrical tape so I can stay

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.770 
some black electrical tape so I can stay
still<00:03:16.890> and<00:03:17.340> that's<00:03:18.000> pretty<00:03:18.240> much<00:03:18.360> it<00:03:18.630> this

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
still and that's pretty much it this

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.110 
still and that's pretty much it this
comes<00:03:19.020> right<00:03:19.110> off<00:03:19.340> so<00:03:20.340> it<00:03:20.430> allows<00:03:20.670> you<00:03:20.850> to<00:03:20.940> wrap

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
comes right off so it allows you to wrap

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.449 
comes right off so it allows you to wrap
the<00:03:21.240> cable<00:03:21.540> through<00:03:21.630> there<00:03:21.900> and<00:03:22.890> once<00:03:23.280> it's
