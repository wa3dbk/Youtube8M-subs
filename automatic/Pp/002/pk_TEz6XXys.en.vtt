00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:09.719
 I'm going to tell you that everything is going well 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:13.340
 knowing that I would lie nonsense without 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.780
 that you get up wondering things 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.420
 you have hit you start to feel like 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:22.140
 shit though apparently all 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.269
 be well and everything is in order I wanted 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.609
 tell you that everything is going well and that it does not happen 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.619
 nothing but you know mind there are so many things 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.720
 that I do not like today, so I write 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.910
 in case one day I smile and forget that my 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.530
 memory did not damage what I have lived 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.570
 bad days watching my brothers 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.730
 looking for tickets because the pasta 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.829
 defies tightens the shackles when 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.870
 this unjust hierarchy submits us and 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.210
 although smile you know that your eyes say 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.250
 front so he faced life such as 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.530
 come I know it's a lie but I answer 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.899
 all penis because my mother never gave 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.210
 for lost is in his DNA and his son 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.430
 It has large balls and good genes 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.859
 Sometimes the clock costs three times 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.079
 when you go to bed I have work but 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.969
 subtract then ask me why the 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.619
 owner protests why time passes and 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.619
 the life I was hoping was not this 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:15.500
 we keep going, letting the years go by 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:18.050
 thinking that everything will change you know 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.090
 they all start with a girlfriend plan 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.730
 floor read the newspaper buy the bread 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.350
 happy until the storm comes and 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.540
 visit the quarrels with your relative 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.850
 because the accounts do not balance times 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.979
 you take air begging for a break but 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.350
 nobody hears your inner self screaming measure 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.330
 the design of the system is a problem that 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.340
 it hurts us because we are flies putting 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.380
 eggs in cobwebs waiting for 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.970
 someone fears for us but the boat 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.850
 it sank we're swimming between 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.340
 broken glass in the short term seems not to 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.710
 have exit and apparently perish is the 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.110
 base of life we are only 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.509
 puppets waiting for the 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.580
 curtain behind that curtain unconscious of 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:59.020
 that if we cut that thin string we 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:01.450
 we would rid ourselves of the threads that hold us 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.759
 you start asking 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:07.060
 how could they have changed so much 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:09.459
 things you know we've gone from 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.920
 what to this the problem is in 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.540
 we like in a sick and change 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.550
 of the others it is not possible but a 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.130
 internal change yesterday flew carrero-blanco 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.260
 today we do careers without a plan here 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.750
 Do not fuck the bank and hercog and masters 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.360
 the rifle we shouted will not happen today 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.430
 we paid their summers in yucatÃ¡n yesterday 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.530
 we fought for something worthy today we 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.620
 we killed for a place on the track of 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.540
 circus yesterday we fight for welfare today 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.910
 the obsession to win subjects us to no 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.099
 protest the jar of knowledge is emptied and 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.200
 It was full of fashions so tell me how 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:43.420
 feed your soul now and if you gave 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.220
 realize that nothing is what it was and that 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.230
 we're just a hamster running inside 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.989
 of your wheel and that your life is a role to 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:54.130
 that you gird yourself and that everyone was nothing in the 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:56.459
 day in which the fights then do not 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.959
 there will be a reverse 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:03.220
 so start asking if you're 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:05.799
 ready for the change boy because nothing 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:10.379
 will change if you do not throw the first 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:15.840
 stone you do not take the first step so I'm 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:15.840
 sad as the life of any other not 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.730
 ah
