weights first what I think is a lot of

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.659 
weights first what I think is a lot of
times<00:00:30.960> people<00:00:31.410> will<00:00:31.529> come<00:00:31.590> up<00:00:31.859> with<00:00:32.009> excuses

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
why not to exercise with weights they'll

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.250 
why not to exercise with weights they'll
either<00:00:35.040> do<00:00:35.340> let's<00:00:35.640> say<00:00:35.760> some<00:00:36.000> running<00:00:36.360> Pilates

underneath<00:02:31.290> there<00:02:31.500> so<00:02:31.680> even<00:02:32.010> if<00:02:32.100> you<00:02:32.220> think

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
underneath there so even if you think

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.770 
underneath there so even if you think
like<00:02:32.610> oh<00:02:32.700> my<00:02:32.880> legs<00:02:33.090> have<00:02:33.240> a<00:02:33.270> big<00:02:33.510> butt<00:02:33.690> or

actually<00:02:36.180> bogus<00:02:36.750> you<00:02:37.140> have<00:02:37.260> to<00:02:37.380> strip<00:02:37.740> away

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
actually bogus you have to strip away

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.560 
actually bogus you have to strip away
all<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.220> fat<00:02:38.550> to<00:02:38.730> actually<00:02:39.090> find<00:02:39.360> out<00:02:39.510> what

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
all the fat to actually find out what

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.240 
all the fat to actually find out what
you're<00:02:39.840> left<00:02:40.080> with<00:02:40.230> and<00:02:40.650> while<00:02:40.800> most<00:02:41.010> people

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
you're left with and while most people

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.980 
you're left with and while most people
will<00:02:41.550> find<00:02:41.790> when<00:02:42.270> they<00:02:42.390> strip<00:02:42.600> away<00:02:42.630> all<00:02:42.810> the

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
will find when they strip away all the

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.810 
will find when they strip away all the
fact<00:02:43.320> is<00:02:43.530> they<00:02:43.680> didn't<00:02:43.920> have<00:02:43.950> any<00:02:44.310> muscle<00:02:44.760> to

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
fact is they didn't have any muscle to

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.580 
fact is they didn't have any muscle to
begin<00:02:45.090> with<00:02:45.270> in<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.480> first<00:02:45.660> place<00:02:45.810> and<00:02:46.110> it<00:02:46.500> was

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
begin with in the first place and it was

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.620 
begin with in the first place and it was
all<00:02:46.830> just<00:02:47.190> them<00:02:47.400> perceiving<00:02:48.180> that<00:02:48.300> they<00:02:48.450> had

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
all just them perceiving that they had

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.510 
all just them perceiving that they had
too<00:02:48.810> much<00:02:48.960> muscle<00:02:49.230> and<00:02:49.650> one<00:02:49.860> area<00:02:50.070> of<00:02:50.370> their

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
too much muscle and one area of their

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.490 
too much muscle and one area of their
body<00:02:50.580> so<00:02:51.090> the<00:02:51.210> bottom<00:02:51.570> line<00:02:51.600> about<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.230> idea

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
body so the bottom line about the idea

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.410 
body so the bottom line about the idea
of<00:02:52.620> being<00:02:52.800> too<00:02:52.980> bulky<00:02:53.190> in<00:02:53.490> certain<00:02:53.820> areas<00:02:54.060> lose

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
of being too bulky in certain areas lose

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.240 
of being too bulky in certain areas lose
all<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:54.840> fat<00:02:55.020> that<00:02:55.050> you<00:02:55.380> need<00:02:55.530> to<00:02:55.650> lose<00:02:55.830> and<00:02:56.040> if

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
all the fat that you need to lose and if

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.890 
all the fat that you need to lose and if
you<00:02:56.370> think<00:02:56.580> you<00:02:56.670> gotta<00:02:56.850> lose<00:02:57.060> 5<00:02:57.240> pounds<00:02:57.480> trust

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
you think you gotta lose 5 pounds trust

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.220 
you think you gotta lose 5 pounds trust
me<00:02:58.020> it's<00:02:58.110> more<00:02:58.230> like<00:02:58.380> 8<00:02:58.620> 10<00:02:58.950> or<00:02:59.010> maybe<00:02:59.280> 12<00:02:59.580> 15

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
me it's more like 8 10 or maybe 12 15

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.630 
me it's more like 8 10 or maybe 12 15
