00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 now you have to look at this part of 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.490
 the rubber must always be 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.280
 horizontal for example there is more the 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.050
 supports because he is not playing in a pure 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.590
 tip and that's wrong or if it's not all 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:16.340
 let's say support for the stamping then 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.910
 we regulate it 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:23.940
 wants to be in horizontal form 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:28.800
 it is appreciated already saw a day 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:32.510
 and there it points more and there we would be in 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.510
 conditions already to be able to stamp 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:38.719
 this and support it only with the hand 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:41.430
 to give it a light support and pull with 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:43.720
 the hand the party 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.950
 maybe I would choose 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.950
 I did not understand 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.650
 much that is all and whoever presents 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:00.510
 and never forget the position one 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.809
 pure position so that all pencils 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.809
 same 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.470
 and we're not going to pass the print 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:11.509
 because we have the supports in the top is 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:14.659
 impossible that you love to be made two 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:16.970
 times the stamping on the pencil because 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:20.290
 we have the adjustments 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.290
 let's try with others 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.430
 whenever you really have to have the 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.150
 clip 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.150
 out there 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.120
 here is a smaller compliment to 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:38.340
 justly 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.340
 have good support 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:49.550
 adjusted and it 's the same principle 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.550
 the one of kristen Latin and to a low function 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.660
 and guide the entry to them 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.789
 we put down we support with one hand 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:04.110
 right and with the left hand 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:04.110
 we turn fast 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:09.640
 this is obviously with paint 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.040
 10 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.970
 the position that the mesh has to go 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.970
 to stamp the lips
