00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:06.319
 hello guys well found at our 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.300
 weekly whatsapp video today 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:10.110
 in the exclusive laryngitis edition only 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.030
 for you 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.400
 let's start with a news story about the 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.500
 microsoft world and why xbox one has 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.690
 recently celebrated his first 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.640
 year of life and microsoft has thought well 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.010
 to reward all those who have 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.019
 purchased a xbox one a day console 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.810
 one or in the following days with a game 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.340
 in free game in question is limbo 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.949
 wonderful title released a few years ago 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.660
 and recently appeared in the catalog 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.370
 of xbox one 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.980
 well it seems that not everyone is 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.450
 managed to download it because of how much 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.700
 apparently this problem does not concern 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.629
 italy goes to other states i said 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:48.450
 apparently in some states it is 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:52.230
 impossible to send in promotional e 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.730
 gifts without a specific authorization 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.000
 this obviously prevented 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.829
 Microsoft to send the gift to many 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.949
 users who have remained dry-mouthed 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.949
 and cannot download the game a 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.840
 times the bureaucracy studied for 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.260
 protect privacy protect from 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.200
 spam 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.299
 create some inconvenience we pass sony 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.250
 who is preparing to playstation 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.950
 experience event to be held i 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.350
 next 6 and 7 December in which 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.430
 some news should be revealed 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.220
 for 2015 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.430
 it is known that he will be present at the david event 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.009
 jack that one of the creators of god of war 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.130
 as well as one of the creators of twisted metal 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:35.100
 his presence gives hope for a 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.350
 announcement of the utmost importance therefore vi 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.240
 we recommend following the event 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.460
 we will be present both at the Milan event 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.799
 than what will be held in London 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.290
 so stay connected on space 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.479
 for all the news coming from 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.100
 playstation experience 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.200
 we remain in the sony context because this 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.700
 week did a lot of discussion 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.850
 removal of an advertising spot 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.090
 dedicated to playstation life on the air 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.420
 in the United States 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.670
 this advertising spot with 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.850
 starring Dr. Jochen Berg 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:09.250
 he spoke of masturbation or at least 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.470
 made a strange parallelism between the 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.940
 masturbation playstation life using a 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.730
 lots of double senses and at the end 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.080
 revealing that that thing you touch that 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.629
 use handkerchiefs and make you become 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.450
 blind in the end was the playstation life 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:25.269
 this thing did go on all the 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.129
 furious American Puritans who 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:30.099
 obviously they asked immediately 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:31.780
 and got the removal immediately 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:33.690
 of this spot we frankly it 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.700
 we have seen we are nothing 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.750
 particularly striking are the Americans 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.269
 they make big sticks 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.440
 then there are people who are killed 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:43.930
 on the street because he has guns 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.700
 toy but ok let's not forget it 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.400
 this is the place where we deal with 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.540
 these sterile polemics 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.250
 let's move to ubisoft that this week 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.140
 has released a very important one 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.700
 update for his assassin's 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.829
 creed ii united update that 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.530
 should solve the problems of 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:00.640
 framerate of which the game suffered 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.840
 lot 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.000
 well someone noticed that later 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.859
 the installation of this face are 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.090
 strange things happened in 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:08.730
 particular seems to have been 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.250
 downgraded 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:15.130
 on game lighting only in 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.209
 some breakers not say across the 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.459
 game and this obviously did 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.079
 enrage many people because 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:23.700
 they rightly say why 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:26.769
 release a game beyond capabilities 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.780
 of the console and then by a credit later 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:31.060
 that you have sold it in short there are 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.280
 there is still great controversy 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.519
 real fuss around the 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.799
 ubisoft french house on his side ha 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:41.079
 tried to apologize and did it 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:43.090
 giving a game to those who already have 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:45.370
 purchased the assassin's season pass 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.349
 creed ii united and not the usual ones 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.970
 play games but lots of games 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:51.609
 important among downloadable games 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.829
 for free there is also let cry 4 that is 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:56.650
 so very recently came out 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:04:00.310
 in short, let's say ubisoft seeks to 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.100
 repay some of its users though 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.720
 obviously 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.510
 the controversy naturally remains 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:08.240
 we will follow the evolution of the story and vi 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.580
 we will keep you informed in the next we stay 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.320
 on the subject of peace and let's talk about drive clubs 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.960
 title that was hunted countless 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:17.330
 times and that slowly seems to resolve 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:19.730
 your own problems related to online in 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:21.620
 particular with the release of the patch 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.820
 of this week 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.740
 the manufacturer of the game has 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.480
 tried to justify himself by saying that it is 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.440
 practically impossible to know how 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.020
 behave 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.910
 the online before the release of a game 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.340
 because obviously when the 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.920
 game is released and therefore is 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:39.740
 usable by a huge mass of people 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:42.500
 it can happen to any point that we 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.960
 we ask ourselves, what the hell do you need? 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.340
 beta why do the beta if 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.800
 they are of no use and it is not possible 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.400
 not even check the stability of the 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.550
 server 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:55.460
 let's remember that drive clubs did not have 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:58.580
 a massive beta like so many other games 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.290
 that came out with working online 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.120
 so maybe that is the problem had 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:04.610
 the lack of tests 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.650
 we'll see if it actually does 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.460
 things will improve naturally there 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.710
 we will keep you informed 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.940
 this was also the week of a 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.610
 great announcement tell the truth 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:16.850
 quite unexpected we talk about dark 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:19.670
 souls 2 scola of the first since that is 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:22.700
 reissue also for new consoles 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:23.630
 classic generation came out this 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.430
 spring 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:28.160
 obviously dark souls two was a 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:30.350
 beloved title and we are happy that 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.730
 also arrive on new consoles 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.950
 generation we have to see 

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:36.260
 actually what will be the quality of 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:38.810
 porting must be said that at least in the 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:40.940
 passage gen only 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:42.530
 apc this time a job was done 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:45.260
 so at least decent we can 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:46.220
 expect something similar too 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.470
 next gen 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:50.090
 we are really very very interested 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:51.030
 to the title and expect it for the 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:53.830
 next year 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:56.139
 that's good for this week too 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.849
 the appointment with a new whatsapp e 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:06:00.300
 we hope again with my voice is for 

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:00.300
 next Saturday
