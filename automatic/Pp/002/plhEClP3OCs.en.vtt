that kind of gradually gets louder

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.340 
that kind of gradually gets louder
before<00:02:36.820> exploding<00:02:37.300> I<00:02:37.570> mean<00:02:37.720> we've<00:02:37.870> all<00:02:38.080> heard

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
before exploding I mean we've all heard

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.440 
before exploding I mean we've all heard
that<00:02:38.470> in<00:02:38.650> a<00:02:38.740> Breaking<00:02:39.130> Benjamin<00:02:39.340> track<00:02:40.060> before

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
maybe I can't help but like it it's

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.510 
maybe I can't help but like it it's

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
is another one of those tracks that's

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.180 
is another one of those tracks that's
heavily<00:03:01.390> influenced<00:03:01.989> by<00:03:02.050> their<00:03:02.410> past<00:03:02.800> work

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
heavily influenced by their past work

instrumental sounding like a mixture of
Breaking<00:03:09.730> Benjamin<00:03:10.030> and<00:03:10.480> red<00:03:11.019> which<00:03:11.320> is<00:03:11.350> no

this<00:04:56.469> tract<00:04:56.770> feels<00:04:57.069> even<00:04:57.370> though<00:04:57.580> it<00:04:57.699> is<00:04:57.819> much

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
this tract feels even though it is much

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:59.939 
this tract feels even though it is much
more<00:04:58.599> reserved<00:04:59.110> in<00:04:59.379> terms<00:04:59.650> of<00:04:59.800> its

more reserved in terms of its

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:01.649 
more reserved in terms of its
instrumental<00:05:00.759> it's<00:05:00.909> not<00:05:01.090> something<00:05:01.539> that's

00:05:01.649 --> 00:05:01.659 
instrumental it's not something that's

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:03.629 
instrumental it's not something that's
going<00:05:01.810> to<00:05:01.870> be<00:05:02.020> full<00:05:02.529> of<00:05:02.680> explosive<00:05:03.250> guitars

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:03.639 
going to be full of explosive guitars

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:05.700 
going to be full of explosive guitars
and<00:05:03.969> it<00:05:04.120> doesn't<00:05:04.599> need<00:05:04.930> to<00:05:05.259> I<00:05:05.409> love<00:05:05.590> the

off<00:05:53.830> believable<00:05:54.699> the<00:05:54.879> majority<00:05:55.449> of<00:05:55.539> the<00:05:55.659> time

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:55.899 
off believable the majority of the time

00:05:55.899 --> 00:05:57.300 
off believable the majority of the time
when<00:05:56.110> he<00:05:56.259> writes<00:05:56.469> about<00:05:56.620> these<00:05:56.889> subjects

when he writes about these subjects

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.760

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:04.230 
conflict and everything in this man's
life<00:06:01.960> but<00:06:02.379> he<00:06:02.529> still<00:06:02.889> sees<00:06:03.189> himself<00:06:03.370> as<00:06:03.699> kind

life but he still sees himself as kind

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.450 
life but he still sees himself as kind
of<00:06:04.330> overcoming<00:06:05.050> this<00:06:05.289> that's<00:06:05.529> why<00:06:05.680> I<00:06:05.710> do<00:06:05.889> enjoy

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:06.460 
of overcoming this that's why I do enjoy

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.600 
of overcoming this that's why I do enjoy
the<00:06:07.270> concept<00:06:07.960> of<00:06:08.080> this<00:06:08.289> album<00:06:08.349> while<00:06:09.039> all<00:06:09.310> of

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:09.610 
the concept of this album while all of

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:11.760 
the concept of this album while all of
the<00:06:09.699> tracks<00:06:09.969> do<00:06:10.360> not<00:06:10.569> play<00:06:10.810> out<00:06:10.839> for<00:06:11.199> me<00:06:11.349> it's

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:11.770 
the tracks do not play out for me it's

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.519 
the tracks do not play out for me it's
something<00:06:12.069> that<00:06:12.639> I<00:06:12.849> still<00:06:13.360> find<00:06:13.659> enjoyable

00:06:14.519 --> 00:06:14.529 
something that I still find enjoyable

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:16.679 
something that I still find enjoyable
enough<00:06:14.860> and<00:06:15.159> some<00:06:15.370> aspects<00:06:15.879> and<00:06:16.060> I<00:06:16.180> think<00:06:16.479> that

00:06:16.679 --> 00:06:16.689 
enough and some aspects and I think that

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:18.629 
enough and some aspects and I think that
maybe<00:06:17.050> some<00:06:17.649> of<00:06:17.680> it<00:06:17.889> and<00:06:18.009> maybe<00:06:18.399> even

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:18.639 
maybe some of it and maybe even

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:20.850 
maybe some of it and maybe even
occasionally<00:06:19.389> I<00:06:19.419> will<00:06:19.599> revisit<00:06:20.199> this<00:06:20.469> album

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:20.860 
occasionally I will revisit this album

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.769 
occasionally I will revisit this album
it's<00:06:21.099> by<00:06:21.279> no<00:06:21.339> means<00:06:21.669> the<00:06:21.879> best<00:06:22.419> in<00:06:22.629> their

00:06:22.769 --> 00:06:22.779 
it's by no means the best in their

00:06:22.779 --> 00:06:24.450 
it's by no means the best in their
discography<00:06:23.080> but<00:06:23.860> I<00:06:23.889> would<00:06:24.129> give<00:06:24.310> it<00:06:24.399> a

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:24.460 
discography but I would give it a

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.369

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:29.889 
of conflicted on it because like I said

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:32.189 
of conflicted on it because like I said
I<00:06:30.250> enjoy<00:06:30.789> some<00:06:31.060> of<00:06:31.089> the<00:06:31.240> lyrical<00:06:31.629> content<00:06:31.779> but

00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:32.199 
I enjoy some of the lyrical content but

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:33.990 
I enjoy some of the lyrical content but
at<00:06:32.289> the<00:06:32.379> same<00:06:32.529> time<00:06:32.800> a<00:06:33.009> lot<00:06:33.460> of<00:06:33.490> it<00:06:33.759> feels

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:34.000 
at the same time a lot of it feels

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.149

recycled<00:06:34.569> a<00:06:34.629> lot<00:06:34.779> of<00:06:34.930> the<00:06:35.020> riffs<00:06:35.259> feel<00:06:35.589> really

00:06:36.149 --> 00:06:36.159 
recycled a lot of the riffs feel really

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:38.699 
recycled a lot of the riffs feel really
really<00:06:36.750> all-too-familiar<00:06:37.750> and<00:06:38.289> I'm<00:06:38.379> not<00:06:38.529> that

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:38.709

really all-too-familiar and I'm not that
happy<00:06:39.069> about<00:06:39.099> that<00:06:39.519> so<00:06:40.000> overall<00:06:40.449> I'm<00:06:40.779> kind<00:06:41.379> of

00:06:41.459 --> 00:06:41.469 
happy about that so overall I'm kind of
