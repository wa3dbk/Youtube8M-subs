and it is quite profitable right now

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.060 
and it is quite profitable right now
possibly<00:00:18.210> because<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.750> market<00:00:19.109> is<00:00:19.230> kind<00:00:19.980> of

possibly because the market is kind of

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.859 
possibly because the market is kind of
fluctuating<00:00:20.490> after<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:20.910> bonus<00:00:21.180> xp<00:00:21.510> weekend

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
so the requirements to do this method

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.439

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
which is the rate that I got in this

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.520 
which is the rate that I got in this
video<00:00:58.859> then<00:00:59.760> that<00:00:59.940> equates<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.780> loss<00:01:01.350> of

profit of 700 per dragonhide and of
course<00:01:31.049> because<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:32.400> do<00:01:34.280> so<00:01:35.390> 700<00:01:36.390> GP<00:01:36.890> /<00:01:37.890> hide<00:01:38.189> x

tens five hides at a time x 950 casper
our<00:01:48.500> equates<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.649> about<00:01:50.810> 3.3<00:01:51.810> too<00:01:51.990> well

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
our equates to about 3.3 too well

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.380 
our equates to about 3.3 too well

five mil GP per hour and if you subtract

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.859 
five mil GP per hour and if you subtract
the<00:02:00.049> 675<00:02:01.049> k<00:02:01.860> from<00:02:02.310> that<00:02:02.549> then<00:02:03.329> you<00:02:03.450> get<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.630> net

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
the 675 k from that then you get a net

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.830 
the 675 k from that then you get a net
of<00:02:04.020> about<00:02:04.380> two<00:02:04.649> point<00:02:04.860> six<00:02:05.219> five<00:02:05.369> mil<00:02:05.820> GP<00:02:06.450> per

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.370 
hour and the XP also isn't too bad i did
get<00:02:11.970> about<00:02:12.239> 7k

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
get about 7k

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.190 
get about 7k
in<00:02:13.470> five<00:02:14.010> minutes<00:02:14.390> so<00:02:15.390> that<00:02:15.420> equates<00:02:15.900> to<00:02:16.080> an

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
the GP and XP rates can be a little bit

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.010 
the GP and XP rates can be a little bit
better<00:02:23.190> because<00:02:23.430> my<00:02:24.000> banking<00:02:24.600> wasn't<00:02:24.930> too

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
for lower to mid level players or just

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.880 
for lower to mid level players or just
anyone<00:02:34.830> that<00:02:35.870> you<00:02:36.870> know<00:02:36.900> wants<00:02:37.470> to<00:02:37.560> kill<00:02:37.740> some

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
anyone that you know wants to kill some

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.840 
anyone that you know wants to kill some
time<00:02:38.040> and<00:02:38.310> make<00:02:38.460> some<00:02:38.850> pretty<00:02:39.150> good<00:02:39.360> money<00:02:40.850> so

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
time and make some pretty good money so

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.460 
time and make some pretty good money so
yeah<00:02:42.000> the<00:02:42.450> alivet<00:02:42.750> farm<00:02:42.930> requirement<00:02:43.350> isn't

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
yeah the alivet farm requirement isn't

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.920 
yeah the alivet farm requirement isn't
too<00:02:43.710> bad<00:02:43.890> just<00:02:44.160> because<00:02:44.310> I<00:02:44.910> imagine<00:02:45.480> that<00:02:45.900> a

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
too bad just because I imagine that a

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.690 
too bad just because I imagine that a
lot<00:02:46.140> of<00:02:46.230> players<00:02:46.680> are<00:02:46.980> aiming<00:02:47.280> for<00:02:47.670> that

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
lot of players are aiming for that

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.910 
lot of players are aiming for that
completion<00:02:48.180> escape<00:02:48.630> so<00:02:48.930> if<00:02:49.470> you<00:02:49.560> already<00:02:49.680> have

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
completion escape so if you already have

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.010 
completion escape so if you already have
the<00:02:49.950> requirement<00:02:50.460> done<00:02:50.580> great<00:02:50.940> and<00:02:51.270> if<00:02:51.930> you

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
the requirement done great and if you

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.990 
the requirement done great and if you
haven't<00:02:52.290> gotten<00:02:53.130> it<00:02:53.220> done<00:02:53.340> yet<00:02:53.580> you're

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
haven't gotten it done yet you're

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.220 
haven't gotten it done yet you're
probably<00:02:54.210> going<00:02:54.450> to<00:02:54.540> have<00:02:54.630> to<00:02:54.720> do<00:02:54.900> it<00:02:55.050> for

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
probably going to have to do it for

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.380 
probably going to have to do it for
completion<00:02:55.650> just<00:02:55.830> cape<00:02:55.950> anyways<00:02:56.370> so<00:02:57.120> might<00:02:57.300> as

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
completion just cape anyways so might as

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.790 
completion just cape anyways so might as

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.930 
which I assume that put a strain on most
