00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:59.800
 I know that you see what we are going to 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.860
 carry the equipment that we use 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.050
 as usual it is already a custom 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.630
 first open the suitcase come open the 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.950
 there we go showing things for things we 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.189
 We will take 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.289
 we bought a new microphone for the 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:17.329
 camera true the camera that goes up 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:20.299
 all that I want to show you here a 

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:23.329
 road is a microphone that goes above the 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:26.590
 camera like a chat johann so let's go 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:26.590
 to go uncovering 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.460
 I think that good of so many 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.560
 times we had never agreed 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.080
 we had been able to buy a suitcase for 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.260
 the equipment but since it was not moving 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.400
 I checked changüí we bought the closure 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.660
 with the intention of having this a bit 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.280
 more organized everything will be 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.630
 here is going to be in this suitcase then 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.870
 in this way we want to show them 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.970
 the suitcase a theme that all these 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:55.560
 simple to organize lens camera 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:57.510
 tripod put the memory all that is us 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.460
 we will be saying each name but 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.680
 everything that we are showing here is going to 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.420
 be in the store here below in 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.830

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.490
 you want it 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.080
 I have this canon here but it is 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.060
 only for them to see but I do not think 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.400
 It's the canon that I'm going to take but it's 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.510

 that we buy this is a guy with a 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.340
 little more practical is a roe of equal being 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.710
 we will receive in the description this 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.840
 goes on top of the camera in the part of 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.850
 here to make it a little easier to the 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.980
 time to be recording and make blogs 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.450
 this really is one of the best 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.640
 microphones that is one of the best that 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.470
 there is for this type of work when 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.600
 to put a camera and has recommended 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.300
 down here in the description we're going to 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.920
 subtract the air link that is a microphone 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.440
 that when I open it I'm talking 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.110
 at the same time I 'm writing down and 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.970
 well there you are seeing a little bit of good 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.500
 I'm going there and the same as me 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.480
 I would have a band and Gabriel will be talking 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.239
 we are already carrying our 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.209
 sound recorder that we are using it 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:29.800
 right now as you can see it is not so 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.780
 high because I'm not going to move it or anything 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.459
 and to record of sounds microphone the 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.320
 microphone in the vall gear that is 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:41.060
 using gabriela here is a lav aller 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:43.670
 they are and also goes with us we have 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.260
 and from the new tripod for the camera 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.370
 what are we going to be using let's see 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:51.410
 how are we going to do it 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:53.060
 we give a Martian the movement in 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.099
 this guy is that apart that is very 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.620
 comfortable to wear and it's small 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:59.450
 this is a gorilla pad you can flip 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.640
 and put it on any surface that 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.530
 you want on the ground or put it on 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.730
 a tube or something and when we 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.319
 we travel as chosen victor take us 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.390
 the tripod that we usually love 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:11.150
 It's a bit complicated when it comes to being 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.890
 at port time because it's much more already 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.440
 it's a tripod also where it takes 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.470
 for is something like that for a possible 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.479
 then let this be a little bit more 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:24.919
 we buy this new go pro and we have 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:26.330
 here a monkey for a dollar for the go pro I know 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:27.979
 that we are going to be using the coproté the 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.320
 link down here also from lombok zinc 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:32.419
 what we did and we have several tics shows 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.760
 to annoy short who does not want 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:37.040
 I got this message for campus 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.810
 party but if we are going to take it too 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.639
 I want to tell you that we are going to take a lot 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.550
 stick so if you see us it tells you 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:44.960
 I am a Martian sticker me not only 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.460
 let's give breathe each of the 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:52.810
 marziano we see 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:52.810
 this is a wing booster ok for the breeze 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:56.290
 s 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:03.710
 that what we have battery by the 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:06.020
 battery also the microphone for 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.880
 try it to see how it sounds all go to 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.020
 be watching in review mode in the 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.789
 videos that we're going to be doing everything 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:14.030
 what we are using we have these 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:15.500
 speaker who sent it to us from amazon 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.750
 I think it was summer 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.000
 because in the hotel where we are going to be 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:22.639
 we do not have music only from the 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.990
 laptop with this amplifies a little bit more 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:27.319
 Sound 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:29.539
 we have the laptop in a memory laptop 

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:31.039
 and let's see how organizing all this 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:33.530
 on the other side you can also put 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:35.870
 tripod know to have another option of is 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:37.820
 but what good thing we need to bring 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:40.849
 enough the feast to annoy 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:43.610
 cazorla is battery can not miss a 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:45.050
 battery on a trip like this 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:48.050
 the cover that I have to do the 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:50.479

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:59.080
 organize this here 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:18.000
 lists guys like that ended 16 minutes 

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:20.159

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.289
 video be good editing video that we're going 

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:24.149

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:27.869
 good boy here are all things 

00:06:24.149 --> 00:06:29.550
 inside the suitcase hopefully we do not miss 

00:06:27.869 --> 00:06:31.319
 nothing however in the other suitcases of 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:33.330
