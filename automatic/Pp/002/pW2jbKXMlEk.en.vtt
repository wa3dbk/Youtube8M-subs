going to do hanging knee crunches

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.890 
going to do hanging knee crunches
because<00:00:11.010> let's<00:00:11.280> face<00:00:11.370> it<00:00:11.550> we<00:00:11.969> all<00:00:12.000> have<00:00:12.210> a

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
because let's face it we all have a

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.530 
because let's face it we all have a
problem<00:00:13.110> developing<00:00:13.830> our<00:00:14.429> lower<00:00:14.759> abdominal

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
problem developing our lower abdominal

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.039 
problem developing our lower abdominal
region

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
region

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.099 
region
now<00:00:16.350> that's<00:00:16.710> for<00:00:17.100> two<00:00:17.250> reasons<00:00:17.279> one<00:00:18.109> that's

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
now that's for two reasons one that's

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.050 
now that's for two reasons one that's
where<00:00:19.350> body<00:00:19.680> fat<00:00:19.890> accumulates<00:00:20.490> you<00:00:20.760> know<00:00:20.880> in

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
where body fat accumulates you know in

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.060 
where body fat accumulates you know in
men<00:00:21.300> or<00:00:21.539> you<00:00:21.779> fatty<00:00:22.020> tends<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:22.619> accumulate

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
men or you fatty tends to accumulate

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.490 
men or you fatty tends to accumulate
around<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.150> center<00:00:24.570> of<00:00:24.689> gravity<00:00:25.170> which<00:00:25.320> as

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
around the center of gravity which as

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.230 
around the center of gravity which as
they're<00:00:25.710> labeled<00:00:26.130> so<00:00:26.490> you<00:00:26.519> get<00:00:26.820> this<00:00:26.939> kind<00:00:27.180> of

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
they're labeled so you get this kind of

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.140 
they're labeled so you get this kind of
tire<00:00:27.599> like<00:00:28.099> accumulation<00:00:29.099> of<00:00:29.220> body<00:00:29.429> fat<00:00:29.670> which

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
tire like accumulation of body fat which

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.810 
tire like accumulation of body fat which

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
the most amount of work which for me

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.819 
the most amount of work which for me
anyway<00:01:18.429> is<00:01:18.880> bringing<00:01:19.810> the<00:01:19.899> hips<00:01:20.109> forwards<00:01:20.649> and

anyway is bringing the hips forwards and
engaging<00:01:21.159> the<00:01:21.460> lower<00:01:21.609> abdominals<00:01:22.359> so<00:01:23.109> you<00:01:23.679> can

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:23.859 
engaging the lower abdominals so you can

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:26.340 
engaging the lower abdominals so you can
do<00:01:23.979> this<00:01:24.159> one<00:01:24.549> of<00:01:24.789> two<00:01:24.909> ways<00:01:25.420> really<00:01:25.810> do

harm started a so it depends if you're
quite<00:01:52.000> an<00:01:52.209> advanced<00:01:53.079> trainer<00:01:53.770> then<00:01:54.549> you<00:01:55.090> can

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
quite an advanced trainer then you can

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.749 
quite an advanced trainer then you can
maybe<00:01:55.420> do<00:01:55.659> 50<00:01:56.079> and<00:01:56.200> 20<00:01:56.500> repetitions<00:01:56.759> arm

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
maybe do 50 and 20 repetitions arm

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:59.999 
maybe do 50 and 20 repetitions arm
straight<00:01:58.209> and<00:01:58.450> really<00:01:58.689> involve<00:01:59.500> all<00:01:59.770> of<00:01:59.799> the

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
straight and really involve all of the

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.089 
straight and really involve all of the
abdominal<00:02:00.159> muscles<00:02:00.909> but<00:02:01.719> if<00:02:01.989> you're<00:02:02.679> like<00:02:02.829> me

00:02:03.089 --> 00:02:03.099 
abdominal muscles but if you're like me

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:05.309 
abdominal muscles but if you're like me
I<00:02:03.280> like<00:02:03.459> high<00:02:03.729> repetitions<00:02:04.420> I<00:02:04.599> do<00:02:04.719> sometimes

00:02:05.309 --> 00:02:05.319 
I like high repetitions I do sometimes

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:08.789 
I like high repetitions I do sometimes
up<00:02:05.590> to<00:02:05.619> 50<00:02:06.280> repetitions<00:02:06.879> of<00:02:07.509> hanging<00:02:08.289> me<00:02:08.410> roses

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:08.799 
up to 50 repetitions of hanging me roses

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:11.220 
up to 50 repetitions of hanging me roses
now<00:02:09.310> I<00:02:09.519> can't<00:02:09.789> do<00:02:10.000> 50<00:02:10.390> if<00:02:10.479> I<00:02:10.599> hold<00:02:10.810> on<00:02:10.929> with<00:02:11.079> my

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
now I can't do 50 if I hold on with my

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.559 
now I can't do 50 if I hold on with my
arm<00:02:11.410> so<00:02:11.709> this<00:02:12.400> is<00:02:12.579> where<00:02:12.819> the<00:02:12.940> arm<00:02:13.090> supports

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
arm so this is where the arm supports

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.690 
arm so this is where the arm supports
really<00:02:13.840> come<00:02:14.140> into<00:02:14.290> their<00:02:14.410> own<00:02:14.620> and<00:02:14.950> allow<00:02:15.549> me

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
really come into their own and allow me

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.479 
really come into their own and allow me
to<00:02:15.730> engage<00:02:16.030> and<00:02:16.569> use<00:02:16.810> my<00:02:17.079> ab<00:02:17.290> muscles<00:02:17.560> instead

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
to engage and use my ab muscles instead

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.699 
to engage and use my ab muscles instead
of<00:02:18.579> relying<00:02:18.879> on<00:02:19.120> my<00:02:19.360> grip<00:02:19.629> so<00:02:20.170> let<00:02:20.410> me<00:02:20.470> show<00:02:20.650> you

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
of relying on my grip so let me show you

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:29.180 
of relying on my grip so let me show you
how<00:02:20.889> to

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:03:26.740 

you

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.150 

okay<00:03:27.750> so<00:03:27.810> as<00:03:28.110> you<00:03:28.140> can<00:03:28.380> see<00:03:28.560> I'm<00:03:28.710> keeping<00:03:28.920> my

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
okay so as you can see I'm keeping my

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.030 
okay so as you can see I'm keeping my
upper<00:03:29.430> body<00:03:29.760> free<00:03:30.420> Richard<00:03:30.900> and<00:03:31.080> one<00:03:31.650> doing<00:03:31.950> it

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
upper body free Richard and one doing it

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.160 
upper body free Richard and one doing it
while<00:03:32.220> lower<00:03:32.430> hips<00:03:32.730> is<00:03:32.940> flexing<00:03:33.720> my<00:03:33.840> hips

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
while lower hips is flexing my hips

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.559 
while lower hips is flexing my hips
forwards<00:03:34.760> basically<00:03:35.760> closing<00:03:36.030> the<00:03:36.300> angle

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
forwards basically closing the angle

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.140 
forwards basically closing the angle
between<00:03:36.690> my<00:03:37.020> hips<00:03:37.350> and<00:03:37.890> my<00:03:38.160> shoulders<00:03:38.190> it's

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
between my hips and my shoulders it's

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.630 
between my hips and my shoulders it's
the<00:03:39.390> reverse<00:03:39.810> of<00:03:40.080> a<00:03:40.260> normal<00:03:40.650> crunch<00:03:40.980> you<00:03:41.490> like

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
the reverse of a normal crunch you like

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.130 
the reverse of a normal crunch you like
where<00:03:41.910> you<00:03:41.940> bring<00:03:42.209> your<00:03:42.270> shoulders

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
where you bring your shoulders

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.400 
where you bring your shoulders
closer<00:03:44.180> towards<00:03:45.180> your<00:03:45.330> hips<00:03:45.540> you're<00:03:46.110> closing

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
closer towards your hips you're closing

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.590 
closer towards your hips you're closing
the<00:03:46.590> angle<00:03:47.040> it's<00:03:47.580> the<00:03:47.790> opposite<00:03:48.150> movement<00:03:48.360> I

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
the angle it's the opposite movement I

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.930 
the angle it's the opposite movement I
want<00:03:48.780> to<00:03:48.840> do<00:03:48.930> my<00:03:49.080> hips<00:03:49.350> up<00:03:49.770> as<00:03:50.220> if<00:03:50.580> I'm

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
want to do my hips up as if I'm

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.090 
want to do my hips up as if I'm
following<00:03:51.239> in<00:03:51.480> an<00:03:51.570> arc<00:03:51.810> with<00:03:52.500> my<00:03:52.680> shoulders

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
following in an arc with my shoulders

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.070 
following in an arc with my shoulders
and<00:03:53.640> I'm<00:03:53.790> not<00:03:53.940> swinging<00:03:54.300> my<00:03:54.569> legs<00:03:54.780> back<00:03:55.050> and

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
and I'm not swinging my legs back and

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.740 
and I'm not swinging my legs back and
forth<00:03:55.290> I'm<00:03:55.650> actually<00:03:55.830> engaging<00:03:56.489> my<00:03:57.270> rectus

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
forth I'm actually engaging my rectus

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.150 
forth I'm actually engaging my rectus
abdominus<00:03:58.350> here<00:03:58.590> to<00:03:59.220> act<00:03:59.580> like<00:03:59.940> I<00:04:00.470> put<00:04:01.470> it<00:04:01.590> to

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
abdominus here to act like I put it to

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.550 
abdominus here to act like I put it to
pull<00:04:02.550> my<00:04:02.730> hips<00:04:02.970> up<00:04:03.239> so<00:04:03.269> I<00:04:03.510> really<00:04:03.959> squeeze<00:04:04.350> my

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
pull my hips up so I really squeeze my

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.030 
pull my hips up so I really squeeze my
abs<00:04:04.769> as<00:04:05.070> I<00:04:06.030> bring<00:04:06.209> my<00:04:06.360> hip<00:04:06.540> towards<00:04:06.930> it's<00:04:07.170> that

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
abs as I bring my hip towards it's that

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.080 
abs as I bring my hip towards it's that
movement<00:04:08.370> there<00:04:08.760> so<00:04:09.540> get<00:04:10.290> used<00:04:10.500> to<00:04:10.620> that

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
movement there so get used to that

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.280 
movement there so get used to that
secondly<00:04:12.090> I'm<00:04:12.330> breaking<00:04:12.780> it<00:04:12.870> each<00:04:12.989> repetition

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
secondly I'm breaking it each repetition

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.890 
secondly I'm breaking it each repetition
down<00:04:13.830> there's<00:04:14.070> no<00:04:14.310> momentum<00:04:14.519> as<00:04:15.120> you<00:04:15.600> can<00:04:15.720> see

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
down there's no momentum as you can see

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.020 
down there's no momentum as you can see
I'm<00:04:16.109> stopping<00:04:16.680> and<00:04:16.919> forcing<00:04:17.430> water<00:04:17.640> at<00:04:17.880> the

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
I'm stopping and forcing water at the

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.569 
I'm stopping and forcing water at the
top<00:04:18.239> of<00:04:18.419> the<00:04:18.480> movement<00:04:18.720> and

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
top of the movement and

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.650 
top of the movement and
moving<00:04:21.180> out<00:04:21.419> as<00:04:21.720> I<00:04:21.840> grew<00:04:22.049> my<00:04:22.199> knees<00:04:22.379> up

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
moving out as I grew my knees up

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.779 
moving out as I grew my knees up
breathing<00:04:24.660> him<00:04:24.870> as<00:04:25.080> I<00:04:25.620> lower<00:04:25.860> my<00:04:26.069> knees<00:04:26.250> back

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:26.789 
breathing him as I lower my knees back

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:29.390 
breathing him as I lower my knees back
down<00:04:27.030> okay<00:04:27.990> let<00:04:28.289> me<00:04:28.379> show<00:04:28.409> you<00:04:28.650> the<00:04:28.830> variation

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
down okay let me show you the variation

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.700 
down okay let me show you the variation
of<00:04:29.430> that<00:04:29.639> which<00:04:29.819> is<00:04:30.000> straight<00:04:30.569> over<00:04:30.810> and<00:04:31.139> for

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
of that which is straight over and for

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:32.890 
of that which is straight over and for
this<00:04:31.830> one<00:04:32.069> you<00:04:32.099> can<00:04:32.370> keep<00:04:32.490> the<00:04:32.639> leg<00:04:32.819> straight

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
this one you can keep the leg straight

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.710 
this one you can keep the leg straight
it's<00:04:33.900> quite<00:04:34.169> a<00:04:34.199> bit<00:04:34.379> harder<00:04:34.560> so<00:04:35.129> maybe<00:04:35.940> 10<00:04:36.330> 15

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
it's quite a bit harder so maybe 10 15

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:45.690 
it's quite a bit harder so maybe 10 15
repetitions

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:45.700 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:05:09.950 

you

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.490 

that<00:05:10.560> involves<00:05:11.490> a<00:05:11.639> lot<00:05:11.850> more<00:05:12.030> work<00:05:12.270> so<00:05:12.660> I'd

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
that involves a lot more work so I'd

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.670 
that involves a lot more work so I'd
actually<00:05:13.650> recommend<00:05:14.009> you<00:05:14.639> use<00:05:15.090> the<00:05:15.419> arm<00:05:16.080> rests

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
actually recommend you use the arm rests

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.760 
actually recommend you use the arm rests
and<00:05:16.889> aim<00:05:17.820> for<00:05:18.120> higher<00:05:18.389> repetitions<00:05:18.770> better

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
and aim for higher repetitions better

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.909 
and aim for higher repetitions better
quality<00:05:20.370> and<00:05:20.610> engage<00:05:21.330> more<00:05:21.870> of<00:05:21.930> the<00:05:22.289> abdominal

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 
quality and engage more of the abdominal

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:25.249 
quality and engage more of the abdominal
muscles<00:05:23.340> as<00:05:23.820> opposed<00:05:24.330> to<00:05:24.449> swing<00:05:24.810> your<00:05:25.050> legs
