00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.130
 hello everybody it's really for 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.810
 the test string of all kinds and 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.790
 today at this new video I 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.240
 will show you how we are going 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.500
 optimize its battery percentage 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.630
 as you see if I still have 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.109
 many even of the case I come from the 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.380
 recharge 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:22.590
 but when it level s + 10% or even 20% 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.560
 and you still want to use it 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.390
 so me it can not go so I use 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.699
 not with the network puts for example here 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:34.290
 with the wifi it'll be it's going to be me 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:37.260
 helpful saw them show how so there the 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.410
 tweak cydia is called severe bat he is 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.520
 available on two sources so xliv and 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:50.460
 big boss or click install 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:53.579
 confirmed on the right it is expected that the 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:01:02.910
 loading bar ends so the 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:03.650
 spa near this relatively fast is 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.850
 normally 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.210
 here it is put a little time at 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.210
 beginning 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.260
 so it lasts in less than a minute 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.760
 in the end you will have your application at 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:24.560
 made in us you see that it's going 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.560
 relatively fast towards the end 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.720
 reloading data and we're going 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.110
 click on relaunched the springboard 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.350
 continue but here we wait 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.860
 it just lasts about 10 seconds 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:42.600
 we just have to wait for them 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.170
 install the application so on our 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.170
 apparatus 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.570
 so here you have now your 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.270
 application that is on your 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.750
 springboard here when we open it there 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.390
 will propose us 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:11.320
 the used that we have so me is 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:14.210
 Normally you will be marked normal 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:20.540
 so is normal so it's exactly 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:24.590
 same as before here you have normal 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.840
 more data activation assets 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.550
 so the network me it goes against 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.430
 disable reason but rather the wifi 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:34.670
 so you 're gonna disable you the 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.490
 network the wifi so all shipments of 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.500
 data that are who are being 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:42.230
 when you lock your device 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.060
 here ultimate so that's when you 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.790
 really have a lot of batteries 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.410
 savate or disable when you when 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.470
 you lock your device and a 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.240
 custom you will be able to choose what 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.700
 you actually want to disable 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.560
 for example the wifi you do what 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.989
 so you want me there I put it in 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:05.290
 aggressive mode you see here as in 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:07.580
 wifi is activated I turn it off so here 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.820
 when your device turns it off 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.890
 polo relight right after so I 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:17.870
 will do a simulation and consult it 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:24.680
 unlocks see here the wifi is not 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:26.150
 more active and so when you see who 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.030
 turned on when you unlock 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.550
 in fact he is going to reignite so here is 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.989
 this app is downloading on the 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:34.989
 source of xls and
