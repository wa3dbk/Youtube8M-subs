 this early hour in the morning 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.610
 while some of you are 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.780

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:15.629
 every time this woman comes to 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:17.540

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:20.280
 good morning Good Morning 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:22.830
 but good but good and we heat already 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.900
 warm up I bring you a very exercise 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.510
 interesting good let's work the 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.150
 arms and I like that because I feel 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.620
 then of course we're going to hammer 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.530
 let's go to the part in front of your arm 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:38.579
 what are the dances ok are we going to use a 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:41.550
 species is I recommend between 5 to 6 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.199
 and if they are more advanced 8 pounds well 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.030
 easy right back sitting to the 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:47.159
 edge of a chair if we are going to do 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.829
 hammers you are going to raise bend your elbows 

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:52.350
 the elbows always next to the waist 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.409
 and it only leads to observe their 10 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.839
 repeats now with the weights here at 

00:00:55.409 --> 00:01:01.229
 side of your hips opens the 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:03.239
 legs and use in the right hand the 

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:06.150
 You put the elbow inside of your 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.590
 leg and you do another set you up 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.020
 you take it to the jaw 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.850
 but this weighs almost nothing and this is not 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.250
 it weighs almost nothing but then later if you use it 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.090
 with 58 weights is doing many 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.159
 repetitions 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.759
 it's going to hurt more now that you change the 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.149
 another arm the next only is times is 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:27.030
 to strengthen the encores twice and 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:29.819
 then unfinished and you rest for 30 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.619
 seconds and do it again from 

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:34.200
 marcelo and repeat that of the mark what 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.200
 it's next thing next to the waist here 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.939
 doubled and up and then instead of starting 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.899
 with your right hand you're going to start with 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.360
 the left hand 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.970
 we start here and again 10 repetitions 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.610
 10 repetitions that's going to make two 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.489
 Sometimes it is important for a woman to have 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.310
 well defined muscles Bezel 

00:01:50.489 --> 00:01:55.379
 it is important to have the arm 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.610
 totally and today we are working the 

00:01:55.379 --> 00:01:58.860
 part in front but then it will bring you 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.049
 the back apart you do not have a 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.179
 balance in the arms in the body has 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.789

 fear in the weights because they are not going to 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.680
 put large you can show your fish
