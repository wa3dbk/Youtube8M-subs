leads it's a two pin removable connector

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.190 
leads it's a two pin removable connector
here<00:03:36.160> and<00:03:36.450> what<00:03:37.450> you<00:03:37.569> want<00:03:37.600> to<00:03:37.810> do<00:03:37.930> is<00:03:38.049> I've

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
here and what you want to do is I've

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.830 
here and what you want to do is I've
already<00:03:38.380> done<00:03:38.650> it<00:03:38.829> is<00:03:38.980> just<00:03:39.370> cut<00:03:39.730> the<00:03:40.150> leads<00:03:40.450> on

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
already done it is just cut the leads on

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.949 
already done it is just cut the leads on
both<00:03:41.319> ends<00:03:41.680> to<00:03:41.769> that<00:03:41.950> connector<00:03:42.660> this<00:03:43.660> is

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
both ends to that connector this is

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:45.840 
both ends to that connector this is
where<00:03:44.290> the<00:03:44.440> problem<00:03:44.829> lies<00:03:44.859> in<00:03:45.310> these<00:03:45.519> sets

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
where the problem lies in these sets

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.080 
where the problem lies in these sets
it's<00:03:46.660> the<00:03:46.870> contacts<00:03:47.380> in<00:03:47.590> that<00:03:47.739> connector<00:03:48.220> get

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
it's the contacts in that connector get

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.080 
it's the contacts in that connector get
oxidized<00:03:49.750> and<00:03:50.230> they<00:03:50.889> don't<00:03:51.489> make<00:03:51.639> connection

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
oxidized and they don't make connection

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.670 
oxidized and they don't make connection
anymore<00:03:52.359> and<00:03:52.690> so<00:03:52.810> that's<00:03:53.019> why<00:03:53.230> you<00:03:53.290> get<00:03:53.530> the

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
anymore and so that's why you get the

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.699 
anymore and so that's why you get the
air<00:03:53.799> flow<00:03:54.040> message<00:03:54.430> on<00:03:54.609> the<00:03:54.760> screen

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
air flow message on the screen

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:58.379 
air flow message on the screen
so<00:03:56.709> once<00:03:57.160> you've<00:03:57.310> cut<00:03:57.549> the<00:03:57.700> leads<00:03:57.940> what<00:03:58.239> you

00:03:58.379 --> 00:03:58.389 
so once you've cut the leads what you

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:01.740 
so once you've cut the leads what you
want<00:03:58.599> to<00:03:58.720> do<00:03:58.840> is<00:03:59.910> so<00:04:00.910> what<00:04:01.090> I've<00:04:01.209> done<00:04:01.389> is<00:04:01.569> I've

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
want to do is so what I've done is I've

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.839 
want to do is so what I've done is I've
stripped<00:04:02.260> I've<00:04:02.980> cut<00:04:03.250> the<00:04:03.370> wires<00:04:03.549> that

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:03.849 
stripped I've cut the wires that

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:05.370 
stripped I've cut the wires that
stripped<00:04:04.180> them<00:04:04.329> back<00:04:04.510> and<00:04:04.720> I've<00:04:04.810> tinned<00:04:05.170> them

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
stripped them back and I've tinned them

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.949 
stripped them back and I've tinned them
with<00:04:05.560> solder<00:04:05.829> and<00:04:06.579> what<00:04:07.180> I'm<00:04:07.269> going<00:04:07.450> to<00:04:07.540> do<00:04:07.720> is

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
with solder and what I'm going to do is

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:12.059 
with solder and what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:04:08.109> going<00:04:08.319> to<00:04:08.440> add<00:04:08.709> a<00:04:10.349> short<00:04:11.349> piece<00:04:11.620> of<00:04:11.859> wire

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:12.069 
I'm going to add a short piece of wire

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:13.740 
I'm going to add a short piece of wire
I'm<00:04:12.310> going<00:04:12.519> to<00:04:12.609> strip<00:04:12.849> each<00:04:13.090> end<00:04:13.329> of<00:04:13.450> it<00:04:13.540> back

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
I'm going to strip each end of it back

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.479 
I'm going to strip each end of it back
I'm<00:04:13.959> going<00:04:14.109> to<00:04:14.200> tin<00:04:14.470> it<00:04:14.620> and<00:04:14.980> I'm<00:04:15.099> going<00:04:15.280> to<00:04:15.310> add

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
I'm going to tin it and I'm going to add

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:19.090 
I'm going to tin it and I'm going to add
it<00:04:15.730> to<00:04:15.930> it

00:05:56.669 --> 00:05:56.679 
the new pieces give it a blast of warm

00:05:56.679 --> 00:06:09.520 
the new pieces give it a blast of warm
air<00:05:56.949> to<00:05:57.249> shrink<00:05:57.699> them<00:05:57.879> down

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:09.530 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.050 

like<00:06:10.530> to<00:06:10.680> kind<00:06:10.860> of<00:06:10.919> tech<00:06:11.160> them<00:06:11.340> away<00:06:11.580> over<00:06:11.880> here

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:12.060 
like to kind of tech them away over here

like to kind of tech them away over here
so<00:06:12.300> there<00:06:12.449> they're<00:06:13.229> out<00:06:13.260> of<00:06:13.440> the<00:06:13.680> way<00:06:13.710> because

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:14.130 
so there they're out of the way because

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:17.570 
so there they're out of the way because
the<00:06:14.280> fan<00:06:14.580> assembly<00:06:15.510> sits<00:06:16.050> right<00:06:16.949> up<00:06:17.160> in<00:06:17.340> here

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580 
the fan assembly sits right up in here

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:20.689 
the fan assembly sits right up in here
as<00:06:17.699> well<00:06:18.470> so<00:06:19.470> that<00:06:19.710> part's<00:06:20.070> done<00:06:20.280> now<00:06:20.490> we'll<00:06:20.610> go

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:20.699 
as well so that part's done now we'll go

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:25.189 
as well so that part's done now we'll go
ahead<00:06:20.820> and<00:06:20.940> put<00:06:21.150> it<00:06:21.240> back<00:06:21.389> in<00:06:21.600> the<00:06:21.720> set<00:06:24.139> it's<00:06:25.139> a

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:25.199 
ahead and put it back in the set it's a

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:26.840 
ahead and put it back in the set it's a
good<00:06:25.350> idea<00:06:25.470> just<00:06:25.710> to<00:06:25.979> take<00:06:26.190> and<00:06:26.370> wipe<00:06:26.610> off<00:06:26.820> the

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:26.850
