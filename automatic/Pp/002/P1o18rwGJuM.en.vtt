00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.580 
for my flight back to Melbourne

apparently my wallet was burning a hole
in<00:00:26.650> my<00:00:26.769> pocket<00:00:27.070> or<00:00:27.640> my<00:00:28.080> backpack<00:00:29.080> probably<00:00:29.590> at

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:29.710 
in my pocket or my backpack probably at

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.609 
in my pocket or my backpack probably at
that<00:00:29.769> point<00:00:29.859> I<00:00:30.279> ended<00:00:31.240> up<00:00:31.439> splurging<00:00:32.439> and

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:32.619 
that point I ended up splurging and

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.290 
that point I ended up splurging and
buying<00:00:32.830> a<00:00:33.100> whole<00:00:33.280> bunch<00:00:33.490> of<00:00:33.670> perfumes<00:00:34.120> I'd

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.300 
buying a whole bunch of perfumes I'd

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.760 
buying a whole bunch of perfumes I'd
been<00:00:34.480> thinking<00:00:34.810> about<00:00:34.900> buying<00:00:35.230> for<00:00:35.500> quite<00:00:35.740> a

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:35.770 
been thinking about buying for quite a

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.550 
been thinking about buying for quite a
while<00:00:36.010> so<00:00:36.490> it<00:00:36.610> wasn't<00:00:37.000> really<00:00:37.270> I<00:00:37.480> suppose<00:00:38.230> it

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:38.560 
while so it wasn't really I suppose it

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.799 
while so it wasn't really I suppose it
wasn't<00:00:38.740> spur-of-the-moment<00:00:39.610> it<00:00:40.390> was<00:00:40.570> more

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:40.809 
wasn't spur-of-the-moment it was more

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:42.150 
wasn't spur-of-the-moment it was more
that<00:00:40.840> they<00:00:41.260> were<00:00:41.379> very<00:00:41.590> cheap<00:00:41.860> in<00:00:42.129> comparison

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.160 
that they were very cheap in comparison

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.830 
that they were very cheap in comparison
to<00:00:42.760> what<00:00:42.940> they<00:00:43.059> do<00:00:43.239> when<00:00:43.420> I<00:00:43.480> got<00:00:43.629> back<00:00:43.809> to

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 
to what they do when I got back to

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.500 
to what they do when I got back to
Australia<00:00:44.559> and<00:00:44.710> I've<00:00:45.670> been<00:00:46.030> thinking<00:00:46.270> about

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
Australia and I've been thinking about

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.319 
Australia and I've been thinking about
them<00:00:46.719> for<00:00:46.899> a<00:00:46.930> long<00:00:47.079> time<00:00:47.289> so<00:00:47.860> there's<00:00:48.760> four<00:00:49.300> of

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 
them for a long time so there's four of

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:51.840 
them for a long time so there's four of
them<00:00:49.660> and<00:00:49.840> I<00:00:50.379> got<00:00:50.410> all<00:00:50.800> four<00:00:51.039> of<00:00:51.070> them<00:00:51.370> and<00:00:51.520> also

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
them and I got all four of them and also

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.810 
them and I got all four of them and also
a<00:00:52.059> palette<00:00:52.570> from<00:00:52.719> Bobby<00:00:52.989> Brown<00:00:53.170> for<00:00:53.680> just<00:00:54.579> over

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
a palette from Bobby Brown for just over

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.060 
a palette from Bobby Brown for just over
300<00:00:55.390> Australian<00:00:56.020> dollars<00:00:56.289> which<00:00:56.469> is<00:00:56.710> pretty

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
300 Australian dollars which is pretty

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.799 
300 Australian dollars which is pretty
good<00:00:57.309> considering<00:00:58.120> it<00:00:58.390> probably<00:00:58.660> would

00:00:58.799 --> 00:00:58.809 
good considering it probably would

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:01.229 
good considering it probably would
normally<00:00:59.109> pay<00:00:59.350> at<00:00:59.769> least<00:00:59.980> $100<00:01:00.730> for<00:01:00.910> each<00:01:01.030> of

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
normally pay at least $100 for each of

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:03.660 
normally pay at least $100 for each of
the<00:01:01.300> perfumes<00:01:01.809> so<00:01:01.960> that's<00:01:02.430> $100<00:01:03.430> saved

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
the perfumes so that's $100 saved

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.120 
the perfumes so that's $100 saved
already<00:01:03.879> not<00:01:04.269> including<00:01:04.720> the<00:01:04.840> palette<00:01:05.199> anyway

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
already not including the palette anyway

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.430 
already not including the palette anyway
I<00:01:06.160> sort<00:01:07.150> of<00:01:07.210> sound<00:01:07.450> like<00:01:07.510> I'm<00:01:07.720> justifying<00:01:08.230> it

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440

like<00:01:53.920> at<00:01:54.070> least<00:01:54.189> $200<00:01:55.030> so<00:01:55.659> I<00:01:56.049> hadn't<00:01:56.500> bought<00:01:56.619> it

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
like at least $200 so I hadn't bought it

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.080 
like at least $200 so I hadn't bought it
for<00:01:57.820> I<00:01:58.380> hadn't<00:01:59.380> bought<00:01:59.500> it<00:01:59.680> until<00:02:00.040> now

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
for I hadn't bought it until now

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.929 
for I hadn't bought it until now
so<00:02:01.479> I<00:02:01.509> finally<00:02:01.869> the<00:02:02.290> bullet<00:02:02.680> and<00:02:02.860> it<00:02:03.399> is

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 
so I finally the bullet and it is

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:09.749 
so I finally the bullet and it is
Chanel's<00:02:04.360> chance<00:02:06.869> I<00:02:08.100> ended<00:02:09.100> up<00:02:09.160> buying<00:02:09.399> it<00:02:09.580> in

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
Chanel's chance I ended up buying it in

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.170 
Chanel's chance I ended up buying it in
the<00:02:09.910> twist<00:02:10.210> and<00:02:10.420> spray<00:02:11.670> bottle<00:02:12.670> I<00:02:12.880> guess<00:02:13.030> you

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
the twist and spray bottle I guess you

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.780 
the twist and spray bottle I guess you
call<00:02:13.330> it<00:02:13.510> so<00:02:13.720> you<00:02:13.780> basically<00:02:14.050> just<00:02:14.610> twist<00:02:15.610> it

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
call it so you basically just twist it

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.850 
call it so you basically just twist it
and<00:02:15.970> then<00:02:16.120> up<00:02:16.300> comes<00:02:16.540> a<00:02:16.780> little<00:02:16.990> spray<00:02:17.380> nozzle

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
and then up comes a little spray nozzle

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:18.960 
and then up comes a little spray nozzle
thingy

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
thingy

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.940 
thingy
and<00:02:19.180> it<00:02:19.330> also<00:02:19.480> comes<00:02:19.840> with

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
and it also comes with

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.460 
and it also comes with
two<00:02:21.040> extra<00:02:21.430> refills<00:02:21.730> in<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.660> packet<00:02:23.050> I<00:02:23.140> think

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
two extra refills in the packet I think

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.100 
two extra refills in the packet I think
I'm<00:02:23.920> hoping<00:02:24.310> hasn't<00:02:24.940> checked<00:02:25.120> but<00:02:25.450> yes<00:02:25.810> there

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
I'm hoping hasn't checked but yes there

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.910 
I'm hoping hasn't checked but yes there
they<00:02:26.230> are<00:02:26.349> so<00:02:26.590> that's<00:02:27.400> the<00:02:27.819> size<00:02:28.060> of<00:02:28.920> each

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
they are so that's the size of each

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.920 
they are so that's the size of each
bottle<00:02:31.050> 20<00:02:32.050> mils<00:02:32.230> each<00:02:32.410> so<00:02:32.739> 60<00:02:33.280> mils<00:02:33.459> all<00:02:33.879> up<00:02:34.599> I

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
bottle 20 mils each so 60 mils all up I

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.890 
bottle 20 mils each so 60 mils all up I
think<00:02:35.319> I<00:02:35.470> got<00:02:36.069> yep<00:02:36.879> so<00:02:37.090> this<00:02:37.300> is<00:02:37.480> the<00:02:37.630> Eau<00:02:37.660> de

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
think I got yep so this is the Eau de

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.670 
think I got yep so this is the Eau de
Toilette<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:40.000> actual<00:02:40.390> perfume<00:02:40.810> version<00:02:41.530> is

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
Toilette the actual perfume version is

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.220 
Toilette the actual perfume version is
more<00:02:42.010> expensive<00:02:42.310> and<00:02:42.810> even<00:02:43.810> when<00:02:43.959> I<00:02:43.989> was<00:02:44.170> on

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
more expensive and even when I was on

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.130 
more expensive and even when I was on
duty-free<00:02:45.360> right<00:02:46.360> it<00:02:46.599> was<00:02:46.720> still<00:02:46.930> quite

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
duty-free right it was still quite

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.640 
duty-free right it was still quite
expensive<00:02:47.230> so<00:02:47.769> I<00:02:48.340> also<00:02:49.060> found<00:02:49.569> that<00:02:49.930> the

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
expensive so I also found that the

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.670 
expensive so I also found that the
twilit<00:02:51.099> only<00:02:51.700> came<00:02:51.910> in<00:02:52.060> this<00:02:52.230> spray<00:02:53.230> version

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
twilit only came in this spray version

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.920 
twilit only came in this spray version
which<00:02:53.830> is<00:02:53.980> a<00:02:54.010> lot<00:02:54.190> easier<00:02:54.580> to<00:02:54.700> carry<00:02:54.910> around<00:02:55.030> to

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
which is a lot easier to carry around to

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.030 
which is a lot easier to carry around to
be<00:02:56.019> honest<00:02:56.290> there<00:02:56.620> wasn't<00:02:56.890> that<00:02:56.920> much

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
be honest there wasn't that much

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.339 
be honest there wasn't that much
difference<00:02:57.519> to<00:02:57.910> me<00:02:58.060> in<00:02:58.330> the<00:02:58.599> sense<00:02:58.840> between

00:02:59.339 --> 00:02:59.349 
difference to me in the sense between

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:01.470 
difference to me in the sense between
the<00:02:59.470> two<00:02:59.620> so<00:03:00.250> I<00:03:00.280> went<00:03:00.670> for<00:03:00.790> the<00:03:00.849> cheaper<00:03:01.299> and

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
the two so I went for the cheaper and

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.199 
the two so I went for the cheaper and
the<00:03:02.019> easier<00:03:02.470> more<00:03:02.829> compact<00:03:03.280> version<00:03:03.400> I'm

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
the easier more compact version I'm

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.690 
the easier more compact version I'm
really<00:03:04.660> really<00:03:04.810> bad<00:03:05.079> at<00:03:05.380> describing<00:03:05.980> scents

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
really really bad at describing scents

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.300 
really really bad at describing scents
so<00:03:07.180> I<00:03:07.510> don't<00:03:07.690> even<00:03:08.349> know<00:03:08.620> if<00:03:08.650> I<00:03:08.860> want<00:03:09.040> to<00:03:09.069> try

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
so I don't even know if I want to try

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.030 
so I don't even know if I want to try
describing<00:03:09.790> what<00:03:10.329> Chanel<00:03:11.200> chant<00:03:11.530> smells<00:03:11.829> like

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
describing what Chanel chant smells like

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.550 
describing what Chanel chant smells like
I<00:03:14.250> don't<00:03:15.250> I<00:03:15.489> don't<00:03:15.549> even<00:03:15.849> recognize<00:03:16.720> what<00:03:17.110> it

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
I don't I don't even recognize what it

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.550 
I don't I don't even recognize what it
smells<00:03:17.829> like<00:03:17.950> but<00:03:18.099> once<00:03:18.489> again<00:03:18.700> it's<00:03:19.030> also

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
smells like but once again it's also

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.550 
smells like but once again it's also
quite<00:03:20.560> floral<00:03:21.069> and<00:03:21.310> it's<00:03:21.970> it's<00:03:22.900> more<00:03:23.170> sweet

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
quite floral and it's it's more sweet

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.349 
quite floral and it's it's more sweet
sweeter<00:03:24.519> than<00:03:24.730> I<00:03:24.880> I<00:03:25.060> guess<00:03:26.069> Daisy<00:03:27.069> is<00:03:27.459> but<00:03:28.180> also

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:28.359 
sweeter than I I guess Daisy is but also

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:30.660 
sweeter than I I guess Daisy is but also
very<00:03:28.870> inoffensive<00:03:29.290> and<00:03:29.650> I<00:03:29.739> find<00:03:29.980> that<00:03:30.130> this<00:03:30.459> is

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
very inoffensive and I find that this is

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.129 
very inoffensive and I find that this is
also<00:03:30.910> something<00:03:31.329> that<00:03:31.540> you<00:03:31.690> could<00:03:31.930> probably

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:32.139 
also something that you could probably

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:36.000 
also something that you could probably
buy<00:03:32.620> almost<00:03:33.130> anybody<00:03:33.609> as<00:03:33.760> present<00:03:34.329> and<00:03:35.290> they'd

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
buy almost anybody as present and they'd

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.620 
buy almost anybody as present and they'd
like<00:03:36.250> the<00:03:36.430> scent<00:03:36.670> because<00:03:36.970> it's<00:03:37.180> just<00:03:37.420> a

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
like the scent because it's just a

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.360 
like the scent because it's just a
really<00:03:38.109> easy<00:03:39.180> to<00:03:40.180> like<00:03:40.709> since<00:03:41.709> if<00:03:42.040> that<00:03:42.190> makes

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
really easy to like since if that makes

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.330 
really easy to like since if that makes
sense<00:03:42.630> actually<00:03:43.630> these<00:03:43.989> last<00:03:44.290> year<00:03:44.560> I<00:03:44.920> think<00:03:45.250> I

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
sense actually these last year I think I

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.770 
sense actually these last year I think I
was<00:03:45.489> lying<00:03:45.700> a<00:03:45.850> little<00:03:45.970> bit<00:03:46.180> I<00:03:46.209> haven't<00:03:46.600> been

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780

think<00:04:05.859> when<00:04:06.010> I<00:04:06.130> was<00:04:06.160> obviously<00:04:07.060> in<00:04:07.150> London

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
think when I was obviously in London

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
think when I was obviously in London
everything's<00:04:09.130> very<00:04:09.280> expensive<00:04:09.730> at<00:04:09.819> Harrods

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
everything's very expensive at Harrods

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.490 
everything's very expensive at Harrods
so<00:04:10.269> I<00:04:10.299> wasn't<00:04:10.540> gonna<00:04:10.630> buy<00:04:10.810> it<00:04:10.870> there<00:04:11.109> but<00:04:11.380> when

so I wasn't gonna buy it there but when

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.890

I<00:04:11.530> saw<00:04:11.829> it<00:04:11.859> at<00:04:12.190> Judy<00:04:12.549> free<00:04:12.760> for<00:04:13.000> quite<00:04:13.450> a<00:04:13.660> bit

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
I saw it at Judy free for quite a bit

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.379 
I saw it at Judy free for quite a bit
cheaper<00:04:13.930> still<00:04:14.680> not<00:04:14.829> cheap<00:04:15.489> but<00:04:15.819> quite<00:04:16.209> a<00:04:16.239> bit

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:16.389 
cheaper still not cheap but quite a bit

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:18.449 
cheaper still not cheap but quite a bit
cheaper<00:04:16.780> I<00:04:16.810> ended<00:04:17.169> up<00:04:17.260> buying<00:04:17.500> it<00:04:17.769> I<00:04:17.979> actually

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
cheaper I ended up buying it I actually

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.370 
cheaper I ended up buying it I actually
haven't<00:04:19.090> used<00:04:19.239> it<00:04:19.479> at<00:04:19.599> all<00:04:19.720> since<00:04:19.930> I've<00:04:20.139> been

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
haven't used it at all since I've been

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.920 
haven't used it at all since I've been
back<00:04:20.799> in<00:04:21.010> Australia<00:04:21.250> because<00:04:21.609> it's<00:04:22.000> to<00:04:22.780> me

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
back in Australia because it's to me

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.290 
back in Australia because it's to me
it's<00:04:23.229> either<00:04:23.500> a<00:04:23.800> nighttime<00:04:24.070> or<00:04:24.610> a<00:04:24.970> winter

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
it's either a nighttime or a winter

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.120 
it's either a nighttime or a winter
fragrance<00:04:25.750> so<00:04:25.960> we<00:04:26.440> weren't<00:04:26.620> getting<00:04:26.710> much<00:04:26.860> use

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
fragrance so we weren't getting much use

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.420 
fragrance so we weren't getting much use
out<00:04:27.250> of<00:04:27.310> this<00:04:27.490> until<00:04:28.140> I<00:04:29.140> start<00:04:30.039> going<00:04:30.190> out<00:04:30.400> more

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
out of this until I start going out more

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.740 
out of this until I start going out more
or<00:04:30.849> into<00:04:31.539> winter<00:04:32.280> it's<00:04:33.280> a<00:04:33.460> really<00:04:33.760> deep<00:04:33.940> musky

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
or into winter it's a really deep musky

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.470 
or into winter it's a really deep musky
very<00:04:35.790> sensual<00:04:36.790> I<00:04:37.090> guess<00:04:37.330> you'd<00:04:37.510> call<00:04:37.540> it<00:04:37.750> since

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:39.480 
very sensual I guess you'd call it since

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.630 
very sensual I guess you'd call it since
but<00:04:40.480> once<00:04:40.630> again<00:04:40.810> don't<00:04:41.770> ask<00:04:41.980> me<00:04:42.160> to<00:04:42.190> describe

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
but once again don't ask me to describe

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.130 
but once again don't ask me to describe
exactly<00:04:42.790> what<00:04:43.150> it<00:04:43.360> smells<00:04:43.630> like<00:04:43.750> but<00:04:43.870> that's

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:44.140 
exactly what it smells like but that's

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.980 
exactly what it smells like but that's
what<00:04:44.680> it<00:04:44.800> feels<00:04:44.920> to<00:04:45.130> me<00:04:45.340> in<00:04:46.330> the<00:04:46.420> last<00:04:46.630> one<00:04:46.900> that

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
what it feels to me in the last one that

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.390 
what it feels to me in the last one that
I<00:04:47.080> bought<00:04:47.350> it's<00:04:47.740> actually<00:04:48.070> a<00:04:48.100> little<00:04:48.280> bit

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
I bought it's actually a little bit

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.970 
I bought it's actually a little bit
different<00:04:48.730> because<00:04:48.960> it<00:04:49.960> came<00:04:50.230> in<00:04:50.410> a<00:04:50.470> pack<00:04:50.710> with

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:50.980 
different because it came in a pack with

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.900 
different because it came in a pack with
four<00:04:51.340> smaller<00:04:52.300> sizes<00:04:52.890> small<00:04:53.910> smaller

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
four smaller sizes small smaller

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.590 
four smaller sizes small smaller
versions<00:04:55.420> of<00:04:55.660> the<00:04:56.020> perfume<00:04:56.920> so<00:04:57.820> I<00:04:57.850> decided<00:04:58.360> I'd

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 
versions of the perfume so I decided I'd

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.220 
versions of the perfume so I decided I'd
get<00:04:58.810> that<00:04:59.020> because<00:04:59.440> I<00:04:59.920> I<00:05:00.730> don't<00:05:01.120> really<00:05:01.870> go

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:02.230 
get that because I I don't really go

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:04.100 
get that because I I don't really go
good<00:05:02.440> through<00:05:02.860> a<00:05:02.890> whole<00:05:03.130> bottle<00:05:03.340> of<00:05:03.520> perfume

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
good through a whole bottle of perfume

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.180 
good through a whole bottle of perfume
certainly<00:05:05.110> not<00:05:05.290> for<00:05:05.440> a<00:05:05.500> couple<00:05:05.740> of<00:05:05.830> years<00:05:06.040> at

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
certainly not for a couple of years at

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.190 
certainly not for a couple of years at
least<00:05:06.220> and<00:05:06.610> I<00:05:07.180> thought<00:05:07.390> seeing<00:05:07.840> this<00:05:07.990> is

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:08.200 
least and I thought seeing this is

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.770 
least and I thought seeing this is
actually<00:05:08.560> a<00:05:08.590> very<00:05:08.860> I<00:05:09.490> guess<00:05:09.880> a<00:05:10.180> universal

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
actually a very I guess a universal

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.230 
actually a very I guess a universal
scent<00:05:11.080> for<00:05:11.350> females<00:05:11.860> I<00:05:12.280> thought<00:05:12.850> it<00:05:13.000> would<00:05:13.120> be

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
scent for females I thought it would be

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.720 
scent for females I thought it would be
good<00:05:13.420> to<00:05:13.600> give<00:05:13.900> people<00:05:14.200> as<00:05:14.730> Christmas

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:15.730 
good to give people as Christmas

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:03.190 
teens so obviously just saying that

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.520 
teens so obviously just saying that
shows<00:06:03.610> that<00:06:03.850> it's<00:06:04.030> quite<00:06:04.210> I<00:06:04.390> obviously<00:06:05.140> think

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:05.530 
shows that it's quite I obviously think

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:09.480 
shows that it's quite I obviously think
it's<00:06:05.650> quite<00:06:05.860> universal<00:06:06.690> it's<00:06:08.400> it's<00:06:09.400> very

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:09.490 
it's quite universal it's it's very

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.320 
it's quite universal it's it's very
sweet<00:06:09.970> but<00:06:10.120> it's<00:06:10.270> not<00:06:10.360> sickly<00:06:10.810> sweet<00:06:10.930> and<00:06:12.330> once

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:13.330 
sweet but it's not sickly sweet and once

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.440 
sweet but it's not sickly sweet and once
again<00:06:13.540> floral<00:06:14.940> obviously<00:06:15.940> that's<00:06:16.120> what<00:06:16.419> I

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:16.450 
again floral obviously that's what I

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:20.690 
again floral obviously that's what I
kind<00:06:16.840> of<00:06:16.960> like<00:06:17.169> but<00:06:17.770> I<00:06:18.570> think<00:06:19.570> it's<00:06:19.750> it's<00:06:20.229> not

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:20.700 
kind of like but I think it's it's not

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:23.790 
kind of like but I think it's it's not
too<00:06:21.700> young<00:06:22.030> but<00:06:22.330> it's<00:06:22.479> also<00:06:22.690> definitely<00:06:23.440> not

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:23.800 
too young but it's also definitely not

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.969 
too young but it's also definitely not
for<00:06:24.610> someone<00:06:25.030> too<00:06:25.479> old<00:06:25.900> I<00:06:26.260> guess<00:06:26.500> it<00:06:26.680> doesn't

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:26.979 
for someone too old I guess it doesn't

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:28.710 
for someone too old I guess it doesn't
have<00:06:27.160> that<00:06:27.190> dulled<00:06:27.640> sort<00:06:27.970> of<00:06:28.060> grandma's<00:06:28.419> smell

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:28.720 
have that dulled sort of grandma's smell

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.760 
have that dulled sort of grandma's smell
at<00:06:29.260> all<00:06:29.320> anyway<00:06:29.979> those<00:06:30.250> are<00:06:30.370> the<00:06:31.770> fragrances

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:32.770 
at all anyway those are the fragrances

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:34.590 
at all anyway those are the fragrances
that<00:06:33.010> I've<00:06:33.190> purchased<00:06:33.880> and<00:06:34.390> they've

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:34.600 
that I've purchased and they've

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.230 
that I've purchased and they've
certainly<00:06:35.320> built<00:06:35.890> up<00:06:36.070> my<00:06:36.250> collection<00:06:36.970> quite<00:06:37.120> a

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:37.240 
certainly built up my collection quite a

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.000 
certainly built up my collection quite a
bit<00:06:37.419> because<00:06:37.630> I<00:06:38.020> don't<00:06:38.410> have<00:06:38.710> that<00:06:38.860> many

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:39.010 
bit because I don't have that many

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:41.580 
bit because I don't have that many
perfumes<00:06:39.430> um<00:06:39.820> and<00:06:40.240> I<00:06:40.840> don't<00:06:40.900> think<00:06:41.320> I<00:06:41.410> should

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:41.590 
perfumes um and I don't think I should
