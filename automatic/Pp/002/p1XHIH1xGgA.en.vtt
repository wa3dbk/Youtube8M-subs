00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
transmission oil cooler like I said this

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.520 
transmission oil cooler like I said this
is<00:01:13.150> suitable<00:01:13.570> both<00:01:13.810> automatic<00:01:14.320> and<00:01:14.350> manual

is suitable both automatic and manual

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.410 
is suitable both automatic and manual
transmission<00:01:15.430> if<00:01:15.820> you<00:01:15.970> have<00:01:16.090> a<00:01:16.120> manual

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
transmission if you have a manual

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.660 
transmission if you have a manual
transmission<00:01:16.830> this<00:01:17.830> can<00:01:18.040> be<00:01:18.070> easily<00:01:18.310> removed

transmission this can be easily removed

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.670 
transmission this can be easily removed
and<00:01:19.150> they<00:01:19.360> just<00:01:19.540> remain<00:01:19.780> locked<00:01:20.020> up<00:01:20.230> unused

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
and they just remain locked up unused

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.380 
and they just remain locked up unused
and<00:01:21.100> that's<00:01:21.220> completely<00:01:21.610> safe<00:01:21.910> it's<00:01:22.210> not<00:01:22.330> a

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
and that's completely safe it's not a

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.120 
and that's completely safe it's not a
problem<00:01:22.570> at<00:01:22.810> all<00:01:22.870> so<00:01:23.410> this<00:01:23.560> is<00:01:23.590> suitable<00:01:24.070> for

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
problem at all so this is suitable for

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.540 
problem at all so this is suitable for
both<00:01:24.280> automatic<00:01:24.820> and<00:01:24.850> manual<00:01:25.030> transmissions

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
be an exact fit for the new radiator and

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.430 
be an exact fit for the new radiator and
it<00:02:23.150> could<00:02:23.269> also<00:02:23.390> have<00:02:23.660> rust<00:02:23.989> or<00:02:24.319> other

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
it could also have rust or other

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.869 
it could also have rust or other
contaminants<00:02:25.010> which<00:02:25.160> are<00:02:25.459> stopping<00:02:25.640> it<00:02:25.849> from

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:25.879 
contaminants which are stopping it from

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
with the new radiator and that way we

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.380 
with the new radiator and that way we
can<00:02:32.239> guarantee<00:02:32.420> it<00:02:33.200> will<00:02:33.319> be<00:02:33.500> an<00:02:33.620> exact<00:02:34.040> fit

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.699 

just<00:02:38.390> run<00:02:38.540> through<00:02:38.780> the<00:02:38.930> dimensions<00:02:39.410> of<00:02:39.560> the

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
just run through the dimensions of the

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.880 
just run through the dimensions of the
core<00:02:39.860> very<00:02:40.069> quickly<00:02:41.319> for<00:02:42.319> your<00:02:42.440> call<00:02:42.620> width

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
core very quickly for your call width

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:55.120 
core very quickly for your call width
from<00:02:43.879> inside<00:02:44.750> to<00:02:45.349> inside<00:02:53.530> so<00:02:54.530> you<00:02:54.560> have<00:02:54.799> a<00:02:54.829> call

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
from inside to inside so you have a call

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.250 
from inside to inside so you have a call
with<00:02:55.420> seven<00:02:56.420> hundred<00:02:56.690> and<00:02:56.780> twenty<00:02:57.079> five
