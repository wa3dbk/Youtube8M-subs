idea of a bullet brawl thursday is we're
going<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.290> play<00:01:34.470> between<00:01:35.340> two<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.090> three

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
going to play between two to three

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.030 
going to play between two to three
bullet<00:01:36.600> games<00:01:36.810> focus<00:01:37.259> more<00:01:37.560> on<00:01:37.590> the

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
bullet games focus more on the

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.969 
bullet games focus more on the
excitement<00:01:38.520> of<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.939> game<00:01:39.210> than<00:01:40.140> on<00:01:40.560> the

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
excitement of the game than on the

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.560 
excitement of the game than on the
analysis<00:01:41.640> afterwards<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.210> whether<00:01:42.329> it<00:01:42.450> was<00:01:42.540> a

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
analysis afterwards and whether it was a

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.719 
analysis afterwards and whether it was a
perfect<00:01:43.020> thing<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.740> perfection<00:01:44.310> of<00:01:44.399> it<00:01:44.549> is

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
perfect thing the perfection of it is

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.760 
perfect thing the perfection of it is
that<00:01:44.759> it's<00:01:44.970> flawed<00:01:45.390> anyway<00:01:45.689> so<00:01:46.170> now<00:01:46.470> we<00:01:46.530> have<00:01:46.740> a

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
that it's flawed anyway so now we have a

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.069 
that it's flawed anyway so now we have a
Smith<00:01:47.070> more<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.310> gambit<00:01:47.820> I'll<00:01:48.149> take<00:01:48.630> that<00:01:48.810> thing

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
Smith more a gambit I'll take that thing

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.719 
Smith more a gambit I'll take that thing
for<00:01:49.320> kicks<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.680> giggles<00:01:49.770> because<00:01:50.399> I<00:01:50.490> like

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
for kicks and giggles because I like

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.179 
for kicks and giggles because I like
pawns<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.680> now<00:01:52.680> I<00:01:52.710> have<00:01:52.890> my<00:01:52.979> own<00:01:53.009> little

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
pawns and now I have my own little

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.039 
pawns and now I have my own little
system<00:01:53.670> I<00:01:53.759> like<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.090> play<00:01:54.210> against<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.840> Smith

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
system I like to play against the Smith

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.440 
system I like to play against the Smith

Mora which is inherently risky it's a

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.440 
Mora which is inherently risky it's a
slow<00:01:57.869> developing<00:01:58.500> system<00:01:58.979> but<00:01:59.340> it<00:02:00.240> has<00:02:00.420> its

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
slow developing system but it has its
