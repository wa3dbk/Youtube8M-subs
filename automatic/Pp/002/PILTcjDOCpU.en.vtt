00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:06.030
 Hmm 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:12.120
 6 minutes 

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:13.540
 Ishigaki It looks like you see this package 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.930
 Quite 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:20.280
 It contains the color of warm color system 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:25.800
 I would like to reproduce it by dyeing it 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:26.940
 Basically it is this dessert euro to use to have and get it dyed Souk cormorants on this 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.840
 To go 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:32.360
 When the mix black brown a red brown and flat black in the here 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.880
 It becomes like this 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:41.090
 And if you mix clear orange with the color further , it will become dark brown like this 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:45.060
 It is the color of the shade of earth type 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:49.430
 When this comes to this lower one, is it 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.430
 Can be expressed heavily 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:11.010
 Let's do it with a lie like this 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:14.530
 The photos that came out of the package for sure are here 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:18.030
 It is a photo, and it is roughly half on 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:20.450
 We ride to the bright color I warm colors of 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.450
 It is a color 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.760
 It is such a thing 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:36.750
 If this is too thick, it will be buried as it is 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:40.490
 So dilute with this solvent 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.490
 Sense of dyeing 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:46.600
 If thin 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:49.890
 And Come in I is not possible or if you do not have enough 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.890
 It will be repainted 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.850
 Well, because it is an adult plamo road 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.429
 It is long at night in autumn 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:12.560
 At that time 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.560
 Yu 4 q will probably try this much 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.020
 I'm putting a lot of shade now also under this 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.290
 Te is superficial 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.740
 Around the church 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:39.030
 It is not blurred 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:41.510
 If you are above you 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.510
 gambling 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.330
 You supposed to be near the bottom is that interesting 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.650
 Black brown 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.650
 It is such a lower person of Ishigaki 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.510
 There and dye 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.510
 It has heavy sense of weight, etc. 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:33.580
 Just the first grave paint 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:37.980
 Chung Chung Chung and 6 o'clock also 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.980
 It can be changed to various colors 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.999
 After all this is Ishigaki dyeing 

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:31.999
 Finished
