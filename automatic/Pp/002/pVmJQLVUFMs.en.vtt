 using a reactor class 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.380
 i start i will create a box 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:42.740

 a and assistent 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:17.790
 air drag coefficient 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.790
 flow i put 1 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.500

 click create they are smaller 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:04:00.610

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.540
 for more smoothing
