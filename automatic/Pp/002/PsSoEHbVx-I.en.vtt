what you're gonna make every night you
know<00:03:45.830> and<00:03:46.570> stuff

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.930 

that<00:04:07.780> magical<00:04:08.349> moment<00:04:08.409> on<00:04:08.860> stage<00:04:08.940> where

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
that magical moment on stage where

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.000 
that magical moment on stage where
everything<00:04:10.540> is<00:04:10.659> just<00:04:10.690> kicking<00:04:11.080> when<00:04:11.680> you<00:04:11.799> can

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
everything is just kicking when you can

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.199 
everything is just kicking when you can
connect<00:04:12.489> with<00:04:12.580> somebody<00:04:13.319> even<00:04:14.319> if<00:04:14.890> there's

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
connect with somebody even if there's

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.120 
connect with somebody even if there's
maybe<00:04:16.209> a<00:04:16.359> few<00:04:16.690> people<00:04:16.720> in<00:04:17.019> the<00:04:17.109> audience<00:04:17.260> that

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
maybe a few people in the audience that

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:19.680 
maybe a few people in the audience that
can<00:04:18.370> make<00:04:18.519> it<00:04:18.669> worthwhile<00:04:18.940> even<00:04:19.570> though

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
can make it worthwhile even though

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.599 
can make it worthwhile even though
there's<00:04:20.019> no<00:04:20.199> one<00:04:20.380> there<00:04:20.560> even<00:04:21.160> if<00:04:21.220> it's<00:04:21.370> a<00:04:21.430> big

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
there's no one there even if it's a big

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.310 
there's no one there even if it's a big
room<00:04:21.790> of<00:04:21.880> people<00:04:22.150> that<00:04:22.270> don't<00:04:22.389> care<00:04:22.660> it's

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
room of people that don't care it's

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.930 
room of people that don't care it's
pretty<00:04:23.590> hard<00:04:23.830> to<00:04:23.919> bring<00:04:24.100> it<00:04:24.280> but<00:04:24.699> if<00:04:24.790> there's

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
pretty hard to bring it but if there's

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.310 
pretty hard to bring it but if there's
like<00:04:25.120> one<00:04:25.270> person<00:04:25.630> is<00:04:25.690> really<00:04:25.840> getting<00:04:26.110> into

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
like one person is really getting into

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.870 
like one person is really getting into
it<00:04:26.350> makes<00:04:27.010> all<00:04:27.220> the<00:04:27.310> difference<00:04:27.400> in<00:04:27.610> the<00:04:27.669> world

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
it makes all the difference in the world

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:43.629 
it makes all the difference in the world
and<00:04:28.419> I<00:04:28.540> can<00:04:28.720> perform<00:04:29.250> as<00:04:30.250> good<00:04:30.430> as<00:04:30.550> I<00:04:30.639> can

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:43.639 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:46.209 

you<00:04:44.060> might<00:04:44.210> be<00:04:44.330> really<00:04:44.539> nervous<00:04:44.840> though<00:04:45.219> you

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:38.780 

when<00:05:37.440> it<00:05:37.530> comes<00:05:37.740> down<00:05:37.830> to<00:05:38.130> it<00:05:38.250> you're<00:05:38.580> doing

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:38.790
