00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:10.950
 stood on skis 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.400
 a day less training otherwise how 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.350
 so far the day is not very 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.910
 So lost on saturday on ski 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.949
 on the way because you already knew 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.480
 that the week becomes difficult we travel 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.519
 but now anyway tomorrow on the 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.249
 glacier and that's fine 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.679
 that there are three more weeks now 

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:30.810
 I will try that as much as possible 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:31.169
 to use in the best possible way in shape 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.910
 come 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:34.530
 what 's going on in these three? 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.160
 weeks before the first World Cup 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.449
 race is really so intense 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.660
 again at the fine-tuning of 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:44.910
 material work this last one 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.160
 good feeling hopefully pick up a bit 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.670
 get in the mood that is always after 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.739
 weeks of training you have to first 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.079
 yes that is really record that sits 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.239
 then again starts with the full throttle 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.339
 new material is of course also 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.429
 getting used to an extra load like that 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:03.719
 runs with the yes that is thank God 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:05.489
 the same for everyone 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.680
 that is already a change so it 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.200
 is special if the conditions are more 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.960
 are soft and the speed 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.030
 low then they are really hard 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.350
 around the bend but as I said that for 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.170
 all the same and you will see who is 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.430
 we could get used to it the best 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.780
 let's make a story like that 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.729
 this giant slalom of these 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.530
 is called royal discipline 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.040
 do you have such an explanation what the 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.719
 giant slalom so so special I 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.280
 think in giant slalom is just the 

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:34.799
 Density was almost the highest 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.790
 slalom drive from giant slalom and even 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.890
 Most of the speed disciplines 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.740
 at least drive too 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.219
 training giant-slate yes it is 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.799
 simply the base discipline, it is the 

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:49.140
 ski alpine sweeping bad is in 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.119
 asked you are happy or says 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.520
 Well, not always so good 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.110
 yes that is always saying that always one 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.189
 bit has zwiegespalten the feeling 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.979
 if of course you are looking forward to the 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.640
 a side that gets started 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.829
 beautiful race with many 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.119
 spectators groomed the piste that is 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.170
 an awesome atmosphere 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.219
 but of course it is very 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.170
 difficult and it is the first one 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:11.160
 You do not really know where 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.400
 is it and how did I have said 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.989
 do not always have 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.489
 The last one has done so well 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.040
 years but at least I have already 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:21.069
 good passages driven networld that 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.269
 just aim for two good passes 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.610
 Get a good one and really 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:26.200
 Season start to lie down over the newspaper 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.060
 lindsey opens at once 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.549
 von lisbon wants to drive at the 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.000
 Men finally louis like standing 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:34.209
 you too 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.129
 Do you think that could happen to me? 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.900
 think if it's approved for it 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:39.760
 Many people have to talk about it 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.920
 pr-gag i dont think that's it 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.140
 I think she just becomes that 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.909
 training purposes for the departure week 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.659
 then where we also in lake louis 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:49.030
 would drive 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:50.170
 It will probably be training there 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.909
 want to use for it 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.340
 I do not think it would be necessary 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:57.069
 as they often do in recent years 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.319
 But we have dominated 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:00.069
 it will surprise you too 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:01.540
 conceivable 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.790
 to take a ride with a man 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.170
 training purposes have been training yes 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.629
 sometimes if you like our workout 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.519
 Organize yourself through our associations 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:12.159
 then you are already together 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:15.010
 just overseas or in america if 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:16.329
 the slopes are limited and that is 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.230
 then it's interesting with the 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:20.410
 to measure mr 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.449
 with direct race against the drive 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.579
 As I said this is on a stretch like 

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:26.889
 lake louis where we also the week anyway 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:30.549
 After that, that's okay 

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:31.780
 the streak in kitzbÃ¼hel well who the 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:33.909
 next rides were like 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.310
 there you go out or at least 

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:37.750
 if so prepared and by the 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.750
 as well as with the gentlemen 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:43.690
 then I believe that he as 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.979
 suicidal but yes with one 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.090
 other course setting and maybe with 

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:47.530
 a bit easier 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.239
 it would at least be piste preparation 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.709
 not impossible for us down there too 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:53.500
 go skiing we can yes and 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.639
 also the men's ski is virtually introduced 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.319
 the topic because the actually complete 

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:57.879
 through or are you thinking then again 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:01.000
 because you work in the direction 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:02.379
 yes by the material change now is 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.970
 it definitely through so the 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:05.379
 shoot and become longer less 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.199
 actually fitted similar to the 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:11.049
 mens ski so far were and again 

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:12.879
 to follow up and quasi on the new 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:13.840
 so to go the new men's models 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:15.849
 I do not think that's for us 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.320
 So I can not work 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:19.570
 imagine that the countries made but 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.729
 we will still be free to watch 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.080
 competitive wind do you think it 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:25.630
 again the usual suspects or 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.370
 come as so young extended to Vienna 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.100
 Anna Fenninger's really good now 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.630
 were last year come to everyone 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.060
 but after some you have to 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.470
 quite realistically say that actually 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.250
 the lens nobody can beat in the 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.530
 total world cup 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:41.890
 there are certainly one or the other boy 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:44.260
 the times in a race there maybe 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:46.180
 can drive off the front especially in 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.400
 the technical disciplines but in the 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.720
 Overall World Cup with constancy and with 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.500
 the class the lens especially 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:54.580
 Last year showed no chance 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.550
 ask for your personal goals 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.410
 this season so it is for me at 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.210
 beginning of october still a bit too 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.520
 I have to define that early 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.230
 First, the preparation still good rum 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.850
 bring the next three weeks 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:08.290
 really train properly again 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:11.200
 the fine-tuning of the material 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:13.450
 work again and then let 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.460
 first go in peace and I believe 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.650
 that I will only be in the course of the first 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.830
 weeks define my concrete goals 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.830
 can
