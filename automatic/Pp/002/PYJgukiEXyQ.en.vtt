00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.629
 hi guys how are you studying 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.759
 they were riding today we are going to 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:19.039
 show a routine for you to achieve 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:20.840
 develop your pecs 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:23.180
 in this opportunity our friend that yes 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.910
 will show us each one of the 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.849
 exercises that come in this routine as well 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.369
 that are ready let's watch the video 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:35.490
 let's start with the first exercise the 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:38.550
 flat bench press with dumbbells 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:41.520
 in the flat bank you pay the 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:46.050
 palms of your hands should be looking 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:49.050
 all the time forward and proceed 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:53.100
 to perform the press low cufflinks 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:56.670
 towards the height of your lower chest and then 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.820
 the raised ones until your arms are 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.240
 vertical very important is that you do not touch 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.460
 the cufflinks 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:07.159
 and how can you see 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.770
 the arms only rise up to the 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:13.090
 vertical and so keep a constant 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.090
 tension in the pectorals 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.469
 in that way the feet well planted in 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.039
 the floor so they give you more 

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:21.039
 stability 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.530
 the second exercise in this routine is 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.799
 the inclined bench press with bar 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:36.530
 the separation between both hands should be 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:39.280
 so that when you lower the bar you allow yourself 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.890
 that your forearms remain 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:45.560
 perpendicular to the ground ok that's 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.490
 the grip that you're going to use in this in 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.700
 this exercise 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.210
 You must go down to the height of your chest 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.210
 high 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.900
 very important note that the forearms 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.530
 when going down they are perpendicular with the 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.780
 ground 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.760
 if you use a closed grip you are going to 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.429
 make your triceps are the ones that 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:11.700
 mostly intervene to raise the 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:14.630
 weight or is very important that you have 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.090
 be careful with the grip 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.470
 your hip should always be fixed 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.190
 time in the seat you should not 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.190
 lift it 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.960
 let's go to the third exercise the press of 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:33.300
 flat bench with dumbbells but this time 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:35.960
 the grip we're going to use is the 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.960
 neutral 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:42.300
 this is a combination between the press and 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.460
 the openings the palms of your hands 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.980
 they should be looking at each other all the 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:50.120
 time is not that in the same way you're going to 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.370
 go down to the height of your chest below 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.159
 and thus be able to work properly 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:59.080
 pectorals the non-execution until the 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:59.080
 vertical you must raise the dumbbells 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.350
 and feet well planted on the ground 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:07.720
 all the time 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:10.480
 and finally we go to the crossover 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.830
 this is an exercise to isolate your 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:17.590
 pectorals as you can notice here 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:20.200
 fundamentally matters the technique does not 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:23.080
 the weight you are lifting 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.690
 you must ensure to the maximum that you feel 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:29.740
 that your pectorals are working 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:32.580
 they stretch when you go up and you squeeze them 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.580
 to go down 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:43.180
 a tip that we give you is that you tighten a 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:45.790
 second there and then you just upload that 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.209
 will help give more pumping to your 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:51.459
 pectorals you should also keep in mind 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:54.010
 that your back should be all the time 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:56.739
 straight without hamstring back 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.989
 you are definitely not going to work 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:00.760
 correctly your pectorals and therefore 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:04.060
 you will not achieve the results that both 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:07.450
 you want so very important all the 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:09.730
 time the back straight always 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:13.210
 worrying about squeezing your pecs 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:15.310
 with other arms are ahead 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:16.900
 well now yes here are the series 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:21.990
 repetitions and rest between each 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.990
 series for this pectorals routine 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.370

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:30.900
