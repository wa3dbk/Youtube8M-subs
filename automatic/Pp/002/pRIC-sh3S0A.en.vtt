00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.650 

then<00:00:32.590> I<00:00:32.739> made<00:00:32.950> two<00:00:33.220> cake<00:00:33.579> layers<00:00:33.910> and<00:00:34.300> I<00:00:34.480> use

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.150 

to<00:00:58.390> make<00:00:58.570> the<00:00:58.690> confetti<00:00:59.050> cake<00:00:59.350> I<00:00:59.559> use<00:00:59.829> the<00:00:59.980> same

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160 
to make the confetti cake I use the same

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.279 
to make the confetti cake I use the same
color<00:01:00.670> as<00:01:00.940> the<00:01:01.059> vanilla<00:01:01.359> cake<00:01:01.539> but<00:01:01.870> this<00:01:02.050> time

00:01:02.279 --> 00:01:02.289 
color as the vanilla cake but this time

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:27.270 
color as the vanilla cake but this time
I<00:01:02.320> just<00:01:02.469> mixed<00:01:02.920> in<00:01:03.129> confetti<00:01:03.609> sprinkles

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.610 

and<00:01:27.400> make<00:01:28.240> sure<00:01:28.270> you<00:01:28.480> cut<00:01:28.690> the<00:01:28.810> slices<00:01:29.260> slowly

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:29.620 
and make sure you cut the slices slowly

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:37.740 
and make sure you cut the slices slowly
so<00:01:29.980> the<00:01:30.160> colors<00:01:30.460> won't<00:01:30.670> smear<00:01:30.970> together

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.290 

and<00:01:38.100> once<00:01:39.100> you've<00:01:39.340> cut<00:01:39.580> the<00:01:39.700> slices<00:01:39.940> you<00:01:40.270> can

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
and once you've cut the slices you can

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.480 
and once you've cut the slices you can
use<00:01:40.570> a<00:01:40.600> needle<00:01:40.900> tool<00:01:41.200> or<00:01:41.500> a<00:01:41.530> toothpick<00:01:41.800> to<00:01:42.040> add

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
use a needle tool or a toothpick to add

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:48.430 
use a needle tool or a toothpick to add
texture<00:01:43.150> to<00:01:43.180> the<00:01:43.390> cake

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.920 

I<00:01:48.500> bake<00:01:49.370> the<00:01:49.520> cakes<00:01:49.730> for<00:01:49.970> about<00:01:50.120> 10<00:01:50.420> minutes<00:01:50.600> at

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
I bake the cakes for about 10 minutes at

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.680 
I bake the cakes for about 10 minutes at
200<00:01:51.620> degrees<00:01:51.650> Fahrenheit<00:01:52.220> and<00:01:52.790> this<00:01:53.330> is<00:01:53.480> just

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
200 degrees Fahrenheit and this is just

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.090 
200 degrees Fahrenheit and this is just
to<00:01:53.870> make<00:01:54.050> them<00:01:54.230> hard<00:01:54.470> so<00:01:54.560> I<00:01:54.710> can<00:01:54.860> put<00:01:55.010> the

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
to make them hard so I can put the

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.320 
to make them hard so I can put the
frosting<00:01:55.340> on

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.230 

I<00:01:59.770> wrapped<00:02:00.770> white<00:02:01.070> clay<00:02:01.280> around<00:02:01.700> the<00:02:01.790> edges

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
I wrapped white clay around the edges

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.210 
I wrapped white clay around the edges
and<00:02:02.420> the<00:02:02.570> top<00:02:02.810> of<00:02:03.050> the<00:02:03.320> cake<00:02:03.530> to<00:02:03.770> look<00:02:03.800> like<00:02:03.950> the

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
and the top of the cake to look like the

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.870 
and the top of the cake to look like the
frosting<00:02:04.700> and<00:02:05.890> then<00:02:06.890> I<00:02:07.040> used<00:02:07.280> a<00:02:07.430> rolling<00:02:07.730> pin

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
frosting and then I used a rolling pin

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:19.390 
frosting and then I used a rolling pin
to<00:02:08.180> smooth<00:02:08.479> out<00:02:08.600> the<00:02:08.660> clay

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.369 

and<00:02:19.489> make<00:02:20.180> sure<00:02:20.209> you<00:02:20.450> trim<00:02:20.689> off<00:02:20.810> any<00:02:21.079> extra

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:21.379 
and make sure you trim off any extra

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:23.259 
and make sure you trim off any extra
frosting<00:02:21.890> that's<00:02:22.040> in<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:22.459> front<00:02:22.819> where<00:02:23.120> the

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
frosting that's in the front where the

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:26.460 
frosting that's in the front where the
cake<00:02:23.450> is<00:02:23.720> or<00:02:24.019> on<00:02:24.170> the<00:02:24.230> bottom

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
cake is or on the bottom

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.800 
cake is or on the bottom
and<00:02:26.820> now<00:02:27.820> I'm<00:02:27.910> going<00:02:28.060> to<00:02:28.150> do<00:02:28.240> the<00:02:28.360> same<00:02:28.540> thing

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
and now I'm going to do the same thing

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.390 
and now I'm going to do the same thing
to<00:02:28.960> the<00:02:29.080> confetti<00:02:29.410> cake<00:02:29.680> and<00:02:29.920> add<00:02:30.100> pink

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
to the confetti cake and add pink

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:37.560 
to the confetti cake and add pink
frosting<00:02:30.940> to<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:31.240> sides<00:02:31.480> and<00:02:31.720> the<00:02:31.810> top

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.930 

to<00:02:38.570> make<00:02:38.750> the<00:02:38.870> trim<00:02:39.170> for<00:02:39.380> the<00:02:39.470> cake<00:02:39.680> I<00:02:39.860> use<00:02:40.220> the

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
to make the trim for the cake I use the

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.030 
to make the trim for the cake I use the
same<00:02:41.240> color<00:02:41.750> as<00:02:41.990> the<00:02:42.140> frosting<00:02:42.620> so<00:02:42.800> I'm<00:02:42.890> using

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
same color as the frosting so I'm using

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.720 
same color as the frosting so I'm using
pink<00:02:43.430> and<00:02:43.670> a<00:02:44.240> number<00:02:44.420> 14<00:02:45.020> star<00:02:45.350> tip<00:02:45.620> and<00:02:45.890> I<00:02:46.460> made

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
pink and a number 14 star tip and I made

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.360 
pink and a number 14 star tip and I made
little<00:02:47.060> dollops<00:02:47.570> and<00:02:47.810> rounded<00:02:48.740> them<00:02:48.920> at<00:02:49.130> the

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
little dollops and rounded them at the

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.130 
little dollops and rounded them at the
bottom<00:02:49.550> so<00:02:49.910> they<00:02:50.060> would<00:02:50.240> look<00:02:50.780> like<00:02:50.840> they<00:02:51.080> were

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
bottom so they would look like they were

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.620 
bottom so they would look like they were
curved<00:02:51.560> and<00:02:51.890> then<00:02:52.550> I<00:02:52.580> added<00:02:52.850> a<00:02:53.030> bunch<00:02:53.210> to<00:02:53.510> the

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
curved and then I added a bunch to the

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.050 
curved and then I added a bunch to the
top<00:02:53.870> and<00:02:54.200> to<00:02:54.410> the<00:02:54.440> bottom<00:02:54.770> of<00:02:54.890> the<00:02:54.980> cake<00:02:55.190> and<00:02:55.460> I

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
top and to the bottom of the cake and I

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.520 
top and to the bottom of the cake and I
did<00:02:56.270> that<00:02:56.450> for<00:02:56.660> the<00:02:56.720> pink<00:02:56.990> and<00:02:57.200> the<00:02:57.380> white<00:02:57.410> and

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
did that for the pink and the white and

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.140 
did that for the pink and the white and
once<00:03:00.530> I<00:03:00.650> added<00:03:00.830> all<00:03:01.040> the<00:03:01.190> trim<00:03:01.490> I<00:03:01.670> bake<00:03:02.000> the

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
once I added all the trim I bake the

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.690 
once I added all the trim I bake the
cakes<00:03:02.390> again<00:03:02.540> for<00:03:03.080> about<00:03:03.260> 10<00:03:03.470> minutes<00:03:03.680> just<00:03:04.550> so

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
cakes again for about 10 minutes just so

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.350 
cakes again for about 10 minutes just so
they<00:03:04.820> would<00:03:04.970> be<00:03:05.090> hard<00:03:05.270> and<00:03:06.910> if<00:03:07.910> you're<00:03:08.090> worried

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
they would be hard and if you're worried

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.850 
they would be hard and if you're worried
about<00:03:08.390> the<00:03:08.630> cakes<00:03:08.840> burning<00:03:09.350> they<00:03:09.530> won't

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
about the cakes burning they won't

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.680 
about the cakes burning they won't
because<00:03:10.370> you're<00:03:10.910> going<00:03:11.060> to<00:03:11.150> be<00:03:11.240> baking<00:03:11.570> them

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
because you're going to be baking them

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.110 
because you're going to be baking them
at<00:03:11.870> 200<00:03:12.560> degrees<00:03:12.860> which<00:03:13.160> is<00:03:13.370> much<00:03:13.700> lower<00:03:13.970> than

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
at 200 degrees which is much lower than

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.510 
at 200 degrees which is much lower than
the<00:03:14.330> recommended<00:03:14.690> temperature<00:03:15.170> so<00:03:16.070> you<00:03:16.130> can

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:16.520 
the recommended temperature so you can

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.860 
the recommended temperature so you can
bake<00:03:16.670> them<00:03:16.850> for<00:03:17.000> a<00:03:17.060> longer<00:03:17.480> amount<00:03:17.540> of<00:03:17.810> time

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
bake them for a longer amount of time

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:25.550 
bake them for a longer amount of time
and<00:03:18.350> they<00:03:18.500> won't<00:03:18.710> burn<00:03:19.010> but<00:03:19.340> they<00:03:19.490> will<00:03:19.760> Harden

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.309 

and<00:03:25.940> now<00:03:26.940> I'm<00:03:27.060> adding<00:03:27.209> frosting<00:03:27.900> and<00:03:28.110> more

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
and now I'm adding frosting and more

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:33.050 
and now I'm adding frosting and more
trim<00:03:28.590> to<00:03:28.800> the<00:03:28.920> slices<00:03:29.340> that<00:03:29.490> I<00:03:29.550> cut<00:03:30.110> and<00:03:31.940> to<00:03:32.940> add

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
trim to the slices that I cut and to add
