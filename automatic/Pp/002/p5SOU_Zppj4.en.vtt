00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.540 
I think that's been the major thing that
a<00:02:09.479> major<00:02:10.380> reason<00:02:10.709> we've<00:02:11.009> been<00:02:11.160> so<00:02:11.340> successful

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
and the other thing is you know the bars

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.070 
and the other thing is you know the bars
race<00:02:14.700> extremely<00:02:15.239> hot<00:02:15.420> and<00:02:15.540> I've<00:02:15.660> always<00:02:15.810> said

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080

think that the most important role model
in<00:02:48.900> worlds<00:02:49.230> high<00:02:49.350> school<00:02:49.590> coaches<00:02:49.830> because<00:02:50.040> we

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
in worlds high school coaches because we

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.550 
in worlds high school coaches because we
spend<00:02:50.519> more<00:02:50.670> time<00:02:50.880> we're<00:02:51.239> really<00:02:51.989> the<00:02:52.260> these

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
spend more time we're really the these

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.350 
spend more time we're really the these
high<00:02:52.709> school<00:02:52.950> students<00:02:53.310> in<00:02:53.459> their<00:02:53.550> panic<00:02:53.940> or

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
high school students in their panic or

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.540 
high school students in their panic or
anybody<00:02:54.780> else<00:02:55.019> so<00:02:55.260> it's<00:02:55.830> just<00:02:56.100> an<00:02:56.220> honor<00:02:56.340> to<00:02:56.459> be
