00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:25.300

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:35.050
 on various server I will say I 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.980

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.829
 it's with a macro so I'll tell you 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.899
 would put in descriptions of 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:48.640
 download up 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:52.120
 so we go to that but orderly already 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.629
 open all good for already puts it 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.629
 open his arms 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:04.030
 so I did not delete it so puts in 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:05.640
 support on news up so for example chef 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.479
 anna cros the task 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.340

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:12.280
 makarov i'm going to make it simpler 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:18.670
 the mackerel that made it's number 2 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:24.670
 so I delete it from leds magro game 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:28.660
 on a trick it's good me touch that being 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.550
 Actu is therefore already the key I 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.800
 will choose 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.810
 so it's the touch of the pavement 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:39.580
 digital 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:41.910
 so the thing the appointment this will be slash 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.300
 fidh 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:49.450
 after it must be done wrong will put slash 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:52.539
 after pressing a deer by clicking 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.789
 erase whiting erase points on press 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:56.380
 on the f so it goes automatically 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:58.300
 in capital letters of not worth it 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.429
 try to remove it or whatever 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:13.690
 do that sheed after that removes her face 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:19.030
 my normal insert fidh the up is 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:26.260

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:29.470
 exit so the 2 we will test all that yes 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:32.310
 why does not it work 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.310
 my computer to plant 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:44.379
 two short minutes to succeed too 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:52.400
 abscient password it's okay 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:57.379

00:02:52.400 --> 00:03:03.500
 will walk macro number 4 cpsc come to an end 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:10.819
 Here they eat normally computer 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:16.689
 it's good I told myself side to which 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:18.889
 are those open was waiting for factions 

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:22.489
 wa maybe I do not hang on 

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:24.319
 how are we doing so it's okay 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:28.159

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.879
 orders 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:39.889
