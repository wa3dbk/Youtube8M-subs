00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
put together drawing is how we let the

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.729 
put together drawing is how we let the
ideas<00:02:35.819> in<00:02:36.060> our<00:02:36.150> head<00:02:36.510> escape<00:02:37.109> into<00:02:37.439> the<00:02:37.650> real

world for others to see and understand
it's<00:02:41.760> how<00:02:42.000> we<00:02:42.060> form<00:02:42.450> simple<00:02:43.200> ideas<00:02:43.680> into

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
it's how we form simple ideas into
