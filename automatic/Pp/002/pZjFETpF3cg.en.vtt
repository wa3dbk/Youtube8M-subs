 that is street is very good to be 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.750
 here on the water in more places 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:45.880
 he had not been able to be in the 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:49.010
 water I do not think any house and I was 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:51.800
 positioned water and all sad but already 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.500
 be in the zoo Guadalajara is 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.150
 adapting well has no problems with the 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.600
 people really that people see it and 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.310
 that's not very calm in animal that 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.880
 we test the people all this is 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.430
 a habitat 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:09.430
 nothing else attends for a temporary time 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.870
 truth is based here between three 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.780
 weeks plus or minus three to four 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.209
 weeks from here will happen with one with 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.130
 a female with her partner that we have 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.620
 right here zoo on the other way 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:23.370
 to get to know each other and see if they can 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.370
 get along 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:29.140
 little ones 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:31.810
 hey and he's eating a roof 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:34.060
 We are giving chicken and fish fish 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:38.410
 what kind of fish with carp 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:41.520
 normal this he the reptiles grow 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:45.010
 depending on the space they have and the 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:49.330
 place where discretion are 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:51.400
 normal how do I get it if I could 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.730
 say that here is going to grow a little bit 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:58.170
 faster but where I had it did not 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.170
 it took a little more space 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:07.050
 the truth is not easy it is not easy everything 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.880
 it was a lot of movement everywhere 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:12.060
 It is always a risk to manage an animal 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.740
 of these not if there's always always a lot 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.320
 with a lot of risk always when you're 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:19.620
 with animals crocodiles or snake 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:21.840
 We saw Ricardo there who is good at 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:25.140
 many people from the zoo and vegetables 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:27.820
 Here is Ricardo, we are going to ask him 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:31.000
 our producer the microphone 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.870
 I am before to talk to us is from 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.200
 How is it going 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:37.360
 we are here as in court 2 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.760
 I'm going to share you with a microphone 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:42.150
 car 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:45.120
 it has been like this 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:47.930
 with 18 and here in this good new home 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:51.110
 he looks very calm he seems to like it 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:53.570
 he was not looking for water 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:56.810
 it seems that this community that is 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:59.750
 comfortable that it continues for which is going to be 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:02.480
 now his new life in this zoo and 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:05.690
 in this good portal first we have to 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.680
 check cristhie really healthy and if you 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:09.980
 they are going to do some tests of 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:12.380
 laboratory to confirm your health 

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:16.050
 let's regulate your diet a little 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:18.460
 because it is more habit of psa 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:21.640
 essentially that is the next step 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:24.580
 and then later we will try to put it together 

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:27.940
 with a female hey how do you make her 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:34.120
 analysis to a crocodile with analysis 

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:35.510
 clinician who draws blood if he is taking 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:38.510
 samples 

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:38.510
 discrete 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:47.610
 If I do, I'll be an exam 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:49.740
 they see me they come to do me they squeeze 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:53.460
 that go out and vein and so on 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:55.650
 that's very very common in humans that 

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:57.660
 they are seen in our veins perfectly 

00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:00.110
 the animals is very complicated and in a 

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:06.160
 better is what the skin is so much 

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:08.930
 to hide the veins but 

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:10.880
 we know more or less their location and there 

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:13.550
 what to look for there are two points where 

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:15.740
 we take the blood sample that can 

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:17.810
 be one in the back of the head 

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:20.990
 exactly in the neck there we find 

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:24.200
 a very thick vein and it is easy to take 

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:26.930
 the sample and the other point is at the base 

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:30.970
 of the tail and also of the half there 

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:30.970
 runs another vein very very very good 

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.150
 ah
