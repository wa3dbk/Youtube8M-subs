do<00:02:18.709> is<00:02:19.010> repeat<00:02:19.519> the<00:02:19.550> same<00:02:19.819> steps<00:02:20.180> and<00:02:20.420> then<00:02:20.660> you

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
do is repeat the same steps and then you

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.050 
do is repeat the same steps and then you
definitely<00:02:21.110> want<00:02:21.379> to<00:02:21.650> let<00:02:21.860> all<00:02:22.190> these<00:02:22.640> dry

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
definitely want to let all these dry

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.420 
definitely want to let all these dry
before<00:02:23.450> using<00:02:23.690> them<00:02:23.989> so<00:02:24.260> I<00:02:24.560> would<00:02:24.980> recommend

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
before using them so I would recommend

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:26.949 
before using them so I would recommend
putting<00:02:25.700> something<00:02:26.030> to<00:02:26.300> support<00:02:26.750> with<00:02:26.930> a

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
putting something to support with a

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:28.390 
putting something to support with a
paper<00:02:27.200> clip<00:02:27.319> so<00:02:27.650> that<00:02:27.800> the<00:02:27.950> paper<00:02:28.129> clip

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
paper clip so that the paper clip

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.530 
paper clip so that the paper clip
doesn't<00:02:28.640> bend<00:02:29.180> down<00:02:29.450> while<00:02:29.810> it's<00:02:29.959> drying

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.819 

moving<00:02:35.540> onto<00:02:35.689> the<00:02:35.810> ribbon<00:02:36.079> paperclips<00:02:36.590> all

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:36.829 
moving onto the ribbon paperclips all

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:38.170 
moving onto the ribbon paperclips all
you<00:02:36.920> want<00:02:37.040> to<00:02:37.129> do<00:02:37.250> is<00:02:37.400> take<00:02:37.579> a<00:02:37.609> piece<00:02:37.849> of<00:02:37.969> ribbon

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
you want to do is take a piece of ribbon

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.030 
you want to do is take a piece of ribbon
and<00:02:38.420> Center<00:02:38.840> it<00:02:38.930> on<00:02:39.079> the<00:02:39.140> paperclip<00:02:39.680> you<00:02:39.920> want

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
and Center it on the paperclip you want

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.280 
and Center it on the paperclip you want
to<00:02:40.129> take<00:02:40.280> one<00:02:40.459> side<00:02:40.730> and<00:02:41.060> feed<00:02:41.930> it<00:02:42.049> through

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
to take one side and feed it through

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.410 
to take one side and feed it through
from<00:02:42.590> the<00:02:43.069> back<00:02:43.370> if<00:02:43.640> that<00:02:43.760> makes<00:02:43.969> sense<00:02:44.269> you

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
from the back if that makes sense you

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.940 
from the back if that makes sense you
want<00:02:44.569> to<00:02:44.629> do<00:02:44.719> that<00:02:44.870> for<00:02:45.109> both<00:02:45.319> sides<00:02:45.650> so<00:02:45.920> it

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
want to do that for both sides so it

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.190 
want to do that for both sides so it
looks<00:02:46.129> something<00:02:46.340> like<00:02:46.489> this

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
looks something like this

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.539 
looks something like this
before<00:02:48.200> pulling<00:02:48.409> it<00:02:48.650> what<00:02:48.920> you<00:02:49.010> want<00:02:49.159> to<00:02:49.219> do<00:02:49.340> is

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549 
before pulling it what you want to do is

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:51.940 
before pulling it what you want to do is
turn<00:02:49.819> it<00:02:49.879> to<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:50.930> back<00:02:51.109> and<00:02:51.379> then<00:02:51.500> put<00:02:51.739> some

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
turn it to the back and then put some

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.940 
turn it to the back and then put some
superglue<00:02:52.400> just<00:02:52.790> a<00:02:52.879> dot<00:02:53.409> right<00:02:54.409> at<00:02:54.530> the<00:02:54.680> top

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
superglue just a dot right at the top

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.890 
superglue just a dot right at the top
before<00:02:55.549> you<00:02:55.670> pull<00:02:55.939> it<00:02:56.150> so<00:02:56.540> we're<00:02:56.689> just<00:02:56.720> gonna

and then after that you want to go ahead
and<00:04:33.910> glue<00:04:34.450> that<00:04:34.690> part<00:04:34.960> on<00:04:35.110> top<00:04:35.350> of<00:04:35.560> the<00:04:35.710> other

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:35.890 
and glue that part on top of the other

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.780 
and glue that part on top of the other
piece<00:04:36.220> the<00:04:36.490> bigger<00:04:36.670> piece<00:04:36.970> so<00:04:37.660> that<00:04:37.690> it<00:04:38.020> looks

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
piece the bigger piece so that it looks

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.190 
piece the bigger piece so that it looks
like<00:04:39.790> there's<00:04:40.000> ribbon<00:04:40.420> coming<00:04:40.840> out<00:04:40.930> from<00:04:41.110> the

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
like there's ribbon coming out from the

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.480 
like there's ribbon coming out from the
back<00:04:41.380> and<00:04:41.620> that<00:04:41.800> makes<00:04:42.070> sense

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
back and that makes sense

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.490 
back and that makes sense
and<00:04:42.640> then<00:04:43.240> after<00:04:43.660> that<00:04:43.840> you<00:04:44.050> just<00:04:44.080> want<00:04:44.350> to<00:04:44.380> go

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
and then after that you just want to go

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.350 
and then after that you just want to go
ahead<00:04:44.710> and<00:04:44.860> take<00:04:45.040> that<00:04:45.070> center<00:04:45.520> part<00:04:45.820> and<00:04:45.940> just

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
ahead and take that center part and just

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:52.820 
ahead and take that center part and just
glue<00:04:46.600> it<00:04:46.630> and<00:04:46.960> wrap<00:04:47.140> it<00:04:47.290> around

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.710 

and<00:04:52.979> while<00:04:53.729> it's<00:04:53.970> drying<00:04:54.240> I<00:04:54.419> would<00:04:54.569> suggest

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
and while it's drying I would suggest

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.390 
and while it's drying I would suggest
taking<00:04:55.080> a<00:04:55.409> small<00:04:55.710> paper<00:04:55.919> clip<00:04:56.190> and<00:04:56.340> just

taking a small paper clip and just

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.830 
taking a small paper clip and just
clipping<00:04:56.789> it<00:04:57.000> so<00:04:57.150> that<00:04:57.330> it<00:04:57.419> doesn't<00:04:57.569> come

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
clipping it so that it doesn't come

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.779 
clipping it so that it doesn't come
apart<00:04:57.960> while<00:04:58.379> it's<00:04:58.620> drying<00:04:58.949> and<00:04:59.220> of<00:04:59.610> course

00:04:59.779 --> 00:04:59.789 
apart while it's drying and of course

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:01.010 
apart while it's drying and of course
after<00:05:00.000> that<00:05:00.270> you<00:05:00.389> can<00:05:00.539> just<00:05:00.659> go<00:05:00.780> ahead<00:05:00.930> and

paper clips all you want to do is take

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:02.930 
paper clips all you want to do is take
your<00:06:00.660> washi<00:06:00.870> tape<00:06:01.169> and<00:06:01.349> fold<00:06:01.740> it<00:06:01.860> in<00:06:02.009> kind<00:06:02.849> of

insert it and then you want to just fold

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:10.249 
insert it and then you want to just fold
them<00:06:07.229> so<00:06:07.289> that<00:06:07.680> they<00:06:08.069> both<00:06:09.080> stick<00:06:10.080> together

00:06:10.249 --> 00:06:10.259 
them so that they both stick together

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:11.540 
them so that they both stick together
just<00:06:10.680> like<00:06:10.740> that<00:06:10.860> I'm<00:06:11.370> pretty

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.550 
just like that I'm pretty

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:12.170 
just like that I'm pretty
self-explanatory

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:12.180 
self-explanatory

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.540 
self-explanatory
and<00:06:13.020> I'm<00:06:13.199> gonna<00:06:13.380> go<00:06:13.500> ahead<00:06:13.620> and<00:06:13.949> snip<00:06:14.310> and

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:14.550 
and I'm gonna go ahead and snip and

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:16.219 
and I'm gonna go ahead and snip and
angle<00:06:14.910> at<00:06:14.970> the<00:06:15.030> top<00:06:15.240> so<00:06:15.569> it<00:06:15.810> just<00:06:15.960> looks<00:06:16.139> like

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:16.229 
angle at the top so it just looks like

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:20.930 
angle at the top so it just looks like
that

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:20.940 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.950

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:25.870 
take a washi tape that's a little bit

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:27.660 
take a washi tape that's a little bit
wider<00:06:26.080> or<00:06:26.470> you<00:06:26.590> can<00:06:26.770> use<00:06:26.890> a<00:06:26.920> skinny<00:06:27.250> one<00:06:27.430> if<00:06:27.580> you

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:27.670 
wider or you can use a skinny one if you

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:29.460 
wider or you can use a skinny one if you
want<00:06:27.880> you're<00:06:28.420> gonna<00:06:28.510> go<00:06:28.690> ahead<00:06:28.780> and<00:06:28.930> feed<00:06:29.320> the

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:31.930 
washi tape through the side and not to

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.080 
washi tape through the side and not to
the<00:06:32.050> top<00:06:32.290> this<00:06:32.530> time<00:06:32.590> make<00:06:33.460> sure<00:06:33.490> you<00:06:33.790> fit<00:06:34.000> it

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:34.090 
the top this time make sure you fit it

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:35.490 
the top this time make sure you fit it
to<00:06:34.210> the<00:06:34.240> side<00:06:34.570> where<00:06:34.840> it<00:06:35.020> won't<00:06:35.170> get<00:06:35.380> in<00:06:35.470> the

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:35.500 
to the side where it won't get in the

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.560 
to the side where it won't get in the
way<00:06:35.590> of<00:06:35.920> the<00:06:36.070> paper<00:06:36.250> clip<00:06:36.550> clipping<00:06:37.150> onto<00:06:37.330> a

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:37.570 
way of the paper clip clipping onto a

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:39.480 
way of the paper clip clipping onto a
piece<00:06:37.930> of<00:06:37.960> paper<00:06:38.170> and<00:06:38.650> then<00:06:39.100> once<00:06:39.340> you're<00:06:39.460> done

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:39.490 
piece of paper and then once you're done

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:41.190 
piece of paper and then once you're done
with<00:06:39.640> that<00:06:39.760> you<00:06:40.060> can<00:06:40.090> go<00:06:40.330> ahead<00:06:40.420> and<00:06:40.750> cut<00:06:41.020> a

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:41.200 
with that you can go ahead and cut a

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.140 
with that you can go ahead and cut a
triangle<00:06:41.860> at<00:06:42.130> the<00:06:42.190> end<00:06:42.370> like<00:06:42.550> I<00:06:42.700> did<00:06:42.880> here<00:06:43.120> so

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:43.150 
triangle at the end like I did here so

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.360 
triangle at the end like I did here so
it<00:06:43.510> looks<00:06:43.690> like<00:06:43.810> a<00:06:44.140> page<00:06:44.350> fly<00:06:44.620> and<00:06:44.920> you're

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:45.370 
it looks like a page fly and you're

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:47.850 
it looks like a page fly and you're
pretty<00:06:45.550> much<00:06:45.640> done
