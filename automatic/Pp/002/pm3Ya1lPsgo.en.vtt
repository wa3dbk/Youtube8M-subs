crappy where you're from or if it's good
because<00:01:53.740> I<00:01:54.159> don't<00:01:55.030> know<00:01:55.060> anything<00:01:55.119> about<00:01:55.509> it

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
because I don't know anything about it

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:56.879 
because I don't know anything about it
i'm<00:01:55.899> going<00:01:56.049> to<00:01:56.109> google<00:01:56.380> it<00:01:56.499> and<00:01:56.530> see<00:01:56.649> what<00:01:56.829> i

00:01:56.879 --> 00:01:56.889 
i'm going to google it and see what i

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:58.739 
i'm going to google it and see what i
can<00:01:57.009> find<00:01:57.130> but<00:01:57.609> I<00:01:57.789> also<00:01:58.149> searched<00:01:58.569> the

00:01:58.739 --> 00:01:58.749 
can find but I also searched the

00:01:58.749 --> 00:02:00.120 
can find but I also searched the
ingredients<00:01:59.319> and<00:01:59.469> obviously<00:01:59.829> if<00:01:59.979> it's

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
ingredients and obviously if it's

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.649 
ingredients and obviously if it's
outside<00:02:00.310> of<00:02:00.549> the<00:02:00.670> US<00:02:00.969> it's<00:02:01.149> not<00:02:01.299> going<00:02:01.420> to<00:02:01.509> have

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
outside of the US it's not going to have

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:03.269 
outside of the US it's not going to have
any<00:02:01.779> parabens<00:02:02.229> because<00:02:02.529> the<00:02:02.649> codes<00:02:03.039> are

00:02:03.269 --> 00:02:03.279 
any parabens because the codes are

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:06.510 
any parabens because the codes are
stricter<00:02:04.060> for<00:02:04.329> makeup<00:02:04.840> formulas<00:02:05.409> but<00:02:05.619> they

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
stricter for makeup formulas but they

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.370 
stricter for makeup formulas but they
don't<00:02:06.670> contain<00:02:06.909> parabens<00:02:07.359> so<00:02:07.779> that<00:02:08.050> was<00:02:08.200> good

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
don't contain parabens so that was good

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.770 
don't contain parabens so that was good
I<00:02:08.649> thought<00:02:09.250> to<00:02:09.520> get<00:02:09.670> at<00:02:09.759> the<00:02:09.850> dollar<00:02:10.030> store<00:02:10.119> but

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
I thought to get at the dollar store but

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.550 
I thought to get at the dollar store but
