00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
their weapons are good to go for the

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.490 
their weapons are good to go for the
rest<00:01:01.500> of<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.649> game<00:01:01.829> well<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:03.049> reset<00:01:04.049> teammates

that boom shot and then give it to one
of<00:01:14.010> them<00:01:14.180> um<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.990> think<00:01:16.110> I<00:01:16.590> figured<00:01:16.920> out<00:01:17.040> what

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
of them um I think I figured out what

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.039 
of them um I think I figured out what
causes<00:01:17.610> these<00:01:17.880> idiots<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.540> whip<00:01:18.810> out<00:01:18.930> their

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
causes these idiots to whip out their

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.710 
causes these idiots to whip out their
pistols<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.770> not<00:01:19.890> put<00:01:20.040> them<00:01:20.159> away<00:01:20.310> I<00:01:20.700> think<00:01:21.600> if

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
pistols and not put them away I think if

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.320 
pistols and not put them away I think if
you<00:01:21.990> pull<00:01:22.320> out<00:01:22.350> your<00:01:22.590> pistol<00:01:22.820> they<00:01:23.820> switch<00:01:24.180> to

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
you pull out your pistol they switch to

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.320 
you pull out your pistol they switch to
their<00:01:24.479> pistol<00:01:24.869> but<00:01:25.470> they<00:01:25.560> don't<00:01:25.710> switch<00:01:25.979> back

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
their pistol but they don't switch back

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:32.560 
their pistol but they don't switch back

destroy that barrel to move on in the

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.640 
destroy that barrel to move on in the
level<00:04:27.200> it<00:04:27.980> like<00:04:28.100> creates<00:04:28.400> path<00:04:28.700> or<00:04:28.970> something

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650
