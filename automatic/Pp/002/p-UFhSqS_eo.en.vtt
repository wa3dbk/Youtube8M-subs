00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:12.599
 all man on deck and mens I am 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.329
 yvonne catterfeld and have never landed 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.420
 hired a high the captain me 

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:22.050
 speak pirates sarina in disneys 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.480
 tinkerbell and the pirates felina why 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.269
 Do you have so wants the advice Sarina is 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.050
 the financial administrator for that 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:33.660
 Actually only the responsible is the gloss 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.670
 to distribute but she has just other 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.129
 tasks and experimented with rum 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.760
 although she is not allowed and discovered 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.760
 something new 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.309
 corresponds to it fast as lightning reproducing 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:53.140
 Sarina may start at a certain point 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.269
 no longer perform their task and 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:59.589
 therefore decides the valley of the fairies 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:01:02.110
 leave and become pirates all fair 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:06.820
 exactly we needed a new strength 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:08.290
 and there we found the nice thing about the film 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.850
 I think that's it, that's it 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.979
 a bit wilder and more exciting 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.200
 and adventure richer and through this 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:16.899
 Of course pirates still such a one 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.310
 Contrary to these cases, there is something 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:20.350
 I find her very exciting 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.820
 blue veen gloss stolen without the 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.240
 we can not fly we have to fly it 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.590
 retrieves pirates are perhaps the 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.030
 yes nice pirates yes, of course 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.280
 the sarina unite, of course 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.710
 the fairy so she comes from this world 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:38.740
 this grew up there and breaks but 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:44.340
 also belongs to tigers has ours 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:47.170
 Talents and I now live on Tierfans 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.299
 the one who has the horns on and the 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.100
 his head goes through the wall and the 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:54.070
 is trying something groundbreaking new 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.360
 make and bring themselves and the others 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.630
 in danger 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.899
 yes, that's your plan 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.899
 had worked 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:12.750
 purely on perfect suddenly what is there 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.450
 that happens is very exciting and 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.430
 pretty funny the new Disney 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.290
 Adventure tinkerbell and the pirates 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.770
 I wish you much from the heart 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.770
 pleasure and an incomparable 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.770
 cinemas 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:39.290
 we have to get out of here somehow 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.290
 Sarina you can track at all 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:16.760
 Do you have any idea what that means 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:20.580
 ah, you fritter berliner exchanged no 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.110
 she exchanged our gifts please yes 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.210
 from me is now obviously a water 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.680
 That's why a lot is won 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:34.860
 smaller and I guess you are now 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:37.290
 one quickly flashing again and me out 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:40.040
 me sitting without animals, I become 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.040
 lucky one 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.620
 how come for the big four seasons 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.810
 firm how beautiful that winter is missing 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:53.560
 This time, yes, I think so 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:55.500
 sometimes to the ina why does she have like that? 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.480
 the hail wants 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.159
 she stole the blue veen gloss 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.370
 we can not fly without him 

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:05.049
 have to bring him back pirates 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.500
 maybe they are nice pirates yes 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:09.520
 clear 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:12.319
 a high on the captain 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.830
 Now the hair also makes sense of 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:17.660
 gloss belongs to the style of the miss 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:24.220
 what has she done she has our talents 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:24.220
 Trust and I now live thiersee 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.540
 we have to get the fans back 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:35.120
 Now we have the power of glamor 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:39.830
 we will fly 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.830
 I believe my eye light
