00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.589
 after a complaint arrived in our room 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.599
 of writing we could know the 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.820
 inadmissibility of around 10 citizens 

00:00:06.599 --> 00:00:10.379
 Cubans who were in a 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.749
 marshal airport special room 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:13.769
 sucre de quito for problems with his 

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:16.500
 documentation 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.230
 some of them stayed there more 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.000
 of 30 days we have made the follow-ups 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.759
 from the beginning that case is a subject 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.310
 that beyond that there do not exist 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:27.800
 citizens who are deprived for a moment 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.359
 of your freedom at the airport 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:34.260
 beyond that necessary to 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.750
 let's work on the regulations of the people 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.000
 that are in immigration there was a case 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.070
 particular that of a citizen who had 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.810
 supposedly lost his nationality 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.730
 not to enter the date Cuba- 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.860
 limit according to the rules 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.780
 migrants from that country we did not have 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.130
 access to dialogue with the Caribbean 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.710
 because the treaties 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.270
 international civil aviation 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.910
 protect the identity of people in 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.280
 irregular situation but if we start 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.100
 with jose who resides in the country 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.390
 about two years ago he understood that 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.390
 he lost his rights 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:11.640
 and since you're not Cuban, there has to be another 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.780
 change a measure to see other 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.780
 measures for other changes 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.850
 which shoulder leaves us but this was 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.700
 denied by the ambassador of Cuba 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.920
 jorge rodrÃ­guez clarifies that they do not lose the 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.170
 nationality but rather his residence 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.760
 warned that it is the responsibility of 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.250
 citizens comply with the rules 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.610
 migrants from both countries when 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.620
 spend 11 months 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.380
 they happen to have a condition of 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:41.100
 emigrants is means that only 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:44.130
 can go to Cuba to visit all 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.950
 citizen knows that we must meet the 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.960
 provisions and legality is not 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.030
 responsible for this situation nor the 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.000
 Ecuadorian government nor the government 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.630
 Cuban 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.670
 and that no state can be demanded 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.370
 regularize any citizen if not 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.380
 meets the established requirements 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:04.270
 However, he assured that since 27 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.430
 January a cooperation agreement was signed 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.380
 between both countries where it is established 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.880
 regulations to facilitate procedures 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.100
 Of income 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.410
 nobody can impose on you what 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.910
 accept you to live in your home if 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.980
 you do not agree we 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:23.830
 we ensure that they are not mistreated 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.780
 because you are not being abused as normal 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.560
 no I do not think that either the authority 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:33.910
 Ecuadorian is in that situation 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:36.700
 but neither can we force or demand 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.250
 Ecuadorian authorities who 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.410
 The Ombudsman's Office resides 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.630
 based on the fact that no citizen can 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.970
 Stay retained for more than 48 hours 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.680
 achieved the exit of citizens from 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.110
 Caribbean country Marshal Airport 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.520
 sucre we currently know that they are 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.900
 Free we will continue doing what 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.700
 we put the resources of 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.050
 habeas corpus for approach 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.030
 The authorities 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.740
 so the neira riva will request 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.050
 an early immigration reform for 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.280
 prevent this type of case from recurring 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.530
 with foreigners 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.490
 Maria Fernanda her court ships see her 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.490
