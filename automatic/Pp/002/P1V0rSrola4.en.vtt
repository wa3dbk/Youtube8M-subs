00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:11.299
 over 400 million pesos 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:13.940

 located on world avenue but its 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.759
 young actor from the north coast of the 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.710
 city takes roughly around 12 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:26.509
 years leading the skate good this does not 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.429
 space helps children much more 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:30.999
 guys who do not have a place where 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:35.360
 practice is a safe place with bars 

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:37.520
 not only in fact for skater of what 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.899
 same to kate right for skaters that 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.420
 we are super happy because we finished 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:43.219
 inaugurate a dream that this one comes does 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.770
 many decades to all athletes 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:48.020
 skater of our city we have bought 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.579
 complemented is not true an activity 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.649
 very beautiful that develops in our 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.359
 city like skateboarding and we're very 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:56.030
 happy satisfied that this time is 

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:58.100
 I have already done it but not everything was color 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.870
 roses at the opening of the place and 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.269
 that was the antofa bike group that 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.910
 congregates about 200 young people the gay their 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:07.310
 downloads calling radical turns the 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.409
 Initial preparation of the project 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.780
 we all started together in this project 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.880
 already and the problem was that little by little 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.460
 skaters were doing their grouping and 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.130
 they putting together meetings alone with the 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.619
 mayor of the municipality itself and so it 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.080
 they were like overtaking us 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.399
 making everything we were together and in the 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.220
 previous municipality Mrs. Marcela 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:30.890
 Hernando said park for all others 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:34.970
 with some skaters who asked for more 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:38.840
 spaces like this the spaces are 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:41.390
 there are many empty sites that in the end 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.310
 they end up being pockets of crime of 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.470
 dumps and this you see how you 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.000
 change the look to the city 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.310
 antofagasta a richer speed of 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.929
 chile this is also a job that 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.470
 it is just beginning and clearly 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:56.229
 important but no doubt that we are missing 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.099
 more initiative of this type is missing 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.110
 inauguration that provides a new space 

00:01:58.099 --> 00:02:01.759
 for these skaters while some 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.009
 they claim that they were marginalized from 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:06.909
 initial project and at the same time ask for more 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:09.909
 places the development of this and others 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:09.909
 sports
