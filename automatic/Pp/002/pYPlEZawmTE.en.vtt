00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
take up these earrings for example

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.019 
take up these earrings for example
you've<00:00:28.410> wire<00:00:28.680> wrapped<00:00:28.980> on<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:29.400> them<00:00:29.550> I<00:00:29.730> have<00:00:30.000> I

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
you've wire wrapped on to them I have I

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.840 
you've wire wrapped on to them I have I
mean<00:00:30.300> you<00:00:30.570> could<00:00:30.900> do<00:00:31.349> your<00:00:31.650> standard<00:00:32.279> drops

and<00:00:33.180> dangles<00:00:33.600> on<00:00:33.750> it<00:00:33.930> but<00:00:34.079> I<00:00:34.110> thought<00:00:34.410> let's

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
and dangles on it but I thought let's

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.200 
and dangles on it but I thought let's
take<00:00:34.890> it<00:00:35.040> out<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.190> little<00:00:35.399> bit<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:35.820> let's<00:00:36.000> do<00:00:36.180> a

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
take it out a little bit and let's do a

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.660 
take it out a little bit and let's do a
little<00:00:36.420> more<00:00:36.660> so<00:00:37.440> basically<00:00:37.950> what<00:00:38.280> i've<00:00:38.460> done

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
little more so basically what i've done

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.510 
little more so basically what i've done
is<00:00:38.730> i've<00:00:39.090> used<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.629> 28<00:00:40.410> gauge<00:00:40.649> wire<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.309> wire

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
is i've used the 28 gauge wire to wire

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.490 
is i've used the 28 gauge wire to wire
wrap<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:42.210> gives<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.450> little<00:00:42.600> difference<00:00:43.350> to

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
wrap and it gives a little difference to

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.920 
wrap and it gives a little difference to
the<00:00:44.190> overall<00:00:44.460> appearance<00:00:44.940> yeah<00:00:45.390> now<00:00:45.719> how<00:00:45.870> do

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
the overall appearance yeah now how do

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.990 
the overall appearance yeah now how do
you<00:00:46.050> get<00:00:46.230> started<00:00:46.260> okay<00:00:46.920> so<00:00:46.980> i<00:00:47.219> get<00:00:47.489> started<00:00:47.879> by

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
you get started okay so i get started by

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.270 
you get started okay so i get started by
cutting<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.539> lathe<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.410> I<00:00:49.559> don't<00:00:49.770> cut<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.010> lot

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
cutting a lathe and I don't cut a lot

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.040 
cutting a lathe and I don't cut a lot
because<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:50.789> don't<00:00:50.940> want<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.270> wire<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.690> kink

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
because you don't want the wire to kink

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.920 
because you don't want the wire to kink
and<00:00:52.730> basically<00:00:53.730> I've<00:00:54.000> cut<00:00:54.210> about<00:00:54.510> you<00:00:54.780> know

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
and basically I've cut about you know

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.750 
and basically I've cut about you know
what<00:00:55.140> 12<00:00:55.469> inches<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.219> i'm<00:00:56.370> just<00:00:56.520> going<00:00:56.640> to

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
what 12 inches and i'm just going to

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.670 
what 12 inches and i'm just going to
thread<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.270> through<00:00:57.390> in<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.899> middle<00:00:58.140> section

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
thread it through in the middle section

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.310 
thread it through in the middle section
and<00:00:58.890> i'm<00:00:59.670> going<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.910> pull<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:00.329> down<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:00.960> then

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
and i'm going to pull it down and then

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.250 
and i'm going to pull it down and then
fasten<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.039> back<00:01:02.280> in<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:03.570> know<00:01:03.690> this<00:01:03.870> does

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
fasten it back in and you know this does

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.770 
fasten it back in and you know this does
look<00:01:04.500> tedious<00:01:05.100> but<00:01:05.339> really<00:01:05.790> it's<00:01:06.060> not<00:01:06.420> it's

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
look tedious but really it's not it's

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.039 
look tedious but really it's not it's
just<00:01:06.869> following<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.740> wire<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.490> so<00:01:09.420> now<00:01:09.689> i've

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
just following the wire and so now i've

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.230 
just following the wire and so now i've
got<00:01:10.260> it<00:01:10.409> locked<00:01:10.650> on<00:01:10.950> there<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.580> i'm<00:01:11.850> going<00:01:12.150> to

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
got it locked on there and i'm going to

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.510 
got it locked on there and i'm going to
do<00:01:12.450> just<00:01:12.479> what<00:01:13.290> we<00:01:13.470> normally<00:01:13.710> do<00:01:14.100> with<00:01:14.280> wire

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
do just what we normally do with wire

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.060 
do just what we normally do with wire
wrapping<00:01:14.820> you're<00:01:15.119> going<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.299> pick<00:01:15.509> up<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.750> bead

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
wrapping you're going to pick up a bead

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.190 
wrapping you're going to pick up a bead
thread<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.220> through<00:01:17.330> and<00:01:18.330> you're<00:01:18.570> using<00:01:18.720> four

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
thread it through and you're using four

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.840 
thread it through and you're using four
millimeter<00:01:19.650> crystal<00:01:20.159> making<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.520> four

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
millimeter crystal making a four

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.969 
millimeter crystal making a four
millimeter<00:01:21.030> crystal<00:01:21.810> this<00:01:21.930> is<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.290> new<00:01:22.530> color

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
millimeter crystal this is the new color

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.359

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.170 
fern and i just love the way fern just
really<00:01:26.610> pops<00:01:26.909> against<00:01:27.450> gold<00:01:27.750> so<00:01:28.619> I'm

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
really pops against gold so I'm

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.310 
really pops against gold so I'm
threading<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.270> through<00:01:30.299> there<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.020> then<00:01:31.200> I'm

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
threading it through there and then I'm

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.200 
threading it through there and then I'm
threading<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.799> through<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.130> next<00:01:32.340> area<00:01:32.759> and

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
threading it through the next area and

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.060 
threading it through the next area and
I'm<00:01:33.600> just<00:01:33.810> pulling<00:01:34.110> tight<00:01:34.380> on<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:34.740> I<00:01:34.860> don't

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
I'm just pulling tight on it I don't

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.800 
I'm just pulling tight on it I don't
want<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.310> pull<00:01:35.520> too<00:01:35.820> tight<00:01:35.850> because<00:01:36.360> I<00:01:36.600> could

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
want to pull too tight because I could

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.830 
want to pull too tight because I could
snap<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.409> wire<00:01:37.619> now<00:01:37.979> I<00:01:38.729> like<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.360> work<00:01:39.570> in<00:01:39.720> a

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
keep that wire clean at the end so I'm

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.120 
keep that wire clean at the end so I'm
cutting<00:01:54.630> off<00:01:54.899> that<00:01:55.079> little<00:01:55.259> burr<00:01:55.590> at<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:55.979> end

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
here and I'm positioning it in putting

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.190 
here and I'm positioning it in putting
it<00:02:04.409> into<00:02:04.710> that<00:02:05.009> little<00:02:05.219> spoke<00:02:05.729> again<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.360> I'm

just coming up right next to it and you

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.669 
just coming up right next to it and you
don't<00:02:08.849> really<00:02:09.090> have<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.390> pay<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:09.989> lot<00:02:10.259> of<00:02:10.379> time

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
don't really have to pay a lot of time

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.840 
don't really have to pay a lot of time
and<00:02:10.979> attention<00:02:11.520> on<00:02:11.910> it<00:02:12.120> so<00:02:12.870> look<00:02:13.140> it's<00:02:13.349> all

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
and attention on it so look it's all

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.340 
and attention on it so look it's all
ready<00:02:13.940> there<00:02:14.240> I'm<00:02:14.450> just<00:02:14.660> going<00:02:14.840> to<00:02:14.900> pull<00:02:15.140> back

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
ready there I'm just going to pull back

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.830 
ready there I'm just going to pull back
against<00:02:15.920> it<00:02:16.100> and<00:02:16.250> I'm<00:02:17.030> going<00:02:17.180> to<00:02:17.210> thread<00:02:17.630> and

against it and I'm going to thread and

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.890 
against it and I'm going to thread and
basically<00:02:18.560> I'm<00:02:18.830> weaving<00:02:19.610> or<00:02:20.270> wire<00:02:20.540> wrapping

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
basically I'm weaving or wire wrapping

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.290 
basically I'm weaving or wire wrapping
against<00:02:21.500> it<00:02:21.650> but<00:02:21.800> it<00:02:21.950> disappears<00:02:22.730> on<00:02:23.000> to<00:02:23.210> the

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
against it but it disappears on to the

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.060 
against it but it disappears on to the
gold<00:02:23.510> piece<00:02:23.840> you<00:02:24.200> dad<00:02:24.410> because<00:02:24.710> you're<00:02:24.860> using

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
gold piece you dad because you're using

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.280 
gold piece you dad because you're using
that<00:02:25.370> thin<00:02:25.670> gauge<00:02:25.910> of<00:02:26.090> wire<00:02:26.150> and<00:02:26.630> yeah<00:02:26.930> you

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
that thin gauge of wire and yeah you

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.020 
that thin gauge of wire and yeah you
know<00:02:27.320> this<00:02:27.650> would<00:02:27.890> be<00:02:28.040> so<00:02:28.250> gorgeous<00:02:28.670> with<00:02:28.790> any

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
know this would be so gorgeous with any

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.510 
know this would be so gorgeous with any
different<00:02:29.480> pattern<00:02:29.930> and<00:02:30.140> these<00:02:30.830> taken<00:02:31.340> from

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
different pattern and these taken from

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.340 
different pattern and these taken from
lace<00:02:31.700> that<00:02:32.090> have<00:02:32.300> that<00:02:32.510> filigree<00:02:32.840> look<00:02:33.170> where

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
lace that have that filigree look where

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:34.630 
lace that have that filigree look where
you're<00:02:33.470> kind<00:02:33.620> of<00:02:33.740> filling<00:02:34.100> in<00:02:34.190> the<00:02:34.310> negative

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
you're kind of filling in the negative

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.820 
you're kind of filling in the negative
space<00:02:34.760> and<00:02:35.240> you<00:02:35.570> know<00:02:35.660> what's<00:02:35.870> been<00:02:36.110> fun<00:02:36.440> it's

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
space and you know what's been fun it's

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.380 
space and you know what's been fun it's
just<00:02:37.160> you<00:02:37.370> you<00:02:37.550> know<00:02:37.670> you<00:02:37.700> there's<00:02:38.150> so<00:02:38.300> many

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
just you you know you there's so many

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.330 
just you you know you there's so many
different<00:02:38.540> crystal<00:02:39.140> colors<00:02:39.500> and<00:02:39.710> you<00:02:39.860> keep<00:02:40.100> on

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
different crystal colors and you keep on

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.580 
different crystal colors and you keep on
playing<00:02:40.880> with<00:02:41.150> the<00:02:41.270> different<00:02:41.630> varieties<00:02:41.810> and

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
playing with the different varieties and

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.280 
playing with the different varieties and
you<00:02:43.160> find<00:02:43.430> all<00:02:43.610> different<00:02:44.180> ways<00:02:44.510> to<00:02:44.840> work<00:02:45.050> it

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
you find all different ways to work it

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.020 
you find all different ways to work it
so<00:02:45.500> now<00:02:45.650> that<00:02:45.860> I've<00:02:45.950> come<00:02:46.190> to<00:02:46.370> this<00:02:46.490> other<00:02:46.760> side

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
so now that I've come to this other side

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.960 
so now that I've come to this other side
I<00:02:47.330> want<00:02:47.840> to<00:02:47.900> come<00:02:48.110> back<00:02:48.290> and<00:02:48.590> do<00:02:48.950> this<00:02:49.520> bottom

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
I want to come back and do this bottom

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.090 
I want to come back and do this bottom
piece<00:02:50.150> because<00:02:50.450> I<00:02:50.600> don't<00:02:50.990> like<00:02:51.170> to<00:02:51.230> stop<00:02:51.860> and

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
piece because I don't like to stop and

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.790 
piece because I don't like to stop and
start<00:02:52.460> with<00:02:52.730> cutting<00:02:53.210> and<00:02:53.390> wrapping<00:02:53.780> on<00:02:53.960> so<00:02:54.710> I

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
start with cutting and wrapping on so I

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.130 
start with cutting and wrapping on so I
interesting<00:02:55.340> in<00:02:55.430> a<00:02:55.520> pattern<00:02:55.820> yep<00:02:56.630> and<00:02:56.840> so

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
interesting in a pattern yep and so

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.050 
interesting in a pattern yep and so
that's<00:02:57.620> why<00:02:57.830> I<00:02:57.890> have<00:02:58.040> my<00:02:58.070> crystals<00:02:58.610> laid<00:02:58.850> out

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
that's why I have my crystals laid out

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.820 
that's why I have my crystals laid out
to<00:02:59.300> have<00:02:59.450> the<00:02:59.660> four<00:02:59.900> millimeter<00:03:00.320> in<00:03:00.470> the<00:03:00.560> six

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
to have the four millimeter in the six

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.950 
to have the four millimeter in the six
millimeter<00:03:01.310> and<00:03:01.580> so<00:03:02.120> now<00:03:02.300> I'm<00:03:02.450> just<00:03:02.630> coming

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:02.960 
millimeter and so now I'm just coming

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.200 
millimeter and so now I'm just coming
back<00:03:03.110> into<00:03:03.530> that<00:03:03.680> section<00:03:04.040> there<00:03:04.520> and<00:03:04.760> I'm

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.210 
back into that section there and I'm

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:06.550 
back into that section there and I'm
going<00:03:05.390> to<00:03:05.420> do<00:03:05.570> the<00:03:05.690> same<00:03:05.870> thing<00:03:06.110> like<00:03:06.260> i<00:03:06.380> did<00:03:06.530> in

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
going to do the same thing like i did in

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.930 
going to do the same thing like i did in
the<00:03:06.680> beginning<00:03:06.860> i'm<00:03:07.250> going<00:03:07.400> to<00:03:07.460> go<00:03:07.610> into<00:03:07.790> that

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
little you know grip against yeah pieces

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.840 
little you know grip against yeah pieces
no<00:03:18.080> is<00:03:18.350> it<00:03:18.380> is<00:03:19.010> there<00:03:19.160> anything<00:03:19.310> important<00:03:19.790> to
