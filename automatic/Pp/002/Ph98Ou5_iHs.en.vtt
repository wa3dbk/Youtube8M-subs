simple just like the heroic and normal
version<00:00:13.730> there<00:00:14.730> are<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:14.880> few<00:00:15.030> new<00:00:15.299> mechanics

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
version there are a few new mechanics

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.480 
version there are a few new mechanics
but<00:00:16.199> believe<00:00:16.470> it<00:00:16.560> or<00:00:16.619> not<00:00:16.740> most<00:00:16.949> of<00:00:17.130> them<00:00:17.250> do

but believe it or not most of them do

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.349 
but believe it or not most of them do
not<00:00:17.640> involve<00:00:18.000> tanks<00:00:18.740> so<00:00:19.850> while<00:00:20.850> you<00:00:21.029> can

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
not involve tanks so while you can

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.640 
not involve tanks so while you can
somewhat<00:00:22.260> help<00:00:22.529> with<00:00:22.680> them<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:24.650> moderately

which is in the form of an alternate
energy<00:00:43.739> bar<00:00:44.070> you<00:00:44.219> can<00:00:44.370> see<00:00:44.489> an<00:00:44.579> example<00:00:44.610> in<00:00:45.059> the

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
energy bar you can see an example in the

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.490 
energy bar you can see an example in the

what extra sort of utility you can for

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.310 
what extra sort of utility you can for
your<00:01:11.070> particular<00:01:11.310> class<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:12.689> help<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:13.140> raid

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
your particular class to help the raid

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.469 
your particular class to help the raid
as<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.650> handle<00:01:14.070> these<00:01:14.159> mechanics<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.850> increase

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
as a handle these mechanics and increase

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.090 
as a handle these mechanics and increase
that<00:01:15.659> but<00:01:16.170> it's<00:01:16.590> just<00:01:16.710> something<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:16.979> be<00:01:17.040> aware

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
that but it's just something to be aware

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.179 
that but it's just something to be aware
of<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.759> why<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.780> strategies<00:01:19.530> in<00:01:19.740> positioning

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
of and why the strategies in positioning

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.950 
of and why the strategies in positioning
particular<00:01:20.700> will<00:01:21.330> change<00:01:21.600> throughout<00:01:21.840> the

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
particular will change throughout the

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.630 
particular will change throughout the
fight<00:01:24.650> probably<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.740> most<00:01:25.890> common<00:01:26.100> technique

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
fight probably the most common technique

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.170 
fight probably the most common technique
for<00:01:27.240> increasing<00:01:28.229> this<00:01:28.380> is<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.829> kite<00:01:29.130> car<00:01:30.000> gas

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
for increasing this is to kite car gas

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.020 
for increasing this is to kite car gas
during<00:01:30.479> his<00:01:30.689> Berserker<00:01:31.140> rush<00:01:31.430> so<00:01:32.430> obviously

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
during his Berserker rush so obviously

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.910 
during his Berserker rush so obviously
if<00:01:33.450> you're<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.810> tank<00:01:34.049> that's<00:01:34.290> on<00:01:34.409> carga<00:01:34.710> the

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
if you're the tank that's on carga the

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.219 
if you're the tank that's on carga the
time<00:01:35.189> you<00:01:36.180> just<00:01:36.329> need<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.600> stand<00:01:36.810> behind<00:01:36.960> him

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
time you just need to stand behind him

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.370 
time you just need to stand behind him
so<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:37.470> don't<00:01:37.619> get<00:01:37.740> rest<00:01:38.009> yourself<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:39.380> if

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
so you don't get rest yourself and if

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.620 
so you don't get rest yourself and if
you<00:01:40.979> have<00:01:41.250> any<00:01:41.280> utility<00:01:41.909> benefit<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.509> the

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
you have any utility benefit to the

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.899 
you have any utility benefit to the
player<00:01:42.810> that's<00:01:43.049> kiting<00:01:43.439> or<00:01:43.729> tanking<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.820> the

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
player that's kiting or tanking to the

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.370 
player that's kiting or tanking to the
time<00:01:45.090> with<00:01:45.240> raising<00:01:45.509> cooldowns<00:01:45.869> you<00:01:46.079> can<00:01:46.259> add

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
time with raising cooldowns you can add

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.760 
time with raising cooldowns you can add
that<00:01:46.590> so<00:01:46.829> for<00:01:46.979> example<00:01:47.009> paladin's<00:01:47.990> if<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.320> can

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
that so for example paladin's if you can

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.440 
that so for example paladin's if you can
use<00:01:50.040> hannah<00:01:50.250> protection<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:51.000> last<00:01:51.180> 10

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
use hannah protection the last 10

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.410 
use hannah protection the last 10
seconds<00:01:51.899> of<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.880> Berserker<00:01:53.880> rush<00:01:54.090> on<00:01:54.360> that

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
seconds of the Berserker rush on that

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.170 
seconds of the Berserker rush on that
particular<00:01:54.960> targeted<00:01:55.560> player<00:01:55.770> they<00:01:56.640> can<00:01:56.939> just

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
particular targeted player they can just

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.399 
particular targeted player they can just
stand<00:01:57.329> there<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.570> eat<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.079> they'll<00:01:58.259> be

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
stand there and eat it and they'll be

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:19.099 
didn't take that many attempts is to

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:22.240 
didn't take that many attempts is to
always<00:05:19.310> leave<00:05:19.580> one<00:05:19.639> fire<00:05:20.419> pillar<00:05:20.719> active<00:05:21.590> and

always leave one fire pillar active and

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:25.119 
always leave one fire pillar active and
sort<00:05:22.520> of<00:05:22.610> ready<00:05:22.759> to<00:05:22.879> go<00:05:23.830> exception<00:05:24.830> is<00:05:24.919> if<00:05:24.949> you

00:05:25.119 --> 00:05:25.129 
sort of ready to go exception is if you

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:27.790 
sort of ready to go exception is if you
know<00:05:25.460> for<00:05:25.879> a<00:05:25.909> fact<00:05:26.120> that<00:05:27.080> nothing<00:05:27.500> will

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
know for a fact that nothing will

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.730 
know for a fact that nothing will
require<00:05:28.159> your<00:05:28.370> use<00:05:28.550> of<00:05:28.580> it<00:05:28.879> for<00:05:29.240> a<00:05:29.270> long<00:05:29.419> time

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 
require your use of it for a long time

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.050 
require your use of it for a long time
so<00:05:30.740> the<00:05:30.860> two<00:05:30.979> things<00:05:31.219> that<00:05:31.310> require<00:05:31.759> fire

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.060 
so the two things that require fire

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.779 
so the two things that require fire
pillar<00:05:32.330> usage<00:05:32.810> are<00:05:33.080> if<00:05:33.949> you're<00:05:34.430> kiting

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:34.789 
pillar usage are if you're kiting

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:36.399 
pillar usage are if you're kiting
berserker<00:05:35.120> rush<00:05:35.360> into<00:05:35.599> it<00:05:35.870> just<00:05:36.110> like<00:05:36.229> you

00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:36.409 
berserker rush into it just like you

that<00:05:39.319> player<00:05:39.440> will<00:05:39.650> need<00:05:39.800> to<00:05:39.889> make<00:05:40.039> use<00:05:40.219> of<00:05:40.250> it

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460 
that player will need to make use of it

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.570 
that player will need to make use of it
or<00:05:40.819> if<00:05:41.569> a<00:05:41.870> tiger<00:05:42.379> is<00:05:42.589> active<00:05:43.069> or<00:05:43.159> about<00:05:43.370> to

case but if neither of those are true or

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:53.529 
case but if neither of those are true or
you<00:05:51.860> know<00:05:52.069> it's<00:05:52.219> going<00:05:52.370> to<00:05:52.460> be<00:05:52.520> a<00:05:52.550> delay<00:05:52.879> quite

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:53.539 
you know it's going to be a delay quite

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:55.390 
you know it's going to be a delay quite
a<00:05:53.569> while<00:05:53.629> and<00:05:54.080> another<00:05:54.319> pillar<00:05:54.919> will<00:05:55.159> spawn

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 
a while and another pillar will spawn

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.820 
a while and another pillar will spawn
then<00:05:56.360> you<00:05:56.599> should<00:05:56.810> quickly<00:05:57.139> pull<00:05:57.469> the<00:05:57.589> tank

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:57.830 
then you should quickly pull the tank

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.219 
then you should quickly pull the tank
into<00:05:58.129> an<00:05:58.699> existing<00:05:58.879> pillar<00:05:59.270> and<00:05:59.569> when<00:06:00.020> you<00:06:00.080> do

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:00.229 
into an existing pillar and when you do

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:03.309 
into an existing pillar and when you do
so<00:06:00.409> you<00:06:00.439> try<00:06:00.860> to<00:06:01.089> pull<00:06:02.089> it<00:06:02.210> into<00:06:02.360> the<00:06:02.719> newest

00:06:03.309 --> 00:06:03.319 
so you try to pull it into the newest

00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:06.219 
so you try to pull it into the newest
pillar<00:06:03.740> that<00:06:03.949> spawn<00:06:04.189> the<00:06:05.089> freshest<00:06:05.539> one<00:06:06.110> that

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:06.229 
pillar that spawn the freshest one that

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:08.589 
pillar that spawn the freshest one that
appeared<00:06:06.529> because<00:06:06.819> the<00:06:07.819> pillars<00:06:08.089> themselves

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:08.599 
appeared because the pillars themselves

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:11.379 
appeared because the pillars themselves
have<00:06:08.810> a<00:06:08.839> set<00:06:09.620> duration<00:06:09.800> there<00:06:10.759> remain<00:06:11.000> active

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:11.389 
have a set duration there remain active

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:12.969 
have a set duration there remain active
for<00:06:11.419> a<00:06:11.599> certain<00:06:11.900> period<00:06:12.080> before<00:06:12.379> they<00:06:12.620> go<00:06:12.770> away

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:12.979 
for a certain period before they go away

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:15.369 
for a certain period before they go away
so<00:06:13.969> getting<00:06:14.360> the<00:06:14.509> new<00:06:14.629> one<00:06:14.810> is<00:06:14.930> just<00:06:15.050> more

00:06:15.369 --> 00:06:15.379 
so getting the new one is just more

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:17.320 
so getting the new one is just more
efficient<00:06:15.830> you're<00:06:16.339> basically<00:06:16.550> using<00:06:16.789> that

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:17.330 
efficient you're basically using that

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.709 
efficient you're basically using that
pseudo<00:06:18.639> removal<00:06:19.639> ability<00:06:20.240> of<00:06:20.360> getting<00:06:20.569> rid<00:06:20.689> of

00:06:20.709 --> 00:06:20.719 
pseudo removal ability of getting rid of

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:22.089 
pseudo removal ability of getting rid of
the<00:06:20.839> pillar<00:06:21.020> by<00:06:21.229> running<00:06:21.469> the<00:06:21.529> boss<00:06:21.680> into<00:06:21.979> it

00:06:22.089 --> 00:06:22.099 
the pillar by running the boss into it

00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:24.610 
the pillar by running the boss into it
on<00:06:22.250> the<00:06:23.240> newest<00:06:23.629> one<00:06:23.839> so<00:06:24.199> that's<00:06:24.349> the<00:06:24.500> most

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:24.620 
on the newest one so that's the most

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.329 
on the newest one so that's the most
efficient<00:06:25.009> way<00:06:25.069> to<00:06:25.129> do<00:06:25.310> it<00:06:25.990> so<00:06:26.990> I<00:06:27.259> can't<00:06:28.159> offer

00:06:28.329 --> 00:06:28.339 
efficient way to do it so I can't offer

00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:30.369 
efficient way to do it so I can't offer
like<00:06:28.669> a<00:06:28.699> step<00:06:29.089> by<00:06:29.210> step<00:06:29.449> you<00:06:29.689> know<00:06:29.900> this<00:06:30.139> pillar

00:06:30.369 --> 00:06:30.379 
like a step by step you know this pillar

00:06:30.379 --> 00:06:31.570 
like a step by step you know this pillar
you<00:06:30.560> can<00:06:30.650> get<00:06:30.770> rid<00:06:30.860> of<00:06:30.949> this<00:06:31.069> one<00:06:31.250> you<00:06:31.370> have<00:06:31.490> to

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:31.580 
you can get rid of this one you have to

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.120 
you can get rid of this one you have to
skip<00:06:31.849> because<00:06:32.180> it's<00:06:32.990> dynamic<00:06:33.589> it's<00:06:33.740> based<00:06:33.949> on

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:34.130 
skip because it's dynamic it's based on

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:36.879 
skip because it's dynamic it's based on

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:36.889 
the randomness of how the encounter goes

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:38.530 
the randomness of how the encounter goes
for<00:06:37.039> your<00:06:37.099> particular<00:06:37.339> raid

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:38.540 
for your particular raid

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.180 
for your particular raid
how<00:06:38.810> you<00:06:38.870> handle<00:06:39.350> the<00:06:39.380> cutting<00:06:39.800> how<00:06:40.130> you

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:40.190 
how you handle the cutting how you

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:42.010 
how you handle the cutting how you
handle<00:06:40.460> the<00:06:40.490> Tigers<00:06:40.940> all<00:06:41.090> that<00:06:41.210> stuff<00:06:41.450> but

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:42.020 
handle the Tigers all that stuff but

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:43.420 
handle the Tigers all that stuff but
like<00:06:42.080> I<00:06:42.200> said<00:06:42.320> the<00:06:42.410> general<00:06:42.650> of<00:06:42.950> thumb<00:06:43.190> is

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:43.430 
like I said the general of thumb is

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.720 
like I said the general of thumb is
leave<00:06:44.390> one<00:06:44.690> get<00:06:45.200> rid<00:06:45.350> of<00:06:45.380> the<00:06:45.560> extra<00:06:45.830> and<00:06:46.460> if

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:46.730 
leave one get rid of the extra and if

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:48.400 
leave one get rid of the extra and if
you<00:06:46.820> do<00:06:46.970> that<00:06:47.000> overall<00:06:47.750> you<00:06:47.900> should<00:06:48.110> be<00:06:48.260> good

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:48.410 
you do that overall you should be good

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:50.980 
you do that overall you should be good
outside<00:06:48.950> of<00:06:49.060> particular<00:06:50.060> nuances<00:06:50.570> for<00:06:50.810> your
