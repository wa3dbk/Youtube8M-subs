00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:20.710 

car<00:00:05.970> is<00:00:06.180> not<00:00:06.420> running<00:00:06.690> right<00:00:06.870> now<00:00:08.719> ignition<00:00:09.719> on

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.940 

Carr<00:00:21.289> is<00:00:21.410> obviously<00:00:21.830> running<00:00:22.100> now

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:25.950 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.109 

I'm<00:00:26.950> rubbing<00:00:27.130> the<00:00:27.310> motor<00:00:27.520> up<00:00:27.700> a<00:00:27.790> little<00:00:27.940> bit

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:28.119 
I'm rubbing the motor up a little bit

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.729 
I'm rubbing the motor up a little bit
here<00:00:28.360> and<00:00:28.420> there<00:00:29.250> so<00:00:30.250> what<00:00:30.460> was<00:00:30.610> happening<00:00:31.739> and

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:32.739 
here and there so what was happening and

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:41.040 
here and there so what was happening and
why<00:00:33.340> I<00:00:34.470> am<00:00:35.470> doing<00:00:35.860> this<00:00:36.010> here<00:00:36.340> is<00:00:36.489> uh<00:00:39.989> on<00:00:40.989> the

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
why I am doing this here is uh on the

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.200 
why I am doing this here is uh on the
highway<00:00:41.590> the<00:00:41.830> oil<00:00:42.010> gauge<00:00:42.280> is<00:00:42.460> fluctuating<00:00:42.940> up

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
highway the oil gauge is fluctuating up

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.820 
highway the oil gauge is fluctuating up
and<00:00:43.360> down<00:00:43.480> fairly<00:00:43.989> erratically<00:00:45.330> in<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:47.590> high

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:47.830 
and down fairly erratically in the high

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.670 
and down fairly erratically in the high
range<00:00:48.190> like<00:00:48.670> sixty<00:00:49.270> to<00:00:49.420> eighty<00:00:49.690> in<00:00:50.050> even<00:00:50.410> past

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
range like sixty to eighty in even past

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.200 
range like sixty to eighty in even past
eighty<00:00:51.010> a<00:00:51.100> little<00:00:51.370> bit<00:00:51.489> even<00:00:51.790> towards<00:00:52.059> the

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
eighty a little bit even towards the

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.650 
eighty a little bit even towards the
screw<00:00:52.629> on<00:00:52.900> the<00:00:52.989> oil<00:00:53.500> pressure<00:00:53.830> gauge<00:00:53.949> there<00:00:54.660> so

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:55.660 
screw on the oil pressure gauge there so

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.570 
screw on the oil pressure gauge there so
I<00:00:55.690> googled<00:00:55.930> it<00:00:56.320> real<00:00:56.530> quick<00:00:56.769> and<00:00:59.370> found<00:01:00.370> out

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:00.580 
I googled it real quick and found out

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.610 
I googled it real quick and found out
that<00:01:00.610> the<00:01:01.570> oil<00:01:01.809> pressure<00:01:02.110> sending<00:01:02.500> unit<00:01:04.620> goes

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:05.620 
that the oil pressure sending unit goes

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.070 
that the oil pressure sending unit goes
bad<00:01:05.979> often<00:01:06.490> on<00:01:06.670> Jeeps<00:01:07.210> I<00:01:07.360> guess<00:01:07.570> it's<00:01:07.750> a<00:01:07.840> fairly

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
bad often on Jeeps I guess it's a fairly

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.639 
bad often on Jeeps I guess it's a fairly
common<00:01:08.530> problem<00:01:09.600> so

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:13.649 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:16.139 

if<00:01:14.649> you<00:01:14.799> can<00:01:14.979> I'm<00:01:15.310> trying<00:01:15.610> to<00:01:15.700> drive<00:01:15.850> and<00:01:16.060> do

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:16.149 
if you can I'm trying to drive and do

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:18.240 
if you can I'm trying to drive and do
this<00:01:16.240> at<00:01:16.420> the<00:01:16.509> same<00:01:16.630> time<00:01:16.899> but<00:01:17.110> if<00:01:17.649> you<00:01:17.799> have<00:01:18.219> a

this at the same time but if you have a

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.749 
this at the same time but if you have a
similar<00:01:18.610> problem<00:01:19.200> go<00:01:20.200> ahead<00:01:20.259> and<00:01:20.469> comment<00:01:20.710> or

you<00:01:24.759> know<00:01:24.880> I'm<00:01:25.030> gonna<00:01:25.180> take<00:01:25.479> this<00:01:25.600> home<00:01:25.810> and

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 
you know I'm gonna take this home and

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:32.249 
you know I'm gonna take this home and
I'm<00:01:26.439> gonna<00:01:26.619> try<00:01:26.950> and<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:30.340> know<00:01:30.490> put<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.990> gauge

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
I'm gonna try and you know put the gauge

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:35.149 
I'm gonna try and you know put the gauge
in<00:01:32.560> and<00:01:32.860> see<00:01:33.130> if<00:01:33.189> that's<00:01:33.399> actually<00:01:33.579> the<00:01:33.850> deal

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
in and see if that's actually the deal

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.590 
in and see if that's actually the deal
see<00:01:36.159> how<00:01:36.310> ironic<00:01:36.729> it<00:01:36.880> is<00:01:36.970> I<00:01:37.210> mean<00:01:37.360> it's<00:01:37.539> just

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
see how ironic it is I mean it's just

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.840 
see how ironic it is I mean it's just
not<00:01:37.750> it's<00:01:38.170> just<00:01:38.319> not<00:01:38.470> very<00:01:38.500> normal<00:01:39.100> and<00:01:39.280> on<00:01:39.729> the

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
not it's just not very normal and on the

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.910 
not it's just not very normal and on the
highway<00:01:40.210> when<00:01:40.450> you're<00:01:40.840> at<00:01:40.960> like<00:01:41.289> a<00:01:41.350> constant

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
highway when you're at like a constant

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.340 
highway when you're at like a constant
cruising<00:01:42.340> speed<00:01:42.610> it<00:01:43.450> just<00:01:43.659> like<00:01:43.810> goes<00:01:43.990> up<00:01:44.200> and

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
cruising speed it just like goes up and

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:45.630 
cruising speed it just like goes up and
down<00:01:44.380> up<00:01:44.470> and<00:01:44.770> down<00:01:44.799> up<00:01:44.890> and<00:01:45.189> down<00:01:45.220> and<00:01:45.549> then

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
down up and down up and down and then

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.820 
down up and down up and down and then
like<00:01:45.849> it's<00:01:46.390> just<00:01:46.539> high<00:01:46.810> I<00:01:47.170> mean<00:01:47.349> look<00:01:47.500> how<00:01:47.560> high

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
like it's just high I mean look how high

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.440 
like it's just high I mean look how high
that<00:01:47.860> is<00:01:48.069> great<00:01:48.580> I've<00:01:48.729> never<00:01:48.909> seen<00:01:49.179> anything

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
that is great I've never seen anything

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.660 
that is great I've never seen anything
like<00:01:49.599> that<00:01:49.780> high<00:01:50.020> like<00:01:50.289> that<00:01:50.700> so<00:01:52.049> I<00:01:53.340> did<00:01:54.340> smell

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
like that high like that so I did smell

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.490 
like that high like that so I did smell
a<00:01:54.700> faint<00:01:55.090> electrical<00:01:55.599> like<00:01:56.020> burning<00:01:56.409> smell

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
a faint electrical like burning smell

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.690 
a faint electrical like burning smell
but<00:01:59.500> it<00:01:59.590> was<00:01:59.709> brief<00:02:00.009> and<00:02:00.250> I<00:02:00.310> wasn't<00:02:00.490> exactly

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
but it was brief and I wasn't exactly

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.490 
but it was brief and I wasn't exactly
sure<00:02:01.149> if<00:02:01.270> it<00:02:01.360> was<00:02:01.450> coming<00:02:01.599> from<00:02:01.810> my<00:02:01.899> car<00:02:02.259> or

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
don't know I'm gonna give the oil

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.319 
don't know I'm gonna give the oil
pressure<00:02:08.920> sending<00:02:09.250> thing<00:02:09.579> in<00:02:09.729> a<00:02:09.819> shop<00:02:10.090> and

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:10.329 
pressure sending thing in a shop and

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:14.940 
pressure sending thing in a shop and
then<00:02:10.840> see<00:02:11.049> what<00:02:11.200> happens<00:02:11.620> and<00:02:13.709> yeah<00:02:14.709> if
