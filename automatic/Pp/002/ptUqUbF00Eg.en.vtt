the bottom two it's fine
the<00:00:18.829> top<00:00:19.070> one<00:00:19.340> and<00:00:19.640> still<00:00:19.939> install<00:00:20.329> it<00:00:20.509> but<00:00:20.689> you

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:21.259 
the top one and still install it but you

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:23.260 
the top one and still install it but you
drove<00:00:21.439> the<00:00:21.649> top<00:00:21.860> two<00:00:22.070> are<00:00:22.189> missing<00:00:22.640> and<00:00:23.149> then

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:23.270 
drove the top two are missing and then

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.080 
drove the top two are missing and then
you<00:00:23.419> install<00:00:23.720> them<00:00:24.550> then<00:00:25.550> you<00:00:25.669> install<00:00:25.970> the

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.090 
you install them then you install the

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.749 
you install them then you install the
top<00:00:26.300> two<00:00:26.570> at<00:00:26.960> the<00:00:27.349> end<00:00:27.380> a<00:00:27.680> good<00:00:28.040> place<00:00:28.369> to<00:00:28.399> put<00:00:28.669> a

top two at the end a good place to put a
little<00:00:28.939> bit<00:00:29.029> of<00:00:29.180> a<00:00:29.210> heat<00:00:29.660> tape<00:00:29.899> is<00:00:30.079> right<00:00:30.290> here

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.210 
little bit of a heat tape is right here

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:37.210 
little bit of a heat tape is right here
the<00:00:32.210> pipes<00:00:32.480> can<00:00:32.689> come<00:00:32.989> you<00:00:33.580> know<00:00:34.580> when<00:00:36.220> usually

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:37.220 
the pipes can come you know when usually

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.890 
the pipes can come you know when usually
a<00:00:37.430> quarter<00:00:37.640> inch<00:00:37.940> but<00:00:38.240> they<00:00:38.360> can<00:00:38.510> be<00:00:38.660> closed

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:38.900 
a quarter inch but they can be closed

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.440 
a quarter inch but they can be closed
for<00:00:39.140> some<00:00:39.320> time<00:00:39.560> and<00:00:40.090> it's<00:00:41.090> just<00:00:41.210> better<00:00:41.390> if

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450 
for some time and it's just better if

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.200 
for some time and it's just better if
you<00:00:41.570> put<00:00:41.750> a<00:00:41.780> little<00:00:41.900> heat<00:00:42.080> tape<00:00:43.000> other<00:00:44.000> than

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
you put a little heat tape other than

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.190 
you put a little heat tape other than
that<00:00:46.180> we're<00:00:47.180> pretty<00:00:47.329> much<00:00:47.480> good<00:00:47.780> to<00:00:47.810> go<00:00:47.960> to

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:48.200 
that we're pretty much good to go to

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
install the muffler once you build that

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.520 
install the muffler once you build that
back<00:00:52.550> up<00:00:52.610> you<00:00:53.030> put<00:00:53.210> back<00:00:53.420> the<00:00:53.600> heat<00:00:54.050> seal<00:00:54.350> that

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
back up you put back the heat seal that

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.370 
back up you put back the heat seal that
was<00:00:54.650> there<00:00:55.360> then<00:00:56.360> you<00:00:56.570> get<00:00:56.720> to<00:00:56.810> go<00:00:56.870> to<00:00:56.960> install

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:57.380 
was there then you get to go to install

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.569 
was there then you get to go to install
the<00:00:57.950> muffler<00:00:58.280> itself<00:00:58.690> it's<00:00:59.690> gonna<00:00:59.810> go<00:00:59.989> here

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 
the muffler itself it's gonna go here

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:03.040 
the muffler itself it's gonna go here
before<00:01:01.579> you<00:01:01.640> actually<00:01:01.760> install<00:01:02.210> the<00:01:02.510> muffler

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 
before you actually install the muffler

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.109 
before you actually install the muffler
since<00:01:03.649> the<00:01:03.829> outlet<00:01:04.189> is<00:01:04.280> very<00:01:04.489> large<00:01:04.790> actually

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
since the outlet is very large actually

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:07.990 
since the outlet is very large actually
takes<00:01:05.449> a<00:01:05.570> whole<00:01:05.720> shape<00:01:06.079> here<00:01:06.620> okay<00:01:07.190> what<00:01:07.850> we

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
takes a whole shape here okay what we

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.890 
takes a whole shape here okay what we
did<00:01:08.240> for<00:01:09.140> best<00:01:09.409> fit<00:01:09.710> is<00:01:09.950> to<00:01:10.640> grind<00:01:10.940> off<00:01:11.150> or<00:01:11.450> just

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
did for best fit is to grind off or just

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.850 
did for best fit is to grind off or just
cut<00:01:12.140> off<00:01:12.320> that<00:01:12.350> rubber<00:01:13.070> part<00:01:13.850> and<00:01:14.710> towards<00:01:15.710> the

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
cut off that rubber part and towards the

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.789 
cut off that rubber part and towards the
front<00:01:16.159> not<00:01:16.340> the<00:01:16.400> back<00:01:16.810> also<00:01:17.810> what<00:01:18.260> we<00:01:18.380> did<00:01:18.590> on

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
front not the back also what we did on

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:21.340 
front not the back also what we did on
our<00:01:19.159> on<00:01:19.549> our<00:01:19.760> machine<00:01:20.180> there<00:01:20.360> is<00:01:20.540> that<00:01:21.170> we

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
our on our machine there is that we

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:22.870 
our on our machine there is that we
actually<00:01:21.470> groan<00:01:21.890> off<00:01:22.070> a<00:01:22.100> little<00:01:22.580> bit<00:01:22.700> off<00:01:22.850> the

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
actually groan off a little bit off the

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.020 
actually groan off a little bit off the
aluminum<00:01:23.500> ring<00:01:24.500> so<00:01:25.070> it<00:01:25.340> gives<00:01:25.520> us<00:01:25.640> a<00:01:25.760> slight

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
aluminum ring so it gives us a slight

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.480 
aluminum ring so it gives us a slight
bit<00:01:26.180> more<00:01:26.390> clearance<00:01:26.710> but<00:01:27.710> you<00:01:27.830> don't<00:01:28.070> need<00:01:28.340> to

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
bit more clearance but you don't need to

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.219 
bit more clearance but you don't need to
do<00:01:28.640> that<00:01:28.670> absolutely<00:01:28.820> it<00:01:29.420> just<00:01:29.659> gives<00:01:29.840> an<00:01:30.110> even

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
do that absolutely it just gives an even

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.530 
do that absolutely it just gives an even
better<00:01:30.560> fit<00:01:30.920> or<00:01:31.130> you<00:01:31.340> saw<00:01:31.700> your<00:01:31.880> rubber<00:01:32.090> mounts

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
better fit or you saw your rubber mounts

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:49.920 
better fit or you saw your rubber mounts
here<00:01:32.780> and<00:01:34.090> you're<00:01:35.090> ready<00:01:35.510> to<00:01:35.600> install<00:01:35.840> it

okay you don't forget your stock co2

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.820 
okay you don't forget your stock co2
sensor<00:02:17.020> right<00:02:17.710> here<00:02:18.480> and<00:02:19.480> your<00:02:20.080> v-band<00:02:20.500> clamp

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
sensor right here and your v-band clamp

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.970 
sensor right here and your v-band clamp
you<00:02:21.430> tighten<00:02:21.820> it<00:02:21.880> make<00:02:22.150> sure<00:02:22.530> that<00:02:23.530> the<00:02:23.800> two

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
rings are well matched together before

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.380 
rings are well matched together before
tightening<00:02:27.670> it's<00:02:28.480> easy<00:02:28.690> mistake<00:02:28.990> to<00:02:29.230> make
