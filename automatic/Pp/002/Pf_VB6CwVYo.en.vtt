00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
sets of alignments and we were able to

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.910 
sets of alignments and we were able to
get<00:00:24.359> a<00:00:24.420> lot<00:00:24.510> of<00:00:24.660> good<00:00:24.810> quality<00:00:25.260> reps<00:00:25.500> in<00:00:25.680> there

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
and the more reps you get the better off

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.500 
and the more reps you get the better off
you<00:00:28.380> should<00:00:28.439> be<00:00:28.740> so<00:00:29.150> you<00:00:30.150> know<00:00:30.240> it's<00:00:30.390> really

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.640 
I think that will pay dividends once we
get<00:02:38.320> in<00:02:38.470> to<00:02:38.560> game<00:02:38.590> time<00:02:38.980> in<00:02:39.160> September
