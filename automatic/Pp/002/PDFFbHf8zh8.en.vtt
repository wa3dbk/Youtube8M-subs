00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
absolute beauty first thing to explain

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.280 
absolute beauty first thing to explain
is<00:00:30.200> a<00:00:30.230> time<00:00:30.560> signature<00:00:30.950> it's<00:00:31.730> in<00:00:31.910> 12-8<00:00:32.720> and<00:00:33.079> all

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 
is a time signature it's in 12-8 and all

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:34.720 
is a time signature it's in 12-8 and all
that<00:00:33.410> amazes<00:00:33.770> have<00:00:33.860> a<00:00:33.950> feeling<00:00:34.310> of<00:00:34.370> the<00:00:34.489> beats

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
that amazes have a feeling of the beats

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.520 
that amazes have a feeling of the beats
of<00:00:34.880> the<00:00:34.910> bar<00:00:35.180> in<00:00:35.420> groups<00:00:35.690> of<00:00:35.840> three<00:00:36.200> you<00:00:36.410> could

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
of the bar in groups of three you could

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.290 
of the bar in groups of three you could
think<00:00:36.680> of<00:00:36.800> it<00:00:36.920> it's<00:00:37.070> like<00:00:37.100> a<00:00:37.250> triplet<00:00:37.640> kind<00:00:38.120> of

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
think of it it's like a triplet kind of

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.510 
think of it it's like a triplet kind of
pulse<00:00:38.660> and<00:00:39.320> we're<00:00:39.530> counting<00:00:39.860> each<00:00:39.980> bar<00:00:40.280> has

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
pulse and we're counting each bar has

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.260 
pulse and we're counting each bar has
two<00:00:40.790> groups<00:00:41.060> of<00:00:41.210> 6<00:00:41.480> 1<00:00:41.810> 2<00:00:41.840> 3<00:00:42.020> 4<00:00:42.260> 5<00:00:42.680> 6<00:00:42.860> 1<00:00:43.100> 2<00:00:43.160> 3<00:00:43.340> 4<00:00:43.580> 5<00:00:44.030> 6

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
two groups of 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6

the<00:00:45.140> drum<00:00:45.350> fill<00:00:45.560> is<00:00:45.770> 2<00:00:46.070> bars<00:00:46.310> long<00:00:46.640> and<00:00:46.910> it

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:47.060 
the drum fill is 2 bars long and it

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.290 
the drum fill is 2 bars long and it
actually<00:00:47.360> starts<00:00:47.750> halfway<00:00:48.230> through<00:00:48.560> bar<00:00:49.070> 1<00:00:49.460> so

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
actually starts halfway through bar 1 so

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.550 
actually starts halfway through bar 1 so
we're<00:00:50.840> counting<00:00:51.020> 1<00:00:51.590> &amp;<00:00:51.800> 2<00:00:51.950> 3<00:00:52.280> 4<00:00:52.730> 5<00:00:53.030> 6<00:00:53.390> and<00:00:53.810> as<00:00:54.410> you

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:54.560 
we're counting 1 &amp; 2 3 4 5 6 and as you

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.140 
we're counting 1 &amp; 2 3 4 5 6 and as you
can<00:00:54.650> hear<00:00:54.710> from<00:00:54.980> that<00:00:55.130> we're<00:00:55.340> doubling<00:00:55.820> up<00:00:55.970> the

you'd have heard me talking about this
rudiment<00:01:56.530> quite<00:01:56.770> a<00:01:56.800> lot<00:01:57.130> I<00:01:57.250> mean<00:01:57.370> it<00:01:57.460> appears

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
rudiment quite a lot I mean it appears

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.750 
rudiment quite a lot I mean it appears
it<00:01:58.090> occurs<00:01:58.390> in<00:01:58.720> a<00:01:59.020> lot<00:01:59.290> of<00:01:59.470> really<00:02:00.280> cool<00:02:00.490> drum

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:00.760 
it occurs in a lot of really cool drum

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.460 
it occurs in a lot of really cool drum
fills<00:02:01.060> and<00:02:01.270> drum<00:02:01.450> groove<00:02:01.690> ideas<00:02:02.110> played<00:02:02.320> by

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
fills and drum groove ideas played by

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.070 
fills and drum groove ideas played by
some<00:02:02.650> really<00:02:02.860> great<00:02:03.160> drummers<00:02:03.640> so<00:02:04.360> it's<00:02:04.930> one

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
some really great drummers so it's one

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
some really great drummers so it's one
of<00:02:05.110> these<00:02:05.200> things<00:02:05.410> that<00:02:05.620> I<00:02:05.680> like<00:02:05.860> to<00:02:05.980> play

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
of these things that I like to play

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.710 
of these things that I like to play
because<00:02:06.520> it's<00:02:06.670> so<00:02:06.820> popular<00:02:07.330> because<00:02:07.450> it

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
because it's so popular because it

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.660 
because it's so popular because it
sounds<00:02:07.990> so<00:02:08.110> cool<00:02:08.350> and<00:02:09.190> it's<00:02:09.310> not<00:02:09.399> particularly

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
sounds so cool and it's not particularly

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.449 
sounds so cool and it's not particularly
complicated<00:02:10.030> it's<00:02:10.990> three<00:02:11.620> counted<00:02:12.220> beats

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
complicated it's three counted beats

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.130 
complicated it's three counted beats
long<00:02:12.700> and<00:02:12.970> we're<00:02:13.090> doubling<00:02:13.540> up<00:02:13.660> the<00:02:13.840> first

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
long and we're doubling up the first

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.550 
long and we're doubling up the first
beats<00:02:14.800> so<00:02:15.459> one<00:02:16.209> two<00:02:16.540> three<00:02:16.570> at<00:02:17.020> the<00:02:17.140> pulse<00:02:17.380> and

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
beats so one two three at the pulse and

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.260 
beats so one two three at the pulse and
we're<00:02:17.680> doubling<00:02:18.010> up<00:02:18.130> the<00:02:18.250> first<00:02:18.490> of<00:02:18.700> each<00:02:18.850> one

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
we're doubling up the first of each one

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:55.750 
we're doubling up the first of each one
and<00:02:19.570> two<00:02:22.530> played<00:02:23.530> notes<00:02:23.800> in<00:02:23.980> three<00:02:24.610> counted

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.010 

so<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:56.910> first<00:02:57.150> purchase<00:02:57.480> played<00:02:57.660> on<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:57.840> high
