hi my name is Sahira and welcome to my
online<00:00:02.970> belly<00:00:03.629> dance<00:00:03.870> studio<00:00:05.000> hi<00:00:06.000> there

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
online belly dance studio hi there

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.629 
online belly dance studio hi there
today's<00:00:06.960> focus<00:00:07.230> is<00:00:07.529> on<00:00:07.649> the<00:00:07.799> Joule<00:00:08.130> which<00:00:08.400> is<00:00:08.610> a

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
today's focus is on the Joule which is a

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.549 
today's focus is on the Joule which is a
little<00:00:08.970> accent<00:00:09.540> move<00:00:09.719> that<00:00:09.929> can<00:00:10.050> be<00:00:10.170> added

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
little accent move that can be added

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.499 
little accent move that can be added
into<00:00:10.710> a<00:00:10.889> lot<00:00:11.190> of<00:00:11.340> other<00:00:11.490> movements<00:00:12.059> so<00:00:12.389> we're

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
into a lot of other movements so we're

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:13.940 
into a lot of other movements so we're
going<00:00:12.599> to<00:00:12.690> break<00:00:12.900> down<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.139> movement<00:00:13.650> as<00:00:13.769> it

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
going to break down the movement as it

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.289 
going to break down the movement as it
is<00:00:14.099> and<00:00:14.370> then<00:00:14.460> we're<00:00:14.580> going<00:00:14.670> to<00:00:14.730> add<00:00:14.940> it<00:00:15.089> into

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
is and then we're going to add it into

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.720 
is and then we're going to add it into
both<00:00:15.630> our<00:00:15.900> hip<00:00:16.289> circle<00:00:16.740> and<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:17.520> our

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
both our hip circle and to our

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.790 
both our hip circle and to our
horizontal<00:00:18.240> figure<00:00:18.779> eight<00:00:18.930> so<00:00:19.439> if<00:00:19.500> you<00:00:19.619> don't

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
horizontal figure eight so if you don't

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.140 
horizontal figure eight so if you don't
know<00:00:19.920> those<00:00:20.070> movements<00:00:20.609> you<00:00:20.699> want<00:00:20.880> it<00:00:20.970> might

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
know those movements you want it might

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.460 
know those movements you want it might
want<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.390> check<00:00:21.600> out<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.840> videos<00:00:22.109> on<00:00:22.260> those

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
want to check out the videos on those

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.470 
want to check out the videos on those
movements<00:00:22.920> first<00:00:23.100> before<00:00:23.640> you<00:00:23.910> try<00:00:24.060> adding

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
movements first before you try adding

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.769 
movements first before you try adding
the<00:00:24.600> Joule<00:00:24.810> into<00:00:25.320> them<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:26.400> Joule<00:00:26.730> has<00:00:27.510> two

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
the Joule into them the Joule has two

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.480 
the Joule into them the Joule has two
different<00:00:27.930> variations<00:00:28.410> that<00:00:28.769> I<00:00:28.980> use<00:00:29.250> most

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
different variations that I use most

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.510 
different variations that I use most
often<00:00:29.730> one<00:00:30.510> is<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.720> twisting<00:00:31.320> motion<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:31.949> one

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
often one is a twisting motion and one

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.220 
often one is a twisting motion and one
is<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.759> little<00:00:33.059> bit<00:00:33.180> more<00:00:33.420> of<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.750> controlled

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
is a little bit more of a controlled

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.880 
is a little bit more of a controlled
twist<00:00:34.860> twist<00:00:35.190> in<00:00:35.430> either<00:00:36.300> way<00:00:36.809> our<00:00:37.110> twisting

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
twist twist in either way our twisting

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.650 
twist twist in either way our twisting
motion<00:00:38.250> is<00:00:38.340> coming<00:00:38.670> here<00:00:38.879> from<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.210> hips<00:00:39.450> I

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
motion is coming here from the hips I

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.389 
motion is coming here from the hips I
think<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.469> twisting<00:00:40.800> motion<00:00:40.980> is<00:00:41.250> coming

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
think of the twisting motion is coming

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.100 
think of the twisting motion is coming
from<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.879> obliques<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.570> lifts<00:00:42.899> from<00:00:43.020> the

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
from the obliques and lifts from the

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.440 
from the obliques and lifts from the
knees<00:00:43.469> more<00:00:44.280> from<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.640> obliques<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.210> want<00:00:45.360> to

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
knees more from the obliques you want to

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.450 
knees more from the obliques you want to
utilize<00:00:45.629> those<00:00:46.230> muscles<00:00:46.590> on<00:00:46.710> either<00:00:46.829> side<00:00:47.219> of

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
utilize those muscles on either side of

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.029 
utilize those muscles on either side of
your<00:00:47.640> belly<00:00:47.910> button<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.870> contract<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.680> to

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
your belly button to contract and to

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.400 
your belly button to contract and to
pull<00:00:50.250> your<00:00:50.399> hips<00:00:50.670> front<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.750> back<00:00:51.930> kind<00:00:52.350> of

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
pull your hips front and back kind of

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.260 
pull your hips front and back kind of
like<00:00:52.590> an<00:00:52.770> educator<00:00:53.280> in<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.489> washing<00:00:53.670> machine

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
like an educator in a washing machine

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.869 
like an educator in a washing machine
so<00:00:54.600> there's<00:00:54.840> your<00:00:55.110> twist<00:00:55.530> when<00:00:56.250> we<00:00:56.430> do<00:00:56.670> the

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
so there's your twist when we do the

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.880 
so there's your twist when we do the
Joule<00:00:57.120> most<00:00:57.780> often<00:00:58.260> our<00:00:58.410> weight<00:00:58.559> is<00:00:58.680> going<00:00:58.829> to

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
Joule most often our weight is going to

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.650 
Joule most often our weight is going to
be<00:00:58.980> more<00:00:59.129> heavily<00:00:59.460> on<00:00:59.699> one<00:00:59.940> leg<00:01:00.210> so<00:01:00.390> let's<00:01:00.539> go

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
be more heavily on one leg so let's go

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.400 
be more heavily on one leg so let's go
ahead<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:00.989> try<00:01:01.170> this

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
ahead and try this

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.349 
ahead and try this
putting<00:01:01.949> our<00:01:02.070> weight<00:01:02.280> onto<00:01:02.550> our<00:01:02.879> right<00:01:03.090> foot

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
putting our weight onto our right foot

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.340 
putting our weight onto our right foot
our<00:01:03.480> left<00:01:03.510> foot<00:01:03.870> is<00:01:03.989> just<00:01:04.199> there<00:01:04.320> for

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
our left foot is just there for

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.010 
our left foot is just there for
stability<00:01:05.040> so<00:01:05.220> my<00:01:05.400> so<00:01:05.939> my<00:01:06.090> weight<00:01:06.360> is<00:01:06.540> resting

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
stability so my so my weight is resting

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.560 
stability so my so my weight is resting
gently<00:01:07.229> on<00:01:07.439> my<00:01:07.530> toe<00:01:07.710> our<00:01:08.159> jewel<00:01:08.939> has<00:01:09.240> one<00:01:09.450> of

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
gently on my toe our jewel has one of

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.480 
gently on my toe our jewel has one of
two<00:01:09.720> options<00:01:09.869> option<00:01:10.200> one<00:01:10.710> it's<00:01:11.220> just<00:01:11.430> a

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
two options option one it's just a

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.730 
two options option one it's just a
little<00:01:11.670> push<00:01:11.970> with<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.689> little<00:01:12.990> jiggle<00:01:13.380> so<00:01:13.619> I've

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
little push with a little jiggle so I've

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.010 
little push with a little jiggle so I've
started<00:01:14.070> my<00:01:14.369> twist<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:14.939> then<00:01:15.659> I've<00:01:15.750> allowed

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
started my twist and then I've allowed

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.260 
started my twist and then I've allowed
my<00:01:16.229> hips<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.590> just<00:01:16.770> jiggle<00:01:17.159> on<00:01:17.280> their<00:01:17.430> own<00:01:17.549> push

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
my hips to just jiggle on their own push

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.039 
my hips to just jiggle on their own push
jiggle-jiggle<00:01:19.100> push<00:01:20.100> jiggle<00:01:20.549> jiggle<00:01:21.049> push

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
jiggle jiggle push jiggle jiggle let's

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.300 
jiggle jiggle push jiggle jiggle let's
try<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.080> on<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.259> other<00:01:25.350> side<00:01:25.470> so<00:01:25.890> weight<00:01:26.070> is<00:01:26.220> on

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
try it on the other side so weight is on

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.700 
try it on the other side so weight is on
the<00:01:26.369> left<00:01:26.700> same<00:01:27.360> idea<00:01:27.689> here<00:01:27.960> keeping<00:01:28.590> the

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
the left same idea here keeping the

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.039 
the left same idea here keeping the
weight<00:01:28.829> nice<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.520> nice<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.450> centered<00:01:30.810> on<00:01:30.930> the

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
weight nice and nice and centered on the

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.249 
weight nice and nice and centered on the
left<00:01:31.290> keeping<00:01:31.950> your<00:01:32.040> hips<00:01:32.280> even<00:01:32.780> push<00:01:33.780> jiggle

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
left keeping your hips even push jiggle

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.100 
left keeping your hips even push jiggle
jiggle<00:01:34.700> push<00:01:35.700> jiggle<00:01:36.150> jiggle<00:01:36.479> so<00:01:36.869> I<00:01:36.930> give<00:01:37.079> a

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
jiggle push jiggle jiggle so I give a

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.929 
jiggle push jiggle jiggle so I give a
little<00:01:37.290> push<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:38.189> can<00:01:38.310> think<00:01:38.460> about<00:01:38.490> using
