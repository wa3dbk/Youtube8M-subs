00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:12.900
 two open shots twice 300 62 x 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:15.340
 250 km h also twice the same car 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.410
 No 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.880
 bmw against bmw roadster convertible what is 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.400
 behind it 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.460
 He must be asked modern convertibles 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.840
 Always sporty roadster 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.029
 What is the right choice now? 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.200
 cable replace the roadster or it the 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.330
 red already half a cable that 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:36.489
 Wanted to find out I can give it a try 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:41.239
 the contractors of the roadster bmw z4 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:44.360
 sdrive35i against the bmw 135 kw 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:46.129
 the motorization identical pure 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.730
 muscular strength does not become this duel 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:48.730
 decide 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.240
 Now I'm sitting on a soft convertible 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.070
 stand open so long ago 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.540
 bonnet roadster feeling deep 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.130
 sitting position is almost on the 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.710
 rear axle and you almost a bit 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.180
 moderately so far up so sport friends 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.570
 that a red be long bonnet 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.550
 but true hardtop roadster goes to the 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.920
 not at all I often and can do it 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.600
 take four people to the emergency 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.860
 We were already looking up 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.290
 the race track ask the same again 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.060
 are you your first impression so for 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.960
 a convertible is the bird here but 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.580
 really good 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.470
 he has the same engine as you in the 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.270
 roadster so that's very close 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.930
 So that's going to be tight 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.850
 and really tight not only visually 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.250
 Sports cannon also in the performance 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:45.470
 sticks the only slightly heavier 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:48.020
 convertible the two-seater in vienna long ago 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.570
 Built-in six-cylinder rear-wheel drive 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.540
 softtop sporty body and the 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.590
 both rear seats are there as an addition to the 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.930
 135 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.810
 how is actually a two plus two 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.370
 roadster the high seating position and the 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.690
 good overview, however, can not be 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.760
 the feeling arise 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.500
 it's the athlete's seat 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:10.640
 music teacher and in this case no 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.390
 plus point legal against the z4 one 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.370
 bonnet the one 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.440
 heliport seating position 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.330
 felt in the trunk in dangerous 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.030
 shark look to the mix of retro 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.610
 and modern so must a roadster today 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.700
 appearance 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.330
 adaptive chassis and 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.400
 double clutch transmission he goes in 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.890
 As far as automobile color spaces go, that's all 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.320
 about better sprint behavior than when 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.600
 coffee but also larger driving 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:41.410
 challenge not least because of 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:43.330
 hair half wild hair mixed up 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.810
 whistling in the ears and slightly watery 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.880
 eyes 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.880
 That's the floating tour 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:54.299
 here apparently pure as the compromise for 

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:56.430
 which we decide on at the end of z4 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:58.500
 that was very close the race was 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.650
 scary close to the convertible but on 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.629
 the end of the z4 of the commodity remains open 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.220
 monster but an authority on everyone 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:06.269
 If both times when I'm four 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.620
 people from the city drive home 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.819
 wants then I need something is 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.920
 played a bit soft, of course 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:12.689
 do you have beautiful we say it seems one 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.040
 to have a big circle of acquaintances for it 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:19.690
 This is an option for many 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:23.740
 People take away men car 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:26.040
 driving pleasure and feeling before use but that 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.230
 we were outside 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.220
 neighbors they had the last time 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.610
 convertible with 2 1 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.610
