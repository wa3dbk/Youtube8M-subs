00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.460
 well found today we will take you to discover 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.089
 a real gem is called 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.920
 at custom 19 comes from competence e 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.990
 from the passion of the engineer andrea there 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.689
 to a series of models have already come out 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:26.330
 get to know the custom tel 30 then the 25 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.330
 21 this is the last born 19 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.530
 go Go 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.149
 then first of all what kind of 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.399
 boat 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.899
 we are talking of course you see 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:49.850
 immediately from the lines it is a 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:51.739
 fishman, however, because we said a 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.769
 little gem it is not fisherman 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.180
 whatever we are accustomed to 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:58.339
 school building typically 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.229
 American that are robust but are 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:02.809
 even very heavy there is a lot of material 

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:04.699
 on board and consequently on equal terms 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.680
 there is also a dimension to having to move them 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.080
 need to power with many horses 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.119
 in this case the engineer's approach 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.310
 of it was completely the opposite it is 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.530
 started from a desire to want to do 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.899
 a sturdy boat yes of course the 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.479
 type requires it but extremely 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:22.640
 light and resistant therefore the greatest 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.560
 part of this boat is built for 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.179
 infusion and most of the 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.780
 material used is the fiber of 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:28.880
 carbon 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.250
 the result which is well above all the 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.350
 you can see the engine behind me 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.330
 which mounts is simply a 40 horses 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.039
 yes it is a very modern engine 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.390
 of course the new suzuki we know 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:41.000
 which is a series of technological discoveries 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.220
 he has a lot of couples he will never accept 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.810
 or 40 horses therefore also with the 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.569
 advantage that can be brought without 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.340
 patent is enough this engine yes 

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:52.190
 certainly because you think this 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:55.759
 dry hull without the engine e 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:58.099
 without the batteries it weighs only 450 kg 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:01.789
 the total mass with everything 

00:01:58.099 --> 00:02:04.340
 installed is 650 kg so all 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:06.440
 this reduction of the masses 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.940
 of course without that I go to the detriment 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.340
 of robustness because we have said 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.500
 coal infusion results in a 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.629
 exceptional behavior at sea 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.580
 very agile and at the same time in one 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:18.349
 hull that is always very much anyway 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.769
 solid and now we're going to try 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:20.769
 for you 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.460
 so let's start with this al 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.900
 19 let's start with the throttle 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.090
 of course the trim of the outboards 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.460
 now at 0 we have to leave planing 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.380
 we could also give all the throttle in 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.210
 once at the 40 horsepower engine you don't 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.990
 scares however we start with a bit of 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.990
 progression 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:55.739
 we are safely already on the plane 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.129
 this we can also found the 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.129
 manacle 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.810
 here is 4,200 concrete laps in the 14th of December 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:11.840
 now let's try the maximum speed 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.569
 we are 40 horses we remember it brings 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.370
 without a license 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:20.370
 the maximum tip is 26 knots 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.120
 the alonso lehman boat no joke 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.010
 no spray of water to witness 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.120
 of good balance but above all 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.120
 of very low weight 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:46.590
 the pull as on all boats 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.270
 with outboard engine you can do a 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.520
 different levels can of course 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.830
 fall very gait around 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:55.080
 completely the bar that the boat is 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.910
 turns around in a handkerchief naturally 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.510
 this way you lose the glide you lose 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.370
 the pace 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:03.240
 here you can find a good compromise 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:05.460
 even lowering to 4,500 rpm, yes 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:08.270
 loses a lot of speed I repeat the hull is 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:10.680
 very light and immediately recovers 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.790
 the general impression in navigation is 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.590
 Great 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.260
 I never tire of repeating it but why 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.930
 really it is the peculiarity that stands out in 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:21.600
 every moment the hull is very light 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.550
 therefore very agile it moves in a moment 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.580
 in all directions there is always the 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:29.240
 feeling of being able to govern it in 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.240
 better ways 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.879
 well we saw the dynamic part 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:47.190
 we have seen how this navigates to the 19th 

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:49.560
 now we would like to dwell a little on 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:52.259
 some construction details is a boat 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.960
 made by a fisherman for the real 

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:56.639
 fishermen and therefore can be seen in many things 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.979
 in many parts that are on board 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:00.990
 we have a series of rod holders we have 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:03.569
 some beautiful bears meat at rest in 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:06.000
 aluminum along the two side walls 

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:08.490
 like the padding of this interior of the 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.620
 bottazzo follows all 360 degrees of 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.840
 boat cockpit and then again 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.729
 we have the external profile of the fender 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.800
 that in rubber to go to damage the 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:18.780
 lines when we are fishing for one 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:22.110
 beautiful live tub in front with the 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:24.360
 90 liter recirculation and then in general 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.099
 in short, and there are no frills 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.840
 they would be useless if not annoying 

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:30.780
 even a web tv Italy utica 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.610
 let's see for example the cockpit is everything 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.199
 in a single printed counter provided here 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.789
 of anti - slip naturally in the 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:37.199
 part of the walkways, however, less 

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:39.150
 cavity also means less 

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:42.000
 possibility of dirtying and more ease 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.710
 of washing we have only a small one 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.569
 I like this support by walking in 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:48.270
 stainless steel are two tech inserts 

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:51.030
 to make it a little bit more chic 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:53.039
 let's say the boat in general a product 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:55.139
 that really like it already is for all 

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:58.110
 other custom products will be 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:06:00.449
 beloved by those who really fish with a 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:03.090
 different concept instead of fisherman 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:05.099
 which is heavy sturdy because heavy that 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:07.319
 must be motorized accordingly 

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:09.000
 instead a boat that is very light 

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:11.849
 then you may also need a 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.620
 engine much less powerful but at the same level 

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:15.449
 performance therefore means minors 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:18.710
 consumption and lower emissions and in the end 

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:18.710
 lower management costs
