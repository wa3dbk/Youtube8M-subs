the<00:01:03.629> first<00:01:03.930> we<00:01:04.439> are<00:01:04.589> still<00:01:04.860> quiet<00:01:05.250> away<00:01:05.670> from

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
the first we are still quiet away from

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.210 
the first we are still quiet away from
the<00:01:06.090> release<00:01:06.510> so<00:01:06.900> we're<00:01:07.530> know<00:01:07.799> when<00:01:08.010> they're

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
the release so we're know when they're

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.399

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
closer to the release date i guess so i

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.950 
closer to the release date i guess so i
wouldn't<00:01:10.920> expect<00:01:11.010> any<00:01:11.549> information<00:01:12.479> as<00:01:12.600> off

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
wouldn't expect any information as off

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.719 
wouldn't expect any information as off
like<00:01:13.229> this<00:01:13.500> month<00:01:13.860> for<00:01:13.950> anything<00:01:14.310> like<00:01:14.700> that

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
like this month for anything like that

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.300 
like this month for anything like that
but<00:01:15.600> in<00:01:15.720> terms<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:16.080> sort<00:01:16.320> of<00:01:16.380> animals<00:01:16.830> i<00:01:16.979> think

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
but in terms of sort of animals i think

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.160 
but in terms of sort of animals i think
we<00:01:17.490> are<00:01:17.520> going<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:18.060> get<00:01:18.240> just<00:01:18.540> by<00:01:18.600> taking<00:01:18.960> a

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.640 
happen but just the basic farm animals
now<00:01:35.400> in<00:01:35.520> terms<00:01:35.729> of<00:01:35.880> other<00:01:36.119> animals<00:01:36.360> I<00:01:36.900> do<00:01:36.960> think

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
now in terms of other animals I do think

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.080 
now in terms of other animals I do think
we<00:01:37.770> are<00:01:37.920> gonna<00:01:38.070> get<00:01:38.280> some<00:01:38.460> sea<00:01:38.700> creature

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
we are gonna get some sea creature

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.960 
we are gonna get some sea creature
simply<00:01:39.540> due<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.170> fee<00:01:40.650> see<00:01:41.340> I<00:01:41.369> guess<00:01:41.700> in<00:01:41.850> the

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
simply due to fee see I guess in the

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.149 
simply due to fee see I guess in the
game<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.329> is<00:01:42.420> absolutely<00:01:42.990> huge<00:01:43.409> so<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:43.979> would

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
game it is absolutely huge so it would

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.859 
game it is absolutely huge so it would
be<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.340> bit<00:01:44.520> pointless<00:01:44.729> if<00:01:45.149> there<00:01:45.299> was<00:01:45.390> nothing

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
be a bit pointless if there was nothing

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.230 
be a bit pointless if there was nothing
in<00:01:46.049> there<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.500> there<00:01:46.619> was<00:01:46.710> I<00:01:46.829> guess<00:01:47.070> no<00:01:47.579> danger

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
in there and there was I guess no danger

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.330 
in there and there was I guess no danger
so<00:01:48.479> maybe<00:01:48.689> sharks<00:01:49.200> are<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.409> killer<00:01:49.799> whale<00:01:50.100> which

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
so maybe sharks are a killer whale which

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.889 
so maybe sharks are a killer whale which
would<00:01:50.460> just<00:01:50.610> be<00:01:50.640> absolutely<00:01:51.119> insane<00:01:51.630> and

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
would just be absolutely insane and

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.050 
would just be absolutely insane and
don't<00:01:52.530> forget<00:01:52.619> in<00:01:52.860> just<00:01:53.159> cause<00:01:53.310> 2<00:01:53.520> I<00:01:53.700> believe

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
don't forget in just cause 2 I believe

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.420 
don't forget in just cause 2 I believe
there<00:01:54.270> was<00:01:54.450> a<00:01:54.509> way<00:01:54.899> or<00:01:55.079> Easter<00:01:55.500> egg<00:01:55.680> as<00:01:55.890> well<00:01:56.310> as

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
there was a way or Easter egg as well as

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.580 
there was a way or Easter egg as well as
so<00:01:56.610> if<00:01:56.670> that<00:01:56.880> wasn't<00:01:57.149> just<00:01:57.329> go<00:01:57.509> soon<00:01:57.780> maybe<00:01:58.380> if

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
so if that wasn't just go soon maybe if

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.830 
so if that wasn't just go soon maybe if
they<00:01:58.680> can<00:01:58.829> actually<00:01:59.040> put<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.579> moving<00:02:00.119> wow<00:02:00.329> into

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
they can actually put a moving wow into

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.289 
they can actually put a moving wow into
Just<00:02:01.110> Cause<00:02:01.320> free<00:02:01.710> now<00:02:02.490> another<00:02:02.790> really<00:02:03.030> cool

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
animal that I think would fit well in

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.290 
animal that I think would fit well in
the<00:02:05.130> game<00:02:05.340> is<00:02:05.520> actually<00:02:05.729> a<00:02:06.090> dog<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.930> ice

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
the game is actually a dog and the ice

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.870 
the game is actually a dog and the ice
I<00:02:07.360> have<00:02:07.690> is<00:02:07.900> /<00:02:08.320> I<00:02:08.560> guess<00:02:08.830> base<00:02:09.190> you<00:02:09.490> have<00:02:09.700> your

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
own sort of dog and it just belongs to

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.830 
own sort of dog and it just belongs to
like<00:02:12.280> the<00:02:12.430> rebels<00:02:12.820> and<00:02:12.970> stuff<00:02:13.210> like<00:02:13.390> that<00:02:13.450> when

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
like the rebels and stuff like that when

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.660 
like the rebels and stuff like that when
you<00:02:13.990> go<00:02:14.140> out<00:02:14.320> it's<00:02:14.770> like<00:02:14.920> an<00:02:15.040> option<00:02:15.400> for<00:02:15.580> them

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
you go out it's like an option for them

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.220 
you go out it's like an option for them
just<00:02:15.910> to<00:02:16.000> tag<00:02:16.240> along<00:02:16.270> with<00:02:16.570> you<00:02:17.020> or<00:02:17.200> something
