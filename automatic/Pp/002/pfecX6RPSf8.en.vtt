00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
so long so seeing a bit again oh I just

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.580 
so long so seeing a bit again oh I just
did<00:03:20.830> that<00:03:21.129> so<00:03:21.540> push<00:03:22.540> chance<00:03:22.780> on<00:03:22.959> that<00:03:23.170> when

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
did that so push chance on that when

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:30.380 
did that so push chance on that when
this<00:03:23.680> comes<00:03:23.950> up<00:03:26.909> because<00:03:27.909> you<00:03:28.269> don't<00:03:28.480> need<00:03:28.690> the

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
this comes up because you don't need the

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.170 
this comes up because you don't need the
vmware<00:03:31.390> to<00:03:31.540> us<00:03:31.720> for<00:03:32.650> windows<00:03:33.099> seven<00:03:33.489> I<00:03:33.700> think

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
vmware to us for windows seven I think

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.449 
vmware to us for windows seven I think
it<00:03:34.239> doesn't<00:03:34.510> do<00:03:35.079> any<00:03:35.319> more<00:03:36.510> whatever<00:03:38.310> you<00:03:39.310> can
