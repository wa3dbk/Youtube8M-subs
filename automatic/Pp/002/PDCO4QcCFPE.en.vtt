00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.710
 description 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.779
 the impression is that hollywood is in 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.119
 recent years have suffered terribly from 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.580
 obesity and just lazy coming up 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.480
 something new or just all of us 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:33.090
 put the bolt and with the words yes so they eat 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.780
 releases mxr and maikon reboot for fish then 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.899
 so guys i have a very important statement 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:44.629
 today officially ended ideas for 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.629
 film and now we start everything given 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:51.980
 the arrival of the train to the coffin station and here 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.100
 another reboot that fell on us 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.100
 fantastic four 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:14.220
 after watching this movie, I realized that 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.320
 maybe i will look it again if 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.479
 very much grisu not fall into 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.060
 the underworld because precisely this 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.490
 film I think there and torture lovers 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.190
 cinema of the very first minutes me a movie 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.880
 seemed incredibly tedious and to blame for that 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:32.240
 there was a script and a terrible acting game 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.470
 children who play there just play 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.810
 disgusting in the blame movie review 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.940
 myself i praised hollywood to school young 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.060
 actors for a cool six-year game 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.880
 girls in it but for this film I understood 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.090
 that apparently not all of its graduates 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.490
 understand the rule that once you play 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.039
 should be just a little bit like 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.080
 living person and turn scripts 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:58.530
 pleased us just incredible 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.810
 the number of lapses and jambs that we 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:05.340
 let's call you a new word 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:09.209
 Donati depeche professor only 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.310
 rice professor great screenwriter yes what have 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:14.640
 I just understand me in the script 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.769
 some details I do not fit 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.989
 scientists who at the beginning of the film seems 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:22.170
 very smart i am this well in every way 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:24.660
 I emphasize and then the film shows 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.300
 that they are complete morons 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.750
 generator that have no 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:33.930
 gray matter in the head they thump and 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:37.410
 commit acts just crap bolt on 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:40.260
 any scientific facts and reflections i 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:43.130
 I just think I can rewrite 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.870
 be it all or what to do 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.480
 stop-stop-stop machine remember the main thing 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:51.870
 bad script writer rule which 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:55.200
 called up to you or I donat and 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:58.340
 tasteless latvia we never nothing 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:01.830
 rewrite wrote a piece of paper 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.700
 debug went on another own and this one already 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.270
 don't look 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:10.230
 can't be faster wrote more earned 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.550
 stupid i understand it is a comic i understand 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.020
 that the plot in such films is not 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.990
 be based on any scientific 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:18.740
 facts but you can't forget the likes 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:21.180
 and realistic belief in existence 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.830
 superheroes of parallel worlds and 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.140
 fantastic creatures 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:28.290
 possible only when the rules 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.810
 of our world and the created touch 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.820
 clever screenwriters use scientific 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:36.200
 fiction unexplored human 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:39.660
 opportunities and our fantasy in order to create 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.550
 other incredible awesome universe 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.820
 which will be actions on our something 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:47.100
 similar but use the tools will 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.350
 all the same they are very different 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.930
 just slaughtering god to describe everything 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:54.209
 the fact that just 1 head climbs namely 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.820
 so happens fantastic four 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:59.850
 I created a teleport that can 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:02.790
 send molecules to another 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.920
 the universe but true with this I do not know 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.540
 where is this universe but i can from 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.700
 of this universe return these items 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.010
 back friends how are you doing 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:14.280
 how molecules move in space 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:16.290
 while absolutely without your control and 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.870
 with the universe where there is no your 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:22.169
 exposure they come back and I 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:25.560
 Generally not in the mouth but it works and I 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:28.410
 I consider it safe so the following 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.510
 Items that I sent there will be 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.460
 I have 3 more people 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.380
 eco whole style you can tell just 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.200
 one sentence and maybe just 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.940
 the script was written 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.740
 that's why I didnâ€™t say much about him 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.200
 because there is nothing to tell 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.300
 the whole movie looks so obvious kid 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.100
 created a teleport unknown universe not 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.050
 gave him a lot of dough I have not decided yet 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.330
 fuck before baba and teleport 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.580
 then with your friends idiots and how 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.590
 often happens after a party I picked up 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.960
 self bait a bunch of problems and now i'm 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.480
 super hero but let's postpone the topic 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.040
 script miss it and take a look at this 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.080
 film as let us visually 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.300
 an attraction to water that is not a script 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:10.980
 when there is no script there is a cool picture 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:13.710
 but no peace here either 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.930
 I saw a couple of episodes for the whole movie 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:18.810
 any graphics at all 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:21.780
 really good and failed 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:24.480
 to see interesting exciting scenes 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:27.000
 as for me not at all I swear by a knot 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.820
 for a moment i thought i was just 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.130
 I not on the film came seriously thought 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:34.860
 can i come to parody some or 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.750
 cover the pirated version can us 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.120
 show the thesis of one of 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:41.280
 students and by the way here on graduate 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.410
 work, he looks well on solid 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.770
 Fourth, but as on full-length 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:46.920
 film 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:49.260
 It generally costs in general I hardly 

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.270
 watched the desire to stop all this 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:53.910
 the horror for the movie was crucified not 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:56.280
 did not stop sadly because I 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:58.710
 this waste my time getting 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:01.530
 sad for marvel fans and for their tears 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:03.690
 grief after this movie from what u 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:07.080
 the creator of this film is still out of my hands 

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:09.960
 can not shoot further a lot of things 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:12.480
 pleased only one my opinion was not 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:15.420
 single international rating check out 

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:19.080
 a film of 4 points in a film search 

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:19.530
 scored 4 more than 90 percent of reviews about 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.380
 the movie 

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:24.720
 negative and the payback of the film is under 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:26.760
 big question I certainly did not call 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:29.580
 grow I didn't live anything bad 

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:32.250
 creators we all make mistakes and maybe 

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:34.860
 not too just messed up but I'm glad 

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:37.530
 because there is the fact that the quickie is not 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:39.810
 It was possible the creators of this film 

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:41.090
 and others are also such results 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:43.520
 make ass 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:45.680
 Matza that, nevertheless, our people do not all eat 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.660
 and yet in the future will have to try 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:51.949
 and create something really worthwhile 

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:54.620
 they do what we know the term is not 

00:06:51.949 --> 00:06:57.260
 advise on this film look better 

00:06:54.620 --> 00:07:00.080
 something else on it is my boiling 

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:05.139
 opinion ends wish you good 

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:05.139
 good luck movie and bye bye
