just fixed up this old Micromax sp12
mixer<00:00:05.069> this<00:00:05.759> is<00:00:06.000> from<00:00:06.569> Yorkville<00:00:07.049> audio<00:00:07.440> a<00:00:07.500> 500

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
mixer this is from Yorkville audio a 500

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.430 
mixer this is from Yorkville audio a 500
watt<00:00:08.599> total<00:00:09.599> I<00:00:09.719> don't<00:00:09.870> know<00:00:09.929> if<00:00:09.990> that's<00:00:10.170> peak

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
watt total I don't know if that's peak

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.970 
watt total I don't know if that's peak
or<00:00:10.740> rms<00:00:11.580> they<00:00:12.000> they<00:00:12.929> claim<00:00:13.170> it's<00:00:13.349> 500<00:00:13.769> watts

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
or rms they they claim it's 500 watts

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.440 
or rms they they claim it's 500 watts
but<00:00:14.250> I<00:00:14.280> think<00:00:14.490> it's<00:00:14.610> a<00:00:14.670> lot<00:00:14.790> more<00:00:14.940> power<00:00:15.179> than

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
but I think it's a lot more power than

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.510 
but I think it's a lot more power than
that<00:00:15.630> especially<00:00:16.470> they<00:00:16.890> put<00:00:17.039> it<00:00:17.130> on<00:00:17.220> some<00:00:17.400> good

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
that especially they put it on some good

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.939 
that especially they put it on some good
