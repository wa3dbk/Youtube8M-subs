00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:11.020
 then makes him nice and we do not 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:14.080
 show that the child is a brand 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:17.529
 French like that and it is too much 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:20.500
 wrong like that and it's really bossed spa 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:22.300
 face the time and then mixing art and on 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:26.290
 start again and we will form them at an angle 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:36.940
 I have already applied the former group 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:40.800
 16 children and top coat and your 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:43.450
 nail polish blah and deschizeaux 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.520
 Aps cut stone to cut the 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.390
 heads but if you have the talent it's 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.500
 like any high couple 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:52.780
 the afternoon should be swallowed 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:58.180
 after applying your door you 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:01:01.360
 go put kind of the type yes this convoy 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.670
 or is it blurry ok we stop 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.259
 as you discover your tender with 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.990
 the tate as long as you go not 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:09.250
 put the blame so the part you 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.049
 go put the blayais pose as 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.829
 not have peace to go take 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:17.590
 place because ultimately this 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:19.600
 contract when I understand that you 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.130
 go take the track not if you 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.229
 stop this theme because the cast and 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:27.810
 you do not stop at the angle and you 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.810
 go as thought find themselves the 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:38.100
 weeks after that do we see 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.100
 like that 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.610
 well 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:02:00.640
 nothing like that all the time yeah 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:02:07.000
 especially your nails it's still fast 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:07.000
 ok yes yes it does not take long 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.860
 ok so africa is salty so at have 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.410
 now you have like jean reno 2002 the 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.050
 life after ben taleb the tempo like that 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.540
 but here I have a leg and after step 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.940
 the cards as on the angles for 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.600
 protect there is something in his custody too 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.340
 Longer 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:43.010
 then add a shine confessing yeah 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:46.010
 yeah so like that and after at the end 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.620
 you worry you do not you 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.410
 deceive times in a single wind of 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.700
 mia nails and of course the door and 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.590
 maybe you have some verniolle 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.900
 once you remove that but it's his 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:02.360
 know you know sir coins 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:04.480
