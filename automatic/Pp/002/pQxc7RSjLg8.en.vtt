00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.750
 where I am at this moment 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.090
 today we are going to talk about a topic 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:27.890
 the way of being that you should handle if 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.380
 you want to be attractive with women 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:33.020
 you will see women are attracted 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.629
 by men who meet certain 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.660
 future requirements men by some of 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:42.050
 those requirements because they simply 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:44.360
 they start looking for excuses for not 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.900
 be attracted to discarding 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.530
 easily for example a woman 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:54.030
 to tolerate a man 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:56.980
 that a man is precious very basic 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.170
 precious and that if the only thing you do 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.120
 is scratching the balls in the house and not 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.480
 work and do nothing else in life 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.129
 and not study 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.380
 to reach a point where the 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.900
 woman simply will not want to be 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.940
 with you no matter how attractive 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.220
 you do not matter what good language 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.170
 body projectes with women not 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.440
 they will want to stay with you 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.000
 obviously you will achieve if you understand 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.759

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:29.420
 to achieve the weight but you will not achieve 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:31.909
 that women remain attracted 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.280

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:37.280

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.250
 she worries about knitting 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:52.690
