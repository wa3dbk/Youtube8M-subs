the<00:00:57.539> old<00:00:57.660> one<00:00:57.780> out<00:00:58.190> and<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.820> can<00:01:00.030> see<00:01:00.390> there

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
the old one out and you can see there

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.719 
the old one out and you can see there
it's<00:01:02.280> kind<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.670> hexagon<00:01:03.030> shape<00:01:04.519> or<00:01:05.519> this

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
it's kind of a hexagon shape or this

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.880 
it's kind of a hexagon shape or this
knob<00:01:06.090> attaches<00:01:07.020> this<00:01:07.229> is<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.500> one<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:07.770> was

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
knob attaches this is the one that was

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:18.590 
knob attaches this is the one that was
in<00:01:08.070> it<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:09.350> this<00:01:10.350> one<00:01:10.409> is<00:01:10.860> round<00:01:14.570> and<00:01:17.479> so<00:01:18.479> the

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
in it and this one is round and so the

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.140 
in it and this one is round and so the
old<00:01:18.750> knob<00:01:18.960> won't<00:01:19.259> fit<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.650> new<00:01:19.770> switch<00:01:20.119> but<00:01:21.119> I

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
old knob won't fit the new switch but I

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.490 
old knob won't fit the new switch but I
think<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.450> got<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:21.659> solution<00:01:22.020> for<00:01:22.170> that<00:01:22.409> I'm

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
think I got a solution for that I'm

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.160 
think I got a solution for that I'm
going<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.740> drill<00:01:23.009> this<00:01:23.189> out<00:01:23.600> and<00:01:24.600> cut<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.020> end

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
going to drill this out and cut the end

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.429 
going to drill this out and cut the end
off<00:01:25.380> right<00:01:25.740> there<00:01:26.540> and<00:01:27.540> then<00:01:27.659> tap<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.080> so<00:01:28.409> I

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
off right there and then tap it so I

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:29.929 
off right there and then tap it so I
have<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:28.680> little<00:01:28.860> set<00:01:29.130> screw<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.520> attach<00:01:29.640> to

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
have a little set screw to attach to

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.050 
have a little set screw to attach to
this<00:01:30.060> so<00:01:30.299> I<00:01:30.360> can<00:01:30.479> keep<00:01:30.600> my<00:01:30.659> old<00:01:30.990> knob<00:01:31.970> and<00:01:32.970> then

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
this so I can keep my old knob and then

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.050 
this so I can keep my old knob and then
the<00:01:33.210> other<00:01:33.329> problem<00:01:33.540> we<00:01:33.840> got<00:01:34.049> is<00:01:34.320> I<00:01:34.909> need<00:01:35.909> to

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
use this to match the other ones and

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.300 
use this to match the other ones and

there so don't look so too jumbled and
we<00:02:44.890> have<00:02:45.100> a<00:02:45.130> fuse<00:02:46.680> right<00:02:47.680> there<00:02:47.860> for<00:02:48.100> wipers

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
we have a fuse right there for wipers

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.370 
we have a fuse right there for wipers
now<00:02:50.049> let<00:02:50.170> me<00:02:50.290> stand<00:02:50.560> on<00:02:50.709> my<00:02:50.769> head<00:02:51.040> and<00:02:51.220> do<00:02:51.370> that

pretty<00:02:56.799> nice<00:02:57.160> and<00:02:57.430> neat<00:02:58.080> put<00:02:59.080> fuse<00:02:59.380> in<00:02:59.590> so<00:02:59.920> the

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
pretty nice and neat put fuse in so the

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:13.290 
pretty nice and neat put fuse in so the
wipers<00:03:00.370> work<00:03:00.989> let's<00:03:01.989> see<00:03:02.140> what<00:03:02.319> happens

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:23.020 

and<00:03:14.300> that<00:03:14.450> should<00:03:14.690> be<00:03:14.810> intermittent

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:35.740 

oh<00:03:32.110> we<00:03:33.110> got<00:03:33.290> no<00:03:33.410> intermittent<00:03:34.510> I'll<00:03:35.510> have<00:03:35.630> to

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
oh we got no intermittent I'll have to

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:41.800 
oh we got no intermittent I'll have to
investigate<00:03:36.140> that<00:03:36.350> a<00:03:40.090> little<00:03:41.090> brace<00:03:41.330> quiet

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
investigate that a little brace quiet

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.280 
investigate that a little brace quiet
things<00:03:42.200> up<00:03:42.440> quite<00:03:42.800> a<00:03:42.860> bit<00:03:43.220> I<00:03:44.140> think<00:03:45.140> some

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
things up quite a bit I think some

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.020 
things up quite a bit I think some
longer<00:03:45.650> wiper<00:03:45.920> blades<00:03:47.020> will<00:03:48.020> be<00:03:48.170> in<00:03:48.260> business

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
longer wiper blades will be in business

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.090 
longer wiper blades will be in business
all<00:03:50.030> right<00:03:50.180> one<00:03:50.390> more<00:03:50.569> time<00:03:50.840> I<00:03:50.870> had<00:03:51.680> my<00:03:51.860> wires

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
all right one more time I had my wires

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:59.470 
all right one more time I had my wires
and<00:03:52.310> mixed<00:03:52.610> up<00:03:56.200> there's<00:03:57.200> some<00:03:57.320> reason<00:03:58.480> the

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
and mixed up there's some reason the

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.330 
and mixed up there's some reason the
intermittent<00:04:00.080> is<00:04:00.170> sleepy<00:04:02.890> now<00:04:03.890> it<00:04:04.040> starts

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
intermittent is sleepy now it starts

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:12.460 
intermittent is sleepy now it starts
working<00:04:04.730> I<00:04:09.250> don't<00:04:10.250> know<00:04:10.459> why<00:04:10.640> that<00:04:10.819> is<00:04:11.470> but

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
working I don't know why that is but

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:22.409 
working I don't know why that is but
that's<00:04:12.680> the<00:04:12.800> way<00:04:12.920> it<00:04:13.040> is<00:04:20.440> well<00:04:21.440> we<00:04:21.560> got<00:04:21.709> wipers

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
that's the way it is well we got wipers

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:25.330 
that's the way it is well we got wipers
that's<00:04:23.419> a<00:04:23.570> success<00:04:24.020> here<00:04:24.889> in<00:04:24.950> a<00:04:24.979> minute<00:04:25.130> I'll

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
that's a success here in a minute I'll

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.070 
that's a success here in a minute I'll
give<00:04:25.970> some<00:04:26.180> measurements<00:04:26.690> of<00:04:26.750> that<00:04:26.840> wiper

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
give some measurements of that wiper

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.120 
give some measurements of that wiper
motor<00:04:27.380> I<00:04:27.500> used<00:04:27.860> and<00:04:28.160> how<00:04:29.090> I<00:04:29.150> wired<00:04:29.540> it<00:04:29.720> up<00:04:30.130> all

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
motor I used and how I wired it up all

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.810 
motor I used and how I wired it up all
right<00:04:31.250> there's<00:04:31.430> the<00:04:31.550> wiper<00:04:31.910> motor<00:04:31.940> I<00:04:32.240> used

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
right there's the wiper motor I used

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.670 
right there's the wiper motor I used
it's<00:04:34.820> about<00:04:35.000> eight<00:04:35.210> and<00:04:35.300> a<00:04:35.419> half<00:04:35.620> inches<00:04:36.620> long

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
it's about eight and a half inches long

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:47.250 
it's about eight and a half inches long
overall<00:04:39.100> and<00:04:40.100> turn<00:04:40.610> it<00:04:40.820> up<00:04:45.280> it's<00:04:46.280> only<00:04:46.430> about

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
overall and turn it up it's only about

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:53.080 
overall and turn it up it's only about
two<00:04:48.260> inches<00:04:48.590> deep<00:04:48.830> that<00:04:49.160> way<00:04:51.550> if<00:04:52.550> you<00:04:52.729> remove

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
two inches deep that way if you remove

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.010 
two inches deep that way if you remove
that<00:04:53.890> thing<00:04:54.890> which<00:04:55.130> I<00:04:55.310> did

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
that thing which I did

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:02.830 
that thing which I did
and<00:04:57.500> then<00:04:57.740> right<00:04:58.010> here<00:05:01.330> it's<00:05:02.330> about<00:05:02.510> two

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
and then right here it's about two

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:08.250 
and then right here it's about two
inches<00:05:03.290> from<00:05:04.870> this<00:05:05.870> point<00:05:06.200> to<00:05:06.740> this<00:05:06.920> point<00:05:07.070> I

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
inches from this point to this point I

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.240 
inches from this point to this point I
suppose<00:05:09.260> some<00:05:09.500> of<00:05:09.590> you<00:05:09.680> might<00:05:09.860> want<00:05:10.040> it<00:05:10.130> to

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
suppose some of you might want it to

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.160 
suppose some of you might want it to
pass<00:05:10.580> through<00:05:10.940> something<00:05:11.540> so<00:05:11.750> it's<00:05:11.900> probably

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:12.170 
pass through something so it's probably

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:13.330 
pass through something so it's probably
an<00:05:12.290> inch<00:05:12.380> and<00:05:12.560> a<00:05:12.590> half<00:05:12.620> where<00:05:12.950> you<00:05:13.010> could<00:05:13.160> put

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
an inch and a half where you could put

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:18.820 
an inch and a half where you could put
an<00:05:13.460> eye<00:05:13.610> on<00:05:13.820> it<00:05:13.970> and<00:05:14.000> tighten<00:05:14.360> it<00:05:14.510> up<00:05:17.230> and<00:05:18.230> let's

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 
an eye on it and tighten it up and let's

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:28.810 
an eye on it and tighten it up and let's
say<00:05:19.040> this<00:05:19.310> way<00:05:24.400> it's<00:05:25.400> about<00:05:25.490> four<00:05:25.910> inches<00:05:27.820> sort

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 
say this way it's about four inches sort

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.030 
say this way it's about four inches sort
of<00:05:28.880> fit<00:05:29.060> in<00:05:29.150> a<00:05:29.180> pretty<00:05:29.420> pretty<00:05:29.960> tight<00:05:30.200> spot<00:05:30.380> I

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:31.040 
of fit in a pretty pretty tight spot I

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.550 
of fit in a pretty pretty tight spot I
found<00:05:31.270> to<00:05:32.270> wake<00:05:32.450> it<00:05:32.600> up<00:05:32.720> you<00:05:33.020> need<00:05:33.170> this<00:05:33.410> one

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
found to wake it up you need this one

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.020 
found to wake it up you need this one
needs<00:05:33.740> to<00:05:33.800> be<00:05:33.860> high<00:05:34.070> all<00:05:34.310> the<00:05:34.340> time<00:05:34.460> the<00:05:34.820> weight

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.030 
needs to be high all the time the weight

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:41.350 
needs to be high all the time the weight
is<00:05:35.180> hot<00:05:35.390> all<00:05:35.570> the<00:05:35.600> time<00:05:37.000> and<00:05:39.640> the<00:05:40.640> you<00:05:41.030> hook<00:05:41.210> the

orange into the white to get just on of
course<00:05:53.150> black<00:05:53.690> is<00:05:53.720> your<00:05:54.140> ground<00:05:54.440> and<00:05:55.240> the

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 
course black is your ground and the

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.540 
course black is your ground and the
switch<00:05:56.480> I<00:05:56.630> use<00:05:56.900> designed<00:05:57.500> to<00:05:57.800> ground<00:05:58.190> to

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:58.550 
switch I use designed to ground to

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:07.350 
switch I use designed to ground to
activate<00:05:59.120> so<00:05:59.420> I<00:05:59.450> used<00:05:59.750> relays<00:06:00.910> and<00:06:04.840> the<00:06:05.840> 85

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 
activate so I used relays and the 85

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.390 
activate so I used relays and the 85
pole<00:06:08.360> on<00:06:08.570> a<00:06:08.600> relay<00:06:09.080> will<00:06:09.500> activate<00:06:09.980> it<00:06:10.160> if<00:06:10.280> you

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 
pole on a relay will activate it if you

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.710 
pole on a relay will activate it if you
ground<00:06:10.670> it<00:06:10.880> if<00:06:11.000> you<00:06:11.150> supply<00:06:11.450> power<00:06:12.250> to<00:06:13.510> 87<00:06:14.510> and

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:14.720 
ground it if you supply power to 87 and

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:19.210 
ground it if you supply power to 87 and
86<00:06:16.300> so<00:06:17.300> that's<00:06:17.480> how<00:06:17.600> I<00:06:17.630> did<00:06:17.870> that<00:06:18.050> you<00:06:18.770> may<00:06:18.950> want

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:19.220 
86 so that's how I did that you may want

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:20.740 
86 so that's how I did that you may want
to<00:06:19.250> use<00:06:19.400> a<00:06:19.430> different<00:06:19.880> type<00:06:20.240> of<00:06:20.270> switch<00:06:20.540> on

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:20.750 
to use a different type of switch on

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.560 
to use a different type of switch on
