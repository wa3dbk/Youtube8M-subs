00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.170
 good evening here I am at the controls of a 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.170
 strong couple 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:15.770
 the ong against the hands I have a guild 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.110
 starfire 5 so 5 so like the 4 that's 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.270
 to say with both cases towey 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:22.760
 immediately recognizable but with 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.340
 a big bih plus and then a master 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.170
 original volume in 67 so they 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.039
 were putting master volume here which 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.449
 is not more con besides a 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.279
 ultimately rather than having to spend 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.050
 under bixby to access settings 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.580
 but hey it's not like we bought 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.190
 his guitar gold for his practicality 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:39.110
 it's just that it sounds death and 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.750
 that she is absolutely beautiful for 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.760
 plug in all ages and so a love 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.360
 pedals history to have anyway 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:52.460
 its a little krejci style twin tweed and 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:54.799
 then a verb vibrator of 64 which is of a 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.229
 absolute cleanliness and as you go 

00:00:54.799 --> 00:01:00.760
 able to hear it that sounds like a 

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:00.760
 big cat by the fire 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.050
 e 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.860
