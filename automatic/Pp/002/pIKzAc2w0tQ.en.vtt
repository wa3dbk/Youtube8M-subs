00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.959 

mmm

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:42.969 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:47.229 

that's<00:00:43.969> a<00:00:44.180> fantastic<00:00:44.660> little<00:00:44.989> car<00:00:45.940> it<00:00:46.940> reminds

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
that's a fantastic little car it reminds

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:49.000 
that's a fantastic little car it reminds
me<00:00:47.420> of<00:00:47.510> the<00:00:47.570> days<00:00:47.750> when<00:00:48.019> I<00:00:48.109> was<00:00:48.230> racing<00:00:48.680> I<00:00:48.800> from

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
me of the days when I was racing I from

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.700 
me of the days when I was racing I from
wheelers<00:00:49.460> and<00:00:49.870> I<00:00:50.870> reckon<00:00:51.379> it's<00:00:51.500> going<00:00:51.649> to

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
wheelers and I reckon it's going to

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.529 
wheelers and I reckon it's going to
produce<00:00:51.829> some<00:00:52.219> pretty<00:00:52.430> exciting<00:00:52.760> racing<00:00:53.390> as

00:00:53.529 --> 00:00:53.539 
produce some pretty exciting racing as

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:55.360 
produce some pretty exciting racing as
well<00:00:53.750> it's<00:00:54.469> got<00:00:54.589> a<00:00:54.620> great<00:00:54.859> amount<00:00:55.250> of

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
well it's got a great amount of

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.040 
well it's got a great amount of
mechanical<00:00:55.969> grip<00:00:56.149> and<00:00:56.420> obviously<00:00:56.690> that<00:00:56.750> arrow

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
mechanical grip and obviously that arrow

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.009 
mechanical grip and obviously that arrow
as<00:00:57.320> well<00:00:57.589> which<00:00:57.829> that<00:00:58.820> entry-level<00:00:59.180> national

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:00.019 
as well which that entry-level national

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:03.490 
as well which that entry-level national
category<00:01:00.680> has<00:01:00.890> sort<00:01:01.399> of<00:01:01.430> lacked<00:01:02.199> with<00:01:03.199> with

formula<00:01:03.949> forward<00:01:04.339> but<00:01:04.810> now<00:01:05.810> I<00:01:05.840> really<00:01:06.320> enjoyed

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
formula forward but now I really enjoyed

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.289

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
it you know they're going to refine it a

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:09.460 
it you know they're going to refine it a
little<00:01:08.330> bit<00:01:08.659> and<00:01:08.810> it's<00:01:08.960> obviously<00:01:09.200> the<00:01:09.320> first

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
little bit and it's obviously the first

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:10.930 
little bit and it's obviously the first
one<00:01:09.740> in<00:01:09.860> the<00:01:09.920> world<00:01:10.130> so<00:01:10.430> there's<00:01:10.640> going<00:01:10.820> to<00:01:10.880> be
