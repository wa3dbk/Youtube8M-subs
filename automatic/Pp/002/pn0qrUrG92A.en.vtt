00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
chapter 13 Jesus Washington is a

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.490 
chapter 13 Jesus Washington is a
disciple<00:04:21.359> speak<00:04:21.780> now<00:04:21.959> this<00:04:22.109> was<00:04:22.290> a<00:04:22.320> little

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
disciple speak now this was a little

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.070 
disciple speak now this was a little
harder<00:04:22.890> but<00:04:23.250> I<00:04:23.310> think<00:04:23.640> when<00:04:23.820> you<00:04:23.940> really<00:04:24.390> spend

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
harder but I think when you really spend

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.690 
harder but I think when you really spend
time<00:04:25.260> what<00:04:25.620> the<00:04:25.770> number<00:04:25.980> might<00:04:26.160> be<00:04:26.190> you'll

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
time what the number might be you'll

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.480 
time what the number might be you'll
come<00:04:27.180> up<00:04:27.210> with<00:04:27.360> some<00:04:27.750> great<00:04:27.900> ideas<00:04:27.960> but<00:04:28.560> I

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
come up with some great ideas but I

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.670 
come up with some great ideas but I
decided<00:04:29.850> to<00:04:30.060> make<00:04:30.210> those<00:04:30.360> big<00:04:30.600> toes<00:04:30.870> so<00:04:31.380> if<00:04:31.530> you

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
decided to make those big toes so if you

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.670 
decided to make those big toes so if you
can<00:04:31.830> see<00:04:32.430> the<00:04:32.580> big<00:04:32.760> toes<00:04:33.060> Jesus<00:04:34.020> Washington's

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
can see the big toes Jesus Washington's

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.110 
can see the big toes Jesus Washington's
disciples<00:04:35.340> feet<00:04:36.440> John<00:04:37.440> chapter<00:04:37.860> 14<00:04:38.370> talks

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
disciples feet John chapter 14 talks

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.780 
disciples feet John chapter 14 talks
about<00:04:39.390> Jesus<00:04:39.600> says<00:04:40.020> I<00:04:40.200> must<00:04:40.410> go<00:04:41.250> to<00:04:41.310> prepare<00:04:41.610> a

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790 
about Jesus says I must go to prepare a

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.890 
about Jesus says I must go to prepare a
place<00:04:42.500> my<00:04:43.500> father's<00:04:44.160> house<00:04:44.400> are<00:04:44.610> many<00:04:44.669> rooms

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
place my father's house are many rooms

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.850 
place my father's house are many rooms
and<00:04:45.900> so<00:04:46.169> John<00:04:46.980> chapter<00:04:47.400> 14<00:04:48.050> one<00:04:49.050> will<00:04:49.260> be<00:04:49.380> Jesus

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
and so John chapter 14 one will be Jesus

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.750 
and so John chapter 14 one will be Jesus
and<00:04:50.070> four<00:04:50.970> will<00:04:51.390> be<00:04:51.540> if<00:04:51.960> you<00:04:52.080> can<00:04:52.200> see<00:04:52.440> the<00:04:52.760> the

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
and four will be if you can see the the

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.420 
and four will be if you can see the the
four<00:04:54.030> looks<00:04:54.330> like<00:04:54.570> the<00:04:54.960> roof<00:04:55.169> of<00:04:55.410> a<00:04:55.500> house<00:04:55.710> and

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
four looks like the roof of a house and

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.400 
four looks like the roof of a house and
so<00:04:56.700> it'll<00:04:57.300> make<00:04:57.480> us<00:04:57.690> know

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
so it'll make us know

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:04.220 
so it'll make us know
think<00:04:58.950> that<00:04:59.390> that<00:05:00.680> the<00:05:01.680> father's<00:05:02.280> house<00:05:03.230> John

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:04.230 
think that that the father's house John

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:08.480 
think that that the father's house John
chapter<00:05:04.650> 15<00:05:04.800> Jesus<00:05:06.320> says<00:05:07.320> I'm<00:05:07.800> divined<00:05:08.220> and

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
chapter 15 Jesus says I'm divined and

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.130 
chapter 15 Jesus says I'm divined and
you're<00:05:08.610> the<00:05:08.730> branches<00:05:09.210> and<00:05:09.570> whoever<00:05:09.900> doesn't

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:10.140 
you're the branches and whoever doesn't

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:11.990 
you're the branches and whoever doesn't
bear<00:05:10.410> fruit<00:05:10.440> will<00:05:10.950> be<00:05:10.980> cut<00:05:11.100> off<00:05:11.400> by<00:05:11.610> the<00:05:11.670> father

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
bear fruit will be cut off by the father

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.970 
bear fruit will be cut off by the father
so<00:05:12.450> when<00:05:13.290> we<00:05:13.440> make<00:05:13.650> John<00:05:13.980> chapter<00:05:14.400> 15<00:05:15.770> 1<00:05:16.770> will

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:16.980 
so when we make John chapter 15 1 will

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.390 
so when we make John chapter 15 1 will
be<00:05:17.100> Jesus<00:05:17.610> and<00:05:17.880> 5<00:05:18.510> would<00:05:18.840> be<00:05:18.950> if<00:05:19.950> you<00:05:20.100> could<00:05:20.250> see

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
be Jesus and 5 would be if you could see

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.490 
be Jesus and 5 would be if you could see
the<00:05:20.520> grape<00:05:20.790> or<00:05:21.030> some<00:05:21.630> type<00:05:21.840> of<00:05:22.020> fruit<00:05:22.290> and

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
the grape or some type of fruit and

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.240 
the grape or some type of fruit and
there's<00:05:22.710> a<00:05:22.830> fine<00:05:23.070> so<00:05:23.940> it'll<00:05:24.180> make<00:05:24.300> us<00:05:24.480> think<00:05:24.720> of

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
there's a fine so it'll make us think of

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:32.050 
there's a fine so it'll make us think of
the<00:05:26.250> bump<00:05:27.590> and<00:05:28.590> that<00:05:29.370> John<00:05:29.670> chapter<00:05:30.180> 16<00:05:30.800> Jesus

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.060 
the bump and that John chapter 16 Jesus

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.970 
the bump and that John chapter 16 Jesus
says<00:05:33.060> I<00:05:33.360> must<00:05:33.570> go<00:05:33.750> for<00:05:34.110> the<00:05:34.320> helper<00:05:34.620> to<00:05:34.770> come

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:34.980 
says I must go for the helper to come

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.250 
says I must go for the helper to come
and<00:05:35.340> we<00:05:36.120> know<00:05:36.270> that<00:05:36.420> helper<00:05:36.780> is<00:05:36.900> the<00:05:37.050> Holy

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:37.260 
and we know that helper is the Holy

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.490 
and we know that helper is the Holy
Spirit<00:05:37.380> and<00:05:38.220> what's<00:05:38.820> another<00:05:39.110> word<00:05:40.110> for<00:05:40.170> Holy

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 
Spirit and what's another word for Holy

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.110 
Spirit and what's another word for Holy
Spirit<00:05:40.920> and<00:05:41.040> Holy<00:05:41.130> Ghost<00:05:41.310> was<00:05:41.760> an<00:05:41.880> old<00:05:42.000> English

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
Spirit and Holy Ghost was an old English

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.200 
Spirit and Holy Ghost was an old English
word<00:05:42.360> and<00:05:43.020> so<00:05:43.290> we'll<00:05:43.500> make<00:05:43.650> the<00:05:43.860> six<00:05:44.220> look<00:05:45.030> like

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
word and so we'll make the six look like

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.330 
word and so we'll make the six look like
a<00:05:45.240> ghost<00:05:45.630> coming<00:05:46.140> down<00:05:46.350> and<00:05:46.860> they<00:05:47.010> should<00:05:47.190> make

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
a ghost coming down and they should make

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.280 
a ghost coming down and they should make
it<00:05:47.490> to<00:05:47.730> help<00:05:47.940> us<00:05:48.090> think<00:05:48.330> about<00:05:48.450> the<00:05:48.720> ghost<00:05:48.960> and

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:49.290 
it to help us think about the ghost and

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:52.390 
it to help us think about the ghost and
then<00:05:49.410> of<00:05:49.620> course<00:05:49.650> number<00:05:50.130> one<00:05:50.460> will<00:05:51.000> be<00:05:51.090> Jesus

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:52.400 
then of course number one will be Jesus

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:58.040 
then of course number one will be Jesus
number<00:05:53.400> 17<00:05:54.030> chapter<00:05:54.540> 17<00:05:54.960> of<00:05:55.050> John<00:05:55.410> is<00:05:57.050> Jesus
