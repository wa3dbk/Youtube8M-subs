00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.540
 anything 

00:00:22.649 --> 00:00:25.649
 but 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.310
 Well 

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.180
 no 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.530
 yesterday from the hard test almost always 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.790
 fair compromise between vital instinct 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.980
 despair but now that I can't find anymore 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.900
 the same one with the concert too hard 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.970
 to swallow it must be repressed I don't even know 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.070
 what I think is the fear of looking at me 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.010
 inside saner point the finger from others 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.210
 I'm not understanding what I'm waiting for 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.770
 subordination the scenario makes is not there 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.840
 nothing objective starts the car 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.760
 belief all loses a direct the 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.890
 my down how do i trace the 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.690
 my path if I don't know where they come from and 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.790
 where i 'm going in fashion takes away the 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.940
 courage costs you run to the faith 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.350
 that there I'm getting too little 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.450
 we distinguish good and evil for 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.310
 to focus on a paranormal reality 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.259
 that maniacal instinct that we have a 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.300
 to everyone with absurd preconceptions 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:24.640
 s.remo take notes because I do 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.080
 always with the brain most is not that 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.180
 does not already have a distinct we have a 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.280
 instinct a little more complicated 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.050
 you think like me to make sense of it to you 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.180
 your life you say you 've decided everything 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.070
 generate explain why because there is not 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.860
 I understand if we need to look for why 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.200
 of things all my power 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.390
 decision-making I would not like the frame 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.370
 understand this life must chaplain la 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.500
 cessation of suffering and alone 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.750
 postponement if then returns but double 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.150
 of gaetano I want to look tired so much 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.400
 for the soul just an unwise way to 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.260
 make it less tragic than it is 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.390
 buy remains a practice you have studied 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.610
 well, you can easily associate it with the 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.680
 practice was that you do it with fund the 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.960
 concept of willpower with genes 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.420
 potential but there I don't understand bank 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.979
 cisco see if I feel bad about any material 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.050
 can be enough if a relationship 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.910
 interpersonal can get to fill the 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.010
 gap that is between my knowledge 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.630
 state of mind I am in the middle of one 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.170
 I don't want a permanent crisis 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.300
 surrender 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.220
 a process that cannot suspend 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.319
 rest in the depravity of a cycle 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.030
 vital that between more or less evolved expenses 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:28.209
 and almost double spur mara says 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.400
 artificial I remain in the chaos to stay in 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.290
 peace incompatible with surviving the 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.300
 what spiritual journey you do not say 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.870
 rational that is then left inside a 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.280
 empty at sea 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.230
 and now that with the axis I go to 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.239
 little arm I'm just like a dog at 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.129
 his presence will do with the spice 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:47.409
 whose heads you can slip it all 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:47.409
 he is sure and he does not have it ok 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.300
 no
