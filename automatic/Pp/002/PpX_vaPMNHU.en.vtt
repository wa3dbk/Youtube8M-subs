00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
it was Bank one was running lean

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:15.280 
it was Bank one was running lean
possible<00:02:11.020> vacuum<00:02:12.020> leak<00:02:12.320> and<00:02:13.600> it<00:02:14.600> was<00:02:14.810> a<00:02:14.840> had<00:02:15.260> a

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
possible vacuum leak and it was a had a

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.070 
possible vacuum leak and it was a had a
vacuum<00:02:15.740> leak<00:02:15.980> I<00:02:16.190> fixed<00:02:16.520> that<00:02:16.780> service<00:02:17.780> engine

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
vacuum leak I fixed that service engine

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.010 
vacuum leak I fixed that service engine
soon<00:02:18.110> light<00:02:18.680> did<00:02:19.100> not<00:02:19.130> go<00:02:19.490> off<00:02:19.700> it'll<00:02:20.660> go<00:02:20.840> off

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
soon light did not go off it'll go off

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.660 
soon light did not go off it'll go off
and<00:02:21.200> then<00:02:21.290> come<00:02:21.440> back<00:02:21.470> on<00:02:22.240> so<00:02:24.370> also<00:02:25.370> there's<00:02:25.610> a

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
and then come back on so also there's a

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.040 
and then come back on so also there's a
tiny<00:02:26.120> amount<00:02:26.630> of<00:02:26.900> antifreeze<00:02:27.770> under<00:02:28.640> the<00:02:29.050> old

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
tiny amount of antifreeze under the old

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.590 
tiny amount of antifreeze under the old
cap<00:02:30.440> I<00:02:30.770> mean<00:02:31.130> it's<00:02:31.280> a<00:02:31.370> tiny<00:02:31.610> amount<00:02:32.030> just<00:02:32.480> to

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
cap I mean it's a tiny amount just to

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.490 
cap I mean it's a tiny amount just to
drop<00:02:32.930> maybe<00:02:33.410> here<00:02:33.770> and<00:02:33.800> there<00:02:34.270> but<00:02:35.500> it's

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
drop maybe here and there but it's

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.190 
drop maybe here and there but it's
enough<00:02:36.830> to<00:02:36.860> worry<00:02:37.130> me<00:02:37.400> that<00:02:37.610> I<00:02:37.870> really<00:02:38.870> got<00:02:39.050> to

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
enough to worry me that I really got to

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.490 
enough to worry me that I really got to
change<00:02:39.440> the<00:02:39.800> intake<00:02:40.340> gasket<00:02:40.730> on<00:02:40.880> it<00:02:41.230> it<00:02:42.230> still

has<00:02:42.530> the<00:02:43.720> plastic<00:02:44.720> intake<00:02:45.470> gasket<00:02:45.950> which<00:02:46.190> is

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
has the plastic intake gasket which is

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:30.099 
the lead foot so but anyway as you can

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:32.039 
the lead foot so but anyway as you can
see<00:03:30.310> it<00:03:30.489> needs<00:03:30.670> it<00:03:31.000> needs<00:03:31.030> a<00:03:31.269> few<00:03:31.420> things<00:03:31.720> the

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
see it needs it needs a few things the

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:34.500

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
conditioned those so they got a little

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.369 
conditioned those so they got a little
bit<00:03:44.709> hard<00:03:45.010> here<00:03:45.310> and<00:03:45.430> there<00:03:45.900> so<00:03:46.900> I'm<00:03:47.140> going<00:03:47.319> to

00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:47.379 
bit hard here and there so I'm going to

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:50.509 
bit hard here and there so I'm going to
try<00:03:47.530> to<00:03:47.560> replace<00:03:47.860> those<00:03:48.220> or<00:03:48.579> reupholster<00:03:49.299> them

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
try to replace those or reupholster them

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:56.520 
try to replace those or reupholster them
but<00:03:51.519> I<00:03:53.129> really<00:03:54.129> like<00:03:54.310> the<00:03:54.430> car<00:03:55.140> as<00:03:56.140> you<00:03:56.290> can<00:03:56.409> see

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
but I really like the car as you can see

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.699 
but I really like the car as you can see
here<00:03:56.769> it<00:03:56.859> needs<00:03:57.040> a<00:03:57.129> few<00:03:57.280> little<00:03:57.790> odds<00:03:57.940> and<00:03:58.180> ends

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
here it needs a few little odds and ends

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.940 
here it needs a few little odds and ends
nothing<00:03:59.709> real<00:03:59.890> serious<00:04:00.099> it<00:04:00.579> has<00:04:00.639> the<00:04:01.239> oh<00:04:01.950> I'm

has<00:04:03.519> the<00:04:04.560> the<00:04:05.560> web<00:04:06.010> design<00:04:06.370> wheels<00:04:06.670> on<00:04:06.940> it

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
has the the web design wheels on it

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:11.809 
has the the web design wheels on it
which<00:04:09.579> I<00:04:09.909> really<00:04:10.150> don't<00:04:10.510> care<00:04:10.810> for<00:04:10.870> honestly<00:04:11.440> I

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
which I really don't care for honestly I

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:14.490 
which I really don't care for honestly I
think<00:04:12.819> it's<00:04:13.120> probably<00:04:13.599> the<00:04:13.750> worst<00:04:13.959> looking

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
think it's probably the worst looking

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.620 
think it's probably the worst looking
wheel<00:04:15.010> they<00:04:15.250> ever<00:04:15.430> made<00:04:15.730> for<00:04:15.909> these<00:04:16.060> cars<00:04:16.329> I

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
that I don't get knocked in my motor and

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:14.710 
that I don't get knocked in my motor and
chip<00:05:10.370> a<00:05:10.460> piston<00:05:11.080> so<00:05:12.190> as<00:05:13.190> you<00:05:13.340> can<00:05:13.430> see<00:05:13.540> that<00:05:14.540> is

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 
chip a piston so as you can see that is

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.090 
chip a piston so as you can see that is
one<00:05:14.990> big<00:05:15.560> pulley<00:05:15.860> that's<00:05:16.790> a<00:05:16.910> four<00:05:17.180> inch<00:05:17.389> pulley

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 
one big pulley that's a four inch pulley

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.950 
one big pulley that's a four inch pulley
so<00:05:19.100> any<00:05:19.460> as<00:05:19.610> you<00:05:19.729> can<00:05:19.880> see<00:05:19.970> also<00:05:20.150> it<00:05:20.510> still<00:05:20.720> has

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
so any as you can see also it still has

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:27.730 
so any as you can see also it still has
the<00:05:22.030> plastic<00:05:24.970> GM<00:05:25.970> OAM<00:05:26.810> gasket<00:05:27.320> on<00:05:27.470> it<00:05:27.620> which

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
the plastic GM OAM gasket on it which

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.710 
the plastic GM OAM gasket on it which
needs<00:05:27.979> to<00:05:28.040> be<00:05:28.130> replaced<00:05:29.139> as<00:05:30.139> you<00:05:30.320> see<00:05:30.530> here

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:31.720 
needs to be replaced as you see here

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.939 
needs to be replaced as you see here
