00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.009
 hello everyone and welcome to a new 

00:00:02.549 --> 00:00:06.749
 video here in tgn in spanish my name 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.790
 is neo and today we will talk about 

00:00:06.749 --> 00:00:12.470
 some pretty popular animes that 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.470
 they should have their own video game 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.410
 in recent years we have been able 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.970
 enjoy several animated series that 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.310
 they have been very successful on television 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.200
 and at some point we have wanted to see them 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.550
 turned into video games that's why 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.739
 that in this count I will focus on the 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.270
 most popular and great animes that I 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.640
 like to have your own version in 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.170
 Home or portable console should be clarified 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.940
 that in this video I will only focus on 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.800
 the animated series and I will treat those 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.840
 that have not received a game outside of 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.309
 Japan in our region in the west 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.730
 we would also like to see this kind of 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:47.730
 Titles 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.280
 let's start this count with one of the 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.440
 classic animes of action legend of the 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.180
 galactic and balls this animated series already 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.830
 has some games on the market 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.660
 although all of them are strategy in 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.340
 real time they will see a high number of 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.110
 spacecraft execute several 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.330
 attack formations and exterminating 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.860
 various enemies, you always have to 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.870
 be aware of resources and 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.730
 ships available however I think that 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.140
 could be exploited better the series 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.729
 could integrate one more story 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.620
 deep that combines the elements 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.720
 political and economic issues that the 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.910
 fair as a rpg maybe these 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.410
 elements already existed but as you were 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.410
 to see everything is in Japanese 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.290
 helsinn occupies the next position in the 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.360
 list this scary anime could be 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.460
 adapted almost perfectly to a 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.800
 slash hack that combines elements of 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.360
 third-person vision if I know that 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.550
 it sounds like an alternate version of 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.560
 devil may cry but I think there's the 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.870
 formula of success as picasso 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.420
 said good artists copied the 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.790
 big artists do not go helsing has 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.680
 more mature dark characters and that 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.600
 they could intertwine stories within 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.760
 the same game I would enjoy playing a lot 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.950
 a more bloody version with more word 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:02.240
 Vampires and memorable characters like 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.240
 those that appear in helsing 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.360
 with a game based on black lagoon 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.520
 we could get to the edge of madness 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.680
 this anime has nuns and gothic 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.349
 psychotic pirates psychotic killers 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.630
 all absolutely all the characters 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:18.640
 they're crazy and the best thing is that 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.620
 they are locked in the same island 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.690
 developers can not lose everything 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.430
 that potential could create a sandbox 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.440
 totally focused on the destruction 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.569
 the extravagant missions and the 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.760
 murders in shootings and persecutions 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:34.110
 almost infinite it would be like a version 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.110
 improved gta 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.190
 I came back pop is in the second place that 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.050
 it's one of my favorite series and that 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.180
 better would be in a video game his 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.740
 history of old this intergalactic what 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.840
 becomes a serious candidate for 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.250
 have their own adaptation in consoles 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.830
 I think the perfect study for this 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.780
 work would be telltale games they have 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.850
 proven to have almost master control 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.010
 of the narrative of their games plus their 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.870
 atmosphere is very peculiar and is very 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.760
 well achieved an extra detail is that 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.190
 I was in combining all these elements 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.470
 with the action out the bebop meets 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.060
 all those requirements only remain 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.530
 wait to have a courageous study that 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.530
 dare to bring the game to life 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:17.489
 finally we reached the first place of 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.530
 this count where we find to see 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.450
 be the anime that can be considered 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.550
 a worthy representative of the action the 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.110
 cap and blood several years ago a 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.849
 first game was released in the sega 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.620
 dreamcast and subsequently one in 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:30.450
 playstation 2 that remained exclusive 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.220
 from japan also tablet mind none 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.200
 met the expectations I think 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.030
 see being needs a style similar to 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.830
 dark souls in which we face the 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.019
 enemies monsters and creatures more 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.640
 representative of the series however 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.650
 should take direct elements of 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.450
 games like god of war iii darksiders 2 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.280
 to make it more fluid fast and 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.200
 surprising to the view of the player and 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.910
 especially having a long story 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.160
 more controlled and developed 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.230
 according to the actions in combat the 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.640
 anime has endearing characters that 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.740
 they could easily gain an important 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.780
 place in this industry 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.250
 these are just some of the animes that 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.290
 I would like to see adapted to a 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.060
 video game it was very difficult to choose just 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.650
 five but I hope some will turn 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.630
 reality that another anime would include 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.370
 you on this list share your 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.140
 opinions in the comments here is 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:18.000
 dismisses neo and see you in the next 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.000
 tgn video in Spanish
