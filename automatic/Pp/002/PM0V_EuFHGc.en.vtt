00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.630 
little while I think he goes you know
sort<00:01:55.159> of<00:01:55.220> volleying<00:01:56.000> in<00:01:56.270> between<00:01:56.720> sort<00:01:57.079> of

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
sort of volleying in between sort of

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.389 
sort of volleying in between sort of
struggling<00:01:58.640> to<00:01:58.819> be<00:01:59.000> good<00:01:59.780> and<00:02:00.020> just<00:02:00.350> and<00:02:00.799> moral

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
struggling to be good and just and moral

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:06.249 
struggling to be good and just and moral
and<00:02:02.079> the<00:02:04.299> inexorably<00:02:05.299> fighting<00:02:05.929> what<00:02:06.140> he

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
and the inexorably fighting what he

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:08.889 
and the inexorably fighting what he
really<00:02:06.470> is<00:02:06.590> which<00:02:07.100> is<00:02:07.280> sort<00:02:07.640> of<00:02:07.700> immoral<00:02:08.660> and

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
really is which is sort of immoral and

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.360 
really is which is sort of immoral and
unjust<00:02:09.819> and<00:02:10.819> so<00:02:11.560> it's<00:02:12.560> that<00:02:12.799> volley<00:02:13.099> in

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
unjust and so it's that volley in

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.660 
unjust and so it's that volley in
between<00:02:13.760> and<00:02:14.560> it's<00:02:15.560> it's<00:02:15.860> going<00:02:16.040> to<00:02:16.130> be<00:02:16.310> it's<00:02:16.549> a

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
between and it's it's going to be it's a

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.250 
between and it's it's going to be it's a
lot<00:02:16.790> of<00:02:16.880> fun<00:02:17.030> but<00:02:19.630> Damon<00:02:20.630> goes<00:02:20.810> down<00:02:20.989> one<00:02:21.170> of

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
lot of fun but Damon goes down one of

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.410 
lot of fun but Damon goes down one of
his<00:02:21.380> paths<00:02:21.830> I<00:02:22.250> think<00:02:22.489> pretty<00:02:22.670> soon<00:02:22.790> despite

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420

his paths I think pretty soon despite
virtue<00:02:23.569> of<00:02:23.660> the<00:02:23.750> fact<00:02:23.810> of<00:02:24.019> everything<00:02:24.319> that's

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
virtue of the fact of everything that's

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.620 
virtue of the fact of everything that's
going<00:02:24.739> on<00:02:24.860> you<00:02:25.610> know<00:02:25.730> there's<00:02:25.910> only<00:02:26.090> there
