00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
you can see a little the little of the

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:48.670 
you can see a little the little of the
juice<00:02:45.200> floating<00:02:45.620> around<00:02:45.680> in<00:02:45.950> there<00:02:47.500> so<00:02:48.500> let's

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
juice floating around in there so let's

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.960 
juice floating around in there so let's
get<00:02:48.800> that<00:02:49.900> sniff<00:02:51.220> not<00:02:52.220> doesn't<00:02:52.640> really<00:02:52.670> have<00:02:52.940> a

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
get that sniff not doesn't really have a

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.300 
get that sniff not doesn't really have a
lot<00:02:53.120> of<00:02:53.150> smell<00:02:53.420> a<00:02:53.950> little<00:02:54.950> bit<00:02:55.069> a<00:02:55.190> little

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
lot of smell a little bit a little

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:05.020 
lot of smell a little bit a little
Midori<00:02:55.670> in<00:02:55.790> there<00:03:02.560> mmm<00:03:03.620> it<00:03:03.680> is<00:03:03.799> weird<00:03:04.030> because

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
Midori in there mmm it is weird because

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.690 
Midori in there mmm it is weird because
both<00:03:05.390> have<00:03:05.540> the<00:03:05.660> sweetness<00:03:05.959> you're<00:03:06.079> gonna<00:03:06.170> get

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
both have the sweetness you're gonna get

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.710 
both have the sweetness you're gonna get
predominantly<00:03:07.700> sweet<00:03:08.390> drink<00:03:10.060> that's<00:03:11.060> crazy

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
predominantly sweet drink that's crazy

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.940 
predominantly sweet drink that's crazy
we<00:03:12.590> missed<00:03:12.829> it<00:03:13.190> but<00:03:13.880> really<00:03:14.150> I'm<00:03:14.239> getting<00:03:14.950> the

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
we missed it but really I'm getting the

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.360 
we missed it but really I'm getting the
amaretto<00:03:16.630> first<00:03:17.630> really<00:03:18.170> a<00:03:18.200> good<00:03:18.620> sense<00:03:19.250> of

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
amaretto first really a good sense of

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.190 
amaretto first really a good sense of
amaretto<00:03:19.670> followed<00:03:20.299> by<00:03:20.540> the<00:03:20.600> Midori<00:03:21.019> it

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
amaretto followed by the Midori it

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.380 
amaretto followed by the Midori it
didn't<00:03:21.500> really<00:03:21.829> mix<00:03:22.220> like<00:03:23.000> I<00:03:23.150> thought<00:03:23.329> it

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
didn't really mix like I thought it

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.270 
didn't really mix like I thought it
would<00:03:23.510> I<00:03:23.660> guess<00:03:23.900> maybe<00:03:24.109> your<00:03:24.620> taste<00:03:25.010> buds

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
would I guess maybe your taste buds

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.560 
would I guess maybe your taste buds
could<00:03:25.489> separate<00:03:25.910> them<00:03:26.060> both<00:03:26.239> as<00:03:26.450> they're

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
could separate them both as they're

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.110 
could separate them both as they're
going<00:03:26.810> down<00:03:26.959> not<00:03:27.859> very<00:03:28.100> sour<00:03:28.370> so<00:03:28.670> just<00:03:29.060> a

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
going down not very sour so just a

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.849 
going down not very sour so just a
little<00:03:29.239> little<00:03:29.720> little<00:03:30.049> amount<00:03:30.590> of<00:03:30.650> sour

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:30.859 
little little little amount of sour

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:32.020 
little little little amount of sour
probably<00:03:31.250> just<00:03:31.400> to<00:03:31.519> really<00:03:31.700> bring<00:03:31.940> them

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
probably just to really bring them

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.440 
probably just to really bring them
together

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
together

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.090 
together
I'm<00:03:32.660> not<00:03:32.900> chemist<00:03:33.290> who<00:03:33.380> created<00:03:33.680> the<00:03:33.769> drink<00:03:34.010> so

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
I'm not chemist who created the drink so

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.360 
I'm not chemist who created the drink so
I<00:03:34.160> don't<00:03:34.310> know<00:03:34.370> but<00:03:34.989> overall<00:03:35.989> I<00:03:36.320> was<00:03:36.829> afraid<00:03:37.070> I

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
I don't know but overall I was afraid I

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:38.500 
I don't know but overall I was afraid I
thought<00:03:37.579> it<00:03:37.670> was<00:03:37.760> gonna<00:03:37.850> kind<00:03:38.030> of<00:03:38.180> taste<00:03:38.390> a

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
thought it was gonna kind of taste a

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.300 
thought it was gonna kind of taste a
little<00:03:38.660> disjointed<00:03:39.140> or<00:03:39.650> funny<00:03:39.890> or<00:03:40.100> whatever

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
little disjointed or funny or whatever

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.940 
little disjointed or funny or whatever
but<00:03:40.640> it<00:03:40.730> it<00:03:41.359> worked<00:03:41.570> well<00:03:41.870> together<00:03:42.079> because

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
but it it worked well together because

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:44.860 
but it it worked well together because
it<00:03:43.100> almost<00:03:43.250> wasn't<00:03:44.000> together<00:03:44.150> even<00:03:44.660> though<00:03:44.750> it

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
it almost wasn't together even though it

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.949 
it almost wasn't together even though it
was<00:03:45.019> mixed<00:03:45.530> in<00:03:45.709> the<00:03:45.920> drink<00:03:46.390> can<00:03:47.390> somebody<00:03:47.630> pick

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
was mixed in the drink can somebody pick

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:49.509 
was mixed in the drink can somebody pick
it<00:03:48.109> out<00:03:48.260> I<00:03:48.380> would<00:03:48.560> say<00:03:48.709> if<00:03:48.829> you<00:03:48.920> gave<00:03:49.130> this<00:03:49.280> shot

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
it out I would say if you gave this shot

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:50.740 
it out I would say if you gave this shot
that<00:03:49.549> somebody<00:03:49.910> had<00:03:50.150> them<00:03:50.329> picked<00:03:50.540> the

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
that somebody had them picked the

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.380 
that somebody had them picked the
alcohols<00:03:51.200> somebody<00:03:52.010> who's<00:03:52.160> an<00:03:52.310> amaretto<00:03:52.760> fan
