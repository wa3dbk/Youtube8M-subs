00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
me doing a speedrun in this game would

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.710 
me doing a speedrun in this game would
be<00:00:40.980> nearly<00:00:41.370> impossible

rocket car back as you can see some of

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.450 
rocket car back as you can see some of
the<00:00:59.300> Pikmin<00:00:59.780> actually<00:01:00.140> have<00:01:00.380> little<00:01:00.800> bulbs<00:01:01.280> on

the Pikmin actually have little bulbs on
the<00:01:01.580> head<00:01:03.460> basically<00:01:04.460> if<00:01:04.580> you<00:01:04.730> leave<00:01:04.910> a<00:01:04.940> Pikmin

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:05.480 
the head basically if you leave a Pikmin

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.230 
the head basically if you leave a Pikmin
underground<00:01:06.110> for<00:01:06.440> a<00:01:06.470> while<00:01:06.680> all<00:01:07.010> their<00:01:07.970> leaves

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
underground for a while all their leaves

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.210 
underground for a while all their leaves
will<00:01:08.570> start<00:01:08.840> growing<00:01:09.140> and<00:01:09.530> then<00:01:09.650> like<00:01:09.860> they'll

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
will start growing and then like they'll

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.540 
will start growing and then like they'll
have<00:01:10.370> a<00:01:10.400> bulbs<00:01:11.330> and<00:01:11.570> also<00:01:12.110> have<00:01:12.370> flowers<00:01:13.370> on

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
have a bulbs and also have flowers on

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.610 
have a bulbs and also have flowers on
their<00:01:13.700> head<00:01:14.110> another<00:01:15.110> way<00:01:15.260> you<00:01:15.320> can<00:01:15.470> get

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:15.620 
their head another way you can get

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.260 
their head another way you can get
flowers<00:01:16.070> is<00:01:16.310> by<00:01:16.520> what<00:01:16.790> they're<00:01:16.910> doing<00:01:17.120> right

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
flowers is by what they're doing right

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.870 
flowers is by what they're doing right
now<00:01:17.480> if<00:01:17.660> you<00:01:17.750> find<00:01:17.990> the<00:01:18.080> yellow<00:01:18.200> nectar<00:01:18.880> they

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
now if you find the yellow nectar they

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.270 
now if you find the yellow nectar they
can<00:01:20.030> actually<00:01:20.360> grow<00:01:20.600> their<00:01:20.780> own<00:01:20.810> flowers<00:01:21.410> and

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
can actually grow their own flowers and

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.640 
can actually grow their own flowers and
basically<00:01:23.210> when<00:01:23.450> penguin<00:01:23.780> have<00:01:23.960> flowers<00:01:24.440> on

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
basically when penguin have flowers on

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.230 
basically when penguin have flowers on
their<00:01:24.800> hands<00:01:25.190> they<00:01:25.490> become<00:01:25.790> more<00:01:26.030> productive

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
their hands they become more productive

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.859 
their hands they become more productive
way<00:01:26.840> I<00:01:27.520> think<00:01:28.520> they<00:01:28.640> can<00:01:28.820> fight<00:01:29.119> better<00:01:29.360> they

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
way I think they can fight better they

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.060 
way I think they can fight better they
can<00:01:30.170> like<00:01:30.710> finish<00:01:31.310> tasks<00:01:31.640> or<00:01:32.210> quicker<00:01:32.890> so<00:01:33.890> yeah

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
can like finish tasks or quicker so yeah

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:44.920 
can like finish tasks or quicker so yeah
