00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
first work down that left side of the

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.280 
first work down that left side of the
team<00:02:50.430> try<00:02:51.210> to<00:02:51.270> get<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:51.480> most<00:02:51.630> chemistry<00:02:52.080> and

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
back and then that center mid center mid

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.190 
back and then that center mid center mid
right<00:02:55.830> now<00:02:55.980> is<00:02:56.160> not<00:02:56.340> too<00:02:56.780> not<00:02:57.780> too<00:02:57.840> crucial

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
right now is not too not too crucial

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.720 
right now is not too not too crucial
