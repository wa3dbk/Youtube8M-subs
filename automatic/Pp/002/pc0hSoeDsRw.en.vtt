00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:22.050
 and my loves, everything is good with you today 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:27.450
 I'm going to start a series one more 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:30.960
 Christmas search again and that's it 's 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:33.629
 suggestions of nails and macs pro carnival is 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.580
 I hope you like it so, I will. 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:38.790
 bring colorful ideas with enough 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.890
 shout quite bright because I think 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:46.550
 what is the ped in the carnival né 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:48.809
 So to start in this series of 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.510
 special for the carnival 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.210
 I'll give you this first suggestion that is 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.160
 a big nail 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.920
 I do not know if it will work to see very well. 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:04.080
 but in the photos I think it gives pleasure 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:07.770
 The best is a gradient of red is a 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.890
 late and yellow with glitter on tip in 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.180
 Red is okay I thought it was well 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.970
 cool 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.330
 this is normal because we are right colors 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.310
 warm summer colors and the reader who does not 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.280
 can no longer have 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.159
 so this is my first suggestion 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:29.640
 for the series b 1st nail I intend 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.470
 put at least two more and makeup 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.180
 I'm going to upload it already, I've already recorded a video 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:39.299
 of the makeup and also the local presence is 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:42.750
 one two if I give up 3 but I do not promise 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:45.869
 I'll try to do three lines and two 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:49.080
 Makeup idea was the third also and 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.960
 but I hope you like it and that you 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.939
 comment below that I think you 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.400
 What do you think of the nail? 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:59.460
 of the idea of making nails and max 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.110
 carnival is any expectation of you 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:06.119
 of carnival if you like you 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:08.280
 like anyway is any comment that 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.500
 you have to do on about the video 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.110
 and leave it down here 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.760
 the list of products I will leave in the blog 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.129
 with photo 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.829

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:23.650
 on the short video channel if you 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:26.530
 I liked it and I did not like it down here. 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.140
 and that's it, let 's go the tutorial then 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.930
 to do only one super summer that I'm 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:37.049
 doing here expose carnival I also think 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.049
 that you can use on several occasions 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:45.730
 I passed and I passed a layer 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:50.769
 so to start is I went through one 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:54.519
 called the ana hickmann miniskirt and 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:58.870
 I started doing this with the gradient 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:03:01.510
 Enamel I love color is from 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.870
 collection to super colors and if you want to show 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:08.049
 and I'm going to do it here in the 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:12.159
 little finger to you and remember that you still 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:14.579
 not seen is all on the surface of the whole 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:19.049
 dirty but no problem 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:19.049
 deposit a little product 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:26.250
 take a small piece of washing 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:29.410
 sponge dishwasher and 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:32.910
 running soft beats here in the 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.910
 corner to get the product 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:43.660
 then I come from the far end to 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:45.790
 the top of our tapas not until the 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:49.840
 disappearing enamel 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:53.109
 mixing with the marching yellow 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.910
 I'll do it twice but I will not go either 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:04:01.560
 get more product with just what I was 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:04.510
 right here and I repeat in the process 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:08.530
 with the side that is without product I go 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:11.459
 give one more time, just walk over here to 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:14.349
 get as natural as possible 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:19.590
 It is the appearance of tapping but not 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:23.680
 The next step is to use the 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:28.840
 which is the risqué cinema risqué 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:32.970
 I've never been a saint, it's a pretty red. 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.970
 I'll deposit in the same scheme 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:46.360
 the other sponge loses a little bit and 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:50.529
 smooths until it mixes with 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:57.659
 I just happened to show it from the hole. 

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:57.659
 and I'll repeat on the other one 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:16.510
 So that's what got the end result is 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:19.810
 You can use it like that, and then you just have to 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:24.390
 shiny cover but how is carnival 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:26.470
 I decided to use this little glitter here. 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:28.870
 will not miss 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:34.000
 but it's from the same collection as I 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:38.110
 I bought to make sugar for a 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.960
 here on the surface cloth and 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:43.510
 Then with your own finger I'll tighten 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:46.000
 here comes a little I'm going to do well 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:48.280
 little just in the red portion 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.730
 I'm depositing my finger here with 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:55.810
 soft beats over the serving 

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:59.770
 red that is still wet and 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:04.420
 stay like this with a very smooth 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:07.180
 I'm going to clean it, it 's ready, it's finished. 

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:14.260
 I get the shiny cover and it's just 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:23.650
 spend so without fear can pass 

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:28.240
 up the glitter even good girls then 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:32.380
 this end result is very simple and 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:34.900
 a gradient zin with yellow and red and 

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:37.360
 an intermediate loaf and a little 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:39.730
 client and the tip because you think 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:42.100
 Carnival deserves a lot of glitter right. 

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:45.430
 and I hope you have enjoyed this 

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:47.680

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:50.590
