00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.830 
people get lucky I guess but I just
think<00:02:08.369> that<00:02:08.550> those<00:02:08.819> things<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.420> they<00:02:09.599> say

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
think that those things that they say

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.800 
think that those things that they say
about<00:02:10.050> your<00:02:10.349> kid<00:02:10.590> you<00:02:11.489> know

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
about your kid you know

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.080 
about your kid you know
I<00:02:12.900> think<00:02:13.110> it<00:02:13.230> plays<00:02:13.440> on<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:14.340> emotion<00:02:14.790> that<00:02:14.819> hey

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
I think it plays on the emotion that hey

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.640 
I think it plays on the emotion that hey
my<00:02:15.360> kid<00:02:15.569> could<00:02:15.720> be<00:02:15.810> a<00:02:15.840> star<00:02:16.140> and<00:02:16.319> they<00:02:16.410> spent

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
my kid could be a star and they spent

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:17.900 
my kid could be a star and they spent
all<00:02:16.739> this<00:02:16.830> money<00:02:16.890> I've<00:02:17.190> headshots<00:02:17.640> and<00:02:17.790> all

all this money I've headshots and all

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.320 
all this money I've headshots and all
this<00:02:18.000> other<00:02:18.150> stuff<00:02:18.270> and<00:02:18.780> it<00:02:19.349> never<00:02:19.530> turns<00:02:19.830> out

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
this other stuff and it never turns out

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.880 
this other stuff and it never turns out
obviously<00:02:21.330> you<00:02:21.989> know<00:02:22.080> I<00:02:22.110> did<00:02:22.349> some<00:02:22.560> local
