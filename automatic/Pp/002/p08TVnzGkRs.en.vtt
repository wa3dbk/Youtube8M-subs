differences of the original hyper dunk

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.900 
differences of the original hyper dunk
and<00:01:01.940> the<00:01:02.000> in<00:01:02.360> the<00:01:02.720> outsole<00:01:03.369> the<00:01:04.369> heel<00:01:04.550> cup<00:01:04.759> it's

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:04.910 
and the in the outsole the heel cup it's

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.910 
and the in the outsole the heel cup it's
actually<00:01:05.210> much<00:01:05.570> more<00:01:05.840> on<00:01:06.050> its<00:01:06.350> lower<00:01:06.590> to<00:01:06.800> the

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
actually much more on its lower to the

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.430 
actually much more on its lower to the
ground<00:01:07.030> on<00:01:08.030> the<00:01:08.330> hybrid<00:01:09.320> on<00:01:09.560> twenty<00:01:09.860> fins

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.200 
ground on the hybrid on twenty fins
upper<00:01:12.440> is<00:01:12.530> actually<00:01:12.649> I'm<00:01:13.520> similar<00:01:13.940> to<00:01:14.119> the

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
upper is actually I'm similar to the

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.300 
upper is actually I'm similar to the
hyper<00:01:14.420> eyes<00:01:14.660> but<00:01:15.229> this<00:01:15.380> actually<00:01:15.619> offers<00:01:16.039> more

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
hyper eyes but this actually offers more

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.490 
hyper eyes but this actually offers more
lockdown<00:01:16.729> than<00:01:16.910> the<00:01:16.970> hyper<00:01:17.090> eyes<00:01:17.270> do<00:01:17.479> in<00:01:18.289> terms

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
lockdown than the hyper eyes do in terms

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.249 
lockdown than the hyper eyes do in terms

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.979 

just<00:04:02.440> like<00:04:02.560> the<00:04:02.680> Zuko<00:04:03.010> before<00:04:03.459> went<00:04:03.760> from

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
just like the Zuko before went from

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.479 
just like the Zuko before went from
lunar<00:04:04.989> foam<00:04:05.230> to<00:04:05.500> the<00:04:05.530> zoom<00:04:05.769> Kobe<00:04:06.010> 5<00:04:06.220> which<00:04:06.459> is

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
lunar foam to the zoom Kobe 5 which is

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:09.300 
lunar foam to the zoom Kobe 5 which is
zoom<00:04:06.730> air<00:04:06.940> the<00:04:07.660> same<00:04:07.900> thing<00:04:08.200> formula<00:04:08.920> for<00:04:09.220> the

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
zoom air the same thing formula for the

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.740 
zoom air the same thing formula for the
hyper<00:04:10.090> dunks<00:04:10.420> so<00:04:11.110> this<00:04:11.440> year<00:04:11.709> it<00:04:11.920> is<00:04:11.950> zoom<00:04:12.280> air

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
hyper dunks so this year it is zoom air

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.880 
hyper dunks so this year it is zoom air
