00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:08.550
 hello today we are going to learn how to make a 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:12.090
 semirecogido that as you see seems 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.740
 elaborated but it is very very simple 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.020
 we have some rites done that either 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.939
 we can make them with the iron or 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.100
 we have curly hair then with that 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:23.460
 ok let's distribute the hair in 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.470
 four is worth first of all let's 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:31.259
 leave a lock on each side 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.259
 more or less at the height of the ear 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.280
 another on the other side 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.710
 and what is left behind we are going to 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.710
 divide into 2 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.780
 one part higher and one part lower 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.440
 we will hold first the part of 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:15.080
 up a spike up in the part 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.080
 from below we will make a small pigtail 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:25.299
 and we will load a bit the top part 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.590
 at the height of the crown as always 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.799
 combing a little and throwing some 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.799
 lacquer 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:45.640
 once we have loaded the volume that 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:48.460
 we like we are going to twist it a little bit 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.120
 and put them on the other queue with 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.200
 a yoke from which you necesitÃ©is 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.530
 depending on the thickness of the hair 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:00.909
 you will need more or less to put them in 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:03.009
 below what we have rotated to 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.229
 then we will take another of the 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:07.800
 tufts on the side will take a little 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.800
 in the root 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:16.000
 and we will do the same , we will place it 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:19.420
 well and we'll turn 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.070
 and once we have rotated it we will place it 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.070
 also with hairpins 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.610
 always trying to make them look less 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.070
 possible 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.280
 and at the same time cover the rubber 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.959
 under 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.640
 we will do the same on the other side 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.640
 we will load the root a little 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.840
 we will place the hair is a semi 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:48.490
 disheveled with which you do not have to 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:52.290
 to be pulling in no time 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.290
 and we will spin again 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:58.840
 placing it again with a fork 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.840
 in the back 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.720
 Well this would be the final result if 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.310
 you want you can visit a little more 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.750
 of the hair with the iron depending 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.750
 of the curls that you want to get
