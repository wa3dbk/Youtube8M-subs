00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 one of the applications that most 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.350
 they would use youtube if we 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.929
 we have connected with the white cable what 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.929
 what we could do would be amplify 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:21.210
 that person 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.660
 how can we use 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.789
 our video screens to be able to 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.399
 watch the videos and use the radio with 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.570
 an amplifier then in this case what 

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:33.149
 we will do is we will 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.940
 connect the bluetooth or connect the 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:39.130
 devices via wind bluetooth no longer 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.670
 we need our white cable 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:44.250
 and we go to our radio link 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.970
 phone 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.970
 mode 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:52.840
 and I'm going to turn on here on my device 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.840
 the bluetooth 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.420
 and to link it 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.420
 what new device 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.500
 the link 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:08.210
 with the four zeros and automatically 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.340
 is with this connects 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:14.140
 that I can then see in this case already 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.140
 I already have access to my videos 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.619
 the entrance to the ipad videos 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.070
 I go to the initial screen and we see the 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.390
 Bluetooth bluetooth audio icon I'm going to 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.740
 leave it there 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.450
 and I can see 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.759
 the videos 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.610
 in this case the radio serves me with a 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:46.000
 sos amplifier 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:48.360
 I also have access to the menu for example 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.560
 of pause 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.560
 and overtake them 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.910
 and I have control from the screen 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:05.790
 and another and another part of video then 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:08.900
 let's go back to our youtube 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.900
 entered by safari 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.930
 and now only if we give click 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.239
 let's see this idea 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.260
 it can be an ipad screen of 10 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.510
 inches 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.950
 It can be located anywhere 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.299
 of the car and that in the back 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.680
 as activity screens 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:32.480
 headboard and I would not need any more 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.480
 had no wireless connection 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:40.390
 let's go now also then to 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.310
 other apps let's see a game 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.160
 for children are in the part of 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:48.250
 back and they want to play but they want 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.440
 listen for the speakers to run 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.090
 remember that we are connected via 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.650
 bluetooth 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.650
 and using our screens 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.720
 Well, it's a game 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.350
 we will return then to our 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.430
 application has a radius that is 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.430
 too good 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:27.849
 with gas 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:32.549
 and the most interesting thing is to use 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:32.549
 all video applications
