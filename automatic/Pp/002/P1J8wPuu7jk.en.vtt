00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.839
 from home nintendo 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.360

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.480
 So really color for the turn on 1 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.309
 Klatten I played is this 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.139
 game where you also from nintendo man the 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.240
 must make splashes of color on the floor 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.369
 also like one does not want to go that way 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.960
 that the yes that is not yet his 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.600
 teams and can hold you otherwise 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.150

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:48.809
 Okay now and then you can 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.430
 turn you into octopus and but 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.469
 The only special things you can do 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.270
 to have the tables on the color you have 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.649
 you can use the gun online 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.809
 example everything needs yours now 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.219
 seemed laura and then only on blue 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.410
 You are in syringe 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.809
 squid packaging which can 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.790
 beaches and jump and then have to 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.290
 the others must give you one 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.150
 color and you have to enter your area 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.950
 fairer and it gives us time 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.750
 has expired won the march 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.939
 colored by the area in its color 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.130
 has and that is cool that's right 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.140
 potential as well as sports moderately you 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.520
 can you if you do that fast 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.710
 then you can with the script you can 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.020
 So daddy jumping in the air 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.549

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.369
 and how could we do our first 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.380

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.759

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.210
 gamescom not yet to the files we 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.009

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.020
