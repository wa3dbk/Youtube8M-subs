00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.070
 the challenge 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.660
 my prize was to drive the new mclaren 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.920
 mp4 12c against one of the best 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:17.980
 nascar pilots 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.980
 Carl Edwards looks for more tires 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:27.250
 very good guys 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:29.940
 come on 3 2 1 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.940
 yes 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.830
 the start control of the mclaren left 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.720
 back out I was going forward but now 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:44.250
 I had to keep my position I will use my 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.250
 air brakes to distract him 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.860
 ah 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.490
 but that distracted me and prevented me 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.490
 see in the rearview mirror 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.470
 maybe maybe weight well but something that 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.400
 distinguishes carl edwards is that he never 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.400
 is left behind 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.170
 it's very fast on the straights 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:18.470
 I'm close to Mascardi is awesome 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.470
 God look at it 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.820
 It's not crazy 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.560
 God 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:35.340
 in theory this was just a test 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:38.700
 but two people being so energetic 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.030
 so competitive very soon they went head 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.030
 to head 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.480
 we go 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.390
 after five laps a pattern was noticed in 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.490
 the curves of the track the system 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.290
 mclaren braking and acceleration them 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.830
 they gave advantage 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.900
 like god this is fun but in the 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.020
 oval the power of the force was very 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.799
 big 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.799
 check it out 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:15.099
 very fast on the straights was head to 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.099
 head with carl edwards 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.709
 come on come on let's go I could not believe what 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.709
 I saw 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.879
 mclaren was struggling with a car 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.750
 career piloted by carl edwards in 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:30.750
 a nascar track 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:37.450
 the last moment showed me what was 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.450
 can do with 920 horsepower 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:45.060
 that speed must be crazy 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.060
 is incredible 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.920
 that was fantastic to drive next to 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:02.890
 Carl Edwards and Schumacher 99 has been a 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.400
 of the funniest things I've done 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.400
 in my life
