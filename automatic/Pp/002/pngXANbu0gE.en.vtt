and<00:02:17.260> this<00:02:17.379> is<00:02:17.439> the<00:02:17.650> bag<00:02:17.799> that<00:02:17.829> it<00:02:18.099> came<00:02:18.400> in<00:02:18.640> I

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
and this is the bag that it came in I

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.199 
and this is the bag that it came in I
did<00:02:19.780> open<00:02:20.110> it<00:02:20.230> up<00:02:20.379> earlier<00:02:20.829> but<00:02:21.189> put<00:02:21.970> it<00:02:22.030> back

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
did open it up earlier but put it back

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.179 
did open it up earlier but put it back
so<00:02:22.239> that<00:02:22.510> I<00:02:22.659> could<00:02:22.840> do<00:02:22.959> this<00:02:23.079> video<00:02:23.470> and<00:02:23.739> it

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:24.189 
so that I could do this video and it

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:25.920 
so that I could do this video and it
does<00:02:24.370> have<00:02:24.640> sort<00:02:25.060> of<00:02:25.150> like<00:02:25.360> that<00:02:25.599> vinyl

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
does have sort of like that vinyl

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.770 
does have sort of like that vinyl
plastic<00:02:26.920> smell<00:02:27.459> to<00:02:27.670> it<00:02:27.700> so<00:02:28.120> I<00:02:28.150> knew<00:02:28.450> right<00:02:28.480> away

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
plastic smell to it so I knew right away

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.030 
plastic smell to it so I knew right away
that<00:02:29.049> it<00:02:29.500> was<00:02:30.299> brand<00:02:31.299> new<00:02:31.859> from<00:02:32.859> the

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
that it was brand new from the

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.869 
that it was brand new from the
manufacturer<00:02:34.379> so<00:02:35.379> I'll<00:02:35.799> go<00:02:35.980> ahead<00:02:36.159> and<00:02:36.549> open

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:36.879 
manufacturer so I'll go ahead and open

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:39.479 
manufacturer so I'll go ahead and open
it<00:02:37.269> up<00:02:37.329> and<00:02:37.569> here's<00:02:38.140> what<00:02:38.349> it<00:02:38.409> looks<00:02:38.590> like<00:02:38.829> my

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
it up and here's what it looks like my

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.069 
it up and here's what it looks like my
first<00:02:39.730> impression<00:02:40.180> was<00:02:40.359> that<00:02:40.420> it<00:02:40.870> was<00:02:41.049> a

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:41.079 
first impression was that it was a

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:43.979 
first impression was that it was a
little<00:02:41.319> tiny<00:02:41.650> I<00:02:42.010> have<00:02:42.340> pretty<00:02:42.730> small<00:02:42.909> hands<00:02:43.659> my

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
little tiny I have pretty small hands my

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.039 
little tiny I have pretty small hands my
hands<00:02:44.170> are<00:02:44.319> pretty<00:02:44.439> petite<00:02:44.890> and<00:02:45.159> you<00:02:45.579> can<00:02:45.730> see

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
hands are pretty petite and you can see

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:50.520 
hands are pretty petite and you can see
this<00:02:47.049> is<00:02:47.379> pretty<00:02:47.680> small<00:02:48.010> it's<00:02:48.480> a<00:02:49.480> good<00:02:50.290> size

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
this is pretty small it's a good size

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.379 
this is pretty small it's a good size
for<00:02:50.920> putting<00:02:51.400> like<00:02:51.579> in<00:02:51.790> your<00:02:51.940> purse<00:02:52.150> but

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:54.389 
for putting like in your purse but

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:56.190 
for putting like in your purse but
actually<00:02:55.389> thought<00:02:55.599> it<00:02:55.659> was<00:02:55.810> going<00:02:56.019> to<00:02:56.079> be<00:02:56.170> a

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
actually thought it was going to be a

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.170 
actually thought it was going to be a
little<00:02:56.379> bit<00:02:56.530> bigger<00:02:56.739> from<00:02:57.310> the<00:02:57.489> picture<00:02:57.970> but

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
little bit bigger from the picture but

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.520 
little bit bigger from the picture but
either<00:02:58.989> way<00:02:59.230> here<00:02:59.590> it<00:02:59.680> is<00:02:59.799> and<00:03:01.019> just<00:03:02.019> open<00:03:02.439> it

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
either way here it is and just open it

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.460 
either way here it is and just open it
up<00:03:02.650> like<00:03:02.859> this<00:03:02.920> so<00:03:03.750> again<00:03:04.750> this<00:03:04.989> is<00:03:05.170> a<00:03:05.200> eight

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
up like this so again this is a eight

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.449 
up like this so again this is a eight
piece<00:03:05.709> in<00:03:06.010> the<00:03:06.609> picture<00:03:06.970> the<00:03:08.010> brush<00:03:09.010> handles

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
piece in the picture the brush handles

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.670 
piece in the picture the brush handles
look<00:03:09.700> white<00:03:10.150> but<00:03:10.420> they<00:03:10.569> are<00:03:10.659> actually<00:03:10.870> kind<00:03:11.560> of

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
look white but they are actually kind of

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.759 
look white but they are actually kind of
like<00:03:11.889> a<00:03:11.920> ivory<00:03:12.549> or<00:03:12.790> a<00:03:12.849> yellow<00:03:13.510> tint<00:03:13.810> to<00:03:14.590> them

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
like a ivory or a yellow tint to them

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:17.759 
like a ivory or a yellow tint to them
and<00:03:15.129> the<00:03:15.220> bristles<00:03:15.609> are<00:03:15.849> white<00:03:16.720> with<00:03:17.349> like

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
and the bristles are white with like

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:21.030 
and the bristles are white with like
pink<00:03:18.099> tips<00:03:18.639> I<00:03:19.599> really<00:03:20.019> like<00:03:20.199> that<00:03:20.410> because<00:03:20.650> if

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
pink tips I really like that because if

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.309 
pink tips I really like that because if
you<00:03:21.370> are<00:03:21.669> using<00:03:22.030> the<00:03:22.299> brushes<00:03:22.510> a<00:03:22.690> lot<00:03:22.959> and<00:03:23.169> you

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:23.319 
you are using the brushes a lot and you

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:25.170 
you are using the brushes a lot and you
clean<00:03:23.560> them<00:03:23.739> you<00:03:24.250> can<00:03:24.400> actually<00:03:24.549> tell<00:03:25.000> if

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
clean them you can actually tell if

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.140 
clean them you can actually tell if
they're<00:03:25.299> clean<00:03:25.569> or<00:03:25.720> not<00:03:25.870> by<00:03:26.609> making<00:03:27.609> sure<00:03:27.970> that

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
they're clean or not by making sure that

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.610 
they're clean or not by making sure that
they<00:03:28.329> actually<00:03:28.359> go<00:03:29.019> back<00:03:29.169> to<00:03:29.379> turning<00:03:29.739> white

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
they actually go back to turning white

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.189 
they actually go back to turning white
so<00:03:32.620> this<00:03:32.829> is<00:03:33.010> the<00:03:33.129> first<00:03:33.370> brush<00:03:34.090> you<00:03:34.870> can<00:03:35.169> see

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:35.199 
so this is the first brush you can see

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:39.360 
so this is the first brush you can see
some<00:03:35.769> of<00:03:35.919> the<00:03:36.150> bristles<00:03:37.470> are<00:03:38.470> kind<00:03:38.889> of<00:03:39.010> fraying

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
some of the bristles are kind of fraying

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.030 
some of the bristles are kind of fraying
but<00:03:40.090> if<00:03:40.239> you've<00:03:40.389> ever<00:03:40.599> bought<00:03:40.889> brushes<00:03:41.889> from

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
but if you've ever bought brushes from

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.250 
but if you've ever bought brushes from
forever21<00:03:42.699> I<00:03:43.209> would<00:03:43.359> say<00:03:43.540> this<00:03:43.810> is<00:03:44.019> probably

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
forever21 I would say this is probably

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.770 
forever21 I would say this is probably
about<00:03:44.620> the<00:03:44.769> same<00:03:45.040> quality<00:03:45.519> I<00:03:45.729> really<00:03:46.419> do<00:03:46.569> like

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
about the same quality I really do like

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.140 
about the same quality I really do like
these<00:03:46.989> brushes<00:03:47.530> because<00:03:47.970> they're<00:03:48.970> really

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
these brushes because they're really

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.059 
these brushes because they're really
easy<00:03:49.389> to<00:03:49.569> clean<00:03:49.690> and<00:03:50.049> like<00:03:50.500> I<00:03:50.620> said<00:03:50.680> you<00:03:50.919> can

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.069 
easy to clean and like I said you can

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:53.759 
easy to clean and like I said you can
tell<00:03:51.400> when<00:03:51.699> they're<00:03:51.849> clean<00:03:52.379> because<00:03:53.379> they<00:03:53.650> go

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
tell when they're clean because they go

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:57.089 
tell when they're clean because they go
back<00:03:53.979> to<00:03:54.250> being<00:03:54.489> the<00:03:54.760> same<00:03:55.120> color<00:03:55.799> this<00:03:56.799> one<00:03:57.069> is

00:03:57.089 --> 00:03:57.099 
back to being the same color this one is

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:01.469 
back to being the same color this one is
pretty<00:03:57.639> lightweight<00:03:58.060> I<00:03:58.690> would<00:03:59.169> say<00:03:59.669> but<00:04:00.669> for

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:01.479 
pretty lightweight I would say but for

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:03.240 
pretty lightweight I would say but for
the<00:04:01.569> price<00:04:01.750> that<00:04:01.810> I<00:04:02.049> paid<00:04:02.409> I<00:04:02.739> would<00:04:02.919> say<00:04:03.099> it<00:04:03.159> was

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
the price that I paid I would say it was

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.009 
the price that I paid I would say it was
really<00:04:03.370> good<00:04:03.669> because<00:04:03.909> I<00:04:03.940> do<00:04:04.060> have<00:04:04.180> a<00:04:04.389> set<00:04:04.810> of

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
really good because I do have a set of

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.640 
really good because I do have a set of
Mac<00:04:05.379> brushes<00:04:05.739> too<00:04:06.099> and<00:04:06.959> the<00:04:07.959> bristles<00:04:08.379> they

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
Mac brushes too and the bristles they

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.860 
Mac brushes too and the bristles they
fall<00:04:09.010> off<00:04:09.159> all<00:04:09.430> the<00:04:09.699> time<00:04:09.909> so<00:04:10.209> I<00:04:10.239> find<00:04:10.720> that

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
fall off all the time so I find that

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.199 
fall off all the time so I find that
these<00:04:11.139> are<00:04:11.379> actually<00:04:11.829> really<00:04:12.870> really<00:04:13.870> nice

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
these are actually really really nice

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.300 
these are actually really really nice
one<00:04:16.209> thing<00:04:16.479> that<00:04:16.750> I<00:04:16.780> didn't<00:04:17.260> like<00:04:17.409> about<00:04:17.769> this

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
one thing that I didn't like about this

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.550 
one thing that I didn't like about this
was<00:04:18.909> that<00:04:20.430> when<00:04:21.430> I<00:04:21.489> received<00:04:22.000> it<00:04:22.210> this<00:04:22.930> flap

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
was that when I received it this flap

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.649 
was that when I received it this flap
right<00:04:23.590> here<00:04:24.039> was<00:04:24.279> actually<00:04:24.460> folding<00:04:25.180> against

00:04:25.649 --> 00:04:25.659 
right here was actually folding against

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:26.850 
right here was actually folding against
the<00:04:25.900> brush

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
the brush

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.800 
the brush
so<00:04:26.979> the<00:04:27.189> brush<00:04:27.520> actually<00:04:28.210> had<00:04:28.479> like<00:04:28.659> an

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
so the brush actually had like an

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.260 
so the brush actually had like an
indentation<00:04:29.349> in<00:04:29.710> it<00:04:29.889> so<00:04:30.460> you<00:04:30.520> wish<00:04:30.879> that<00:04:30.909> the

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
indentation in it so you wish that the

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.110 
indentation in it so you wish that the
bag<00:04:31.449> was<00:04:31.720> a<00:04:31.870> little<00:04:32.169> bit<00:04:32.319> bigger<00:04:32.879> so<00:04:33.879> that<00:04:33.909> it

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
bag was a little bit bigger so that it

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.360 
bag was a little bit bigger so that it
didn't<00:04:34.569> happen<00:04:34.870> and<00:04:34.990> you<00:04:35.080> can<00:04:35.259> you<00:04:35.830> can<00:04:35.889> still

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
didn't happen and you can you can still

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.119 
didn't happen and you can you can still
sort<00:04:36.639> of<00:04:36.729> see<00:04:36.789> that<00:04:37.240> it's<00:04:37.479> kind<00:04:37.719> of<00:04:37.900> like<00:04:38.129> on

00:04:39.119 --> 00:04:39.129 
sort of see that it's kind of like on

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:41.490 
sort of see that it's kind of like on
the<00:04:39.610> flap<00:04:39.879> so<00:04:40.180> if<00:04:40.449> you're<00:04:40.599> not<00:04:40.750> careful<00:04:40.990> then

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
the flap so if you're not careful then

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.339
