00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
ball kind of create havoc and move their

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.630 
ball kind of create havoc and move their
figures<00:01:01.020> into<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.260> different<00:01:01.500> position<00:01:01.680> where

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
figures into a different position where

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.429 
figures into a different position where
they<00:01:02.730> can<00:01:02.850> hopefully<00:01:03.030> regain<00:01:03.359> possession<00:01:03.840> so

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
they can hopefully regain possession so

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.050 
they can hopefully regain possession so
as<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.680> defensive<00:01:05.100> flick<00:01:05.339> yeah<00:01:05.729> I'm<00:01:05.880> seeing

game if you were to miss the ball then

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.539 
game if you were to miss the ball then

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.310 
team if you were to flick and perhaps
need<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.520> figure<00:01:41.909> before<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.689> hit<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.930> ball<00:01:43.049> it

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
need a figure before you hit the ball it

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.230 
need a figure before you hit the ball it
would<00:01:43.500> change<00:01:43.710> possession<00:01:44.220> or<00:01:44.369> obviously

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
would change possession or obviously

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.700 
would change possession or obviously
just<00:01:45.420> like<00:01:45.570> in<00:01:45.689> soccer<00:01:45.899> if<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.350> were<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.530> kick

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
just like in soccer if you were to kick

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.020 
just like in soccer if you were to kick
the<00:01:46.860> ball<00:01:46.979> out<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.189> bounds<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.729> would<00:01:47.850> then

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
the ball out of bounds it would then

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.969 
the ball out of bounds it would then
revert<00:01:48.360> possession<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.110> other<00:01:49.290> player

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
revert possession to the other player

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.069 
revert possession to the other player
but<00:01:50.340> I<00:01:50.369> think<00:01:50.610> also<00:01:50.759> Zach<00:01:51.180> if<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.630> ball<00:01:51.810> would

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
but I think also Zach if the ball would

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.929 
but I think also Zach if the ball would
have<00:01:52.200> bounced<00:01:52.409> onto<00:01:52.770> another<00:01:52.950> figure<00:01:53.280> that

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
have bounced onto another figure that

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.340 
have bounced onto another figure that
would<00:01:54.060> be<00:01:54.270> always<00:01:54.659> like<00:01:54.840> an<00:01:54.990> interception

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
would be always like an interception

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.480 
would be always like an interception
that<00:01:55.470> would<00:01:55.649> also<00:01:55.799> be<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.070> change<00:01:56.369> of

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
that would also be a change of

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.999 
that would also be a change of
possession<00:01:56.790> correct<00:01:57.390> I<00:01:57.630> think<00:01:57.810> one<00:01:58.680> thing<00:01:58.890> is

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
possession correct I think one thing is

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.170 
possession correct I think one thing is
that<00:01:59.159> is<00:01:59.310> doing<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.549> great<00:01:59.670> job<00:01:59.790> they're

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
that is doing a great job they're

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.120 
that is doing a great job they're
explaining<00:02:00.600> that<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.290> just<00:02:01.469> interject<00:02:01.979> on

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
explaining that and just interject on

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.490 
explaining that and just interject on
one<00:02:02.369> thing<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:03.479> three<00:02:03.750> flakes<00:02:04.110> for<00:02:04.320> one

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
one thing the three flakes for one

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.590 
one thing the three flakes for one
figure<00:02:04.920> so<00:02:05.070> I<00:02:05.100> could<00:02:05.369> do<00:02:05.490> one<00:02:05.759> like<00:02:06.060> this<00:02:06.299> but

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
figure so I could do one like this but

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.719 
figure so I could do one like this but
if<00:02:06.689> I<00:02:06.780> use<00:02:06.810> another<00:02:07.350> figure<00:02:07.799> here<00:02:08.160> that<00:02:08.550> is

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
if I use another figure here that is

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.550 
if I use another figure here that is
reset<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.599> number<00:02:09.869> of<00:02:09.959> flakes<00:02:10.229> for<00:02:10.410> this

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
reset the number of flakes for this

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.650 
reset the number of flakes for this
figure<00:02:10.800> they<00:02:11.039> can<00:02:11.250> then<00:02:11.430> take<00:02:11.730> three<00:02:12.330> flakes

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
figure they can then take three flakes

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.580 
figure they can then take three flakes
etc<00:02:13.230> so<00:02:13.410> it's

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
etc so it's

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.500 
etc so it's
very<00:02:13.739> common<00:02:14.250> for<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.120> game<00:02:15.300> to<00:02:15.420> be<00:02:15.450> played

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
very common for the game to be played

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.290 
very common for the game to be played
where<00:02:16.110> maybe<00:02:16.379> a<00:02:16.800> ball<00:02:17.340> will<00:02:17.580> be<00:02:17.670> bounced<00:02:18.150> off

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
where maybe a ball will be bounced off

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.390 
where maybe a ball will be bounced off
another<00:02:18.840> figure<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:19.530> that<00:02:19.560> will<00:02:19.709> reset<00:02:19.950> the

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
another figure and that will reset the

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.979 
another figure and that will reset the
number<00:02:20.700> of<00:02:20.819> flakes<00:02:21.090> and<00:02:21.420> will<00:02:21.540> keep<00:02:21.780> your

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
number of flakes and will keep your

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.320 
number of flakes and will keep your
opportunity<00:02:22.709> of<00:02:22.920> maintaining<00:02:23.580> possession

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
opportunity of maintaining possession

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.680 
opportunity of maintaining possession
for<00:02:24.540> a<00:02:24.569> long<00:02:25.080> time<00:02:26.180> the<00:02:27.180> other<00:02:27.300> thing<00:02:27.510> that<00:02:27.540> I

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
for a long time the other thing that I

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.449 
for a long time the other thing that I
want<00:02:27.870> to<00:02:27.930> distress<00:02:28.230> does<00:02:28.530> that<00:02:28.769> mentioned<00:02:29.310> of

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
want to distress does that mentioned of

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.280 
want to distress does that mentioned of
course<00:02:29.670> playing<00:02:29.940> defense<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.660> defensive

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
course playing defense the defensive

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.140 
course playing defense the defensive
player<00:02:31.590> who<00:02:32.069> doesn't<00:02:32.340> have<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.549> ball<00:02:32.730> all<00:02:33.090> the

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
player who doesn't have the ball all the

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.380 
player who doesn't have the ball all the
time<00:02:33.360> is<00:02:33.870> going<00:02:34.049> to<00:02:34.200> be<00:02:34.319> making<00:02:35.150> blocking<00:02:36.150> or

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
time is going to be making blocking or

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.170 
time is going to be making blocking or
defensive<00:02:37.019> flakes<00:02:37.349> to<00:02:37.620> try<00:02:37.980> to<00:02:38.040> make<00:02:38.910> life

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
defensive flakes to try to make life

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.259 
defensive flakes to try to make life
difficult<00:02:39.569> for<00:02:39.989> their<00:02:40.260> opponent<00:02:40.980> however<00:02:41.640> one

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
difficult for their opponent however one

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:43.850 
difficult for their opponent however one
thing<00:02:42.480> I<00:02:42.569> like<00:02:42.780> to<00:02:42.959> stress<00:02:43.230> is<00:02:43.260> that<00:02:43.500> this

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
thing I like to stress is that this

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.680 
thing I like to stress is that this
isn't<00:02:44.099> a<00:02:44.280> game<00:02:44.489> here<00:02:44.819> you<00:02:44.849> see<00:02:45.150> Zach<00:02:45.420> and<00:02:45.630> I

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
isn't a game here you see Zach and I

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.900 
isn't a game here you see Zach and I
almost<00:02:45.900> taking<00:02:46.530> turns<00:02:46.799> where<00:02:47.310> it's<00:02:47.459> his<00:02:47.670> turn

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
almost taking turns where it's his turn

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.780 
almost taking turns where it's his turn
it's<00:02:48.239> my<00:02:48.299> turn<00:02:48.780> and<00:02:48.810> his<00:02:49.079> turn<00:02:49.319> my<00:02:49.620> turn

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
it's my turn and his turn my turn

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.330 
it's my turn and his turn my turn
if<00:02:51.030> Zach<00:02:51.599> plays<00:02:51.900> too<00:02:52.140> quickly<00:02:52.470> for<00:02:52.799> me<00:02:52.950> the

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
if Zach plays too quickly for me the

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.850 
if Zach plays too quickly for me the
rule<00:02:53.549> is<00:02:53.819> that<00:02:53.849> I<00:02:54.269> have<00:02:54.540> a<00:02:54.569> right<00:02:55.170> to<00:02:55.500> take<00:02:55.799> a

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
rule is that I have a right to take a

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.550 
rule is that I have a right to take a
defensive<00:02:56.130> flick<00:02:56.819> but<00:02:57.390> if<00:02:57.540> he's<00:02:57.780> just<00:02:58.170> too

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
defensive flick but if he's just too

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.800 
defensive flick but if he's just too
good<00:02:58.799> and<00:02:59.099> believe<00:02:59.310> me<00:02:59.459> he's<00:02:59.579> very<00:02:59.760> good<00:03:00.090> if<00:03:00.540> I

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
good and believe me he's very good if I

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.130 
good and believe me he's very good if I
can't<00:03:01.170> get<00:03:01.379> that<00:03:01.440> defensive<00:03:02.190> block<00:03:02.430> in<00:03:03.140> then

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
can't get that defensive block in then

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.949 
can't get that defensive block in then
he<00:03:04.590> gets<00:03:04.860> to<00:03:05.099> just<00:03:05.340> roll<00:03:05.579> on<00:03:05.849> now<00:03:06.209> when<00:03:06.870> you

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
he gets to just roll on now when you

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.539 
he gets to just roll on now when you
first<00:03:07.140> start<00:03:07.319> in<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:07.709> game<00:03:07.799> probably<00:03:08.370> don't

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
first start in the game probably don't

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.100 
first start in the game probably don't
want<00:03:08.670> to<00:03:08.730> play<00:03:08.849> too<00:03:08.910> quickly<00:03:09.599> you<00:03:09.750> want<00:03:09.840> to<00:03:09.989> get

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
want to play too quickly you want to get

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.539 
want to play too quickly you want to get
used<00:03:10.379> to<00:03:10.470> it<00:03:10.650> and<00:03:10.769> of<00:03:10.860> course<00:03:11.040> teaching<00:03:11.250> new

used to it and of course teaching new
players<00:03:11.849> taking<00:03:12.840> turns<00:03:13.110> is<00:03:13.410> a<00:03:13.440> good<00:03:13.680> way<00:03:13.860> to<00:03:13.920> go

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
players taking turns is a good way to go

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.339 
players taking turns is a good way to go
but<00:03:14.819> as<00:03:14.970> you<00:03:15.209> develop<00:03:15.629> your<00:03:15.780> skills<00:03:16.079> in<00:03:16.260> the
