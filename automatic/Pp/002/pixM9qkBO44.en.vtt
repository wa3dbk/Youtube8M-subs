00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.539
 for centuries man has persecuted 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.090
 the wolves attributing them the worst 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:20.730
 crimes most of them unfounded 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.880
 the case of the Mexican wolf is a 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.099
 sad story today there are only a few 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.460
 how many in some projects 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.460
 conservation 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:34.040
 still in the middle of the 20th century in the 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.920
 great solitudes of northern Mexico are 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.260
 they listened to the howls of the wolves 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.290
 wolves were a very successful kind of 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.930
 can not be broadly distributed throughout 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.870
 of Asia and North America propitiated that 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.780
 there were many subspecies or types of 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:54.110
 wolf the gray wolf mexican canis lupus 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.450
 baileyi was previously distributed by 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.540
 almost all of the north of our country and 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:02.060
 Southwest parts of the USA 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.250
 their elegant trot made them move 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:07.250
 thousands of kilometers far and wide 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.770
 of its gigantic territories in all 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.080
 the world the wolves have been persecuted 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.540
 by man but in mexico the 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.840
 extermination was brutal they were killed 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:20.420
 shots or poisoned in such a way that in 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.990
 free life practically remained extinct 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.840
 the Mexican wolves on the US side do not 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.780
 they ran better luck 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.719
 today only a few are left in some 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.569
 shelters in semi-captivity both in the USA 

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:37.240
 as in Mexico the distribution maps 

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:39.609
 of species where the territory in 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.789
 this case of the Mexican wolves is going 

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:45.060
 decreasing until almost disappear it 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:47.649
 Repeat with desperate frequency 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.869
 sadly many species have seen 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:52.709
 seriously reduce their areas of 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:55.569
 natural distribution many times 

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:57.729
 simply for the pleasure of killing the 

00:01:55.569 --> 00:02:00.909
 management unit for the conservation of 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:03.939
 wildlife called a buenavista 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:06.729
 of copper near cananea in sonora is 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:09.640
 a project that aims to save the wolf 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:12.280
 Mexican gray is the largest and with the 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.560
 best facilities in the country 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.260
 with 11 wolves and efforts are made by 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.720
 achieve its reproduction a serious problem 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.180
 for our Mexican wolves is that not 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.120
 there are many and it is difficult to avoid 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.640
 consanguinity which weakens the 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.340
 species and can be a factor of extinction 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.020
 to add efforts there is a commission 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.590
 binational for 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:37.000
 conservation of the Mexican gray wolf 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.130
 commitment among all projects 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.040
 Mexicans and those from southern states 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:45.010
 united to exchange copies for 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.400
 cross them and agree on other actions 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.870
 relevant to conserve the species 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.040
 we are simply in the unit of 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.410
 management for the conservation of life 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.820
 wild this is the project more 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.980
 important of the Mexico group for the 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.260
 conservation in this case the gray wolf 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.360
 Mexican that is an endangered species 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.970
 of extinction the project starts 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.950
 practically 10 years ago but one 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:09.070
 Mexican gray wolf family comes to 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.630
 Cananea year and a half ago from 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.930
 so 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:16.420
 we currently have 11 11 individuals 4 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.310
 males and 7 females and the goal of 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.160
 project is to reproduce it in captivity 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.620
 with the clear intention of returning the 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.210
 species the Mexican gray wolf to its 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.120
 natural habitat and with the firm hope 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:30.790
 that the wolf returns to howl in his 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.610
 natural habitat hopefully one day we 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:36.520
 let's hear howling and watch them jog 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.510
 again in nature but for that 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.239
 lack way to go 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.610
 many farmers and ranchers would not have 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:46.879
 objection to killing the newly wolves 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:49.610
 released maybe one day but I think 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:51.500
 which will be with other generations in 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.750
 goodview of copper are 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.629
 excellent facilities for management 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:59.239
 and an intensive reproduction but the most 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:02.360
 interesting is being able to see the wolves in 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:04.609
 its semi-captive enclosures is what 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.670
 closer than we can be to what 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:09.740
 it was a fantastic smart species and 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.200
 little understood 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:14.030
 during the 20th century they were made 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.150
 efforts to exterminate the wolf 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.500
 Mexican today thanks to projects like the 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.239
 of buenavista del cobre 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:24.430
 the wolves again have a 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.430
 opportunity there I leave you homework
