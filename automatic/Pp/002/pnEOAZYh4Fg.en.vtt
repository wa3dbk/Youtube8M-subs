scratching<00:00:20.640> under<00:00:20.910> a<00:00:20.939> piece<00:00:21.150> of<00:00:21.180> Mopani<00:00:21.900> wood

I<00:00:25.160> believe<00:00:26.160> there's<00:00:26.430> probably<00:00:26.699> some<00:00:26.939> itching

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
I believe there's probably some itching

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.390 
I believe there's probably some itching
as<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.660> shell<00:00:27.900> grows<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.590> scutes<00:00:28.890> loosen

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
as the shell grows and the scutes loosen

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.669 
as the shell grows and the scutes loosen
and<00:00:29.640> they'll<00:00:30.359> probably<00:00:30.539> scratch<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.500> help

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
and they'll probably scratch to help

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.280 
and they'll probably scratch to help
loosen<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.160> scoots<00:00:32.460> she<00:00:33.390> stopped<00:00:33.809> when<00:00:34.050> she
