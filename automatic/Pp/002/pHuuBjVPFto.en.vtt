if<00:00:22.080> you<00:00:22.260> just<00:00:22.529> nudge<00:00:22.740> him<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:22.949> little<00:00:23.189> bit

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
if you just nudge him a little bit

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.800 
if you just nudge him a little bit

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
rocks around quite a bit he's got a

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.130 
rocks around quite a bit he's got a
little<00:00:26.699> plastic<00:00:26.910> but<00:00:27.330> that<00:00:27.510> slides<00:00:27.840> a<00:00:28.019> little

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
little plastic but that slides a little

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.040 
little plastic but that slides a little
bit<00:00:28.349> on<00:00:28.500> on<00:00:28.740> surfaces<00:00:29.400> so<00:00:29.640> I<00:00:29.900> wouldn't<00:00:30.900> be

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
bit on on surfaces so I wouldn't be

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.049 
bit on on surfaces so I wouldn't be
surprised<00:00:31.470> if<00:00:31.679> he<00:00:31.830> could<00:00:32.040> slide<00:00:32.489> his<00:00:32.669> way<00:00:32.850> off

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
surprised if he could slide his way off

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.970 
surprised if he could slide his way off
a<00:00:33.090> counter<00:00:33.600> or<00:00:33.750> some<00:00:33.930> other<00:00:34.050> kind<00:00:34.320> of<00:00:34.440> high<00:00:34.950> up

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
a counter or some other kind of high up

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.530 
a counter or some other kind of high up
surface<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.760> he's<00:00:35.850> you<00:00:36.090> know<00:00:36.149> he's<00:00:36.300> pretty

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
surface and he's you know he's pretty

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.150 
surface and he's you know he's pretty
heavy<00:00:36.840> so<00:00:37.110> I<00:00:37.140> think<00:00:37.260> this<00:00:37.530> could<00:00:37.649> hurt<00:00:37.950> if<00:00:38.070> it

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
heavy so I think this could hurt if it

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.889 
heavy so I think this could hurt if it
lands<00:00:38.309> on<00:00:38.430> my<00:00:38.550> kid's<00:00:38.760> foot<00:00:39.030> or<00:00:39.180> something<00:00:39.510> so<00:00:39.690> I

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
lands on my kid's foot or something so I

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.090 
lands on my kid's foot or something so I
would<00:00:40.230> probably<00:00:40.410> just<00:00:40.710> keep<00:00:40.860> him<00:00:40.980> on<00:00:41.040> the

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
would probably just keep him on the

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.010 
would probably just keep him on the
floor<00:00:41.460> on<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.000> carpet<00:00:42.510> or<00:00:42.600> something<00:00:42.899> where

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
floor on the carpet or something where

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.709 
floor on the carpet or something where
he<00:00:43.140> won't<00:00:43.320> fall<00:00:43.530> off<00:00:43.559> of<00:00:43.890> something<00:00:44.309> so<00:00:44.719> he

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
he won't fall off of something so he

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.090 
he won't fall off of something so he
does<00:00:45.870> make<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.079> lot<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.289> noise<00:00:46.500> when<00:00:46.530> your<00:00:46.890> child

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
does make a lot of noise when your child

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.100 
does make a lot of noise when your child
lose<00:00:47.340> him<00:00:47.489> around<00:00:47.700> so<00:00:48.059> I<00:00:48.270> just<00:00:48.690> bear<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:48.930> in

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
lose him around so I just bear that in

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.569 
lose him around so I just bear that in
mind<00:00:49.410> so<00:00:49.530> he<00:00:49.620> does<00:00:49.800> kind<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.100> these<00:00:50.250> little

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
mind so he does kind of these little

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.400 
mind so he does kind of these little
random<00:00:50.910> things<00:00:51.120> when<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:51.449> knock<00:00:51.960> him<00:00:52.199> but<00:00:52.350> he

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.149 
minute here yeah the music isn't too
annoying<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.439> I<00:01:46.500> think<00:01:46.680> these<00:01:46.770> toys<00:01:47.009> have

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
annoying and I think these toys have

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.499 
annoying and I think these toys have
gotten<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.430> lot<00:01:47.520> better<00:01:47.759> at<00:01:48.030> being<00:01:48.240> able<00:01:48.360> to

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
gotten a lot better at being able to

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.539 
gotten a lot better at being able to
work<00:01:49.229> with<00:01:49.409> some<00:01:49.560> digitized<00:01:49.979> music<00:01:50.399> so<00:01:50.490> you

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
work with some digitized music so you

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.429 
work with some digitized music so you
don't<00:01:50.729> get<00:01:50.820> some<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.119> those<00:01:51.210> annoying<00:01:51.479> bells

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
don't get some of those annoying bells

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.810 
don't get some of those annoying bells
and<00:01:52.649> whistles<00:01:52.979> that<00:01:53.159> you<00:01:53.189> used<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.520> get<00:01:53.700> with

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
and whistles that you used to get with

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.060 
and whistles that you used to get with
the<00:01:53.909> toys<00:01:54.090> when<00:01:54.299> I<00:01:54.360> was<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:54.540> kid<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:54.950> yeah<00:01:55.950> it

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
the toys when I was a kid so yeah it

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.230 
the toys when I was a kid so yeah it
kind<00:01:56.219> of<00:01:56.250> reminds<00:01:56.490> me<00:01:56.579> a<00:01:56.670> little<00:01:56.790> bit<00:01:56.909> of<00:01:57.060> Teddy

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
kind of reminds me a little bit of Teddy

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.969 
kind of reminds me a little bit of Teddy
Ruxpin<00:01:57.750> which<00:01:57.930> was<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.439> thing<00:01:58.619> you<00:01:58.710> said<00:01:58.890> that

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
Ruxpin which was the thing you said that

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.770 
Ruxpin which was the thing you said that
put<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.159> tape<00:01:59.430> recorder<00:01:59.880> in<00:01:59.909> back<00:02:00.270> in<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.450> 80s

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
put a tape recorder in back in the 80s

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.330 
put a tape recorder in back in the 80s
but<00:02:00.930> overall<00:02:01.710> it's<00:02:01.829> pretty<00:02:01.979> good<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.159> mean<00:02:02.219> they

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
but overall it's pretty good I mean they

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.160 
but overall it's pretty good I mean they
really<00:02:02.640> over<00:02:02.969> Bill<00:02:03.180> it<00:02:03.329> as<00:02:03.420> an<00:02:03.540> educational

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
really over Bill it as an educational

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.780 
really over Bill it as an educational
tool<00:02:04.320> I<00:02:04.380> mean<00:02:04.590> it<00:02:04.680> does<00:02:04.829> do<00:02:05.009> some<00:02:05.189> prompting<00:02:05.610> to

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
tool I mean it does do some prompting to

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.340 
tool I mean it does do some prompting to
ask<00:02:05.939> your<00:02:06.180> child<00:02:06.420> you<00:02:06.659> know<00:02:06.719> in<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:06.960> case<00:02:07.079> of

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
ask your child you know in the case of

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.260 
ask your child you know in the case of
colors<00:02:08.009> what<00:02:08.250> colors<00:02:08.520> they<00:02:08.729> see<00:02:08.789> around<00:02:09.000> the

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
colors what colors they see around the

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.369 
colors what colors they see around the
house<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:09.690> that<00:02:09.750> kind<00:02:09.959> of<00:02:09.989> thing<00:02:10.200> which<00:02:10.349> is

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
house and that kind of thing which is

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.900 
house and that kind of thing which is
which<00:02:10.890> is<00:02:11.009> good<00:02:11.220> but<00:02:11.400> I<00:02:11.459> think<00:02:11.670> you<00:02:11.819> know

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
which is good but I think you know

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.940 
which is good but I think you know
there's<00:02:12.090> there's<00:02:12.390> to<00:02:13.110> be<00:02:13.140> more<00:02:13.379> educational

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
there's there's to be more educational

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:14.150 
there's there's to be more educational
through

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
through

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.070 
through
more<00:02:14.370> parent<00:02:14.790> involvement<00:02:15.180> and<00:02:15.480> some<00:02:15.900> of<00:02:15.990> the

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
more parent involvement and some of the

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.570 
more parent involvement and some of the
activity<00:02:16.500> I<00:02:16.530> mean<00:02:16.710> clearly<00:02:16.950> you<00:02:17.040> can<00:02:17.310> sit<00:02:17.490> with

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
activity I mean clearly you can sit with

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.430 
activity I mean clearly you can sit with
a<00:02:17.640> child<00:02:17.910> and<00:02:18.150> kind<00:02:18.630> of<00:02:18.660> review<00:02:18.930> those<00:02:19.140> things

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
a child and kind of review those things

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.510 
a child and kind of review those things
but<00:02:19.620> it<00:02:19.710> might<00:02:19.830> be<00:02:19.950> a<00:02:20.130> little<00:02:20.250> bit<00:02:20.430> more

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
but it might be a little bit more

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.970 
but it might be a little bit more
valuable<00:02:20.910> educationally<00:02:21.780> to<00:02:22.020> ask<00:02:22.650> those

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
valuable educationally to ask those

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.710 
valuable educationally to ask those
things<00:02:23.310> of<00:02:23.490> the<00:02:23.580> child<00:02:23.820> without<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.180> toy

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
things of the child without the toy

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.660 
things of the child without the toy
involved<00:02:25.170> with<00:02:25.260> it<00:02:25.410> but<00:02:25.620> overall<00:02:26.340> it's<00:02:26.550> pretty

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
involved with it but overall it's pretty

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.040 
involved with it but overall it's pretty
fun<00:02:26.910> my<00:02:27.060> six-month-old<00:02:27.570> daughter<00:02:27.600> has<00:02:27.930> been

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
playing with it it hasn't freaked her

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.440 
playing with it it hasn't freaked her
out<00:02:29.220> too<00:02:29.460> much<00:02:29.610> I<00:02:29.760> mean<00:02:29.850> this<00:02:30.000> thing's<00:02:30.180> as<00:02:30.300> big

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
out too much I mean this thing's as big

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.760 
out too much I mean this thing's as big
as<00:02:30.570> she<00:02:30.600> is<00:02:30.750> her<00:02:30.960> and<00:02:31.050> it's<00:02:31.170> sitting<00:02:31.320> up<00:02:31.560> and
