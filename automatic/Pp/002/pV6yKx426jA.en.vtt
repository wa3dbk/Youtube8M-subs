00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
skin so it's very highlighted but I

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.810

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
of pink on the cheeks but I think it's

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.049

very just I don't want to say natural
but<00:00:33.450> I<00:00:33.480> think<00:00:33.780> it's<00:00:33.930> just<00:00:34.140> like<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.649> gorgeous

first<00:00:48.329> thing<00:00:48.450> I'm<00:00:48.570> using<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.230> it

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
first thing I'm using is the it

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.729 
first thing I'm using is the it
cosmetics<00:00:50.340> CC<00:00:50.520> cream<00:00:50.969> with<00:00:51.210> my<00:00:51.420> Sigma<00:00:51.960> f80<00:00:52.530> 8

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
cosmetics CC cream with my Sigma f80 8

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.459 
cosmetics CC cream with my Sigma f80 8
brush<00:00:53.039> so<00:00:54.030> for<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.300> CC<00:00:54.629> cream<00:00:54.660> it's<00:00:55.110> really

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
brush so for the CC cream it's really

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.709 
brush so for the CC cream it's really
good<00:00:55.649> I<00:00:55.680> really<00:00:55.770> like<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.460> um<00:00:56.640> it's<00:00:57.030> very<00:00:57.149> light

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
good I really like it um it's very light

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.779 
good I really like it um it's very light
so<00:00:57.930> it's<00:00:58.050> it's<00:00:58.170> not<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.379> foundation<00:00:58.739> but<00:00:59.609> it

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
so it's it's not a foundation but it

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.700 
so it's it's not a foundation but it
does<00:01:00.030> provides<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.629> lot<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:00.840> coverage<00:01:01.260> so<00:01:01.530> if

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
does provides a lot of coverage so if

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.850 
does provides a lot of coverage so if
you're<00:01:01.859> looking<00:01:02.070> for<00:01:02.579> something<00:01:02.910> very<00:01:02.940> light

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
you're looking for something very light

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.560 
you're looking for something very light
for<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.949> summer<00:01:05.189> but<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:05.909> still<00:01:06.299> want<00:01:06.510> the

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
for the summer but you still want the

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.810 
for the summer but you still want the
coverage<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:07.080> think<00:01:07.110> this<00:01:07.740> is<00:01:08.070> something<00:01:08.520> great

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
coverage I think this is something great

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.719 
coverage I think this is something great
to<00:01:09.060> have<00:01:09.240> because<00:01:09.750> it<00:01:10.320> covers<00:01:10.860> up<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.130> lot<00:01:11.340> but

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
to have because it covers up a lot but

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.580 
to have because it covers up a lot but
it<00:01:11.850> doesn't<00:01:11.880> feel<00:01:12.450> too<00:01:12.810> heavy<00:01:12.990> on<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.320> skin

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
it doesn't feel too heavy on the skin

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.859 
it doesn't feel too heavy on the skin
and<00:01:13.770> also<00:01:14.280> it's<00:01:14.820> really<00:01:15.299> great<00:01:15.509> because<00:01:15.720> I

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
and also it's really great because I

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.429 
and also it's really great because I
have<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.200> SPF<00:01:16.680> of<00:01:16.799> 50<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.869> yeah<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.110> finish

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
have the SPF of 50 and yeah the finish

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.800 
have the SPF of 50 and yeah the finish
is<00:01:19.650> not<00:01:19.799> matte<00:01:20.189> but<00:01:20.460> not<00:01:20.520> dewy<00:01:21.000> it's<00:01:21.360> in<00:01:21.659> the

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
is not matte but not dewy it's in the

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.270 
is not matte but not dewy it's in the
middle<00:01:22.080> I<00:01:22.200> would<00:01:22.350> say<00:01:22.560> it's<00:01:22.710> just<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:23.040> very

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
middle I would say it's just a very

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.940 
middle I would say it's just a very
natural<00:01:23.820> finish<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.390> still<00:01:25.020> has<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.320> little<00:01:25.680> bit

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
natural finish it still has a little bit

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.429 
natural finish it still has a little bit
of<00:01:26.009> glow<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:26.909> it<00:01:27.090> so<00:01:27.240> it's<00:01:27.360> not<00:01:27.479> mad<00:01:27.810> I'm<00:01:27.990> just

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860

highlighting so I'm using this cream
highlighter<00:02:05.310> from<00:02:05.549> Illamasqua<00:02:05.820> I<00:02:06.360> really

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
highlighter from Illamasqua I really

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.779 
highlighter from Illamasqua I really
like<00:02:07.170> it<00:02:07.350> because<00:02:07.679> since<00:02:07.950> it's<00:02:08.160> a<00:02:08.250> cream<00:02:08.550> it

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
like it because since it's a cream it

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.850 
like it because since it's a cream it
gives<00:02:09.030> a<00:02:09.209> very<00:02:09.420> dewy<00:02:09.810> look<00:02:09.959> to<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.440> skin<00:02:10.679> and

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
gives a very dewy look to the skin and

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.710 
gives a very dewy look to the skin and
this<00:02:11.310> is<00:02:11.370> what<00:02:11.640> I<00:02:11.670> was<00:02:11.849> going<00:02:12.150> for<00:02:12.180> for<00:02:12.599> this

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
this is what I was going for for this

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.839 
this is what I was going for for this
look<00:02:12.900> so<00:02:12.959> I<00:02:13.500> used<00:02:13.860> a<00:02:14.010> lot<00:02:14.160> of<00:02:14.310> it<00:02:14.430> because<00:02:14.610> I

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
look so I used a lot of it because I

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:17.030 
look so I used a lot of it because I
wanted<00:02:15.269> a<00:02:15.450> more<00:02:15.630> intense<00:02:16.019> highlight<00:02:16.440> since

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
wanted a more intense highlight since

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.440 
wanted a more intense highlight since
the<00:02:17.220> Victoria's<00:02:17.610> Secret<00:02:17.640> models<00:02:18.209> usually

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
the Victoria's Secret models usually

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.330 
the Victoria's Secret models usually
have<00:02:18.840> a<00:02:18.870> lot<00:02:19.170> of<00:02:19.200> highlight<00:02:19.620> on<00:02:19.769> during<00:02:20.220> the

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
have a lot of highlight on during the

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:34.820 
have a lot of highlight on during the
runways<00:02:32.390> so<00:02:33.390> I'm<00:02:33.450> also<00:02:33.660> using<00:02:34.080> a<00:02:34.380> brush<00:02:34.590> to

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
runways so I'm also using a brush to

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.650 
runways so I'm also using a brush to
blend<00:02:35.010> everything<00:02:35.250> out<00:02:35.670> and<00:02:35.880> then<00:02:36.090> I'm<00:02:36.239> even

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
blend everything out and then I'm even

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.500 
blend everything out and then I'm even
gonna<00:02:36.810> add<00:02:37.049> some<00:02:37.319> more<00:02:37.530> with<00:02:37.799> the<00:02:37.950> brush<00:02:38.360> so<00:02:39.360> it

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
gonna add some more with the brush so it

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.120 
gonna add some more with the brush so it
gives<00:02:39.720> a<00:02:39.810> more<00:02:39.989> intense<00:02:40.319> highlight<00:02:40.680> even<00:02:40.950> more

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
gives a more intense highlight even more

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.490 
gives a more intense highlight even more
so<00:02:41.430> in<00:02:42.120> a<00:02:42.209> few<00:02:42.360> seconds<00:02:42.720> you<00:02:42.870> will<00:02:43.019> see<00:02:43.049> the

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
so in a few seconds you will see the

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.110 
so in a few seconds you will see the
whole<00:02:43.680> setup<00:02:44.040> will<00:02:44.310> change<00:02:44.549> it's<00:02:44.790> because<00:02:45.090> I

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
whole setup will change it's because I

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.780 
whole setup will change it's because I
had<00:02:45.329> to<00:02:45.599> film<00:02:46.319> this<00:02:46.470> video<00:02:46.590> in<00:02:46.890> two<00:02:47.160> different

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
had to film this video in two different

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.490 
had to film this video in two different
days<00:02:48.150> because<00:02:48.569> I<00:02:48.599> lost<00:02:48.900> some<00:02:49.079> of<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.319> footage

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
days because I lost some of the footage

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.940 
days because I lost some of the footage
so<00:02:49.860> now<00:02:50.040> we<00:02:50.430> will<00:02:50.579> have<00:02:50.730> very<00:02:51.120> good<00:02:51.299> lighting

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
so now we will have very good lighting

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.890 
so now we will have very good lighting
so<00:02:52.950> as<00:02:53.040> you<00:02:53.160> can<00:02:53.280> tell<00:02:53.459> it's<00:02:53.670> very<00:02:54.090> glowy<00:02:54.450> and<00:02:54.599> I

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.880 
powder because I don't want the cream to
move<00:03:02.400> and<00:03:02.700> to<00:03:02.819> crease<00:03:03.350> then<00:03:04.350> I'm<00:03:04.500> using<00:03:04.620> the
