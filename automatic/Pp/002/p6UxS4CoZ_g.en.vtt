00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
to the iPhone 4s the iPhone 4 but I have

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.220 
to the iPhone 4s the iPhone 4 but I have
to<00:00:12.120> say<00:00:12.240> when<00:00:12.389> you<00:00:12.480> pick<00:00:12.599> it<00:00:12.630> up<00:00:12.780> in<00:00:12.900> your<00:00:13.019> hands

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
to say when you pick it up in your hands

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.839 
to say when you pick it up in your hands
there<00:00:13.469> is<00:00:13.559> an<00:00:13.679> immediate<00:00:13.920> noticeable

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
there is an immediate noticeable

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.250 
there is an immediate noticeable
difference<00:00:15.299> it's<00:00:15.839> thinner<00:00:16.500> it's<00:00:16.910> lighter<00:00:18.260> it

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
difference it's thinner it's lighter it

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.800 
difference it's thinner it's lighter it
feels<00:00:20.090> incredibly<00:00:21.090> light<00:00:21.300> actually<00:00:21.689> it's

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
feels incredibly light actually it's

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.390 
feels incredibly light actually it's
almost<00:00:21.960> bizarrely<00:00:22.560> light<00:00:22.890> when<00:00:23.039> I<00:00:23.100> picked<00:00:23.310> it

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
almost bizarrely light when I picked it

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.500 
almost bizarrely light when I picked it
up<00:00:23.460> I<00:00:23.609> almost<00:00:23.730> dropped<00:00:24.000> it<00:00:24.210> because<00:00:24.449> I

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
up I almost dropped it because I

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.060 
up I almost dropped it because I
expected<00:00:24.990> more<00:00:25.199> weight<00:00:25.410> than<00:00:25.529> is<00:00:25.680> actually

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
expected more weight than is actually

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.580 
expected more weight than is actually
here<00:00:26.340> but<00:00:26.970> that<00:00:27.750> doesn't<00:00:27.990> mean<00:00:28.080> that<00:00:28.109> it's<00:00:28.320> you

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
here but that doesn't mean that it's you

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.050 
here but that doesn't mean that it's you
know<00:00:28.619> cheaply<00:00:28.980> constructed<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.640> back<00:00:29.820> is<00:00:30.029> a

but you know the big story today is not
the<00:01:31.259> operating<00:01:31.740> system<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.159> big<00:01:32.280> story<00:01:32.490> today

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
the operating system the big story today

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.880 
the operating system the big story today
is<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.119> hardware<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.930> I<00:01:33.960> have<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.409> say<00:01:34.590> it's

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
is the hardware and I have to say it's

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.670 
is the hardware and I have to say it's
definitely<00:01:35.659> it<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:36.720> an<00:01:36.960> evolution<00:01:37.229> in<00:01:37.590> terms

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
definitely it is an evolution in terms

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.289 
definitely it is an evolution in terms
of<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.920> design<00:01:38.189> language<00:01:38.700> but<00:01:38.909> I<00:01:38.939> spoke<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.270> a

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
of the design language but I spoke to a

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.109 
of the design language but I spoke to a
Phil<00:01:39.540> Schiller<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:40.439> he<00:01:40.860> said<00:01:41.100> that<00:01:41.790> this<00:01:42.060> was

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
Phil Schiller and he said that this was

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.560 
Phil Schiller and he said that this was
a<00:01:42.270> complete<00:01:43.140> ground-up<00:01:43.860> new<00:01:44.610> project<00:01:45.420> for

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
a complete ground-up new project for

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.789 
a complete ground-up new project for
them<00:01:45.689> they<00:01:45.869> looked<00:01:46.110> at<00:01:46.200> this<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.500> they<00:01:46.560> said

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
them they looked at this and they said

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.590 
them they looked at this and they said
let's<00:01:47.310> just<00:01:47.460> kind<00:01:47.610> of<00:01:47.670> blow<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:48.299> know<00:01:48.420> blow

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
let's just kind of blow you know blow

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.910 
let's just kind of blow you know blow
part<00:01:48.869> what<00:01:48.990> we've<00:01:49.110> already<00:01:49.290> done<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.770> build

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
part what we've already done and build

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.590 
part what we've already done and build
something<00:01:50.100> new<00:01:50.310> from<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.549> ground<00:01:50.850> up<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.479> you

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
something new from the ground up and you

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.999 
something new from the ground up and you
do<00:01:51.720> see<00:01:51.869> little<00:01:52.110> differences<00:01:52.530> that<00:01:52.770> that

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
do see little differences that that

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.230 
do see little differences that that
indicate<00:01:53.520> that<00:01:53.700> that's<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.060> case

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
indicate that that's the case

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.670 
indicate that that's the case
particularly<00:01:54.899> one<00:01:55.140> of<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.290> things<00:01:55.500> that<00:01:55.619> I

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
particularly one of the things that I

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.200 
particularly one of the things that I
noticed<00:01:56.040> is<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.280> detail<00:01:56.700> on<00:01:56.729> this<00:01:57.000> the

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
noticed is the detail on this the

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.030 
noticed is the detail on this the
machined<00:01:57.600> edges<00:01:57.960> of<00:01:58.079> this<00:01:58.229> I<00:01:58.469> heard<00:01:58.829> somebody

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
machined edges of this I heard somebody

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.200 
machined edges of this I heard somebody
here<00:01:59.280> say<00:01:59.460> it<00:01:59.520> looked<00:01:59.700> a<00:01:59.759> little<00:01:59.850> bit<00:02:00.030> like

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
here say it looked a little bit like

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.730 
here say it looked a little bit like
jewelry<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:00.869> have<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:01.140> agree<00:02:01.439> that<00:02:01.469> there

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
jewelry and I have to agree that there

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.100 
jewelry and I have to agree that there
is<00:02:01.829> kind<00:02:02.009> of<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.490> jewelry<00:02:03.270> feel<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:03.990> way

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
is kind of a jewelry feel to the way

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.280 
is kind of a jewelry feel to the way
these<00:02:04.290> edges<00:02:04.680> are<00:02:04.770> machined<00:02:05.329> and<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:07.020> as

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
these edges are machined and and as

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.139 
these edges are machined and and as
clean<00:02:07.710> as<00:02:07.890> they<00:02:08.039> are<00:02:08.190> one<00:02:08.729> other<00:02:08.879> thing<00:02:09.030> to

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
clean as they are one other thing to

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.820 
clean as they are one other thing to
note<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.810> headphone<00:02:10.140> jack<00:02:10.170> has<00:02:10.530> moved<00:02:10.739> down

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
note the headphone jack has moved down

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.199 
note the headphone jack has moved down
to<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.160> bottom

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
to the bottom

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.259 
to the bottom
and<00:02:12.750> it<00:02:13.110> now<00:02:13.260> has<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:14.220> new<00:02:14.400> lightning<00:02:14.790> dock

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
and it now has the new lightning dock

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:19.030 
and it now has the new lightning dock
port<00:02:15.650> which<00:02:16.650> is<00:02:16.680> much<00:02:17.129> smaller<00:02:17.540> obviously<00:02:18.540> and

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
port which is much smaller obviously and

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.500 
port which is much smaller obviously and
faster<00:02:20.040> as<00:02:20.280> Apple<00:02:20.909> claims<00:02:21.120> and<00:02:21.239> has<00:02:21.330> a<00:02:21.360> bunch

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
faster as Apple claims and has a bunch

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.420 
faster as Apple claims and has a bunch
of<00:02:21.599> other<00:02:21.780> features<00:02:21.989> that<00:02:22.230> are<00:02:22.470> helpful<00:02:23.250> of
