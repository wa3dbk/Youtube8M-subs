00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.230
 Welcome my dear viewers to another part of ours 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.090
 today's industry interviews here 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.950
 the Vienna Network companies from their region 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.160
 imagine 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.460
 are still guests 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.890
 here in the center for Alexander Technique in Berlin 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.000
 Middle and I may also again 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.650
 Welcome she founded this center Mrs. Barbara Blickensdorf nice day 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.520
 more often than if my dear viewers are our problems too 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.450
 Example in the back 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.780
 or in the joints, the consequences of dealing with ourselves as exactly as possible 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.630
 halves Alexander Technik to that we have already in the previous interview 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.270
 experienced by Magnus Soft as well we have learned that we 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.630
 the Alexander Technique 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.290
 in individual or group lessons can learn and in this case goes 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.390
 It's about a very special course they offer here it can already 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.940
 a bit more often guess it's about Alexander Fehling especially pioneer what 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.280
 is the special thing about it 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.869
 we fall work 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:37.410
 because of the head joint 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.870
 so he took it that maybe you can see the head-joint 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.930
 is here at the point where the spine starts 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.910
 first and second as would 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.910
 are the head cinema together 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.500
 in the little hacker here the bottom of the skull 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.970
 if you let go in this area and head out while massaging 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.830
 can let then it affects the whole on nas systems positive 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.530
 the central and control or with the technical term of Alexander spoke 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.819
 Numbers like account 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.619
 and that 's what we're working on here on the horse the student had himself on the horse 

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:19.739
 this is what Werther calls it, and then around the work, the head joint 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:20.879
 to back up 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:22.559
 that the head is up 

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:26.719
 Percent upward orientation can connect with the space 

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:27.899
 over the head 

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:31.569
 that the back distracts and directs this task make the contact 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:33.569
 record additional 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.589
 just for friday the seats are more important for 

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:40.719
 Understanding to instrument with the horse over this bone one goes the 

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:44.079
 so-called aids for that clarifies 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:47.519
 the better the rider is in the balance we are sure 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.439
 undisturbed one can give these helps the stove drives as well 

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:55.450
 provide the information he wants and not 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.400
 involuntarily other information 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.520
 because he brings himself out of balance 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.580
 for example by wearing his head or moving his arms 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.759
 then viewers were allowed to do research 

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:09.409
 at her Alexander hour 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:12.760
 Among other things, they also demand something like this on the field 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.219
 dispense comes 

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:18.549
 The highlight is "I had not been so long ago and during the year 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:19.650
 trained here 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.950
 with baroque Christopher civilians but also when we did and we did 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.389
 then have it in parallel 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:27.389
 trained on the horse and it is natural 

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:29.729
 Loyalty Weinmann 

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:33.509
 the Rhine Valley itself as here in the Alexander Technique they learn in the 

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:34.869
 To be balance 

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:38.419
 and of course I do not want to trade that fat out of balance 

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:41.879
 I am in balance now, of course, it is natural "The last year was 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:47.119
 and the splendor of the other side is also given as a rider concerns weight 

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:50.549
 Others that the help on the creates it drives 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:55.419
 Then of course Andersen can do it with other means 

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:55.920
 work 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.530
 then it is important that I survive so far the bone is the whole 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.319
 also clearly do not feel 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:06.129
 unnecessarily way to the 4 1 percent and I have unnecessary "wrong" on the field 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:07.109
 influence 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:11.479
 now that is and fine dialogue process between team animal and me 

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:15.319
 that the percent was more and more refined, that's the point 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:17.259
 Thank you very much 

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:18.220
 that's how it goes 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.870
 Aleksandar Denic essentially because Pala have to be the same abroad 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.340
 the Alexander Technique is not yet a treatment, but rather 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:26.509
 a lesson 

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:28.039
 and then lessons 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:30.870
 Apel will keep learning how can I do that 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.639
 you can learn with at all 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:36.779
 the Hans in short that I do not 

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:38.719
 So, Arndt 

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:39.669
 do not do 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:40.550
 and 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.300
 by not doing 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.930
 To achieve things 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.830
 is different than socialized here, these are usually so socialized 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.220
 that we always do something 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.300
 need to achieve something 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.069
 and in Alexander Technique 

00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:59.240
 you realize that you have a table and way too much you do 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.029
 Things with too much effort do that one 

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:07.509
 the habits that they have built up are the ones they restrict 

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:10.549
 Organism in its function he feels as a woman 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.270
 and insofar 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:13.999
 then you deal with it 

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:15.589
 be anti users 

00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:20.469
 like to refine so that one this disturbance one inflicts oneself 

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:21.620
 just like one 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.740
 An expansion based rider so similar to a horse in his new exhibit 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.960
 Under certain circumstances we go ourselves and we feel our own 

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:32.509
 Track down McLaren man 

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:36.879
 and then to leave out and in that way one comes in his palace and upright and 

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:38.779
 I do not do that 

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:40.470
 and also not waived the right to vote 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:41.970
 in shape is out here 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:43.089
 we talk yes 

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:46.139
 later still on to a dear viewer if they are more on the subject 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.870
 Learn Alexander Technique 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:49.820
 if she once 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.789
 a free introductory talk 

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:54.020
 To get around then 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.089
 Just get in touch here in the center 

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:59.229
 for Alexander Tschäppät you will find the contact details below 

00:05:59.229 --> 00:05:59.780
 once again 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.190
 Of course we only have several focal points today 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:04.180
 Industry Interview 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:08.539
 so if we detail him in further parts on the one hand this center 

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:13.000
 and we show them how a lesson in Alexander Technique 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.240
 that's how it works 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.259
 They can get together already on the YouTubes swim from 

00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:21.259
 Center for all 20 

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:35.879
 therefore, it is just the strength of the alternative plan that made the numbers better 

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:38.059
 Alexander hour 

00:06:38.059 --> 00:06:41.189
 At the same time, you also want to learn to act it yourself 

00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:43.689
 the alternative one can always and everywhere
