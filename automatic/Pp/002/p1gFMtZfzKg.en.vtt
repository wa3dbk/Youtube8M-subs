00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
got another little trick slash bleach

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.820 
got another little trick slash bleach
whatever<00:00:06.240> you<00:00:06.359> want<00:00:06.540> to<00:00:06.629> call<00:00:06.839> it<00:00:07.049> for<00:00:07.680> you

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
whatever you want to call it for you

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.790 
whatever you want to call it for you
guys<00:00:08.040> so<00:00:08.940> um<00:00:09.240> if<00:00:09.690> it's<00:00:10.260> basically<00:00:10.679> a

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
guys so um if it's basically a

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.959 
guys so um if it's basically a
duplication<00:00:11.490> glitch<00:00:11.730> um<00:00:12.349> so<00:00:13.349> I<00:00:13.969> would

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
duplication glitch um so I would

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.630 
duplication glitch um so I would
normally<00:00:15.150> be<00:00:15.450> against<00:00:15.929> this<00:00:16.080> but<00:00:16.800> since<00:00:17.250> the

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
normally be against this but since the

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.349 
normally be against this but since the
items<00:00:18.060> in<00:00:18.240> this<00:00:18.359> game<00:00:18.570> are<00:00:18.810> so<00:00:19.400> like<00:00:20.400> I<00:00:20.730> mean

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
items in this game are so like I mean

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.210 
items in this game are so like I mean
eventually<00:00:21.570> you<00:00:22.080> run<00:00:22.320> out<00:00:22.380> of<00:00:22.560> items<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.160> you

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
eventually you run out of items and you

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.349 
eventually you run out of items and you
will<00:00:23.400> have<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:23.670> start<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:23.970> new<00:00:24.119> game

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
will have to start a new game

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.170 
will have to start a new game
so<00:00:25.050> I<00:00:25.380> actually<00:00:26.130> kind<00:00:26.550> of<00:00:26.640> like<00:00:26.789> this<00:00:26.939> glitch

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
so I actually kind of like this glitch

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.660 
so I actually kind of like this glitch
because<00:00:27.390> it<00:00:27.510> completely<00:00:27.930> it<00:00:28.320> prolongs<00:00:29.010> that<00:00:29.460> a

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
because it completely it prolongs that a

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.590 
because it completely it prolongs that a
lot<00:00:30.650> like<00:00:31.650> it<00:00:31.890> basically<00:00:32.550> doubles<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.300> amount

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
lot like it basically doubles the amount

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.420 
lot like it basically doubles the amount
of<00:00:33.719> time<00:00:33.989> you<00:00:34.230> can<00:00:34.380> stay<00:00:34.649> alive<00:00:34.770> in<00:00:35.219> this<00:00:35.309> game

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
of time you can stay alive in this game

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.260 
of time you can stay alive in this game
and<00:00:36.079> what<00:00:37.079> it<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:37.320> is<00:00:37.530> this<00:00:37.680> basically<00:00:38.190> so<00:00:38.969> if

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
and what it is is this basically so if

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.360 
and what it is is this basically so if
you<00:00:39.450> find<00:00:39.690> materials<00:00:40.350> you<00:00:40.649> obviously<00:00:41.190> have

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
you find materials you obviously have

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.799 
you find materials you obviously have
the<00:00:41.399> ability<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:41.910> call<00:00:42.210> home<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.690> have<00:00:42.780> your

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
the ability to call home and have your

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.080 
the ability to call home and have your
scavengers<00:00:43.800> come<00:00:44.040> get<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.489> stuff<00:00:44.520> for<00:00:45.030> you

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
scavengers come get the stuff for you

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.619 
scavengers come get the stuff for you
okay

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
okay

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.560 
okay
so<00:00:46.050> what<00:00:46.800> you<00:00:46.920> can<00:00:47.070> do<00:00:47.250> is<00:00:47.489> this<00:00:47.760> it's<00:00:48.390> pretty

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
so what you can do is this it's pretty

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.319 
so what you can do is this it's pretty
simple<00:00:48.989> you<00:00:49.230> just<00:00:49.500> call<00:00:50.399> your<00:00:50.579> scavengers<00:00:51.210> to

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
simple you just call your scavengers to

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.170 
simple you just call your scavengers to
come<00:00:51.510> get<00:00:51.690> it<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:52.770> know<00:00:53.460> your<00:00:53.670> guy<00:00:53.820> will<00:00:53.879> say

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
come get it you know your guy will say

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
another one um they basically go there

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.030 
another one um they basically go there
and<00:01:26.790> pick<00:01:26.970> up<00:01:27.180> like<00:01:27.750> what<00:01:28.140> was<00:01:28.320> supposed<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.890> be

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
and pick up like what was supposed to be

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.830 
and pick up like what was supposed to be
there<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:29.850> know<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.270> was<00:01:30.420> supposed<00:01:30.750> to

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
there and it you know it was supposed to

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.810 
there and it you know it was supposed to
be<00:01:30.990> supplies<00:01:31.409> but<00:01:31.770> technically<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.549> picked

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
be supplies but technically you picked

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.999 
be supplies but technically you picked
up<00:01:32.970> those<00:01:33.119> supplies<00:01:33.299> too<00:01:33.840> so<00:01:34.439> you're<00:01:34.619> doubling

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
up those supplies too so you're doubling

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.030 
up those supplies too so you're doubling
what<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.549> have<00:01:35.729> so<00:01:36.119> I<00:01:36.530> kind<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.650> like<00:01:37.799> this

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
what you have so I kind of like this

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.460 
what you have so I kind of like this
glitch<00:01:38.310> because<00:01:38.579> you<00:01:39.299> eventually<00:01:39.630> completely

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
glitch because you eventually completely

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.370 
glitch because you eventually completely
run<00:01:40.710> out<00:01:40.740> of<00:01:40.950> materials<00:01:41.960> you<00:01:42.960> almost

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
run out of materials you almost

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.649 
run out of materials you almost
completely<00:01:43.799> run<00:01:44.040> out<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.189> ammo<00:01:45.000> in<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.390> end<00:01:45.509> of

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
completely run out of ammo in the end of

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.270 
completely run out of ammo in the end of
the<00:01:45.720> game<00:01:45.869> because<00:01:46.049> there's<00:01:46.500> some<00:01:46.890> ways<00:01:47.070> to

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
the game because there's some ways to

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.550 
the game because there's some ways to
get<00:01:47.399> ammunition<00:01:48.049> even<00:01:49.049> if<00:01:49.140> everything<00:01:49.380> is

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
get ammunition even if everything is

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.710 
get ammunition even if everything is
depleted<00:01:50.040> but<00:01:50.310> it's<00:01:50.579> pretty<00:01:50.820> much<00:01:51.000> over<00:01:51.240> and

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
depleted but it's pretty much over and

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.170 
depleted but it's pretty much over and
it's<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.500> same<00:01:52.680> with<00:01:52.829> my<00:01:53.040> medication<00:01:53.880> you

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
it's the same with my medication you

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.139 
it's the same with my medication you
can't<00:01:54.360> really<00:01:54.479> get<00:01:54.659> meds<00:01:55.460> so<00:01:56.460> when<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:56.969> game

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
can't really get meds so when the game

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.620 
can't really get meds so when the game
