00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
scrape all the training so we're going

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.920

to attach our balloon whisk and we are
going<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:37.170> mix<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:39.439> we're<00:01:40.439> going<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.770> mix

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
going to mix that we're going to mix

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:49.070 
going to mix that we're going to mix
that<00:01:41.040> on<00:01:41.340> high<00:01:41.810> 15<00:01:42.810> minutes

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.890 

so<00:01:50.080> it<00:01:50.260> meanwhile<00:01:50.740> preheat<00:01:51.490> your<00:01:51.850> oven<00:01:51.910> to<00:01:52.420> 180

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900

so as you can see the pavlova mixture is
looking<00:02:13.360> perfect<00:02:13.600> this<00:02:14.230> is<00:02:14.290> the<00:02:14.470> consistency

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
looking perfect this is the consistency

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.790 
looking perfect this is the consistency
that<00:02:15.370> you<00:02:15.640> want<00:02:15.880> it's<00:02:16.240> nice<00:02:16.960> and<00:02:17.290> thick<00:02:17.560> and

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
that you want it's nice and thick and

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.740 
that you want it's nice and thick and
very<00:02:18.250> stiff<00:02:18.700> and<00:02:18.940> yep<00:02:19.600> so<00:02:19.900> that's<00:02:20.200> perfect

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
very stiff and yep so that's perfect

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.570 
very stiff and yep so that's perfect
so<00:02:22.750> before<00:02:23.200> we<00:02:23.320> put<00:02:23.470> our<00:02:23.530> pavlova<00:02:24.160> mixture

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580

so before we put our pavlova mixture
onto<00:02:24.940> some<00:02:25.120> baking<00:02:25.390> paper<00:02:25.540> we're<00:02:25.930> just<00:02:26.080> going

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
onto some baking paper we're just going

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.680 
onto some baking paper we're just going
to<00:02:26.350> draw<00:02:26.590> a<00:02:26.830> 20<00:02:27.280> centimeter<00:02:27.760> diameter<00:02:28.090> circle

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
to draw a 20 centimeter diameter circle

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.680 
to draw a 20 centimeter diameter circle
onto<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:29.710> base<00:02:29.890> and<00:02:29.920> paper<00:02:30.190> and<00:02:30.520> yeah<00:02:31.480> that

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
onto the base and paper and yeah that

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.330 
onto the base and paper and yeah that
should<00:02:31.900> just<00:02:32.050> give<00:02:32.230> us<00:02:32.350> a<00:02:32.440> guide<00:02:32.620> off<00:02:32.830> where<00:02:33.100> to

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
should just give us a guide off where to

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.890 
should just give us a guide off where to
put<00:02:33.520> our<00:02:33.550> pavlova<00:02:34.270> on<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:34.630> baking<00:02:34.900> paper

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.390

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
so I've placed my piece of baking paper

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.640 
so I've placed my piece of baking paper
onto<00:02:41.880> a<00:02:42.000> baking<00:02:42.210> tray<00:02:42.510> and<00:02:43.230> what<00:02:43.350> we're<00:02:43.500> going

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
onto a baking tray and what we're going

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:44.810 
onto a baking tray and what we're going
to<00:02:43.680> do<00:02:43.830> is<00:02:44.070> we're<00:02:44.220> just<00:02:44.250> going<00:02:44.520> to<00:02:44.610> put<00:02:44.730> our

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820

pavlova<00:02:45.330> mixture<00:02:45.690> onto<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.290> baking<00:02:46.650> paper

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
pavlova mixture onto the baking paper

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.040 
pavlova mixture onto the baking paper
and<00:02:47.490> we're<00:02:47.760> just<00:02:47.880> kind<00:02:48.090> of<00:02:48.120> even<00:02:48.540> it<00:02:48.660> out<00:02:48.810> with

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
and we're just kind of even it out with

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:57.290 
and we're just kind of even it out with
the<00:02:49.170> back<00:02:49.320> of<00:02:49.500> a<00:02:49.590> spatula<00:02:50.160> or<00:02:50.400> spoon

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
so now we're going to put it in the oven

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.210 
so now we're going to put it in the oven
at<00:03:00.120> 180<00:03:00.570> degrees<00:03:01.020> Celsius<00:03:01.500> for<00:03:01.530> about<00:03:01.830> 10

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220

at 180 degrees Celsius for about 10
minutes<00:03:02.930> after<00:03:03.930> the<00:03:04.440> 10<00:03:04.650> minutes<00:03:04.680> reduce<00:03:05.430> the

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
minutes after the 10 minutes reduce the

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.490 
minutes after the 10 minutes reduce the
heat<00:03:05.760> to<00:03:05.870> 150<00:03:06.870> degrees<00:03:07.230> Celsius

heat to 150 degrees Celsius

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.710 
heat to 150 degrees Celsius
and<00:03:10.360> bake<00:03:11.360> for<00:03:11.390> another<00:03:11.900> 45<00:03:12.710> minutes

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.449 

so<00:03:16.720> when<00:03:17.080> you<00:03:17.170> take<00:03:17.349> your<00:03:17.410> pavlova<00:03:18.069> out<00:03:18.220> of<00:03:18.370> the

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
so when you take your pavlova out of the

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.280 
so when you take your pavlova out of the
oven<00:03:18.610> it<00:03:18.940> should<00:03:19.000> somewhat<00:03:19.720> look<00:03:19.870> like<00:03:20.050> this

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
oven it should somewhat look like this

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:28.970 
oven it should somewhat look like this
and<00:03:20.560> it<00:03:20.709> will<00:03:20.830> cool<00:03:21.040> pretty<00:03:21.400> quickly

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.080 

so<00:03:29.980> I've<00:03:30.069> just<00:03:30.129> got<00:03:30.489> some<00:03:30.700> thickened<00:03:31.060> cream

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
so I've just got some thickened cream

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.970 
so I've just got some thickened cream
here<00:03:31.540> and<00:03:31.900> I'm<00:03:32.050> just<00:03:32.260> gonna<00:03:32.440> put<00:03:32.680> that<00:03:32.709> into

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
here and I'm just gonna put that into

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.880 
here and I'm just gonna put that into
the<00:03:33.190> mixer<00:03:33.610> and<00:03:33.879> let<00:03:34.690> it<00:03:34.810> mix<00:03:34.989> for<00:03:35.140> about<00:03:35.500> a<00:03:35.530> few

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
the mixer and let it mix for about a few

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:46.600 
the mixer and let it mix for about a few
minutes<00:03:36.280> or<00:03:36.640> until<00:03:36.910> there's<00:03:37.510> just<00:03:37.599> soft<00:03:38.050> peaks

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:51.040 

you

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.110 

so<00:03:51.740> your<00:03:51.980> crane<00:03:52.280> should<00:03:52.550> look<00:03:52.670> like<00:03:52.700> this

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
so your crane should look like this

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.940 
so your crane should look like this
after<00:03:53.630> it's<00:03:53.750> been<00:03:53.930> whipped

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950
