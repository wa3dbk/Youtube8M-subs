00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
getting plastic surgery where that is

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.810 
getting plastic surgery where that is
one<00:00:36.989> of<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.200> major<00:00:37.350> changes<00:00:37.920> day<00:00:38.129> more<00:00:38.640> men

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
one of the major changes day more men

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.869 
one of the major changes day more men
are<00:00:39.000> having<00:00:39.360> aesthetic<00:00:39.840> surgery<00:00:40.020> procedures

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
are having aesthetic surgery procedures

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:43.400 
are having aesthetic surgery procedures
probably<00:00:41.879> two<00:00:42.090> main<00:00:42.360> reasons<00:00:42.690> one<00:00:43.260> is

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
probably two main reasons one is

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.380 
probably two main reasons one is
professional<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.280> others<00:00:44.520> is<00:00:44.789> social

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
professional and the others is social

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.900 
professional and the others is social
and<00:00:46.140> certainly<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:47.219> youth<00:00:47.460> oriented

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
and certainly the the youth oriented

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.299 
and certainly the the youth oriented
society<00:00:48.450> that<00:00:48.989> we<00:00:49.170> live<00:00:49.410> in<00:00:49.469> today<00:00:49.829> has

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
society that we live in today has

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.939 
society that we live in today has
prompted<00:00:50.969> men<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.510> want<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.780> look<00:00:51.930> better<00:00:52.199> and

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
prompted men to want to look better and

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.920 
prompted men to want to look better and
certainly<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.730> corporate<00:00:54.120> board<00:00:54.390> rooms<00:00:54.690> have

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
certainly the corporate board rooms have

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.930 
certainly the corporate board rooms have
been<00:00:55.079> invaded<00:00:56.010> by<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.370> concept<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.469> power

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
been invaded by the concept of power

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.630 
been invaded by the concept of power
coming<00:00:59.940> from<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.390> youthful<00:01:00.870> source<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.190> people

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
coming from a youthful source and people

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.429 
coming from a youthful source and people
who<00:01:02.789> feel<00:01:03.149> better<00:01:03.449> about<00:01:03.600> themselves<00:01:03.719> and

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
who feel better about themselves and

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.700 
who feel better about themselves and
look<00:01:04.830> better<00:01:05.159> tend<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:06.030> have<00:01:06.570> that<00:01:06.600> image<00:01:07.020> hmm

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
look better tend to have that image hmm

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.859 
look better tend to have that image hmm
so<00:01:08.100> certainly<00:01:08.640> aesthetic<00:01:09.150> surgery<00:01:09.390> plays<00:01:09.840> a

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
so certainly aesthetic surgery plays a

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.140 
so certainly aesthetic surgery plays a
real<00:01:10.260> role<00:01:10.500> in<00:01:10.860> in<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.549> professional<00:01:12.119> world

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
real role in in the professional world

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.580 
real role in in the professional world
but<00:01:12.570> you<00:01:12.689> probably<00:01:12.900> heard<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.140> in<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.380> past

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
but you probably heard it in the past

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.710 
but you probably heard it in the past
dr.<00:01:13.799> that<00:01:14.189> some<00:01:14.729> guys<00:01:14.909> kind<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.270> reluctant<00:01:15.450> to

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
dr. that some guys kind of reluctant to

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.450 
dr. that some guys kind of reluctant to
have<00:01:15.840> plastic<00:01:16.290> surgery<00:01:16.320> much<00:01:16.799> more<00:01:17.040> so<00:01:17.220> than

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
have plastic surgery much more so than

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.179 
have plastic surgery much more so than
women<00:01:18.200> what's<00:01:19.200> working<00:01:19.530> here<00:01:19.890> while<00:01:20.070> we're

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
women what's working here while we're

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.980 
women what's working here while we're
men<00:01:20.460> that<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.880> last<00:01:21.119> be<00:01:21.330> dragged<00:01:21.600> into<00:01:21.840> the

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.140 
men that the last be dragged into the
operating<00:01:22.320> room<00:01:22.520> well<00:01:23.520> Dave<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:23.790> think<00:01:24.030> it's

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
operating room well Dave I think it's

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.840 
operating room well Dave I think it's
just<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.509> matter<00:01:24.720> of<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.500> concepts<00:01:26.189> changing

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
just a matter of the concepts changing

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.719 
just a matter of the concepts changing
within<00:01:27.030> our<00:01:27.299> society<00:01:27.770> first<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.979> ladies<00:01:29.549> were

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
having aesthetic surgery didn't talk

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.469 
having aesthetic surgery didn't talk
about<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:31.829> then<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.520> magazine<00:01:33.000> started<00:01:33.420> to

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
about it then the magazine started to

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.690 
about it then the magazine started to
popularize<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.320> procedures<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.340> the

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.069 
talking about it is it because of me
really<00:01:41.369> in<00:01:41.490> our<00:01:41.640> society<00:01:42.210> most<00:01:42.689> Western

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
really in our society most Western

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.630 
really in our society most Western
cultures<00:01:43.829> I<00:01:43.950> mean<00:01:44.100> there<00:01:44.220> was<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.399> lot<00:01:44.460> more
