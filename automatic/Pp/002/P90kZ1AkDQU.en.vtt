hi guys this is Ron I'm inside my house
here<00:00:03.720> today<00:00:03.990> and<00:00:04.170> I<00:00:04.230> want<00:00:04.380> to<00:00:04.440> keep<00:00:04.529> a<00:00:04.589> little

update<00:00:05.190> on<00:00:05.400> that<00:00:05.430> how<00:00:06.150> my<00:00:06.359> garden<00:00:06.750> is<00:00:06.779> growing

update on that how my garden is growing
so<00:00:07.919> I<00:00:07.950> thought<00:00:08.220> the<00:00:08.370> best<00:00:08.400> way<00:00:08.670> to<00:00:08.790> do<00:00:09.000> that<00:00:09.179> is

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
so I thought the best way to do that is

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.330

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
pick them later and keep on eat them so

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.400 
pick them later and keep on eat them so
I<00:03:13.940> still<00:03:14.239> haven't<00:03:14.450> figured<00:03:14.630> out<00:03:14.840> why<00:03:15.020> it<00:03:15.080> isn't

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
I still haven't figured out why it isn't

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.800 
I still haven't figured out why it isn't
growing<00:03:15.530> high<00:03:15.830> but<00:03:16.820> at<00:03:16.910> least<00:03:17.090> it's<00:03:17.330> producing

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
growing high but at least it's producing

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.050 
growing high but at least it's producing
really<00:03:18.650> really<00:03:18.860> good<00:03:19.040> corn<00:03:19.310> I<00:03:19.519> guess<00:03:19.700> that<00:03:19.880> was

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
really really good corn I guess that was

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.510 
really really good corn I guess that was
the<00:03:20.090> mission
