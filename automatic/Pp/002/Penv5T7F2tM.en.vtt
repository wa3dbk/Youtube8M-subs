right<00:00:23.760> there<00:00:23.970> so<00:00:24.180> we'll<00:00:24.810> see<00:00:24.960> how<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.199> game

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
right there so we'll see how the game

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.290 
right there so we'll see how the game
the<00:00:25.619> evens<00:00:25.949> out<00:00:26.070> right<00:00:26.369> here<00:00:26.550> oh<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:27.180> that's

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
the evens out right here oh and that's

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.080 
the evens out right here oh and that's
like<00:00:27.630> from<00:00:27.930> awesome<00:00:28.859> mr.<00:00:29.160> are<00:00:29.310> but<00:00:29.550> of<00:00:29.789> course

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
like from awesome mr. are but of course

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.679 
like from awesome mr. are but of course
Donna<00:00:30.630> high<00:00:30.810> enough<00:00:31.019> example<00:00:31.410> that<00:00:31.500> really

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:32.689 
Donna high enough example that really

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.029 
Donna high enough example that really
I<00:00:32.719> think<00:00:32.870> it's<00:00:32.989> setting<00:00:33.379> off<00:00:33.469> that<00:00:33.680> kind<00:00:33.920> of

00:00:34.029 --> 00:00:34.039 
I think it's setting off that kind of

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:35.590 
I think it's setting off that kind of
thing<00:00:34.190> anyway<00:00:34.460> so<00:00:34.519> he's<00:00:34.760> got<00:00:34.879> to<00:00:34.910> be<00:00:35.030> the<00:00:35.420> way

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
thing anyway so he's got to be the way

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.930 
thing anyway so he's got to be the way
it<00:00:35.629> works<00:00:35.899> is<00:00:36.079> that<00:00:36.109> multi<00:00:36.920> it<00:00:37.039> moves<00:00:37.250> now<00:00:37.519> yet

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
it works is that multi it moves now yet

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.060 
it works is that multi it moves now yet
