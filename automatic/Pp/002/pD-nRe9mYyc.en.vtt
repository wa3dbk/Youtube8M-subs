you get X number because it can cause a

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.659 
you get X number because it can cause a

over the place you don't know where your
apps<00:00:34.200> are<00:00:34.440> well<00:00:35.130> a<00:00:35.160> good<00:00:35.340> way<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.489> do<00:00:35.730> that<00:00:35.850> is

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
apps are well a good way to do that is

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.630 
apps are well a good way to do that is
to<00:00:36.059> create<00:00:36.450> apps<00:00:36.630> groups<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.649> you<00:00:38.520> can

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
to create apps groups and you can

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.700 
to create apps groups and you can
actually<00:00:38.760> give<00:00:39.090> it<00:00:39.239> an<00:00:39.329> app's<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.750> group<00:00:40.530> of

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
actually give it an app's a group of

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.560 
actually give it an app's a group of
apps<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.250> name<00:00:41.550> also<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.180> i'll<00:00:42.239> show<00:00:42.270> you<00:00:42.420> how

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
apps a name also and i'll show you how

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.779 
apps a name also and i'll show you how
to<00:00:42.629> do<00:00:42.809> that<00:00:42.930> here<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.980> way<00:00:44.100> it<00:00:44.250> works<00:00:44.520> is<00:00:44.760> you

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
to do that here the way it works is you

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.639 
to do that here the way it works is you
would<00:00:45.239> go<00:00:45.390> down<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:45.930> right<00:00:46.200> hand<00:00:46.379> corner

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
would go down to the right hand corner

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.450 
would go down to the right hand corner
here<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.070> actually<00:00:47.820> minimize<00:00:48.750> your<00:00:49.460> Metro

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460

here and actually minimize your Metro
interface<00:00:50.730> here<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.300> then<00:00:52.399> you<00:00:53.449> can<00:00:54.449> select<00:00:54.660> a

can also create a name for this group as

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.859 
can also create a name for this group as
well<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:44.070> I<00:01:44.610> can<00:01:44.759> right-click<00:01:44.939> give<00:01:45.689> it<00:01:45.750> a

well and I can right-click give it a

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.790 
well and I can right-click give it a
name<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.380> just<00:01:46.979> call<00:01:47.159> this<00:01:47.750> apps

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
name and just call this apps

name and just call this apps
group<00:01:50.580> 0<00:01:52.490> and<00:01:54.290> like<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.790> make<00:01:56.790> that<00:01:56.970> I<00:01:57.540> guess<00:01:58.140> I

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 
group 0 and like the make that I guess I

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.380 
group 0 and like the make that I guess I
could<00:01:58.470> have<00:01:58.590> gone<00:01:59.100> ahead<00:01:59.220> and<00:01:59.370> given<00:02:00.240> that<00:02:00.270> a

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
could have gone ahead and given that a

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.300 
could have gone ahead and given that a
capital<00:02:00.990> letter<00:02:01.140> instead<00:02:01.500> of<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.800> small<00:02:02.070> letter

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
capital letter instead of a small letter

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.370 
capital letter instead of a small letter
and<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:03.000> way<00:02:03.120> I<00:02:03.150> could<00:02:03.480> correct<00:02:03.780> that<00:02:03.930> is<00:02:04.080> go

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
and the way I could correct that is go

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.380 
and the way I could correct that is go
back<00:02:04.620> and<00:02:04.860> right<00:02:05.010> click<00:02:05.220> click<00:02:06.030> on<00:02:06.180> names
