there's my file you can see that it's in

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.599 
there's my file you can see that it's in
the<00:00:18.720> project<00:00:19.140> one<00:00:19.320> IBM<00:00:19.949> and<00:00:20.220> it's<00:00:20.279> in<00:00:20.520> the

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
the project one IBM and it's in the

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.960 
the project one IBM and it's in the
images<00:00:21.090> folder<00:00:21.560> within<00:00:22.560> your<00:00:22.920> Maya<00:00:23.310> projects

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
images folder within your Maya projects

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.560 
images folder within your Maya projects
so<00:00:24.779> let's<00:00:24.960> just<00:00:25.050> open<00:00:25.320> it<00:00:25.560> up<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:25.949> there's<00:00:26.570> our

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
so let's just open it up and there's our

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.700 
so let's just open it up and there's our
UV<00:00:27.869> map<00:00:28.580> know<00:00:29.580> what<00:00:29.730> I<00:00:29.760> like<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.210> do<00:00:30.359> is<00:00:30.710> change

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
UV map know what I like to do is change

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.740 
UV map know what I like to do is change
this<00:00:31.920> straight<00:00:32.279> over<00:00:34.700> as<00:00:35.700> I<00:00:35.850> go<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.149> image

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
this straight over as I go to image

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.740 
this straight over as I go to image
adjustments<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.879> invert<00:00:38.879> it<00:00:38.910> so<00:00:39.480> that<00:00:39.629> I've

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
adjustments and invert it so that I've

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.410 
adjustments and invert it so that I've
got<00:00:39.980> black<00:00:40.980> lines<00:00:41.309> on<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.820> white<00:00:42.059> background

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
got black lines on a white background

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.959 
got black lines on a white background
now<00:00:43.379> because<00:00:43.860> it's<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.100> tiff<00:00:44.340> tiff<00:00:44.730> or

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
now because it's a tiff tiff or

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.049 
now because it's a tiff tiff or
sometimes<00:00:45.480> taking<00:00:46.140> an<00:00:47.070> alpha<00:00:47.489> map<00:00:47.670> which

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
sometimes taking an alpha map which

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.690 
sometimes taking an alpha map which
you'll<00:00:48.360> make<00:00:49.219> certain<00:00:50.219> parts<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:50.579> it

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
you'll make certain parts of it

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.299 
you'll make certain parts of it
transparent<00:00:51.289> we<00:00:52.289> don't<00:00:52.410> really<00:00:52.559> need<00:00:52.829> that<00:00:52.890> so

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
transparent we don't really need that so

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.090 
transparent we don't really need that so
if<00:00:53.370> you<00:00:53.460> go<00:00:53.579> into<00:00:53.730> channels<00:00:54.379> I<00:00:55.379> think<00:00:55.949> it's

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
if you go into channels I think it's

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.779 
if you go into channels I think it's
windows<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:57.090> then<00:00:57.300> channels<00:00:57.930> down<00:00:58.440> there

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
windows and then channels down there

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:00.950 
windows and then channels down there
your<00:00:59.789> city<00:01:00.030> alpha<00:01:00.329> mapping<00:01:00.660> they're<00:01:00.809> just

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
your city alpha mapping they're just

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.140 
your city alpha mapping they're just
delete<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:03.799> that<00:01:04.799> gets<00:01:04.979> rid<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.280> it<00:01:05.460> back

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
delete that that gets rid of it back

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.960 
delete that that gets rid of it back
into<00:01:06.360> layers<00:01:07.070> now<00:01:08.070> this<00:01:08.220> background<00:01:08.490> now<00:01:08.850> I'm

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
into layers now this background now I'm

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.070 
into layers now this background now I'm
just<00:01:09.090> going<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.299> double<00:01:09.479> click<00:01:09.630> on<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:10.020> and

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
just going to double click on it and

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.710 
just going to double click on it and
just<00:01:10.320> call<00:01:10.530> it<00:01:10.560> BK<00:01:11.100> g<00:01:11.400> that<00:01:11.939> breaks<00:01:12.270> it<00:01:12.540> from

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
just call it BK g that breaks it from

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.830 
just call it BK g that breaks it from
being<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.020> standard<00:01:13.530> background<00:01:14.720> then<00:01:15.720> i'm

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
being the standard background then i'm

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.350 
being the standard background then i'm
also<00:01:15.990> going<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.259> make<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:16.619> duplicate<00:01:17.490> copy<00:01:18.060> of

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
also going to make a duplicate copy of

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.530 
also going to make a duplicate copy of
it<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:19.310> because<00:01:20.310> i<00:01:20.400> want<00:01:20.580> my<00:01:20.700> lines<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.420> be

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
it and because i want my lines to be

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.800 
it and because i want my lines to be
blacker<00:01:21.840> then<00:01:22.320> i'm<00:01:22.470> going<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:22.740> use<00:01:24.530> the<00:01:25.530> mode

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
blacker then i'm going to use the mode

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.780 
blacker then i'm going to use the mode
multiply<00:01:27.810> i<00:01:28.080> will<00:01:28.890> make<00:01:29.040> them<00:01:29.189> thicker<00:01:29.430> and

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
multiply i will make them thicker and

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:36.050 
multiply i will make them thicker and
finally<00:01:30.479> i'm<00:01:30.689> going<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.320> merge<00:01:32.189> it<00:01:32.400> down<00:01:35.030> so<00:01:36.030> i

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
finally i'm going to merge it down so i

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.050 
finally i'm going to merge it down so i
can<00:01:36.210> go<00:01:36.659> merge<00:01:37.320> down<00:01:37.740> ctrl<00:01:38.520> key<00:01:38.700> on<00:01:38.759> your

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
can go merge down ctrl key on your

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.830 
can go merge down ctrl key on your
keyboard<00:01:40.400> okay<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:41.460> there<00:01:41.759> we<00:01:41.790> got<00:01:42.000> that<00:01:42.270> so

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
keyboard okay so there we got that so

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.899 
keyboard okay so there we got that so
now<00:01:42.990> i'm<00:01:43.110> going<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.290> apply<00:01:43.520> just<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.610> colored

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
now i'm going to apply just a colored

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.460 
now i'm going to apply just a colored
background<00:01:45.090> behind<00:01:45.570> it<00:01:46.020> so<00:01:46.229> i'm<00:01:46.290> going<00:01:46.380> to

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
background behind it so i'm going to

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.429 
background behind it so i'm going to
create<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.740> new<00:01:46.950> layer<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.990> I'm<00:01:48.990> going<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.200> call

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
create a new layer and I'm going to call

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:56.389 
create a new layer and I'm going to call
it<00:01:49.909> base<00:01:51.439> on<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.619> score<00:01:52.950> color<00:01:54.320> and<00:01:55.320> I'm<00:01:56.009> going

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
it base on the score color and I'm going

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.819 
it base on the score color and I'm going
to<00:01:56.729> just<00:01:57.560> pick<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.770> kind<00:01:59.430> of<00:01:59.549> gold<00:01:59.850> a<00:02:00.500> nice<00:02:01.500> kind

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
to just pick a kind of gold a nice kind

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.500 
to just pick a kind of gold a nice kind
of<00:02:02.009> golden

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.660 

for<00:02:05.510> it<00:02:05.660> and<00:02:05.980> I'm<00:02:06.980> just<00:02:07.160> going<00:02:07.250> to<00:02:07.340> use<00:02:07.520> the

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
for it and I'm just going to use the

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.370 
for it and I'm just going to use the
paint<00:02:07.880> bucket<00:02:08.060> down<00:02:08.420> here<00:02:08.690> just<00:02:08.840> to<00:02:08.960> fill<00:02:09.259> it

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
paint bucket down here just to fill it

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.410 
paint bucket down here just to fill it
then<00:02:09.920> I'm<00:02:10.070> going<00:02:10.250> to<00:02:10.280> put<00:02:10.490> it<00:02:10.580> underneath<00:02:11.030> the

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
then I'm going to put it underneath the

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.410 
then I'm going to put it underneath the
BK<00:02:12.050> g<00:02:12.260> layer<00:02:12.530> I'm<00:02:13.190> going<00:02:13.250> to<00:02:13.430> select<00:02:13.550> the<00:02:13.790> PKG

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
BK g layer I'm going to select the PKG

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.000 
BK g layer I'm going to select the PKG
layer<00:02:14.660> and<00:02:14.960> I'm<00:02:15.140> going<00:02:15.200> to<00:02:15.440> put<00:02:15.620> it<00:02:15.710> to

layer and I'm going to put it to

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.120 
layer and I'm going to put it to
multiply<00:02:17.290> ok<00:02:18.290> now<00:02:18.440> I'm<00:02:18.500> going<00:02:18.530> to<00:02:18.710> save<00:02:18.890> this

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
multiply ok now I'm going to save this

and<00:05:07.100> now<00:05:07.730> you<00:05:08.240> can<00:05:08.420> see<00:05:09.460> that<00:05:10.460> our<00:05:10.490> gun<00:05:10.820> was

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
and now you can see that our gun was

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:18.460 
and now you can see that our gun was
coming<00:05:11.510> and<00:05:13.030> colored<00:05:14.030> quite<00:05:14.300> nicely<00:05:17.470> using

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:18.470 
coming and colored quite nicely using

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.170 
coming and colored quite nicely using
that<00:05:18.560> image<00:05:18.830> map<00:05:19.070> it's<00:05:19.370> still<00:05:19.610> got<00:05:19.790> the<00:05:19.910> lines

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 
that image map it's still got the lines

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.850 
that image map it's still got the lines
on<00:05:20.390> it<00:05:20.420> because<00:05:20.810> I've<00:05:20.960> included<00:05:21.290> those<00:05:21.620> if<00:05:21.770> I

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:21.860 
on it because I've included those if I

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.740 
on it because I've included those if I
to<00:05:21.920> turn<00:05:22.250> them<00:05:22.460> off<00:05:22.580> in<00:05:22.790> Photoshop<00:05:23.360> and<00:05:23.570> none

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 
to turn them off in Photoshop and none

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.150 
to turn them off in Photoshop and none
of<00:05:23.780> those<00:05:23.960> lines<00:05:24.290> would<00:05:24.500> have<00:05:24.650> been<00:05:24.800> included

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.160 
of those lines would have been included

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.190 
of those lines would have been included
so<00:05:26.000> I<00:05:26.030> think<00:05:26.150> you<00:05:26.450> can<00:05:26.600> see<00:05:26.810> where<00:05:27.050> we're<00:05:27.170> going

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:27.200 
so I think you can see where we're going

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.410 
so I think you can see where we're going
to<00:05:27.350> go<00:05:27.530> here<00:05:27.890> we're<00:05:28.610> actually<00:05:28.700> going<00:05:28.970> to<00:05:29.060> start

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:29.420 
to go here we're actually going to start

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:32.140 
to go here we're actually going to start
now<00:05:29.870> adding<00:05:30.290> detail<00:05:30.800> into<00:05:31.190> that<00:05:31.580> image<00:05:31.880> map

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150 
now adding detail into that image map

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.530 
now adding detail into that image map
within<00:05:32.540> Photoshop<00:05:32.900> and<00:05:33.640> then<00:05:34.640> taking<00:05:35.240> away

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:35.540 
within Photoshop and then taking away

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:38.680 
within Photoshop and then taking away
obviously<00:05:35.690> thought<00:05:36.080> the<00:05:36.410> wire<00:05:36.800> frame<00:05:37.690> and

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
obviously thought the wire frame and

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.140 
obviously thought the wire frame and
then<00:05:38.780> it<00:05:38.900> will<00:05:38.990> start<00:05:39.260> laying<00:05:39.560> it<00:05:39.740> and<00:05:40.150> we'll

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.150 
then it will start laying it and we'll

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.570 
then it will start laying it and we'll
know<00:05:41.390> exactly<00:05:41.600> where<00:05:41.990> everything<00:05:42.170> is<00:05:42.680> on<00:05:42.980> the

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
know exactly where everything is on the

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.610 
know exactly where everything is on the
map<00:05:43.760> so<00:05:44.450> that's<00:05:44.660> what<00:05:44.810> we<00:05:44.900> start<00:05:45.170> doing<00:05:45.410> next

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
map so that's what we start doing next

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.060 
map so that's what we start doing next
or<00:05:46.250> put<00:05:46.460> some<00:05:46.610> detail<00:05:47.030> into<00:05:47.300> this<00:05:47.920> change<00:05:48.920> the

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:49.070 
or put some detail into this change the

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.160 
or put some detail into this change the
colors<00:05:49.400> up<00:05:49.520> a<00:05:49.640> little<00:05:49.880> bit<00:05:50.090> change<00:05:51.050> the

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:51.170 
colors up a little bit change the

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:53.560 
colors up a little bit change the
trigger<00:05:51.410> color<00:05:51.710> maybe<00:05:52.100> put<00:05:52.370> a<00:05:52.520> handle<00:05:53.120> type

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:53.570 
trigger color maybe put a handle type

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:56.440 
trigger color maybe put a handle type
thing<00:05:53.870> in<00:05:54.020> here<00:05:54.700> maybe<00:05:55.700> something<00:05:56.210> at<00:05:56.330> the

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:56.450 
thing in here maybe something at the

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:01.480 
thing in here maybe something at the
back<00:05:56.920> a<00:05:57.920> few<00:05:58.730> little<00:05:59.320> holes<00:06:00.320> and<00:06:00.770> blemishes

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
back a few little holes and blemishes

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.540 
back a few little holes and blemishes
and<00:06:01.640> things<00:06:01.940> and<00:06:02.470> from<00:06:03.470> that<00:06:03.650> map<00:06:04.100> working

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:04.550 
and things and from that map working

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.670 
and things and from that map working
then<00:06:04.820> create<00:06:05.060> the<00:06:05.180> bump<00:06:05.390> map<00:06:05.480> I'm<00:06:06.290> also<00:06:06.500> going

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:06.680 
then create the bump map I'm also going

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.840 
then create the bump map I'm also going
to<00:06:06.740> show<00:06:06.860> you<00:06:06.950> how<00:06:07.010> to<00:06:07.130> create<00:06:07.280> a<00:06:07.370> normal<00:06:07.700> map

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:07.850 
to show you how to create a normal map

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:10.450 
to show you how to create a normal map
as<00:06:08.030> well<00:06:08.240> using<00:06:08.810> the<00:06:09.080> new<00:06:09.230> video<00:06:09.500> plugin<00:06:09.950> which

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:10.460 
as well using the new video plugin which

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.280 
as well using the new video plugin which
is<00:06:10.700> free<00:06:11.000> from<00:06:11.030> the<00:06:11.360> videos<00:06:11.630> website<00:06:12.050> i'll

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:12.290 
is free from the videos website i'll

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:13.630 
is free from the videos website i'll
give<00:06:12.440> you<00:06:12.500> details<00:06:12.680> of<00:06:13.100> that<00:06:13.130> when<00:06:13.370> we<00:06:13.460> get

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:13.640 
give you details of that when we get

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:18.310 
give you details of that when we get
onto<00:06:13.790> it<00:06:13.940> but<00:06:14.840> basically<00:06:15.020> for<00:06:15.740> now<00:06:16.570> that<00:06:17.570> is<00:06:17.900> it

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:18.320 
onto it but basically for now that is it

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.640 
onto it but basically for now that is it
so<00:06:18.860> there's<00:06:19.070> my<00:06:19.250> gum<00:06:19.810> you<00:06:20.810> can<00:06:20.990> see<00:06:21.200> rendered

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:21.650 
so there's my gum you can see rendered

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:24.260 
so there's my gum you can see rendered
out<00:06:21.770> using<00:06:22.070> default<00:06:22.550> lighting<00:06:23.030> sets

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:24.270 
out using default lighting sets

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:26.810 
out using default lighting sets
and<00:06:24.360> we'll<00:06:24.840> move<00:06:24.990> on<00:06:25.200> to<00:06:25.380> actually<00:06:26.250> blocking

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:26.820 
and we'll move on to actually blocking

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.000 
and we'll move on to actually blocking
the<00:06:27.330> colors<00:06:27.660> and<00:06:27.930> putting<00:06:28.410> the<00:06:28.470> detail<00:06:28.830> into

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:29.010 
the colors and putting the detail into

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:33.200 
the colors and putting the detail into
the<00:06:29.160> color<00:06:29.340> map<00:06:29.520> in<00:06:30.510> the<00:06:30.660> next<00:06:30.810> lesson<00:06:32.210> just

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:33.210 
the color map in the next lesson just

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:34.940 
the color map in the next lesson just
save<00:06:33.390> that<00:06:33.420> scene<00:06:33.870> and<00:06:34.050> by<00:06:34.350> the<00:06:34.410> way<00:06:34.680> just

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:34.950 
save that scene and by the way just

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:38.330 
save that scene and by the way just
clear<00:06:35.340> your<00:06:35.370> history<00:06:35.610> so<00:06:36.140> edit<00:06:37.190> delete<00:06:38.190> by

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:38.340 
clear your history so edit delete by

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:42.920 
clear your history so edit delete by
type<00:06:38.520> history<00:06:39.500> and<00:06:40.500> save<00:06:41.430> it<00:06:41.610> again<00:06:41.930> and

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:42.930 
type history and save it again and

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:46.340 
type history and save it again and
that's<00:06:43.680> it<00:06:43.890> for<00:06:44.040> this<00:06:44.160> lesson
