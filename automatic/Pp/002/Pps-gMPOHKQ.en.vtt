00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.149
 and 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.099
 hello maybe friends welcome to 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.080
 another video over eri aviation videos 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:15.049
 where are we going to have the opportunity to 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.900
 see how a twin-engine plane flies with 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:19.490
 a single engine one of the most things 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.439
 exciting that one can have in his 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.290
 pilot race is learning to fly 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:26.300
 airplanes with more than just one engine but 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.220
 the same time one has to demonstrate the 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.279
 ability to control the plane 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.110
 with a single engine and keep flying and 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.780
 get the best you can from the 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.800
 performance of that plane so in this 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.230
 video you are going to have the opportunity 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.390
 how we profile the propeller 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.000
 to be able to keep flying and follow 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.079
 keeping the plane under control I hope 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.269
 that my friends enjoy it 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.820
 Now let's pretend that we 're going 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:52.739
 of the machines on this side the machine 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.750
 the right side are the way 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.059
 we simulate them is cutting the 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.460
 mixer to simulate that was the 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.159
 right side what George has a 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.439
 specific procedure to do for 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:06.539
 be able to control the plane and follow 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.520
 flying with a single machine with the 

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:11.130
 moment they are going to see you how they separate 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.170
 that machine on the right side first thing 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.659
 that we are going to experience is a milestone 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.270
 from the plane to the engine that went off in 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.979
 this case to feel pull towards the 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.440
 right side that is the machine that is going 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.560
 to although we're going to simulate that it's going to 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:28.080
 turn off we can do this at a height 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.729
 sure in this case seven thousand feet not 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.590
 we can simulate this less than five thousand 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.649
 feet are that what we're going to do now 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.720
 let's cut the mixer on the right side 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:38.700
 simulating that the machine of the 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.230
 right side they're going to see how the plane 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.360
 it pulls for one side and for another 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.910
 while Jorge thinks about doing series 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.460
 to continue controlling the plane the 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:51.820
 ericsson power 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:54.010
 in the mixer and full on the propellers for 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.810
 try to get the best out of the 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.760
 good machine performance in this 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.880
 case Jorge is going to start putting his blue 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.470
 line which is the speed at which the 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.700
 plane keeps giving us something of 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.700
 performance with a single machine 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.000
 now it's going to confirm Jorge is going to 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.790
 reduce the power of the right side 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.600
 to confirm that it is the right that 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.130
 It went away 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.470
 effectively if there is no change in 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.820
 the plane means that he left the 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.740
 right side society put you the 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.690
 porterãa is still spinning with the air 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.210
 there is no way to realize it visually 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.490
 whether it was property or not and here Jorge 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:34.870
 is going to put his foot all the way back 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:38.400
 and the propeller that's going to have to stop 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.400
 will see me is how is it stopping 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.970
 and once the propeller stops it gives us 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.700
 the opportunity to have less drive show 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:51.480
 we have the possibility to continue flying 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:54.180
 the plane with only one machine 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:57.420
 and there they will see how the propeller is 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.909
 stop you get less rack and jorge goes 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.360
 to continue flying the plane with a 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:02.360
 single machine 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:10.170
 in this particular case Jorge has to 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:12.990
 keep there were about 115 knots to be able to 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.510
 continue to control the plane in a single 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:18.960
 we are going to give a break to the 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:21.420
 good machine so as not to abuse it 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.280
 due to the fact that it is the only one 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.690
 We have all that is left us 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.690
 we have to be careful 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.270
 now let's simulate that we're going to 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.840
 recover them and we will learn the 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:36.220
 machine and we're going to raise that propeller 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.790
 rather than to stay thinner than 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.799
 start to 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.200
 spin again the first thing that 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:44.430
 let's do is put the mixer up 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.900
 in 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.579
 and then let's put the propera is 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.409
 project also that you will see 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:52.490
 how the machine starts spinning 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:54.980
 again 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:57.890
 and at the moment of beginning to adjust the 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:00.680
 throne in the reason the idea here is no 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:03.200
 give a lot of power to the machine that is 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.820
 it turned off because it's cold to cool just 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.970
 we want to demand a lot of power from the 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:10.160
 we're just going slowly 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:12.920
 until we recover power in that 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.780
 machine outside already once we've 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.150
 recovered the good machine Jorge is going 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:20.870
 to commission to do the series for 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:23.540
 keep the plane on cruise and it's like 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:26.000
 we summarize the normal flight we do not have to 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:28.040
 do this kind of maneuvers to 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.970
 make sure the plane is still low 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:34.550
 control and flying in a single machine and 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.440
 this is how we make the feder and in this 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.129
 case elvis calderón of the profe la 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.289
 right 

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:43.229
 and this is my friends as we fly the 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:47.319
 twin-engine aircraft with only one machine 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:49.989
 here in the us the demand that still 

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:52.839
 a twin engine may be able to be 

00:04:49.989 --> 00:04:54.159
 controlled with a single machine and in 

00:04:52.839 --> 00:04:56.019
 general this is the procedure that 

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:58.659
 we do to continue our 

00:04:56.019 --> 00:05:00.819
 flight landing at our destination and 

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:03.189
 fix what went wrong in the 

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:04.509
 machine I hope this video has been of 

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:07.059
 benefit for your education 

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:09.939
 Meanwhile keep the skies 

00:05:07.059 --> 00:05:14.490
 Safe and fun places keep the sky 

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:14.490
 safe and fun and see you next time
