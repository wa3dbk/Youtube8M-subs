00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:05.410 

this<00:00:01.589> is<00:00:01.770> my<00:00:01.920> Ford<00:00:02.250> Ranger<00:00:03.589> after<00:00:04.589> the<00:00:04.740> clutch

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:05.420 
this is my Ford Ranger after the clutch

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.390 
this is my Ford Ranger after the clutch
reservoir<00:00:06.830> ran<00:00:07.830> out<00:00:08.010> of<00:00:08.040> clutch<00:00:08.370> fluid<00:00:08.639> I

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:10.400 
reservoir ran out of clutch fluid I

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.430 
reservoir ran out of clutch fluid I
refilled<00:00:11.400> it<00:00:11.580> and<00:00:11.730> tried<00:00:12.120> to<00:00:12.420> bleed<00:00:13.259> the

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
refilled it and tried to bleed the

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.939 
refilled it and tried to bleed the
clutch<00:00:14.480> master<00:00:15.480> and<00:00:15.630> slave<00:00:15.719> cylinders<00:00:16.410> by<00:00:16.890> the

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
clutch master and slave cylinders by the

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.570 
clutch master and slave cylinders by the
same<00:00:17.220> method<00:00:17.460> that<00:00:17.670> I<00:00:17.820> had<00:00:18.060> used<00:00:18.359> for<00:00:19.580> brakes

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
same method that I had used for brakes

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.480 
same method that I had used for brakes
which<00:00:20.939> is<00:00:21.150> have<00:00:21.960> somebody<00:00:22.260> pumped<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.980> clutch

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
which is have somebody pumped the clutch

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.599 
which is have somebody pumped the clutch
pedal<00:00:23.789> a<00:00:23.970> few<00:00:24.180> times<00:00:24.449> and<00:00:24.689> then<00:00:25.170> hold<00:00:25.410> it<00:00:25.609> while

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
pedal a few times and then hold it while

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.320 
pedal a few times and then hold it while
at<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.849> same<00:00:27.060> time<00:00:27.359> I<00:00:27.599> release<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:29.330> bleeder

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
at the same time I release the bleeder

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.490 
at the same time I release the bleeder
screw<00:00:31.340> down<00:00:32.340> at<00:00:32.520> slave<00:00:32.820> cylinder<00:00:33.120> I<00:00:33.510> tried

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
screw down at slave cylinder I tried

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.010 
screw down at slave cylinder I tried
this<00:00:34.710> for<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.520> couple<00:00:36.510> of<00:00:36.570> hours<00:00:36.719> yesterday<00:00:37.200> I

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
this for a couple of hours yesterday I

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:45.260 
this for a couple of hours yesterday I
with<00:00:40.020> no<00:00:40.879> positive<00:00:42.440> result<00:00:43.440> I<00:00:44.059> went<00:00:45.059> through

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
with no positive result I went through

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.240 
with no positive result I went through
about<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.480> pint<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:46.050> brake<00:00:46.320> fluid<00:00:46.350> doing<00:00:46.950> it<00:00:47.070> too

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
about a pint of brake fluid doing it too

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.709 
about a pint of brake fluid doing it too
because<00:00:47.579> I<00:00:48.079> completely<00:00:49.079> flush<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.680> system<00:00:50.100> as

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
because I completely flush the system as

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:57.139 
because I completely flush the system as
well<00:00:51.800> but<00:00:52.800> still<00:00:53.570> no<00:00:55.190> no<00:00:56.190> positive<00:00:56.670> result<00:00:57.030> the

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
well but still no no positive result the

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.520 
well but still no no positive result the
clutch<00:00:57.390> just<00:00:57.660> went<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.079> floor<00:00:58.379> without

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
clutch just went to the floor without

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.630 
clutch just went to the floor without
disengaging<00:01:00.170> with<00:01:01.170> soft<00:01:01.530> with<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.129> very<00:01:02.399> soft

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
disengaging with soft with a very soft

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.410 
disengaging with soft with a very soft
pedal<00:01:03.030> feel<00:01:03.449> I<00:01:04.909> did<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:05.939> little<00:01:06.119> bit<00:01:06.330> of

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
pedal feel I did a little bit of

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.710 
pedal feel I did a little bit of
research<00:01:06.810> online<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.909> found<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:09.330> some

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
research online and found that some

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.580 
research online and found that some
people<00:01:09.869> have<00:01:10.229> had<00:01:10.380> luck<00:01:10.710> by<00:01:11.990> taking<00:01:12.990> the

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
people have had luck by taking the

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.010 
people have had luck by taking the
master<00:01:14.040> cylinder<00:01:14.360> apart<00:01:15.360> underneath<00:01:15.840> the

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
master cylinder apart underneath the

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.359 
master cylinder apart underneath the
pedal<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:18.470> getting<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.590> air<00:01:19.740> out<00:01:19.770> of<00:01:20.009> that

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
pedal and getting the air out of that

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.370 
pedal and getting the air out of that
some<00:01:20.970> air<00:01:21.119> can<00:01:21.330> collect<00:01:21.750> in<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.020> master

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
some air can collect in the master

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.539 
some air can collect in the master
cylinder<00:01:22.619> itself<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.400> not<00:01:23.549> be<00:01:25.040> not<00:01:26.040> be<00:01:26.189> taken

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
cylinder itself and not be not be taken

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.640 
cylinder itself and not be not be taken
out<00:01:26.670> even<00:01:26.939> when<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.180> bleed<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:28.259> clutch

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
out even when you bleed the clutch

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.319 
out even when you bleed the clutch
cylinder<00:01:29.640> in<00:01:30.110> the<00:01:31.110> traditional<00:01:31.560> method<00:01:32.329> so

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
cylinder in the traditional method so

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.420 
cylinder in the traditional method so
I'm<00:01:33.450> going<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.840> try<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.140> perform<00:01:34.860> this<00:01:35.100> and

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
I'm going to try to perform this and

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.789 
I'm going to try to perform this and
hopefully<00:01:35.939> I'll<00:01:36.090> have<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.600> working<00:01:37.140> truck<00:01:37.409> by

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
hopefully I'll have a working truck by

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.789 
hopefully I'll have a working truck by
the<00:01:37.890> time<00:01:38.130> it's<00:01:38.310> over<00:01:38.990> so<00:01:39.990> this<00:01:40.200> is<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.560> master

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
the time it's over so this is the master

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.420 
the time it's over so this is the master
cylinder<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:42.619> presumably<00:01:43.619> there's<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.159> little

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
cylinder and presumably there's a little

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.850 
cylinder and presumably there's a little
bit<00:01:44.549> of<00:01:44.640> air<00:01:44.880> in<00:01:45.540> there<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.500> that's<00:01:46.649> what's

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
bit of air in there and that's what's

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.620 
bit of air in there and that's what's
causing<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.399> soft<00:01:47.700> pedal<00:01:48.509> feel<00:01:50.420> we<00:01:51.420> need<00:01:51.600> to

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
causing the soft pedal feel we need to

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.920 
causing the soft pedal feel we need to
access<00:01:52.909> underneath<00:01:54.500> this<00:01:56.390> starter<00:01:57.390> interlock

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
access underneath this starter interlock

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
access underneath this starter interlock
switch<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.710> snap<00:01:59.579> ring<00:02:00.350> which<00:02:01.350> will<00:02:01.590> release

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
switch a snap ring which will release

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.130 
switch a snap ring which will release
the<00:02:02.250> piston<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.149> then<00:02:03.630> we<00:02:03.750> can<00:02:03.899> pull<00:02:04.110> the

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
the piston and then we can pull the

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.319 
the piston and then we can pull the
piston<00:02:04.649> out<00:02:04.860> of<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.100> master<00:02:05.369> cylinder<00:02:05.759> enough

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
piston out of the master cylinder enough

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.650 
piston out of the master cylinder enough
that<00:02:07.290> will<00:02:07.640> bring<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.789> fluid<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.479> very

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
that will bring the fluid to the very

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.340 
that will bring the fluid to the very
top<00:02:09.899> of<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.140> master<00:02:10.530> cylinder

need to remove the inner lock switch to

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.950 
need to remove the inner lock switch to
do<00:02:17.470> that<00:02:17.710> you<00:02:17.950> just<00:02:18.100> pull<00:02:18.430> it<00:02:18.550> up<00:02:19.140> turn<00:02:20.140> it<00:02:21.960> and

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
do that you just pull it up turn it and

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.510 
do that you just pull it up turn it and
then<00:02:22.990> there's<00:02:23.740> this<00:02:24.010> little<00:02:24.900> slide<00:02:25.900> clip<00:02:26.520> that

then there's this little slide clip that

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.600 
then there's this little slide clip that
needs<00:02:27.820> to<00:02:28.000> be<00:02:28.120> removed<00:02:28.920> you<00:02:29.920> just<00:02:30.130> squeeze

a screwdriver it took a little bit of
work<00:04:42.770> but<00:04:43.770> I<00:04:44.540> found<00:04:45.540> that<00:04:45.660> if<00:04:45.780> I<00:04:45.900> push<00:04:46.200> down<00:04:46.310> the

the piston that allowed me to push my

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.440 
the piston that allowed me to push my
screwdriver<00:04:53.370> into<00:04:53.580> the<00:04:53.669> holes<00:04:53.910> of<00:04:54.030> the<00:04:54.150> snap
