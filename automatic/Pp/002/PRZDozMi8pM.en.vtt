harsh<00:02:07.209> him<00:02:07.569> to<00:02:07.659> get<00:02:07.749> a<00:02:07.779> drive-through<00:02:08.410> penalty

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
harsh him to get a drive-through penalty

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.460 
harsh him to get a drive-through penalty
for<00:02:09.039> that<00:02:09.240> I<00:02:10.240> don't<00:02:11.020> know<00:02:11.080> what<00:02:11.170> you<00:02:11.290> guys

stroke<00:03:16.340> of<00:03:16.370> genius<00:03:16.489> I<00:03:16.940> thought<00:03:17.180> to<00:03:17.360> do<00:03:17.540> his<00:03:17.840> dr

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
stroke of genius I thought to do his dr

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.839 
stroke of genius I thought to do his dr
fruit<00:03:18.500> powered<00:03:18.799> he<00:03:18.950> went<00:03:19.129> berry<00:03:19.310> color<00:03:19.549> was

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
going for his first pit stop because I

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:23.949 
going for his first pit stop because I
think<00:03:21.950> even<00:03:22.099> then<00:03:22.489> Bill's<00:03:23.090> River<00:03:23.450> Barack<00:03:23.810> hell

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959
