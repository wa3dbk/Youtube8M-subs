how does it relate to ipv6 well

how does it relate to ipv6 well
somebody's<00:02:29.849> coming<00:02:30.120> from<00:02:30.239> an<00:02:30.359> ipv6<00:02:30.810> only

your ipv4 only web server they're not

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
going to be able to do it now the

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.399 
going to be able to do it now the
reality<00:02:38.609> is<00:02:38.879> that<00:02:39.269> today<00:02:39.599> most<00:02:39.959> of<00:02:40.109> our<00:02:40.230> web

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:40.409 
reality is that today most of our web

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:43.429 
reality is that today most of our web
content<00:02:40.980> is<00:02:41.159> on<00:02:41.400> ipv4<00:02:42.030> only<00:02:42.629> web<00:02:42.780> servers<00:02:43.200> and

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:43.439 
content is on ipv4 only web servers and

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:46.160 
content is on ipv4 only web servers and
so<00:02:43.980> somewhere<00:02:44.700> in<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:44.939> mix<00:02:45.150> there<00:02:45.720> is<00:02:45.900> some

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
so somewhere in the mix there is some

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.280 
so somewhere in the mix there is some
kind<00:02:46.439> of<00:02:46.500> gateway<00:02:46.980> that<00:02:47.250> translates<00:02:48.290> ipv6

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
kind of gateway that translates ipv6

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.729 
kind of gateway that translates ipv6
queries<00:02:49.769> into<00:02:50.150> v4<00:02:51.180> and<00:02:51.620> translates<00:02:52.620> of

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
queries into v4 and translates of

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.979 
queries into v4 and translates of
traffic<00:02:53.099> back<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.459> other<00:02:53.609> way<00:02:53.720> but<00:02:54.720> just

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
traffic back the other way but just

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.949 
traffic back the other way but just
inherent<00:02:55.919> in<00:02:56.069> this<00:02:56.220> is<00:02:56.459> some<00:02:57.180> kind<00:02:57.540> of<00:02:57.629> delay

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
inherent in this is some kind of delay

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.789 
inherent in this is some kind of delay
and<00:02:58.319> so<00:02:58.609> the<00:02:59.609> ideal<00:03:00.209> solution<00:03:00.870> is<00:03:01.109> to<00:03:01.590> make

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
and so the ideal solution is to make

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.039 
and so the ideal solution is to make
your<00:03:02.040> web<00:03:02.220> content<00:03:02.489> available<00:03:03.120> over<00:03:03.239> both<00:03:03.480> v6

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
your web content available over both v6

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:06.440 
your web content available over both v6
and<00:03:04.290> v4<00:03:04.439> so<00:03:05.370> that<00:03:05.489> people<00:03:05.730> can<00:03:05.849> just<00:03:05.879> get<00:03:06.120> to<00:03:06.329> it

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
and v4 so that people can just get to it

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.179 
and v4 so that people can just get to it
over<00:03:06.599> whichever<00:03:07.079> protocol<00:03:07.650> they<00:03:07.829> happen<00:03:08.129> to

over whichever protocol they happen to

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:10.429 
over whichever protocol they happen to
be<00:03:08.280> using<00:03:08.489> without<00:03:08.849> any<00:03:09.239> of<00:03:09.359> the<00:03:09.450> delays<00:03:09.810> that

00:03:10.429 --> 00:03:10.439 
be using without any of the delays that

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:13.520 
be using without any of the delays that
could<00:03:10.650> be<00:03:10.769> caused<00:03:11.010> by<00:03:11.189> gateways<00:03:11.700> now<00:03:12.629> if

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
could be caused by gateways now if

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.199 
could be caused by gateways now if
you're<00:03:13.799> not<00:03:13.980> able<00:03:14.189> to<00:03:14.400> do<00:03:14.519> that<00:03:14.639> directly<00:03:15.090> with

with a CDN another factor is that there

you're<00:04:35.430> looking<00:04:35.849> at<00:04:35.970> CDN<00:04:36.360> is<00:04:36.629> how<00:04:37.020> long<00:04:37.289> does

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
you're looking at CDN is how long does

you're looking at CDN is how long does
that<00:04:37.560> take

that take

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:39.860 
that take
are<00:04:38.340> you<00:04:38.550> talking<00:04:38.909> minutes<00:04:39.330> you<00:04:39.750> know

what level of delay will there be to get
your<00:04:46.409> updates<00:04:46.770> out<00:04:47.009> there<00:04:47.280> the<00:04:47.970> other<00:04:48.120> piece

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 
your updates out there the other piece

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:50.749 
your updates out there the other piece
is<00:04:48.509> you<00:04:48.990> are<00:04:49.259> putting<00:04:49.560> a<00:04:49.710> layer<00:04:49.919> between<00:04:50.220> your

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:50.759 
is you are putting a layer between your

content and your visitors so the

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.580 
content and your visitors so the

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
question is can the CDN provide at least
