00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:10.940
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.980
 new video 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.840
 Today I want to show you these 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.939
 simple and simple 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.009
 you can do it yourself quickly 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:22.069
 you need a smart feed first 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:27.229
 ground for your sugar and one 

00:00:22.069 --> 00:00:29.359
 library asked with the eggs to the 

00:00:27.229 --> 00:00:31.759
 necessarily should have room temperature 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:34.310
 and add two tablespoons of lukewarm water 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.890
 You have to do it all first 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.420
 be well pitched 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.670
 After a short time can be careful 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.260
 the sugar to be drizzled and 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.270
 then you have to continue mixing for so long 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.080
 so far a breezy and bright 3 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.080
 get 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.170
 then the flour can do it 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.239
 be sieved what so easy in 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.070
 one can do well and then you lift 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.070
 the menu carefully under your part 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.450
 Now you need one more 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.820
 baking paper laid baking sheet on the 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.890
 be careful to pour in here and 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.170
 so that is relatively fluid you can 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.229
 because a bit of corner flow to corner 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.390
 leave before then at 175 degrees above 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.350
 and heat for about 15 minutes 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.350
 comes in the oven 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.260
 in the meantime you can have one 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.000
 garage half-time bitter and half full 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.460
 prepare with couverture 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.040
 here in the same proportion with 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.659
 hot same pours and melt 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.520
 then allow to cool 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:39.100
 you'll get namely at the end of such a 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.890
 Nice firm cream on your biscuit 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.420
 I can link floors 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.290
 But you also have another recipe 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.340
 for the garage in the infobox 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.070
 Of course, this is still missing 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:54.220
 icing for your cream of quark 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.619
 vanilla sugar and cream needed stiff 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.270
 First, the cream comes in a bowl 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.890
 and must be pitched 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.840
 and then when you realize that the cream 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.270
 slowly firmer you give and after 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.240
 after some of the cream stiffness to that 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.560
 The cream just got really nice 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.720
 then comes the quark and the vanilla 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.180
 sugar and everything must be short again 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.230
 be mixed together 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.000
 then the quarkcreme is already 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.440
 finished and should be in the meantime 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.440
 be kept refrigerator 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.530
 if then the bizkit floor finished 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.480
 baked you should cool this briefly 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.610
 and then you can with a very low 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.269
 or a glass of small circles from the dough 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.269
 outdo 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:41.319
 with the help of an angle range or too 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:43.060
 a cake server you can then 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.519
 Carefully the cake circles from 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.230
 loosen baking paper and you have to leave the rest 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.120
 of course not throw away daniel 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.370
 make either cake pops out of it 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.180
 or just crack the cream 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.180
 beak can 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.250
 then you can open your bizkit circles 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.900
 position a plate and there 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.130
 currently not dry at all 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.290
 you do not necessarily have this 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.050
 you can drink as soon as you can 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.180
 First I spray the gallasch 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.400
 I took a star school and 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.990
 the garage in a flat circle of 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.830
 outside in on the biscuit 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.830
 distributed 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.510
 for the icing I have me then 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.520
 taken a slightly larger star school 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.070
 and here I am from the outside again 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:39.050
 splashed inside but not exactly 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:48.440
 but up to that level 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:50.090
 This beautiful icing has last 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.920
 you can still tart the mini with 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:56.050
 garnish fruits neighbor and already that 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.050
 a super delicious dessert ready 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.520
 and just this combination of the 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.950
 Quarkcreme under chocolate ganache is like that 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.540
 incredibly tasty it's worth it 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.930
 really these little kathi times 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.610
 I think if you try it 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.590
 I liked the video, let me 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.270
 a thumb up there or subscribed 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.050
 main channel so no video here 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:17.420
 miss 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:20.799
