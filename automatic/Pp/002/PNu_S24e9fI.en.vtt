00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:19.310 
ok another improvement and kind of

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.460 
ok another improvement and kind of
interesting<00:00:19.670> options<00:00:20.150> was<00:00:20.330> added<00:00:20.720> rule<00:00:20.990> 11<00:00:21.320> it

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470 
interesting options was added rule 11 it

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.220 
interesting options was added rule 11 it
is<00:00:21.740> for<00:00:22.099> local<00:00:22.400> materials<00:00:22.970> so<00:00:23.599> what<00:00:23.750> is<00:00:23.869> mean

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.230 
is for local materials so what is mean

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.940 
is for local materials so what is mean
by<00:00:24.279> global<00:00:25.279> materials<00:00:25.759> example<00:00:26.590> will<00:00:27.590> create

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:27.950 
by global materials example will create

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:33.729 
by global materials example will create
right<00:00:28.189> here<00:00:29.770> some<00:00:30.770> sphere<00:00:32.260> let's<00:00:33.260> create<00:00:33.559> a

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
right here some sphere let's create a

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:39.160 
right here some sphere let's create a
cone<00:00:34.280> right<00:00:34.700> here<00:00:35.120> and<00:00:36.550> cube<00:00:37.550> right<00:00:37.790> here<00:00:38.170> so

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
cone right here and cube right here so

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.850 
cone right here and cube right here so
here<00:00:39.410> this<00:00:39.559> objects<00:00:40.129> will<00:00:40.309> take<00:00:40.489> our<00:00:40.670> camera

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860 
here this objects will take our camera

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.700 
here this objects will take our camera
over<00:00:42.860> about<00:00:43.600> then<00:00:44.600> this<00:00:44.840> is<00:00:45.050> just<00:00:45.079> by<00:00:45.559> your

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
over about then this is just by your

over about then this is just by your
concept<00:00:46.280> and<00:00:46.489> we<00:00:46.579> often<00:00:46.910> can<00:00:47.030> log<00:00:47.239> house<00:00:47.510> can

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
concept and we often can log house can

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.319 
concept and we often can log house can
help<00:00:48.200> us<00:00:48.380> so<00:00:49.100> right<00:00:49.280> here<00:00:49.550> I<00:00:49.579> have<00:00:49.790> its<00:00:49.940> sphere

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
help us so right here I have its sphere

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:53.319 
help us so right here I have its sphere
I'm<00:00:50.740> going<00:00:51.740> pair<00:00:51.950> loaded<00:00:52.310> and<00:00:52.550> let<00:00:52.820> me<00:00:53.000> you

I'm going pair loaded and let me you

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:56.790 
I'm going pair loaded and let me you
know<00:00:53.360> what<00:00:53.570> will<00:00:54.440> create<00:00:54.800> material<00:00:55.520> new<00:00:56.060> layer

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
know what will create material new layer

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.780 
know what will create material new layer
ok<00:00:57.800> and<00:00:58.040> I'm<00:00:58.400> going<00:00:58.460> to<00:00:59.000> use<00:00:59.270> maybe<00:01:00.790> grass

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:01.790 
ok and I'm going to use maybe grass

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:08.859 
ok and I'm going to use maybe grass
layer<00:01:04.239> let's<00:01:05.239> go<00:01:05.449> ahead<00:01:05.799> vironment<00:01:07.689> all<00:01:08.689> the

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
layer let's go ahead vironment all the

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:16.810 
layer let's go ahead vironment all the
way<00:01:09.020> and<00:01:10.270> we'll<00:01:11.270> go<00:01:11.479> to<00:01:11.540> preview<00:01:15.640> so<00:01:16.640> right

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
way and we'll go to preview so right

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.730 
way and we'll go to preview so right
here<00:01:16.850> you<00:01:17.090> can<00:01:17.329> see<00:01:17.570> we<00:01:17.719> apply<00:01:17.960> this<00:01:18.020> material

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
here you can see we apply this material

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.730 
here you can see we apply this material
get<00:01:19.670> next<00:01:20.060> what<00:01:20.210> I<00:01:20.299> can<00:01:20.540> options<00:01:21.140> when<00:01:21.500> I<00:01:21.530> give

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
get next what I can options when I give

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.460 
get next what I can options when I give
this<00:01:21.920> material<00:01:22.460> I<00:01:22.580> can<00:01:23.299> make<00:01:23.479> this<00:01:23.690> a<00:01:23.870> global

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
this material I can make this a global

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.420 
this material I can make this a global
material<00:01:26.140> it<00:01:27.140> so<00:01:27.290> what<00:01:27.409> I<00:01:27.440> can<00:01:27.680> do<00:01:27.920> go<00:01:28.220> right

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
material it so what I can do go right

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.100 
material it so what I can do go right
here<00:01:28.729> and<00:01:29.620> agreed<00:01:30.620> go<00:01:31.280> make<00:01:31.760> global<00:01:32.150> so<00:01:32.840> now

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
here and agreed go make global so now

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.789 
here and agreed go make global so now
this<00:01:33.440> material<00:01:34.100> is<00:01:34.250> global<00:01:34.729> let's<00:01:35.150> copy<00:01:35.799> ok

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
this material is global let's copy ok

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:39.600 
this material is global let's copy ok
next<00:01:37.190> what<00:01:37.490> I<00:01:37.520> can<00:01:37.729> do<00:01:37.909> it's<00:01:38.180> going<00:01:38.659> inside

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
next what I can do it's going inside

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.560 
next what I can do it's going inside
actually<00:01:40.610> you<00:01:40.670> know<00:01:40.729> what<00:01:40.790> let's<00:01:41.119> cut<00:01:41.420> this

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
actually you know what let's cut this

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.260 
actually you know what let's cut this
but<00:01:41.900> you<00:01:42.080> know<00:01:42.170> just<00:01:42.440> to<00:01:43.220> make<00:01:43.340> fast<00:01:43.729> you<00:01:44.060> can

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
but you know just to make fast you can

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.440 
but you know just to make fast you can
paste<00:01:44.869> it<00:01:45.080> right<00:01:45.140> here<00:01:45.680> and<00:01:47.260> paste<00:01:48.260> right<00:01:48.560> here

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
paste it right here and paste right here

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.390 
paste it right here and paste right here
so<00:01:50.450> we'll<00:01:50.630> preview<00:01:50.990> yes<00:01:51.530> because<00:01:51.979> we<00:01:52.010> copy

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 
so we'll preview yes because we copy

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.910 
so we'll preview yes because we copy
paste<00:01:52.700> same<00:01:52.939> material<00:01:53.360> it's<00:01:54.049> going<00:01:54.470> this<00:01:54.680> way

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
paste same material it's going this way

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.000 
paste same material it's going this way
um<00:01:55.570> what<00:01:56.570> I<00:01:56.600> want<00:01:56.840> to<00:01:56.960> do<00:01:57.080> is<00:01:57.110> going<00:01:57.590> to<00:01:57.710> and<00:01:57.799> set

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 
um what I want to do is going to and set

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.710 
um what I want to do is going to and set
this<00:01:58.130> fear<00:01:58.549> example<00:01:59.119> and<00:01:59.470> on<00:02:00.470> this<00:02:00.710> material<00:02:01.400> I

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
this fear example and on this material I

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.539 
this fear example and on this material I
want<00:02:02.720> change<00:02:03.080> this<00:02:04.689> to<00:02:05.689> read<00:02:06.430> have<00:02:07.430> you

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
want change this to read have you

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:09.309 
want change this to read have you
noticed<00:02:07.820> it's<00:02:08.060> changed<00:02:08.539> on<00:02:08.750> all<00:02:08.959> of<00:02:09.200> the

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
noticed it's changed on all of the

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.520 
noticed it's changed on all of the
materials<00:02:09.890> just<00:02:10.580> for<00:02:10.849> this<00:02:10.939> layer<00:02:11.420> so<00:02:12.019> I<00:02:12.049> still

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
materials just for this layer so I still

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.979 
materials just for this layer so I still
this<00:02:12.769> is<00:02:12.829> not<00:02:13.220> my<00:02:13.489> global<00:02:14.000> material<00:02:14.510> so<00:02:14.720> i<00:02:14.780> can

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
this is not my global material so i can

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.270 
this is not my global material so i can
go<00:02:15.170> right<00:02:15.349> here<00:02:15.909> replace<00:02:16.909> it<00:02:17.090> and<00:02:17.890> if<00:02:18.890> you<00:02:19.040> see

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
go right here replace it and if you see

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.030 
go right here replace it and if you see
right<00:02:20.000> here<00:02:20.239> one<00:02:20.480> layer<00:02:20.720> still<00:02:21.230> be<00:02:21.379> but<00:02:21.829> even

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
right here one layer still be but even

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.300 
right here one layer still be but even
that's<00:02:22.459> single<00:02:22.939> layer<00:02:23.150> it<00:02:23.420> is<00:02:24.200> a<00:02:24.230> global<00:02:24.800> and

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
that's single layer it is a global and

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.550 
that's single layer it is a global and
it's<00:02:25.430> applied<00:02:25.790> everywhere<00:02:26.239> so<00:02:27.050> it's<00:02:27.200> nice

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
it's applied everywhere so it's nice

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.050 
it's applied everywhere so it's nice
when<00:02:27.890> you<00:02:27.980> start<00:02:28.220> working<00:02:28.280> with<00:02:28.730> your<00:02:28.880> range

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
when you start working with your range

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.620 
when you start working with your range
so<00:02:29.239> let's

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
so let's

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.770 
so let's
look<00:02:29.690> how<00:02:30.350> we<00:02:30.410> can<00:02:30.680> utilize<00:02:30.860> that<00:02:31.390> in<00:02:32.390> some

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
look how we can utilize that in some

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.730 
look how we can utilize that in some
project<00:02:34.060> so<00:02:35.060> valley<00:02:35.270> for<00:02:35.630> example<00:02:35.990> i<00:02:36.140> can<00:02:36.440> go

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
project so valley for example i can go

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:43.300 
project so valley for example i can go
create<00:02:38.020> right<00:02:39.020> here<00:02:39.350> one<00:02:39.590> terrain<00:02:42.310> procreate

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
create right here one terrain procreate

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.730 
create right here one terrain procreate
second<00:02:43.940> to<00:02:44.060> right<00:02:44.210> here<00:02:46.510> okay<00:02:47.510> and<00:02:48.020> maybe<00:02:48.410> one

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:48.740 
second to right here okay and maybe one

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.590 
second to right here okay and maybe one
more<00:02:48.980> I<00:02:49.220> far<00:02:50.030> away<00:02:51.520> upgrade<00:02:52.520> is<00:02:52.790> a<00:02:53.030> large<00:02:53.270> size

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
more I far away upgrade is a large size

let's click change slightly shape

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:24.420 
let's click change slightly shape
increase<00:03:18.770> size<00:03:20.560> it<00:03:21.560> without<00:03:21.860> our<00:03:23.200> terrain

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
increase size it without our terrain

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.230 
increase size it without our terrain
right<00:03:25.430> it's<00:03:25.700> point<00:03:27.100> and<00:03:28.100> we<00:03:28.910> have<00:03:29.060> this

looking okay as well let's play loaded
some<00:05:58.160> bumps<00:05:58.700> and<00:05:58.940> we'll<00:05:59.240> go<00:05:59.480> to<00:06:05.710> okay<00:06:06.710> so<00:06:07.070> this

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:07.220 
some bumps and we'll go to okay so this

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.690 
some bumps and we'll go to okay so this
your<00:06:07.370> point<00:06:07.820> five<00:06:08.770> this<00:06:09.770> one<00:06:10.040> for<00:06:10.100> Strings

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.210 
effect maybe pop up little bit for the

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.440 
effect maybe pop up little bit for the
snow<00:06:17.540> and<00:06:18.140> nice<00:06:18.890> things<00:06:19.160> is<00:06:19.340> apply<00:06:19.730> on<00:06:19.970> all<00:06:20.240> of

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:20.450 
snow and nice things is apply on all of

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:22.390 
snow and nice things is apply on all of
them<00:06:20.600> so<00:06:20.840> this<00:06:21.020> is<00:06:21.260> snow<00:06:21.470> layer<00:06:21.740> work<00:06:22.100> on<00:06:22.280> all

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.400 
them so this is snow layer work on all

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.110 
them so this is snow layer work on all
of<00:06:22.520> them<00:06:22.670> as<00:06:22.820> well<00:06:23.480> is<00:06:23.750> our<00:06:24.020> environment<00:06:24.680> and

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.120 
of them as well is our environment and

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.540 
of them as well is our environment and
this<00:06:26.120> is<00:06:26.300> gone<00:06:26.480> by<00:06:26.690> objects<00:06:27.260> so<00:06:27.410> we<00:06:27.530> can<00:06:27.710> set<00:06:28.340> by

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:28.550 
this is gone by objects so we can set by

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.120 
this is gone by objects so we can set by
materials<00:06:29.150> as<00:06:29.360> well<00:06:29.390> so<00:06:30.050> it's<00:06:30.200> apply<00:06:30.650> all<00:06:31.070> of

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:31.130 
materials as well so it's apply all of

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:34.870 
materials as well so it's apply all of
them<00:06:31.670> absolute<00:06:32.860> summit<00:06:33.860> or<00:06:34.070> we<00:06:34.550> can<00:06:34.700> go

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:34.880 
them absolute summit or we can go

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.750 
them absolute summit or we can go
relatively<00:06:35.390> to<00:06:35.720> see<00:06:35.990> it's<00:06:36.380> based<00:06:36.710> on<00:06:36.890> that<00:06:37.070> so

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:37.760 
relatively to see it's based on that so

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.770 
relatively to see it's based on that so
let's<00:06:37.940> go<00:06:38.150> reality<00:06:38.660> what<00:06:38.840> you<00:06:38.960> see<00:06:40.570> then<00:06:41.570> use

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:41.780 
let's go reality what you see then use

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:48.070 
let's go reality what you see then use
maybe<00:06:43.450> so<00:06:44.450> decrease<00:06:44.960> to<00:06:46.810> you<00:06:47.810> don't<00:06:47.990> know

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:48.080 
maybe so decrease to you don't know

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.190 
maybe so decrease to you don't know
heels<00:06:48.670> and<00:06:49.670> then<00:06:50.390> go<00:06:50.570> we<00:06:50.720> have<00:06:50.900> at<00:06:50.990> this

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:51.200 
heels and then go we have at this

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.230 
heels and then go we have at this
material<00:06:51.710> that<00:06:51.890> we<00:06:52.040> applied<00:06:52.460> in<00:06:52.730> its<00:06:52.880> applied

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:53.240 
material that we applied in its applied

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:57.760 
material that we applied in its applied
globally<00:06:53.960> true<00:06:54.770> to<00:06:55.310> all<00:06:55.520> of<00:06:55.760> them<00:06:55.910> even<00:06:56.770> when

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:57.770 
globally true to all of them even when

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:59.890 
globally true to all of them even when
I'm<00:06:57.919> going<00:06:58.250> here<00:06:58.610> you<00:06:58.760> can<00:06:59.000> see<00:06:59.210> our<00:06:59.390> modules

00:06:59.890 --> 00:06:59.900 
I'm going here you can see our modules

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:01.710 
I'm going here you can see our modules
is<00:07:00.110> different<00:07:00.500> so<00:07:00.680> I<00:07:00.710> don't<00:07:01.010> need<00:07:01.130> any<00:07:01.400> more

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:01.720 
is different so I don't need any more

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:04.720 
is different so I don't need any more
going<00:07:02.720> to<00:07:02.900> reply<00:07:03.230> all<00:07:03.500> materials<00:07:04.040> exactly<00:07:04.400> all

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:04.730 
going to reply all materials exactly all

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:07.690 
going to reply all materials exactly all
of<00:07:04.910> them<00:07:05.060> I<00:07:05.500> can<00:07:06.500> have<00:07:06.680> a<00:07:06.710> total<00:07:07.160> different<00:07:07.520> so

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:07.700 
of them I can have a total different so

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:12.940 
of them I can have a total different so
for<00:07:07.970> this<00:07:08.120> example<00:07:08.180> I<00:07:09.760> can<00:07:10.760> go<00:07:11.060> and<00:07:11.210> set<00:07:11.950> one

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:12.950 
for this example I can go and set one

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:16.750 
for this example I can go and set one
just<00:07:13.280> send<00:07:13.810> this<00:07:14.810> one<00:07:15.050> sub<00:07:15.440> tunes<00:07:15.710> but<00:07:16.580> we

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:16.760 
just send this one sub tunes but we

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:19.180 
just send this one sub tunes but we
still<00:07:17.000> have<00:07:17.300> it<00:07:17.390> exactly<00:07:17.900> the<00:07:18.050> same<00:07:18.190> having

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:19.190 
still have it exactly the same having

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:21.250 
still have it exactly the same having
different<00:07:19.580> materials<00:07:20.090> but<00:07:20.480> layers<00:07:20.810> or

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:21.260 
different materials but layers or

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.380 
different materials but layers or
whatever<00:07:21.620> some<00:07:21.890> other<00:07:22.160> ones<00:07:22.370> can<00:07:23.000> be<00:07:23.150> set

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:23.390 
whatever some other ones can be set

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:26.430 
whatever some other ones can be set
globally<00:07:23.990> and<00:07:24.200> up<00:07:24.860> I<00:07:25.100> true<00:07:25.430> all<00:07:25.640> our<00:07:25.880> scenery

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:26.440 
globally and up I true all our scenery

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.800 
globally and up I true all our scenery
for<00:07:27.440> all<00:07:27.890> object<00:07:28.610> that<00:07:28.730> we<00:07:28.940> using<00:07:29.300> so<00:07:29.690> I<00:07:29.720> think

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:29.810 
for all object that we using so I think

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:32.860 
for all object that we using so I think
this<00:07:30.320> is<00:07:30.590> as<00:07:30.890> well<00:07:31.160> it's<00:07:31.550> make<00:07:31.790> more<00:07:32.150> uniform

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:32.870 
this is as well it's make more uniform

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:36.880 
this is as well it's make more uniform
and<00:07:33.080> make<00:07:33.830> quite<00:07:34.190> a<00:07:34.250> bit<00:07:34.400> faster<00:07:34.820> work<00:07:35.890> when

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:36.890 
and make quite a bit faster work when

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:38.710 
and make quite a bit faster work when
