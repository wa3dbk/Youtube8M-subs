00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
money and blah blah blah like that so

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.369 
money and blah blah blah like that so
they<00:00:39.030> split<00:00:39.450> up<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:41.750> monsters<00:00:42.750> now<00:00:42.960> making

other<00:01:18.990> day<00:01:19.170> I<00:01:19.380> noticed<00:01:19.409> that<00:01:19.890> there's<00:01:20.070> they

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
other day I noticed that there's they

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.690 
other day I noticed that there's they
still<00:01:20.670> have<00:01:21.560> some<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.740> old<00:01:22.920> ones<00:01:23.310> that

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
still have some of the old ones that

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.700 
still have some of the old ones that
were<00:01:23.820> still<00:01:23.850> designed<00:01:24.479> by<00:01:24.630> monster<00:01:25.200> in<00:01:25.320> stock

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
were still designed by monster in stock

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.580 
were still designed by monster in stock
so<00:01:26.360> they<00:01:27.360> were<00:01:27.420> really<00:01:27.810> cheap<00:01:27.840> i<00:01:28.259> got<00:01:28.439> this

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
so they were really cheap i got this

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.740 
so they were really cheap i got this
pair<00:01:28.890> for<00:01:29.130> almost<00:01:29.549> fifty<00:01:29.970> percent<00:01:30.299> off<00:01:30.509> the

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
pair for almost fifty percent off the

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.649 
pair for almost fifty percent off the
normal<00:01:30.960> price<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:32.250> pretty<00:01:32.490> much<00:01:32.579> is<00:01:33.030> the

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
normal price and it pretty much is the

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:38.390 
normal price and it pretty much is the
exact<00:01:36.659> same<00:01:36.960> as<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.590> version<00:01:37.920> after<00:01:38.009> sewing

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
exact same as the version after sewing

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.219 
exact same as the version after sewing
now<00:01:38.549> for<00:01:38.820> I<00:01:38.850> think<00:01:39.150> four<00:01:39.390> hundred<00:01:39.659> dollars<00:01:39.689> or

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
now for I think four hundred dollars or

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.020 
now for I think four hundred dollars or
something<00:01:40.439> like<00:01:40.530> that<00:01:40.590> i<00:01:40.710> got<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:41.040> for<00:01:41.250> almost

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
something like that i got it for almost

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.139 
something like that i got it for almost
two-thirty<00:01:42.899> so<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:44.310> price<00:01:44.520> fluctuates

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
two-thirty so it the price fluctuates

two-thirty so it the price fluctuates
