to study on his own he can actually do

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.800 
to study on his own he can actually do
it<00:02:21.390> using<00:02:22.050> the<00:02:22.319> o<00:02:22.349> UK<00:02:22.890> materials<00:02:23.430> and<00:02:23.849> pass<00:02:24.599> the

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
exams life a really fast pace as many

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.020 
exams life a really fast pace as many
people<00:02:28.590> have<00:02:28.769> to<00:02:28.950> work<00:02:29.190> and<00:02:29.489> I<00:02:29.610> want<00:02:29.819> to

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
people have to work and I want to

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.520 
people have to work and I want to
improve<00:02:30.420> their<00:02:30.690> standard<00:02:31.019> of<00:02:31.049> living<00:02:31.170> and

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
improve their standard of living and

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.430 
improve their standard of living and
improve<00:02:32.010> their<00:02:32.430> skills<00:02:33.150> at<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.540> same<00:02:33.569> time<00:02:34.019> so

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
improve their skills at the same time so

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.020 
improve their skills at the same time so
I<00:02:34.470> think<00:02:34.620> it<00:02:34.860> of<00:02:34.980> course<00:02:35.220> that<00:02:35.519> oh<00:02:35.640> you<00:02:35.730> offer

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
I think it of course that oh you offer

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.360 
I think it of course that oh you offer
is<00:02:36.330> actually<00:02:36.660> ideal<00:02:37.049> for<00:02:37.260> people<00:02:37.380> who<00:02:37.739> want<00:02:38.280> to

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
is actually ideal for people who want to

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.090 
is actually ideal for people who want to
work<00:02:38.640> and<00:02:38.940> also<00:02:39.390> study<00:02:39.750> at<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:39.930> same<00:02:40.140> time<00:02:40.380> it

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
work and also study at the same time it

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.360 
work and also study at the same time it
gives<00:02:41.430> room<00:02:41.970> for<00:02:42.019> those<00:02:43.019> were<00:02:43.440> still<00:02:44.099> working

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
gives room for those were still working

University<00:04:08.140> I<00:04:08.800> think<00:04:08.920> is<00:04:09.220> a<00:04:09.250> mechanism<00:04:09.580> for

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
University I think is a mechanism for

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.870 
University I think is a mechanism for
liberation<00:04:10.320> families<00:04:11.320> or<00:04:11.650> communities<00:04:11.880> for

different groups because it's through

different groups because it's through
education<00:04:14.940> that<00:04:15.940> we<00:04:16.090> can<00:04:16.269> actually<00:04:16.390> change
