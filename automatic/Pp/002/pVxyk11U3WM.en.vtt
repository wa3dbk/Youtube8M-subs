00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:59.960 

we're<00:02:57.659> gonna<00:02:57.750> put<00:02:57.989> some<00:02:58.519> chain<00:02:59.519> there<00:02:59.819> as<00:02:59.940> a

we're gonna put some chain there as a

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.149 
we're gonna put some chain there as a
safety<00:03:00.330> link<00:03:00.690> we<00:03:01.110> had<00:03:01.230> asked<00:03:01.650> a<00:03:01.739> village<00:03:02.010> about

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:02.159 
safety link we had asked a village about

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:04.430 
safety link we had asked a village about
doing<00:03:02.640> some<00:03:02.819> trail<00:03:03.090> work<00:03:03.299> on<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:03.780> trails<00:03:04.080> that

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
doing some trail work on the trails that

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.229 
doing some trail work on the trails that
the<00:03:04.560> climbers<00:03:05.010> use<00:03:05.220> as<00:03:05.459> well<00:03:05.610> as<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:05.819> locals

the climbers use as well as the locals

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.020 
the climbers use as well as the locals
because<00:03:06.750> the<00:03:06.959> influx<00:03:07.319> of<00:03:07.530> climbers<00:03:08.030> has

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
because the influx of climbers has

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.630 
because the influx of climbers has
impacted<00:03:09.659> the<00:03:09.810> trail<00:03:10.019> system<00:03:10.560> those<00:03:11.250> guys<00:03:11.459> are
