well<00:00:51.309> the<00:00:51.399> first<00:00:51.609> thing<00:00:51.789> you<00:00:51.909> think<00:00:51.940> of<00:00:52.269> as<00:00:52.449> his

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
well the first thing you think of as his

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:55.169 
well the first thing you think of as his
role<00:00:53.019> as<00:00:53.229> the<00:00:53.379> masked<00:00:53.710> rider<00:00:53.889> I<00:00:54.190> guess<00:00:55.059> I

00:00:55.169 --> 00:00:55.179 
role as the masked rider I guess I

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:58.229 
role as the masked rider I guess I
became<00:00:55.829> aware<00:00:56.829> of<00:00:57.100> that<00:00:57.190> in<00:00:57.309> the<00:00:57.370> mid<00:00:57.550> 90s<00:00:57.999> more

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
became aware of that in the mid 90s more

00:00:58.239 --> 00:00:59.579 
became aware of that in the mid 90s more
because<00:00:58.539> that's<00:00:58.719> when<00:00:58.870> I<00:00:58.899> began<00:00:59.170> working<00:00:59.440> with

because that's when I began working with
the<00:00:59.710> program<00:01:00.190> and<00:01:00.429> so<00:01:00.579> that's<00:01:01.269> the<00:01:01.420> first

the program and so that's the first
thing<00:01:01.749> that<00:01:01.899> jumps<00:01:02.170> off<00:01:02.289> the<00:01:02.350> pages<00:01:02.710> you<00:01:03.280> know

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370

he was the first mask writer so he had

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:06.510 
he was the first mask writer so he had
some<00:01:05.170> initiative<00:01:05.740> he<00:01:05.890> had<00:01:06.010> some<00:01:06.190> people<00:01:06.370> that

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
some initiative he had some people that

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.970 
some initiative he had some people that
thought<00:01:07.270> enough<00:01:07.630> of<00:01:07.870> him<00:01:08.170> to<00:01:08.200> put<00:01:08.410> him<00:01:08.710> in<00:01:08.830> that
