to<00:00:10.410> create<00:00:11.370> some<00:00:11.610> highlights<00:00:12.059> in<00:00:12.210> the<00:00:12.300> eye<00:00:12.330> now

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
to create some highlights in the eye now

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.600 
to create some highlights in the eye now
highlights<00:00:13.590> are<00:00:13.860> slightly<00:00:14.099> different<00:00:14.460> from

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
edges and that's our highlight the next

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.820 
edges and that's our highlight the next
thing<00:01:03.449> we<00:01:03.539> have<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.780> do<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.049> create<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.470> shadow

thing we have to do is create a shadow

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.730 
thing we have to do is create a shadow
underneath<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.610> eyelid<00:01:06.350> so<00:01:07.350> for<00:01:07.500> this<00:01:07.619> we're

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
underneath the eyelid so for this we're

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.469 
underneath the eyelid so for this we're
going<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.920> use<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.189> black<00:01:08.430> now<00:01:09.210> be<00:01:09.360> very

going to use the black now be very
careful<00:01:09.600> with<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.170> black<00:01:10.380> but<00:01:10.590> it's<00:01:10.740> just

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
careful with the black but it's just

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.179

soft<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.580> quite<00:01:12.000> strong<00:01:12.150> so<00:01:13.049> be<00:01:13.890> very<00:01:14.070> gentle

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
soft and quite strong so be very gentle

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.399 
soft and quite strong so be very gentle
with<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:14.670> starting<00:01:15.270> from<00:01:15.450> just<00:01:15.960> under<00:01:16.290> the

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
with it starting from just under the

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.929 
with it starting from just under the
eyelid<00:01:17.420> hardly<00:01:18.420> touching<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.840> paper<00:01:19.880> try<00:01:20.880> to

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
eyelid hardly touching the paper try to

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.340 
eyelid hardly touching the paper try to
carefully<00:01:22.400> create<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.729> curve<00:01:24.630> around<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.110> top

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
carefully create a curve around the top

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.999 
carefully create a curve around the top
of<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.560> eye<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:26.450> gently<00:01:27.450> bring<00:01:27.659> it<00:01:27.689> down<00:01:28.049> to

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
of the eye and gently bring it down to

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:29.899 
of the eye and gently bring it down to
create<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.310> shadow

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
create a shadow

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.550 
create a shadow
the<00:01:30.150> unusual<00:01:30.600> thing<00:01:30.630> there<00:01:30.990> little<00:01:31.170> finger<00:01:31.500> is

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
the unusual thing there little finger is

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.719 
the unusual thing there little finger is
probably<00:01:31.829> good<00:01:32.009> for<00:01:32.040> this<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:33.920> softly<00:01:34.920> drag

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
probably good for this and softly drag

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.469 
probably good for this and softly drag
it<00:01:35.880> down<00:01:36.060> over<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.450> green<00:01:36.689> so<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.710> we<00:01:37.860> have<00:01:38.070> a

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
it down over the green so that we have a

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.719 
it down over the green so that we have a
shadow<00:01:39.479> underneath<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:40.020> eyelid<00:01:40.560> same<00:01:41.460> on<00:01:41.640> the

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
shadow underneath the eyelid same on the

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.060 
shadow underneath the eyelid same on the
other<00:01:41.759> eye<00:01:43.909> carefully<00:01:45.200> trace<00:01:46.200> around<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.890> top

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
other eye carefully trace around the top

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.260 
other eye carefully trace around the top
part<00:01:48.680> for<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.770> eye<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:50.220> gradually<00:01:50.939> bring<00:01:51.180> a

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
part for the eye and gradually bring a

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.440 
part for the eye and gradually bring a
little<00:01:51.390> soft<00:01:51.689> shadow<00:01:51.899> down<00:01:52.229> underneath

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
little soft shadow down underneath

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.760 
little soft shadow down underneath
though<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.509> don't<00:01:54.840> have<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.229> worry<00:01:55.409> too<00:01:55.740> much

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
though you don't have to worry too much

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.100 
though you don't have to worry too much
if<00:01:56.130> you've<00:01:56.340> if<00:01:57.060> your<00:01:57.270> black<00:01:57.540> has<00:01:57.719> escaped

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
if you've if your black has escaped

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.260 
if you've if your black has escaped
outside<00:01:58.439> of<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.130> outline<00:01:59.520> because<00:01:59.759> we<00:02:00.090> can

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
outside of the outline because we can

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.660 
outside of the outline because we can
cover<00:02:00.630> that<00:02:00.719> later<00:02:01.049> with<00:02:01.649> our<00:02:01.680> highlights<00:02:02.250> and

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
cover that later with our highlights and

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.149 
cover that later with our highlights and
then<00:02:02.880> what<00:02:03.090> we'll<00:02:03.240> do<00:02:03.479> is<00:02:03.719> just<00:02:04.049> sketch<00:02:04.530> in<00:02:04.710> the

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
then what we'll do is just sketch in the

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.800 
then what we'll do is just sketch in the
pupil<00:02:05.780> using<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.869> side<00:02:07.079> of<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.320> pastel<00:02:08.810> it's

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
pupil using the side of the pastel it's

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.960 
pupil using the side of the pastel it's
almost<00:02:10.259> a<00:02:10.410> diamond<00:02:10.860> shape<00:02:11.129> because<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.700> cat's

do<00:02:12.120> have<00:02:12.300> slippers<00:02:12.569> of<00:02:13.080> course

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
do have slippers of course

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.960 
do have slippers of course
but<00:02:14.650> rather<00:02:14.920> than<00:02:15.189> just<00:02:15.340> create<00:02:15.580> a<00:02:15.640> straight

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
but rather than just create a straight

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.039 
but rather than just create a straight
line<00:02:16.209> we're<00:02:16.450> trying<00:02:16.689> to<00:02:16.750> create<00:02:16.840> a<00:02:16.959> little

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:17.049 
line we're trying to create a little

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:18.960 
line we're trying to create a little
diamond<00:02:17.590> shape<00:02:17.620> soften<00:02:18.519> it<00:02:18.610> off<00:02:18.730> with<00:02:18.879> the

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
diamond shape soften it off with the

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.170 
diamond shape soften it off with the
fingers<00:02:19.269> again<00:02:19.860> so<00:02:20.860> it's<00:02:21.010> not<00:02:21.129> too<00:02:21.340> harsh<00:02:21.579> so

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.729 

now<00:02:25.180> we<00:02:25.239> can<00:02:25.450> put<00:02:25.569> a<00:02:25.629> reflection<00:02:26.140> in<00:02:26.260> for<00:02:26.680> the

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
now we can put a reflection in for the

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:28.530 
now we can put a reflection in for the
reflection<00:02:27.310> I'm<00:02:27.760> just<00:02:27.970> going<00:02:28.120> to<00:02:28.180> use<00:02:28.329> the

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
reflection I'm just going to use the

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.050 
reflection I'm just going to use the
white<00:02:28.780> soft<00:02:29.140> pastel<00:02:29.650> we've<00:02:30.579> got<00:02:30.700> to<00:02:30.790> bear<00:02:31.030> in

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
white soft pastel we've got to bear in

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.390 
white soft pastel we've got to bear in
mind<00:02:31.239> that<00:02:31.599> the<00:02:31.750> eye<00:02:31.810> is<00:02:31.959> curved<00:02:32.470> outwards<00:02:33.159> as

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
mind that the eye is curved outwards as

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.250 
mind that the eye is curved outwards as
well<00:02:33.549> as<00:02:33.640> around<00:02:33.940> so<00:02:34.329> the<00:02:34.450> reflection<00:02:34.840> needs

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
well as around so the reflection needs

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.979 
well as around so the reflection needs
to<00:02:35.500> represent<00:02:36.310> that<00:02:36.489> so<00:02:37.000> we'll<00:02:37.209> start<00:02:37.420> off<00:02:37.569> on

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
to represent that so we'll start off on

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:39.539 
to represent that so we'll start off on
the<00:02:38.079> left<00:02:38.290> hand<00:02:38.500> side<00:02:38.739> of<00:02:38.920> the<00:02:39.010> lights<00:02:39.220> coming

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
the left hand side of the lights coming

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:41.369 
the left hand side of the lights coming
from<00:02:39.670> the<00:02:39.790> top<00:02:40.000> left<00:02:40.209> for<00:02:40.780> example<00:02:40.840> we'll

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:41.379 
from the top left for example we'll

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:43.740 
from the top left for example we'll
start<00:02:41.440> off<00:02:41.680> with<00:02:41.799> a<00:02:41.829> little<00:02:42.269> patch<00:02:43.269> of<00:02:43.450> light

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
start off with a little patch of light

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.710 
start off with a little patch of light
could<00:02:44.379> be<00:02:44.439> the<00:02:44.650> Sun<00:02:45.120> just<00:02:46.120> on<00:02:46.239> the<00:02:46.329> left-hand

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
could be the Sun just on the left-hand

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.990 
could be the Sun just on the left-hand
side<00:02:46.989> and<00:02:47.349> then<00:02:47.769> use<00:02:48.040> the<00:02:48.220> edge<00:02:48.370> of<00:02:48.549> the<00:02:48.609> pasta

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
side and then use the edge of the pasta

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.780 
side and then use the edge of the pasta
below<00:02:49.810> the<00:02:50.019> shadow<00:02:50.230> just<00:02:51.129> to<00:02:51.190> create<00:02:51.430> a<00:02:51.519> little

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
below the shadow just to create a little

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.500 
below the shadow just to create a little
curved<00:02:52.180> reflection<00:02:53.079> over<00:02:53.829> there<00:02:54.250> and<00:02:54.519> gently

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
curved reflection over there and gently

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.180 
curved reflection over there and gently
tap<00:02:55.750> it<00:02:55.810> in<00:02:55.989> with<00:02:56.019> the<00:02:56.170> finger<00:02:56.530> we<00:02:56.859> don't<00:02:57.040> want

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
tap it in with the finger we don't want

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.970 
tap it in with the finger we don't want
to<00:02:57.340> smudge<00:02:57.819> it<00:02:57.849> away<00:02:58.239> too<00:02:58.299> much<00:02:58.750> and<00:02:59.680> we<00:02:59.739> do<00:02:59.859> the

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
to smudge it away too much and we do the

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.550 
to smudge it away too much and we do the
same<00:03:00.129> on<00:03:00.310> the<00:03:00.430> other<00:03:00.609> eye<00:03:01.030> so<00:03:01.329> a<00:03:01.420> little<00:03:01.750> dab<00:03:02.530> of

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
same on the other eye so a little dab of

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.039 
same on the other eye so a little dab of
light<00:03:02.980> there<00:03:03.430> and<00:03:03.909> a<00:03:04.000> little<00:03:04.120> curved<00:03:04.599> tail

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
light there and a little curved tail

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:09.000 
light there and a little curved tail
almost<00:03:06.000> curving<00:03:07.000> across<00:03:07.540> the<00:03:07.720> pupil<00:03:08.079> now<00:03:08.560> what

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
almost curving across the pupil now what

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.470 
almost curving across the pupil now what
we<00:03:09.069> can<00:03:09.220> do<00:03:09.310> is<00:03:09.459> go<00:03:09.609> back<00:03:09.639> with<00:03:10.030> the<00:03:10.090> black<00:03:10.299> and

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
we can do is go back with the black and

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.300 
we can do is go back with the black and
just<00:03:10.870> sharpen<00:03:11.290> up<00:03:11.379> those<00:03:11.560> edges<00:03:11.920> a<00:03:11.950> wee<00:03:12.129> bit

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
just sharpen up those edges a wee bit

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.750 
just sharpen up those edges a wee bit
more<00:03:12.370> so<00:03:13.359> using<00:03:14.200> edge<00:03:14.470> of<00:03:14.950> the<00:03:15.069> black<00:03:15.250> pastel

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
more so using edge of the black pastel

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.390 
more so using edge of the black pastel
try<00:03:16.329> to<00:03:16.389> create<00:03:16.840> a<00:03:17.200> reasonably<00:03:17.859> sharp<00:03:18.129> edge

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
try to create a reasonably sharp edge

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.430 
try to create a reasonably sharp edge
around<00:03:19.120> the<00:03:20.019> green<00:03:20.319> iris<00:03:21.250> of<00:03:21.400> the<00:03:21.430> eye<00:03:22.440> but

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
around the green iris of the eye but

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.819 
around the green iris of the eye but
again<00:03:23.859> we<00:03:24.040> don't<00:03:24.190> have<00:03:24.400> to<00:03:24.549> fret<00:03:24.849> if<00:03:25.209> that<00:03:25.829> line

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829 
again we don't have to fret if that line

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:28.800 
again we don't have to fret if that line
isn't<00:03:27.099> perfect<00:03:27.699> because<00:03:27.940> we<00:03:28.120> can<00:03:28.239> correct<00:03:28.569> it

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
isn't perfect because we can correct it

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.669 
isn't perfect because we can correct it
with<00:03:29.079> our<00:03:29.199> highlights<00:03:29.650> at<00:03:30.340> the<00:03:30.519> end
