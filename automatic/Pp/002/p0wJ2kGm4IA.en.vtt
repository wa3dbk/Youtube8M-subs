00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.830
 my name is marc anthony beltoise 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:34.860
 who these days to train in 

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:36.120
 ju-jitsu carbon is someone of humble 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.710
 that treats everyone the same 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.500
 way and that any choice belt 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.260
 white or black belts even 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.850
 the people from the outside the friends the 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.110
 athletes of the great masters 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:52.830
 he treats everyone the same 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:54.510
 way for me barbosa has very 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:58.610
 quickly but it's like my father because 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.780
 he helped me it's a small good effort 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:04.110
 but he does not need that for 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.000
 others respect him he gets to himself 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.430
 to enforce simply by being this 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.680
 that he is with his heart of relationships 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.659
 that I think that's what counts 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.080
 to be an important person and a 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.080
 good teacher 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.479
 we know it's a Japanese habit 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.920
 all the other crops it is 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.110
 Russian or American and in any 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.229
 which discipline have their own way 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.450
 to stimulate in front of the performance of 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.979
 the athlete his face on cardio when you 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.210
 see how much training he 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.869
 was hypocrisy 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.610
 they make products but he trains 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.659
 can not stay back to the wall 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.430
 and if kind of way kids 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.880
 correct it must not appear in the 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.979
 doping controls 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.430
 for me it is a great master who has 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.380
 went through a lot of hardships for me 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.780
 is like a mirror 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.630
 it's someone important I hope 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:11.369
 arrive one day almost at his level of 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.369
 do everything for the sport 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.970
 what is nice in ju jitsu is 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.660
 that the rules allow ju-jitsu 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.250
 to be creative you have to adapt to the 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.660
 rule and the rule must adapt to 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.780
 new techniques in the process of 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.780
 develop 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:30.209
 that's why it's a perpetual 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.209
 change 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.760
 my son loves ju jitsu but if you 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:40.620
 do not want to do ju jitsu but 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:43.620
 Dance is what you would do 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.230
 you would let there be that would 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.560
 complicated and anyway it's not 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.560
 his style 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.050
 sometimes I had to be still 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.910
 stronger without it I was going to be lost 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.180
 I was going to die that was a sensation 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.180
 of death 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.740
 it would be a privilege to die with a 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.670
 kimono as late as possible to a minimum 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.670
 at 90
