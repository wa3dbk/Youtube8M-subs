just get on it and ride and really

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.529 
just get on it and ride and really
user-friendly<00:01:24.679> it's<00:01:25.679> fast<00:01:26.490> but<00:01:26.880> it's<00:01:27.030> not<00:01:27.210> too

00:01:27.529 --> 00:01:27.539 
user-friendly it's fast but it's not too

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:33.410 
user-friendly it's fast but it's not too
fast<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:30.799> like<00:01:31.799> that<00:01:32.369> once<00:01:32.819> you<00:01:32.939> did<00:01:33.090> kind<00:01:33.359> of

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
fast I like that once you did kind of

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.029 
fast I like that once you did kind of
figure<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:33.689> out<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:33.959> get<00:01:34.079> going<00:01:34.109> you<00:01:34.740> really

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:35.039 
figure it out and get going you really

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:37.219 
figure it out and get going you really
can<00:01:35.369> override<00:01:36.030> it<00:01:36.060> like<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.450> lot<00:01:36.689> of<00:01:36.869> what<00:01:37.200> I

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
can override it like a lot of what I

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.139 
can override it like a lot of what I
thought<00:01:37.530> would<00:01:37.799> be<00:01:37.859> the<00:01:38.189> case<00:01:38.369> with<00:01:38.640> an<00:01:38.789> entry

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:39.149 
thought would be the case with an entry

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:42.109 
thought would be the case with an entry
level<00:01:39.509> type<00:01:39.899> quad<00:01:40.319> and<00:01:40.679> you<00:01:40.920> can<00:01:41.609> kind<00:01:41.849> of<00:01:41.939> just

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
level type quad and you can kind of just

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.149 
level type quad and you can kind of just
keep<00:01:42.329> going<00:01:42.630> faster<00:01:43.109> and<00:01:43.140> faster<00:01:43.319> on<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:43.950> so

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
keep going faster and faster on it so

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.770 
keep going faster and faster on it so
it's<00:01:44.310> pretty<00:01:44.459> good<00:01:44.700> it's<00:01:45.359> going<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.569> figure

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
it's pretty good it's going to figure

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:54.710 
it's pretty good it's going to figure
out<00:01:45.959> how<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.079> do<00:01:46.289> it<00:01:46.349> a<00:01:46.439> little<00:01:46.560> better

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720
