00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
we're going to stir it each time until

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.500 
we're going to stir it each time until
everything<00:00:41.010> is<00:00:41.070> completely<00:00:41.610> melted<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.239> well

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
smooth and don't let it cool down for

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.420 
smooth and don't let it cool down for
about<00:00:50.969> 15<00:00:51.480> minutes<00:00:51.750> so<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.500> that<00:00:52.770> I'm<00:00:53.129> going<00:00:53.309> to

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
about 15 minutes so to that I'm going to

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.369 
about 15 minutes so to that I'm going to
add<00:00:53.550> in<00:00:53.699> about<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.300> tablespoon<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:55.230> vanilla

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.619 
extract and then 2 beaten eggs and now
we're<00:00:59.730> just<00:00:59.789> going<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.030> mix<00:01:00.149> this<00:01:00.239> through<00:01:00.510> on

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
we're just going to mix this through on

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.179 
we're just going to mix this through on
a<00:01:00.719> low<00:01:00.870> just<00:01:01.170> until<00:01:01.440> it's<00:01:01.530> well<00:01:01.620> combined<00:01:02.010> now

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:04.189 
a low just until it's well combined now

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:06.560 
a low just until it's well combined now
for<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.250> final<00:01:05.430> ingredient<00:01:05.640> I<00:01:06.090> have<00:01:06.270> just

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
for the final ingredient I have just

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.630 
for the final ingredient I have just
over<00:01:06.750> one<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.320> half<00:01:07.470> cups<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.950> self-raising

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
over one and a half cups of self-raising

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.899 
over one and a half cups of self-raising
flour<00:01:08.700> which<00:01:09.689> works<00:01:09.900> out<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.140> 250<00:01:10.979> grams<00:01:11.250> if

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
flour which works out to 250 grams if

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.460 
flour which works out to 250 grams if
you<00:01:12.060> don't<00:01:12.210> have<00:01:12.330> self<00:01:12.570> raising<00:01:12.720> flour<00:01:12.930> you

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
you don't have self raising flour you

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.170 
you don't have self raising flour you
can<00:01:13.500> use<00:01:13.619> regular<00:01:14.250> plain<00:01:14.520> flour<00:01:14.790> with<00:01:15.150> a

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
can use regular plain flour with a

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.090 
can use regular plain flour with a
tablespoon<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:15.840> baking<00:01:16.110> powder<00:01:16.409> so<00:01:16.890> I'm<00:01:16.950> just

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
tablespoon of baking powder so I'm just

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.100 
tablespoon of baking powder so I'm just
going<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.369> add<00:01:17.549> in<00:01:17.729> about<00:01:18.000> water<00:01:18.540> at<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.840> time

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
going to add in about water at a time

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.530 
going to add in about water at a time
and<00:01:19.759> then<00:01:20.759> we're<00:01:20.909> going<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.090> mix<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:21.390> through

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
and then we're going to mix that through

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.539 
and then we're going to mix that through
and<00:01:22.290> once<00:01:22.439> it's<00:01:22.619> completely<00:01:22.979> combined<00:01:23.400> I'm

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
and once it's completely combined I'm

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.130 
and once it's completely combined I'm
going<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.850> add<00:01:23.970> another<00:01:24.090> quarter<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:24.930> so

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
going to add another quarter and so

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.020 
going to add another quarter and so
forth<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:26.070> reason<00:01:26.369> we<00:01:26.460> do<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:26.640> is<00:01:26.790> it

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
forth and the reason we do that is it

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.700 
forth and the reason we do that is it
just<00:01:27.210> simply<00:01:27.360> helps<00:01:27.750> prevent<00:01:28.110> any<00:01:28.320> lumps

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
just simply helps prevent any lumps

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.030 
just simply helps prevent any lumps
performing<00:01:30.290> ok<00:01:31.290> so<00:01:31.350> finally<00:01:31.710> I<00:01:31.860> have<00:01:32.009> a

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
performing ok so finally I have a

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.510 
performing ok so finally I have a
springform<00:01:32.790> pan<00:01:33.119> that<00:01:33.450> just<00:01:33.689> grazed<00:01:34.049> in<00:01:34.259> lined

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
springform pan that just grazed in lined

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.670 
springform pan that just grazed in lined
