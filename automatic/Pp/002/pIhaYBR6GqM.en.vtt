00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
and spectral in the beta and while I did

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.589 
and spectral in the beta and while I did
figure<00:00:11.219> it<00:00:11.400> out<00:00:11.580> earlier<00:00:11.940> because<00:00:12.150> some<00:00:12.450> other

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
figure it out earlier because some other

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.330 
figure it out earlier because some other
people<00:00:12.870> helped<00:00:13.019> me<00:00:13.139> out<00:00:13.170> and<00:00:13.380> told<00:00:13.530> me<00:00:13.799> I<00:00:13.980> know

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
people helped me out and told me I know

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.799 
people helped me out and told me I know
that<00:00:14.580> a<00:00:14.610> lot<00:00:14.790> of<00:00:14.849> people<00:00:14.940> don't<00:00:15.389> know<00:00:15.599> what's

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
that a lot of people don't know what's

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.529 
that a lot of people don't know what's
going<00:00:16.080> on<00:00:16.199> with<00:00:16.350> those<00:00:16.500> right<00:00:16.770> now<00:00:17.240> so<00:00:18.240> I

going on with those right now so I
figured<00:00:19.289> I<00:00:19.350> might<00:00:19.529> as<00:00:19.590> well<00:00:19.740> make<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.310> video<00:00:20.820> to

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
figured I might as well make a video to

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.790 
figured I might as well make a video to
tell<00:00:21.180> you<00:00:21.330> guys<00:00:21.420> about<00:00:21.600> that<00:00:21.930> because<00:00:22.500> there

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
is a lot of confusion on it so yeah it's

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.490 
is a lot of confusion on it so yeah it's
confirmed<00:00:26.310> here<00:00:26.939> in<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.660> forums<00:00:28.140> I<00:00:28.289> just

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
confirmed here in the forums I just

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.660 
confirmed here in the forums I just
reading<00:00:28.769> through<00:00:28.920> these<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.369> I<00:00:29.400> thought<00:00:29.550> it

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
reading through these and I thought it

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.009 
reading through these and I thought it
might<00:00:29.699> as<00:00:29.880> well<00:00:30.029> you<00:00:30.150> guys<00:00:30.300> know<00:00:30.359> so<00:00:30.720> it<00:00:30.810> says

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
might as well you guys know so it says

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.200 
might as well you guys know so it says
why<00:00:31.619> are<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.890> elysian<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:32.520> divine<00:00:32.880> classed

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
why are the elysian and divine classed

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.630 
why are the elysian and divine classed
into<00:00:33.510> tears<00:00:33.780> now<00:00:34.110> when<00:00:34.860> they<00:00:35.040> are<00:00:35.219> shields

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
into tears now when they are shields

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.310 
into tears now when they are shields
that<00:00:35.730> all<00:00:35.850> types<00:00:36.090> of<00:00:36.270> people<00:00:36.570> could<00:00:36.930> use<00:00:37.140> with

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
that all types of people could use with

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.470 
that all types of people could use with
in<00:00:37.469> combat<00:00:37.890> so<00:00:38.399> basically<00:00:38.879> if<00:00:38.969> you<00:00:39.059> don't<00:00:39.300> know

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
in combat so basically if you don't know

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.690 
in combat so basically if you don't know
when<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:39.840> hover<00:00:40.050> over<00:00:40.200> an<00:00:40.649> elysian<00:00:41.100> divine<00:00:41.460> or

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
when you hover over an elysian divine or

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.690 
when you hover over an elysian divine or
arcane<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.480> will<00:00:42.629> now<00:00:42.809> say<00:00:43.110> class<00:00:43.739> melee<00:00:44.460> for

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
arcane it will now say class melee for

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.180 
arcane it will now say class melee for
divine<00:00:44.969> class<00:00:45.840> range<00:00:46.260> for<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.620> lesion<00:00:46.860> and

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
divine class range for a lesion and

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.490 
divine class range for a lesion and
classmate<00:00:47.969> for<00:00:48.239> our<00:00:48.390> Akane<00:00:48.750> so<00:00:49.350> they're

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
classmate for our Akane so they're

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.080 
classmate for our Akane so they're
basically<00:00:49.620> being<00:00:50.430> split<00:00:50.760> into<00:00:50.940> different

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
basically being split into different

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.560 
basically being split into different
classes<00:00:51.570> of<00:00:51.899> combat<00:00:53.000> and<00:00:54.000> people<00:00:54.480> were

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
classes of combat and people were

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.479 
classes of combat and people were
wondering<00:00:54.780> why<00:00:55.079> that<00:00:55.110> was<00:00:55.440> so<00:00:55.920> basically

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
wondering why that was so basically

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.150 
wondering why that was so basically
what's<00:00:56.670> happening<00:00:56.760> is<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:58.079> instead<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:59.010> the

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
what's happening is that instead of the

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.770 
what's happening is that instead of the
elysian<00:00:59.609> having<00:00:59.910> its<00:01:00.059> own<00:01:00.210> effect<00:01:00.570> and

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
elysian having its own effect and

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.240 
elysian having its own effect and
instead<00:01:01.020> of<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.140> arcane<00:01:01.530> having<00:01:01.890> no<00:01:02.100> effect

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
instead of the arcane having no effect

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.310 
instead of the arcane having no effect
except<00:01:02.879> magic<00:01:03.180> bonus<00:01:03.510> they're<00:01:03.989> basically

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
except magic bonus they're basically

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.469 
except magic bonus they're basically
making<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.830> Elysian<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.460> arcane<00:01:05.850> equals

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
making the Elysian and the arcane equals

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.560 
making the Elysian and the arcane equals
the<00:01:06.689> divine<00:01:07.080> in<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.409> sense<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:08.570> absorbs

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
the divine in the sense that it absorbs

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.359 
the divine in the sense that it absorbs
thirty<00:01:09.869> percent<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:10.380> all<00:01:10.470> damage<00:01:10.890> at<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.130> cost

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
thirty percent of all damage at the cost

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.560 
thirty percent of all damage at the cost
of<00:01:11.640> prayer<00:01:11.939> points<00:01:12.830> so<00:01:14.000> now<00:01:15.000> basically<00:01:15.240> the

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
of prayer points so now basically the

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.420 
of prayer points so now basically the
arcane<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.049> elysian<00:01:16.290> are<00:01:16.619> as<00:01:17.130> good<00:01:17.250> as<00:01:17.340> a

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
arcane and elysian are as good as a

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.920 
arcane and elysian are as good as a
divine<00:01:17.759> except<00:01:18.150> arcane<00:01:18.450> is<00:01:18.570> for<00:01:18.750> mage

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
divine except arcane is for mage

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.140 
divine except arcane is for mage
allegiance<00:01:19.799> for<00:01:19.979> range<00:01:20.189> divine<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:20.759> from<00:01:20.939> a

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
allegiance for range divine is from a

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.760 
allegiance for range divine is from a
layers<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:23.090> the<00:01:24.110> abilities<00:01:25.110> of<00:01:25.170> those<00:01:25.500> so

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
layers and the abilities of those so

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.950 
layers and the abilities of those so
thirty<00:01:26.159> percent<00:01:26.460> soaking<00:01:26.939> is<00:01:27.090> not<00:01:27.479> currently

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
thirty percent soaking is not currently

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.440 
thirty percent soaking is not currently
working<00:01:28.290> in<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.829> beta<00:01:29.070> so<00:01:29.970> for<00:01:30.210> all<00:01:30.329> the

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
working in the beta so for all the

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.120 
working in the beta so for all the
people<00:01:30.630> who<00:01:30.990> matter<00:01:31.259> might<00:01:31.680> have<00:01:31.799> used<00:01:31.979> it<00:01:32.070> in

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
people who matter might have used it in

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.350 
people who matter might have used it in
the<00:01:32.220> beta<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.549> realize<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:32.939> didn't<00:01:33.210> make<00:01:33.329> a

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
the beta and realize it didn't make a

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.880 
the beta and realize it didn't make a
difference<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:33.990> because<00:01:34.200> that's<00:01:34.560> because

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
difference that because that's because

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.310 
difference that because that's because
it<00:01:35.009> really<00:01:35.159> doesn't<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:36.210> doesn't<00:01:36.720> soak

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
it really doesn't it doesn't soak

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.200 
it really doesn't it doesn't soak
correctly<00:01:37.950> in<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.100> beta<00:01:38.340> so<00:01:38.670> if<00:01:38.909> you're<00:01:39.060> using

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
correctly in the beta so if you're using

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.789 
correctly in the beta so if you're using
in<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.479> beta<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.869> panicking<00:01:40.290> because<00:01:40.470> you

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
in the beta and panicking because you

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.319 
in the beta and panicking because you
thought<00:01:41.040> that<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.400> will<00:01:41.520> lose<00:01:41.700> its<00:01:41.729> abilities

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
thought that it will lose its abilities

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.510 
thought that it will lose its abilities
it<00:01:42.509> doesn't<00:01:42.899> that's<00:01:43.020> just<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.380> glitch<00:01:43.590> so<00:01:44.369> just

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
it doesn't that's just a glitch so just

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.069 
it doesn't that's just a glitch so just
make<00:01:44.670> sure<00:01:44.820> you<00:01:44.939> know<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.479> it<00:01:45.810> should<00:01:45.990> be

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
make sure you know that and it should be

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.270 
make sure you know that and it should be
fixed<00:01:46.320> soon<00:01:47.090> so<00:01:48.090> yeah<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:49.079> will<00:01:49.439> still<00:01:49.799> absorb

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
fixed soon so yeah it will still absorb

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.249 
fixed soon so yeah it will still absorb
damage<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.939> then<00:01:51.180> they're<00:01:51.360> in<00:01:51.509> class<00:01:51.810> because

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
damage and then they're in class because

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.230 
damage and then they're in class because
each<00:01:52.439> class<00:01:52.740> now<00:01:53.159> has<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.399> shield<00:01:53.759> that<00:01:53.909> carries

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
each class now has a shield that carries

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.209 
each class now has a shield that carries
the<00:01:54.390> divine<00:01:54.659> ability<00:01:55.110> so<00:01:55.590> basically<00:01:56.009> what

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
the divine ability so basically what

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.539 
the divine ability so basically what
they're<00:01:56.369> doing<00:01:56.579> was<00:01:56.759> making<00:01:56.939> it<00:01:57.780> so<00:01:57.960> that<00:01:57.990> each

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
they're doing was making it so that each

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:01.520 
they're doing was making it so that each
part<00:01:59.549> of<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.729> combat<00:02:00.119> triangles<00:02:00.479> is<00:02:00.630> equal

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
part of the combat triangles is equal

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.990 
part of the combat triangles is equal
because<00:02:01.710> essentially<00:02:02.159> all<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.520> them<00:02:02.759> have

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
because essentially all of them have

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.840 
because essentially all of them have
their<00:02:03.240> Divine's<00:02:03.630> instead<00:02:04.590> of<00:02:04.770> you<00:02:05.700> know<00:02:05.729> a

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
their Divine's instead of you know a

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.940 
their Divine's instead of you know a
universal<00:02:06.750> divine<00:02:07.049> i'm<00:02:07.229> not<00:02:07.409> sure<00:02:07.590> why<00:02:07.770> they

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
universal divine i'm not sure why they

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.619 
universal divine i'm not sure why they
couldn't<00:02:08.190> just<00:02:08.310> have<00:02:08.459> a<00:02:08.640> universal<00:02:09.300> divine

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
couldn't just have a universal divine

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.229 
couldn't just have a universal divine
but<00:02:09.899> i<00:02:10.170> don't<00:02:11.069> know<00:02:11.099> how<00:02:11.160> you<00:02:11.400> i<00:02:11.550> guess<00:02:11.910> they

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
but i don't know how you i guess they

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.080 
but i don't know how you i guess they
know<00:02:12.480> whether

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
know whether

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.320 
know whether
more<00:02:13.360> than<00:02:13.450> I<00:02:13.569> do<00:02:13.629> and<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:15.580> special<00:02:16.000> does<00:02:16.180> not

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
more than I do and the special does not

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:17.790 
more than I do and the special does not
carry<00:02:16.599> an<00:02:16.720> ability<00:02:16.930> but<00:02:17.230> has<00:02:17.379> the<00:02:17.530> same

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
carry an ability but has the same

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.559 
carry an ability but has the same
defensive<00:02:18.340> stats<00:02:18.640> and<00:02:18.910> it's<00:02:19.030> placed<00:02:19.330> in<00:02:19.510> the

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
defensive stats and it's placed in the

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.660 
defensive stats and it's placed in the
same<00:02:19.810> tier<00:02:20.170> as<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:20.530> band<00:02:20.769> of<00:02:20.920> sand<00:02:21.220> armadale

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
same tier as the band of sand armadale

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.509 
same tier as the band of sand armadale
shield<00:02:22.290> now<00:02:23.290> this<00:02:23.410> is<00:02:23.470> interesting<00:02:23.590> because

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 
shield now this is interesting because

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:26.580 
shield now this is interesting because
while<00:02:24.910> I<00:02:24.940> don't<00:02:25.300> have<00:02:25.569> footage<00:02:26.019> from<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.379> beta

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
while I don't have footage from the beta

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.509 
while I don't have footage from the beta
right<00:02:26.890> now<00:02:27.129> I<00:02:27.959> did<00:02:28.959> look<00:02:29.560> at<00:02:29.739> the<00:02:30.069> spectral

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
right now I did look at the spectral

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:32.309 
right now I did look at the spectral
when<00:02:30.670> I<00:02:30.700> could<00:02:31.000> when<00:02:31.239> on<00:02:31.599> during<00:02:31.840> the<00:02:31.959> weekend

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
when I could when on during the weekend

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:33.930 
when I could when on during the weekend
because<00:02:32.830> over<00:02:33.099> the<00:02:33.190> weekend<00:02:33.489> i<00:02:33.580> did<00:02:33.790> have

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
because over the weekend i did have

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.460 
because over the weekend i did have
access<00:02:34.299> to<00:02:34.390> the<00:02:34.480> beta<00:02:34.660> views<00:02:34.959> all<00:02:35.140> members

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
access to the beta views all members

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:36.780 
access to the beta views all members
have<00:02:35.500> X<00:02:35.860> this<00:02:35.980> is<00:02:36.129> the<00:02:36.220> beta<00:02:36.400> over<00:02:36.670> the

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
have X this is the beta over the

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.600 
have X this is the beta over the
weekends<00:02:37.269> so<00:02:38.080> I<00:02:38.470> was<00:02:38.769> able<00:02:38.950> to<00:02:39.099> look<00:02:39.310> at<00:02:39.459> my

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
weekends so I was able to look at my

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.610 
weekends so I was able to look at my
lucky<00:02:39.970> spectral<00:02:40.510> and<00:02:40.720> I<00:02:41.019> was<00:02:41.140> in<00:02:41.260> a<00:02:41.410> unique

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
lucky spectral and I was in a unique

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.289 
lucky spectral and I was in a unique
position<00:02:41.799> because<00:02:42.250> most<00:02:42.610> people<00:02:42.910> can't<00:02:43.150> see

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
position because most people can't see

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:45.330 
position because most people can't see
the<00:02:43.420> spectral<00:02:43.840> because<00:02:44.140> it's<00:02:44.590> not<00:02:44.830> on<00:02:45.069> offer

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
the spectral because it's not on offer

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.930 
the spectral because it's not on offer

i<00:02:51.099> don't<00:02:51.190> know<00:02:51.310> what<00:02:51.430> to<00:02:51.489> call<00:02:51.519> them<00:02:51.790> but

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
i don't know what to call them but

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.759 
i don't know what to call them but
they're<00:02:52.329> not<00:02:52.450> available<00:02:52.599> there<00:02:53.049> so<00:02:53.349> i<00:02:53.380> was<00:02:53.650> in

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
they're not available there so i was in

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:54.960 
they're not available there so i was in
a<00:02:53.829> little<00:02:54.069> interesting<00:02:54.400> position<00:02:54.760> most

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
a little interesting position most

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.850 
a little interesting position most
people<00:02:55.269> hadn't<00:02:55.569> seen<00:02:55.720> the<00:02:55.840> spectral<00:02:56.260> but<00:02:56.829> i

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
people hadn't seen the spectral but i

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.229 
people hadn't seen the spectral but i
can<00:02:57.040> tell<00:02:57.190> you<00:02:57.220> now<00:02:57.459> that<00:02:57.489> it's<00:02:57.819> kind<00:02:57.970> of<00:02:58.060> odd

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
can tell you now that it's kind of odd

00:02:58.239 --> 00:02:59.789 
can tell you now that it's kind of odd
because<00:02:58.480> the<00:02:58.629> spectral<00:02:59.170> does<00:02:59.410> not<00:02:59.590> have<00:02:59.769> a

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
because the spectral does not have a

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:01.740 
because the spectral does not have a
class<00:03:00.160> i<00:03:00.459> don't<00:03:00.970> know<00:03:01.120> if<00:03:01.209> that<00:03:01.360> means<00:03:01.510> it's

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
class i don't know if that means it's

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.630 
class i don't know if that means it's
universal<00:03:02.379> or<00:03:02.590> if<00:03:02.739> it's<00:03:02.890> that's<00:03:03.250> just<00:03:03.519> a

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
universal or if it's that's just a

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.880 
universal or if it's that's just a
glitch<00:03:03.910> or<00:03:04.000> something<00:03:04.060> and<00:03:04.629> that<00:03:05.410> they

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
glitch or something and that they

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.430 
glitch or something and that they
weren't<00:03:06.310> able<00:03:06.610> to<00:03:07.120> or<00:03:07.540> they<00:03:08.110> just<00:03:08.140> made<00:03:08.410> a

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
weren't able to or they just made a

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.380 
weren't able to or they just made a
mistake<00:03:08.829> or<00:03:09.129> they<00:03:09.310> forgot<00:03:09.700> about<00:03:09.940> it<00:03:10.000> i<00:03:10.209> don't

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
mistake or they forgot about it i don't

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:11.970 
mistake or they forgot about it i don't
know<00:03:10.540> but<00:03:10.989> the<00:03:11.170> spectral<00:03:11.530> doesn't<00:03:11.860> have<00:03:11.950> a

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
know but the spectral doesn't have a

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.289 
know but the spectral doesn't have a
class<00:03:12.310> which<00:03:12.549> makes<00:03:12.760> me<00:03:12.879> think<00:03:12.910> that<00:03:13.120> it's

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
class which makes me think that it's

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:16.410 
class which makes me think that it's
universal<00:03:13.989> it<00:03:14.230> has<00:03:14.739> the<00:03:14.980> same<00:03:15.420> defensive

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
universal it has the same defensive

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.509 
universal it has the same defensive
abilities<00:03:16.989> and<00:03:17.230> our<00:03:17.350> little<00:03:17.560> defensive<00:03:18.130> stats

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
abilities and our little defensive stats

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:21.240 
abilities and our little defensive stats
as<00:03:18.819> the<00:03:19.630> divine<00:03:20.049> allegiant<00:03:20.470> arcane<00:03:20.829> so<00:03:21.100> that's

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
as the divine allegiant arcane so that's

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.300 
as the divine allegiant arcane so that's
good<00:03:21.489> but<00:03:21.670> it<00:03:22.359> also<00:03:22.600> has<00:03:23.079> no<00:03:23.380> prior<00:03:23.709> bonus<00:03:24.130> now

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
good but it also has no prior bonus now

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.099 
good but it also has no prior bonus now
once<00:03:24.519> again<00:03:24.670> i<00:03:24.910> have<00:03:24.970> no<00:03:25.180> idea<00:03:25.299> if<00:03:25.510> it's<00:03:25.660> just<00:03:25.989> a

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
once again i have no idea if it's just a

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:28.140 
once again i have no idea if it's just a
mistake<00:03:26.230> by<00:03:26.680> them<00:03:26.920> i'm<00:03:27.250> pretty<00:03:27.670> sure<00:03:27.910> it<00:03:28.030> is

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
mistake by them i'm pretty sure it is

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.330 
mistake by them i'm pretty sure it is
but<00:03:28.180> while<00:03:28.720> the<00:03:29.079> divine<00:03:29.440> Legion<00:03:29.859> in<00:03:29.950> arcane

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
but while the divine Legion in arcane

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.129 
but while the divine Legion in arcane
all<00:03:30.549> have<00:03:30.700> a<00:03:30.730> plus<00:03:31.030> three<00:03:31.329> prior<00:03:31.569> bonus<00:03:31.959> I

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:32.139 
all have a plus three prior bonus I

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:34.500 
all have a plus three prior bonus I
looked<00:03:32.650> at<00:03:32.739> a<00:03:32.769> spectral<00:03:33.310> and<00:03:33.489> it<00:03:33.579> didn't<00:03:34.030> so

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
looked at a spectral and it didn't so

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:35.789 
looked at a spectral and it didn't so
I'm<00:03:34.660> not<00:03:34.900> sure<00:03:34.959> what's<00:03:35.319> going<00:03:35.470> on<00:03:35.620> with<00:03:35.680> that

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
I'm not sure what's going on with that

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:38.970 
I'm not sure what's going on with that
and<00:03:36.450> also<00:03:37.450> like<00:03:37.720> I<00:03:37.810> said<00:03:37.989> there's<00:03:38.230> no<00:03:38.380> class<00:03:38.650> so

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
and also like I said there's no class so

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.170 
and also like I said there's no class so
I<00:03:39.130> don't<00:03:39.250> really<00:03:39.400> know<00:03:39.639> what's<00:03:39.790> going<00:03:39.819> on<00:03:40.060> with

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
I don't really know what's going on with

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.879 
I don't really know what's going on with
spectral<00:03:40.690> it's<00:03:40.900> obviously<00:03:41.260> going<00:03:41.380> to<00:03:41.440> be<00:03:41.560> way

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:41.889 
spectral it's obviously going to be way

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:43.770 
spectral it's obviously going to be way
worse<00:03:42.099> now<00:03:42.400> because<00:03:42.459> basically<00:03:42.970> a<00:03:43.299> bandeau

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
worse now because basically a bandeau

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.289 
worse now because basically a bandeau
sand<00:03:44.109> or<00:03:44.290> Armadale<00:03:44.829> shield<00:03:45.160> there'll<00:03:46.030> be<00:03:46.060> no

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
sand or Armadale shield there'll be no

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:48.180 
sand or Armadale shield there'll be no
point<00:03:46.510> using<00:03:46.690> the<00:03:47.049> spectral<00:03:47.470> over<00:03:47.769> bandits<00:03:48.160> or

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
point using the spectral over bandits or

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.659 
point using the spectral over bandits or
are<00:03:48.340> those<00:03:48.519> field<00:03:48.819> unless<00:03:49.739> unless<00:03:50.739> they<00:03:50.889> give

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:51.669 
are those field unless unless they give

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:53.309 
are those field unless unless they give
like<00:03:51.910> a<00:03:51.940> special<00:03:52.299> ability<00:03:52.660> of<00:03:52.750> the<00:03:52.840> spectral

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:53.319 
like a special ability of the spectral

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:55.409 
like a special ability of the spectral
or<00:03:53.530> maybe<00:03:53.829> a<00:03:54.160> special<00:03:54.819> is<00:03:54.910> going<00:03:54.940> to<00:03:55.090> be<00:03:55.180> the

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:55.419 
or maybe a special is going to be the

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:57.390 
or maybe a special is going to be the
classmate<00:03:56.049> because<00:03:56.470> bandeau<00:03:56.859> shield<00:03:57.190> is

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
classmate because bandeau shield is

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.699 
classmate because bandeau shield is
class<00:03:58.150> melee<00:03:58.599> a<00:03:58.630> nominal<00:03:59.139> shield<00:03:59.349> is<00:03:59.470> class

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
class melee a nominal shield is class

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.190 
class melee a nominal shield is class
range<00:04:00.099> so<00:04:00.549> maybe<00:04:00.880> spectral<00:04:01.630> will<00:04:01.780> now<00:04:01.900> be<00:04:02.079> the

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
range so maybe spectral will now be the

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.050 
range so maybe spectral will now be the
class<00:04:02.410> made<00:04:02.769> shield<00:04:03.190> and<00:04:03.459> maybe<00:04:03.910> they<00:04:04.030> just

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
class made shield and maybe they just

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.349 
class made shield and maybe they just
forgot<00:04:04.239> to<00:04:04.450> put<00:04:04.630> the<00:04:04.660> class<00:04:04.930> in<00:04:05.169> so<00:04:06.359> yeah

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:07.359 
forgot to put the class in so yeah

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:09.420 
forgot to put the class in so yeah
that's<00:04:07.450> all<00:04:07.599> I'd<00:04:07.720> say<00:04:07.750> I<00:04:08.290> know<00:04:08.980> that<00:04:09.220> a<00:04:09.250> lot<00:04:09.310> of

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
that's all I'd say I know that a lot of

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.580 
that's all I'd say I know that a lot of
people<00:04:09.519> weren't<00:04:10.030> actually<00:04:10.239> able<00:04:10.510> to<00:04:10.660> take<00:04:11.560> a

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
people weren't actually able to take a

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.559 
people weren't actually able to take a
look<00:04:11.739> at<00:04:11.859> the<00:04:11.950> spectral<00:04:12.430> and<00:04:12.639> also<00:04:13.329> a<00:04:13.359> lot<00:04:13.540> of

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:13.569 
look at the spectral and also a lot of

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:14.610 
look at the spectral and also a lot of
people<00:04:13.810> didn't<00:04:14.019> know<00:04:14.109> what<00:04:14.260> was<00:04:14.319> going<00:04:14.530> on

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620
