00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
camera is I'm going to do a couple of

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.999 
camera is I'm going to do a couple of
these<00:01:46.740> one<00:01:47.280> will<00:01:47.430> be<00:01:47.520> half<00:01:48.170> half<00:01:49.170> step<00:01:49.770> and

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
these one will be half half step and

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.590 
these one will be half half step and
then<00:01:50.159> all<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.430> way<00:01:50.520> in<00:01:50.729> once<00:01:51.030> it's<00:01:51.180> focused

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
then all the way in once it's focused

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.850 
then all the way in once it's focused
and<00:01:51.720> then<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.899> second<00:01:52.200> will<00:01:52.290> be<00:01:52.409> all<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.829> way

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
and then the second will be all the way

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.520 
and then the second will be all the way
down<00:01:53.720> and<00:01:54.720> just<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:55.079> you<00:01:55.170> can<00:01:55.290> see<00:01:55.439> the

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
down and just so you can see the

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.740 
down and just so you can see the
difference<00:01:55.860> so<00:01:56.100> that's<00:01:56.939> half<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.540> I'm<00:01:57.630> going

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
difference so that's half and I'm going

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.350 
difference so that's half and I'm going
to<00:01:57.780> press<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.200> now<00:01:58.729> so<00:01:59.729> there<00:01:59.939> was<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.090> little

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
to press it now so there was a little

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.510 
to press it now so there was a little
lag<00:02:00.540> there<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.110> then<00:02:01.710> of<00:02:01.799> course<00:02:01.829> I'll<00:02:02.219> do<00:02:02.340> one

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
lag there and then of course I'll do one

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.280 
lag there and then of course I'll do one
more<00:02:02.869> with<00:02:03.869> it<00:02:04.140> just<00:02:04.590> going<00:02:04.710> all<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.950> way<00:02:04.979> down

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
more with it just going all the way down

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.740 
more with it just going all the way down
there<00:02:07.290> we<00:02:07.409> are<00:02:08.179> so<00:02:09.179> you<00:02:09.300> see<00:02:09.450> there's<00:02:09.660> a

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
there we are so you see there's a

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.530 
there we are so you see there's a
there's<00:02:10.200> a<00:02:10.289> slight<00:02:10.500> sluggishness<00:02:11.129> to<00:02:11.610> it<00:02:11.819> but

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
there's a slight sluggishness to it but

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.820 
there's a slight sluggishness to it but
it's<00:02:12.720> not<00:02:12.900> d'etre

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
it's not d'etre

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.890 
it's not d'etre
the<00:02:14.220> camera<00:02:14.580> itself<00:02:14.820> one<00:02:15.420> thing<00:02:15.570> which<00:02:15.690> I'm<00:02:15.840> a

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
it'll take significantly longer to start

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.260 
it'll take significantly longer to start
recording<00:02:22.950> so<00:02:23.070> I'll<00:02:23.460> demonstrate<00:02:23.700> that<00:02:24.000> for

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
recording so I'll demonstrate that for

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.390 
recording so I'll demonstrate that for
you<00:02:24.720> right<00:02:24.930> now<00:02:24.960> I'll<00:02:25.440> press<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.190> movie

and<00:02:48.480> of<00:02:48.720> course<00:02:48.990> I'll<00:02:49.140> do<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.380> same<00:02:49.590> thing

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
and of course I'll do the same thing

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.550 
and of course I'll do the same thing
again<00:02:50.010> with<00:02:50.490> the<00:02:50.820> picture<00:02:51.360> the<00:02:52.050> pictures

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
again with the picture the pictures

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.670 
again with the picture the pictures
themselves<00:02:52.680> are<00:02:53.280> really<00:02:54.180> really<00:02:55.170> good<00:02:55.440> and

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
themselves are really really good and

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.320 
themselves are really really good and
the<00:02:55.890> videos<00:02:56.250> are<00:02:56.459> also<00:02:56.610> very<00:02:56.970> good<00:02:57.180> you've

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
the videos are also very good you've

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.180 
the videos are also very good you've
noticed<00:02:57.720> probably<00:02:58.200> that<00:02:58.410> it<00:02:58.500> has<00:02:58.620> dual

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
noticed probably that it has dual

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.830 
noticed probably that it has dual
microphones<00:02:59.700> at<00:02:59.790> the<00:02:59.850> front<00:03:00.090> which<00:03:00.480> will<00:03:00.630> help

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
microphones at the front which will help

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.540 
microphones at the front which will help
with<00:03:00.990> the<00:03:01.110> stereo<00:03:01.620> sound<00:03:03.590> not<00:03:04.590> to<00:03:04.620> mention<00:03:05.160> the

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
underwater yet but based on how these

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:04.220 
underwater yet but based on how these
flaps<00:05:00.419> work<00:05:00.840> I<00:05:01.200> think<00:05:01.890> that<00:05:03.050> I'll<00:05:04.050> be

have<00:05:38.220> to<00:05:38.280> carry<00:05:38.520> around<00:05:38.640> the<00:05:39.180> better<00:05:39.390> and<00:05:39.630> this

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
have to carry around the better and this

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.200 
have to carry around the better and this
charger<00:05:40.530> is<00:05:40.560> tiny<00:05:41.100> compared<00:05:41.640> to<00:05:41.669> the<00:05:41.729> previous

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210 
charger is tiny compared to the previous

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.240 
charger is tiny compared to the previous
battery<00:05:42.570> charger<00:05:42.990> and<00:05:43.140> of<00:05:43.890> course<00:05:44.070> you<00:05:44.160> have

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
battery charger and of course you have

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.490 
battery charger and of course you have
the<00:05:44.370> two<00:05:44.550> separate<00:05:44.970> gaskets<00:05:45.390> there<00:05:45.630> which

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 
the two separate gaskets there which

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.940 
the two separate gaskets there which
will<00:05:46.919> help<00:05:47.130> this<00:05:47.370> camera<00:05:47.820> stay<00:05:48.710> airtight<00:05:49.710> and

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:49.950 
will help this camera stay airtight and

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:50.570 
will help this camera stay airtight and
watertight

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 
watertight

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.969 
watertight
up<00:05:51.150> to<00:05:51.539> 5<00:05:51.930> meters<00:05:52.110> which<00:05:52.380> I'm<00:05:52.530> going<00:05:52.680> to<00:05:52.770> try<00:05:52.950> to

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:52.979 
up to 5 meters which I'm going to try to

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:54.969 
up to 5 meters which I'm going to try to
go<00:05:53.250> a<00:05:53.280> bit<00:05:53.340> deeper<00:05:53.490> and<00:05:53.880> see<00:05:54.060> if<00:05:54.180> that<00:05:54.390> will<00:05:54.539> if

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:54.979 
go a bit deeper and see if that will if

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:58.100 
go a bit deeper and see if that will if
that'll<00:05:55.979> survive<00:05:56.370> past<00:05:56.850> 5<00:05:57.180> though<00:05:57.720> I<00:05:58.020> don't

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.110 
that'll survive past 5 though I don't

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.100 
that'll survive past 5 though I don't
suspect<00:05:58.590> it<00:05:58.740> will<00:05:58.860> too<00:05:59.520> much<00:05:59.700> deeper<00:06:00.110> anyway

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.110 
suspect it will too much deeper anyway

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.070 
suspect it will too much deeper anyway
that's<00:06:01.470> all<00:06:01.680> folks<00:06:02.270> and<00:06:03.270> I<00:06:03.600> hope<00:06:03.810> you've

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 
that's all folks and I hope you've

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.979 
that's all folks and I hope you've
enjoyed<00:06:04.410> the<00:06:04.650> video
