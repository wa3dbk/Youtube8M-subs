00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:21.650 
going to be making now that I'm

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.920 
going to be making now that I'm

basically done with my roster what I

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.480 
basically done with my roster what I
wanted<00:00:24.170> to<00:00:24.260> discuss<00:00:24.590> in<00:00:24.710> this<00:00:24.830> video<00:00:25.010> is

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:25.490 
wanted to discuss in this video is

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:26.710 
wanted to discuss in this video is
something<00:00:25.939> that<00:00:26.060> I've<00:00:26.150> been<00:00:26.300> thinking<00:00:26.450> about

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
something that I've been thinking about

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.089 
something that I've been thinking about
for<00:00:26.869> a<00:00:27.050> while<00:00:27.110> whenever<00:00:27.619> I<00:00:27.710> consider

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:28.099 
for a while whenever I consider

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:30.760 
for a while whenever I consider
characters<00:00:28.900> pretty<00:00:29.900> much<00:00:30.050> the<00:00:30.230> concept<00:00:30.680> I

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:30.770 
characters pretty much the concept I

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.580 
characters pretty much the concept I
want<00:00:30.919> to<00:00:30.980> bring<00:00:31.130> up<00:00:31.279> is<00:00:31.460> that<00:00:32.590> representation

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 
want to bring up is that representation

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.000 
want to bring up is that representation
is<00:00:33.800> not<00:00:33.860> everything<00:00:34.960> for<00:00:35.960> example<00:00:36.020> when

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
is not everything for example when

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.550 
is not everything for example when
considering<00:00:37.430> Mario<00:00:37.820> characters<00:00:38.090> toad<00:00:39.050> seems

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:39.560 
considering Mario characters toad seems

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.889 
considering Mario characters toad seems
like<00:00:39.829> the<00:00:40.160> character<00:00:40.579> who's<00:00:41.329> next<00:00:41.690> in<00:00:41.870> line

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:41.899 
like the character who's next in line

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:44.709 
like the character who's next in line
for<00:00:42.130> recurrence<00:00:43.130> and<00:00:43.430> recognizability<00:00:44.149> and

00:00:44.709 --> 00:00:44.719 
for recurrence and recognizability and

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:48.670 
for recurrence and recognizability and
he<00:00:45.350> is<00:00:46.239> when<00:00:47.239> considering<00:00:47.690> Zelda<00:00:48.199> characters

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
he is when considering Zelda characters

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.580 
he is when considering Zelda characters
the<00:00:49.039> same<00:00:49.190> could<00:00:49.370> be<00:00:49.399> said<00:00:49.489> for<00:00:49.670> tingle

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 
the same could be said for tingle

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.930 
the same could be said for tingle
assuming<00:00:51.590> already<00:00:51.890> that<00:00:52.100> we're<00:00:52.219> getting<00:00:52.670> the

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
assuming already that we're getting the

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.529 
assuming already that we're getting the
obvious<00:00:53.359> she<00:00:54.050> camper<00:00:54.379> replacement<00:00:55.390> but<00:00:56.390> yeah

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 
obvious she camper replacement but yeah

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:00.040 
obvious she camper replacement but yeah
even<00:00:56.949> though<00:00:57.949> these<00:00:58.429> characters<00:00:58.910> can<00:00:59.660> fight

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
even though these characters can fight

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.259 
even though these characters can fight
and<00:01:00.289> aren't<00:01:01.160> leaving<00:01:01.280> my<00:01:01.519> roster<00:01:01.910> anytime

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:02.269 
and aren't leaving my roster anytime

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:04.600 
and aren't leaving my roster anytime
soon<00:01:02.539> I'm<00:01:03.289> not<00:01:03.350> really<00:01:03.859> sure<00:01:04.280> how

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
soon I'm not really sure how

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.370 
soon I'm not really sure how
well-received<00:01:05.480> they'd<00:01:05.810> be<00:01:05.990> if<00:01:06.110> they<00:01:06.320> were

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
well-received they'd be if they were

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.580 
well-received they'd be if they were
actually<00:01:07.040> announced<00:01:07.520> for<00:01:07.640> the<00:01:07.700> game<00:01:08.590> and

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
actually announced for the game and

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.230 
actually announced for the game and
don't<00:01:09.830> get<00:01:09.920> me<00:01:10.040> wrong<00:01:10.150> representation<00:01:11.150> is

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
don't get me wrong representation is

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.470 
don't get me wrong representation is
important<00:01:12.190> because<00:01:13.190> if<00:01:13.760> you<00:01:13.940> overly

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:14.480 
important because if you overly

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.050 
important because if you overly
misrepresent<00:01:15.230> a<00:01:15.290> series<00:01:15.680> that<00:01:15.950> upsets<00:01:16.820> fans

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
misrepresent a series that upsets fans

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.170 
misrepresent a series that upsets fans
of<00:01:17.240> that<00:01:17.360> series<00:01:18.580> but<00:01:19.580> you<00:01:19.700> really<00:01:19.940> shouldn't

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
of that series but you really shouldn't

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.920 
of that series but you really shouldn't
go<00:01:20.330> overboard<00:01:22.090> like<00:01:23.090> some<00:01:23.390> people<00:01:23.630> think<00:01:23.840> that

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
go overboard like some people think that

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.720 
go overboard like some people think that
you<00:01:24.050> need<00:01:24.500> to<00:01:24.560> thoroughly<00:01:24.890> represent<00:01:25.610> each

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:25.730 
you need to thoroughly represent each

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.090 
you need to thoroughly represent each
part<00:01:26.030> of<00:01:26.120> the<00:01:26.210> Zelda<00:01:26.570> timeline<00:01:26.740> or<00:01:27.740> every

myself<00:01:32.960> a<00:01:33.560> little<00:01:33.770> sometimes<00:01:34.540> but<00:01:35.540> yeah<00:01:35.720> it's

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
myself a little sometimes but yeah it's

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.030 
stick making the characters Nintendo
all-stars<00:01:55.820> was<00:01:56.000> an<00:01:56.090> afterthought<00:01:56.540> I<00:01:57.040> think

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
all-stars was an afterthought I think

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.350 
all-stars was an afterthought I think
that<00:01:58.160> those<00:01:58.310> of<00:01:58.340> us<00:01:58.550> who<00:01:58.700> get<00:01:59.210> into

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
that those of us who get into

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.720 
that those of us who get into
speculation<00:02:00.050> about<00:02:00.230> characters<00:02:00.680> lose<00:02:01.460> sight

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:01.730 
speculation about characters lose sight

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.390 
speculation about characters lose sight
of<00:02:01.760> this<00:02:01.970> concept<00:02:02.450> a<00:02:02.540> little<00:02:02.980> now<00:02:03.980> I'm<00:02:04.250> not

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
of this concept a little now I'm not

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.130 
of this concept a little now I'm not
saying<00:02:04.580> smash<00:02:05.000> should<00:02:05.270> deviate<00:02:05.780> from<00:02:05.810> the

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
saying smash should deviate from the

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.040 
saying smash should deviate from the
Nintendo<00:02:06.350> all-stars<00:02:07.010> concept<00:02:07.460> at<00:02:07.550> all<00:02:08.050> that's

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
Nintendo all-stars concept at all that's

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.690 
Nintendo all-stars concept at all that's
what<00:02:09.170> made<00:02:09.289> Smash<00:02:09.590> Bros<00:02:09.830> so<00:02:09.979> successful<00:02:10.580> and

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
what made Smash Bros so successful and

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:11.949 
what made Smash Bros so successful and
if<00:02:10.759> anything<00:02:10.970> I<00:02:11.180> think<00:02:11.420> they<00:02:11.510> should<00:02:11.720> do<00:02:11.840> it

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
if anything I think they should do it

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.290 
if anything I think they should do it
more<00:02:12.250> like<00:02:13.250> with<00:02:13.400> the<00:02:13.489> adventure<00:02:13.849> mode<00:02:14.000> having

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
more like with the adventure mode having
