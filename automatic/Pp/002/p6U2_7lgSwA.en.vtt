making the fume funnel the recipes on
the<00:03:20.410> screen<00:03:20.680> right<00:03:20.980> now<00:03:22.709> alright<00:03:23.709> guys<00:03:23.890> now

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
the screen right now alright guys now

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.650 
the screen right now alright guys now
what<00:03:24.549> you<00:03:24.640> do<00:03:24.760> is<00:03:24.790> once<00:03:25.060> you've<00:03:25.180> built<00:03:25.450> that

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
what you do is once you've built that

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.319 
what you do is once you've built that
you<00:03:25.900> put<00:03:26.110> it<00:03:26.230> on<00:03:26.410> I<00:03:26.440> over<00:03:26.739> the<00:03:26.829> left<00:03:27.269> or<00:03:28.269> the

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.329 
you put it on I over the left or the

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:31.350 
you put it on I over the left or the
right<00:03:29.100> now<00:03:30.100> will<00:03:30.280> increase<00:03:30.670> the<00:03:30.910> speed<00:03:31.150> of

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
right now will increase the speed of

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.600 
right now will increase the speed of
coking<00:03:31.720> by<00:03:31.870> ten<00:03:32.140> percent<00:03:32.170> and<00:03:32.829> the<00:03:32.860> the

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
coking by ten percent and the the

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:39.030 
coking by ten percent and the the
chances<00:03:34.150> of<00:03:34.769> getting<00:03:35.769> the<00:03:36.570> list<00:03:37.570> the<00:03:38.040> themes

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
chances of getting the list the themes

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.180 
chances of getting the list the themes
you<00:03:39.310> want<00:03:39.519> by<00:03:40.269> twenty-five<00:03:40.750> percent<00:03:40.959> so<00:03:41.829> I

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
you want by twenty-five percent so I

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.490 
you want by twenty-five percent so I
believe<00:03:42.820> only<00:03:43.150> one<00:03:43.540> will<00:03:43.750> take<00:03:43.959> effect<00:03:44.260> with

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
believe only one will take effect with

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:45.870 
believe only one will take effect with
this<00:03:44.650> so<00:03:44.829> it<00:03:44.920> will<00:03:45.010> still<00:03:45.160> be<00:03:45.190> ten<00:03:45.519> percent

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
this so it will still be ten percent

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.560 
this so it will still be ten percent
faster<00:03:46.709> twenty-five<00:03:47.709> percent<00:03:48.120> more<00:03:49.120> chance<00:03:49.390> i

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
faster twenty-five percent more chance i

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.940 
faster twenty-five percent more chance i
think<00:03:49.750> that's<00:03:49.959> but<00:03:50.320> you<00:03:50.440> can<00:03:50.769> also

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
think that's but you can also

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.770 
think that's but you can also
I<00:03:52.040> can<00:03:52.730> tell<00:03:54.160> ya<00:03:55.160> to<00:03:55.640> weggies<00:03:56.090> urban's<00:03:56.420> could

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
I can tell ya to weggies urban's could

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.400 
I can tell ya to weggies urban's could
actually<00:03:57.080> share<00:03:57.709> a<00:03:57.739> few<00:03:58.160> a<00:03:58.459> funnel<00:03:59.260> you<00:04:00.260> can

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
actually share a few a funnel you can

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.509 
actually share a few a funnel you can
also<00:04:00.590> guys<00:04:01.040> put<00:04:01.580> a<00:04:01.760> funnel<00:04:02.209> directly<00:04:02.870> on<00:04:02.989> top

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
also guys put a funnel directly on top

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:05.920 
also guys put a funnel directly on top
of<00:04:04.519> the<00:04:04.670> witches<00:04:04.849> oven<00:04:05.180> which<00:04:05.300> makes<00:04:05.720> you<00:04:05.840> look

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
of the witches oven which makes you look

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.250 
of the witches oven which makes you look
better<00:04:06.140> and<00:04:06.430> also<00:04:07.510> increases<00:04:08.510> the<00:04:08.630> speed<00:04:08.750> by<00:04:09.230> a

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
better and also increases the speed by a

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.850 
better and also increases the speed by a
further<00:04:09.680> ten<00:04:09.980> percent<00:04:10.340> so<00:04:10.670> with<00:04:11.450> one<00:04:12.380> funnel

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
further ten percent so with one funnel

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.559 
further ten percent so with one funnel
two<00:04:13.069> funnels<00:04:13.459> and<00:04:13.550> one<00:04:13.760> which<00:04:13.970> is<00:04:14.000> over<00:04:14.360> new

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:14.569 
two funnels and one which is over new

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:17.530 
two funnels and one which is over new
you<00:04:15.500> have<00:04:15.709> twenty<00:04:16.100> percent<00:04:16.400> better<00:04:16.790> speed<00:04:17.269> and

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
you have twenty percent better speed and

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.180 
you have twenty percent better speed and
twenty-five<00:04:18.079> percent<00:04:18.229> more<00:04:18.680> chance<00:04:18.950> of

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
twenty-five percent more chance of

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.430 
twenty-five percent more chance of
getting<00:04:19.880> your<00:04:20.030> themes<00:04:22.120> right<00:04:23.120> guys<00:04:23.360> I<00:04:23.630> should

getting your themes right guys I should

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.680 
getting your themes right guys I should
probably<00:04:24.680> go<00:04:25.040> on<00:04:25.070> to<00:04:28.000> tell<00:04:29.000> you<00:04:29.180> how<00:04:29.330> to<00:04:29.389> make
