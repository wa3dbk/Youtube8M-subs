pickups and I'm really really happy with
this<00:00:30.330> tone<00:00:30.570> I<00:00:30.599> think<00:00:30.720> it<00:00:30.929> sounds<00:00:31.080> great<00:00:31.380> so

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
this tone I think it sounds great so

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.680 
this tone I think it sounds great so
just<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.160> bit<00:00:32.279> of<00:00:32.399> background<00:00:32.820> this<00:00:32.940> patch<00:00:33.270> took

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
just a bit of background this patch took

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.569 
just a bit of background this patch took
quite<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.079> while<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.710> I<00:00:34.829> literally<00:00:35.160> just<00:00:35.430> had

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
quite a while and I literally just had

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.639 
quite a while and I literally just had
to<00:00:35.670> keep<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:36.000> being<00:00:36.329> in-between<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.960> album<00:00:37.440> and

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
to keep a being in-between the album and

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.490 
to keep a being in-between the album and
the<00:00:38.520> amp<00:00:38.760> until<00:00:39.300> I<00:00:39.329> got<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.600> comparable<00:00:40.200> sound

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
the amp until I got a comparable sound

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.080 
the amp until I got a comparable sound
the<00:00:40.890> hard<00:00:41.070> part<00:00:41.340> was<00:00:41.489> getting<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.879> right

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
the hard part was getting the right

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.819 
the hard part was getting the right
amount<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.450> breakup<00:00:42.840> so<00:00:43.170> depending<00:00:43.649> on<00:00:43.710> your

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
amount of breakup so depending on your

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.770 
amount of breakup so depending on your
volume<00:00:44.280> will<00:00:44.460> depend<00:00:44.820> on<00:00:44.940> how<00:00:45.120> much<00:00:45.270> gain<00:00:45.600> you

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
volume will depend on how much gain you

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.990 
volume will depend on how much gain you
want<00:00:46.020> on<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.379> actual<00:00:46.800> studio<00:00:47.190> recording<00:00:47.879> it

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
want on the actual studio recording it

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.150 
want on the actual studio recording it
sounds<00:00:48.360> like<00:00:48.480> there's<00:00:48.750> not<00:00:48.930> only<00:00:49.170> Stevie's

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
sounds like there's not only Stevie's

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.160 
sounds like there's not only Stevie's
sort<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.550> amp<00:00:50.820> reverb<00:00:51.600> but<00:00:51.809> there's<00:00:52.020> an

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
sort of amp reverb but there's an

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.410 
sort of amp reverb but there's an
ambient<00:00:52.770> reverb<00:00:53.190> which<00:00:53.370> I've<00:00:53.520> also<00:00:53.820> added<00:00:54.329> to

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
ambient reverb which I've also added to

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.060 
ambient reverb which I've also added to
give<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.719> bit<00:00:54.870> more<00:00:55.050> sort<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.379> lushness<00:00:55.829> and

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
give it a bit more sort of lushness and

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.830 
give it a bit more sort of lushness and
smoothness<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.879> I<00:00:57.120> think<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.360> sounds<00:00:57.510> pretty

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
smoothness and I think it sounds pretty

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.170 
smoothness and I think it sounds pretty
close<00:00:57.960> especially<00:00:58.260> on<00:00:58.649> some<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.180> lead

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
close especially on some of the lead

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.790 
close especially on some of the lead
parts<00:01:00.600> while<00:01:00.870> I've<00:01:00.989> also<00:01:01.109> added<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.590> tube

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
parts while I've also added the tube

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.200 
parts while I've also added the tube
screamer<00:01:01.920> so<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:02.699> can<00:01:02.789> click<00:01:02.940> that<00:01:03.059> on<00:01:03.180> a

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
screamer so you can click that on a

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.969 
screamer so you can click that on a
place<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.629> lead<00:01:03.780> as<00:01:03.960> well<00:01:04.140> so<00:01:04.680> let's<00:01:04.860> give

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
place and lead as well so let's give

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.859 
place and lead as well so let's give
this<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.159> shot<00:01:05.250> so<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.180> should<00:01:06.330> probably<00:01:06.390> note

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
this a shot so you should probably note

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.420 
this a shot so you should probably note
that<00:01:07.140> I've<00:01:07.320> never<00:01:07.439> gone<00:01:07.680> out<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:08.189> try<00:01:08.369> to

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.399 
that I've never gone out to try to
directly<00:01:08.909> replicate<00:01:09.570> Stevie<00:01:09.960> Ray<00:01:10.170> Vaughan

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409

I<00:01:20.610> had<00:01:20.729> my<00:01:20.880> own<00:01:21.000> distinct<00:01:21.509> flavour<00:01:21.840> on<00:01:21.990> stuff

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
I had my own distinct flavour on stuff

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.800 
I had my own distinct flavour on stuff
so<00:01:22.380> at<00:01:23.220> least<00:01:23.430> I<00:01:23.549> hope<00:01:23.759> so<00:01:24.090> so<00:01:24.390> let's<00:01:24.570> give<00:01:24.689> this

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
so at least I hope so so let's give this

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:48.679 
so at least I hope so so let's give this
a<00:01:24.869> shot

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.169 

so<00:01:49.649> there's<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:50.009> section<00:01:50.250> on<00:01:50.429> this<00:01:50.579> song<00:01:50.789> where

00:01:51.169 --> 00:01:51.179 
so there's a section on this song where

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:53.270 
so there's a section on this song where
Stevie's<00:01:51.689> got<00:01:51.960> his<00:01:52.079> guitar<00:01:52.439> volume<00:01:52.649> down<00:01:53.009> he's

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
Stevie's got his guitar volume down he's

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.399 
Stevie's got his guitar volume down he's
just<00:01:53.310> sort<00:01:53.729> of<00:01:53.789> soloing<00:01:54.689> around<00:01:54.960> playing<00:01:55.229> some

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
just sort of soloing around playing some

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.639 
just sort of soloing around playing some
fast<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:56.100> some<00:01:56.369> slow<00:01:56.640> bits<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.380> this<00:01:58.380> is<00:01:58.500> how

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
fast and some slow bits and this is how

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:21.000 
fast and some slow bits and this is how
it<00:01:58.770> sounds<00:01:58.950> so

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.080 

so<00:02:22.010> this<00:02:22.190> is<00:02:22.280> how<00:02:22.400> it<00:02:22.520> sounds<00:02:22.760> now<00:02:22.819> with<00:02:23.000> the

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
so this is how it sounds now with the

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:58.369 
so this is how it sounds now with the
