00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.390
 Hello everyone and welcome to the channel 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.760
 txingas 12 I will teach how to make a 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.830
 tweezers gun for this we need 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.450
 the clip with the hook and all without 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.960
 disassemble a pair of tongs to cut 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.820
 wire good the wire and then also 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.860
 so to cut we have to carve 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.920
 the wood that has tweezers so I 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.570
 I have here a razor for good one 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.580
 knife would be good a good knife a 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.680
 cutter a razor blade whatever 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.180
 something that cuts very well and the file is 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.180
 Well, just in case I use it though 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:35.050
 either to give blows to start we have 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.050
 to disassemble the clamp 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.420
 ah 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.450
 well we're going to stay with the three 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.700
 parts that has the dock will be what 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.010
 that then shoot and the two parties the 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.400
 we have to cut with a cutter or with 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.040
 some low a blade whatever it is for 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.950
 where are we going to mark with the pencil I'm going to 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.440
 mark the and I teach you good I already have 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.239
 here marked what you have to cut 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.739
 we have to cut out all this part the 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.120
 ditch at the height of this gap that 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.760
 has here the pieces at the height of 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.580
 this gap must be cut then here 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.410
 you have to make a ditch that is where 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.910
 it's like the canyon is where the 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.160
 projectile that we are going to launch in this 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.650
 case a wire this is for both 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.940
 sides in this part of here that you see is 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.410
 deeper this is so that it 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.720
 hitch 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:27.479
 this piece metal quote this piece of 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.910
 metal is going to hook one side here the 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.350
 mestre web is left and the other one here we have 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.910
 to cut back a little so that you can hold on 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.860
 better because here it is now rounded 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.490
 so you do not see that it rounds and you can 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.110
 letting go and giving the blow is not the hand 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.180
 well then let's cut it out with 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.050
 this we are removing little by little 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.050
 and I teach you 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.690
 well we have finished we have it already 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.200
 all carved that do not forget to see there 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:54.440
 have this part here 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:58.129
 this has to be carved this here is that 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.360
 detail the line for the guide and this 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:01.819
 another hole that is bigger more 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.319
 deep yet to unite the only thing that 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:07.629
 we have to do is place it before 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:07.629
 join the piece of metal place it 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.370
 we have to stay like this and now the other 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.750
 part simply paste it with glue 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.360
 with good wire I'm going to use the 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:28.470
 wire because it is faster than the tail 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.470
 then we put like this 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.190
 and with a piece of wire 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.510
 Y 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.900
 with a hungry bowl we're going to stick it 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.380
 yes 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.610
 ah 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:37.720
 Well, the gun would be ready now. 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.400
 to prove it and show them the good cause 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.250
 to use it what we have to do is 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.470
 first load the weapon we have to throw 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.680
 this tab here until the hole that 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.680
 there is here 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.210
 it has to be such that 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.980
 then cut a piece of straight wire 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:01.070
 one side we have to cut it like this 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:05.270
 angle so that to make the tip of 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.270
 the arrow or whatever you want to call it 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.830
 and the other side should be flat not 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:13.680
 straighten everything possible 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:16.060
 and we put it in, we have to put it in the 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.570
 side that we have cut plane 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.570
 A) Yes 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.830
 well I would be ready to shoot 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.850
 now just when we press this 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.850
 work is going to shoot 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.069
 well let's do a few more 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.069
 tests 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.690
 we see how it sticks perfectly 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.240
 you see that this video is not cut or 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.070
 nothing that I'm hitting four of four 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.960
 or five I do not know how many 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:17.610
 one or the other if it fails but if 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.910
 you do well the truth is that it is very 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.910
 effective
