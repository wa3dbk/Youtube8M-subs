00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:10.410
 the fifth generation of the new missile system 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.740
 21st century miracle weapon 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.049
 such epithets are awarded with poplar not 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.930
 only military journalists but strict 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.700
 experts today on the fields in 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.510
 the most modern Russian rocket 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.520
 complex 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:28.560
 its developer at the Moscow Institute 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:30.150
 heating engineering poplar-m from 27 to western 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.250
 the classification was the result 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.180
 further modification of the famous 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.989
 complex stamp it equipped with modern 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.239
 intercontinental ballistic missile 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.850
 rs 12 m2 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.949
 this rocket has 3 advanced 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.350
 mid-flight solid engine 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:48.629
 thanks to which she can leave with 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.839
 launch before enemy satellites 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.760
 scouts will spot her coordinates yet 

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:55.530
 several dozen auxiliary 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.350
 engines and a better mechanism 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.749
 controls make flying rockets difficult 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.569
 predictable for computer facilities 

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:06.450
 enemy's defense to knock them off 

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:09.420
 confusing new poplar carrying 3 warheads 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.549
 releases and 4 false 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.590
 rocket launch can be made from 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.810
 any point of the patrol route 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.090
 if necessary, it can be done 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.009
 straight from the hangar while parking for 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.890
 maintenance through 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.689
 sliding roof for starting with no 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.640
 equipped position starting 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.310
 the device extends on the jacks 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.920
 preparation time to start about 2 minutes 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.990
 after installation of canisters vertical 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.590
 position and from the arrow of his top 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.539
 cap 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.490
 powder pressure accumulators 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:39.360
 pushing a rocket to a height of several 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.030
 meters 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.759
 then the march is launched 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.940
 engine first stage planned 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.770
 something scorched will have to replace 270 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.420
 mining complexes with 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.649
 rockets 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.979
 equipped with separable head 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:58.770
 in parts it is primarily ballistic 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:02.039
 liquid rockets and solid fuel rs

 22 created in the early 80s 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:10.670
 they must be replaced by 350 mobiles 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.670
 complexes on the basis of 8 again tractors maz 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:16.349
 according to the military plan it should be poplar 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.890
 to form the basis of rocket troops 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:24.269
 strategic purpose after 2015 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.980
 year and up to the middle of the 21st century coal mine 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.730
 version of the rocket is already fighting 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.639
 duty 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.780
 today rs complex 

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:34.109
 12 m2 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:37.590
 equipped with 4 missile shelves each has 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:39.870
 10 launchers in perspective 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.269
 Ministry of Defense plans to form in RVSN 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.389
 several divisions armed with this 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:48.030
 rockets as for mobile stomped 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:49.980
 starting next year on combat 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.010
 duty will be set from three to 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:57.620
 six rockets each year they will 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.620
 equipped with several divisions RVSN 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.040
 popol-m is really unique 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.530
 defense complex analogs which 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.240
 the world is no 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.430
 modern intercontinental 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.110
 ballistic missiles capable and not 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.600
 only develop hypersonic speed 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:31.630
 but also change the flight path in flight 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.340
 height and course this rocket is able 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.370
 break through any missile defense 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:39.220
 adversary to the entire strategic depth 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.290
 not yet invented such a computer which 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.150
 could compute logic behavior 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.480
 new Russian missile system 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:49.060
 according to military experts on the one with 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.950
 27 today crosses out all 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.660
 the efforts of the Americans to create 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.590
 national missile system 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.500
 defense 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.959
 everything says that the United States will have you 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.170
 create your missile system with 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.170
 zero
