00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:09.010
 I would like to be able 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:11.190
 give you 1100 to say matter if I want 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:14.339
 be with a garlic 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.670
 what I feel what I feel is not 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:19.380
 true then I'm not going to lie to you 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.060
 that its unjust moment than for other 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.220
 people are paying us that 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.320
 we really had a couple with the 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.779
 that we had incredible that we have a 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.200
 incredible chemistry that punish those who 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.200
 they have to investigate 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:37.760
 that is going to hurt a lot in the 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.760
 artistic level 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.860
 and the connection 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:52.010
 and you do not help your partner much more 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.500
 charged because because in some way 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.809
 it's a lot going to be much easier than the 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.239
 tea drive if you also help is a 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:03.170
 little with your weight necessary to see you dance 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:05.180
 as as you more loose as what 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.340
 it 's always your repertoire 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.300
 I do not think much of what you're 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.670
 doing 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.320
 Take advantage of your partner because I think 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.180
 you can do much more than you are 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.899
 doing I think you are 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:20.080
 wasting and I'd like to see you more 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:20.080
 much more 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.070
 there was definitely a chemistry in 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.350
 both with ramón and with camila good 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.540
 chemistry in their dances they're going to have 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.010
 what to look for or find out of having 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.270
 who knows where the decision is already 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.270
 he took and the truth is that they are 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.030
 one of the 20 couples although we are missing 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.409
 still see some tomorrow but they are a 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.710
 of the 20 couples we've seen 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.940
 until now of 1415 more or less in 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.259
 we see ourselves growing in all 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.790
 the more we congratulate all 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.009
 We said evils and we do not invite them to 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.840
 prove that we were right I do not know why 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.159
 say they were right 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.200
 I loved seeing you with ramón is the 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.000
 true because they were wanted because 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.649
 I showed him on stage and I some 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.869
 I told ramón with the love that 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.369
 you have help to improve in the 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.619
 charged and I will improve be very 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:11.209
 sincere you remember I told him and they are 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:13.230
 happening that as ramón is not 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.819
 because ramón does not want to lose a 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.300
 detail not a second of what it does 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:20.040
 Maria Jose and it's not hallway gossip is 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.540
 feminine intuition in these couples there 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.790
 something and so much is that ramón is here 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.790
 tonight out there look at it here 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:35.640
 feminine or there is a love beyond what 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.750
 what happens on the track beyond the 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.960
 correct 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.660
 we are very good we are very friendly and there 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.640
 a complete communication between him and me 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.900
 he taught me so much I'm extremely 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.940
 grateful because it became a bond a lot 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.340
 more than being a talent dancer like 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.700
 better other couples if they have it like that I 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:03:02.370
 yes I made a very partner tie with him and 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:03.780
 it was not his previous partner 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.880
 yesterday we saw ramón already walks in the 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.870
 block and let me tell you that they were 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.870
 spectacular 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.250
 Well, I 'm really putting everything 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.780
 with Juan who is an excellent dancer and 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.610
 I respect him and admire him from the moment 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.110
 in which they presented it to me and the truth 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.050
 I'm also learning a lot 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.820
 because he straight room to everything and he is 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.560
 teaching too much the truth 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:32.660
 there is a group of splendid dancers 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.660
 in the production that we all help each other 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:39.430
 happy with bread too because I'm 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.430
 learning a lot 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.349

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.800
