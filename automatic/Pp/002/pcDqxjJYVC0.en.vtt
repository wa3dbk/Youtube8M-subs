for<00:03:15.780> a<00:03:15.810> sulfate<00:03:16.350> shampoo<00:03:16.380> I<00:03:17.040> do<00:03:17.130> recommend<00:03:17.730> it

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
for a sulfate shampoo I do recommend it

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.300 
for a sulfate shampoo I do recommend it
on<00:03:20.000> a<00:03:21.000> scale<00:03:21.420> of<00:03:21.450> one<00:03:21.750> to<00:03:21.780> ten<00:03:22.230> I<00:03:22.530> would<00:03:22.560> give<00:03:23.130> it

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
on a scale of one to ten I would give it

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:30.650 
on a scale of one to ten I would give it
like<00:03:24.180> a<00:03:24.210> 8.5<00:03:26.480> it's<00:03:27.480> really<00:03:27.960> really<00:03:28.590> good

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
like a 8.5 it's really really good

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.770 
like a 8.5 it's really really good
compare<00:03:31.260> it<00:03:31.290> to<00:03:31.530> other<00:03:31.770> shampoos<00:03:32.460> it<00:03:33.210> doesn't

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
compare it to other shampoos it doesn't

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.060 
compare it to other shampoos it doesn't
do<00:03:34.020> anything<00:03:34.770> you<00:03:35.370> know<00:03:35.550> out<00:03:35.760> of<00:03:35.790> the<00:03:35.970> ordinary

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
do anything you know out of the ordinary

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:43.160 
do anything you know out of the ordinary
you<00:03:38.070> know<00:03:38.250> but<00:03:38.670> it's<00:03:39.270> it's<00:03:39.660> pretty<00:03:39.960> good<00:03:41.810> so<00:03:42.810> oh

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
you know but it's it's pretty good so oh

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.820 
you know but it's it's pretty good so oh
I<00:03:43.650> forgot<00:03:44.010> to<00:03:44.160> tell<00:03:44.340> you<00:03:44.460> it<00:03:44.580> has<00:03:45.230> some<00:03:46.230> biotin

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
I forgot to tell you it has some biotin

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.030 
I forgot to tell you it has some biotin
in<00:03:47.010> it<00:03:47.190> and<00:03:47.490> my<00:03:48.030> hair<00:03:48.270> is<00:03:48.800> sensitive<00:03:49.800> to

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
in it and my hair is sensitive to

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.580 
in it and my hair is sensitive to
protein<00:03:50.760> meaning<00:03:51.660> it<00:03:51.810> doesn't<00:03:52.050> need<00:03:52.290> a<00:03:52.320> lot

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
protein meaning it doesn't need a lot

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.460 
protein meaning it doesn't need a lot
and<00:03:52.830> if<00:03:52.950> it<00:03:53.100> gets<00:03:53.250> too<00:03:53.640> much<00:03:53.670> it<00:03:54.600> will<00:03:54.930> act<00:03:55.230> up

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
and if it gets too much it will act up

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.880 
and if it gets too much it will act up
but<00:03:56.280> there<00:03:56.550> is<00:03:56.730> biotin<00:03:57.390> in<00:03:57.570> here<00:03:58.020> and<00:03:58.260> that's

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
but there is biotin in here and that's

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.590 
but there is biotin in here and that's
to<00:03:59.880> thicken<00:04:00.810> and<00:04:01.230> make<00:04:01.590> your<00:04:01.770> hair<00:04:02.160> stronger

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 
but I didn't have any issues with the

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:10.400 
but I didn't have any issues with the
biotin<00:04:07.400> um<00:04:08.400> I<00:04:08.820> meant<00:04:09.600> to<00:04:09.750> say<00:04:09.930> protein

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410
