 add people in our pan and 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.480
 Let's dry our ingredients.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:49.500
 four or five cloves garlic, minced 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.360
 so we 'll add 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:56.460
 also add approximately one 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:58.620

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:07.909
 we also add or broth 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:11.670
 meat and a tablet of beef broth and 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:14.729
 stir has and has to develop in the pan 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.820
 josÃ© mota already put it kneaded or 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.890
 advance it from the pan to dissolve 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.310
 better get more like 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:29.729
 Let's introduce two smoked calabresa 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:33.329
 cut into round slices and there 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.790
 stir until all ingredients are removed 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.549
 then who will play well until that 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.650
 pecially us off the fire pan 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.770
 pressure but we will believe the act 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:47.189
 medium potatoes peeled and our 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.390
 mix the whole new pan mixture 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.119
 braised 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:55.330
 Let's introduce a cup of tea. 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:58.060
 Cabbage butter in strips already washed 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:02.380
 and we're going to add approximately 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:06.130
 four to five glasses of water to you 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:09.580
 see that he spent more or less than dual and 12 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.470
 within your study on ingredients 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.370
 after presenting the water we 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:17.590
 add a little salt to taste 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:20.980
 mix a little bit talk once auntie 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.380
 and we will cover our pressure cooker 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.450
 and amplify the fire 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.320
 so now I have to wait to get the 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.600
 pressure 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:32.710
 so you see you got the pressure 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.840
 started to change the cap you count 20 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:37.030
 minutes from the time it was picked up 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.580
 the pressure then after 20 minutes 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.770
 you can turn the fire off that 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.709
 Careful person and open the pan 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.540
 there we will remove the 4 potatoes and 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.940
 place in the blender with a 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:52.420
 little cabbage you also get 4 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.580
 potatoes a little bit of the van puts on the 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.880
 blender we'll beat there 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:00.790
 these potatoes are going to come out and help us with 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.250
 a unifying statue then you go 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.800
 beat the 4 potatoes until it becomes a broth 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.680
 thicker this thick broth 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.780
 pressure cooker and with the help of a 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.790
 shell we will mix this well 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.120
 case in our guido - our 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:19.810

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.940
 ready ready to serve well renders 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:25.690

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:28.269
 mouth you serve you can eat with 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.489
 toast with bread whatever you want 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:32.709
 get better 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:35.830
 you can see out to the street so there is so 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:37.420
 hot that is our soup take care 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.890

 winter I learned to do and it's very 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.220
 good if you put a small toast a little 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.680
 Warm up, I can not eat alone. 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.550
