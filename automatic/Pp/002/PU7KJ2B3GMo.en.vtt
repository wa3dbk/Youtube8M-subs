00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:05.550
 Hello 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.880
 we send the correct position of the left hand on the handle of the guitar 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:13.769
 vito mirÃ² as you can see is wrong in this direction 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.259
 the index you dined lesson mail 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:21.089
 the weather martina as they throw it steal a video 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.269
 cry space fan all fingers 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:29.119
 equity and then there is my best match behind 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.100
 this position allows the lateral muscles of death to come into play 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.940
 let's get to know them 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.940
 apply pressure with the millet 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.710
 this position 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.510
 do not feel the shield in this part of the hand 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.920
 what happens 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.920
 do the same with the index 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.350
 and this time you will feel curtains on muscle 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.350
 in this position 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.510
 to these two muscles 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.510
 opposes thumb translator 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.900
 these three muscles together give security to the position of the hand is 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.900
 tanned worse fingers than quick and quick bites 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.610
 to learn how to maintain this position, practice this exercise 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.930
 I am convinced that there is on the third string at key 5 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.790
 and all the fingers on the keyboard are on the same thing 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.990
 the rope in the rest position 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.570
 I'll take it, but it puts the sore throat against the shoes 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.050
 I repeat the easiest thing to integrate 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.050
 try to change rope 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.990
 love those who practice this position, try also to move them 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.410
 individual life crib with ropes struck with mac and fairies 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:52.960
 movement like this 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.080
 observe with pesto joint movement to have the maximum of 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.300
 speed after the pap stop taking with the weather the other fingers are not affected 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.330
 in no way the movement of the middle neko shifts nor with variations of 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.519
 pressure 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:12.019
 try the index 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:15.019
 beat more than an inch in the middle 

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:19.989
 what to collaborate for lamps made thus unlocked the little finger with ice cream 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:23.109
 to the coque freedom of movement and try to 

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:26.759
 deal done then someone there is more bet with the gallarate schooner 

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:31.459
 wind in this natural way of radio network independent of the medium 

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:34.779
 here found that combined 

00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:38.849
 like this I recommend it for a couple of minutes every time you take it 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:40.629
 the instrument in hand 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:41.579
 then sygic all
