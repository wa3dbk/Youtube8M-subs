00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
in equipment similar to this but nowhere

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.270 
in equipment similar to this but nowhere
near<00:02:43.580> as<00:02:43.820> pristine<00:02:44.600> shape<00:02:44.900> as<00:02:45.110> this<00:02:45.320> is<00:02:45.530> so<00:02:46.250> I

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
near as pristine shape as this is so I

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.190 
near as pristine shape as this is so I
feel<00:02:46.640> confident<00:02:47.120> that<00:02:47.240> we<00:02:47.360> will<00:02:47.570> have<00:02:47.750> a<00:02:47.810> very
