ignition is a TV set bonus from gear PDP
gear<00:00:40.460> what<00:00:41.120> does<00:00:41.360> is<00:00:41.570> it<00:00:41.720> increases<00:00:42.170> the<00:00:42.380> crit

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:43.220 
gear what does is it increases the crit

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.100 
gear what does is it increases the crit
chance<00:00:43.250> by<00:00:43.700> fifty<00:00:43.969> percent<00:00:44.120> and<00:00:44.510> increases

as well so as they get through sex with
nishan<00:00:50.329> they<00:00:50.870> became<00:00:51.079> casting<00:00:51.379> fireball

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
nishan they became casting fireball

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.560 
nishan they became casting fireball
which<00:00:51.890> is<00:00:52.010> a<00:00:52.160> guaranteed<00:00:52.579> good<00:00:53.270> chance

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
go for the Seas chain and they just go

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.990 
go for the Seas chain and they just go
really<00:01:33.140> nuts<00:01:33.470> on<00:01:33.679> the<00:01:33.709> target<00:01:33.950> and<00:01:34.280> there<00:01:34.880> is<00:01:34.970> a

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
really nuts on the target and there is a

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.760 
really nuts on the target and there is a
way<00:01:35.209> that<00:01:35.599> fire<00:01:35.929> mages<00:01:36.140> maximize<00:01:36.590> their

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
way that fire mages maximize their

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.859 
way that fire mages maximize their
damage<00:01:37.099> so<00:01:37.550> do<00:01:37.849> the<00:01:38.060> maximum<00:01:38.390> damage<00:01:38.539> as<00:01:38.840> a

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
damage so do the maximum damage as a

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.199 
damage so do the maximum damage as a
farm<00:01:39.170> age<00:01:39.319> you<00:01:39.920> should<00:01:40.099> really<00:01:40.310> consider<00:01:40.819> your

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:54.279 
way it works is it takes in the direct
damage<00:01:52.580> any<00:01:53.060> spell<00:01:53.420> and<00:01:53.810> converts<00:01:54.140> it<00:01:54.229> to

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:54.289 
damage any spell and converts it to

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:56.320 
damage any spell and converts it to
damage<00:01:54.619> over<00:01:54.770> time<00:01:54.830> the<00:01:55.729> more<00:01:55.910> damage<00:01:56.090> is

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
damage over time the more damage is

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.839 
damage over time the more damage is
added<00:01:56.720> and<00:01:56.840> thrown<00:01:57.140> the<00:01:57.679> more<00:01:57.920> damage<00:01:58.429> it<00:01:58.729> will

00:01:58.839 --> 00:01:58.849 
added and thrown the more damage it will

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:02.559 
added and thrown the more damage it will
take<00:01:59.060> in<00:01:59.330> and<00:01:59.509> add<00:02:00.020> to<00:02:00.830> do<00:02:00.950> more<00:02:01.160> damage<00:02:01.509> ok<00:02:02.509> so

00:02:02.559 --> 00:02:02.569 
take in and add to do more damage ok so

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:04.640 
take in and add to do more damage ok so
I'll<00:02:03.319> clear<00:02:03.679> it<00:02:03.709> up

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
I'll clear it up

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.800 
I'll clear it up
let<00:02:05.130> me<00:02:05.250> start<00:02:05.430> with<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.550> rotation<00:02:06.060> that<00:02:06.210> will

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
let me start with the rotation that will

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.740 
let me start with the rotation that will
help<00:02:07.020> maximize<00:02:07.710> DeKnight<00:02:08.070> the<00:02:09.060> mage<00:02:09.240> usually

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
help maximize DeKnight the mage usually

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.380 
help maximize DeKnight the mage usually
start<00:02:09.990> up<00:02:10.140> with<00:02:10.710> a<00:02:10.740> meteor<00:02:11.310> on<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.820> target<00:02:12.030> a

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
start up with a meteor on the target a

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.150 
start up with a meteor on the target a
nice<00:02:12.720> way<00:02:12.960> is<00:02:13.140> to<00:02:13.320> route<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.560> target<00:02:14.010> before

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
nice way is to route the target before

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.520 
nice way is to route the target before
the<00:02:14.370> meteor<00:02:14.580> so<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.570> meteor<00:02:15.870> is<00:02:16.020> delayed<00:02:16.290> 30

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
the meteor so the meteor is delayed 30

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.070 
the meteor so the meteor is delayed 30
seconds<00:02:16.860> during<00:02:17.730> those<00:02:17.850> three<00:02:18.030> seconds<00:02:18.360> image

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
seconds during those three seconds image

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.250 
seconds during those three seconds image
gases<00:02:19.620> fireball<00:02:20.090> into<00:02:21.090> a<00:02:21.120> power<00:02:21.390> blast<00:02:21.630> the

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
gases fireball into a power blast the

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.410 
gases fireball into a power blast the
mage<00:02:22.470> gets<00:02:22.800> another<00:02:22.980> pyroblast<00:02:23.430> so<00:02:24.060> all<00:02:24.210> these

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
mage gets another pyroblast so all these

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.660 
mage gets another pyroblast so all these
are<00:02:24.480> stacked<00:02:24.960> together<00:02:25.110> into<00:02:26.010> a<00:02:26.040> big<00:02:26.370> fat

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
are stacked together into a big fat

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.840 
are stacked together into a big fat
ignite<00:02:27.180> all<00:02:28.020> are<00:02:28.350> added<00:02:28.770> as<00:02:28.950> damage<00:02:29.610> over<00:02:29.820> time

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
ignite all are added as damage over time

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.090 
ignite all are added as damage over time
all<00:02:30.180> together<00:02:30.360> a<00:02:30.690> nice<00:02:30.930> way<00:02:31.140> to<00:02:31.200> stay<00:02:31.470> aware<00:02:31.800> of

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
all together a nice way to stay aware of

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.210 
all together a nice way to stay aware of
your<00:02:32.580> ignite<00:02:32.970> is<00:02:33.600> to<00:02:33.840> use<00:02:34.440> an<00:02:34.650> add-on<00:02:34.860> called

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
your ignite is to use an add-on called

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.300 
your ignite is to use an add-on called
my<00:02:35.430> big<00:02:35.670> ignite<00:02:36.030> it<00:02:36.750> only<00:02:36.990> checks<00:02:37.260> your<00:02:37.500> egnyte

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
my big ignite it only checks your egnyte

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.640 
my big ignite it only checks your egnyte
how<00:02:38.730> much<00:02:38.910> it<00:02:39.030> is<00:02:39.120> ticking<00:02:39.510> and<00:02:39.660> you'll

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
how much it is ticking and you'll

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.980 
how much it is ticking and you'll
actually<00:02:40.860> see<00:02:41.220> if<00:02:41.459> combusting<00:02:42.450> is<00:02:42.570> worth<00:02:42.840> it

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
actually see if combusting is worth it

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.920 
actually see if combusting is worth it
or<00:02:43.110> not<00:02:43.320> mages<00:02:44.220> are<00:02:44.340> like<00:02:44.490> gamblers<00:02:44.880> you<00:02:45.810> know

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930

ignite you decided to Inferno blast
you'll<00:02:53.520> lose<00:02:53.820> a<00:02:53.850> lot<00:02:54.240> of<00:02:54.420> damage<00:02:54.630> just<00:02:55.590> to<00:02:55.709> get

you'll lose a lot of damage just to get
another<00:02:56.130> power<00:02:56.340> best<00:02:56.550> buy<00:02:56.940> in<00:02:57.060> filming<00:02:57.390> blast

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
another power best buy in filming blast

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.330 
another power best buy in filming blast
you<00:02:57.930> will<00:02:58.050> lose<00:02:58.200> a<00:02:58.230> lot<00:02:58.440> of<00:02:58.470> the<00:02:58.680> ignite<00:02:58.980> damage

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
you will lose a lot of the ignite damage

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.030 
you will lose a lot of the ignite damage
and<00:02:59.520> combustion<00:03:00.480> won't<00:03:00.750> do<00:03:00.870> a<00:03:00.900> lot<00:03:01.140> so<00:03:01.980> you

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
and combustion won't do a lot so you

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.680 
and combustion won't do a lot so you
should<00:03:02.400> have<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.730> inferno<00:03:03.090> blast<00:03:03.330> ready

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
should have the inferno blast ready

blasts<00:03:08.130> and<00:03:08.280> the<00:03:08.430> meteor<00:03:08.810> so<00:03:09.810> keep<00:03:09.989> the

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
blasts and the meteor so keep the

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.080 
blasts and the meteor so keep the
rotation<00:03:10.410> like<00:03:10.560> it<00:03:10.709> was<00:03:10.980> and<00:03:11.190> don't<00:03:11.640> risk<00:03:11.880> it

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
rotation like it was and don't risk it

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.509
