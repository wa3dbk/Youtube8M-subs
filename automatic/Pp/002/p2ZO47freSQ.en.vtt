00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.069
 well we enter so you wanted dobbs waiting for us to attack the batteries 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.640
 all this by a transfer of the vintage which is nice Saturday special cbk with 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:15.179
 France ditto to pass this course 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.409
 the INSEE published 

00:00:18.409 --> 00:00:21.549
 a delegation will be received by that does not have much renÃ© dumont for 

00:00:21.549 --> 00:00:24.549
 put a lot more complete very special office 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.300
 however the site does not have 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.860
 cut the bottoms of the gulf of mexico but 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.070
 you see I am Quebecois for the selection of the academy as well as 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.070
 can do about a minute more with optimum 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.200
 about funds from Pakistan 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.820
 so the special versions and jean-baptiste blondeau solar are not 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.270
 not so special that it actually 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.230
 no longer dismissed that of magic cards 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.880
 which means that we can massively produce lists of 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.940
 daycares are prime examples 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.770
 because we do not expect it 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.150
 the second is less and less but they are also lucky to have a 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.480
 problem how is it possible 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.290
 although success is otherwise unlikely 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.290
 for the third goal it is that little success 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.250
 indifferent general had been held throughout his life scrolling all 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.120
 immediately in the neighborhood 10 I'm for nothing that's how these products 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.750
 at first it was so for magic cards 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.730
 special edgar of his special because they are white 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.730
 they have in any case for my life forever the carte blanche 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:25.860
 so, it's all right 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.410
 as long as we do not have the cards in stock shares not to take a 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.590
 map shown as well special contact 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:31.900
 there it is 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.870
 why not that's why 3 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.460
 it shows particularly well 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.520
 we can remake like that it is useless 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.520
 but on the other hand it's possible simple 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.540
 it's instantaneous 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.630
 not simple so 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:48.980
 we can not do it 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.420
 this leads them filing for bankruptcy or know it to perfect the work to be done 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.170
 we can pretend not completely alas 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.420
 it works great 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.420
 the 42 year old man works and the limit even like that 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.110
 it works also admit that these ladies 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.050
 not its content
