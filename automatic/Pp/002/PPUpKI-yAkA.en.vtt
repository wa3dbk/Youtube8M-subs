these<00:03:33.700> two<00:03:34.090> image<00:03:34.510> sizes<00:03:35.110> basically<00:03:35.350> the<00:03:36.250> LWR

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
these two image sizes basically the LWR

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.559 
these two image sizes basically the LWR
SW<00:03:37.630> and<00:03:37.840> of<00:03:38.620> course<00:03:38.920> the<00:03:39.700> larger<00:03:40.180> ones<00:03:40.390> gonna

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:40.569 
SW and of course the larger ones gonna

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:42.510 
SW and of course the larger ones gonna
result<00:03:40.810> in<00:03:40.959> a<00:03:41.080> higher<00:03:41.230> quality<00:03:41.650> image<00:03:41.980> but

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.520 
result in a higher quality image but

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.220 
result in a higher quality image but
give<00:03:42.730> you<00:03:42.819> much<00:03:43.090> less<00:03:43.300> images<00:03:43.870> on<00:03:44.020> the<00:03:44.140> screen

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
give you much less images on the screen

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:45.750 
give you much less images on the screen
reminder<00:03:44.800> you<00:03:45.010> know<00:03:45.130> you<00:03:45.190> can<00:03:45.430> think<00:03:45.610> of<00:03:45.700> it

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
reminder you know you can think of it

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.280 
reminder you know you can think of it
this<00:03:45.850> way<00:03:46.000> when<00:03:46.780> you're<00:03:46.870> at<00:03:47.020> the<00:03:47.110> lower

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
this way when you're at the lower

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.680 
this way when you're at the lower
resolution<00:03:47.890> image<00:03:48.430> to<00:03:48.580> go<00:03:48.700> to<00:03:48.760> this<00:03:48.970> one<00:03:49.510> right

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
resolution image to go to this one right

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.170 
resolution image to go to this one right
here<00:03:50.110> that<00:03:50.740> is<00:03:50.950> more<00:03:51.220> than<00:03:51.400> twice<00:03:51.940> the

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
here that is more than twice the

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.420 
here that is more than twice the
resolution<00:03:52.330> it<00:03:53.020> takes<00:03:53.470> almost<00:03:53.740> four<00:03:54.250> times

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
resolution it takes almost four times

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.820 
resolution it takes almost four times
the<00:03:54.760> data<00:03:55.000> on<00:03:55.840> the<00:03:55.930> card<00:03:56.200> so<00:03:56.349> you<00:03:56.440> can<00:03:56.500> see<00:03:56.680> that

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
the data on the card so you can see that

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.710 
the data on the card so you can see that
the<00:03:56.980> amount<00:03:57.250> image<00:03:57.550> images<00:03:58.000> you<00:03:58.120> can<00:03:58.240> take

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
the amount image images you can take

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.370 
the amount image images you can take
goes<00:03:58.959> down<00:03:59.170> from<00:03:59.410> 2500<00:04:00.280> almost<00:04:00.640> to<00:04:01.060> 500<00:04:01.780> in<00:04:01.930> the

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
goes down from 2500 almost to 500 in the

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.610 
goes down from 2500 almost to 500 in the
much<00:04:02.650> larger<00:04:03.540> resolution<00:04:04.540> size<00:04:04.810> but<00:04:05.470> then

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
much larger resolution size but then

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.770 
much larger resolution size but then
again<00:04:05.740> if<00:04:06.250> you've<00:04:06.430> got<00:04:06.459> a<00:04:06.640> large<00:04:06.880> card<00:04:07.209> usually

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
again if you've got a large card usually

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.930 
again if you've got a large card usually
500<00:04:08.470> pictures<00:04:08.620> of<00:04:08.830> you<00:04:08.980> enough<00:04:09.430> card<00:04:09.730> enough

out<00:04:34.030> and<00:04:34.300> you<00:04:34.419> do<00:04:34.539> a<00:04:34.569> formatting<00:04:35.050> of<00:04:35.110> the<00:04:35.199> car

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
out and you do a formatting of the car

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.350 
out and you do a formatting of the car
to<00:04:35.500> put<00:04:35.620> a<00:04:35.650> new<00:04:35.830> card<00:04:36.099> in<00:04:36.250> it<00:04:36.430> will<00:04:36.819> reset<00:04:37.150> the

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
to put a new card in it will reset the

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.799 
to put a new card in it will reset the
file<00:04:37.840> number<00:04:38.439> images<00:04:39.219> on<00:04:39.370> the<00:04:39.729> images<00:04:40.059> to<00:04:40.300> zero

00:04:40.799 --> 00:04:40.809 
file number images on the images to zero

00:04:40.809 --> 00:04:43.019 
file number images on the images to zero
such<00:04:41.439> that<00:04:41.469> it<00:04:42.129> numbers<00:04:42.550> each<00:04:42.759> of<00:04:42.909> them

00:04:43.019 --> 00:04:43.029 
such that it numbers each of them

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:44.279 
such that it numbers each of them
sequentially<00:04:43.689> on<00:04:43.719> the<00:04:43.900> card

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:44.289 
sequentially on the card

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:47.010 
sequentially on the card
I<00:04:44.759> prefer<00:04:45.759> continuous<00:04:46.419> because<00:04:46.599> I'd<00:04:46.840> like<00:04:46.960> to

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
I prefer continuous because I'd like to

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.879 
I prefer continuous because I'd like to
know<00:04:47.199> how<00:04:47.439> many

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:47.889 
know how many

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:50.939 
know how many
I've<00:04:48.189> taken<00:04:48.430> overall<00:04:49.090> with<00:04:49.870> the<00:04:50.139> unit<00:04:50.830> with<00:04:50.919> a

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:50.949 
I've taken overall with the unit with a

camera<00:04:51.310> with<00:04:51.430> a<00:04:51.490> cannon<00:04:51.819> so<00:04:51.870> this<00:04:52.870> way<00:04:53.110> the

00:04:53.429 --> 00:04:53.439 
camera with a cannon so this way the

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:54.990 
camera with a cannon so this way the
numbers<00:04:53.889> will<00:04:54.039> continue<00:04:54.159> to<00:04:54.639> increment

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
numbers will continue to increment

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.909 
numbers will continue to increment
throughout<00:04:55.780> the<00:04:56.080> time<00:04:56.289> you<00:04:56.409> take<00:04:56.590> pictures

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
thing about Union continuous is later

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.850 
thing about Union continuous is later
