00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 Marshall in mind 

00:00:10.439 --> 00:00:12.299
 therefore 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:16.539
 Class of the Realschule lazy spells league with the dictatorship of the supporters 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:17.630
 retail 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.849
 given the penalty but no matter but with one 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:24.029
 Volly Tanner I can not cash it 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.489
 Here we are in the face of the biggest economic crisis of all time 

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:30.349
 and on Christmas Eve people do not come to their living room because of the 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:32.660
 are fully grafted to the ceiling 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.650
 want and believe it is the basis of all the garbage is still packed and 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:37.430
 tied 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.050
 although everyone knows exactly what's in it 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.359
 Whole forests were then changed again 

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:46.089
 as the teens maintain the packaging illusion it is about 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:49.979
 any successful surprises have been children 

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:52.069
 at night almost ten percent 

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:53.589
 and I can only say something 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:56.349
 completely overpriced consumer electronics the 

00:00:56.349 --> 00:00:58.739
 Moment is obsolete where he unpacks them 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.410
 The Chinese demand factories made what they want says 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:03.949
 that is so brimming 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:05.799
 with carcinogenic chemicals 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:08.579
 that resulted in the disc being declared a hazardous waste dump 

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:09.070
 should 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.210
 and of course, panties painfully stylish 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.980
 and care high 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.460
 the original bus tours 4 Dario were taken care of 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.020
 not to mention all the weapons 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.049
 the underworld and the cathartic real bombs 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:29.899
 Any employment are signaling this way 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:32.329
 which is another year in this field 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:33.360
 and of course 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.359
 Vouchers 

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:37.530
 Massage coupons and Chelsea's manicures 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.830
 Vouchers important for us in this year's special kind 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:41.689
 Vouchers 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:43.850
 for themselves the animals 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.630
 the 27 euro rich blog always for all elections 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.479
 then he has been denied quite different classes 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.410
 Werl 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.410
 this could 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.450
 Höwedes bite again into the Nordmann fir when I see how 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.210
 this supposedly so high because of their Christmas 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.880
 occurs completely 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.920
 his name is street 8 his gifts exchange 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.450
 his three-day one-on-one throws us a stop 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.940
 This year this year we do everything was very different 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.789
 and what makes her Vileda even better 

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:19.310
 And everyone knows that 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.830
 that the whole thing is a mess and Rashad Wright just one of consumption 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.530
 Terrorist controlled perversion of the original Christmas message is 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.010
 As they say 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.629
 in one of these pious songs 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:33.310
 the tunes of the investors, this path is going to the last detail 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.769
 and their text no human anymore money style 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:38.220
 Shields 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.829
 Schiel 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:41.380
 now his game is drawing 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:42.879
 Ashton wants 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:45.780
 and if you see here we know which is unfortunately Ewald 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.620
 We want to stop learning at that time is just for me 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.529
 I did not want sleep 

00:02:51.529 --> 00:02:53.939
 but I need 

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:56.040
 The quarter was similar 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.099
 without the brew 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:59.290
 Oil the barker and garbage seller 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.879
 without the nagging she is foreseen 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:05.870
 Without any prior it was recently the world and most of all 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.770
 and I can not say that 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.380
 and the false promises 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:10.990
 the political leader 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.329
 all just for a few days 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:14.950
 dive in and 2 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:15.780
 Urs Lehmann 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.569
 and participated say a word 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:20.599
 and the only thing holding everyone 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:21.799
 I see this 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:22.650
 even 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.199
 the Christmas speech of the Federal President 

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:28.459
 is this time under the motto 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:30.469
 br 

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:31.969
 because that's it 

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:34.969
 That would be the Federal President 

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:40.199
 the President also spent five minutes taking the word back to his 

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.969
 writing desk 

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:42.609
 and say an old word 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:45.520
 Point just so speechless in the camera 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.820
 and since his people that too him 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.049
 nothing more and van Gaal 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:51.599
 if one for a moment 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:53.549
 complete silence has come 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.989
 there we all make a Christmas match Silence fits 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:00.509
 then we calmly think of misery in formal terms 

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:01.669
 in this world 

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:02.819
 Questions 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:04.449
 with climate change 

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:06.579
 with the melting of the polar caps 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:08.769
 the rising sea level 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.379
 the never-ending and the region 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:16.079
 think of the barren soil as the scarcity of drinking water 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.449
 Are ministerial 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:19.849
 and where you have disasters and then 

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:22.099
 we just entered 

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:25.699
 back to the idea of ​​their public finances 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:26.970
 Disaster of around 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.039
 Countries and municipalities 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:30.849
 nobody says anything 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:33.229
 just a quiet corner 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:34.779
 the pension funds 

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:37.479
 a poverty of old people and care emergency 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:40.150
 a superstart backup systems 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.219
 to the fate of the millions of children 

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:46.169
 in this country under the poverty line life 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:48.419
 I close in the third world 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:51.219
 These do not even have the following scenario 

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:53.039
 the left hold on ours 

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:53.780
 Martin and St 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.240
 Mary and St 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.980
 the abuse of the military 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.720
 and most importantly, they will come from the political leaders and see them 

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:10.490
 so they remember 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.939
 the growth acceleration law 

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:16.270
 make a consultation come true and the Nobel Peace Prize 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:19.879
 we have many probably SV the capitation 

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:22.780
 May in Berlin and Vienna in the two groups 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.789
 Hagen ots - a life where others 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:27.249
 and then he stops 

00:05:27.249 --> 00:05:28.669
 and to Iran 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:31.779
 and one day it was the border areas 

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:33.279
 Gaddafi 

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:35.169
 No bin Laden 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:37.849
 and this though 

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:39.999
 and who then as the first non-brite increase 

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:42.919

 we have 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.770
 pairs 

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:06.259
