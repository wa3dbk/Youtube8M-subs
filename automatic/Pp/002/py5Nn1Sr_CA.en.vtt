the same quality of work which you did
for<00:00:38.430> chandrayaan-1<00:00:39.079> yeah<00:00:40.079> I<00:00:40.110> think<00:00:40.469> I<00:00:40.530> can

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
for chandrayaan-1 yeah I think I can

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.750 
for chandrayaan-1 yeah I think I can
tell<00:00:40.800> we<00:00:40.950> have<00:00:40.980> graduated<00:00:41.640> from

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
tell we have graduated from

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.459 
tell we have graduated from
chandrayaan-1<00:00:42.270> because<00:00:42.840> all<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.140> lessons

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
chandrayaan-1 because all the lessons

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.290 
chandrayaan-1 because all the lessons
learnt<00:00:43.739> from<00:00:43.829> chandrayaan-1<00:00:44.399> has<00:00:44.820> been<00:00:45.059> very

finding of water on the moon what is the

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.380 
finding of water on the moon what is the
big<00:01:42.540> single<00:01:43.110> big<00:01:43.320> exciting<00:01:43.770> find<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.759> expect

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
big single big exciting find you expect

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.260 
big single big exciting find you expect
if<00:01:45.570> at<00:01:45.840> all<00:01:45.990> from<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.619> Mars<00:01:46.890> mission<00:01:47.280> yeah<00:01:48.090> if

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
if at all from the Mars mission yeah if

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.690 
if at all from the Mars mission yeah if
you<00:01:48.479> look<00:01:48.630> at<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.899> parallelism<00:01:49.350> between

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
you look at the parallelism between

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.069 
you look at the parallelism between
water<00:01:50.700> on<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.119> moon<00:01:51.149> over<00:01:51.450> Chandra<00:01:51.810> unknown

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
water on the moon over Chandra unknown

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.260 
water on the moon over Chandra unknown
versus<00:01:52.380> now<00:01:52.590> here<00:01:52.860> probably<00:01:53.790> water<00:01:53.939> under

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
versus now here probably water under

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.240 
versus now here probably water under
Mars<00:01:54.479> has<00:01:54.689> been<00:01:54.720> probably<00:01:55.470> unambiguously<00:01:56.070> has

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
Mars has been probably unambiguously has

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.429 
Mars has been probably unambiguously has
seen<00:01:56.490> that<00:01:56.640> but<00:01:56.820> we<00:01:56.909> are<00:01:56.939> talking<00:01:57.119> about

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
seen that but we are talking about

00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:59.330 
seen that but we are talking about
possibility<00:01:58.439> of<00:01:58.590> methane

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
possibility of methane

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.910 
possibility of methane
whether<00:01:59.880> it<00:02:00.030> is<00:02:00.149> there<00:02:00.329> or<00:02:00.479> not<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:01.320> I'm<00:02:01.560> an

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
whether it is there or not and I'm an

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.319 
whether it is there or not and I'm an
ambiguously<00:02:02.340> is<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.549> possibility<00:02:02.969> answer

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
ambiguously is it possibility answer

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.910 
ambiguously is it possibility answer
because<00:02:03.780> our<00:02:03.930> meeting<00:02:04.290> sensor<00:02:04.649> we<00:02:04.770> were<00:02:04.829> able

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
because our meeting sensor we were able

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.160 
because our meeting sensor we were able
to<00:02:05.130> see<00:02:05.280> globally<00:02:05.729> look<00:02:05.880> at<00:02:06.060> endeavor<00:02:06.750> as<00:02:06.990> well

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
to see globally look at endeavor as well

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.900 
to see globally look at endeavor as well
as<00:02:07.290> our<00:02:07.439> orbit<00:02:07.799> is<00:02:07.950> in<00:02:08.160> much<00:02:08.550> better<00:02:08.729> way

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
as our orbit is in much better way

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.750 
as our orbit is in much better way
looking<00:02:09.810> for<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.349> both<00:02:10.560> global<00:02:11.190> look<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:11.610> as

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
looking for the both global look and as

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.100 
looking for the both global look and as
well<00:02:11.879> as<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.000> closer<00:02:12.270> look<00:02:12.540> possible<00:02:12.989> with

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
well as a closer look possible with

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.550 
well as a closer look possible with
using

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
using

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.920 
using
ten<00:02:13.739> sensor<00:02:14.069> probably<00:02:14.849> will<00:02:14.970> able<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.209> answer

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
ten sensor probably will able to answer

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.170 
ten sensor probably will able to answer
this<00:02:16.110> question<00:02:16.380> of<00:02:16.739> whether<00:02:17.400> methane<00:02:18.030> is

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
this question of whether methane is

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.100 
this question of whether methane is
there<00:02:18.390> or<00:02:18.599> not

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
there or not

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.430 
there or not
now<00:02:19.709> if<00:02:20.370> I<00:02:20.580> remember<00:02:20.940> correctly<00:02:21.390> you<00:02:21.720> found

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
now if I remember correctly you found

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.570 
now if I remember correctly you found
water<00:02:22.739> on<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.130> moon<00:02:23.400> in<00:02:23.670> 2009<00:02:24.920> is<00:02:25.920> it<00:02:26.190> correct

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
water on the moon in 2009 is it correct

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.870 
water on the moon in 2009 is it correct
that<00:02:26.700> in<00:02:27.480> your<00:02:27.750> own<00:02:28.020> home<00:02:28.260> village<00:02:28.860> you<00:02:29.520> found

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
that in your own home village you found

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.850 
that in your own home village you found
water<00:02:30.150> much<00:02:30.480> later<00:02:30.810> can<00:02:31.230> you<00:02:31.260> recount<00:02:31.680> that

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
water much later can you recount that

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.100 
water much later can you recount that
little<00:02:32.250> story<00:02:32.519> for<00:02:32.730> me<00:02:32.910> yeah<00:02:33.660> it's<00:02:33.870> really

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
little story for me yeah it's really

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.350 
little story for me yeah it's really
really<00:02:34.290> good<00:02:35.010> I<00:02:35.430> think<00:02:35.640> what<00:02:35.940> happened

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
really good I think what happened

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.650 
really good I think what happened
looking<00:02:37.140> back<00:02:37.319> yes<00:02:37.920> I<00:02:38.340> could<00:02:38.910> I<00:02:38.940> can<00:02:39.390> tell<00:02:39.540> you

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
looking back yes I could I can tell you

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.839 
looking back yes I could I can tell you
water<00:02:40.019> finding<00:02:40.500> underwater<00:02:40.890> and<00:02:41.130> the<00:02:41.250> moon<00:02:41.430> is

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
water finding underwater and the moon is

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.180 
water finding underwater and the moon is
a<00:02:41.910> discovery<00:02:42.330> say<00:02:42.630> one<00:02:42.810> one<00:02:43.349> side<00:02:43.620> is<00:02:43.769> a<00:02:43.890> happy

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
a discovery say one one side is a happy

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.580 
a discovery say one one side is a happy
but<00:02:44.640> equally<00:02:45.000> I<00:02:45.090> had<00:02:45.330> a<00:02:45.360> happy<00:02:45.540> I<00:02:45.690> found<00:02:46.200> happy

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
but equally I had a happy I found happy

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.460 
but equally I had a happy I found happy
when<00:02:47.250> we<00:02:47.400> found<00:02:47.610> water<00:02:47.819> on<00:02:48.180> our<00:02:48.510> village<00:02:49.260> Co

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
when we found water on our village Co

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.460 
when we found water on our village Co
the<00:02:49.530> body<00:02:49.739> very<00:02:50.370> recently<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:51.239> then<00:02:51.930> recently

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
the body very recently and then recently

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.949 
the body very recently and then recently
means<00:02:52.799> when<00:02:53.040> this<00:02:53.280> year<00:02:53.489> it's<00:02:54.239> a<00:02:54.450> this<00:02:54.690> year<00:02:54.930> I

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
means when this year it's a this year I

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.289 
means when this year it's a this year I
think<00:02:55.230> a<00:02:55.319> couple<00:02:55.500> of<00:02:55.650> weeks<00:02:55.980> from<00:02:56.910> now<00:02:57.030> I<00:02:57.180> think

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
think a couple of weeks from now I think

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:00.620 
think a couple of weeks from now I think
we<00:02:57.540> have<00:02:57.630> water<00:02:58.019> and<00:02:58.640> nearly<00:02:59.640> ten<00:02:59.910> fifty<00:03:00.209> we're

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
we have water and nearly ten fifty we're

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.509 
we have water and nearly ten fifty we're
just<00:03:00.810> down<00:03:01.019> we<00:03:01.230> have<00:03:01.319> seen<00:03:01.530> the<00:03:01.620> water<00:03:01.739> and<00:03:02.340> it

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
just down we have seen the water and it

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.030 
just down we have seen the water and it
was<00:03:02.610> really<00:03:02.910> really<00:03:03.390> a<00:03:03.540> good<00:03:04.260> thing<00:03:04.319> for<00:03:04.769> our

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
was really really a good thing for our

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.309 
was really really a good thing for our
own<00:03:05.250> people<00:03:05.549> there<00:03:05.730> for<00:03:06.150> my<00:03:06.330> own<00:03:06.450> family<00:03:06.660> less

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
own people there for my own family less

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.410 
own people there for my own family less
well<00:03:07.470> as<00:03:07.590> per<00:03:07.739> be<00:03:07.860> is<00:03:07.950> concerned<00:03:08.370> meaning<00:03:09.120> you

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
well as per be is concerned meaning you

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.970 
well as per be is concerned meaning you
found<00:03:09.750> water<00:03:10.049> on<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.500> moon<00:03:10.739> which<00:03:10.950> is

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
found water on the moon which is

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.390 
found water on the moon which is
considered<00:03:11.549> parched<00:03:12.060> in<00:03:12.299> 2009<00:03:13.230> and<00:03:13.530> in<00:03:14.250> the

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
considered parched in 2009 and in the

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.160 
considered parched in 2009 and in the
village<00:03:14.700> where<00:03:14.910> you<00:03:15.030> grow<00:03:15.360> up<00:03:15.390> and<00:03:15.720> you<00:03:15.810> study

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
village where you grow up and you study

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.400 
village where you grow up and you study
you<00:03:16.890> have<00:03:17.010> found<00:03:17.220> water<00:03:17.489> only<00:03:17.880> in<00:03:18.239> 2013<00:03:19.200> is

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
you have found water only in 2013 is

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.199 
you have found water only in 2013 is
that<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:19.829> correct<00:03:20.040> interpretation<00:03:20.430> no

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
that the correct interpretation no

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:22.849 
that the correct interpretation no
correct<00:03:21.630> interpretation<00:03:21.900> you<00:03:22.290> basically<00:03:22.739> we

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
correct interpretation you basically we

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:24.259 
correct interpretation you basically we
heard<00:03:23.010> about<00:03:23.130> what<00:03:23.400> is<00:03:23.549> not<00:03:23.730> being<00:03:23.910> questioned

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
heard about what is not being questioned

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.090 
heard about what is not being questioned
of<00:03:24.359> water<00:03:24.540> not<00:03:24.750> being<00:03:25.109> there<00:03:25.320> in<00:03:25.440> our<00:03:25.560> village

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
of water not being there in our village

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.800 
of water not being there in our village

able to do we will be able to change
that<00:06:18.789> here<00:06:19.060> and<00:06:19.270> the<00:06:19.569> first<00:06:19.750> words<00:06:20.110> that

that here and the first words that

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:22.409 
that here and the first words that
responsibilities<00:06:21.430> and<00:06:21.789> although<00:06:22.149> were

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:22.419

00:06:24.179 --> 00:06:24.189 
considerations to be put together I

00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:25.529 
considerations to be put together I
think<00:06:24.460> that's<00:06:24.580> what<00:06:24.729> we<00:06:24.849> are<00:06:24.879> done<00:06:25.060> here

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:25.539 
think that's what we are done here

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:28.320 
think that's what we are done here
so<00:06:26.379> that<00:06:26.589> was<00:06:26.740> another<00:06:26.949> a<00:06:27.219> telling<00:06:27.580> us<00:06:27.729> that
