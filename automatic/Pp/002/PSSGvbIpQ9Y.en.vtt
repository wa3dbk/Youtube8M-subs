because I'm a everyone he told me quite

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.960 
because I'm a everyone he told me quite
a<00:02:46.370> while<00:02:46.489> ago<00:02:46.790> that<00:02:47.239> he<00:02:47.870> was<00:02:48.110> going<00:02:48.470> to<00:02:48.970> make

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
a while ago that he was going to make

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.539 
a while ago that he was going to make
his<00:02:50.209> first<00:02:50.450> commissioned<00:02:50.989> piece<00:02:51.260> a<00:02:51.590> Batman

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
his first commissioned piece a Batman

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:56.460 
his first commissioned piece a Batman
and<00:02:53.260> he<00:02:54.260> just<00:02:54.500> knows<00:02:54.680> how<00:02:55.010> much<00:02:55.220> I<00:02:55.430> love<00:02:55.610> Batman

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
and he just knows how much I love Batman

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.539 
and he just knows how much I love Batman
so<00:02:58.269> I<00:02:59.500> think<00:03:00.500> I<00:03:00.860> was<00:03:00.950> one<00:03:01.100> of<00:03:01.250> the<00:03:01.340> first

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
so I think I was one of the first

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:04.240 
so I think I was one of the first
persons<00:03:02.120> to<00:03:02.660> know<00:03:02.870> that's<00:03:03.110> why<00:03:03.350> I<00:03:03.380> got<00:03:03.650> such<00:03:03.920> a

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
persons to know that's why I got such a

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.460 
persons to know that's why I got such a
low<00:03:04.910> number<00:03:05.120> so<00:03:05.480> I'm<00:03:05.540> really<00:03:05.930> happy<00:03:06.320> about

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
low number so I'm really happy about

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.840 
low number so I'm really happy about
that<00:03:06.739> so<00:03:08.320> hopefully<00:03:09.320> there'll<00:03:09.739> be<00:03:09.799> no<00:03:10.100> you

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
that so hopefully there'll be no you

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.910 
that so hopefully there'll be no you
know<00:03:11.000> dodgy<00:03:11.450> casting<00:03:12.019> of<00:03:12.140> this<00:03:12.380> because<00:03:12.739> if

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
know dodgy casting of this because if

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.890 
know dodgy casting of this because if
you<00:03:13.010> do<00:03:13.190> get<00:03:13.400> a<00:03:13.430> dodgy<00:03:13.850> casting<00:03:14.329> you<00:03:14.420> probably

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
you do get a dodgy casting you probably

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.479 
you do get a dodgy casting you probably
won't<00:03:15.200> get<00:03:15.350> the<00:03:15.560> certificate<00:03:16.459> of
