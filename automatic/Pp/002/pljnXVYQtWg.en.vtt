Vulcan ket gospel of getting gummy worms
into<00:00:29.789> your<00:00:29.939> mouth<00:00:30.150> so<00:00:30.929> next<00:00:31.500> work<00:00:31.800> on<00:00:31.980> some

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
into your mouth so next work on some

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.700 
into your mouth so next work on some
variations<00:00:32.850> here<00:00:33.180> for<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.989> ladies<00:00:34.320> we<00:00:34.350> have

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
variations here for the ladies we have

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.400 
variations here for the ladies we have
the<00:00:34.890> back<00:00:35.040> meant<00:00:35.280> by<00:00:35.399> saw<00:00:35.610> variation

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.630 

technically<00:00:40.410> involved<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:40.980> works<00:00:41.190> better<00:00:41.460> if

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
technically involved it works better if

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.940 
technically involved it works better if
it<00:00:41.760> goes<00:00:41.879> in<00:00:42.030> reverse<00:00:42.149> so<00:00:42.450> you<00:00:42.600> can<00:00:42.770> plant<00:00:43.770> it

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
it goes in reverse so you can plant it

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.830 
it goes in reverse so you can plant it
and<00:00:44.520> you<00:00:44.640> now<00:00:44.789> see<00:00:44.820> like<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:45.450> cuz<00:00:45.629> if<00:00:45.719> it's

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
and you now see like that cuz if it's

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.029 
and you now see like that cuz if it's
going<00:00:46.020> forward<00:00:46.350> you<00:00:46.440> can't<00:00:46.649> really<00:00:46.770> do<00:00:46.890> unless

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
going forward you can't really do unless

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.090 
going forward you can't really do unless
you're<00:00:47.250> going<00:00:47.370> downward<00:00:48.059> follow<00:00:48.539> with<00:00:48.719> me

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
you're going downward follow with me

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.580 
you're going downward follow with me
downwards<00:00:50.660> and<00:00:51.660> that's<00:00:51.870> how<00:00:52.079> you<00:00:52.140> get<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.440> from

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
downwards and that's how you get it from

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.959 
downwards and that's how you get it from
there<00:00:52.710> so<00:00:52.949> if<00:00:53.309> we're<00:00:53.520> gonna<00:00:53.610> be<00:00:53.699> going<00:00:53.879> for

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
there so if we're gonna be going for

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.130 
there so if we're gonna be going for
that<00:00:54.030> backing<00:00:54.360> but<00:00:54.480> I<00:00:54.629> remember<00:00:54.989> going

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
that backing but I remember going

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.350 
that backing but I remember going
reverse<00:00:55.370> never<00:00:56.370> coming<00:00:56.699> backwards<00:00:56.850> yeah

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
reverse never coming backwards yeah

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.500 
reverse never coming backwards yeah
plant<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:58.469> ah<00:00:58.649> right<00:00:59.340> in<00:00:59.520> meiosis<00:00:59.910> we're<00:01:00.390> going

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
plant it ah right in meiosis we're going

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.639 
plant it ah right in meiosis we're going
to<00:01:00.570> go<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.690> from<00:01:00.899> something<00:01:01.170> else<00:01:01.260> your<00:01:01.530> this
