00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
straight away I connected it to the

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.400 
straight away I connected it to the

should<00:00:43.140> be<00:00:43.340> given<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.960> connect<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.110> itune

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
should be given a connect to itune

assemble<00:00:47.039> on<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.399> screen<00:00:47.789> it<00:00:48.149> isn't<00:00:48.649> the

assemble on the screen it isn't the

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.069 
assemble on the screen it isn't the
reason<00:00:49.800> is<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.309> think<00:00:50.370> because<00:00:51.180> either<00:00:51.690> the

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
reason is I think because either the

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.290 
reason is I think because either the
butt<00:00:52.260> lights<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.100> screen<00:00:53.670> has<00:00:53.940> stopped

butt lights of the screen has stopped

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.010 
butt lights of the screen has stopped
working<00:00:55.699> if<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:57.120> screen<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.390> working<00:00:57.809> fine

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
working if the screen is working fine

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.560 
working if the screen is working fine
and<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.590> button<00:00:58.890> light<00:00:59.010> isn't<00:00:59.340> working<00:01:00.000> it

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
and the button light isn't working it

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.569 
and the button light isn't working it
