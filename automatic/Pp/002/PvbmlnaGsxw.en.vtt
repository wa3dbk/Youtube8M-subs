 hair ahead of us right now 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.710
 I had a relaxed time knows 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.180
 playing for you and enjoying the music 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.580
 delicious 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.490
 Good, now, seriously, let's talk. 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:12.060
 divide our hair then from above 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.890
 from the root of our hair to the direction of 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.880
 ear looks like my finger is showing 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.250
 for you 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.450
 until the direction of the ear repeats the 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.369
 process of the other side girls 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.930
 Good now I have separated two images for you 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.299
 it's on the left is more 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.400
 accelerated and the right side left more 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.750
 slow then how can you see your 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.659
 right side which is also more 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.189
 and divides into three equal parts and 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.110
 I'll start making a braid 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.729
 a normal braid 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.680
 on the other side you will follow the 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.950
 process in the most open chamber 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:47.040
 Ok girls, I'll get the part of the 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.829
 front throws back draws back 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.610
 as shown on this right side and plays 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.860
 forward 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.560
 then my finger pointed at you 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.810
 I'll get some of the part from the 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.579
 front and join with that little 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.130
 I was there and I'm doing that 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.500
 new braid inlay braid process 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.750
 I'm showing you where 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.910
 These strands have to come to you. 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.069
 they can do the braid and then we'll go 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.770
 to be making this braid with all this 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.720
 the front part that separates us 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.170
 Come on, I'm speeding up for you guys. 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.300
 and braids in secret until the 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.040
 Last 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.110
 so now I have both parts 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.630
 same as I finished braiding, let's go 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.150
 back you stop back 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.890
 that the party that will promote a year is 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.280
 Look how you can see I made a 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.860
 circus fight that my finger in circle 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.440
 to pick up these wicks and now I've separated 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.600
 two parts is with the bottom two 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.750
 equal parts and fastens with the elastic 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.160
 quino with this little net is well 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.840
 transparent those souls who do not 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.630
 Appears when you apply I go 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.300
 put one on each little girls ass 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.580
 so I put one on one side of the 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.830
 other side and secure with a staple're 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.930
 because it will help to ensure my 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.200
 hair and the format to achieve 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.790
 working with him looks only like a 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.590
 within each within your network 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.020
 It was logical and then I will be able to 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.840
 work with her, look, there we go 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:14.180
 trying to create formats and drawings so 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.190
 the designs can be of the most varied 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.150
 this is just me 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.930
 hair fitting and stapling without 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.360
 none 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.070
 Neura knows but there what you do 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.170
 can be looking in the mirror too 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.630
 you will see on that looks just cool that 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.060
 network it will help you to create 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.709
 in the hair there the curls are all 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.810
 full of formats there is a 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:39.400
 girls charm and then I'll do the same 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.400
 thing on the other side 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.240
 on the other side of an approximate 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.790
 you can have a little better 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.620
 so it's putting the clamp on and on and on 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.450
 molding if you have a mirror in the 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.040
 front of the mirror behind and be much more 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.200
 easy for you to do if you go 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.060
 doing it alone is interesting as she 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.930
 I wanted to look there the way I did. 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.330
 I shake it by the hand 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:02.860
 it creates several different formats I 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:05.170
 I loved using this technique girls 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:08.170
 good now this is the result of the two 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.870
 parts already ready with the top 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.920
 We're going to do mohawk technique. 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.630
 undoing all hair 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.810
 this time using a pink tittie 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:18.940
 simple and then I'll get these 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.519
 pimples that serve to increase the 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:25.300
 Mohawk volume if you do not have you 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:27.460
 can use sun adu said it's in the case 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.880
 as I have what I'll do I'll get 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:33.790
 she looks just like she has those teeth 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.560
 listen to her down and I'll put her 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:39.390
 there on the bottom because I want 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:43.330
 volume only behind so I'll play hair 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:44.980
 and I'm going to lose it with staples 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.260
 So I'll give you a lift to 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:50.830
 that's the pha more and look how it is 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.540
 raised as it is tall and very bulky 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.610
 I learned from the clips how you can 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:58.260
 see there and now we're going to hide 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:01.540
 these grains making curls right 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:03.790
 Look at all this ass 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:07.590
 look that we make curls look at the 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.590
 curls taking a magic step 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:13.180
 before going to make the curls I go 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:15.280
 a little bit ahead of my 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.350
 hair all this transition and I'm going to give 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.990
 one I dropped on because I do not want to be 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:23.290
 so sure you know I'm a little bit 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:26.440
 All the way to the top and there I 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:29.080
 I fasten it back with clamps until 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:31.990
 so I can hide this braid now 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:35.020
 with the curls is now the time of the 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:37.630
 girls curls so coil goes creating 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:39.310
 format with the proper format of the cluster 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:41.169
 Look how you can see and it will 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.360
 stapling so I take advantage of the 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:45.010
 shape that the dog creates. 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.979
 When we do baby liss and I go 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:48.610
 making the effects of it and putting the 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:50.680
 grains 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.990
 This is the end result. 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.669
 Beautiful people, it's wonderful. 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:57.250

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:59.290
 there a suggestion if you want to give a bad 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:01.660
 I know more and more romantic play a 

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:03.580
 little more pulled is to put these 13 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:05.680
 lines that you find in several 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.570
 places and then you can by spot light 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.360
 can use other accessories 

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:12.490
 Use your girls creativity and I stayed
