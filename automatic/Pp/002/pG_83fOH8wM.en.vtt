hi guys is t so today is my wash day and
I<00:00:10.889> will<00:00:11.070> be<00:00:11.160> giving<00:00:11.429> myself<00:00:11.580> a<00:00:11.880> protein

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
I will be giving myself a protein

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.959 
I will be giving myself a protein
treatment<00:00:12.809> I<00:00:12.990> will<00:00:13.559> be<00:00:13.650> using<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.219> organic<00:00:14.429> or

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
treatment I will be using the organic or

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.519 
treatment I will be using the organic or
a<00:00:15.059> stimulator<00:00:15.599> caramel

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
a stimulator caramel

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.980 
a stimulator caramel
now<00:00:17.340> I<00:00:17.369> haven't<00:00:17.609> used<00:00:17.880> this<00:00:18.060> in<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.270> past<00:00:18.390> I

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
now I haven't used this in the past I

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.529 
now I haven't used this in the past I
was<00:00:19.680> natural<00:00:20.070> up<00:00:20.160> into<00:00:20.400> high<00:00:20.550> school<00:00:20.970> I<00:00:21.270> used

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
was natural up into high school I used

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.689 
was natural up into high school I used
it<00:00:21.689> a<00:00:21.750> couple<00:00:21.779> of<00:00:22.080> times<00:00:22.260> then<00:00:22.590> oh<00:00:22.890> my<00:00:23.519> God<00:00:23.670> my

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
it a couple of times then oh my God my

it a couple of times then oh my God my
first<00:00:24.000> relaxer<00:00:24.630> and<00:00:25.050> I<00:00:25.320> used<00:00:25.560> it<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:26.070> couple<00:00:26.130> of

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
first relaxer and I used it a couple of

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.640 
first relaxer and I used it a couple of
times<00:00:26.730> during<00:00:27.000> my<00:00:27.119> relaxed<00:00:27.750> days<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.439> I

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
times during my relaxed days and I

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.320 
times during my relaxed days and I
totally<00:00:28.920> forgot<00:00:29.070> about<00:00:29.550> it<00:00:29.609> until<00:00:29.760> like<00:00:30.029> four

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
totally forgot about it until like four

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.099 
totally forgot about it until like four
or<00:00:30.420> five<00:00:30.570> months<00:00:30.869> ago

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
or five months ago

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.680 
or five months ago
and<00:00:31.349> I<00:00:32.219> needed<00:00:32.579> something<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:33.030> make<00:00:33.180> my<00:00:33.450> hair<00:00:33.660> a

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
and I needed something to make my hair a

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.040 
and I needed something to make my hair a
little<00:00:33.780> bit<00:00:33.989> stronger<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:35.480> to<00:00:36.480> prevent<00:00:36.930> it

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
little bit stronger and to prevent it

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.970 
little bit stronger and to prevent it
from<00:00:37.079> breaking<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:38.100> being<00:00:38.250> fragile<00:00:38.550> so<00:00:39.059> I

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
from breaking and being fragile so I

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.040 
from breaking and being fragile so I
purchased<00:00:40.980> this<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:42.090> says<00:00:42.329> new<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:42.690> improved

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
purchased this it says new and improved

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.560 
purchased this it says new and improved
health<00:00:43.290> fights<00:00:44.040> shedding<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:44.940> breakage<00:00:45.390> and

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
health fights shedding and breakage and

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.080 
health fights shedding and breakage and
it<00:00:45.930> has<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.110> boost<00:00:46.920> of<00:00:47.129> wheat<00:00:47.340> germ<00:00:47.370> along<00:00:47.910> now

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
it has a boost of wheat germ along now

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.490 
it has a boost of wheat germ along now
in<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.270> past<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:48.629> didn't<00:00:48.809> have<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.170> but<00:00:49.320> it

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
in the past I didn't have it but it

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.619 
in the past I didn't have it but it
still<00:00:49.770> works<00:00:50.039> pretty<00:00:50.280> much<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.520> same<00:00:50.670> if<00:00:51.390> your

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
still works pretty much the same if your

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.660 
still works pretty much the same if your
protein<00:00:52.020> sensitive<00:00:52.620> it's<00:00:53.190> not<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.370> good<00:00:53.550> idea

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
protein sensitive it's not a good idea

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.420 
protein sensitive it's not a good idea
because<00:00:54.090> it<00:00:54.329> is<00:00:54.449> packed<00:00:54.840> with<00:00:55.050> egg<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.190> mayo

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
because it is packed with egg and mayo

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.090 
because it is packed with egg and mayo
protein<00:00:57.030> in<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.500> my<00:00:58.500> hair<00:00:58.680> loves<00:00:58.890> this

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
protein in it and my hair loves this

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.889 
protein in it and my hair loves this
stuff<00:00:59.309> so<00:00:59.910> I<00:01:00.600> use<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.649> about<00:01:01.890> one<00:01:02.850> month<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.539> two

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
stuff so I use it about one month to two

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.420 
stuff so I use it about one month to two
months<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:04.350> just<00:01:04.530> depends<00:01:04.890> on<00:01:05.010> my<00:01:05.070> hair<00:01:05.400> I

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
months it just depends on my hair I

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.160 
months it just depends on my hair I
don't<00:01:05.700> like<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:06.060> over<00:01:06.270> do<00:01:06.689> a<00:01:06.720> protein

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
don't like to over do a protein

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.870 
don't like to over do a protein
treatment<00:01:07.380> because<00:01:07.950> sometimes<00:01:08.340> it<00:01:08.490> can<00:01:08.670> tend

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
treatment because sometimes it can tend

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.210 
treatment because sometimes it can tend
to<00:01:09.210> dry<00:01:10.170> your<00:01:10.380> hair<00:01:10.530> out<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.710> little<00:01:11.040> bit

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
to dry your hair out a little bit

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.770 
to dry your hair out a little bit
alright<00:01:11.490> what<00:01:11.670> I<00:01:11.729> do<00:01:11.820> is<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.150> like<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.299> field<00:01:12.659> it

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
alright what I do is I like to field it

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.050 
alright what I do is I like to field it
into<00:01:13.049> my<00:01:13.170> hair<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.560> if<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:13.830> can<00:01:14.010> hear<00:01:14.280> my<00:01:14.670> ends

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
into my hair and if I can hear my ends

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.210 
into my hair and if I can hear my ends
and<00:01:15.240> it's<00:01:15.780> crispy<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.830> you<00:01:16.920> know<00:01:17.040> what<00:01:17.130> I'm

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
and it's crispy and you know what I'm

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.280

talking about it is in need of some type

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.399 
talking about it is in need of some type
of<00:01:19.320> treatment<00:01:20.509> what<00:01:21.509> I<00:01:21.540> also<00:01:21.780> like<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.110> do<00:01:22.290> is

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
of treatment what I also like to do is

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.070 
of treatment what I also like to do is
pull<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.650> strand<00:01:23.009> of<00:01:23.159> hair<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.700> I<00:01:24.479> like<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.840> pull

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
pull a strand of hair and I like to pull

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.710 
pull a strand of hair and I like to pull
it<00:01:25.229> now<00:01:25.409> if<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.619> snaps<00:01:25.830> quickly<00:01:26.460> in<00:01:27.270> need<00:01:27.509> of<00:01:27.540> a

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
it now if it snaps quickly in need of a

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.260 
it now if it snaps quickly in need of a
protein<00:01:28.110> treatment<00:01:28.290> so<00:01:29.130> I'll<00:01:29.490> do<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:29.939> it's

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
protein treatment so I'll do that it's

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.450 
protein treatment so I'll do that it's
about<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.750> month<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.229> two<00:01:31.530> months<00:01:31.560> just<00:01:31.950> depends

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
about a month to two months just depends

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.340 
about a month to two months just depends
from<00:01:32.909> my<00:01:33.030> lint<00:01:33.270> check<00:01:33.509> video<00:01:33.689> I<00:01:33.869> got<00:01:34.200> some

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
from my lint check video I got some

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.140 
from my lint check video I got some
questions<00:01:34.530> on<00:01:34.860> what<00:01:35.159> helped<00:01:35.520> me<00:01:35.549> retain<00:01:35.970> my

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
questions on what helped me retain my

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.350 
questions on what helped me retain my
lint<00:01:36.390> from<00:01:37.110> last<00:01:37.619> six-month<00:01:38.610> lint<00:01:38.880> check<00:01:39.119> and

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
lint from last six-month lint check and

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.289 
lint from last six-month lint check and
I<00:01:39.930> really<00:01:40.500> think<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:41.040> just<00:01:41.520> had<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.729> lot<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.180> do

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
I really think it just had a lot to do

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.149 
I really think it just had a lot to do
with<00:01:42.329> it<00:01:42.600> because<00:01:42.689> my<00:01:43.020> ends<00:01:43.380> are<00:01:43.470> stronger<00:01:44.009> I

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
with it because my ends are stronger I

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.530 
with it because my ends are stronger I
haven't<00:01:44.520> seen<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.729> split<00:01:45.299> in<00:01:45.659> in<00:01:46.490> months<00:01:47.540> my

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
haven't seen a split in in months my

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.649 
haven't seen a split in in months my
hair<00:01:48.979> doesn't<00:01:51.409> feel<00:01:52.700> fragile<00:01:53.700> it's<00:01:54.149> very

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
hair doesn't feel fragile it's very
