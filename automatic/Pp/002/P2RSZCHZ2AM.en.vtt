00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
going to be a thin section about a

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.440 
going to be a thin section about a
quarter<00:01:04.379> inch<00:01:04.409> down<00:01:04.799> from<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.280> upper<00:01:06.000> lip<00:01:06.240> and

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
inch that I'm going to pierce after I'm

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.920 
inch that I'm going to pierce after I'm
done<00:01:13.439> turning<00:01:14.100> this<00:01:14.250> so<00:01:14.909> I'm<00:01:15.299> going<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.720> take

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
done turning this so I'm going to take

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.969 
done turning this so I'm going to take
it<00:01:16.170> from<00:01:16.439> quarter<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.390> 5/16<00:01:18.390> wall<00:01:18.689> here<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.439> I

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
it from quarter to 5/16 wall here and I

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.429 
it from quarter to 5/16 wall here and I
want<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.280> go<00:01:20.430> in<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:21.210> section<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:22.170> about<00:01:22.409> a

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
want to go in that section to about a

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.469 
want to go in that section to about a
sixteenth<00:01:23.040> inch<00:01:23.310> wall<00:01:24.560> it's<00:01:25.560> hard<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:25.979> do<00:01:26.159> that

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
sixteenth inch wall it's hard to do that

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.050 
sixteenth inch wall it's hard to do that
by<00:01:27.479> trial<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.350> error<00:01:28.520> but<00:01:29.520> what<00:01:29.670> I'm<00:01:29.759> going<00:01:29.939> to

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
by trial and error but what I'm going to

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.960 
by trial and error but what I'm going to
do<00:01:30.270> is<00:01:30.420> use<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.869> tool<00:01:31.110> that<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:31.680> make<00:01:32.009> in<00:01:32.700> the

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
do is use the tool that I make in the

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.319 
do is use the tool that I make in the
small<00:01:33.240> version<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:34.020> what<00:01:35.009> I've<00:01:35.130> done<00:01:35.369> here<00:01:35.790> is

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
small version and what I've done here is

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.510 
small version and what I've done here is
I've<00:01:36.600> taken<00:01:36.630> this<00:01:37.200> bit<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.850> I've<00:01:39.540> made<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:40.520> see

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
I've taken this bit and I've made it see

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.139 
I've taken this bit and I've made it see
if<00:01:41.610> we<00:01:41.670> can<00:01:41.790> get<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.180> just<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.229> blunt<00:01:43.470> nose

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
if we can get that just the blunt nose

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.569 
if we can get that just the blunt nose
so<00:01:45.149> square<00:01:45.540> it<00:01:45.630> off<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:46.590> what<00:01:47.100> I'm<00:01:47.189> going<00:01:47.430> to

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
so square it off and what I'm going to

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.090 
so square it off and what I'm going to
do<00:01:47.759> is<00:01:47.970> set<00:01:48.210> it<00:01:48.329> up<00:01:48.509> so<00:01:49.290> that<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.530> shoulder<00:01:49.979> of

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
do is set it up so that the shoulder of

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.370 
do is set it up so that the shoulder of
the<00:01:50.250> tool<00:01:50.460> when<00:01:50.790> it<00:01:50.820> hits<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.420> inside<00:01:51.780> surface

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
the tool when it hits the inside surface

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.219 
the tool when it hits the inside surface
allows<00:01:53.310> us<00:01:53.549> bit<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:54.030> only<00:01:54.180> go<00:01:54.479> down<00:01:54.750> enough<00:01:55.200> to

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
allows us bit to only go down enough to

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.280 
allows us bit to only go down enough to
give<00:01:55.560> me<00:01:55.680> that<00:01:55.860> final<00:01:56.340> wall<00:01:56.869> so<00:01:57.869> let's<00:01:58.170> adjust

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
give me that final wall so let's adjust

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.160 
give me that final wall so let's adjust
it<00:01:58.680> for<00:01:58.829> that

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.880 

loosen<00:02:03.130> it<00:02:03.220> up<00:02:03.250> here<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:05.110> I'm<00:02:05.260> going<00:02:05.500> to<00:02:05.680> take

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
loosen it up here and I'm going to take

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.440 
loosen it up here and I'm going to take
it<00:02:06.130> and<00:02:06.460> move<00:02:07.360> it<00:02:07.479> in<00:02:08.399> until<00:02:09.399> I'm<00:02:09.640> leaving

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
it and move it in until I'm leaving

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.350 
it and move it in until I'm leaving
about<00:02:10.600> a<00:02:10.750> sixteenth<00:02:11.319> inch<00:02:11.560> wall<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:13.000> tighten

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
about a sixteenth inch wall and tighten

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:21.880 
about a sixteenth inch wall and tighten
it<00:02:13.390> back<00:02:13.600> up

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.490 

so<00:02:23.620> you<00:02:24.620> can<00:02:24.770> see<00:02:24.950> that<00:02:25.160> now<00:02:25.460> when<00:02:26.240> I<00:02:26.270> go<00:02:26.540> in<00:02:27.050> it

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
so you can see that now when I go in it

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.360 
so you can see that now when I go in it
should<00:02:27.890> leave<00:02:28.160> that<00:02:28.690> little<00:02:29.690> bit<00:02:30.190> and<00:02:31.190> I'll

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
should leave that little bit and I'll

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.240 
should leave that little bit and I'll
make<00:02:31.610> my<00:02:31.790> first<00:02:32.000> cut<00:02:32.320> what<00:02:33.320> I'll<00:02:33.440> do<00:02:33.650> after<00:02:34.130> the

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
make my first cut what I'll do after the

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:35.710 
make my first cut what I'll do after the
first<00:02:34.460> cut<00:02:34.730> though<00:02:34.970> is<00:02:35.180> I'll<00:02:35.330> just<00:02:35.360> keep

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
first cut though is I'll just keep

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.680 
first cut though is I'll just keep
indexing<00:02:36.410> over<00:02:36.590> and<00:02:37.010> left<00:02:37.730> until<00:02:38.180> I<00:02:38.210> get<00:02:38.480> the

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
indexing over and left until I get the

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.800 
indexing over and left until I get the
width<00:02:39.080> that<00:02:39.290> I<00:02:39.320> want<00:02:39.650> so<00:02:40.610> that<00:02:40.850> the<00:02:41.120> shoulder

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
width that I want so that the shoulder

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.230 
width that I want so that the shoulder
of<00:02:41.870> the<00:02:41.930> tool<00:02:42.220> will<00:02:43.220> always<00:02:43.520> be<00:02:43.700> hitting<00:02:43.910> them

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
of the tool will always be hitting them

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:49.150 
of the tool will always be hitting them
the<00:02:44.510> wall<00:02:45.220> let's<00:02:46.220> see<00:02:46.430> if<00:02:46.550> this<00:02:46.730> works<00:02:47.390> and<00:02:48.160> it

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
the wall let's see if this works and it

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.770 
the wall let's see if this works and it
will<00:02:49.370> give<00:02:49.550> you<00:02:49.670> another<00:02:49.910> technique<00:02:50.450> that<00:02:50.690> you

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
will give you another technique that you

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.040 
will give you another technique that you
can<00:02:50.810> use<00:02:50.959> for<00:02:51.380> this<00:02:51.500> kind<00:02:51.709> of<00:02:51.860> work<00:02:52.070> so<00:02:53.050> turn

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
can use for this kind of work so turn

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.170 
can use for this kind of work so turn
the<00:02:54.200> lathe<00:02:54.350> on<00:02:54.620> my<00:02:55.010> lathe<00:02:55.280> I<00:02:55.520> can<00:02:56.110> move<00:02:57.110> the

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
the lathe on my lathe I can move the

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.970 
the lathe on my lathe I can move the
ball<00:02:59.180> down<00:02:59.240> near<00:02:59.900> the<00:03:00.050> end<00:03:00.260> side<00:03:00.680> going<00:03:00.920> to

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
ball down near the end side going to

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.620 
ball down near the end side going to
have<00:03:01.160> a<00:03:01.190> nice<00:03:01.459> convenient<00:03:02.090> way<00:03:02.209> to<00:03:02.270> approach

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
have a nice convenient way to approach

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:03.540 
have a nice convenient way to approach
it<00:03:02.690> here

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
it here

00:03:03.550 --> 00:04:19.540 
it here
let's<00:03:04.550> turn<00:03:04.790> this<00:03:04.970> on

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:19.550 

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:23.780 

I've<00:04:20.550> gotten<00:04:20.910> nice<00:04:21.120> and<00:04:21.360> thin<00:04:21.650> and<00:04:22.700> that's<00:04:23.700> a

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
I've gotten nice and thin and that's a

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:25.610 
I've gotten nice and thin and that's a
nice<00:04:23.970> width<00:04:24.270> I'm<00:04:24.600> going<00:04:24.780> to<00:04:24.840> work<00:04:24.990> with<00:04:25.260> I<00:04:25.440> can

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
nice width I'm going to work with I can

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.440 
nice width I'm going to work with I can
sand<00:04:25.830> that<00:04:26.040> down<00:04:26.250> now<00:04:26.580> and<00:04:28.760> you<00:04:29.760> can<00:04:29.940> see<00:04:30.150> how

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
sand that down now and you can see how

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:33.860 
sand that down now and you can see how
every<00:04:31.320> time<00:04:31.500> I<00:04:31.530> went<00:04:31.830> over<00:04:32.130> is<00:04:33.120> the<00:04:33.420> next<00:04:33.690> one

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
every time I went over is the next one

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.420 
every time I went over is the next one
and<00:04:33.990> I<00:04:34.110> could<00:04:34.320> use<00:04:34.470> the<00:04:34.620> shoulder<00:04:34.860> of<00:04:35.130> the<00:04:35.160> tool

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
and I could use the shoulder of the tool

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.660 
and I could use the shoulder of the tool
as<00:04:36.210> a<00:04:36.270> stop<00:04:36.780> so<00:04:37.620> I<00:04:37.650> could<00:04:37.950> always<00:04:38.340> have<00:04:38.640> the

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:38.670 
as a stop so I could always have the

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:42.320 
as a stop so I could always have the
same<00:04:38.970> depth<00:04:39.770> this<00:04:40.770> will<00:04:40.980> work<00:04:41.160> well<00:04:41.520> provided

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
same depth this will work well provided

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.900 
same depth this will work well provided
your<00:04:42.570> wall<00:04:42.840> thickness<00:04:43.440> is<00:04:43.860> consistent<00:04:44.820> over

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
your wall thickness is consistent over

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.320 
your wall thickness is consistent over
that<00:04:45.210> distance<00:04:45.450> that<00:04:45.840> you<00:04:45.930> want<00:04:46.110> to<00:04:46.200> do<00:04:46.320> it<00:04:46.440> in

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
that distance that you want to do it in

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.600 
that distance that you want to do it in
there<00:04:48.330> you<00:04:48.450> go
