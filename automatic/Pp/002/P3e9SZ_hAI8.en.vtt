00:00:08.829 --> 00:00:10.099
 years ago 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:13.199
 product of the need to update as regards the 

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:15.489
 information that horsemanship refers 

00:00:15.489 --> 00:00:19.589
 a group of professionals in the field was given the task of visualizing here 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:23.809
 propose the construction of a material that will help to better understand the 

00:00:23.809 --> 00:00:26.699
 topic 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.860
 through editorial coordination 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.659
 of the faculty of higher education iztacala 

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:34.440
 The National Autonomous University of Mexico 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.340
 plasma the work of its specialists in an interface 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.990
 that brings knowledge and ritual mind materializes 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.890
 in the work 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.210
 flow of genetic genetic information in ethics 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.389
 considering the importance of a project of this nature 

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:55.929
 and taking advantage of the possibilities provided by the digital medium was designed 

00:00:55.929 --> 00:01:00.109
 a multimedia interface that gives simplicity and here science 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:03.290
 to the teaching-learning process 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.080
 the toolbar although it does the user 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.800
 to familiarize and interact in a friendly way with the interface 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.820
 and in case of presenting difficulties 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.690
 the design offers the possibility to consult help in photography and video 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:18.970
 in order to show 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.390
 the simplest and most practical way 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.390
 to navigate through the information 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.710
 the horizontal tabs indicate the main themes of the work 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.070
 when the desired option is selected 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.560
 a navigation tree is displayed on the left side of the screen 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.520
 which is the displacement phase enter activity with all the material 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.960
 and tools that constitute the project 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.190
 the user has the possibility to move 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.800
 through the content 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.130
 thanks to hierarchically ordered folders 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.909
 and that can be displayed one by one reviewing topics 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:00.230
 for its part more 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.750
 either in order as presented in the written work 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.520
 or in a way to the heat oria 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.530
 locating independent themes without having to review the options catalog by 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:12.849
 full 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:16.389
 as part of the composition of the events for easy understanding 

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:20.229
 a menu was designed through which you can visualize 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:23.519
 images images 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.499
 Animation Animation Animation 

00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:29.199
 audio and video files 

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:31.219
 reinforcing knowledge 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:34.389
 through hearing and sight jointly 

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:37.989
 always in provo of the efficiency of the teaching-learning process 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:41.380
 If necessary 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.609
 and in order to study in detail 

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:47.899
 you can increase the size of the images in two levels before arriving 

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:49.409
 to full screen 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:53.549
 additionally it is possible to access your data at any time 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:56.789
 general 

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:59.829
 through elements of information support 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:03.699
 this interface provides a series of complementary readings that will 

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:06.699
 make it possible to delve into some of the themes 

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:08.919
 also leagues and internet 

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:11.829
 related to what is being consulted 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:14.369
 this tool is very important 

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:19.509
 since connected to the network makes possible the constant updating of the topics 

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:23.039
 regardless of the date of consultation of the multimedia material 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:27.330
 offers the bibliography used 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.759
 and a glossary of concepts 

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:35.079
 exploited all the enclosures and possibilities of the interface 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:36.479
 and once traveled 

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:39.829
 the system offers one of the most significant advantages 

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:43.209
 to self-evaluation 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.029
 process where the user 

00:03:45.029 --> 00:03:47.169
 can measure the level of learning 

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:50.469
 obtained after having interacted with the multimedia material 

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:56.369
 the program will help you assess your level of understanding and assimilation of 

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:57.469
 knowledge 

00:03:57.469 --> 00:03:58.849
 questioning it 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:03.819
 through specific questions about the topics studied and deploying 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:05.559
 response options 

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:07.100
 of which will be selected 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.100
 one that will be compared with the database 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:14.669
 this process will be done with the number of questions that the user 

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:16.019
 want to answer 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.590
 once completed 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.020
 the interface will yield a detailed report of the number of hits 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:22.800
 mistakes 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.800
 in addition to a final grade 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.319
 the collection of genetic information flow 

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:34.900
 is the result of the collaborative work of experts in the field 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.330
 of the financing of the papini program 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.080
 and a team of communication and design professionals 

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:45.529
 focused on offering a digital interface 

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:48.190
 that extends the possibilities of the process 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:49.999
 teaching-learning 

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:53.409
 making use of technological advances 

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:55.170
 this is one of the ways 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.199
 in which the National Autonomous University of Mexico 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:01.460
 in his faculty of higher education iztacala 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.980
 promote interdisciplinary projects 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.280
 to obtain academic benefits 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.970
 that help the construction 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:08.960
 and knowledge transmission
