00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.840
 the half goldsmith and today I have 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.730
 a topic for you surely everybody 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.009
 concerns 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:25.680
 and to which everyone surely also his 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:27.720
 views and his opinion but has 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:35.280
 first there is a sip of coffee prost 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:38.010
 namely the topic of alcohol and fitness 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.379
 Alcohol in bodybuilding without alcohol 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.540
 generally 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.940
 you certainly have all the experience 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.070
 alcohol provided over 18 are what 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.400
 I talk when you are over 14 you have 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.650
 probably experiences with alcohol 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.479
 And there are many 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.850
 opinions there are lots of fitness 

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:59.909
 youtuber there are a lot of those 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.229
 I even really appreciate where 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:05.070
 I think that's very telling 

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:07.710
 meaningful things zb which is with weigel 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.780
 a really great contact person for 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.390
 everything training and nutrition issues 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.250
 are notification look in there 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.000
 I can only thumb my thumb 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.920
 Very high type with a very high type 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.170
 know a lot and that represents that 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.310
 also pretty much my view 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.140
 but I do not have one yet 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.240
 single of these fitness youtube 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.179
 really considered a strict 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.189
 opinion on the alcohol and there I would like 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:37.590
 give the counterpoint a bit 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.780
 because I think alcohol is 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.710
 continues to be the worst thing ye 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.700
 Antun could be in sports nutrition 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.990
 Alcohol just a disaster 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.719
 Alcohol does that with your body 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.289
 unbelievably many negative things besides 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:56.909
 what you already know everything anyway 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:58.409
 Maybe you can not do that 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.159
 Maybe you think so 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.030
 not at all 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.720
 that's the point at the thing you know 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.120
 Of course, the negative anyway 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.740
 empty wallet always calls 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.149
 because we spent a lot of money for 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:15.040
 Alcohol if you are on the way with 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:16.780
 your guys it makes you fat a gram 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.290
 Alcohol has seven calories so 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.730
 between carbohydrates and fats 49 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.900
 in between we have the lessons beautifully 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.550
 they can only pull in the liver 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.590
 be metabolized that alcohol the 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.110
 liver is mined vista everyone else 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.270
 physical processes become behind 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.190
 hired that means the first time will be 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.170
 calories on the outside burned alcohol so 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.050
 the metabolism is full in that sense 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.180
 from arch your protein synthesis is full 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:44.380
 from arch your fat burning is full 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.150
 from haas the one I valued very much 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.530
 Mr. pine says yes that one can yes 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:52.090
 even use the muscles to protect 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:54.010
 diet age administrator i would like to 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.680
 do not support or see any case 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.850
 I definitely do not leave it that way 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.640
 the fingers of it 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:03.010
 next to the already mentioned as mentioned 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.220
 effects makes made dependent skull 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.990
 There are loads of things 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.769
 things that are still right for the sport 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:13.239
 shit and although alcohol is also yours 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:15.280
 down hormone secretion 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.380
 that is a rush and mine 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.959
 we live with a total of 1.0 per thousand 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.450
 and that is easily achieved if 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:24.010
 Maybe one twice a month what 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.190
 drinks and giving it a certain amount 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.560
 It has no getting used to 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.470
 problem to come to 1.0 promille 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.730
 45 are beer and 10 timid though 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.430
 Be tall and strong 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:39.220
 that is a full thrill of the sets for the 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.140
 next two weeks your testosterone 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.940
 have distribution and above all things 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.140
 yes also sets your growth hormones 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.880
 distributions from that is here 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.620
 trained how stupid but trained here 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.670
 really just about any 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.980
 to burn calories 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.600
 these are all complex processes in the 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.640
 Body is clear to me even if you 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.650
 every weekend you can drink something 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.239
 You can have muscle building successes 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.310
 have done lose weight and so on 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:03.370
 and so on, but introduce yourself 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.470
 now you'll save the fuck like that 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.760
 your successes 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.110
 I also know athletes over and over again 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.690
 Something to drink that not every 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:13.240
 weekend once a month back and forth and 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.620
 they also say their human rights if 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.780
 that would be so bad if we had the 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.100
 discussion formats 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.810
 then I would not have any muscles 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.340
 I said that, of course 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.300
 you still muscles what a still 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.460
 training stimulus you have anyway 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.830
 surplus of calories you know what you do 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.360
 of course you do have others, of course 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.610
 processes in a body for that 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.910
 make sure you do not want that is completely 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.320
 it's not that toxic 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.030
 it will be very forbidden 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.310
 that's just the thing in principle 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:42.310
 why the availability and the 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.810
 General acceptance of the alcohol 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.700
 problem on the matter not the 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.640
 harmlessness or in any one 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:52.210
 form the goodness of the addiction of 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:53.350
 drug alcohol in itself is what 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.270
 is acceptable but this 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:58.480
 socially universal 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:00.610
 Alcohol is really really acceptable 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:03.400
 In sports the worst thing they do to you 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.200
 can take the fingers of mine 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.730
 Appeal to you I have the first ones 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.230
 one and a half years in which I train 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:10.630
 have 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:14.530
 maybe drunk 45 times alcohol 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:16.090
 That was to New Year once that was with 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:18.340
 a good friend we have seen each other 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.080
 always a glass of whiskey and even 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.970
 since it was really small amounts though 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.530
 when I see my dietitian 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.820
 and I just did it 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.310
 myself as always with the 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:29.140
 matter 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:32.530
 how harmful alcohol is I have 

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:34.660
 Bern said up to this point no further 0 0 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:37.210
 You do not have to do that so rigorously 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:38.919
 how I do that but in general 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.120
 Keep your mind in the back of your mind 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:40.990
 Testosterone is released 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.210
 reduced 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.080
 your growth hormone distribution is 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:47.020
 reduced 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:49.570
 how far we have been there undecided 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.890
 there are experiments with rats you know 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:54.010
 that is always transferred to the 

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:55.810
 Humans are feasible as I said that is 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:57.430
 all genetically not so different 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:59.680
 as you might imagine 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.630
 Of course you can also do it on everyone 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.950
 statistics 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:04.650
 Of course, one must always have doubts 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:07.560
 very clear thing 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:09.419
 it always comes with experiments that 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:12.780
 get out what you want that comes out completely 

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:15.030
 clear but nonetheless dispensed with 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:16.460
 just do not look where it is 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:18.570
 It does not need to take you either 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:21.419
 all the people I really know 

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:22.979
 was not drinking and thats from the 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:25.139
 athletic people are the most nothing 

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:26.789
 I drink them anyway 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:28.199
 fun it is not that we are in 

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:29.940
 some form of opinion are around 

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:31.740
 my god we have much more now 

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:33.150
 had fun when each of us drunk 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.940
 would have been or in any form 

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:37.860
 drunk or something 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:39.840
 abstains from doing their sport 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:42.210
 with a bit of seriousness remains 

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:44.880
 decided and just let the 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:47.220
 negative consequences of alcohol not into 

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:49.770
 Bockshorn does not hunt down in not chase 

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:51.060
 any shape to meet the 

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:53.160
 the financial consequences follow 

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.669
 follow holds the social 

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.820
 consequences 

00:06:53.669 --> 00:06:58.289
 I kopp my I'm more like metal fan 

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:59.760
 is that I'm a lot on festivals 

00:06:58.289 --> 00:07:01.530
 the way I am myself much on the 

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:02.849
 Of course, stage and I see it too 

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:04.500
 when people get started and 

00:07:02.849 --> 00:07:06.270
 Of course, I'm also happy 

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:08.550
 but on the other side keeps the 

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:10.500
 wake up in the morning with such a skull 

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:12.570
 they have 80 euros for a festival ticket 

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:14.880
 spent and overslept the first 

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:16.940
 five bands on friday and saturday because 

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:18.840
 she was already full on thursday as always 

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:21.990
 since not this type 

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:23.940
 since I just say it a little 

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:27.870
 better and above all things a little bit 

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:30.539
 know and stay tuned do your sport 

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:32.000

 See you next time 

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 sat
