 it's a mass 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.590
 inter Genoa race between two teams from 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.590
 noble past the match was disputed 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:08.710
 in San Siro as many as 59 times in a series with 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:12.070
 36 Nerazzurri affirmations and only 12 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:14.830
 genoane the last of which in 1994 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:17.200
 thanks to a rototolo shotgun 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.750
 as for the rest to be recorded an extreme 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.180
 Nerazzurri prolificacy in the last three 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.610
 years for the whole successful three times 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.979
 to score five genoa goals in one 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.479
 of the two seasonal races for two years 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.210
 it happens in san siro where last year 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:33.149
 Andrea Stramaccioni started as a coach 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.659
 of the first team with a pyrotechnician 5 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:36.429
 4 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.830
 to marassi the music changes but not of 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:40.360
 a lot of the inter remains very prolific the 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.759
 genoa but ahead from the point of 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.830
 numeric view with 23 successes and 21 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:46.390
 even if the rossoblÃ¹ dyed ferrarista is 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.759
 land of conquest for training 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.289
 Inter for four seasons in 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:52.840
 which the Ligurians never have, however 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:55.030
 marked from the point of view of the markers 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.220
 pay attention to a hat-trick 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.720
 in the last challenge as well as changing 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.720
 two goals in the Ligurian career
