00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 last but one lesson all optimizations 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.170
 our wordpress site 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.300
 and now we'll talk about ways 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:12.360
 speeding up website indexing about ways 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.020
 speeding up the indexing of new pages and 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.550
 new records 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.439
 globally we can do the following 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.840
 speed up site indexing 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.810
 First you need to create the right one. 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.880
 sitemap and robots.txt file 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.439
 which will help search robots 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.750
 navigate your site 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.780
 secondly we can perform pink 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.730
 web services automatic every time 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.809
 when posting new posts 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:42.809
 thirdly we can add new links 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:46.640
 and sitemap directly to webmaster and yandex 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:50.520
 and webmaster google and we can 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.949
 perform repost or repost announcements 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.890
 social network posts now 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.460
 consider each of these items more 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.699
 in detail here is my website and now I will show 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.680
 on his example that and so it is done 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:09.500
 well firstly the site map we created when 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:13.799
 google xml sitemaps plugin help 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:17.670
 Now I will show it here this plugin 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:20.070
 google xml sitemaps helps us 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.439
 create a site map here we are in it 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.200
 settings we can verify that the map 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.159
 the site really exists here is ours 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.960
 Site Map 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:34.110
 here we have all the ordered articles 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:36.509
 completely like this it was created 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.930
 then you need to check the file 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.930
 robots.txt 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:48.270
 the fact that there is no error in it 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:51.409
 the host is specified in it the card address is registered 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.390
 Site, see previous lessons 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:57.360
 robots.txt setup and about it already 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.880
 I will not repeat so 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.060
 next point in on 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:06.390
 settings and speeding up site indexing 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:10.830
 This is a pink web service for this click 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:13.920
 writing settings scroll down and 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.650
 here we have update services are those 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.440
 services that our wordpress site 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.890
 will automatically report the exit 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.590
 new post entry new article i 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.050
 collected quite a lot of services that 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.670
 will follow their site updates 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.780
 there are about two dozen 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:36.000
 You will find links to these services on my 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.420
 site in the corresponding article a little 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.269
 later add annotation on where this 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.730
 article can be found but basically you 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.599
 matter basically ping attack 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.780
 dot com 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:50.120
 the most important such service is feedburner 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.590
 dot com 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:58.530
 google instant service and in principle 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:01.250
 the rest have only a side effect 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.959
 They especially do not fundamentally unimportant 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.739
 the next important point is the addition 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:09.420
 links and site maps to webmaster 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:12.690
 in fact there are two webmasters is 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.819
 webmaster and yandex webmaster google in 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.370
 in many ways they look like i will show you on 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.630
 index example we authorize our 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.079
 account 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:24.720
 click webmaster and now open 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:27.299
 our site if you haven't added it yet 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.810
 add a site check out 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:32.609
 txt file download help to 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.560
 confirm ownership of 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:35.680
 This site is all technical issues. 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.900
 they 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.090
 visa difficulties I do not tell them 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.280
 when your site is added and it started 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.329
 indexed then you can manage 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.930
 its indexing click on the button 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:49.569
 site indexing 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:52.359
 next we can look at the structure 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:54.569
 site here are the pages that we have about 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:56.920
 indexed in which structural 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:59.469
 layouts they are displayed on the site 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.659
 Further setting indexing there will be 

00:03:59.469 --> 00:04:04.599
 We are interested in two items analysis 

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:07.260
 robots.txt here is our robot click 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:10.000
 upload site click check 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.400
 no errors, everything is fine if any 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.220
 errors he will write that such errors 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.780
 discovered and the next item here 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.690
 sitemap files 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.720
 These are site map files here I added 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.820
 the usual version of the site map and 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.139
 archiving sitemap option 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.840
 is in status ok 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:31.210
 you can see more here 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.880
 actually this sitemap here too 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.139
 indicated which version of the site map is 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.050
 when is the last time 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:41.409
 robot scan your site when it 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:43.840
 updated case oh about 2 times 

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:46.260
 weeks I sometimes more often the robot comes on 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.970
 your site see what has changed 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.460
 that's the way we work in 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.919
 webmaster 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:56.710
 then there is such a special service 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:59.020

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:03.090

 About the site 

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:18.430
 or for some inner page 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:21.220
 Well, for example, I wrote an article here 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:24.009
 such i want her to be faster point 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:28.169

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:31.860
 I choose confirmation code 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:42.020

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:44.930
 the address is successfully added according to 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:47.180
 crawling his robot will index it 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.530
 somewhat speed up the addition of the site to 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.660
 Yandex search engine 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.710
 similar can be done for google 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.870
 submit 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:54.830
 her google robot needs to be here 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.169
 log in 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:59.750
 next you also exactly put Iran 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:04.220
 enter captcha and send request all 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:06.620
 exactly the same thing sorted out and 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:10.100
 now the last item is the publication 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:12.440
 links in social networks here is my group 

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:15.080
 in a social network by the way 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:17.240
 come subscribe I'm telling 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.430
 also mont youtube monetization by 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.919
 ways to make money on youtube video this 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:25.250
 very promising direction so here 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:27.350
 in this group I do automatically and 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:30.110
 repost my records 

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:33.949
 what is the repost consists of 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:37.580
 pictures are required and links to the site and 

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:40.490
 from the name itself riposte so 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:42.680
 way we add a link here and she 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:44.900
 will be indexed faster not 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:47.660
 add only full-text versions 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:49.669
 your records because so in 

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:53.810
 social network posts are produced 

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:55.550
 faster and then you only lose from 

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:58.160
 this way we can 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:00.680
 I can speed up site indexing 

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:02.990
 that the site will be indexed faster 

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:05.720
 about twice what it happens 

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:08.720
 usually therefore use this 

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:11.270
 tool and it will help you faster 

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:14.479
 develop your website thank you for your attention 

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:17.260

00:07:14.479 --> 00:07:17.260
 course lesson
