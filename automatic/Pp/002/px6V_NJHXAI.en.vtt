00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.100
 Hello you and welcome 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.279
 to a new video of game me 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.740
 toys 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.889
 I have something very special for me today 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.170
 you the primeval crabs 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:16.049
 experiment box of cosmos suitable 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.570
 for children over eight years and you can 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.760
 so that his own salt crayfish run 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.400
 pull and watch as if from 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.039
 So tiny larvae become real crabs 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.510
 pretty exciting and exciting like me 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.039
 find 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.070
 Everything you need it already 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.530
 So you have a lot here 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.090
 researcher utensils and I would say 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.010
 we'll just pack it now 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.010
 and to look at it more closely 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:32.380
 so it goes with me ever get the 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:33.390
 instruction is to fold apart and 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.729
 in color 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.200
 which is cool and it seems that way 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:41.039
 a bit scientific 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.310
 to be raised so with so 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:45.550
 background information to the 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:51.429
 primeval crayfish I'll take a look 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:55.920
 more exactly then we have one here 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:02:00.520
 petrischale a small measuring cup 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:08.709
 here's a scale from zero to 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:16.540
 30 then we have one more here 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:18.730
 small plastic saving and one 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.470
 Another vessel I think will be here 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.470
 the primeval crayfish kept in it 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.140
 a pipette 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.430
 this is the lining 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.510
 'm curious if you buy more the 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.330
 can now see some kind of 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.530
 little bit out but the little ones 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:47.110
 cancer probably also eroded 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:54.500
 not so much we have on a good one 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:56.090
 I believe then salt as well as salt 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:01.819
 crabs that means they probably live 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:04.040
 in salt water and here are the 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:05.750
 eggs of salt crayfish in it that is 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.750
 These little eggs will become ours 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.690
 I do not know how to treat primate crayfish 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.609
 Imagine, I'm curious 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.379
 and that's it too, the carton is 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:16.579
 empty 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:17.780
 here you see now something all 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:19.940
 been there 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.120
 in the next video we will be there 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.920
 our primitive crabs that is to say 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.859
 We will help you with the solution 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.420
 then raise together and I believe 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:30.650
 this will be a long-term project that is 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.879
 I'll be back to you every now and then 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.049
 keep running like mine 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:35.150
 primeval crayfish leaves 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.409
 I hope you liked the video 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.840
