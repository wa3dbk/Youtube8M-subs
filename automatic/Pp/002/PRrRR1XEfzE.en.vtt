00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
like this don't really help I mean you

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.350 
like this don't really help I mean you
can<00:00:40.739> design<00:00:40.950> hundreds<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:41.910> hundreds<00:00:42.270> of

puzzles and fit them onto one cartridge

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.970 
puzzles and fit them onto one cartridge
but<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.809> can't<00:00:46.110> you<00:00:46.320> can't<00:00:46.530> arrange<00:00:46.770> them

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
but I you can't you can't arrange them

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.560 
but I you can't you can't arrange them
in<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.129> way<00:00:47.219> that<00:00:47.430> makes<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.730> game<00:00:47.879> easier<00:00:48.360> to

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
in a way that makes the game easier to

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.470 
in a way that makes the game easier to
navigate<00:00:48.770> understand<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:49.980> play<00:00:50.250> oh<00:00:50.550> that's

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
navigate understand and play oh that's

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.209 
navigate understand and play oh that's

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.590 

well<00:01:03.190> I<00:01:03.220> guess<00:01:03.489> it<00:01:03.640> must<00:01:03.820> be<00:01:04.059> because<00:01:04.269> this<00:01:04.540> is

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
well I guess it must be because this is

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
in this thing divided into about 25

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.600 
in this thing divided into about 25
different<00:01:38.080> varieties<00:01:38.380> there's<00:01:39.250> the<00:01:39.399> typical
