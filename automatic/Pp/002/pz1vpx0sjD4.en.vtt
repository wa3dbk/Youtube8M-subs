00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:15.450
 they already have a hellishly sharp 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.369
 shield certain Thomas von Ledebur 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.410
 do that regularly and meanwhile 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.410
 he has his own lush chilli collection 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.610
 home automation can be controlled centrally 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:30.259
 become what with so-called bussystems what 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.259
 is possible and what pays off 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.480
 and Sabine Zessin has conjured up again 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:38.190
 And she sells wintry sadness 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:41.590
 with gloriously blooming two balls 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.880
 man from south america the 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.440
 powder puff shrub with it we are 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.880
 right at the right continent for our 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.800
 next topic is also here 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.980
 sharp chillies and can 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:55.630
 addictive 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:57.610
 Mary worldwide loves spicy food 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.920
 And in this country, there are more and more 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:03.820
 Fans of hot chilli products too 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.800
 thomas von ledebur owns them 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.180
 is sharp since about 20 years there 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.280
 there is no court where no 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.270
 chili comes in with it's already 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.400
 to become a real addiction 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.250
 meanwhile and of course it works too 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.900
 always a bit sharper 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.150
 not only finished products arrive here 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.150
 Thomas has been building the table for years 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.520
 ledebur also own chilis 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.170
 Growing chilies is around 40 in the trend 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.690
 The Upper Bavarian has plants outside 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.850
 pots are for example the purple 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.500
 taiga with the purple stripes 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.990
 the sharpness is about middle 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.420
 So rather range and six to seven 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.540
 of ten on the scale 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:43.090
 and yes, are rather fruity easy 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.980
 lemony in the taste that are here 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.890
 now about the hottest you have 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:50.170
 It's a session pot she calls 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.720
 Both a fruit should suffice 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.010
 to eat 7 heads to sharpen and that 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.520
 you can already see this regulation 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:59.430
 would have to look very dangerous so with 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.920
 which are not joking 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.930
 Thomas von Ledebur appreciates the variety 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.200
 he does not have a real favorite 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.270
 but a chili impressed especially 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.670
 as a cotter got the gift 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.990
 superski lense produces unusually 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.709
 many fruits the infamous 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:22.680
 habanero Senel sharpness 9 to 10 on the 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:25.680
 ten astana then comes already 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.110
 just the sharpness he burns 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.520
 more in the throat area so there are too 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.770
 which burn the back of the neck 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.690
 pretty strong that it's not like that anymore 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.000
 nice because it naturally already extremely hurt 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.970
 then doing so when it is in he mouth space 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.760
 Burn the burn in then pleasant 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.680
 that millions of people love for 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.020
 unloved is sheep you have to learn 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.690
 that no tears are flowing now 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.720
 from years of getting used to the alkaloid 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.790
 capsaicin causes the hellish 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.070
 burning most of it is located 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.890
 in the car already many cooks 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:01.820
 That's why the seeds are removed 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.820
 but rather mild 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.480
 the wilhelma in stuttgart from the 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.160
 late summer are in the 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.580
 zoological-botanical garden as well 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.680
 Focus on chilies Gardener harbors a stout 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.690
 and take care of it at its first 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.170
 encounter with devilishly sharp chilies 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:22.380
 There was still a lot of naivety about the game 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:25.380
 Europe has everything with this chocolate 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:29.459
 I have a fruitful to the unsuspecting 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:33.300
 bitten and more has from morning until 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:36.330
 burned the mouth at night and that has 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.459
 his curiosity has since sparked 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.030
 Gardener for the park visitors over 100 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.989
 chili varieties collected 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.630
 culinary but keeps rainer depp 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.700
 are respectful distance from him chilis 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.410
 the sweet peppers prefer the actually 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.910
 nothing else is harmless 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.830
 Breeds of sharp chilies 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.830
 originated about 200 years ago 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.920
 The real chilies, on the other hand, are found in 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.450
 South America has been around for 7000 years 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.300
 the indios use 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.670
 the variety is enormously special 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:11.420
 decorative lantern-like jocks 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:13.400
 similar to the bishop caps who himself 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:17.840
 chilis wants to breed for the rainer 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:20.950
 Depp a tip to the hobby cup device 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:24.980
 I started very early in the year 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:27.380
 at the end of february you have that 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.890
 There is no time to worry about seeds 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.750
 to lose 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:32.000
 best immediately in special 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.040
 Shocking look with one 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.150
 spray atomizer and evenly 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.220
 Keep moist and warm 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:40.310
 The germination can last up to five weeks 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.560
 after that, every little plant needs 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:47.320
 his own pot with vigorously fertilized 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.320
 potting chilies are strong counter 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.820
 the plants are allowed to go out into the open air 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.250
 In the middle of May, big pots are ideal 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.990
 or boxes just do not support 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:59.180
 so that the shoots do not break off 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.610
 the harvest starts from july august and 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.320
 ends with the first frost thomas von 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.540
 Ledebur looks for his plants every few years 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.430
 days after maturity fruits if he has 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:09.590
 They immediately pick the rest 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.690
 still green pods better supplied and 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:13.820
 Change the color faster 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:17.710
 have matured sharp chillies 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.710
 experience shows the best aroma 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.570
 sharp chilis from south america
