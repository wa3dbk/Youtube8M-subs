unlike my run three screen which is
where<00:00:17.220> I<00:00:17.279> have<00:00:17.400> all<00:00:17.520> my<00:00:17.550> guidance<00:00:18.000> settings<00:00:18.359> I

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
where I have all my guidance settings I

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.500 
where I have all my guidance settings I
can<00:00:20.220> control<00:00:20.550> my<00:00:20.699> guidance<00:00:21.000> from<00:00:21.150> here<00:00:21.359> but

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510

going<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:31.859> store<00:00:32.130> that<00:00:32.160> guidance<00:00:32.640> line<00:00:32.880> in

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
going to store that guidance line in

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.750 
going to store that guidance line in
each<00:00:33.540> field<00:00:33.899> so<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:34.800> am<00:00:35.219> in<00:00:35.340> this<00:00:35.460> particular

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
guidance line set and when I do that I

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.549 
guidance line set and when I do that I
have<00:00:38.910> this<00:00:39.090> swath<00:00:39.390> select<00:00:39.930> that<00:00:40.110> I<00:00:40.200> can<00:00:40.379> put<00:00:40.530> on

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
same and we're really zoomed out here

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.700 
same and we're really zoomed out here
and<00:01:53.369> let<00:01:53.460> me<00:01:53.490> see<00:01:53.729> if<00:01:53.819> I<00:01:53.940> can<00:01:54.149> zoom<00:01:54.179> in<00:01:54.590> a<00:01:55.590> little

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
and let me see if I can zoom in a little

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.580 
and let me see if I can zoom in a little
bit

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.469 

there<00:02:01.159> we<00:02:01.310> can<00:02:01.460> see<00:02:01.640> our<00:02:01.759> guidance<00:02:02.090> lines<00:02:02.329> of

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
line blue so that is my curve one that

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.820 
line blue so that is my curve one that
one<00:02:10.789> is<00:02:10.819> kji

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
one is kji

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.400

this one over here is my mu and this one
here<00:02:15.680> is<00:02:15.830> my<00:02:16.010> straight<00:02:16.370> one<00:02:16.580> so<00:02:17.180> then<00:02:17.390> I<00:02:17.510> can
