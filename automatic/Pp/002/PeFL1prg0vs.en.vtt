 extra cristian welcome to the room 

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.429
 episode of the top 5 of halo 4 where is 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.230
 week corresponds to the ninjas and 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.490
 matrix so let's start with the 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.050
 top and let's see what were the 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.889
 best plays that they sent me to 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.889
 this top 5 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.619
 Y 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.360
 at number 5 comes gamer 7 where he pulls 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.460
 its on m &amp; r on the map of hey come and good 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.810
 here kills someone normal here sees that 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.880
 they are shooting him backwards he makes a 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.410
 I jump back and it makes a ninja 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.029
 perfect this guy wants to do to 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.010
 this type of trading but the guy left 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.780
 very to the left then at the end it 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.670
 makes a deserved array of that kind and 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.090
 at the end nothing else kills this with a 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.860
 murder by leaving him doing two girls and 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.730
 a followed matrix is perfect for 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.730
 gamer 7 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:57.000
 at number 4 will arrive barker xxx 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.590
 where is here on the heaven map 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.420
 also and see a guy who is going up 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.940
 by the elevator it makes a matrix 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.860
 perfect leaving him doing his murder 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.500
 aerial here we see once again how it goes up to 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.210
 the base to wait for the guy to go up 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.729
 the elevator just see that it is 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.560
 jumping rotates 180 degrees and murders him 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.500
 directly to make your pay here 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.490
 final well-deserved for willie parker and 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.490
 sorry if I pronounce it wrong 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.480
 and in the number 3 comes to lend 0 5 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.220
 where he pulls out his adhesive detonator he does not 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.710
 gives because I activate your shield then here 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.930
 makes him an excellent matrix by jumping his 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.730
 shield and making him a murder 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.710
 deserved here we see how he throws the 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.450
 grenade this guy activates his shield the 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.850
 Fury then comes at full speed 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.220
 Prostar makes a perfect jump to 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.530
 make the matrix to this guy so 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:51.050
 how he taught us to bet to take care of us 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.050
 of the types with perfect escudito 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.250
 and number 2 arrives again will 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.590
 barker where it is the same on the map 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.750
 jÃ¡iber but this time he made a matrix to 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.429
 so blind is without radar without anything here 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.530
 we see once again how he did it again 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.360
 only with the pure instincts saw 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.130
 how the enemy approached made him a 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.780
 hugs in the back crossing the 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.460
 wall and making it a good matrix 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.460
 deserved for wil barker 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.950
 and who will be at number 1 like that is 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.049
 we have george spartan where he gets his 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.760
 gun of fury here wants to kill 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:34.650
 this shake finally kills him gives him a 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.540
 small activate and good time to be 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.010
 approach someone by radar only 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.080
 what he's going to do is hide here 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.420
 side of the house and it's going to be that 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.269
 is going to be george spartan going to give a 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.400
 ninja 360 well deserved for this guy 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:49.410
 along with an aerial murder we see there 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.629
 how I kill him with the gun and 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.879
 curiously it is the same one that does the 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:55.319
 ninja at the end here we see how he kills him and 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:57.720
 in the distance we will see how it is that 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.760
 reappears the same guy just wanted 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.730
 look for revenge for them spartan but 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.970
 he did not leave the floor his deserved line 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.700
 360 to the m book here we see once again 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.879
 how it turns this milkshake and gives it its 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.780
 deserved ninja this kind excellent for 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:14.780
 george spartan 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.690

 several maps and makes a succession of 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.720

 girls and matrix in about two clips that 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.680
