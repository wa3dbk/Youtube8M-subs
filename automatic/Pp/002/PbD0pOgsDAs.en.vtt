harder<00:00:12.570> when<00:00:13.230> i<00:00:13.259> go<00:00:13.410> through<00:00:13.590> them<00:00:13.710> and<00:00:13.830> show

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
harder when i go through them and show

harder when i go through them and show
you<00:00:14.099> how<00:00:14.160> I<00:00:14.280> did<00:00:15.470> you<00:00:16.470> might<00:00:16.619> just<00:00:16.740> learn

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
you how I did you might just learn

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:27.679 
you how I did you might just learn
something

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.960 

round<00:00:28.689> one<00:00:28.869> fairly<00:00:29.500> easy<00:00:29.710> just<00:00:30.610> want<00:00:30.789> to<00:00:30.849> wait

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:30.970 
round one fairly easy just want to wait

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.159 
round one fairly easy just want to wait
till<00:00:31.090> these<00:00:31.210> out<00:00:31.420> Lawson<00:00:31.810> on<00:00:31.900> the<00:00:31.990> Marines

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:32.169 
till these out Lawson on the Marines

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:34.470 
till these out Lawson on the Marines
that<00:00:32.230> you<00:00:32.349> just<00:00:32.470> don't<00:00:32.590> move<00:00:32.739> it<00:00:32.890> around<00:00:33.480> then

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 
that you just don't move it around then

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.030 
that you just don't move it around then
you<00:00:34.540> have<00:00:34.690> to<00:00:34.780> keep<00:00:34.870> it<00:00:35.020> very<00:00:35.110> wide<00:00:35.379> arc<00:00:38.040> and

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.040 
you have to keep it very wide arc and

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.260 
you have to keep it very wide arc and
show<00:00:39.489> you<00:00:39.550> what<00:00:39.640> happened<00:00:39.879> so<00:00:40.030> I'll<00:00:40.120> make<00:00:40.239> a

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:40.270 
show you what happened so I'll make a

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.990 
show you what happened so I'll make a
char<00:00:40.989> pattern<00:00:41.260> and<00:00:41.410> I<00:00:41.440> get<00:00:41.559> hit<00:00:42.000> that's

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000 
char pattern and I get hit that's

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.460 
char pattern and I get hit that's
because<00:00:43.300> solids<00:00:43.720> and<00:00:43.930> rinse<00:00:44.110> have<00:00:44.230> the<00:00:44.290> same

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:44.470 
because solids and rinse have the same

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:45.680 
because solids and rinse have the same
movement<00:00:44.739> speed<00:00:44.890> without<00:00:44.980> stove<00:00:45.309> under<00:00:45.519> there

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
movement speed without stove under there

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:58.079 
movement speed without stove under there
so<00:00:46.690> just<00:00:46.839> keep<00:00:47.019> moving<00:00:47.199> around<00:00:56.879> this<00:00:57.879> one's

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:58.089 
so just keep moving around this one's

00:00:58.089 --> 00:00:59.009 
so just keep moving around this one's
actually<00:00:58.180> slightly<00:00:58.510> easier<00:00:58.720> because

00:00:59.009 --> 00:00:59.019 
actually slightly easier because

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:00.509 
actually slightly easier because
stalkers<00:00:59.530> have<00:00:59.589> a<00:00:59.650> faster<00:01:00.010> movement<00:01:00.309> speed

00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:00.519 
stalkers have a faster movement speed

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:03.149 
stalkers have a faster movement speed
then<00:01:00.790> zealots<00:01:01.659> do<00:01:01.839> I<00:01:02.019> know<00:01:02.710> you<00:01:02.799> just<00:01:02.920> have<00:01:03.010> in

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:03.159 
then zealots do I know you just have in

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:07.109 
then zealots do I know you just have in
route<00:01:03.369> and<00:01:03.580> hit<00:01:03.670> s<00:01:03.909> or<00:01:04.860> more<00:01:05.860> positions<00:01:06.280> or<00:01:06.729> you

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.119 
route and hit s or more positions or you

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:08.520 
route and hit s or more positions or you
actually<00:01:07.270> physically<00:01:07.810> target<00:01:08.170> as<00:01:08.260> element

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
actually physically target as element

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:09.780 
actually physically target as element
you<00:01:08.590> want<00:01:08.619> you're<00:01:09.250> gonna<00:01:09.369> be<00:01:09.460> careful<00:01:09.729> you

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
you want you're gonna be careful you

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:10.950 
you want you're gonna be careful you
don't<00:01:09.909> hit<00:01:10.060> the<00:01:10.210> ground<00:01:10.360> near<00:01:10.479> the<00:01:10.570> by<00:01:10.750> the<00:01:10.810> way

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
don't hit the ground near the by the way

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.730 
don't hit the ground near the by the way
as<00:01:11.020> you<00:01:11.229> can<00:01:11.530> hit<00:01:13.350> actually<00:01:14.350> find<00:01:14.500> this<00:01:14.590> is

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
as you can hit actually find this is

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.310 
as you can hit actually find this is
easier<00:01:15.189> if<00:01:15.460> you<00:01:15.720> start<00:01:16.720> moving<00:01:16.810> your<00:01:16.960> stalkers

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
easier if you start moving your stalkers

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.660 
easier if you start moving your stalkers
again<00:01:17.530> when<00:01:17.740> you<00:01:17.830> hear<00:01:18.010> the<00:01:18.100> sound<00:01:18.369> of<00:01:18.520> the

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
again when you hear the sound of the

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.999 
again when you hear the sound of the
laser

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:30.820 

that's<00:01:26.009> what<00:01:26.100> gets<00:01:26.189> me<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.460> best<00:01:26.579> results

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.160 

want<00:01:31.520> to<00:01:31.580> be<00:01:31.640> careful<00:01:31.670> it<00:01:31.910> again<00:01:32.090> stuff<00:01:32.270> if<00:01:32.990> you

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
want to be careful it again stuff if you

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.160 
want to be careful it again stuff if you
miss<00:01:34.010> micro<00:01:34.430> and<00:01:34.640> your<00:01:35.030> stalker<00:01:35.690> start<00:01:35.960> to<00:01:36.050> get

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
really low on HP for some reason you can

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.050 
really low on HP for some reason you can
just<00:01:38.780> run<00:01:39.110> it<00:01:39.290> for<00:01:39.500> a<00:01:39.530> while<00:01:39.740> and<00:01:40.060> they'll

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
just run it for a while and they'll

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.670 
just run it for a while and they'll
regenerate<00:01:41.480> education<00:01:41.960> we<00:01:42.050> used<00:01:42.500> to<00:01:42.560> do<00:01:42.650> that

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.320 

right<00:02:01.430> so<00:02:01.580> obviously<00:02:01.790> this<00:02:01.880> one's<00:02:02.090> about<00:02:02.180> the

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
zelich choke you just want to move them

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.969 
zelich choke you just want to move them
into<00:02:04.370> the<00:02:04.490> choke<00:02:04.700> and<00:02:04.850> press<00:02:05.150> H<00:02:08.679> and<00:02:09.679> as<00:02:09.860> L

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
into the choke and press H and as L

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.770 
into the choke and press H and as L
should<00:02:10.160> do<00:02:10.220> all<00:02:10.310> the<00:02:10.399> work<00:02:10.550> for<00:02:10.580> you<00:02:10.789> is<00:02:11.510> turn

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
the back you can just sort of ran with

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.990 
the back you can just sort of ran with
the<00:02:13.040> position<00:02:13.400> with<00:02:13.550> when<00:02:13.670> they're<00:02:13.790> going<00:02:13.940> to

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
the position with when they're going to

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.940 
the position with when they're going to
take<00:02:14.300> over<00:02:14.570> the<00:02:14.600> one<00:02:14.720> of<00:02:14.840> those<00:02:14.990> are

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.740 

it's<00:02:19.430> all<00:02:19.550> about<00:02:19.580> just<00:02:19.879> 90<00:02:20.120> seconds<00:02:20.569> get<00:02:20.660> us

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
it's all about just 90 seconds get us

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.390 
it's all about just 90 seconds get us
around

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.399 

at<00:02:23.849> this<00:02:24.120> point<00:02:24.329> you<00:02:24.629> can<00:02:24.720> just<00:02:24.900> a<00:02:25.019> move<00:02:25.230> them

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:25.409 
at this point you can just a move them

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:26.869 
at this point you can just a move them
just<00:02:25.739> so<00:02:25.890> that<00:02:25.920> you<00:02:26.129> want<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.489> back<00:02:26.640> down

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
just so that you want to the back down

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:37.940 
just so that you want to the back down
to<00:02:27.060> you<00:02:27.799> doing<00:02:28.799> damage<00:02:36.500> right<00:02:37.500> obviously<00:02:37.890> this

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
to you doing damage right obviously this

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.099 
to you doing damage right obviously this
one's<00:02:38.129> about<00:02:38.220> focus<00:02:38.849> fine<00:02:39.060> its<00:02:39.750> use<00:02:39.900> for<00:02:39.930> our

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:40.109 
one's about focus fine its use for our

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:42.050 
one's about focus fine its use for our
attack<00:02:40.170> on<00:02:40.620> one<00:02:41.250> zealot<00:02:41.549> and<00:02:41.760> then<00:02:41.909> you're

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
attack on one zealot and then you're

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.500 
attack on one zealot and then you're
gonna<00:02:42.120> shift<00:02:42.390> my<00:02:42.510> like<00:02:42.659> that<00:02:44.269> they<00:02:45.269> should<00:02:45.420> all

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
gonna shift my like that they should all

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.759 
gonna shift my like that they should all
just<00:02:45.750> kill<00:02:45.989> them<00:02:46.049> without<00:02:46.230> having<00:02:46.439> to<00:02:46.500> move<00:02:46.620> it

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
just kill them without having to move it

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.520 
just kill them without having to move it
you<00:02:47.340> can't<00:02:47.519> micro<00:02:47.849> them<00:02:48.000> but<00:02:48.379> probably<00:02:49.379> just

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
you can't micro them but probably just

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:55.759 
you can't micro them but probably just
easier<00:02:49.680> if<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.700> AI<00:02:50.790> do<00:02:50.939> it<00:02:54.200> as<00:02:55.200> hydrolysis<00:02:55.650> so

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
easier if the AI do it as hydrolysis so

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:07.110 
easier if the AI do it as hydrolysis so
slow

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.490 

rights<00:03:08.120> over<00:03:08.390> this<00:03:08.540> one's<00:03:08.750> about<00:03:08.870> moving<00:03:09.410> the

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
rights over this one's about moving the

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.170 
rights over this one's about moving the
store<00:03:09.740> for<00:03:09.830> a<00:03:09.890> deranged<00:03:10.280> when<00:03:10.610> it's<00:03:10.760> about<00:03:11.120> to

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
store for a deranged when it's about to

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.450 
store for a deranged when it's about to
die<00:03:11.330> but<00:03:11.840> then<00:03:11.900> as<00:03:12.200> soon<00:03:12.290> as<00:03:12.410> it's<00:03:12.560> untargeted

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:13.460 
die but then as soon as it's untargeted

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:14.770 
die but then as soon as it's untargeted
by<00:03:13.580> the<00:03:13.640> spine<00:03:14.120> quality<00:03:14.390> when<00:03:14.480> i<00:03:14.510> sent<00:03:14.660> it<00:03:14.720> back

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
by the spine quality when i sent it back

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.000 
by the spine quality when i sent it back
in<00:03:14.930> which<00:03:15.020> you're<00:03:15.110> gonna<00:03:15.230> need<00:03:15.320> the<00:03:15.440> dps<00:03:15.770> to

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
in which you're gonna need the dps to

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:35.830 
in which you're gonna need the dps to
kill<00:03:16.580> it<00:03:16.700> in<00:03:16.790> the<00:03:16.880> end

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.420 

so<00:03:36.840> I<00:03:36.900> just<00:03:37.020> about<00:03:37.380> Barney's<00:03:37.920> just<00:03:38.160> move<00:03:38.310> them

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
so I just about Barney's just move them

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.760 
so I just about Barney's just move them
onto<00:03:38.550> the<00:03:38.640> path<00:03:38.850> of<00:03:38.880> the<00:03:39.320> Greensboro<00:03:40.320> and<00:03:40.440> wait

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 
onto the path of the Greensboro and wait

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:49.250 
onto the path of the Greensboro and wait
to<00:03:41.220> spring<00:03:41.580> a<00:03:41.670> trap

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.990 

you<00:03:49.830> never<00:03:50.010> know<00:03:50.250> try<00:03:50.519> and<00:03:50.640> fight<00:03:50.760> for<00:03:50.939> the

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
you never know try and fight for the

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.149 
you never know try and fight for the
silence<00:03:51.330> because<00:03:51.689> I<00:03:51.810> just<00:03:51.870> don't<00:03:52.590> energy<00:03:53.040> for

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:53.159 
silence because I just don't energy for

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:54.350 
silence because I just don't energy for
just<00:03:53.280> like<00:03:53.370> a<00:03:53.400> lot<00:03:53.579> of<00:03:53.670> target<00:03:53.970> since<00:03:54.120> it's<00:03:54.299> a

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
just like a lot of target since it's a

00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:05.809 
just like a lot of target since it's a
quick<00:04:04.129> actually<00:04:05.129> this<00:04:05.189> is<00:04:05.340> a<00:04:05.370> no<00:04:05.549> range

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
quick actually this is a no range

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:07.789 
quick actually this is a no range
Colossus<00:04:06.390> so<00:04:06.720> you<00:04:06.780> just<00:04:06.930> want<00:04:07.110> to<00:04:07.200> stay<00:04:07.650> right

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
Colossus so you just want to stay right

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:10.399 
Colossus so you just want to stay right
next<00:04:07.890> to<00:04:08.040> the<00:04:08.099> cliff<00:04:08.280> move<00:04:08.670> down<00:04:08.940> and<00:04:09.409> they

00:04:10.399 --> 00:04:10.409 
next to the cliff move down and they

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:11.569 
next to the cliff move down and they
should<00:04:10.560> all<00:04:10.650> get<00:04:10.769> into<00:04:10.890> the<00:04:11.010> right<00:04:11.129> channel<00:04:11.280> at

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
should all get into the right channel at

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:14.119 
should all get into the right channel at
some<00:04:11.730> point<00:04:11.970> and<00:04:12.780> then<00:04:12.959> you<00:04:13.049> can<00:04:13.230> just<00:04:13.409> shoot

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:14.129 
some point and then you can just shoot

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:15.800 
some point and then you can just shoot
away<00:04:14.280> you<00:04:14.819> can't<00:04:15.000> focus<00:04:15.180> fire<00:04:15.420> on<00:04:15.450> the<00:04:15.569> larger

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
away you can't focus fire on the larger

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.270 
away you can't focus fire on the larger
clumps<00:04:16.139> if<00:04:16.289> you<00:04:16.380> want<00:04:16.560> but<00:04:16.859> it's<00:04:16.979> easy<00:04:17.160> enough

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
clumps if you want but it's easy enough

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:46.480 
clumps if you want but it's easy enough
just<00:04:17.609> to<00:04:17.989> move<00:04:18.989> it<00:04:19.079> like<00:04:19.169> this

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.649 

when<00:04:47.490> I<00:04:47.520> get<00:04:47.669> inside<00:04:47.879> the<00:04:48.000> sea<00:04:48.300> changsha

00:04:48.649 --> 00:04:48.659 
when I get inside the sea changsha

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:50.839 
when I get inside the sea changsha
minimum<00:04:48.930> range<00:04:49.159> and<00:04:50.159> bring<00:04:50.460> them<00:04:50.580> here<00:04:50.669> it's<00:04:50.819> a

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:50.849 
minimum range and bring them here it's a

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:54.290 
minimum range and bring them here it's a
bit<00:04:52.340> that'll<00:04:53.340> make<00:04:53.400> this<00:04:53.520> a<00:04:53.669> chance<00:04:53.879> to<00:04:54.090> focus

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
bit that'll make this a chance to focus

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.800 
bit that'll make this a chance to focus
on<00:04:54.629> each<00:04:54.689> other<00:04:55.969> just<00:04:56.969> move<00:04:57.120> into<00:04:57.300> the<00:04:57.389> Earth's

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
on each other just move into the Earth's

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:14.570 
on each other just move into the Earth's
a<00:04:58.409> spot<00:04:58.650> and<00:04:58.830> just<00:04:58.889> went<00:04:59.400> to<00:04:59.610> look<00:04:59.669> as<00:04:59.849> it

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.450 

Ryan<00:05:15.210> some<00:05:15.389> of<00:05:15.479> the<00:05:15.539> fire<00:05:15.720> one<00:05:16.069> its<00:05:17.069> power<00:05:17.250> this

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
Ryan some of the fire one its power this

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:18.649 
Ryan some of the fire one its power this
one<00:05:17.610> and<00:05:17.819> as<00:05:17.939> soon<00:05:18.000> as<00:05:18.120> you<00:05:18.180> borrowed<00:05:18.479> you<00:05:18.569> can

00:05:18.649 --> 00:05:18.659 
one and as soon as you borrowed you can

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:20.719 
one and as soon as you borrowed you can
actually<00:05:18.750> bring<00:05:19.020> it<00:05:19.139> back<00:05:19.229> up<00:05:19.639> when<00:05:20.639> you

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:20.729 
actually bring it back up when you

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:22.189 
actually bring it back up when you
borrow<00:05:21.000> the<00:05:21.240> second<00:05:21.629> one<00:05:21.720> you<00:05:21.900> want<00:05:22.020> to<00:05:22.080> make

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:22.199 
borrow the second one you want to make

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:23.270 
borrow the second one you want to make
sure<00:05:22.229> these<00:05:22.439> two<00:05:22.620> bar<00:05:22.800> at<00:05:22.860> the<00:05:22.889> same<00:05:23.069> time

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
sure these two bar at the same time

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.459 
sure these two bar at the same time
otherwise<00:05:23.819> it<00:05:24.569> might<00:05:24.719> switch<00:05:25.020> that<00:05:25.319> one

00:05:25.459 --> 00:05:25.469 
otherwise it might switch that one

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:27.860 
otherwise it might switch that one
quickly<00:05:25.849> now<00:05:26.849> obviously<00:05:27.389> this<00:05:27.449> one<00:05:27.599> does<00:05:27.750> have

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
quickly now obviously this one does have

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.510 
quickly now obviously this one does have
a<00:05:27.930> timer<00:05:28.590> but<00:05:28.860> it's<00:05:28.949> fairly<00:05:29.159> long<00:05:29.340> so<00:05:29.460> you

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
a timer but it's fairly long so you

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.499 
a timer but it's fairly long so you
actually<00:05:29.639> went<00:05:29.849> to<00:05:29.939> the<00:05:30.030> bunker<00:05:30.270> starts

burning<00:05:30.719> and<00:05:31.020> then<00:05:31.139> just<00:05:32.479> equate<00:05:33.479> to<00:05:33.509> your

00:05:33.709 --> 00:05:33.719 
burning and then just equate to your

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:36.800 
burning and then just equate to your
room<00:05:33.870> the<00:05:34.590> monkey<00:05:34.830> Lu<00:05:34.919> damages<00:05:35.400> itself<00:05:35.810> I'm

and then this one because that way they
should<00:05:40.289> be<00:05:40.439> focused<00:05:40.860> on<00:05:40.979> bin<00:05:41.400> lorry<00:05:41.550> to
