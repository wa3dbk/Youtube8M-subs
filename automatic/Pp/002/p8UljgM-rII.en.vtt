00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 hello girls and guys fans of 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.950
 monster guy in this video I bring you the 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.810
 tutorial on how to make a costume for 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.809
 your fears we are going to make a disguise of 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.700
 skeleton let's start let's occupy a 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.940
 patch of fabric in black I have 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.400
 I wait cut trapeze way I'll go 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.130
 to give the referential measures 14 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.340
 centimeters at the top in the 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:27.410
 base of the trapeze I used 19 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:31.470
 and a half centimeters long and have 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:33.989
 considered 25 centimeters but then 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.940
 This may vary depending on who you 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.200
 do the disguise is to a girl or a 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.510
 boy and I considered this mid cut 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.629
 length of his legs and position proceeded to 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.900
 simply cut it marks the length of 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.230
 the leg 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:54.260
 and then you fold it in half the fabric and 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:57.170
 proceeds to make the cut now what 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:00.140
 I'm going to do is I'm going to fold a 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:03.559
 piece of fabric out 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:06.830
 and I will proceed to dial with the help 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.479
 the doll is already bent a piece 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.360
 of cloth here because when assembling 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.790
 the disguise this has to be 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.750
 enough fabric to climb up to the 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.970
 Top of the doll 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.060
 and then what I'm going to do here is mark 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.620
 this to sew the legs and trim 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.820
 the excess fabric to form the 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.400
 disguise pants 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.850
 I finished sewing both legs like 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:34.100
 you can observe now also trimmed 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.140
 the excess fabric I recommend you not 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.990
 do the vandal neither very stuck nor very 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.570
 loose I'm going to put him right and I'm going to 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.900
 proceed to finish the top of 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.430
 our disguise 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.530
 now I have placed the costume or the doll 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.650
 bent a bit the fabric in the part 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:53.260
 top with a marker made a line 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.890
 that I will proceed to cut 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:59.230
 and I'm going to upload the top one to mark 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.750
 the fabric accesses that I'm going to cut out and 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:04.450
 to measure what will be the sleeves of 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.640
 this disguise and cut the sides 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.790
 for the sleeves for the exit of the 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:14.110
 arms now I have folded the fabric towards 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:16.930
 inside and I marked in the height of the 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.420
 shoulders with a chalk marker now what 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.600
 what I'm going to do is double this by the 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:26.230
 half and with the help of the scissors I'm going to 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:29.790
 make a small cut here to give 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:33.000
 a round neck to our disguise 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.769
 I already cut the fabric here to do the 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.599
 Round neck trimmed excesses 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.010
 also that I stayed now 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:40.859
 just what I'm going to do is join 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.709
 you are those parts to form the part 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:45.670
 superior of the disguise and we're going to proceed 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:49.480
 to make the sleeves 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.459
 already almost the shoulders both shoulders and 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.220
 Now I'm going to take a double cloth for 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:57.390
 make the sleeves and cut this that is going to 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.550
 be the manga make sure very well that he 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.370
 the arm of your wrist fits 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:05.190
 perfectly fold it in two and proceed 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.819
 that sew before joining it to the body 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.740
 of the disguise 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:14.400
 make sure you fit in your doll and then 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:17.280
 now we are going to join him here to the arm of 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.080
 disguise and then we will proceed to paste the 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.140
 Velcro or sew Velcro on the part 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.360
 later to unify the sleeves of your 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.890
 disguise to the body of the disguise what 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.890
 you have to do is put the sleeve to 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:32.400
 right you put it through the hole 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:35.130
 body of the disguise that is for the for 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.970
 your arms and you'll meet here in all 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.600
 contour 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:43.100
 so that it stays like this 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:46.670
 then I will continue cooking here 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:48.920
 and the sleeves will be attached to my disguise 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.470
 now we just need to sew the 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.630
 back and decorate to sew the 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.480
 part of the hip you have to pull the 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.849
 fabric so that too much fabric does not gather 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.580
 go ahead and you're going to harass him until 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:04.790
 height of the waist and then in the part 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.500
 posterior or superior pinch to see 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.200
 exactly where are you going to place the 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.060
 Velcro 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.920
 already stick with the help of silicone 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.269
 hot velcro because you can sew 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.340
 seeing that it is a bit difficult so 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:16.780
 I just hit it and now I'm going to proceed 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.959
 to decorate for this I will use 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.579
 felt in white or cream I do not 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.410
 I have white at that time I have this 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:25.090
 that has decoration but next 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:28.979
 opposite is white so I'm going to use 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:32.830
 this you are going to make two rectangles 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:34.720
 thin and you'll try to get it before 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.000
 of the knee and before the hip and you go 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.979
 to proceed to stick it with silicone 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.060
 hot you are going to make two more bones 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:44.979
 thin for this part of the leg and 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.960
 let's finish doing also the 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:49.090
 rest of the decoration I'm already 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.790
 finishing decorating my costume made 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.810
 here some bones for the arms not 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:56.290
 thinner than the other for the 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.790
 forearm one longer for the arm I have 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.620
 done this kind of butterfly for 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:02.919
 do the hip bone and the fact 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.270
 two holes here here place two more and 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:07.630
 the important thing is the spine 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:11.139
 made a thin strip to which I have 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:13.310
 cut small pieces and I'm going to 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:15.260
 put a few 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.600
 strips to simulate which are the 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.220
 ribs I'm not going to put it much because 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.980
 I do not want my costume to get too 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:24.380
 recharged and I show you at the end I'll 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.820
 hit it get with the hot this 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:28.790
 it's the final result I hope you
