might<00:01:41.270> need<00:01:41.479> to<00:01:41.630> be<00:01:41.750> a<00:01:41.780> bit<00:01:41.930> of<00:01:42.080> stronger<00:01:42.800> color

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:44.649 
might need to be a bit of stronger color

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:47.460 
might need to be a bit of stronger color
so<00:01:45.649> I'll<00:01:45.770> add<00:01:45.920> a<00:01:45.950> bit<00:01:46.160> more<00:01:46.190> of<00:01:46.430> the<00:01:46.670> scarlet

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.040 
so I'll add a bit more of the scarlet
and<00:01:48.850> perhaps<00:01:49.850> a<00:01:50.119> little<00:01:50.210> bit<00:01:50.479> of<00:01:50.600> yellow<00:01:50.780> as

well

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.930 

yes<00:02:18.770> that's<00:02:18.980> better<00:02:21.130> these<00:02:22.130> small<00:02:22.490> amounts

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
yes that's better these small amounts

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.410 
yes that's better these small amounts
need<00:02:23.180> applying<00:02:23.990> rather<00:02:24.320> carefully<00:02:25.420> because

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
need applying rather carefully because

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.840 
need applying rather carefully because
as<00:02:26.690> I<00:02:26.810> said<00:02:27.050> the<00:02:27.170> material<00:02:27.710> runs<00:02:27.980> only<00:02:28.460> slowly

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
as I said the material runs only slowly

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.750 
as I said the material runs only slowly

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
if you put too little on it can be a bit

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.810 
if you put too little on it can be a bit
frustrating<00:02:32.710> but<00:02:33.710> if<00:02:33.860> you<00:02:33.950> put<00:02:34.160> too<00:02:34.190> much<00:02:34.550> on

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
frustrating but if you put too much on

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.490 
frustrating but if you put too much on
it's<00:02:35.000> difficult<00:02:35.390> to<00:02:35.570> stop<00:02:35.780> it<00:02:35.960> flowing<00:02:36.380> off

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
it's difficult to stop it flowing off

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.460 
it's difficult to stop it flowing off
the<00:02:36.530> cocktail<00:02:37.100> stick<00:02:37.630> as<00:02:38.630> you<00:02:38.930> take<00:02:39.170> it<00:02:39.320> up
