00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:18.980
 hello youtube friends 255 and today they 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:21.800
 I bring from the game of real racing 2 for 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.779
 our devices the best and the e3 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.140
 okay 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:30.290
 well this game I was testing and 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.250
 creating for him to grab the the rom 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:35.610
 stock 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:38.820
 which is very difficult to grip games 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:42.380
 of this type although I'm still also 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:46.680
 with the real racing 3 that I could not 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:47.370
 find a solution for it and good the 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.190
 game 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.380
 I'll leave a link in the description of 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.550
 video that will be the pica file and the 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:58.680
 data that ok the data was going 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.840
 to our file pairs the one 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.659
 you have and well let's sd card 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.429
 android 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.429
 and to data ok 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:16.240
 this is where we're going to paste the data 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:19.240
 of the game of racing 2 and good this 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:22.030
 it would be all for the data ok and now 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.970
 we would install the game apk file 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.310
 As you can see here I have it 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.990
 let's install and install it as 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.030
 any other application here 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:35.560
 I do not install because I already have the game and 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:39.460
 well as I said is something cracked 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.950
 the one tested at stake if it looks good to me 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:45.159
 taste looks good and well I have to 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:49.000
 say that I tried it on the series in English 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:51.539
 geimer in English and it did not work for me and what 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.670
 I tried also on this one which is the 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:56.350
 extreme stock I already uploaded it and already had 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.299
 uploaded he had already made video of the 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.880
 premieres extremist version 1 that 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:04.750
 it is also a rom based on the stock 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:07.090
 rom and good in this is how it worked for me and 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.660
 I also think it works in the we do 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:14.190
 in a 9 ok ok let's open the game 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.190
 or keep me here I have it 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.660
 and good to show them like that I do not have 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:24.390
 nothing connected or wifi though or 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.390
 they keep the game is running 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.700
 I 'm going to advance the video 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:41.450
 of the intro of the game and well you just have to 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.180
 wait for this to load us in their 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.580
 controls and ways of use are very 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.920
 basic especially because you have to 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:54.910
 have crushed you have to crush with 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.910
 the two fingers the side where it's going we're going to 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:02.040
 to give direction to the car ok 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:04.319
 and good if a review of the game I hope 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.370
 look at each other 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.370
 and let me focus 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.440
 well let's look 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:20.350
 the game starts roughly I think 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:24.780
 that a giga point 56 I do not remember no 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.780
 I remember very well if it is somewhat heavy 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:34.650
 as conserved gives us I have in another 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:34.650
 camera I will take the camera 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.620
 as I said the game is trancado I 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.830
 I no longer have I have applications 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.830
 open 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:11.420
 and I think here I've done that I'm going to stop 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.420
 a little the games 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:21.560
 and good friends this would be the whole game 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:25.840
 like the somewhat expensive label there 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.840
 you may have some 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.680
 in the treatments 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.350
 but that is normal of the game since the 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:38.570
 game is very difficult to get it that way 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:40.160
 like the one in the racing 3 that's good 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:44.210
 I'm looking for a way to get it 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:46.389
 the l3 and well we're going until the next 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.389
 video
