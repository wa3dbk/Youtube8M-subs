box down below to a to a quick
performance<00:00:32.189> video<00:00:32.430> I<00:00:32.460> think<00:00:32.550> it's<00:00:32.759> like

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
performance video I think it's like

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.850 
performance video I think it's like
fifty<00:00:33.210> seconds<00:00:33.570> long<00:00:33.719> or<00:00:33.870> something<00:00:34.020> so<00:00:34.800> you

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
fifty seconds long or something so you

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.470 
fifty seconds long or something so you
can<00:00:34.890> check<00:00:35.100> that<00:00:35.160> out<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.670> then<00:00:35.730> you'll<00:00:36.360> have

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
can check that out and then you'll have

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.900 
can check that out and then you'll have
a<00:00:36.540> better<00:00:36.840> understanding<00:00:37.559> of<00:00:37.649> how<00:00:37.800> how<00:00:38.730> this

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
a better understanding of how how this

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.819 
a better understanding of how how this
trick<00:00:39.120> works<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:40.350> timing<00:00:40.739> and

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
trick works and the timing and

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.580 
trick works and the timing and
everything<00:00:40.920> like<00:00:41.219> that<00:00:41.280> so<00:00:42.239> once<00:00:43.170> once<00:00:43.469> you've

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
everything like that so once once you've

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.080 
everything like that so once once you've
watched<00:00:43.800> that<00:00:43.980> let's<00:00:44.219> let's<00:00:44.520> continue<00:00:44.820> on

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
watched that let's let's continue on

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.639 
watched that let's let's continue on
with<00:00:45.390> how<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.170> do<00:00:46.379> it<00:00:46.700> so<00:00:47.700> your<00:00:48.239> setup<00:00:48.660> is<00:00:48.840> the

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
with how to do it so your setup is the

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.630 
with how to do it so your setup is the
four<00:00:49.860> aces<00:00:50.039> on<00:00:50.460> top<00:00:50.850> of<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.149> deck<00:00:52.430> okay<00:00:53.430> and

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
four aces on top of the deck okay and

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.150 
four aces on top of the deck okay and

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
you can start off with any series of

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.279 
you can start off with any series of
false<00:00:56.730> shuffles<00:00:57.239> or<00:00:57.510> false<00:00:57.750> cuts<00:00:58.050> that<00:00:58.199> you

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
false shuffles or false cuts that you

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.170 
false shuffles or false cuts that you
want<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.559> do<00:00:58.739> but<00:00:59.340> in<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.579> end<00:00:59.609> you<00:00:59.910> want<00:01:00.059> to

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180

any four cards as long as one of the
aces<00:01:24.869> isn't<00:01:25.200> touched<00:01:25.380> which<00:01:25.650> is<00:01:25.770> easy<00:01:25.950> because

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
aces isn't touched which is easy because

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.910

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
cards okay so that's that's pretty easy

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.620 
cards okay so that's that's pretty easy
to<00:01:38.009> do<00:01:38.220> as<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.610> close<00:01:38.850> up<00:01:39.060> you<00:01:39.210> kind<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.479> just

eyeball four cards from the top and you
can't<00:01:42.420> hear<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.750> little<00:01:42.869> break<00:01:43.259> right<00:01:43.470> there

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
can't hear the little break right there

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.120 
can't hear the little break right there

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.069 
and now you're going to say something
like<00:01:47.280> okay<00:01:47.790> let's<00:01:47.970> let's<00:01:48.329> take<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.600> look<00:01:48.869> at

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
like okay let's let's take a look at

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.800 
like okay let's let's take a look at
which<00:01:49.409> cards<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:49.979> touched<00:01:50.479> flip<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.600> take

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
which cards you touched flip you take

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.660 
which cards you touched flip you take
the<00:01:51.930> cards<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.290> flip<00:01:52.530> them<00:01:52.649> face<00:01:52.890> up<00:01:52.920> on<00:01:53.280> top

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
the cards you flip them face up on top

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.630 
the cards you flip them face up on top
of<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:53.939> deck<00:01:54.149> so<00:01:55.140> now<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.890> have<00:01:56.130> an<00:01:56.399> eight

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
of the deck so now you have an eight

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.050 
of the deck so now you have an eight
card<00:01:56.969> break<00:01:58.460> what<00:01:59.460> you're<00:01:59.579> going<00:01:59.700> to<00:01:59.729> do<00:01:59.880> next

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
card break what you're going to do next

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.990 
card break what you're going to do next
is<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.329> really<00:02:00.719> great<00:02:01.020> card<00:02:01.320> switch<00:02:01.590> it's

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
is a really great card switch it's

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.480 
is a really great card switch it's
invisible<00:02:03.000> it's<00:02:03.450> perfectly<00:02:04.200> justified<00:02:04.860> all

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
invisible it's perfectly justified all

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.160 
invisible it's perfectly justified all
that<00:02:05.820> good<00:02:06.000> stuff<00:02:06.180> so<00:02:06.420> what<00:02:06.899> you're<00:02:07.020> going<00:02:07.110> to

that good stuff so what you're going to

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.400 
that good stuff so what you're going to
do<00:02:07.290> is<00:02:07.409> lift<00:02:07.649> up<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.270> on<00:02:09.270> all<00:02:09.780> of<00:02:09.959> those<00:02:10.140> eight

do is lift up and on all of those eight

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.460 
do is lift up and on all of those eight
cards<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:11.190> a<00:02:11.220> card<00:02:11.670> packet

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.810 
cards the a card packet
some<00:02:13.680> of<00:02:13.800> you<00:02:13.920> might<00:02:14.040> be<00:02:14.250> slightly<00:02:14.520> nervous

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
some of you might be slightly nervous

some of you might be slightly nervous
about<00:02:15.170> holding<00:02:16.170> eight<00:02:16.350> cards<00:02:16.830> as<00:02:16.980> for

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
about holding eight cards as for

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.160 
about holding eight cards as for
currents<00:02:17.760> but<00:02:18.510> don't<00:02:18.690> worry<00:02:18.840> about<00:02:18.930> it

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
currents but don't worry about it

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.230 
currents but don't worry about it
because<00:02:19.620> it's<00:02:19.950> perfectly<00:02:20.340> covered<00:02:20.730> here's

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
because it's perfectly covered here's

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.040 
because it's perfectly covered here's
how<00:02:21.480> I<00:02:21.510> hold<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:21.990> packet<00:02:22.380> okay<00:02:23.600> so<00:02:24.600> I<00:02:24.720> have<00:02:24.900> my

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
how I hold the packet okay so I have my

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.600 
how I hold the packet okay so I have my
thumb<00:02:25.350> that's<00:02:25.590> covering<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.070> entire<00:02:26.340> back

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
thumb that's covering the entire back

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.760 
thumb that's covering the entire back
edge<00:02:26.820> I<00:02:27.090> have<00:02:27.540> my<00:02:27.720> fingers<00:02:28.230> which<00:02:28.650> are

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
edge I have my fingers which are

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.610

covering the entire front edge my right

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.260 
covering the entire front edge my right
hand<00:02:31.980> is<00:02:32.160> covering<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.550> right<00:02:32.670> edge<00:02:32.880> the<00:02:33.060> only

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
hand is covering the right edge the only

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.110 
hand is covering the right edge the only
exposed<00:02:33.690> angle<00:02:34.050> really<00:02:34.260> is<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:34.680> left<00:02:34.890> edge

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
exposed angle really is the left edge

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.290 
exposed angle really is the left edge
but<00:02:36.120> due<00:02:36.480> to<00:02:36.510> how<00:02:37.320> this<00:02:37.590> count<00:02:38.040> works<00:02:38.430> or<00:02:39.240> how

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
but due to how this count works or how

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.540 
but due to how this count works or how
the<00:02:39.480> switch<00:02:39.810> works<00:02:40.050> the<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:41.130> left<00:02:41.340> edge<00:02:41.520> is

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
the switch works the the left edge is

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.060 
the switch works the the left edge is
never<00:02:41.910> exposed<00:02:42.330> so<00:02:43.110> don't<00:02:43.500> don't<00:02:43.800> worry<00:02:43.950> at

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
never exposed so don't don't worry at

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.210 
never exposed so don't don't worry at
all<00:02:44.190> about<00:02:44.250> holding<00:02:44.760> such<00:02:45.090> a<00:02:45.120> thick<00:02:45.690> packet<00:02:46.220> so

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
all about holding such a thick packet so

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.820 
all about holding such a thick packet so
here's<00:02:47.430> here's<00:02:47.700> how<00:02:47.850> the<00:02:47.910> switch<00:02:48.090> works

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
here's here's how the switch works

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.880 
here's here's how the switch works
you're<00:02:49.830> going<00:02:49.950> to<00:02:50.010> be<00:02:50.130> switching<00:02:51.890> these

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
you're going to be switching these

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:53.930 
you're going to be switching these
you're<00:02:53.040> going<00:02:53.130> to<00:02:53.190> be<00:02:53.310> switching<00:02:53.490> these<00:02:53.670> cards

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
King of Hearts then after that third

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.420 
King of Hearts then after that third
card<00:03:15.450> you're<00:03:15.840> just<00:03:15.990> going<00:03:16.170> to<00:03:16.260> drop<00:03:17.220> the

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
card you're just going to drop the

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.880 
card you're just going to drop the
remaining<00:03:17.670> cards<00:03:18.090> right<00:03:18.209> on<00:03:18.360> top<00:03:18.600> and<00:03:18.840> you<00:03:19.680> say

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
remaining cards right on top and you say

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.680 
remaining cards right on top and you say

so your current situation now is these

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.650 
so your current situation now is these
three<00:03:29.400> cards<00:03:29.610> which<00:03:29.850> they<00:03:30.030> think<00:03:30.090> are<00:03:30.510> the

down<00:03:58.590> into<00:03:58.890> a<00:03:58.920> row<00:03:59.130> like<00:03:59.310> this<00:03:59.340> then<00:04:00.239> what<00:04:00.420> they

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
down into a row like this then what they

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.210 
down into a row like this then what they
do<00:04:00.570> is<00:04:00.750> they<00:04:00.900> take<00:04:01.260> the<00:04:01.530> car<00:04:01.709> that<00:04:01.860> they<00:04:01.980> just

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
do is they take the car that they just

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.400 
do is they take the car that they just

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
dealt on to the table back onto the deck

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.780 
dealt on to the table back onto the deck
and<00:04:05.330> then<00:04:06.330> they<00:04:07.250> separate<00:04:08.250> the<00:04:08.370> cards<00:04:08.670> from

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
and then they separate the cards from

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.580 
and then they separate the cards from
the<00:04:08.970> deck<00:04:09.000> so<00:04:09.540> that<00:04:09.570> whole<00:04:09.780> sequence<00:04:10.110> makes<00:04:10.410> no

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
the deck so that whole sequence makes no

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.979 
the deck so that whole sequence makes no

kind of combat the the fishiness of that
whole<00:04:19.739> situation<00:04:19.950> is<00:04:20.959> you<00:04:21.959> know<00:04:22.049> you<00:04:22.109> really

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
whole situation is you know you really

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.969 
whole situation is you know you really
what<00:04:22.590> you<00:04:22.680> need<00:04:22.830> is<00:04:22.979> a<00:04:23.010> way<00:04:23.400> to<00:04:23.460> justify

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:24.979 
what you need is a way to justify

00:04:30.559 --> 00:04:30.569 
separating it from the deck again so

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:33.230 
separating it from the deck again so
here's<00:04:30.960> how<00:04:31.080> I<00:04:31.110> do<00:04:31.229> it<00:04:31.410> after<00:04:32.099> I<00:04:32.430> finish<00:04:32.789> that

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
here's how I do it after I finish that

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.110

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
the tip onto the table so with one hand

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.420 
the tip onto the table so with one hand
or<00:04:42.419> even<00:04:42.780> I<00:04:42.930> could<00:04:43.080> use<00:04:43.199> my<00:04:43.349> my<00:04:43.919> right<00:04:44.130> hand<00:04:44.340> as

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
or even I could use my my right hand as

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.640 
or even I could use my my right hand as
well<00:04:44.550> I<00:04:44.759> deal<00:04:45.389> three<00:04:45.690> cards<00:04:45.720> onto<00:04:46.169> the<00:04:46.289> table

well I deal three cards onto the table
and<00:04:47.130> kind<00:04:47.250> of<00:04:47.370> a<00:04:47.430> messy<00:04:47.819> way<00:04:48.470> sloppy<00:04:49.470> kind<00:04:49.830> of

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:49.889 
and kind of a messy way sloppy kind of

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:54.110 
and kind of a messy way sloppy kind of
like<00:04:50.009> that<00:04:50.160> and<00:04:50.940> now<00:04:51.449> what<00:04:51.660> they<00:04:51.720> do<00:04:51.780> is<00:04:53.120> you

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
like that and now what they do is you

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.480 
like that and now what they do is you
know<00:04:54.150> I<00:04:54.270> I'm<00:04:54.690> justified<00:04:55.470> and<00:04:55.830> bringing<00:04:56.310> this

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
know I I'm justified and bringing this

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.270 
know I I'm justified and bringing this
card<00:04:56.759> back<00:04:57.000> to<00:04:57.060> the<00:04:57.330> deck<00:04:57.650> because<00:04:58.650> now<00:04:58.830> I<00:04:58.860> need

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
card back to the deck because now I need

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.670 
card back to the deck because now I need
this<00:04:59.490> hand<00:04:59.789> in<00:04:59.970> order<00:05:00.210> to<00:05:00.419> rearrange<00:05:01.199> these

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
this hand in order to rearrange these

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.700 
this hand in order to rearrange these
cards<00:05:02.039> into<00:05:02.250> a<00:05:02.400> neat<00:05:02.699> row<00:05:03.380> so<00:05:04.380> that's<00:05:04.530> how<00:05:04.680> I

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
cards into a neat row so that's how I

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.600 
cards into a neat row so that's how I
make<00:05:04.979> sense<00:05:05.280> of<00:05:05.520> it<00:05:05.610> all<00:05:06.770> all<00:05:07.770> right<00:05:07.949> and<00:05:08.190> then

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
make sense of it all all right and then

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.120 
make sense of it all all right and then
from<00:05:08.759> there<00:05:09.030> I<00:05:09.270> can<00:05:09.710> separate<00:05:10.710> this<00:05:10.860> card

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
from there I can separate this card

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.610 
from there I can separate this card
again<00:05:11.280> so<00:05:11.880> that<00:05:12.509> it's<00:05:12.870> a<00:05:12.930> much<00:05:13.080> cleaner<00:05:13.349> much

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
again so that it's a much cleaner much

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.430 
again so that it's a much cleaner much
more<00:05:13.800> natural<00:05:14.250> and<00:05:14.630> way<00:05:15.630> of<00:05:15.780> doing<00:05:16.050> it<00:05:16.169> just

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
more natural and way of doing it just

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.710 
more natural and way of doing it just
makes<00:05:16.650> makes<00:05:17.130> more<00:05:17.280> sense<00:05:17.520> so<00:05:18.300> let<00:05:18.509> me<00:05:18.599> just

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 
makes makes more sense so let me just

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.270 
makes makes more sense so let me just
backtrack<00:05:21.720> for<00:05:21.930> a<00:05:22.020> second<00:05:22.319> and<00:05:22.889> pinch<00:05:23.159> the

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
backtrack for a second and pinch the

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.159 
backtrack for a second and pinch the
card<00:05:23.520> deal<00:05:23.970> three<00:05:24.210> cards<00:05:24.270> down<00:05:24.630> and<00:05:24.930> sloppy

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:25.169 
card deal three cards down and sloppy

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:27.649 
card deal three cards down and sloppy
way<00:05:25.440> and<00:05:25.770> then<00:05:26.669> we're<00:05:26.849> going<00:05:26.970> to<00:05:27.030> do<00:05:27.180> is<00:05:27.300> you're

00:05:27.649 --> 00:05:27.659 
way and then we're going to do is you're

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:28.999 
way and then we're going to do is you're
going<00:05:27.750> to<00:05:27.840> push<00:05:28.050> over<00:05:28.199> the<00:05:28.289> top<00:05:28.530> card<00:05:28.740> just<00:05:28.889> a

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:29.009

I pull this card flush with with the
rest<00:05:42.630> of<00:05:42.719> the<00:05:42.900> deck<00:05:43.370> okay<00:05:44.370> so<00:05:44.759> I<00:05:44.789> have<00:05:45.030> a<00:05:45.060> neat

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
rest of the deck okay so I have a neat

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.149 
rest of the deck okay so I have a neat
row<00:05:45.509> and<00:05:45.750> they<00:05:45.840> say<00:05:46.050> okay<00:05:46.320> watch<00:05:46.530> this<00:05:46.770> and

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:49.289

and you know I say something don't blink
whatever<00:06:02.389> and<00:06:03.389> here's<00:06:04.110> what's<00:06:04.289> happening

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:05.330 
whatever and here's what's happening

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.820 
whatever and here's what's happening
under<00:06:06.330> the<00:06:06.360> guise<00:06:06.630> of<00:06:06.840> these<00:06:07.259> three<00:06:07.590> cards

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830 
under the guise of these three cards

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.200 
under the guise of these three cards
here's<00:06:08.370> where<00:06:08.639> you're<00:06:08.759> doing<00:06:08.969> with<00:06:09.090> your

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:09.210 
here's where you're doing with your

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:11.559 
here's where you're doing with your
right<00:06:09.360> hand

00:06:11.559 --> 00:06:11.569 

00:06:11.569 --> 00:06:14.360 

alright<00:06:12.569> so<00:06:12.900> without<00:06:13.050> any<00:06:13.319> cover<00:06:13.560> that's<00:06:14.219> a

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:14.370 
alright so without any cover that's a

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:17.540 
alright so without any cover that's a
pretty<00:06:14.580> bad<00:06:14.909> color<00:06:15.389> change<00:06:15.830> but<00:06:16.830> when<00:06:17.430> you're

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:17.550 
pretty bad color change but when you're

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.249 
pretty bad color change but when you're
doing<00:06:17.819> it<00:06:17.909> underneath<00:06:18.150> these<00:06:18.810> three<00:06:19.020> cards

00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:19.259 
doing it underneath these three cards

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:21.980 
doing it underneath these three cards
actually<00:06:19.530> it<00:06:19.770> looks<00:06:19.919> very<00:06:20.159> good<00:06:20.340> so<00:06:20.780> I'm<00:06:21.780> kind

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:21.990 
actually it looks very good so I'm kind

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.080 
actually it looks very good so I'm kind
of<00:06:22.050> tilting<00:06:22.979> my<00:06:23.069> wrist<00:06:23.340> to<00:06:23.490> the<00:06:23.520> right<00:06:23.849> and

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:24.090 
of tilting my wrist to the right and

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:27.050 
of tilting my wrist to the right and
then<00:06:24.719> I'm<00:06:24.840> doing<00:06:24.990> this<00:06:25.259> so<00:06:25.620> the<00:06:26.190> idea<00:06:26.729> is<00:06:26.849> these

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:27.060 
then I'm doing this so the idea is these

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:28.909 
then I'm doing this so the idea is these
cards<00:06:27.419> all<00:06:27.599> three<00:06:28.080> of<00:06:28.259> these<00:06:28.319> cards<00:06:28.620> will<00:06:28.710> flip

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:28.919 
cards all three of these cards will flip

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:31.370 
cards all three of these cards will flip
over<00:06:29.069> hand<00:06:29.849> over<00:06:29.969> here<00:06:30.300> you<00:06:30.630> will<00:06:30.810> also<00:06:30.960> see<00:06:31.259> an

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:31.380 
over hand over here you will also see an

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:33.980 
over hand over here you will also see an
ace<00:06:31.699> so<00:06:32.699> it<00:06:33.030> will<00:06:33.150> take<00:06:33.330> just<00:06:33.449> a<00:06:33.569> little<00:06:33.690> bit<00:06:33.900> of

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:33.990 
ace so it will take just a little bit of

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:37.519 
ace so it will take just a little bit of
practice<00:06:34.319> there<00:06:34.530> to<00:06:34.740> to<00:06:35.400> get<00:06:35.960> the<00:06:36.960> kind<00:06:37.440> of

00:06:37.519 --> 00:06:37.529 
practice there to to get the kind of

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:38.620 
practice there to to get the kind of
flip<00:06:37.800> that<00:06:38.010> you

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:38.630 
flip that you

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:42.140 
flip that you
with<00:06:39.630> something<00:06:39.840> like<00:06:40.110> that<00:06:40.139> and<00:06:41.130> you<00:06:42.030> know

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:42.150 
with something like that and you know

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:43.700 
with something like that and you know
sometimes<00:06:42.509> you<00:06:42.690> may<00:06:42.840> have<00:06:43.050> one<00:06:43.319> card<00:06:43.560> that

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:43.710 
sometimes you may have one card that

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:45.529 
sometimes you may have one card that
remains<00:06:43.979> facedown<00:06:44.370> just<00:06:44.610> go<00:06:44.819> ahead<00:06:44.910> and<00:06:45.180> turn

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:45.539 
remains facedown just go ahead and turn

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:48.140 
remains facedown just go ahead and turn
it<00:06:45.660> over<00:06:46.940> all<00:06:47.940> right

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:48.150 
it over all right

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:50.150 
it over all right
so<00:06:48.599> there's<00:06:49.080> one<00:06:49.259> last<00:06:49.440> thing<00:06:49.590> that<00:06:49.650> I<00:06:49.830> need<00:06:49.860> to

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:50.160 
so there's one last thing that I need to

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.550 
so there's one last thing that I need to
talk<00:06:50.340> about<00:06:50.520> right<00:06:50.819> there<00:06:51.060> is<00:06:51.240> that<00:06:52.080> what<00:06:52.410> you

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:52.560 
talk about right there is that what you

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:53.930 
talk about right there is that what you
do<00:06:52.710> with<00:06:52.919> those<00:06:53.099> right-hand<00:06:53.520> cards<00:06:53.819> right

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:53.940 
do with those right-hand cards right

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:56.570 
do with those right-hand cards right
after<00:06:54.270> you<00:06:54.360> do<00:06:54.479> the<00:06:54.569> switch<00:06:55.340> so<00:06:56.340> you're<00:06:56.460> going

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:56.580 
after you do the switch so you're going

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:58.430 
after you do the switch so you're going
to<00:06:56.639> have<00:06:56.789> your<00:06:57.060> little<00:06:57.210> row<00:06:57.479> you're<00:06:58.259> going<00:06:58.289> to

00:06:58.430 --> 00:06:58.440 
to have your little row you're going to

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.909 
to have your little row you're going to
do<00:06:58.590> your<00:06:58.740> flip<00:07:00.410> like<00:07:01.410> this<00:07:01.620> you're<00:07:01.770> going<00:07:01.860> to

00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:01.919 
do your flip like this you're going to

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:03.469 
do your flip like this you're going to
do<00:07:02.039> your<00:07:02.160> flip<00:07:02.430> and<00:07:02.729> immediately<00:07:03.330> you're

00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:03.479 
do your flip and immediately you're

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:04.730 
do your flip and immediately you're
going<00:07:03.599> to<00:07:03.660> take<00:07:03.840> these<00:07:03.960> cards<00:07:04.229> bring<00:07:04.590> them

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:04.740 
going to take these cards bring them

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:07.520 
going to take these cards bring them
back<00:07:04.979> to<00:07:05.220> the<00:07:05.340> deck<00:07:05.550> and<00:07:06.319> then<00:07:07.319> you're<00:07:07.440> going

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:07.530 
back to the deck and then you're going

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:10.460 
back to the deck and then you're going
to<00:07:07.590> thumb<00:07:07.919> off<00:07:08.130> the<00:07:08.340> single<00:07:08.639> ace<00:07:09.259> just<00:07:10.259> like

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:10.470 
to thumb off the single ace just like

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:14.089 
to thumb off the single ace just like
that<00:07:10.680> you<00:07:10.860> have<00:07:11.159> your<00:07:11.190> 4-h<00:07:12.030> production<00:07:13.099> so

00:07:14.089 --> 00:07:14.099 
that you have your 4-h production so

00:07:14.099 --> 00:07:16.010 
that you have your 4-h production so
that<00:07:14.130> whole<00:07:14.400> sequence<00:07:14.699> happens<00:07:14.940> in<00:07:15.419> less<00:07:15.870> than

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:16.020 
that whole sequence happens in less than

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:18.950 
that whole sequence happens in less than
a<00:07:16.139> second<00:07:16.460> just<00:07:17.460> like<00:07:17.520> that<00:07:17.759> so<00:07:18.539> check<00:07:18.720> out<00:07:18.870> the
