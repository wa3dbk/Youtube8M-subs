putting the dirt to the outside right so

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.850 
putting the dirt to the outside right so
that<00:00:34.970> we<00:00:35.059> could<00:00:35.239> cover<00:00:35.420> our<00:00:35.660> plastic<00:00:36.440> up<00:00:36.589> again

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860

we just you go ahead and start Church
down<00:01:23.540> okay<00:01:24.140> okay<00:01:24.560> and<00:01:24.770> then<00:01:24.830> all<00:01:25.040> right<00:01:25.460> one

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
down okay okay and then all right one

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.080 
down okay okay and then all right one
down<00:01:26.540> and<00:01:26.900> how<00:01:27.620> far<00:01:27.890> do<00:01:28.010> we<00:01:28.070> want<00:01:28.280> them<00:01:28.490> in<00:01:28.520> Oh

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
down and how far do we want them in Oh

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.180 
down and how far do we want them in Oh
however<00:01:29.870> high<00:01:30.320> you<00:01:30.350> want<00:01:30.590> your<00:01:30.800> tunnel<00:01:30.920> but<00:01:31.160> I

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
however high you want your tunnel but I

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.880 
however high you want your tunnel but I
think<00:01:31.490> that<00:01:31.640> looks<00:01:31.820> about<00:01:32.180> where<00:01:33.020> we<00:01:33.200> were<00:01:33.380> and

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
think that looks about where we were and

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.340 
think that looks about where we were and
you<00:01:34.070> want<00:01:34.220> it<00:01:34.340> deep<00:01:34.550> enough<00:01:34.850> to<00:01:35.180> be<00:01:35.690> stable<00:01:36.200> of

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
you want it deep enough to be stable of

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.530 
you want it deep enough to be stable of
course<00:01:36.680> yeah<00:01:37.130> this<00:01:37.340> is<00:01:37.520> Oklahoma<00:01:37.730> the<00:01:38.330> wind

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
blows a lot and we're just trying to

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.960 
blows a lot and we're just trying to
evenly<00:01:41.870> space<00:01:42.260> these<00:01:42.620> the<00:01:42.950> length<00:01:43.160> of<00:01:43.370> our<00:01:43.490> bed

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:52.380 

okay<00:01:48.550> there<00:01:49.550> we<00:01:49.670> go

to<00:02:36.050> close<00:02:36.320> up<00:02:36.560> the<00:02:36.709> end<00:02:36.890> of<00:02:37.100> the<00:02:37.160> tunnel<00:02:44.290> okay

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
to close up the end of the tunnel okay

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.140 
to close up the end of the tunnel okay
now<00:02:45.739> that<00:02:45.890> we<00:02:45.950> have<00:02:46.100> it<00:02:46.250> cut<00:02:46.519> you<00:02:46.760> want<00:02:46.910> to<00:02:47.000> open

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
now that we have it cut you want to open

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.030 
now that we have it cut you want to open
it<00:02:47.390> and<00:02:47.600> this<00:02:47.750> is<00:02:47.930> folded<00:02:48.380> in<00:02:48.500> half<00:02:48.709> so<00:02:48.980> I'm

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
it and this is folded in half so I'm

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.580 
it and this is folded in half so I'm
just<00:02:49.220> holding<00:02:49.430> the<00:02:49.730> middle<00:02:50.000> point

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
just holding the middle point

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.190 
just holding the middle point
so<00:02:52.590> that<00:02:52.739> it's<00:02:53.730> a<00:02:53.849> proud<00:02:54.090> even<00:02:54.360> on<00:02:54.689> each<00:02:54.840> side

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
so that it's a proud even on each side

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.729 
so that it's a proud even on each side
and<00:02:55.590> you<00:02:55.650> made<00:02:56.400> some<00:02:56.430> nice<00:02:56.849> little<00:02:57.030> clips<00:02:57.739> PVC

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
and you made some nice little clips PVC

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.720 
and you made some nice little clips PVC
cut<00:02:59.700> up<00:03:00.049> and<00:03:01.049> we'll<00:03:01.860> just<00:03:02.010> do<00:03:02.189> that<00:03:02.220> to<00:03:02.579> the

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
cut up and we'll just do that to the

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.819 
cut up and we'll just do that to the
length<00:03:02.909> of<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.150> bed<00:03:03.329> and<00:03:03.540> open<00:03:03.810> it<00:03:03.930> up<00:03:04.049> how

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:04.829 
length of the bed and open it up how

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:06.830 
length of the bed and open it up how
tight<00:03:05.129> do<00:03:05.280> we<00:03:05.370> want<00:03:05.549> to<00:03:05.640> pull<00:03:05.819> the<00:03:05.939> plastic<00:03:06.120> oh

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
tight do we want to pull the plastic oh

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.679 
tight do we want to pull the plastic oh
you<00:03:07.230> get<00:03:07.680> as<00:03:07.829> tight<00:03:08.099> as<00:03:08.280> you<00:03:08.400> can<00:03:08.430> not<00:03:09.420> it

00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:09.689 
you get as tight as you can not it

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:12.319 
you get as tight as you can not it
doesn't<00:03:10.019> have<00:03:10.170> to<00:03:10.319> be<00:03:10.640> super<00:03:11.640> tight<00:03:11.939> I<00:03:12.090> think

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
doesn't have to be super tight I think

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:27.110 
doesn't have to be super tight I think
you've<00:03:12.450> got<00:03:12.629> the<00:03:12.780> right<00:03:12.930> in<00:03:13.140> there

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.100 

Oh<00:03:28.580> Kim<00:03:29.580> the<00:03:29.790> next<00:03:30.060> step<00:03:30.239> really<00:03:30.540> is<00:03:30.569> to<00:03:30.720> push

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
Oh Kim the next step really is to push

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.619 
Oh Kim the next step really is to push
this<00:03:31.349> pocket<00:03:31.920> down<00:03:32.099> into<00:03:32.849> the<00:03:32.970> trench<00:03:33.209> that<00:03:33.510> we

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:33.629 
this pocket down into the trench that we

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:36.289 
this pocket down into the trench that we
dug<00:03:33.870> already<00:03:34.440> and<00:03:35.190> so<00:03:35.370> we<00:03:35.519> can<00:03:35.670> either<00:03:35.849> push

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
dug already and so we can either push

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.449 
dug already and so we can either push
that<00:03:36.450> down<00:03:36.629> with<00:03:36.810> our<00:03:36.930> feet<00:03:37.280> that's<00:03:38.280> just

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
that down with our feet that's just

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.250 
that down with our feet that's just
pretty<00:03:38.640> tough<00:03:38.970> plastic<00:03:39.330> so<00:03:39.780> we<00:03:39.870> don't<00:03:40.019> have<00:03:40.140> to

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
pretty tough plastic so we don't have to

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.800 
pretty tough plastic so we don't have to
worry<00:03:40.440> about<00:03:40.560> it<00:03:40.769> too<00:03:40.950> much<00:03:41.030> and<00:03:42.030> then<00:03:42.360> we<00:03:42.599> just

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
worry about it too much and then we just

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:53.660 
worry about it too much and then we just
start<00:03:43.140> filling<00:03:43.680> that<00:03:43.860> trench<00:03:47.480> soil<00:03:52.670> ideally

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
start filling that trench soil ideally

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.770 
start filling that trench soil ideally
you<00:03:53.970> want<00:03:54.150> to<00:03:55.069> get<00:03:56.069> your<00:03:56.280> crop<00:03:56.489> in<00:03:56.760> right<00:03:57.480> and

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
you want to get your crop in right and

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.440 
you want to get your crop in right and
then<00:03:58.019> put<00:03:58.290> the<00:03:58.379> plastic<00:03:58.950> over<00:03:59.129> the<00:03:59.459> top<00:04:02.450> the

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
then put the plastic over the top the

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.449 
then put the plastic over the top the
great<00:04:03.690> thing<00:04:03.930> about<00:04:03.959> putting<00:04:04.500> this<00:04:04.590> sub<00:04:04.890> soil

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
great thing about putting this sub soil

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.300 
great thing about putting this sub soil
down<00:04:05.790> in<00:04:06.329> here<00:04:06.720> is<00:04:06.989> that<00:04:07.019> even<00:04:07.799> if<00:04:08.010> you<00:04:08.129> get<00:04:08.220> a

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
down in here is that even if you get a

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.839 
down in here is that even if you get a
big<00:04:08.549> wind<00:04:08.910> the<00:04:09.629> plastic<00:04:10.140> that<00:04:10.290> they<00:04:10.500> put<00:04:10.799> so<00:04:11.790> if

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 
big wind the plastic that they put so if

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:14.210 
big wind the plastic that they put so if
you<00:04:11.970> were<00:04:12.090> just<00:04:12.120> using<00:04:12.390> Clips<00:04:12.890> it<00:04:13.890> wouldn't

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
you were just using Clips it wouldn't

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.060 
you were just using Clips it wouldn't
hold<00:04:14.310> that<00:04:14.519> plastic<00:04:15.120> down<00:04:15.350> by<00:04:16.350> the<00:04:16.410> soil<00:04:16.769> in

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
hold that plastic down by the soil in

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.849 
hold that plastic down by the soil in
the<00:04:17.100> trench<00:04:17.820> will<00:04:18.090> so<00:04:18.419> the<00:04:18.930> plaster<00:04:19.470> the<00:04:19.620> clips

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
the trench will so the plaster the clips

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.500 
the trench will so the plaster the clips
are<00:04:20.100> nice<00:04:20.250> while<00:04:20.549> you're<00:04:20.729> working<00:04:20.880> just<00:04:21.329> to

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:36.440 
hold it in place especially if you're
working<00:04:24.449> alone<00:04:34.160> all<00:04:35.160> right<00:04:35.220> now<00:04:35.849> that<00:04:36.060> we<00:04:36.180> have

the edges all buried in plastic the crop

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.469 
the edges all buried in plastic the crop
is<00:04:40.680> planted<00:04:40.889> inside<00:04:41.580> we<00:04:41.760> just<00:04:41.789> wait<00:04:42.120> and<00:04:42.300> let

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 
is planted inside we just wait and let

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:43.570 
is planted inside we just wait and let
it<00:04:42.599> grow<00:04:42.720> right

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
it grow right

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.339

00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:46.349 
make sure to water we have drip inside

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:50.089 
make sure to water we have drip inside
so<00:04:47.160> it's<00:04:47.820> easy<00:04:48.060> to<00:04:48.210> water<00:04:48.800> later<00:04:49.800> in<00:04:49.979> the

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:50.099 
so it's easy to water later in the

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:51.890 
so it's easy to water later in the
season<00:04:50.310> we<00:04:50.580> might<00:04:50.760> want<00:04:50.940> to<00:04:51.000> get<00:04:51.150> in<00:04:51.270> here<00:04:51.750> to

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
season we might want to get in here to

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.469 
season we might want to get in here to
start<00:04:52.710> working<00:04:53.190> as<00:04:53.340> the<00:04:53.520> crop<00:04:53.760> grows<00:04:54.120> and<00:04:54.389> we

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 
start working as the crop grows and we

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:57.740 
start working as the crop grows and we
could<00:04:54.690> dig<00:04:55.110> out<00:04:55.229> one<00:04:55.500> side<00:04:56.449> we<00:04:57.449> could<00:04:57.599> weigh

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
could dig out one side we could weigh

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.540 
could dig out one side we could weigh
that<00:04:57.900> down<00:04:58.110> with<00:04:58.289> other<00:04:58.410> materials<00:04:58.979> yeah<00:04:59.490> you

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
that down with other materials yeah you

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.510 
that down with other materials yeah you
could<00:04:59.910> use<00:04:59.940> boards<00:05:00.770> you<00:05:01.770> know<00:05:01.800> you<00:05:02.220> can<00:05:02.370> use

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
could use boards you know you can use

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.860 
could use boards you know you can use
sandbags<00:05:03.110> somebody<00:05:04.110> suggested<00:05:04.620> that<00:05:05.300> so<00:05:06.300> that

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
sandbags somebody suggested that so that

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.020 
sandbags somebody suggested that so that
would<00:05:07.050> work<00:05:07.289> or<00:05:07.620> the<00:05:07.979> other<00:05:08.130> option<00:05:08.400> if<00:05:08.849> you're

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
would work or the other option if you're

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.240 
would work or the other option if you're
if<00:05:09.360> you're<00:05:09.599> really<00:05:09.750> nimble<00:05:10.530> and<00:05:10.919> you<00:05:11.039> don't

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
if you're really nimble and you don't
