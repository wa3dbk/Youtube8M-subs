00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:30.210 
in like more guns I think but then they
never<00:01:29.320> did<00:01:29.530> I<00:01:29.619> guess<00:01:29.770> there<00:01:29.890> must've<00:01:30.040> been<00:01:30.100> a

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
never did I guess there must've been a

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.350 
never did I guess there must've been a
lot<00:01:30.340> of<00:01:30.369> problems<00:01:30.729> with<00:01:30.790> the<00:01:30.909> Peacekeeper

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
lot of problems with the Peacekeeper

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.730 
lot of problems with the Peacekeeper
that's<00:01:31.540> why<00:01:31.659> they<00:01:31.810> didn't<00:01:32.079> make<00:01:32.229> more<00:01:32.500> weapons

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
that's why they didn't make more weapons

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.050 
that's why they didn't make more weapons
but<00:01:33.070> just<00:01:33.220> imagine<00:01:33.549> if<00:01:33.640> they<00:01:33.729> put<00:01:33.939> like

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
but just imagine if they put like

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.999 
but just imagine if they put like
another<00:01:34.450> sniper<00:01:34.930> into<00:01:35.439> the<00:01:35.560> game<00:01:35.710> that<00:01:35.920> would

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
another sniper into the game that would

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:38.219 
another sniper into the game that would
be<00:01:36.130> Sosa<00:01:36.520> anything<00:01:37.090> new<00:01:37.390> in<00:01:37.570> this<00:01:37.689> game<00:01:37.930> like

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
be Sosa anything new in this game like

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:40.649 
be Sosa anything new in this game like
new<00:01:38.500> camos<00:01:39.009> or<00:01:39.220> new<00:01:39.460> snipers<00:01:40.000> or<00:01:40.210> new<00:01:40.420> maps

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
new camos or new snipers or new maps

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:42.359 
new camos or new snipers or new maps
would<00:01:40.869> make<00:01:41.020> this<00:01:41.170> game<00:01:41.380> easily<00:01:41.710> playable<00:01:42.189> for

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369

would make this game easily playable for
another<00:01:42.549> like<00:01:42.759> two<00:01:43.000> or<00:01:43.149> three<00:01:43.180> months<00:01:43.450> I<00:01:43.720> may

first<00:02:42.670> of<00:02:42.790> all<00:02:42.819> I'm<00:02:42.940> doing<00:02:43.120> phase<00:02:43.269> apex<00:02:43.720> is<00:02:43.870> 1

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079 
first of all I'm doing phase apex is 1

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:46.050 
first of all I'm doing phase apex is 1
million<00:02:44.409> subscriber<00:02:44.920> montage<00:02:45.459> challenge<00:02:45.940> and

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
million subscriber montage challenge and

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.190 
million subscriber montage challenge and
actually<00:02:46.359> think<00:02:46.510> that's<00:02:46.659> pretty<00:02:46.840> cool<00:02:46.989> that's

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
actually think that's pretty cool that's

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.080 
actually think that's pretty cool that's
why<00:02:47.319> of<00:02:47.409> the<00:02:47.530> clan<00:02:47.739> tag<00:02:47.950> a<00:02:48.189> be<00:02:48.400> one<00:02:48.670> in<00:02:48.879> right

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
why of the clan tag a be one in right

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.099 
why of the clan tag a be one in right
now<00:02:49.209> that's<00:02:49.420> the<00:02:49.480> client<00:02:49.720> that<00:02:49.810> you<00:02:49.870> need<00:02:50.019> to

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:50.109 
now that's the client that you need to

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:51.599 
now that's the client that you need to
use<00:02:50.230> a<00:02:50.260> clip<00:02:50.650> so<00:02:50.739> you<00:02:50.799> pretty<00:02:50.980> much<00:02:51.159> have<00:02:51.340> one

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:51.609 
use a clip so you pretty much have one

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:53.399 
use a clip so you pretty much have one
week<00:02:51.790> to<00:02:51.940> put<00:02:52.090> out<00:02:52.209> a<00:02:52.239> little<00:02:52.420> montage<00:02:52.870> and<00:02:53.140> I'm

00:05:24.179 --> 00:05:24.189 
solution to that Netflix addiction I

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:26.670 
solution to that Netflix addiction I
only<00:05:24.460> watched<00:05:24.879> 10<00:05:25.360> minute<00:05:25.810> long<00:05:25.960> shows<00:05:26.349> and

only watched 10 minute long shows and

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.019 
only watched 10 minute long shows and
what<00:05:26.800> I<00:05:26.830> mean<00:05:26.979> by<00:05:27.039> that<00:05:27.159> is<00:05:27.339> I<00:05:27.370> only<00:05:27.550> watch<00:05:27.789> like

00:05:28.019 --> 00:05:28.029 
what I mean by that is I only watch like

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:29.399 
what I mean by that is I only watch like
those<00:05:28.300> Cartoon<00:05:28.749> Network<00:05:29.050> shows<00:05:29.229> like

show<00:05:32.889> and<00:05:33.159> obviously<00:05:33.219> the<00:05:33.639> solution<00:05:34.120> doesn't

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300 
show and obviously the solution doesn't

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.879 
show and obviously the solution doesn't
work<00:05:34.539> for<00:05:34.779> everybody<00:05:35.050> because<00:05:35.560> I<00:05:35.680> actually

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:35.889 
work for everybody because I actually

really enjoy watching those shows like

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:38.610 
really enjoy watching those shows like
call<00:05:37.659> me<00:05:37.779> a<00:05:37.839> kid<00:05:38.020> but<00:05:38.169> they're<00:05:38.349> actually

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:38.620 
call me a kid but they're actually

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:39.809 
call me a kid but they're actually
pretty<00:05:38.800> entertaining<00:05:39.099> and<00:05:39.460> the<00:05:39.520> reason<00:05:39.759> that

00:05:39.809 --> 00:05:39.819 
pretty entertaining and the reason that

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:41.219 
pretty entertaining and the reason that
solution<00:05:40.240> works<00:05:40.419> for<00:05:40.629> me<00:05:40.719> is<00:05:40.779> because<00:05:40.960> those

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:41.229 
solution works for me is because those

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:42.809 
solution works for me is because those
episodes<00:05:41.500> are<00:05:41.740> only<00:05:41.889> ten<00:05:42.219> minutes<00:05:42.520> long<00:05:42.610> and<00:05:42.669> I

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:42.819 
episodes are only ten minutes long and I

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:44.610 
episodes are only ten minutes long and I
really<00:05:43.089> only<00:05:43.240> start<00:05:43.599> watching<00:05:43.870> Netflix<00:05:44.409> where

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:51.740 
video an intro and an outro I think it's

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.200 
video an intro and an outro I think it's
really<00:06:51.830> important<00:06:52.310> and<00:06:52.430> I<00:06:52.670> also<00:06:52.850> like<00:06:53.090> to

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:53.210 
really important and I also like to

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:54.730 
really important and I also like to
announce<00:06:53.510> stuff<00:06:53.900> at<00:06:54.020> the<00:06:54.110> end<00:06:54.260> like<00:06:54.440> in<00:06:54.620> the

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:54.740

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:55.930 
announce stuff at the end like in the
outros<00:06:55.100> and<00:06:55.250> I<00:06:55.280> think<00:06:55.430> this<00:06:55.550> is<00:06:55.640> a<00:06:55.670> lot<00:06:55.910> nicer

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:55.940 
outros and I think this is a lot nicer

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.540 
outros and I think this is a lot nicer
it's<00:06:56.690> better<00:06:56.930> than<00:06:57.080> just<00:06:57.290> random<00:06:57.620> black<00:06:58.070> ops<00:06:58.280> 2

00:06:58.540 --> 00:06:58.550 
it's better than just random black ops 2

00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:59.830 
it's better than just random black ops 2
gameplay<00:06:58.820> in<00:06:59.060> the<00:06:59.120> background<00:06:59.480> and<00:06:59.600> just<00:06:59.630> my

00:06:59.830 --> 00:06:59.840 
gameplay in the background and just my

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.570 
gameplay in the background and just my
little<00:06:59.990> tiny<00:07:00.380> face<00:07:00.590> game<00:07:00.860> screen<00:07:01.190> in<00:07:01.280> the<00:07:01.400> side

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:01.580
