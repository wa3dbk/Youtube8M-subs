to be doing any kind of work on an
electrical<00:00:05.279> system<00:00:05.460> you're<00:00:05.730> going<00:00:05.910> to<00:00:06.029> need<00:00:06.150> a

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
electrical system you're going to need a

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.540 
electrical system you're going to need a
multimeter<00:00:06.750> like<00:00:07.020> this<00:00:07.259> this<00:00:08.069> is<00:00:08.280> a<00:00:08.309> very

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
multimeter like this this is a very

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.030 
multimeter like this this is a very
cheap<00:00:08.790> one<00:00:09.000> I<00:00:09.030> think<00:00:09.179> I<00:00:09.420> spent<00:00:09.690> about<00:00:09.830> ten<00:00:10.830> US

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
cheap one I think I spent about ten US

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.310 
cheap one I think I spent about ten US
dollars<00:00:11.460> on<00:00:11.610> it<00:00:11.730> something<00:00:12.000> around<00:00:12.480> there<00:00:12.990> was

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
dollars on it something around there was

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.980 
dollars on it something around there was
about<00:00:13.559> eighty<00:00:13.830> women<00:00:14.250> be<00:00:14.370> anyway<00:00:15.150> what<00:00:15.870> I've

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
about eighty women be anyway what I've

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.599 
about eighty women be anyway what I've
got<00:00:16.170> it<00:00:16.289> set<00:00:16.529> to<00:00:16.560> is<00:00:16.800> I've<00:00:16.920> got<00:00:17.070> it<00:00:17.160> set<00:00:17.430> to<00:00:17.460> the

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
got it set to is I've got it set to the

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.689 
got it set to is I've got it set to the
20<00:00:18.090> DC<00:00:19.020> volt<00:00:19.260> range<00:00:19.590> which<00:00:20.160> is<00:00:20.310> what<00:00:20.520> we're

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
20 DC volt range which is what we're

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.200 
20 DC volt range which is what we're
working<00:00:20.850> in<00:00:21.180> here<00:00:21.420> now<00:00:22.109> I've<00:00:22.560> connected<00:00:22.830> the

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
working in here now I've connected the

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.000 
working in here now I've connected the
black<00:00:24.210> negative<00:00:24.779> up<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.680> negative

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
black negative up to the negative

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.320 
black negative up to the negative
terminal<00:00:26.369> there<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:26.730> I'm<00:00:26.849> just<00:00:27.090> going<00:00:27.269> to

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
terminal there and I'm just going to

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.779 
terminal there and I'm just going to
touch<00:00:27.599> this<00:00:27.810> here<00:00:28.109> and<00:00:28.289> you<00:00:29.070> can<00:00:29.250> see<00:00:29.429> it<00:00:29.550> reads

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
touch this here and you can see it reads

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.520 
touch this here and you can see it reads
a<00:00:29.970> healthy<00:00:30.590> almost<00:00:31.590> 13<00:00:32.040> volts<00:00:32.430> 12.8<00:00:33.210> odd<00:00:34.079> volts

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
a healthy almost 13 volts 12.8 odd volts

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.810 
a healthy almost 13 volts 12.8 odd volts
now<00:00:35.430> what<00:00:36.180> you<00:00:36.300> need<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.540> check<00:00:36.750> is<00:00:37.079> that<00:00:37.820> your

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
now what you need to check is that your

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.010 
now what you need to check is that your
fuse<00:00:39.030> is<00:00:39.210> intact<00:00:39.510> of<00:00:39.719> course<00:00:40.969> now<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.300> funny

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
fuse is intact of course now the funny

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.139 
fuse is intact of course now the funny
thing<00:00:43.110> is<00:00:43.320> my<00:00:43.800> bike<00:00:44.399> didn't<00:00:44.700> actually<00:00:44.820> have<00:00:45.120> a

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
thing is my bike didn't actually have a

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.090 
thing is my bike didn't actually have a
fuse<00:00:45.510> detached<00:00:45.870> it<00:00:46.050> was<00:00:46.170> just<00:00:46.379> wired<00:00:46.800> directly

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
fuse detached it was just wired directly

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.340 
fuse detached it was just wired directly
I<00:00:47.399> actually<00:00:47.610> added<00:00:48.000> this<00:00:48.090> because<00:00:48.809> whoever

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
I actually added this because whoever

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.080 
I actually added this because whoever
put<00:00:49.620> this<00:00:49.739> bike<00:00:49.980> together<00:00:50.219> you<00:00:50.820> know<00:00:50.910> because

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
put this bike together you know because

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.150 
put this bike together you know because
it's<00:00:51.210> put<00:00:51.360> together<00:00:51.530> by<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.559> lot<00:00:52.770> of<00:00:52.860> parts

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
it's put together by a lot of parts

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.979 
it's put together by a lot of parts
different<00:00:53.399> parts<00:00:53.820> they<00:00:54.390> obviously<00:00:54.510> thought

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
different parts they obviously thought

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.600 
different parts they obviously thought
it<00:00:55.140> wasn't<00:00:55.469> necessary<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:55.980> it<00:00:56.280> is<00:00:56.399> necessary

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
it wasn't necessary and it is necessary

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.569 
it wasn't necessary and it is necessary
because<00:00:57.360> if<00:00:57.600> you<00:00:57.719> get<00:00:57.840> over<00:00:58.079> voltage<00:00:58.469> this<00:00:59.309> is

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
because if you get over voltage this is

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.810 
because if you get over voltage this is
what's<00:00:59.820> going<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.120> save<00:01:00.930> your<00:01:01.609> electrics<00:01:02.609> like

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
what's going to save your electrics like

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.369 
what's going to save your electrics like
your<00:01:03.000> light<00:01:03.149> bulbs<00:01:03.539> things<00:01:03.809> like<00:01:04.019> that

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
your light bulbs things like that

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.580 
your light bulbs things like that
so<00:01:05.040> basically<00:01:05.489> it<00:01:06.210> goes<00:01:06.450> from<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.320> fuse

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
so basically it goes from the fuse

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.450 
so basically it goes from the fuse
through<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.760> your<00:01:08.909> regulator<00:01:09.270> etc<00:01:10.010> now<00:01:11.010> over

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
through to your regulator etc now over

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.840 
through to your regulator etc now over
here<00:01:11.850> we<00:01:12.750> have<00:01:12.900> our<00:01:12.930> CDI<00:01:13.520> now<00:01:14.520> we<00:01:14.580> shouldn't

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
here we have our CDI now we shouldn't

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.580 
here we have our CDI now we shouldn't
have<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.119> worry<00:01:15.299> about<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.600> CDI<00:01:15.900> because<00:01:16.320> if

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
have to worry about the CDI because if

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.770 
have to worry about the CDI because if
your<00:01:16.799> bike<00:01:17.100> is<00:01:17.130> starting<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.030> getting<00:01:18.150> spark

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
your bike is starting and getting spark

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.620 
your bike is starting and getting spark
then<00:01:19.590> your<00:01:19.979> CDI<00:01:20.340> is<00:01:20.430> working<00:01:20.880> perfectly<00:01:21.360> fine

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
then your CDI is working perfectly fine

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.240 
then your CDI is working perfectly fine
so<00:01:21.930> now<00:01:22.350> let's<00:01:22.590> do<00:01:22.740> a<00:01:22.770> little<00:01:22.890> bit<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:23.159> an

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
so now let's do a little bit of an

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.710 
so now let's do a little bit of an
experiment<00:01:23.880> I'm<00:01:23.970> going<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.210> start<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.570> bike

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
experiment I'm going to start the bike

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:33.150 
experiment I'm going to start the bike
okay

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.160 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.590 

I<00:01:34.160> need<00:01:34.370> to<00:01:34.490> disposition<00:01:35.030> this<00:01:35.210> so<00:01:35.360> that<00:01:35.480> we

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
I need to disposition this so that we

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:43.859 
I need to disposition this so that we
can<00:01:35.630> see<00:01:36.020> it<00:01:36.110> as<00:01:36.230> I<00:01:36.320> rivet<00:01:37.960> it's<00:01:38.960> jam<00:01:39.290> that

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:48.630 

come<00:01:44.869> on

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.640 

since<00:01:49.420> never<00:01:49.630> work<00:01:49.810> out<00:01:49.960> as<00:01:50.110> late<00:01:50.260> as<00:01:50.320> you

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
since never work out as late as you

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:57.100 
since never work out as late as you
planning

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.660 

okay<00:01:58.110> let<00:01:58.560> me<00:01:58.650> find<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:58.950> way<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.130> position<00:01:59.580> this

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
okay let me find a way to position this

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.160 
okay let me find a way to position this
camera<00:02:00.060> so<00:02:00.210> that<00:02:00.240> you<00:02:00.420> can<00:02:00.570> see<00:02:00.720> what's<00:02:00.900> going

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
camera so that you can see what's going

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:21.130 
camera so that you can see what's going
on

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.920 

okay<00:02:21.590> we<00:02:21.710> can<00:02:21.860> see<00:02:22.040> the<00:02:22.130> multimeter<00:02:22.870> now<00:02:23.870> we

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
okay we can see the multimeter now we

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.450 
okay we can see the multimeter now we
can<00:02:24.200> see<00:02:24.380> that<00:02:24.530> it's<00:02:24.710> reading<00:02:25.040> the<00:02:25.100> voltage

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
can see that it's reading the voltage

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:33.449 
can see that it's reading the voltage
I'm<00:02:25.580> going<00:02:25.820> to<00:02:25.940> rev<00:02:26.210> the<00:02:26.240> bike<00:02:26.770> okay

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.960 

little<00:02:33.849> bit<00:02:33.969> dodgy<00:02:34.599> over<00:02:34.900> here

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
little bit dodgy over here

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.600 
little bit dodgy over here
well<00:02:36.570> look<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.960> fact<00:02:37.200> is<00:02:37.350> when<00:02:38.130> your<00:02:38.250> bike<00:02:38.430> is

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
well look the fact is when your bike is

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.460 
well look the fact is when your bike is
running<00:02:38.790> if<00:02:39.030> it's<00:02:39.210> reading<00:02:39.540> over<00:02:39.660> 12<00:02:40.080> volts

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
running if it's reading over 12 volts

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.560 
running if it's reading over 12 volts
you're<00:02:40.680> okay<00:02:41.070> that's<00:02:41.910> what<00:02:42.150> you're<00:02:42.270> looking

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
you're okay that's what you're looking

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.540 
you're okay that's what you're looking
for<00:02:42.870> that<00:02:43.470> means<00:02:43.680> that<00:02:43.860> your<00:02:43.980> battery<00:02:44.100> will<00:02:44.460> be

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
for that means that your battery will be

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.790 
for that means that your battery will be
charging<00:02:45.030> it's<00:02:45.570> anything<00:02:45.960> under<00:02:46.170> 12<00:02:46.440> volts

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
charging it's anything under 12 volts

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.720 
charging it's anything under 12 volts
you're<00:02:47.520> basically<00:02:48.000> in<00:02:48.090> trouble<00:02:48.570> okay<00:02:49.410> so<00:02:50.160> here

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
you're basically in trouble okay so here

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.180 
you're basically in trouble okay so here
we're<00:02:50.850> reading<00:02:51.000> a<00:02:51.210> healthy<00:02:51.570> 12.8<00:02:52.350> 2008

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
we're reading a healthy 12.8 2008

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.700 
we're reading a healthy 12.8 2008
there<00:02:54.520> we<00:02:54.640> go<00:02:54.790> see<00:02:55.210> as<00:02:55.270> I<00:02:55.480> read<00:02:55.690> it<00:02:55.870> it<00:02:56.350> goes<00:02:56.500> up

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.710 
there we go see as I read it it goes up

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:00.980 
there we go see as I read it it goes up
to<00:02:56.860> 13

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.130 

anyway<00:03:01.980> you<00:03:02.040> get<00:03:02.220> the<00:03:02.280> idea<00:03:03.030> basically<00:03:03.900> it's

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
anyway you get the idea basically it's

anyway you get the idea basically it's
got<00:03:04.350> to<00:03:04.500> be<00:03:04.650> charging<00:03:05.430> the<00:03:05.550> battery<00:03:05.850> not

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
got to be charging the battery not

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.420 
got to be charging the battery not
draining<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.510> battery<00:03:06.870> okay<00:03:07.500> so<00:03:07.950> now<00:03:08.190> I'm

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
draining the battery okay so now I'm

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.600 
draining the battery okay so now I'm
going<00:03:08.610> to<00:03:08.730> turn<00:03:08.880> off<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.180> engine<00:03:10.070> okay<00:03:11.070> great

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
going to turn off the engine okay great

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.640 
going to turn off the engine okay great
now<00:03:12.090> um<00:03:12.830> if<00:03:13.830> I<00:03:14.010> take<00:03:14.220> this<00:03:14.400> fuse<00:03:14.730> out<00:03:15.000> okay<00:03:15.870> this

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
now um if I take this fuse out okay this

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.470 
now um if I take this fuse out okay this
is<00:03:16.770> what<00:03:16.920> should<00:03:17.130> happen<00:03:17.340> if<00:03:17.640> your<00:03:17.850> wiring<00:03:18.240> is

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
is what should happen if your wiring is

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.050 
is what should happen if your wiring is
correct<00:03:18.690> see<00:03:18.990> the<00:03:19.080> fuses<00:03:19.440> out<00:03:19.650> now<00:03:19.890> I<00:03:20.160> turn<00:03:21.030> on

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
correct see the fuses out now I turn on

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.130 
correct see the fuses out now I turn on
the<00:03:21.270> ignition<00:03:21.390> and<00:03:23.540> nothing<00:03:24.540> you<00:03:24.750> should<00:03:24.960> get

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
the ignition and nothing you should get

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.630 
the ignition and nothing you should get
nothing<00:03:25.590> you<00:03:25.620> shouldn't<00:03:25.980> be<00:03:26.070> able<00:03:26.160> to<00:03:26.340> start

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
nothing you shouldn't be able to start

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.790 
nothing you shouldn't be able to start
the<00:03:26.790> bike<00:03:26.940> the<00:03:27.180> bike<00:03:27.330> shouldn't<00:03:27.780> run<00:03:27.990> without

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
the bike the bike shouldn't run without

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.620 
the bike the bike shouldn't run without
this<00:03:29.010> fuse<00:03:29.580> okay

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
this fuse okay

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.270 
this fuse okay
so<00:03:31.080> just<00:03:31.290> make<00:03:31.470> sure<00:03:31.680> if<00:03:31.800> your<00:03:31.950> bike<00:03:32.100> is

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
so just make sure if your bike is

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.030 
so just make sure if your bike is
starting<00:03:32.910> with<00:03:33.270> the<00:03:33.480> fuse<00:03:33.750> out<00:03:33.960> that<00:03:34.800> means

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
starting with the fuse out that means

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.460 
starting with the fuse out that means
there's<00:03:35.310> some<00:03:35.520> serious<00:03:35.910> wiring<00:03:36.390> issues<00:03:36.810> okay

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
there's some serious wiring issues okay

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.170 
there's some serious wiring issues okay
so<00:03:37.740> let's<00:03:38.010> put<00:03:38.160> that<00:03:38.190> fuse<00:03:38.520> back<00:03:38.700> in<00:03:40.730> okay<00:03:41.730> I'm

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
so let's put that fuse back in okay I'm

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.340 
so let's put that fuse back in okay I'm
going<00:03:42.300> to<00:03:42.360> put<00:03:42.480> the<00:03:42.570> fuse<00:03:42.780> back<00:03:42.930> in<00:03:43.140> then<00:03:43.260> I'm

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
going to put the fuse back in then I'm

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:44.900 
going to put the fuse back in then I'm
going<00:03:43.530> to<00:03:43.680> open<00:03:44.010> the<00:03:44.280> front<00:03:44.430> cover<00:03:44.550> we're

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
going to open the front cover we're

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.350 
going to open the front cover we're
going<00:03:45.060> to<00:03:45.180> look<00:03:45.300> at<00:03:45.510> the<00:03:45.780> regulator<00:03:46.440> okay<00:03:47.040> so

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
going to look at the regulator okay so

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.080 
going to look at the regulator okay so
I'll<00:03:48.360> be<00:03:48.420> right<00:03:48.870> back
