00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.910 

now<00:02:17.820> I<00:02:17.850> believe<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.300> original<00:02:18.450> version<00:02:19.020> and<00:02:19.290> a

staircase<00:02:20.459> as<00:02:20.850> a<00:02:20.880> base<00:02:21.120> what<00:02:21.959> I<00:02:21.990> think<00:02:22.230> is<00:02:22.350> much

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
staircase as a base what I think is much

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:23.990 
staircase as a base what I think is much
cooler<00:02:22.709> than<00:02:22.950> this<00:02:23.070> one<00:02:23.250> it<00:02:23.400> was<00:02:23.520> like<00:02:23.550> a<00:02:23.730> place

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
where like some checkered pattern to it

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.580 
where like some checkered pattern to it

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.510 

so<00:02:58.020> first<00:02:58.260> away<00:02:58.440> at<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:58.590> base<00:02:58.709> and<00:02:59.100> since<00:02:59.370> it's

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
so first away at the base and since it's

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.960 
so first away at the base and since it's
a<00:02:59.610> plain<00:03:00.030> wood<00:03:00.300> base<00:03:00.540> or<00:03:01.140> wood<00:03:01.860> pattern<00:03:02.100> which

a plain wood base or wood pattern which
is<00:03:03.000> fine<00:03:03.360> an<00:03:03.480> ovoid<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:04.769> original<00:03:05.130> base<00:03:05.459> was

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
is fine an ovoid the original base was

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:06.460 
is fine an ovoid the original base was
much<00:03:05.820> cooler

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
much cooler

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.850 
much cooler
