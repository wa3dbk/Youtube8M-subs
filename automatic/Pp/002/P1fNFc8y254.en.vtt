00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
kind of long way drawn out look on their

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.280 
kind of long way drawn out look on their
face<00:01:26.189> you<00:01:26.939> you<00:01:27.360> kind<00:01:27.570> of<00:01:27.689> get<00:01:27.810> into<00:01:28.080> this

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
face you you kind of get into this

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.469 
face you you kind of get into this
loosen<00:01:28.770> state<00:01:29.159> of<00:01:29.310> inebriation<00:01:29.520> when<00:01:30.329> you

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
loosen state of inebriation when you

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.300 
loosen state of inebriation when you
drink<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.990> fair<00:01:31.380> amount<00:01:31.470> of<00:01:31.680> absence<00:01:32.130> so<00:01:32.280> I

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
drink a fair amount of absence so I

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.039 
drink a fair amount of absence so I
think<00:01:32.430> there<00:01:32.820> is<00:01:32.909> probably<00:01:33.119> something<00:01:33.720> there

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
think there is probably something there

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.490 
think there is probably something there
but<00:01:34.229> as<00:01:34.320> far<00:01:34.829> as<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.310> hallucinogenics<00:01:36.180> go

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
but as far as the hallucinogenics go

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.530 
but as far as the hallucinogenics go
been<00:01:37.500> proven<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:38.009> thurs<00:01:38.640> own<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:39.030> not<00:01:39.060> a

then you essentially just wait till the
sugar<00:04:27.979> cube<00:04:28.930> dissolves<00:04:29.930> and<00:04:30.169> this<00:04:30.560> is<00:04:30.680> what

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
sugar cube dissolves and this is what
