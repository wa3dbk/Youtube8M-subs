00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
pretty much everything that Disney does

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.409 
pretty much everything that Disney does
not<00:05:30.300> stand<00:05:30.570> for<00:05:30.690> so<00:05:31.500> it's<00:05:31.890> like<00:05:32.190> you<00:05:33.090> know<00:05:33.120> i

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:33.419 
not stand for so it's like you know i

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:36.170 
not stand for so it's like you know i
don't<00:05:33.780> know<00:05:34.230> i'm<00:05:34.380> not<00:05:34.560> saying<00:05:35.490> that<00:05:35.669> is<00:05:35.970> he

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
don't know i'm not saying that is he

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.409 
don't know i'm not saying that is he
definitely<00:05:36.480> did<00:05:36.840> this<00:05:37.050> but<00:05:37.860> to<00:05:38.460> me<00:05:38.700> it<00:05:39.060> feels

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:39.419 
definitely did this but to me it feels

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:44.570 
definitely did this but to me it feels
like<00:05:40.340> Disney<00:05:41.340> had<00:05:41.640> to<00:05:41.970> make<00:05:42.600> iron<00:05:42.870> man<00:05:43.550> into<00:05:44.550> a

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
like Disney had to make iron man into a

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:49.540 
like Disney had to make iron man into a
more<00:05:46.040> Disney<00:05:47.040> acceptable<00:05:47.910> character<00:05:48.630> so

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550 
more Disney acceptable character so

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.390 
more Disney acceptable character so
there<00:05:50.550> really<00:05:50.970> wasn't<00:05:51.330> much<00:05:51.750> if<00:05:52.410> any<00:05:52.770> drinking

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400 
there really wasn't much if any drinking

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.990 
there really wasn't much if any drinking
in<00:05:53.610> the<00:05:53.640> movie<00:05:54.060> uh<00:05:54.870> you<00:05:55.470> know<00:05:55.560> he<00:05:55.830> was<00:05:56.010> you<00:05:56.970> know

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
in the movie uh you know he was you know

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.180 
in the movie uh you know he was you know
right<00:05:57.510> there<00:05:57.720> with<00:05:57.960> pepper<00:05:58.380> potts<00:05:58.740> the<00:05:59.010> whole

00:05:59.180 --> 00:05:59.190 
right there with pepper potts the whole

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:01.520 
right there with pepper potts the whole
time<00:05:59.400> he<00:05:59.760> wasn't<00:06:00.120> he<00:06:00.780> was<00:06:00.870> definitely<00:06:01.350> not<00:06:01.500> a

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.530 
time he wasn't he was definitely not a

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:04.219 
time he wasn't he was definitely not a
womanizer<00:06:02.010> at<00:06:02.460> all<00:06:02.760> in<00:06:03.060> the<00:06:03.180> movie<00:06:03.450> which<00:06:03.930> I'm

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:04.229 
womanizer at all in the movie which I'm

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:06.290 
womanizer at all in the movie which I'm
not<00:06:04.770> saying<00:06:04.979> he<00:06:05.190> should<00:06:05.460> be<00:06:05.669> him<00:06:05.850> I<00:06:05.970> didn't

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.300 
not saying he should be him I didn't

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:10.280 
not saying he should be him I didn't
like<00:06:06.540> that<00:06:06.570> part<00:06:07.169> about<00:06:07.320> him<00:06:07.590> but<00:06:08.870> it<00:06:09.870> did

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:10.290 
like that part about him but it did

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:13.219 
like that part about him but it did
change<00:06:10.740> who<00:06:11.460> I<00:06:11.490> earn<00:06:11.700> man<00:06:12.030> was<00:06:12.360> in<00:06:12.690> my<00:06:12.900> opinion

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:13.229 
change who I earn man was in my opinion

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:17.930 
change who I earn man was in my opinion
but<00:06:13.880> I<00:06:14.880> don't<00:06:15.450> overall<00:06:16.020> I<00:06:16.350> think<00:06:16.979> I<00:06:17.460> have<00:06:17.700> to

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:17.940 
but I don't overall I think I have to

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.450 
but I don't overall I think I have to
still<00:06:18.210> say<00:06:18.450> that<00:06:18.660> I<00:06:18.690> liked<00:06:19.050> the<00:06:19.290> movie<00:06:19.460> because

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:20.460 
still say that I liked the movie because

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:23.120 
still say that I liked the movie because
I<00:06:20.610> like<00:06:20.850> Iron<00:06:21.240> Man<00:06:21.360> and<00:06:21.840> it's<00:06:22.260> hard<00:06:22.560> to<00:06:22.770> make<00:06:22.950> me

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:23.130 
I like Iron Man and it's hard to make me

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:27.260 
I like Iron Man and it's hard to make me
not<00:06:23.490> like<00:06:23.850> Iron<00:06:24.270> Man<00:06:24.950> but<00:06:25.950> i<00:06:26.280> don't<00:06:27.090> i<00:06:27.210> just

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:27.270 
not like Iron Man but i don't i just

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:29.600 
not like Iron Man but i don't i just
think<00:06:28.080> that<00:06:28.169> they<00:06:28.380> could<00:06:28.440> have<00:06:28.710> done<00:06:28.830> so<00:06:29.370> much

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:29.610 
think that they could have done so much

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:33.290 
think that they could have done so much
more<00:06:29.669> with<00:06:30.419> that<00:06:30.660> movie<00:06:31.110> if<00:06:31.320> they<00:06:31.979> go<00:06:32.820> on<00:06:32.970> with

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:33.300 
more with that movie if they go on with

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.170 
more with that movie if they go on with
how<00:06:33.570> the<00:06:34.050> mandarin<00:06:34.620> is<00:06:34.860> really<00:06:35.460> like<00:06:35.729> in<00:06:35.940> the

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:36.180 
how the mandarin is really like in the

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.220 
how the mandarin is really like in the
comics<00:06:36.660> with<00:06:37.320> the<00:06:37.440> ten<00:06:37.740> ring

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:38.230 
comics with the ten ring

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:41.040 
comics with the ten ring
and<00:06:38.590> all<00:06:38.710> I<00:06:39.010> don't<00:06:40.000> know<00:06:40.060> I<00:06:40.330> think<00:06:40.630> it<00:06:40.900> would

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:41.050 
and all I don't know I think it would

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:43.050 
and all I don't know I think it would
have<00:06:41.140> been<00:06:41.230> a<00:06:41.290> far<00:06:41.770> better<00:06:42.010> movie<00:06:42.520> if<00:06:42.790> they'd

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:43.060 
have been a far better movie if they'd

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:47.640 
have been a far better movie if they'd
done<00:06:43.900> it<00:06:43.930> more<00:06:44.230> like<00:06:44.410> that<00:06:44.700> but<00:06:45.700> I<00:06:46.530> don't<00:06:47.530> know

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:47.650 
done it more like that but I don't know

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:49.620 
done it more like that but I don't know
maybe<00:06:48.100> it's<00:06:48.250> because<00:06:48.490> of<00:06:48.640> Disney<00:06:49.090> maybe<00:06:49.360> not

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:49.630 
maybe it's because of Disney maybe not

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:53.220 
maybe it's because of Disney maybe not
