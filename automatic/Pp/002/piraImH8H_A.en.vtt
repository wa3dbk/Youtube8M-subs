00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.580
 from meat 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.040
 in order to make it mince on 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.759
 small pieces and now will 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.759
 twist 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.980
 it turned out your two kilograms 300 grams 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:37.239
 we will divide it into three parts 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:39.970
 way from 500 grams somewhere grub 400 500 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:42.580

 frosts and brother again, burgers 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.470
 the rest is an important rosary just without 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.989
 additives if we want to make of 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.559

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:56.500

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.940
 I dropped the hand rub on the Bernoulli and here 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.640
 since I don't care about the meat grinder 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.320
 I will include both meat and onions through 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:08.350
 meat grinder and here it is with me 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:12.369

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:20.740
 I will do more meat and you 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:24.940
 you will have no meat, let me spread the mince 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:27.670
 a drop to freeze you do , 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:37.030
 only forcemeat for freezing, we will divide into 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:42.100
 two cutlet style pieces naturally 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:45.250
 can that be so but we will now do 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.920
 I have about 450 500 meatballs here 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.530

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:04.720
 meatballs 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:10.750
