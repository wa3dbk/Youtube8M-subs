00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:09.460
 Good morning, Solidworks . 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:11.830
 This time, I'll explain how to use Solid Attack Explorer 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:17.680
 I will explain about 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:19.060
 SolidWorks parts assembly drawing files are organically linked together 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.030
 There is 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:27.550
 Let's check through the following photograph 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:33.280
 When creating a part file for SolidWorks, the unique id or storage location of the part 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:38.890
 8 names, and so on. These basic information are used for assembly 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:43.929
 When you create or create a view, you move it together 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:49.149
 If you modify a nice file, the drawing will also be automatically corrected or the part file 

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:55.149
 This means that the assembly will be modified as well 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:01:01.329
 However, if you rename a part in the Windows Explorer window, 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:01:07.210
 The information such as unique id, storage location and file name is removed. 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:09.820
 The part is used and so the assembly of links are connected in the drawing 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:14.860
 It will be cut off. 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:19.799
 Therefore , depending on the assembly or lookup operation, SolidWorks files 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.799
 I can say that management is very important. 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:32.700
 Let's create an environment where the error occurred through the following example 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:39.530
 I opened the folder where the parts and assembly files are stored as follows 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:39.530
 Let's change the name of the part file here. 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:51.730
 If you rename it like this in the window navigation window 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:58.060
 This error message is displayed when the assembly file is executed 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:59.470
 That is, to find the renamed part or to suppress the missing part 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:06.850
 It's marked. 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:10.969
 If you suppress this marking, you will see that the used parts of the assembly 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:15.469
 I will be there no sound 

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:22.150
 So when you rename the parts part in the Windows Explorer window 

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:22.150
 You can see that the assembly also has a breathtaking effect 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:32.260
 To do so, you need to change the name, move the folder, 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:38.200
 We need to know how to do it. 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:39.430
 You can easily solve these problems with the SolidWorks Explorer tool. 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.980
 can 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:46.510
 The SolidWorks explorer can be started by pressing the Start button, 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:52.239
 Works 2014 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:56.340
 If you run Internet Explorer to the folder where the SolidWorks application, as follows: 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.340
 You can check that it is installed 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:04.090
 There is a SolidWorks Explorer icon appears as follows: expand the area 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:10.359
 I'll try. 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:13.540
 Then I have a folder that is installed on the SolidWorks desktop at once 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:19.590
 You can see what is displayed 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:26.549
 That is when you use SolidWorks Explorer preview of SolidWorks files or 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:26.549
 Or you can check the properties of parts at once 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:41.470
 We will then run the folder with the assembly as shown in 1 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:47.380
 And I would change the name by arbitrarily selecting one of the part puts in the folder. 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:50.980
 To change the name, right-click and rename it. 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:56.880
 You can see that Hutton is marked 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:04:03.490
 Rename Click on the button of the assembly, so this part is also used 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:05.970
 Make sure that the name you want to change is displayed as Bark 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:05.970
 can 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:17.519
 Let's change the name here: 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:24.479
 And if you change your name 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:28.169
 There is also a renamed part and an assembly of parts that have been renamed 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:33.270
 You can confirm that it has been applied 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:36.060
 Let 's see if it runs without errors. 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:39.330
 Press the Refresh button again 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:43.100
 Make sure the name has changed. 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.100
 Let's run the assembly 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:51.900
 The first part has been renamed in Explorer so the link is broken 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:57.590
 But if you change the name in Explorer, 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:57.590
 You can see that it has been applied to the assembly 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:07.950
 If you use Explorer in the same way 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:09.750
 You can also rename, reposition, or switch to another part. 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:15.960
 I will. 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:21.570
 This will also change the name of the assembly to which the part is applied 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:24.560
 You need to change the name to prevent the assembly from breaking or tripping. 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.560
 I can do it. 

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:35.009
 When you change the location with the location, while also applying the so applied to the assembly 

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:35.009
 I can change it. 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:43.550
 About how to use the most basic SolidWorks Explorer 

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:48.710
 I explained. 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:51.620
 More happy to explain one thing to tip the author used here is sleep Explorer 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:56.660
 Once you've verified that it's installed 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:06:03.229
 You can also easily change the name if the Windows navigation pane 

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:08.870
 1 Do not directly click on the name of the part to change it, 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:12.740
 If you click the mouse button Rename to use SolidWorks Explorer 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:16.850
 The options are displayed with options and flower highs 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:22.750
 In this way you do not run the Windows Explorer if you switch your name 

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:22.750
 I can easily change the name in Explorer. 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:29.230
 Thus explain how to file management of SolidWorks 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:34.390
 I gave you 

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:38.080
 Meanwhile, break, changing the name of the SolidWorks assembly files or surface 

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:43.240
 Users who have experienced such inconvenience 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:49.920
 Hasyeoseo using Internet Explorer Tools teuleojim or look in the assembly modeling 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:49.920
 Please use it to prevent work breakage. Thank you.
