Hi my name is Duncan Weekes and today i'm
going to show you how to sideshift an excavator

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:25.160
on a JCB Backhoe loader. The sideshift can
be done it two ways. Either by manually pushing

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:35.550
the excavator across or using a hydraulic
to manouvere it. So let's take a look at the

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:43.239
manual process. First thing we need to do
is release the hydro clamps. Next, an audible

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:48.930
alarm warns the operator that the clamps are
released. Then, by using the excavator we

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:57.949
push the slider across. Once we have reached
the desired position we need to clamp the

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:06.119
excavator back to the main chassis, and this
is simply done by switching off the switch.

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:13.299
For the hydraulic process, known as PowerSlide,
we need to follow the same steps as before.

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:20.030
So first, release the hydroclamps. To move
the excavator across we use the same circuit

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:27.140
as the extending dipper. This is controlled
by either the roller on top of the right hand

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.079
joy stick on a servo machine, or on a manual
machine, via the foot pedal. By using the

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:39.369
roller on top of the right hand joystick this
enables us to move the excavator left or right

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:45.310
to the desired position, without the need
to use the ground to reposition the excavator.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:51.719
Therefore, no damage has to be inflicted.
Once in position, its time to re energise

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.840
and clamp the excavator back to the chassis.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:10.620
And that's how to, from me, finished. And remember, if you are ever unsure, you can
always refer to your operator's manual.
