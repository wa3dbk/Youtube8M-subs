00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.620
 nicest there were remained under the wings 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.329
 from your father 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.270
 where you have been working for five years 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.009
 and actually decide to 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.929
 can go and then you also develop one

 own way of doing business my own 

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:13.410
 genius of leadership might be cool

 how would you manage that way 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:19.140
 listen carefully to yourself 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.810
 that employees when taking 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.470
 decide you are in the position of the person 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.349
 who you talk to 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:30.989
 places on and or comments on the 

00:01:28.349 --> 00:01:33.149
 necessary self-reflection 

00:01:30.989 --> 00:01:34.890
 able to handle and now it goes in one 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:37.020
 company for passion because you also follow your 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.009
 passion as a result of that passion 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.229
 he built a nice company and 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.670
 You earn money playing other motive 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.099
 and maybe a role with you 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.899
 social factors 

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:48.030
 mainly with us in the organization and 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.709
 social social factors a whole 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.789
 play an important role 

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:52.950
 it may sound like a huge one 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:54.509
 clichÃ© but it's a whole one for us 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.819
 big family 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.770
 Finally you have the three children 

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:00.619
 u against him as strict as your father 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.300
 they must also go into business 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.690
 I'm here strictly perhaps 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.190
 stricter 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:09.450
 you can also be a bit strict yes me but 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.090
 they don't have to saw 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.950
 no they want it, I don't know 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.629
 maybe they find the pressure on it 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.650
 being laid on them would be way too big 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.940
 quite possible here 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.750
 lies a bit on your each the light 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.750
