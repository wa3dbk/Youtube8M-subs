across put the handle Reggie on that to

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.730 
across put the handle Reggie on that to
lock<00:01:17.210> and<00:01:17.630> you've<00:01:18.200> got<00:01:18.320> a<00:01:18.380> spreading<00:01:18.860> capacity

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
lock and you've got a spreading capacity

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:26.130 
lock and you've got a spreading capacity
simply<00:01:21.740> again<00:01:22.040> to<00:01:22.700> the<00:01:22.820> unit<00:01:23.619> spread<00:01:24.619> and<00:01:24.979> hold

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
simply again to the unit spread and hold

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.510 
simply again to the unit spread and hold
unique<00:01:27.140> feature<00:01:27.409> about<00:01:27.560> these<00:01:28.009> youngins<00:01:28.369> and

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
unique feature about these youngins and

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.959 
unique feature about these youngins and
classes<00:01:29.030> that<00:01:29.450> these<00:01:29.659> are<00:01:29.930> interlocking<00:01:30.380> bull

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:30.969 
classes that these are interlocking bull

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:34.840 
classes that these are interlocking bull
so<00:01:31.969> you<00:01:32.030> can<00:01:32.270> make<00:01:32.500> 26<00:01:33.500> inches<00:01:33.920> into<00:01:34.219> an<00:01:34.490> 18

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
so you can make 26 inches into an 18

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.420 
so you can make 26 inches into an 18
inch<00:01:35.030> clamp<00:01:35.450> would<00:01:35.719> you<00:01:35.810> believe<00:01:36.159> if<00:01:37.159> I<00:01:37.280> just

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
inch clamp would you believe if I just

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.010 
inch clamp would you believe if I just
post<00:01:37.850> that<00:01:38.060> one<00:01:38.180> over<00:01:38.270> there<00:01:38.570> and<00:01:38.780> show<00:01:38.960> you

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
post that one over there and show you

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.109 
post that one over there and show you
how<00:01:39.049> it<00:01:39.229> works<00:01:39.549> you<00:01:40.549> unlock<00:01:42.850> the<00:01:43.850> locking

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
how it works you unlock the locking

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.660 
how it works you unlock the locking
mechanism<00:01:44.149> and<00:01:45.020> sort<00:01:45.530> of<00:01:45.619> tate<00:01:45.859> the<00:01:46.490> head

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
mechanism and sort of tate the head

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.880 
mechanism and sort of tate the head
upside<00:01:47.119> down<00:01:47.390> so<00:01:47.689> it's<00:01:47.840> facing<00:01:48.020> inwards<00:01:48.649> and

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
upside down so it's facing inwards and

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.770 
upside down so it's facing inwards and
you<00:01:49.640> lock<00:01:50.060> it<00:01:50.270> again<00:01:50.689> to<00:01:51.439> lock<00:01:51.770> mechanism<00:01:52.780> same

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
you lock it again to lock mechanism same

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.770 
you lock it again to lock mechanism same
with<00:01:54.020> the<00:01:54.140> second<00:01:54.560> one<00:01:55.450> exactly<00:01:56.450> the<00:01:56.570> same

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
with the second one exactly the same

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.779 
with the second one exactly the same
motion<00:01:57.289> unlock<00:01:58.960> rotate<00:01:59.960> it<00:02:00.109> upside<00:02:00.469> down<00:02:00.789> so

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
motion unlock rotate it upside down so

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:04.480 
motion unlock rotate it upside down so
it's<00:02:01.939> facing<00:02:02.090> inwards<00:02:02.630> again<00:02:03.560> make<00:02:04.070> sure<00:02:04.130> that

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
it's facing inwards again make sure that

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.929 
it's facing inwards again make sure that
this<00:02:04.549> is<00:02:04.729> locked<00:02:05.000> and<00:02:05.630> then<00:02:06.520> forget<00:02:07.520> the<00:02:07.700> other

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:07.939 
this is locked and then forget the other

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:11.560 
this is locked and then forget the other
on<00:02:08.030> back<00:02:08.270> you've<00:02:09.110> got<00:02:09.410> the<00:02:10.090> mechanism<00:02:11.090> as<00:02:11.330> you

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
on back you've got the mechanism as you

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.080 
on back you've got the mechanism as you
can<00:02:11.660> see<00:02:11.900> that<00:02:12.170> they<00:02:12.320> not<00:02:12.650> together<00:02:12.830> and<00:02:13.280> they

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
can see that they not together and they

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.410 
can see that they not together and they
just<00:02:14.390> slip<00:02:14.990> straight<00:02:15.620> in<00:02:15.860> male<00:02:16.130> to<00:02:16.370> female<00:02:16.420> lot

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
just slip straight in male to female lot

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.860 
just slip straight in male to female lot
straight<00:02:17.870> in<00:02:18.459> so<00:02:19.459> there<00:02:19.700> and<00:02:20.239> now<00:02:20.420> you<00:02:20.480> have

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
straight in so there and now you have

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:38.400 
straight in so there and now you have
an<00:02:22.440> 18-inch<00:02:23.159> clamp<00:02:23.519> from<00:02:23.970> 26<00:02:24.480> inch<00:02:24.690> x
