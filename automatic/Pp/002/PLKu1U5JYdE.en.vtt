00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:10.740
 the singer playing something I 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.750
 I always do one more game is to watch the cids. 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.089
 12min someone will probably say that 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.670
 It's obvious that you have to do it again. 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.010
 because that's not only what you have to do 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.720
 But everyone has blah blah but the 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.180
 The truth is that most people are not 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.980
 not even because we admit we bought itamar 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.930
 of environments between them 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.090
 simply play but forget that you 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.250
 really want to gain these details 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.620
 they do all different then when it starts 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.200
 the match while we got good I 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.300
 tighten tab or click on the enemy 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.700
 and I see which hundreds of them will start 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.559
 someone did not start with orde is this guy 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.870
 which is going to be the first winning leads then 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.030
 lately lacked the respective law 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.770
 His enemy did not buy the word I 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.840
 I'll win there from the minimum you go. 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.910
 can get flash hand in this gang in 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.340
 flash the enemy has two options or he 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.109
 will play retracted until the flash back it 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.760
 You will want to continue playing as late 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.410
 he continues playing as a team you 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.890
 You can use the second tip I'm going to give 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.539
 now 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.460
 usually when the enemy gets big 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.799
 your from the moment you start to 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.479
 go back and go back beyond equal 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.189
 I was walking normally in this 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.290
 moment you simply pretend that 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.330
 fled but actually is expecting a 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.460
 river gap there when it 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.009
 you win again and communications 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.409
 mexico guaranteed if you desmatar and he 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.080
 Then you will help others or 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.240
 Informal I do not know but stay connected when 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.119
 this guy coming back plus he did not 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.890
 bought the word he did not buy the name 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.509
 there again that is the other champion 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.729
 guaranteed 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.880
 there you can be sure that it will start to 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.189
 crying to the chat will talk like amber 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.950
 Copa even leaves here and will find out and 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.840
 reveal but always stays connected in items 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.909
 of your enemies because this tip is good 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.100
 and works for any link and third 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.159
 tip is if the enemy if you are a 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.130
 captive and says types in is 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:02:00.360
 René with le blanc ez 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:03.210
 braga 30 nor etc always plays later 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.149
 that there is that escape ability 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.129
 because then the chance of you killing him 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.080
 dramatically obvious will not have 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.610
 how to escape I will put on the screen how 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:20.160
 difficult for staff to cost 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:22.620
 start when they do not buy ward is this 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.300
 There are three tips that I use 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.730
 When am I doing the devil if you 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.740
 Liked that I liked signing up for the channel 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.300

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.890
