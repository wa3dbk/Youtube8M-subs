about how to tune a guitar there are

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.110 
about how to tune a guitar there are
several<00:00:06.629> ways<00:00:07.140> to<00:00:07.529> go<00:00:07.649> about<00:00:07.680> tuning<00:00:08.519> your

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
several ways to go about tuning your

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.299 
several ways to go about tuning your
guitar<00:00:09.349> first<00:00:10.349> of<00:00:10.500> all<00:00:10.530> you<00:00:10.590> would<00:00:10.860> need<00:00:11.040> a

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
guitar first of all you would need a

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.460 
guitar first of all you would need a
reference<00:00:12.150> pitch<00:00:12.570> to<00:00:13.380> get<00:00:13.559> your<00:00:15.139> first<00:00:16.139> string

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
reference pitch to get your first string

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.740 
reference pitch to get your first string
into<00:00:16.740> tune<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:17.279> then<00:00:17.609> you're<00:00:17.789> going<00:00:18.240> to<00:00:18.539> use

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
into tune and then you're going to use

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.849 
into tune and then you're going to use
that<00:00:19.080> string<00:00:19.640> to<00:00:20.640> as<00:00:20.939> reference<00:00:21.510> point<00:00:21.859> to

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
that string to as reference point to

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.470 
that string to as reference point to
enable<00:00:23.189> yourself<00:00:23.550> to<00:00:23.760> tune<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.090> rest<00:00:24.269> of<00:00:24.390> the

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
enable yourself to tune the rest of the

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.089 
enable yourself to tune the rest of the
strings<00:00:24.810> so<00:00:25.109> you<00:00:25.170> want<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.500> get<00:00:25.590> that<00:00:25.740> from<00:00:25.980> a

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
strings so you want to get that from a

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.920 
strings so you want to get that from a
pitch<00:00:26.310> pipe<00:00:26.580> or<00:00:27.000> you'll<00:00:27.150> want<00:00:27.359> to<00:00:27.480> have<00:00:27.630> some

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
pitch pipe or you'll want to have some

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.139 
pitch pipe or you'll want to have some
kind<00:00:28.170> of<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:30.920> tuner's<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:32.189> lot<00:00:32.489> of<00:00:32.610> times<00:00:32.850> we'll

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
kind of a tuner's a lot of times we'll

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.889 
kind of a tuner's a lot of times we'll
have<00:00:33.450> a<00:00:34.130> you<00:00:35.130> get<00:00:35.309> it<00:00:35.430> if<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:35.820> get<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.360> tuner<00:00:36.780> and

most<00:01:07.049> guitars<00:01:07.229> as<00:01:07.619> you<00:01:07.770> see<00:01:07.920> where<00:01:08.070> there's

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
most guitars as you see where there's

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.609 
most guitars as you see where there's
one<00:01:08.460> here<00:01:08.760> on<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.119> third<00:01:09.420> Brett<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.320> on<00:01:10.470> the

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
one here on the third Brett and on the

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.000 
one here on the third Brett and on the
fifth<00:01:11.090> so<00:01:12.090> it's<00:01:12.240> easy<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.630> find<00:01:12.869> so<00:01:13.710> here<00:01:13.890> you

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
fifth so it's easy to find so here you

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.429 
fifth so it's easy to find so here you
are<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.580> go<00:01:14.760> up<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.299> fifth<00:01:15.659> fret<00:01:15.900> on<00:01:16.200> your

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
are you go up to the fifth fret on your

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.750 
are you go up to the fifth fret on your
e<00:01:16.619> string<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.250> play<00:01:17.460> your<00:01:17.640> note

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:20.760 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.400 

now<00:01:21.500> you're<00:01:22.500> going<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:23.040> strike<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:23.700> note<00:01:24.410> you

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:25.410 
now you're going to strike that note you

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.040 
now you're going to strike that note you
want<00:01:25.620> to<00:01:25.710> listen<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.780> you<00:01:27.780> want<00:01:27.960> to

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.050 
want to listen to it and you want to

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.680 
want to listen to it and you want to
understand<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.680> pitch<00:01:28.890> is<00:01:29.280> clear<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.150> what

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 
understand the pitch is clear and what

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.240 
understand the pitch is clear and what
the<00:01:31.080> pitch<00:01:32.360> of<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:34.050> note<00:01:34.350> is<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.860> then

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
the pitch of that note is and then

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.450 
the pitch of that note is and then
you're<00:01:35.580> going<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:36.830> play<00:01:37.830> your<00:01:38.010> a<00:01:38.070> string

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
you're going to play your a string

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.120 
you're going to play your a string
alongside<00:01:38.940> it<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.750> you'll<00:01:40.500> notice<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.860> that

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
alongside it and you'll notice that that

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.110 
alongside it and you'll notice that that
is<00:01:41.310> quite<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.030> bit<00:01:42.270> lower<00:01:43.700> there's<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.940> pitch

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:45.120 
is quite a bit lower there's the pitch

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.220 
is quite a bit lower there's the pitch
we<00:01:45.300> need<00:01:46.220> there's<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.430> pitch<00:01:47.580> we're<00:01:47.790> hearing

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:48.230 
we need there's the pitch we're hearing

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:53.270 
we need there's the pitch we're hearing
so<00:01:49.230> we<00:01:49.410> can<00:01:49.590> bring<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:49.980> up<00:01:51.740> until<00:01:52.740> we<00:01:52.920> hear<00:01:53.130> it

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
so we can bring it up until we hear it

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.670 
so we can bring it up until we hear it
sounding<00:01:53.910> similar<00:01:54.210> now<00:01:55.050> you<00:01:55.110> want<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.410> repeat

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
sounding similar now you want to repeat

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.820 
sounding similar now you want to repeat
the<00:01:55.800> process<00:01:55.979> on<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.550> a<00:01:56.580> string<00:01:57.560> one<00:01:58.560> two

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
the process on the a string one two

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.710 
the process on the a string one two
three<00:01:58.860> four<00:01:59.190> five<00:02:02.150> there's<00:02:03.150> the<00:02:03.360> pitch<00:02:03.540> we

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
three four five there's the pitch we

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.870 
three four five there's the pitch we
need<00:02:03.930> for<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.229> D<00:02:04.380> string<00:02:07.369> here<00:02:08.369> it's<00:02:08.520> also<00:02:08.700> a

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
need for the D string here it's also a

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:16.900 
need for the D string here it's also a
little<00:02:09.060> flat

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:23.920 

so<00:02:17.910> we<00:02:18.060> turn<00:02:18.270> it<00:02:18.420> up<00:02:18.540> let's<00:02:18.870> see<00:02:19.170> if<00:02:19.260> it<00:02:19.410> matches

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.440 

it's<00:02:24.500> pretty<00:02:24.739> good<00:02:24.980> and<00:02:25.700> we<00:02:25.849> go<00:02:25.969> ahead<00:02:26.299> and

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
it's pretty good and we go ahead and

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.440 
it's pretty good and we go ahead and
continue<00:02:26.780> up<00:02:27.349> the<00:02:27.379> D<00:02:27.829> string<00:02:28.040> 1<00:02:28.310> 2<00:02:28.519> 3<00:02:28.549> 4<00:02:28.790> 5<00:02:29.209> and

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
continue up the D string 1 2 3 4 5 and

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.690 
continue up the D string 1 2 3 4 5 and
now<00:02:29.569> we'll<00:02:30.049> have<00:02:30.230> a<00:02:30.260> G<00:02:30.620> this<00:02:31.129> is<00:02:31.280> what<00:02:31.400> our<00:02:31.430> g

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
now we'll have a G this is what our g
