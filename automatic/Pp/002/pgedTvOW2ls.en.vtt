00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:08.540
 hello everyone this is an indoor video 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.540
 of the channel gold hunter spartan 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:15.690
 let's start with a close-up on the 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:20.070
 identification plate there is one for 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:23.100
 each side applied is particular 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.320
 I like it even if it's a quirk 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.900
 particularly 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:30.349
 then we can see in all his 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.349
 length 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:38.219
 the channel the gold hunter spartan 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:40.829
 Spartan model as you know I chose 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.320
 this name precisely because of its qualities 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.970
 why 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:48.350
 and very simple and spartan precisely but 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.200
 effective 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:55.790
 then let's start with the measurements for a moment 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:01:02.210
 the length of the spartan is 82 cm 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:07.180
 width is 20 the thousand layer 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:11.630
 lines and 50 centimeters really 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:16.100
 abundant this layer as already mentioned 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:20.030
 and as witnessed in the video he did 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.289
 Sunday on the river holds everything back 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.320
 everything Everything 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:26.060
 and what eventually for one 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.330
 current a little strong and so on 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:33.170
 can fly away from here meet and jump 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:35.899
 from a centimeter and goes to finish straight 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.420
 straight in the miner moss or moss of the 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:40.670
 miner how to say it 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:43.490
 the length of the miner mons 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:48.140
 altogether these alchemies of 25 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:49.909
 centimeters then we have the exit 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.210
 overhang of the jump 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:56.689
 its base here here chips can be 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:02:01.009
 form any deposits in material 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:04.909
 heavy and then the rubber carpet 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:07.250
 let's say large with a 5 cm wide texture 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:11.170
 piece that goes to favor the 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.170
 waterfall at the water outlet 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:18.200
 I wanted to make a premise the channel 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:22.360
 this initially holds everything back 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:25.610
 channel was 40 centimeters longer 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.660
 the surplus was all done 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.310
 so 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.680
 and it was designed that way 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.530
 to possibly test the 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.980
 dispersion of precious metal which 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:40.370
 maybe you could escape the thousand lines e 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.410
 to the moss of the miner the tests of 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.140
 dispersion were made by putting in 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.640
 water a bucket with stones that 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.650
 he went to collect all the material 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.900
 which was to say falling from the 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.439
 waterfall at the end of the day 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:58.099
 was passed 

00:02:53.439 --> 00:03:00.879
 was passed based on and then i 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:04.060
 results were completely successful 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:07.450
 positive in the sense that he did not run away 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.450
 practically nothing 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:17.060
 having said that we pass to the moss of the 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:24.040
 miner to remove it enough 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:27.130
 simply take pull out from below 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:32.960
 the base of the salt 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:34.100
 ok very easy then we remove it 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.650
 we're going to rinse in a bucket 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.090
 etc. etc. 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.480
 we can see how particular of the 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.480
 pennies 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:49.070
 ok then to put it back is a moment 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:52.640
 we put below here and there we put below 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:55.960
 this way if we want to avoid even 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:59.260
 small curls of my name of that 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:02.390
 run away we use a phone card 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:05.470
 to perfectly fit everything underneath 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:07.160
 but with my fingers I do the work 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:11.030
 in a moment 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:14.450
 ok the material of which is composed 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:19.600
 gold hunter h is yes sorry the gold antea 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:23.419
 spartan is stainless steel 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:26.300
 the difference between a channel in 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:29.390
 steel and aluminum is a lot 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:33.480
 simple one in steel when the 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:35.550
 square is more stable than aluminum 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:40.040
 obviously maybe he needs some 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:42.840
 extra stone to be stabilized 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.640
 not to run short bones also 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.860
 go into the river 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:50.190
 therefore to the advantage of being even more 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:52.980
 very few are actually used 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:57.330
 tricks to stabilize it years 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:05:00.890
 river and this is another point we say 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:06.300
 in my opinion of the strength of this channel 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:09.890
 well I think it's all there for you today 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.890
 greeting I refer you to the next
