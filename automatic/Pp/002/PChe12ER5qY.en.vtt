00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.670
 you 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:53.230
 what annoys me of the time 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.019
 extraordinary if we mark in Dordogne 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:01:01.930
 the biggest evolution of the story 1 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:01.930
 against 1 chems to and mysticism 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.510
 in the zorro written there is already strong 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.930
 long time 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.460
 rabbi shimon bar yohai had announced that 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.830
 just before the final issue 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.560
 not only science since it is 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:48.520
 that it was not opposed to 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.410
 understanding of existence such 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.140
 that the Torah speaks about it but that more 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:55.750
 still that science will become the friend 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.420
 the partner of the reconstruction of the world 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.600
 and his return to the master of the 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.600
 world 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.230
 reason that we find more and more 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:13.870
 of Jews and even of the Jew who comes to 

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:15.910
 prove prove unveiling this connection between 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.150
 these two dimensions which are the 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.920
 morning dimension the spiritual dimension 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.020
 one of these people is the author of the 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.150
 book 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.489
 the Jewish dna that I had the opportunity to 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.069
 browse and that strongly influenced me 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:32.890
 impressed and that of course I you 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:35.430
 will discover by reading and 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.430
 the student 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.720
 suppose a genius a giant of the torah 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.510
 who would go for 24 hours and 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.819
 more to think meditate but without opening 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.550
 the mouth without speaking would not happen 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:00.620
 this study has turned anything 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.120
 is neither the world nor even 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.400
 louise and as it was a study 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.980
 sterile ie unable to 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.349
 produce to change influenced but at 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.920
 contrary if this man goes during his 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:11.959
 study 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.640
 that's for a few minutes 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.860
 talk about what he's doing 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.959
 to study that will give a cracked it's going 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.880
 give a reality a force to this 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.580
 study have not that all of a sudden this 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:25.010
 energy will start acting up 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:28.150
 transform the man who studies and the 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.150
 world is around him 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.069
 if one of the most 

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:37.099
 extraordinary in my opinion what is 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:39.650
 highlighted in this book that everything 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:42.819
 the world has the possibility and maybe 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.819
 but see the duty to read 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:57.170
 because he was born conscious is bright 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.599
 to relive the scenario 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:02.870
 he also counts trichet an attempt to 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:04.610
 integration and rachid type scandals 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.909
