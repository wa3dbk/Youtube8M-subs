00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.710
 by the way 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:20.150
 good to all I'm punch and well I 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.489
 I bring here a zombie trick of 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.590
 whites 2 only works for xbox is what 

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:27.500
 bad for play according to what I have been told 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:30.739
 it works and good for it we are going to 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.659
 need two things we need a 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:35.570
 program so you stay lagazós and 

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:37.610
 another command from xbox if we do not go to 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.530
 power and good we give the X a 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.809
 Once we are here in the menu of the 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.870
 zombies we put that privacy open and 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:46.070
 holes in one group only once 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.320
 we have done it we go to games 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.799
 personalized and we put in note that 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.019
 we want and we add the voice command once 

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:56.780
 that we have in fact activated the lizard 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:59.150
 of the program we put it on the level that 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.739
 it comes out in the letters orange 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.579
 we go back and we will miss a 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:07.159
 error when we jump the error tells us 

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:08.630
 that you can make such mistakes because 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.610
 we are with two more we have put one 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.670
 more is good once we have been jumped 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.979
 we give it back to 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.570
 to personalized games and we will leave 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:18.549
 this black screen you have seen of 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.590
 charge one this health the only screen 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:22.530
 of load we give back to the program 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.689
 of the files and we give him to stop 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.680
 and well the trick is done 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:31.230
 we remove the golf controller if you want 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.659
 and here when we are already at the point of 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.520
 meeting 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.049
 there have to be only four people 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.819
 to start the game once 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:40.280
 we started the game from four 

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:42.350
 people can then join the 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.569
 four more and we can play others 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.100
 transit modes and good nothing else if you 

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:48.720
 liked the video vote I like it and 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.610
 comment and until next time 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.470
 good as you have seen that was the 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.870
 explanation that has given poché of what 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.520
 is the trick in xbox you know that 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.440
 it only works for xbox it seems 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.450
 complicated but not complicated 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.010
 pretty easy and good as I was 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.480
 also in that game we were 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.880
 enough people in that game eight 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.710
 people as you see good simply 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.119
 Well, that capture of now and I feel like 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.830
 I wanted to record some little things 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.120
 some fragments and here as you see 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.040
 we are on the bus I do not know how many 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.520
 we are but we are more than four that 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.500
 sure and nobody am I there we were there good 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.930
 so recording some little things here as 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.060
 you see the same thing the box did not break a 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.720
 moment everyone there like vultures to buy 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.700
 the box and nothing will you see that there is a 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.780
 lots of people there buying there the 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.000
 weapons 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.340
 a bunch of rock around here spinning 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.780
 it was simply that he did not want to 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.680
 teach some fragments that are 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.530
 recording this afternoon 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.090
 and little else is worth as you have seen 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.709
 Well, I have been applying it 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.209
 well we had already agreed that he 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.550
 explained the trick and well I recorded 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.050
