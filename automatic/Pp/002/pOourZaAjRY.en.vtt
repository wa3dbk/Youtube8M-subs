00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.080 

we'll<00:00:40.620> break<00:00:40.800> it<00:00:40.950> down<00:00:40.980> slowly<00:00:41.460> first<00:00:41.850> and

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
we'll break it down slowly first and

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.180 
we'll break it down slowly first and
then<00:00:42.180> work<00:00:42.330> up<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.630> speed<00:00:42.900> so<00:00:43.830> let's<00:00:44.010> start

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
then work up the speed so let's start

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.890 
then work up the speed so let's start
with<00:00:44.280> your<00:00:44.400> first<00:00:44.580> finger<00:00:45.000> on<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.150> c-note<00:00:45.660> on

the second string and you pull it off
and<00:00:49.480> then<00:00:49.629> get<00:00:49.809> the<00:00:49.930> b-flat<00:00:50.320> note<00:00:50.649> on<00:00:50.800> the

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
and then get the b-flat note on the

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.650 
and then get the b-flat note on the
third<00:00:51.129> string<00:00:51.460> and<00:00:51.519> let<00:00:51.760> the<00:00:51.879> notes<00:00:52.059> ring<00:00:52.359> into

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
third string and let the notes ring into

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.180 
third string and let the notes ring into
each<00:00:52.809> other<00:00:53.050> like<00:00:53.289> this<00:00:55.769> you<00:00:56.769> get<00:00:56.890> that<00:00:56.949> little

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
each other like this you get that little

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.590 
each other like this you get that little
dissonance

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
dissonance

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.780 
dissonance
and<00:01:00.079> then<00:01:00.260> pick<00:01:00.530> the<00:01:00.560> second<00:01:01.040> string<00:01:01.280> again<00:01:01.550> so

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:01.790 
and then pick the second string again so

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.759 
and then pick the second string again so
you've<00:01:01.940> got<00:01:02.120> this

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.740 

and<00:01:04.920> then<00:01:05.400> do<00:01:05.550> a<00:01:05.580> nice<00:01:05.820> little<00:01:06.030> pull-off<00:01:06.420> on

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
the third-string starting on the B flat

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.690 
the third-string starting on the B flat
so<00:01:10.530> it's<00:01:10.650> B<00:01:10.830> flat<00:01:11.100> 8<00:01:11.400> open<00:01:11.940> G<00:01:12.830> and<00:01:13.830> then<00:01:14.550> do<00:01:14.670> a

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
so it's B flat 8 open G and then do a

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.340 
so it's B flat 8 open G and then do a
pull<00:01:15.000> off<00:01:15.180> on<00:01:15.480> the<00:01:15.720> 4th<00:01:16.080> string<00:01:16.380> e<00:01:16.620> to<00:01:16.740> open<00:01:17.190> D

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
pull off on the 4th string e to open D

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:26.359 
pull off on the 4th string e to open D
so<00:01:19.350> so<00:01:19.530> far<00:01:19.710> we've<00:01:19.950> got<00:01:20.130> this<00:01:25.100> okay<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.280> then

so so far we've got this okay and then

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.030 
so so far we've got this okay and then
hit<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.700> open<00:01:27.060> g<00:01:27.240> string<00:01:27.290> and<00:01:28.290> then<00:01:28.619> slide<00:01:29.010> up

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
hit the open g string and then slide up

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.270
