00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.880 

so<00:00:10.880> this<00:00:11.330> is

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:11.890 
so this is

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:14.900 
so this is
demonstration<00:00:12.580> that<00:00:12.610> I<00:00:12.880> promised<00:00:13.360> you<00:00:13.510> and

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
demonstration that I promised you and

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.240 
demonstration that I promised you and
this<00:00:15.910> is<00:00:16.090> basically<00:00:16.480> where<00:00:17.320> we're<00:00:17.860> talking

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:18.250 
this is basically where we're talking

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.550 
this is basically where we're talking
about<00:00:18.370> the<00:00:18.640> momentum<00:00:19.150> transferred<00:00:19.810> how<00:00:20.500> to

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:20.560 
about the momentum transferred how to

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.170 
about the momentum transferred how to
transfer<00:00:21.070> momentum<00:00:21.190> to<00:00:21.700> water<00:00:21.910> water

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:22.180 
transfer momentum to water water

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.310 
transfer momentum to water water
basically<00:00:24.300> actually<00:00:25.300> carries<00:00:25.600> a<00:00:25.630> mention<00:00:26.140> in

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:26.320 
basically actually carries a mention in

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.070 
basically actually carries a mention in
so<00:00:26.980> one<00:00:27.340> of<00:00:27.369> the<00:00:27.550> last<00:00:28.180> questions<00:00:28.750> of<00:00:28.869> lecture

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.080 
so one of the last questions of lecture

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.589 
so one of the last questions of lecture
Melissa<00:00:29.650> well<00:00:29.770> what<00:00:29.919> happens<00:00:30.160> to<00:00:30.220> be<00:00:30.340> hit<00:00:30.490> a

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
Melissa well what happens to be hit a

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.930 
Melissa well what happens to be hit a
glass<00:00:31.599> bottle<00:00:32.020> with<00:00:32.110> a<00:00:32.140> hammer<00:00:32.790> you<00:00:33.790> don't

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:33.940 
glass bottle with a hammer you don't

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.330 
glass bottle with a hammer you don't
want<00:00:34.060> to<00:00:34.120> do<00:00:34.180> this<00:00:34.300> at<00:00:34.450> home<00:00:34.800> really<00:00:35.800> you<00:00:36.190> know

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.340 
want to do this at home really you know

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.240 
want to do this at home really you know
it's<00:00:36.670> kind<00:00:37.000> of<00:00:37.120> fun<00:00:37.360> but<00:00:37.630> you<00:00:37.780> need<00:00:37.930> the

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
it's kind of fun but you need the

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.180 
it's kind of fun but you need the
basically<00:00:39.250> a<00:00:39.900> rubber<00:00:40.900> hammer<00:00:41.140> and<00:00:41.860> he<00:00:41.950> really

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
basically a rubber hammer and he really

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.130 
basically a rubber hammer and he really
should<00:00:42.370> have<00:00:42.520> some<00:00:42.730> work<00:00:42.880> plus<00:00:43.150> I<00:00:43.450> haven't

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
should have some work plus I haven't

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.080 
should have some work plus I haven't
haven't<00:00:44.620> shattered<00:00:45.129> a<00:00:45.250> glass<00:00:45.280> yet<00:00:45.789> but<00:00:46.030> I

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.090 
haven't shattered a glass yet but I

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.170 
haven't shattered a glass yet but I
would<00:00:46.239> really<00:00:46.480> want<00:00:46.539> to<00:00:47.760> hopefully<00:00:48.760> this

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
would really want to hopefully this

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.900 
would really want to hopefully this
won't<00:00:49.329> happen<00:00:49.510> now<00:00:50.469> let's<00:00:50.859> just<00:00:51.039> show<00:00:51.699> what

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
won't happen now let's just show what

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.360 
won't happen now let's just show what
happens<00:00:52.269> with<00:00:52.420> the<00:00:52.570> first<00:00:52.809> one<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:54.070> idea<00:00:54.309> is

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
happens with the first one the idea is

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.430 
happens with the first one the idea is
that<00:00:54.430> you<00:00:54.579> hit<00:00:55.059> it<00:00:55.210> you<00:00:55.359> can<00:00:55.930> actually<00:00:56.050> kind<00:00:56.379> of

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
that you hit it you can actually kind of

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:07.560 
that you hit it you can actually kind of
hear<00:00:56.649> it<00:00:58.649> here<00:00:59.649> at<00:00:59.679> teen<00:01:05.370> and<00:01:06.370> you<00:01:07.210> can<00:01:07.360> see

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
hear it here at teen and you can see

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.840 
hear it here at teen and you can see
that<00:01:07.600> basically<00:01:08.140> it<00:01:08.380> breaks<00:01:08.680> pretty<00:01:09.580> cleanly

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
that basically it breaks pretty cleanly

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.820 
that basically it breaks pretty cleanly
actually<00:01:10.390> only<00:01:10.630> the<00:01:10.780> one<00:01:10.960> side<00:01:11.320> basically

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
actually only the one side basically

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.679 
actually only the one side basically
broke<00:01:12.100> off<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:14.590> so<00:01:15.130> the<00:01:15.939> question<00:01:16.360> that<00:01:16.390> one

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:16.689 
broke off and so the question that one

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:19.410 
broke off and so the question that one
you<00:01:17.200> know<00:01:17.350> could<00:01:17.500> ask<00:01:17.650> yourself<00:01:18.040> is<00:01:18.250> well<00:01:18.490> why

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
you know could ask yourself is well why

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:30.889 
you know could ask yourself is well why
does<00:01:19.900> it<00:01:20.049> do<00:01:20.229> that<00:01:20.259> and<00:01:26.369> my<00:01:27.369> writing<00:01:27.790> pen<00:01:29.399> and

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:30.899 
does it do that and my writing pen and

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:33.780 
does it do that and my writing pen and
the<00:01:31.899> idea<00:01:32.259> is<00:01:32.350> that<00:01:32.799> when<00:01:33.220> you<00:01:33.399> have<00:01:33.579> this

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
the idea is that when you have this

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:39.899 
the idea is that when you have this
glass<00:01:34.090> bottle<00:01:36.869> you<00:01:37.869> know<00:01:37.930> it's<00:01:38.079> got<00:01:38.200> a<00:01:38.259> lid<00:01:38.909> in

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
glass bottle you know it's got a lid in

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:47.219 
glass bottle you know it's got a lid in
the<00:01:40.450> glass<00:01:40.750> bottles<00:01:41.170> down<00:01:41.350> here<00:01:45.420> when<00:01:46.420> you<00:01:46.570> hit

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
the glass bottles down here when you hit

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.990 
the glass bottles down here when you hit
it<00:01:47.350> with<00:01:47.469> the<00:01:47.500> hammer<00:01:49.740> like<00:01:50.740> this<00:01:51.040> you<00:01:51.700> know<00:01:51.790> so

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
it with the hammer like this you know so

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.609 
it with the hammer like this you know so
you're<00:01:52.180> basically<00:01:52.540> forcing<00:01:53.259> the<00:01:53.350> hammer<00:01:53.500> down

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
you're basically forcing the hammer down

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:56.490 
you're basically forcing the hammer down
onto<00:01:54.100> the<00:01:54.280> glass<00:01:54.610> bottle<00:01:55.110> what<00:01:56.110> you're<00:01:56.259> doing

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
onto the glass bottle what you're doing

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.260 
onto the glass bottle what you're doing
is<00:01:56.619> that<00:01:56.770> you're<00:01:57.009> essentially<00:01:57.700> transferring

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
is that you're essentially transferring

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.420 
is that you're essentially transferring
laments<00:01:58.600> them<00:01:58.750> to<00:01:59.439> the<00:01:59.560> glass<00:01:59.740> bottle<00:02:00.100> itself

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
laments them to the glass bottle itself

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.789 
laments them to the glass bottle itself
and<00:02:00.729> so<00:02:01.600> the<00:02:01.719> point<00:02:01.899> is<00:02:02.049> is<00:02:02.350> that<00:02:02.380> the<00:02:02.619> glass

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
and so the point is is that the glass

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:05.789 
and so the point is is that the glass
bottle<00:02:03.250> clearly<00:02:03.610> moves<00:02:03.820> down<00:02:04.140> in<00:02:05.140> reaction<00:02:05.770> to

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
bottle clearly moves down in reaction to

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:08.370 
bottle clearly moves down in reaction to
the<00:02:06.130> impulse<00:02:06.490> provided<00:02:07.090> by<00:02:07.180> the<00:02:07.240> hammer<00:02:07.509> but

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
the impulse provided by the hammer but

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.590 
the impulse provided by the hammer but
the<00:02:08.500> problem<00:02:08.890> is<00:02:09.039> is<00:02:09.250> that<00:02:09.280> the<00:02:09.550> water<00:02:09.789> you

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
the problem is is that the water you

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.240 
the problem is is that the water you
know<00:02:10.690> this<00:02:10.869> enclosed<00:02:11.350> case<00:02:11.560> this<00:02:11.740> ice<00:02:11.950> tea

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
know this enclosed case this ice tea

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.210 
know this enclosed case this ice tea
which<00:02:12.460> is<00:02:12.610> sitting<00:02:12.880> here<00:02:13.090> um<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:15.190> only

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
which is sitting here um the only

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.220 
which is sitting here um the only
interactions<00:02:15.820> it<00:02:15.940> has<00:02:16.120> a<00:02:16.150> bottle<00:02:16.690> basically

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
interactions it has a bottle basically

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.410 
interactions it has a bottle basically
are<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:17.650> the<00:02:18.010> sort<00:02:18.250> of<00:02:18.340> viscous<00:02:18.730> interactions

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
are the the sort of viscous interactions

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.020 
are the the sort of viscous interactions
with<00:02:19.570> the<00:02:19.690> wall<00:02:19.870> and<00:02:20.190> so<00:02:21.190> effectively<00:02:21.730> the

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
with the wall and so effectively the

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.180 
with the wall and so effectively the
glass<00:02:22.239> bottle<00:02:22.629> moves<00:02:22.840> down<00:02:23.080> and<00:02:23.440> the<00:02:23.620> inertia

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
glass bottle moves down and the inertia

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.940 
glass bottle moves down and the inertia
of<00:02:24.400> the

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
of the

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.670 
of the
water<00:02:25.040> since<00:02:25.520> he<00:02:25.610> remains<00:02:25.910> keeps<00:02:26.330> it<00:02:26.450> in<00:02:26.540> place

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
water since he remains keeps it in place

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.729 
water since he remains keeps it in place
now<00:02:27.680> up<00:02:27.980> here<00:02:28.040> you've<00:02:28.580> got<00:02:28.610> air<00:02:29.180> and<00:02:29.560> say<00:02:30.560> what

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
now up here you've got air and say what

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.150 
now up here you've got air and say what
happens<00:02:31.160> is<00:02:31.340> is<00:02:31.580> that<00:02:31.849> this<00:02:32.300> compresses

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
happens is is that this compresses

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.520 
happens is is that this compresses
basically<00:02:34.160> as<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:34.340> bottle<00:02:34.640> moves<00:02:34.849> down<00:02:35.530> and

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
basically as the bottle moves down and

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.500 
basically as the bottle moves down and
so<00:02:36.739> then<00:02:36.920> sometime<00:02:37.370> later<00:02:37.420> essentially<00:02:38.420> what

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
so then sometime later essentially what

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.839 
so then sometime later essentially what
you<00:02:38.690> have<00:02:38.900> is<00:02:39.530> because<00:02:39.830> this<00:02:40.160> now<00:02:40.370> builds<00:02:40.640> up<00:02:40.730> a

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:40.849 
you have is because this now builds up a

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:43.559 
you have is because this now builds up a
significant<00:02:41.480> pressure<00:02:41.690> is<00:02:42.069> that<00:02:43.069> this

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
significant pressure is that this

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:46.600 
significant pressure is that this
suddenly<00:02:44.569> reacts<00:02:45.380> by<00:02:45.890> because<00:02:46.220> the<00:02:46.340> pressure

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
suddenly reacts by because the pressure

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.449 
suddenly reacts by because the pressure
can<00:02:47.090> exert<00:02:47.720> a<00:02:47.780> force<00:02:47.900> on<00:02:48.260> the<00:02:48.380> liquid<00:02:48.680> is<00:02:49.220> it

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
can exert a force on the liquid is it

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.930 
can exert a force on the liquid is it
eventually<00:02:49.640> the<00:02:50.150> the<00:02:51.069> the<00:02:52.069> pressure<00:02:52.400> drives

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
eventually the the the pressure drives

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.900 
eventually the the the pressure drives
the<00:02:53.330> fluid<00:02:53.750> downwards<00:02:54.310> but<00:02:55.310> now<00:02:55.519> the<00:02:55.549> problem

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
the fluid downwards but now the problem

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.390 
the fluid downwards but now the problem
is<00:02:56.150> that<00:02:56.209> you<00:02:56.420> got<00:02:56.569> the<00:02:56.690> fluid<00:02:56.989> moving<00:02:57.400> but

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
is that you got the fluid moving but

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.699 
is that you got the fluid moving but
there's<00:02:58.849> nothing<00:02:59.299> really<00:02:59.450> to<00:02:59.569> stop<00:03:00.260> it<00:03:00.470> from

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
there's nothing really to stop it from

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.670 
there's nothing really to stop it from
moving<00:03:00.769> except<00:03:01.430> for<00:03:01.610> the<00:03:01.730> bottom<00:03:01.910> and<00:03:02.410> so<00:03:03.410> once

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
moving except for the bottom and so once

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.800 
moving except for the bottom and so once
again<00:03:03.890> in<00:03:04.340> order<00:03:04.640> to<00:03:04.670> stop<00:03:05.000> it<00:03:05.180> moving<00:03:05.360> because

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
again in order to stop it moving because

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.050 
again in order to stop it moving because
eventually<00:03:06.079> it<00:03:06.290> has<00:03:06.410> to<00:03:06.560> come<00:03:06.590> to<00:03:06.860> rest<00:03:07.099> is<00:03:07.370> it

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
eventually it has to come to rest is it

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.020 
eventually it has to come to rest is it
the<00:03:08.329> pressure<00:03:08.720> at<00:03:09.500> the<00:03:09.799> bottom<00:03:09.829> of<00:03:10.340> the<00:03:10.760> fluid

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
the pressure at the bottom of the fluid

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.660 
the pressure at the bottom of the fluid
basically<00:03:11.630> has<00:03:11.780> to<00:03:11.959> skyrocket<00:03:12.620> and<00:03:13.190> so<00:03:13.519> what

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
basically has to skyrocket and so what

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.370 
basically has to skyrocket and so what
that<00:03:13.700> means<00:03:14.060> though<00:03:14.299> is<00:03:14.329> that<00:03:14.660> there<00:03:15.019> has<00:03:15.079> to

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
that means though is that there has to

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.130 
that means though is that there has to
be<00:03:15.410> an<00:03:15.560> equal<00:03:15.799> and<00:03:15.829> opposite<00:03:16.280> pressure<00:03:16.519> on<00:03:17.140> the

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
be an equal and opposite pressure on the

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.940 
be an equal and opposite pressure on the
glass<00:03:18.769> and<00:03:19.690> so<00:03:20.690> there's<00:03:21.110> a<00:03:21.170> force<00:03:21.530> on<00:03:21.739> the

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
glass and so there's a force on the

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.770 
glass and so there's a force on the
glass<00:03:22.250> bottom<00:03:22.549> which<00:03:22.940> is<00:03:22.970> be<00:03:23.329> equal<00:03:23.540> to<00:03:23.660> the

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
glass bottom which is be equal to the

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.330 
glass bottom which is be equal to the
pressure<00:03:23.959> types<00:03:24.319> of<00:03:24.470> cross-sectional<00:03:24.950> area

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
pressure types of cross-sectional area

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.460 
pressure types of cross-sectional area
and<00:03:25.760> since<00:03:26.420> the<00:03:26.540> cross-sectional<00:03:27.019> area<00:03:27.260> is<00:03:27.349> so

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
and since the cross-sectional area is so

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:28.960 
and since the cross-sectional area is so
big<00:03:27.709> down<00:03:27.950> here<00:03:28.220> you<00:03:28.430> can<00:03:28.579> actually<00:03:28.819> get<00:03:28.910> a

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
big down here you can actually get a

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.780 
big down here you can actually get a
significant<00:03:29.660> force<00:03:30.010> and<00:03:31.010> so<00:03:31.190> what<00:03:31.340> happens<00:03:31.639> is

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
significant force and so what happens is

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.340 
significant force and so what happens is
rather<00:03:32.000> than<00:03:32.269> the<00:03:32.480> bottom<00:03:32.810> actually<00:03:33.109> sort<00:03:33.319> of

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
rather than the bottom actually sort of

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.349 
rather than the bottom actually sort of
exploding<00:03:33.889> outwards<00:03:34.250> it<00:03:34.940> could<00:03:35.060> pretty<00:03:35.239> much

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:35.359 
exploding outwards it could pretty much

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:39.729 
exploding outwards it could pretty much
Sears<00:03:35.840> off<00:03:36.079> the<00:03:36.889> volume<00:03:37.069> of<00:03:37.340> the<00:03:37.430> glass<00:03:38.739> so

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
Sears off the volume of the glass so

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:46.210 
Sears off the volume of the glass so
just<00:03:41.109> 22<00:03:42.109> let's<00:03:42.530> look<00:03:42.680> at<00:03:42.799> that<00:03:42.920> again<00:03:45.220> and

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
just 22 let's look at that again and

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.390 
just 22 let's look at that again and
here's<00:03:46.579> another<00:03:47.019> bottle<00:03:48.019> and<00:03:48.170> again<00:03:49.040> you<00:03:49.310> want

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
here's another bottle and again you want

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.849 
here's another bottle and again you want
to<00:03:49.519> be<00:03:49.579> careful<00:03:49.760> about<00:03:50.000> how<00:03:50.180> you<00:03:50.209> hit<00:03:50.450> it<00:03:50.569> you

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:50.859 
to be careful about how you hit it you

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:53.710 
to be careful about how you hit it you
can<00:03:51.859> hear<00:03:52.069> it<00:03:52.190> ting<00:03:52.489> and<00:03:52.790> that<00:03:52.940> essentially<00:03:53.450> is

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
can hear it ting and that essentially is

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.870 
can hear it ting and that essentially is
the<00:03:54.590> ting<00:03:55.010> is<00:03:55.040> the<00:03:55.670> you<00:03:56.060> know<00:03:56.180> the<00:03:57.519> air<00:03:58.519> since

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
the ting is the you know the air since

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.870 
the ting is the you know the air since
you're<00:03:59.030> getting<00:03:59.209> compressed<00:04:00.340> and<00:04:01.340> so<00:04:01.579> as<00:04:01.730> you

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
you're getting compressed and so as you

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:09.129 
you're getting compressed and so as you
whack<00:04:02.420> it<00:04:06.549> eventually<00:04:07.569> it<00:04:08.569> just<00:04:08.599> breaks<00:04:08.870> off

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:09.139 
whack it eventually it just breaks off

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:10.750 
whack it eventually it just breaks off
and<00:04:09.170> this<00:04:09.410> time<00:04:09.620> it<00:04:09.739> actually<00:04:09.859> shared<00:04:10.310> almost

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
and this time it actually shared almost

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.349 
and this time it actually shared almost
beautifully<00:04:11.389> off<00:04:12.730> and<00:04:13.730> you<00:04:13.819> can<00:04:13.880> see<00:04:14.060> just<00:04:14.090> a

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:14.359 
beautifully off and you can see just a

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:18.969 
beautifully off and you can see just a
clean<00:04:14.599> break<00:04:14.810> all<00:04:15.109> the<00:04:15.230> way<00:04:15.349> down<00:04:17.979> your

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:18.979 
clean break all the way down your

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:22.089 
clean break all the way down your
bottles<00:04:19.340> work<00:04:19.489> really<00:04:19.669> well<00:04:19.760> in<00:04:20.000> fact<00:04:21.099> but

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:22.099 
bottles work really well in fact but

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:23.980 
bottles work really well in fact but
with<00:04:22.849> these<00:04:22.970> eyes<00:04:23.120> two<00:04:23.300> bottles<00:04:23.630> hard<00:04:23.780> to<00:04:23.840> find

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
with these eyes two bottles hard to find

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.719 
with these eyes two bottles hard to find
glass<00:04:24.169> bottles<00:04:24.530> anymore<00:04:24.740> but<00:04:25.430> these<00:04:25.550> work

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:25.729 
glass bottles anymore but these work

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:28.870 
glass bottles anymore but these work
pretty<00:04:25.940> well<00:04:26.620> so<00:04:27.620> that's<00:04:27.800> the<00:04:27.950> last<00:04:28.639> thing

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
pretty well so that's the last thing

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.150 
pretty well so that's the last thing
that<00:04:29.060> we're<00:04:29.270> going<00:04:29.360> to<00:04:29.419> talk<00:04:29.599> about<00:04:30.160> this

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
that we're going to talk about this

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.310 
that we're going to talk about this
quarter<00:04:31.520> and<00:04:31.940> so<00:04:32.210> the<00:04:32.360> idea<00:04:32.479> is<00:04:32.720> that<00:04:33.020> water

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
quarter and so the idea is that water

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.480 
quarter and so the idea is that water
carries<00:04:33.770> momentum<00:04:34.250> and<00:04:34.400> so<00:04:35.360> trying<00:04:36.260> to

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
carries momentum and so trying to

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
carries momentum and so trying to
basically

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
basically

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.150 
basically
get<00:04:38.630> rid<00:04:38.780> of<00:04:38.810> that<00:04:38.930> momentum<00:04:39.140> involves<00:04:39.950> an

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
get rid of that momentum involves an

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.520 
get rid of that momentum involves an
impulse<00:04:40.610> which<00:04:40.880> involves<00:04:41.300> a<00:04:41.390> pressure<00:04:41.660> and<00:04:41.990> so

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 
impulse which involves a pressure and so

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.020 
impulse which involves a pressure and so
this<00:04:42.680> is<00:04:42.800> why<00:04:43.010> when<00:04:43.310> you<00:04:43.430> close<00:04:43.670> the<00:04:43.820> valve

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
this is why when you close the valve

old house you can hear the pipes as a
whole<00:04:48.560> just<00:04:48.590> you<00:04:49.100> know<00:04:49.220> basically<00:04:49.780> shutter<00:04:50.780> in

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
it's the pressure causes interactions

it's the pressure causes interactions
with<00:04:55.610> the<00:04:55.730> pipes<00:04:55.940> as<00:04:56.150> well<00:04:56.360> and<00:04:56.990> that's<00:04:57.140> what
