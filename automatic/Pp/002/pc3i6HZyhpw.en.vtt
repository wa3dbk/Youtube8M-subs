00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.930
 first let's go to the products that I'm going to use explained Alonso 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.369
 with this project is the famous list this year so the three who are p 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.900
 ankara makeup and is basically expected to help 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.789
 to prepare where it goes through me 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:24.800
 Cuba 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.869
 Chancellor rented the chancellor 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.289
 another part we are going to use is very important is a brush 

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:32.659
 why 

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:37.100
 and this to get them and ways especially 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.749
 to pons to the foreign ministers that we are going to use toral 

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:45.439
 another of the products that I personally personally 

00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:46.949
 are these two concerts 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:49.280
 and that is that of lamentin three months 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.630
 oquelí this is a world 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.110
 my friend from him 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.270
 and now my favorites 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.410
 east of mexico 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.030
 or what's left in the whole box 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.220
 heselden demands that's how it looks 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.720
 now that he 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.260
 the pianist and the noses a bit more greasy than succeed 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.170
 but combined really a wonderful job and I love it 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.070
 art another very important step is to say that ariza 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.010
 this prebase with chaos and the little Pashtun favorite powder company you do not have 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.310
 to use 1 Jan one in particular 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.950
 with this is all you occupy 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.980
 so let's see let's start 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.390
 I'm the first one you're going to do and discuss issues you're hitting sometimes 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.539
 asked the camera 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:38.399
 but the first thing you're going to do this way once extracted and we're going to 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:39.500
 clean 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.220
 the part of the eye where are we going to apply 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.800
 all our fellow citizens 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.800
 to hide the dark circles 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.500
 so avoid 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.500
 I do not have many colleges 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.570
 I'm going out and I want to seal 

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:11.559
 my base under the eyes at the end of the time 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.689
 my eye theory so that's why I want to show you how you can 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:21.650
 has as you can cover the circles but good we will use the product 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.289
 it was reagan 

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:24.829
 and that change can be 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:27.689
 find in any pharmacy you decided 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:30.689
 and with a little bit we play a lot 

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:35.949
 let's apply this under the eye 

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:39.240
 and that to work is a test does for makeup 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.059
 but I love using the also below 

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:45.499
 of the eyes because it will help me so that the chancellor 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:50.049
 I did not have enough 

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:54.509
 And that's very good 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:03.269
 now you would be in the eyes is a bit delicate and they have to treat it with 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:08.109
 very delicate but good since we put teacher dare to do what 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:10.319
 let's do is let's grab the prose 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.749
 to apply the chancellor and the first one that I like to sting is endemic and this 

00:03:14.749 --> 00:03:15.350
 from Mexico 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.350
 they're not married so I'm going to support you with taking advantage 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:23.959
 and I have a technique person what I do is that powel the chancellor 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:27.289
 like an angel 

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:29.649
 I think I've met the other side 

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:32.649
 we have only started to pinamar what you apply 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:36.709
 in this way 

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:41.039
 with little ones as well as small blows 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:44.059
 you apply 

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:47.059
 and lower it as in a law 

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:48.859
 and this will help you 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:51.859
 to clarify this part of the face much more 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.509
 it works like very dangerous very pretty 

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:58.509
 now the other side 

00:04:05.499 --> 00:04:07.629
 mcgee 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:10.629
 context of success 

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:16.009
 now does not apply for pools 

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:20.729
 from ahmed hundredth time now she herself and cashmere access a little more fatty 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:23.800
 but in reality it is also a 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.289
 I'm leaving very good 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:27.059
 so 

00:04:27.059 --> 00:04:30.059
 we are going to apply only a little bit 

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:34.659
 jiménez and telephone but no longer apply this part 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.539
 again the brush 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:42.539
 and we are going to put here 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.819
 do not worry 

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:51.909
 of putting the two colors together at this time, nothing bad is applying 

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:02.189
 now this is where it has to happen for that purpose to have a lot 

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:03.980
 patience with him in his hand 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.980
 with the finger where we put our wedding ring 

00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:10.809
 I bring you this news home 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:15.449
 we go 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.139
 put the colors together 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:22.069
 and with little taps come 

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:24.259
 we will investigate 

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:27.889
 the chancellors and we will raise it to the eye until this part 

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:32.319
 mounting 

00:05:36.059 --> 00:05:39.619
 they fall as they fear in one grabs a wipe again that we use to 

00:05:39.619 --> 00:05:41.999
 beginning cleaning the finger 

00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:44.999
 and we continue with the other 

00:05:57.559 --> 00:05:59.900
 to finish the look and 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.520
 Check that everything is fine what we are going to do is that we are going to win the dust 

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:07.749
 and with a clean brush 

00:06:07.749 --> 00:06:12.189
 We are going to press for the dust and gas that you are already here, the future of 

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:13.139
 batman 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:16.139
 with a crop of anything that is 1 68 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.400
 I will pass the rocha very slowly 

00:06:22.369 --> 00:06:25.369
 in the part of the eye 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:31.699
 what I like about this is that when you start the two chancellors one of a 

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:34.169
 base a little more greasy than the other 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:39.250
 the other one is a little closer is that it gives us like to balance the consistency 

00:06:39.249 --> 00:06:41.229
 inostroza 

00:06:41.229 --> 00:06:44.419
 a result much more beautiful and that will not happen 

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:46.289
 seasoned 

00:06:46.289 --> 00:06:49.590
 lines that meet at the bottom 

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:51.839
 and none of that 

00:06:51.839 --> 00:06:53.629
 It gives you nothing like 

00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:55.529
 the results more 

00:06:55.529 --> 00:06:58.529
 let's say it like that 

00:07:00.719 --> 00:07:05.069
 and that's all this is how we go to the culés is our sowers 

00:07:05.069 --> 00:07:08.989
 I know it's not very difficult here the trick is to have patience 

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:12.940
 apply everything remember that we have to apply it in a 

00:07:13.569 --> 00:07:17.520
 as in an equine network that are sets that clarifies would be so good 

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:22.530
 and it would not be that the condom or that light as regards light as well as the low 

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:25.819
 of the eye so that it will not be so dark circles 

00:07:25.819 --> 00:07:30.900
 i that ad better the eyes even more and more prettier cool but good 

00:07:30.899 --> 00:07:32.699
