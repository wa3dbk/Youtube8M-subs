00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
that opened up today and then also had

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.570 
that opened up today and then also had
that<00:02:44.130> really<00:02:44.490> crappy<00:02:45.209> 500k<00:02:46.490> present<00:02:47.490> or<00:02:47.550> not

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
that really crappy 500k present or not

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.110 
that really crappy 500k present or not
500k<00:02:48.420> 500<00:02:49.140> coin<00:02:49.410> present<00:02:50.040> so<00:02:50.220> that<00:02:50.940> was<00:02:51.090> a

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
500k 500 coin present so that was a

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.520 
500k 500 coin present so that was a
little<00:02:51.450> depressing<00:02:51.870> but<00:02:52.050> i<00:02:52.200> think<00:02:52.410> i<00:02:52.500> have

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
little depressing but i think i have

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.690 
little depressing but i think i have
like<00:02:52.770> four<00:02:53.070> or<00:02:53.220> five<00:02:53.250> more<00:02:55.520> presence<00:02:56.520> and

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
like four or five more presence and

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.460 
like four or five more presence and
there's<00:02:56.850> one<00:02:57.060> I<00:02:57.090> get<00:02:57.360> here<00:02:57.750> but<00:02:58.080> I<00:02:58.110> already

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
there's one I get here but I already

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.300 
there's one I get here but I already
have<00:02:58.590> this<00:02:58.770> one<00:02:59.250> and<00:02:59.580> if<00:03:00.240> you<00:03:00.360> look<00:03:00.600> above<00:03:00.840> the

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
have this one and if you look above the

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.640 
have this one and if you look above the
the<00:03:02.310> moose<00:03:02.580> on<00:03:02.970> the<00:03:03.030> kind<00:03:03.810> of<00:03:03.959> square<00:03:04.290> shaped

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
the moose on the kind of square shaped

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.640 
the moose on the kind of square shaped
box<00:03:05.090> it<00:03:06.090> looks<00:03:06.300> like<00:03:06.390> it's<00:03:06.630> a<00:03:06.720> contract<00:03:07.290> symbol

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
box it looks like it's a contract symbol

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:08.930 
box it looks like it's a contract symbol
so<00:03:07.800> this<00:03:07.950> is<00:03:08.070> more<00:03:08.250> than<00:03:08.370> likely<00:03:08.550> going<00:03:08.820> to<00:03:08.880> be

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
so this is more than likely going to be

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.840 
so this is more than likely going to be
contracts<00:03:09.630> so<00:03:10.590> I'm<00:03:10.740> not<00:03:10.890> too<00:03:10.950> excited<00:03:11.220> if<00:03:11.730> I

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
contracts so I'm not too excited if I

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.890 
contracts so I'm not too excited if I
just<00:03:12.150> got<00:03:12.330> something<00:03:12.810> for<00:03:12.959> 500<00:03:13.590> coins<00:03:14.600> okay<00:03:15.600> so

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
just got something for 500 coins okay so

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.900 
just got something for 500 coins okay so
there<00:03:16.050> we<00:03:16.080> go<00:03:16.230> this<00:03:16.590> one<00:03:16.800> this<00:03:17.640> one's

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
there we go this one this one's

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.970 
there we go this one this one's
different<00:03:18.300> but<00:03:18.780> then<00:03:18.930> again<00:03:19.050> I<00:03:19.260> look<00:03:19.590> at<00:03:19.800> it

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
different but then again I look at it

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.440 
different but then again I look at it
closely<00:03:20.220> and<00:03:20.640> it<00:03:20.820> looks<00:03:21.000> like<00:03:21.180> it<00:03:21.300> has<00:03:21.420> a

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
closely and it looks like it has a

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.979 
closely and it looks like it has a
contract<00:03:22.080> symbol<00:03:22.530> on<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:22.800> bow<00:03:23.010> as<00:03:23.220> well<00:03:23.430> so

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
contract symbol on the bow as well so

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:26.390 
contract symbol on the bow as well so
not<00:03:24.989> looking<00:03:25.350> good<00:03:25.470> for<00:03:25.530> me<00:03:25.860> man<00:03:26.070> I'm<00:03:26.220> getting

not looking good for me man I'm getting
presents<00:03:26.940> but<00:03:27.180> but<00:03:27.450> I'm<00:03:27.570> not<00:03:27.750> excited<00:03:28.050> about

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
presents but but I'm not excited about

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.540 
presents but but I'm not excited about
what's<00:03:28.620> going<00:03:28.739> to<00:03:28.830> be<00:03:28.950> in<00:03:28.980> them<00:03:29.220> because<00:03:29.340> if

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
what's going to be in them because if

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.680 
what's going to be in them because if
they<00:03:29.670> gave<00:03:29.880> me<00:03:30.030> a<00:03:30.060> 500<00:03:30.810> coin<00:03:31.680> present<00:03:32.280> I<00:03:32.459> I<00:03:33.120> can

they gave me a 500 coin present I I can
only<00:03:33.840> imagine<00:03:34.019> that<00:03:34.470> these<00:03:34.739> contract

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
only imagine that these contract

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.680 
only imagine that these contract
presents<00:03:35.790> are<00:03:35.850> going<00:03:35.970> to<00:03:36.030> be<00:03:36.150> like<00:03:36.330> 10

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.250 
get I'm not sure it looks like there's a

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:17.029 
get I'm not sure it looks like there's a
bee<00:06:14.610> on<00:06:14.639> the<00:06:14.970> upper<00:06:15.300> left<00:06:15.539> corner<00:06:15.900> of<00:06:16.080> this<00:06:16.650> so

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:17.039 
bee on the upper left corner of this so

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:19.370 
bee on the upper left corner of this so
it's<00:06:17.789> more<00:06:18.180> than<00:06:18.330> likely<00:06:18.389> going<00:06:18.990> to<00:06:19.110> be<00:06:19.229> a

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:19.380 
it's more than likely going to be a

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.920 
it's more than likely going to be a
badge<00:06:19.770> but<00:06:20.310> what<00:06:20.490> type<00:06:20.669> of<00:06:20.700> badge<00:06:21.060> is<00:06:21.330> it<00:06:21.690> I

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:21.930 
badge but what type of badge is it I

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.409 
badge but what type of badge is it I
that<00:06:22.800> wrapping<00:06:23.250> paper<00:06:23.460> kind<00:06:23.760> of<00:06:23.880> looks<00:06:24.030> gold

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:24.419 
that wrapping paper kind of looks gold

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:27.740 
that wrapping paper kind of looks gold
to<00:06:24.690> me<00:06:24.840> so<00:06:25.080> maybe<00:06:25.229> a<00:06:25.410> gold<00:06:25.830> badge<00:06:26.100> I<00:06:26.460> guess<00:06:26.750> not

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:27.750 
to me so maybe a gold badge I guess not

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:29.120 
to me so maybe a gold badge I guess not
really<00:06:28.080> worth<00:06:28.229> it<00:06:28.440> when<00:06:28.560> you<00:06:28.650> think<00:06:28.860> about<00:06:28.950> it

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:29.130 
really worth it when you think about it

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:31.640 
really worth it when you think about it
because<00:06:29.430> I<00:06:29.520> could<00:06:29.700> have<00:06:29.789> sold<00:06:29.940> all<00:06:30.870> of<00:06:30.930> the<00:06:31.500> all

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:31.650 
because I could have sold all of the all

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:33.770 
because I could have sold all of the all
five<00:06:31.950> of<00:06:31.979> those<00:06:32.250> and<00:06:32.580> got<00:06:32.700> five<00:06:32.940> badges<00:06:33.240> from

five of those and got five badges from

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:35.810 
five of those and got five badges from
the<00:06:33.990> profits<00:06:34.440> that<00:06:34.530> I<00:06:34.650> made<00:06:34.830> on<00:06:35.010> them<00:06:35.159> but<00:06:35.370> i'll

white portion of the stocking so I'm
going<00:07:22.259> to<00:07:22.289> guess<00:07:22.560> this<00:07:22.800> is<00:07:22.979> coins<00:07:23.250> because<00:07:23.669> it

00:07:23.959 --> 00:07:23.969 
going to guess this is coins because it

00:07:23.969 --> 00:07:26.629 
going to guess this is coins because it
kind<00:07:24.150> of<00:07:24.210> has<00:07:24.360> that<00:07:24.389> coin<00:07:24.870> symbol<00:07:25.379> but<00:07:25.710> again
