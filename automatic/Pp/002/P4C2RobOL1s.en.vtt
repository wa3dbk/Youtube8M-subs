00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 it's not all the time they win 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.470
 are a dozen that morning trying to 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.750
 their luck tourists passing through or 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.790
 Vendee on vacation all have only one 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.620
 only idea in mind out a maximum 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.170
 crayfish I think we are not 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.640
 patient enough so here we have to be 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.730
 able I think to wait ten minutes 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.529
 a quarter of an hour but the virus makes 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.890
 we want to meet both 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.050
 minutes 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.820
 and if they were shy in the 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.320
 first half hour it did not last 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.939
 it must be said that crayfish 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.590
 present in these channels are 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.360
 classified as exotic species 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.010
 invasive 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.750
 arrived in France fifteen years ago they 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.250
 have been proliferating ever since 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.110
 today we find them on 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.100
 the whole marsh poitevin is a 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.420
 fishing that they developed everything 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.160
 simply because now we are 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.100
 invaded by a species of crayfish that 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.239
 is called the louisiana crayfish that has 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.559
 been introduced involuntarily 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.300
 probably through 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.360
 farms that are developed in the 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.590
 France is so this species is suitable 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.230
 to circles here you agree 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.699
 perfectly in my eyes not oxygenate 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.030
 harm of water meant for both easy to 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.379
 so dig a very mild climate so 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.900
 populations would have exploded since 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:11.700
 a few years and we have a lot of good 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.530
 a lot a lot of fake and here we 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.360
 sinners have opted for the technique of 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.369
 the balance and as for the baits 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.200
 these are croquettes for cats the 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.299
 crayfish are waiting for you and the 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.880
 satisfied fishermen apprentices I offered 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.909
 it's my little girls to see what 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.340
 it was a pretty funny technique 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.460
 for the kids the scales and then 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.460
 also 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.600
 for ecological respect I believe 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.350
 that good practices must be taken 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.480
 from the start according to the law every take 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.220
 must be killed before being transported 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.760
 and in terms of how to 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.710
 to cook 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:49.570
 to each his method there is no 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:52.430
 particular recipe it is plancha and 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.560
 flambÃ© this fishing is practiced from 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.930
 spring at the end of the summer without any 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.460
 quantity limit is size but 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.880
 attention the fishing card remain 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.880
 mandatory
