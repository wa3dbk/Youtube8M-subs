00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.859
 especially beginners often ask me 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.970
 after the perfect training plan 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:19.890
 and if I create a plan 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.869
 and then really a whole body 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.519
 plan is wonder why simon 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.900
 give me a ganzkÃ¶rperplastinat after all 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.789
 completely different you are training completely 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.890
 otherwise you train only a few 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.150
 Muscle groups on a day why should 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.439
 I plan now after full body 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.890
 why should a workout now? 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.090
 beginner a full-body training plan 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.590
 pay attention and someone else 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.500
 Perhaps the most advanced is 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.120
 split or split muscle groups 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.590
 for speed training how to do that hardly 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.090
 another video of the beginner 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:51.210
 just does not train so intensely 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.800
 that means it simply recognizes it 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.170
 not to train to the limits 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.800
 until the muscle failure 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.050
 accordingly has a significant 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.760
 shorter regeneration time that is the 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.989
 muscle does not take that long until he does 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.300
 it's not busy yet 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.580
 trainable and you can do that 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.930
 whole body more often so each 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.600
 Muscle group more often in the week 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.520
 train and do rehearsals pro 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.729
 training unit makes it all 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.500
 smaller success but this more often 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:18.689
 that means a full body plan super 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.380
 suitable for beginners because you just 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.549
 more quickly 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.350
 many small successes makes a good one 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:28.170
 Full body training plan should be like that 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.579
 be built that he exercises so far 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.409
 that they merge into each other 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.750
 that is compound exercise more 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.799
 articulate exercise on the other exercise 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.570
 are tuned again 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.310
 That's why you want to breast, for example 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.869
 does when you do bench press or 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.280
 press diagonally Bank has a bit 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.590
 from the shoulder already in it 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.000
 then shoulder press on shoulder 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.210
 again presses the triceps already with in it 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.180
 and so on that means you have effectively 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.530
 more exercise per muscle group though 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.909
 only one of these can be trained 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.610
 really the whole body very well 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.049
 train and you will see 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.540
 a certain time makes you very good 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.760
 progress especially as a beginner and 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.740
 if you do that for a few weeks 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.090
 has pulled through months and you notice 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.590
 can now train more and more intense 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.940
 the regeneration time is longer the 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.830
 Muscular pain is still there although you already 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.530
 I would like to train again 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.880
 really advise splitting now 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.130
 maybe the advanced ones 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.050
 do not think that a whole body plan only 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.280
 Beginner is now and then when you go 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.840
 again such a plateau reached if one 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.200
 gets stuck if you have something new 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.640
 I also need training after 15 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.680
 years after a full body plan 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.020
 does not quite as long as he does 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.190
 then about four to six weeks about that 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.750
 I really have a nice hard one 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.720
 intensive full-body training plan 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.760
 pull through and then you come back like that 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.640
 a little bit in such a new training stimulus 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.610
 I can highly recommend you 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.140
 and just try it on and on 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.910
 definitely start with one 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.450
 Full body training plan on and her 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.450
 make the following 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:12.440
 for you today one of the really 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:15.319
 main topics for the sport for the 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:19.390
 explain power sports for muscle building 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:19.390
 namely the topic of intensity
