00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 Hello dear friends with you I yuri 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.720
 axenov and today I want to tell you 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.639
 a microcosm of the game survayval of souls 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.570
 the game is a strategy in 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.429
 real time 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.980
 the main main goal of which is to become 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.450
 dominant microorganisms stylistics 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.580
 the main idea of ​​the game is very strong 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.470
 reminds legendary osmosis 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.359
 but, no less, the game mechanics have 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.189
 significant difference but about all 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.500
 order let's start with the graph here at 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.750
 In principle, there is nothing to complain about. 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.550
 high quality and stylish 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.619
 the cells themselves and what they produce 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.020
 antibodies have pleasant neon 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.510
 glow besides graphics atmospheric 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.129
 the game adds sound 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.110
 she literally fascinates and makes 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.110
 believe that you are inside 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.300
 of some organism you play for the cage 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.579
 which constantly produces antibodies 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.800
 using antibodies you can capture 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.230
 other cells and thereby eliminate 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.730
 hostile microorganisms choosing a cell 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.070
 you can push in any area 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.379
 the screen and your cell will slowly begin 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.420
 move to the intended point in order to 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.520
 choose antibodies need to commit 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.979
 roundabout in near area in 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.630
 which they are after their selection 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.790
 you can give them an order either 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.530
 to attack other cells either 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.840
 use them to upgrade your 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.150
 cells for this you need to make a double 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.280
 tap on it the bigger your cell is 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.229
 harder and grab and the more she 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.750
 produces antibodies per unit of time 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.970
 there is no definite tactic here 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.380
 always have to look at the circumstances 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.810
 and then you will be no problem 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.729
 handle all the missions for the moment 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.920
 There are seventy-two reviews in the game. 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.909
 levels about 30 of them are available 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.829
 is free 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.590
 the rest can be obtained by committing 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.720
 in-game purchase of 75 rubles 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.729
 in the google play comments developer 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.680
 wrote that promises in the near future 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.450
 add new levels as well 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.409
 planned to add to this game 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.540
 multiplayer 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.640
 If multiplayer in this game appears then 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.409
 it will be in my opinion a bomb 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.600
 because compete with real 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.909
 people are always more interesting and at the same time 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.310
 always finale unpredictable after 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.320
 installing the game I stuck it around on 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.659
 an hour and stopped just because 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.700
 that it was necessary to leave in my opinion 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.140
 the game is enough replay time 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.390
 you start experimenting with 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.489
 strategy and tactics and honing your 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.210
 fighting style you can go back to the beginning and 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.040
 pass the first mission already 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.230
 as an expert quality to strategy on 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.360
 android is not so much the more such 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.700
 which possess both beautiful graphics and 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.010
 pleasant soundtrack and addictive 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.410
 gameplay in general if you like strategy 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.140
 then the game is a microcosm of survive sells 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.550
 I definitely recommend to read 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.620
