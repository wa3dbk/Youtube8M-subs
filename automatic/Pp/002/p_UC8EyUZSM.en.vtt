00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.110 

top<00:00:07.590> you<00:00:07.740> tube<00:00:07.770> sloppy<00:00:08.730> wet<00:00:08.970> below<00:00:09.180> here<00:00:09.770> I

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:11.120 
top you tube sloppy wet below here I

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.420 
top you tube sloppy wet below here I
think<00:00:12.120> it<00:00:12.210> would<00:00:12.330> give<00:00:12.450> a<00:00:12.480> good<00:00:13.040> comparison

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:15.430 
think it would give a good comparison

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:20.520 
think it would give a good comparison
60<00:00:16.000> x<00:00:16.150> 1600<00:00:17.430> benchmark<00:00:18.430> verse<00:00:19.230> 1920<00:00:20.230> x<00:00:20.350> 1080

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:20.530 
60 x 1600 benchmark verse 1920 x 1080

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:23.760 
60 x 1600 benchmark verse 1920 x 1080
which<00:00:21.010> is<00:00:21.190> a<00:00:21.690> the<00:00:22.690> regular<00:00:23.110> high<00:00:23.230> definition

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:23.770 
which is a the regular high definition

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.120 
which is a the regular high definition
that<00:00:23.860> we<00:00:23.920> all<00:00:24.190> pretty<00:00:24.490> much<00:00:24.610> use<00:00:25.230> on<00:00:26.230> our<00:00:26.290> tvs

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.130 
that we all pretty much use on our tvs

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.420 
that we all pretty much use on our tvs
and<00:00:27.490> monitors<00:00:27.520> and<00:00:28.150> that's<00:00:28.270> the<00:00:28.450> most<00:00:28.570> famous

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:29.430 
and monitors and that's the most famous

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.650 
and monitors and that's the most famous
resolution<00:00:30.430> so<00:00:31.029> I<00:00:31.060> figured<00:00:31.119> we'd<00:00:31.450> run<00:00:31.630> a

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:31.660 
resolution so I figured we'd run a

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.369 
resolution so I figured we'd run a
comparison<00:00:32.169> I'll<00:00:32.710> run<00:00:33.580> them<00:00:34.260> you<00:00:35.260> know

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:35.379 
comparison I'll run them you know

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:37.890 
comparison I'll run them you know
back-to-back<00:00:36.220> i'll<00:00:36.520> start<00:00:36.820> with<00:00:36.910> the<00:00:36.970> 1920<00:00:37.780> x

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:37.900 
back-to-back i'll start with the 1920 x

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.840 
back-to-back i'll start with the 1920 x
1080<00:00:38.140> and<00:00:38.650> then<00:00:39.400> we'll<00:00:39.580> do<00:00:39.760> a<00:00:40.059> 2560<00:00:40.930> by<00:00:41.050> 1600

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
1080 and then we'll do a 2560 by 1600

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.530 
1080 and then we'll do a 2560 by 1600
comparison<00:00:42.850> um<00:00:43.739> this<00:00:44.739> is<00:00:44.920> metro<00:00:45.220> 2033<00:00:45.820> it's<00:00:46.449> a

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:46.540 
comparison um this is metro 2033 it's a

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.850 
comparison um this is metro 2033 it's a
benchmark<00:00:47.700> it's<00:00:48.700> pretty<00:00:48.970> cool<00:00:49.180> I<00:00:49.680> just<00:00:50.680> tested

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.860 
benchmark it's pretty cool I just tested

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.850 
benchmark it's pretty cool I just tested
it<00:00:51.130> out<00:00:51.310> and<00:00:52.239> it<00:00:52.480> really<00:00:53.230> is<00:00:53.440> pretty<00:00:53.590> cool

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860 
it out and it really is pretty cool

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.319 
it out and it really is pretty cool
benchmark<00:00:54.399> and<00:00:54.579> kind<00:00:54.790> of<00:00:54.880> shows<00:00:55.030> you<00:00:55.180> where

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:55.329 
benchmark and kind of shows you where

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:58.049 
benchmark and kind of shows you where
your<00:00:55.480> GPU<00:00:55.989> is<00:00:56.140> and<00:00:56.710> what<00:00:57.430> it<00:00:57.520> can<00:00:57.610> do<00:00:57.790> on<00:00:58.030> a

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059 
your GPU is and what it can do on a

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:01.380 
your GPU is and what it can do on a
pretty<00:00:58.510> pretty<00:00:59.260> much<00:01:00.160> intensive<00:01:00.820> game<00:01:01.000> you're

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
pretty pretty much intensive game you're

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.510 
pretty pretty much intensive game you're
not<00:01:01.480> gonna<00:01:01.570> get<00:01:01.690> more<00:01:01.870> intense<00:01:02.110> I<00:01:02.500> still<00:01:03.309> think

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:03.520 
not gonna get more intense I still think

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.490 
not gonna get more intense I still think
besides<00:01:03.670> Batman<00:01:04.239> I<00:01:04.420> think<00:01:04.869> Batman<00:01:05.229> is<00:01:05.320> pretty

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
besides Batman I think Batman is pretty

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.100 
besides Batman I think Batman is pretty
crazy<00:01:05.680> but<00:01:06.280> anyway<00:01:06.490> let's<00:01:06.670> get<00:01:06.820> to<00:01:07.060> it<00:01:07.110> first

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
crazy but anyway let's get to it first

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.930 
crazy but anyway let's get to it first
thing<00:01:08.229> I<00:01:08.320> want<00:01:08.470> to<00:01:08.500> let<00:01:08.619> you<00:01:08.680> guys<00:01:08.890> know<00:01:09.190> is<00:01:09.580> in

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:09.940 
thing I want to let you guys know is in

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.389 
thing I want to let you guys know is in
order<00:01:10.630> to<00:01:10.869> get<00:01:11.110> this<00:01:11.290> benchmark<00:01:11.890> you<00:01:12.160> already

00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:12.399 
order to get this benchmark you already

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:14.430 
order to get this benchmark you already
have<00:01:12.580> it<00:01:12.790> if<00:01:13.119> you<00:01:13.210> own<00:01:13.420> this<00:01:13.630> game<00:01:13.840> you<00:01:14.050> got<00:01:14.259> it

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
have it if you own this game you got it

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.900 
have it if you own this game you got it
already<00:01:14.590> you<00:01:14.860> don't<00:01:14.950> even<00:01:15.100> realize<00:01:15.369> it<00:01:15.610> but

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:15.910 
already you don't even realize it but

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.200 
already you don't even realize it but
it's<00:01:16.090> actually<00:01:16.240> in<00:01:16.600> your<00:01:16.780> any<00:01:17.020> files<00:01:18.210> hiding

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
it's actually in your any files hiding

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.420 
it's actually in your any files hiding
away<00:01:19.330> and<00:01:19.810> it's<00:01:20.020> very<00:01:20.500> easy<00:01:20.710> to<00:01:20.950> get<00:01:21.070> to<00:01:21.280> I'm

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
away and it's very easy to get to I'm

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.120 
away and it's very easy to get to I'm
going<00:01:21.520> to<00:01:21.580> tell<00:01:21.820> you<00:01:21.850> now<00:01:21.970> how<00:01:22.540> to<00:01:22.890> get<00:01:23.890> to<00:01:24.040> this

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
going to tell you now how to get to this

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.410 
going to tell you now how to get to this
bench<00:01:24.369> block<00:01:24.549> that's<00:01:24.790> already<00:01:25.060> in<00:01:25.180> your

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
bench block that's already in your

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.020 
bench block that's already in your
system<00:01:25.780> so<00:01:26.020> what<00:01:26.290> you're<00:01:26.409> going<00:01:26.500> to<00:01:26.560> do<00:01:26.710> is

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
system so what you're going to do is

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.950 
system so what you're going to do is
again<00:01:28.030> this<00:01:28.180> is<00:01:28.360> for<00:01:28.570> a<00:01:28.600> windows<00:01:29.110> 7<00:01:29.470> 64<00:01:30.280> bit<00:01:30.960> I'm

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
again this is for a windows 7 64 bit I'm

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.899 
again this is for a windows 7 64 bit I'm
sure<00:01:32.229> it's<00:01:32.380> pretty<00:01:32.590> much<00:01:32.680> similar<00:01:33.010> if<00:01:33.490> you<00:01:33.760> go

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909 
sure it's pretty much similar if you go

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:36.330 
sure it's pretty much similar if you go
to<00:01:33.970> other<00:01:34.240> type<00:01:34.510> of<00:01:34.540> style<00:01:34.810> windows<00:01:35.260> but<00:01:36.130> I'm

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
to other type of style windows but I'm

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.590 
to other type of style windows but I'm
going<00:01:36.549> to<00:01:36.610> tell<00:01:36.850> you<00:01:36.909> because<00:01:37.150> that's<00:01:37.360> what<00:01:37.540> I

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
going to tell you because that's what I

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.039 
going to tell you because that's what I
do<00:01:37.659> have<00:01:37.960> is<00:01:38.020> windows<00:01:38.619> 7<00:01:39.040> 64<00:01:39.670> bit<00:01:39.900> alright<00:01:40.900> so

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:41.049 
do have is windows 7 64 bit alright so

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:43.429 
do have is windows 7 64 bit alright so
you're<00:01:41.140> going<00:01:41.260> to<00:01:41.320> go<00:01:41.439> into<00:01:41.619> you<00:01:42.610> can<00:01:42.729> open<00:01:43.000> up

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
opened up all right so let's start it

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.190 
opened up all right so let's start it
we're<00:02:40.550> going<00:02:40.640> to<00:02:40.700> do<00:02:40.880> everything<00:02:41.540> is<00:02:41.930> just<00:02:42.110> to

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
we're going to do everything is just to

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.900 
we're going to do everything is just to
let<00:02:42.290> you<00:02:42.410> know<00:02:42.530> you<00:02:42.560> could<00:02:42.860> do<00:02:42.980> directx<00:02:43.610> 10

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
let you know you could do directx 10

let you know you could do directx 10
directx<00:02:43.970> 9<00:02:45.610> obviously<00:02:46.610> do<00:02:46.790> a<00:02:47.030> direct<00:02:47.209> x<00:02:47.540> 11<00:02:47.870> if

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
directx 9 obviously do a direct x 11 if

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.870 
directx 9 obviously do a direct x 11 if
you<00:02:47.990> can<00:02:48.140> do<00:02:48.260> it<00:02:48.410> it's<00:02:48.530> more<00:02:48.709> fun<00:02:48.920> 1920<00:02:49.610> x<00:02:49.700> 1080

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
you can do it it's more fun 1920 x 1080

you ok texture filtering is 16 times

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.240 
you ok texture filtering is 16 times
which<00:03:00.320> is<00:03:00.440> the<00:03:00.560> highest<00:03:00.709> we're<00:03:01.010> going<00:03:01.130> to<00:03:01.190> do

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
which is the highest we're going to do

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.060 
which is the highest we're going to do
enable<00:03:01.540> advanced<00:03:02.540> physics<00:03:03.019> and<00:03:03.290> depth<00:03:03.890> of

field tessellations on and the scene is
Frontline<00:03:07.100> ok<00:03:07.730> and<00:03:07.850> this<00:03:07.970> is<00:03:08.120> the<00:03:08.239> amount<00:03:08.330> of

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
Frontline ok and this is the amount of

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.350 
Frontline ok and this is the amount of
passes<00:03:08.959> that<00:03:09.800> means<00:03:10.010> it'll<00:03:10.550> to<00:03:10.790> run<00:03:10.970> three

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
passes that means it'll to run three

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.400 
passes that means it'll to run three
times<00:03:11.630> ok<00:03:12.410> just<00:03:12.739> to<00:03:12.860> let<00:03:13.040> you<00:03:13.130> know<00:03:14.410> we're

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
times ok just to let you know we're

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.160 
times ok just to let you know we're
going<00:03:15.500> to<00:03:15.590> run<00:03:15.680> it<00:03:15.830> two<00:03:15.950> times<00:03:16.900> alright<00:03:17.900> so<00:03:18.050> it

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
going to run it two times alright so it

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.420 
going to run it two times alright so it
otherwise<00:03:18.410> it'll<00:03:18.650> take<00:03:18.830> you<00:03:19.070> know<00:03:19.160> it<00:03:19.280> doesn't

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
otherwise it'll take you know it doesn't

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.820 
otherwise it'll take you know it doesn't
take<00:03:19.550> that<00:03:19.760> long<00:03:19.820> so<00:03:20.269> let's<00:03:20.900> run<00:03:21.140> it<00:03:21.170> two<00:03:21.620> times

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
take that long so let's run it two times

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.830 
take that long so let's run it two times
on<00:03:22.220> each<00:03:22.730> one<00:03:23.090> so<00:03:23.239> we're<00:03:23.360> going<00:03:23.450> to<00:03:23.540> start<00:03:23.570> with

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
on each one so we're going to start with

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.509 
on each one so we're going to start with
1920<00:03:24.820> x<00:03:25.820> 1080<00:03:26.269> alright<00:03:27.140> guys<00:03:27.320> so<00:03:27.650> when<00:03:28.190> you<00:03:28.280> do

is going to pop open all right and from

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.710 
is going to pop open all right and from
there<00:03:33.230> you're<00:03:34.190> going<00:03:34.220> to<00:03:34.400> start<00:03:35.060> up<00:03:35.239> this<00:03:35.420> app

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
there you're going to start up this app

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:53.370 
there you're going to start up this app
and<00:03:36.579> it'll<00:03:37.579> benchmark<00:03:38.060> your<00:03:38.239> GPS<00:03:39.430> here<00:03:40.430> we<00:03:40.519> go

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.060 

so<00:03:54.450> what<00:03:55.450> it<00:03:55.570> is<00:03:55.690> just<00:03:56.080> a<00:03:56.140> scene<00:03:56.380> with<00:03:56.620> a<00:03:56.650> lot<00:03:56.920> of

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
so what it is just a scene with a lot of

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.450 
so what it is just a scene with a lot of
action<00:03:57.430> going<00:03:57.460> on<00:03:57.820> obviously<00:03:58.450> a<00:03:58.480> lot<00:03:59.460> of

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:00.460 
action going on obviously a lot of

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.730 
action going on obviously a lot of
shooting<00:04:00.850> your<00:04:01.330> particle<00:04:01.870> effects<00:04:02.200> they<00:04:02.560> got

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:02.740 
shooting your particle effects they got

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.120 
shooting your particle effects they got
you<00:04:03.520> know<00:04:03.840> smoke<00:04:04.840> and<00:04:05.230> everything<00:04:05.590> going<00:04:06.040> on

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
you know smoke and everything going on

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.020 
you know smoke and everything going on
just<00:04:06.340> the<00:04:06.610> test<00:04:06.850> your<00:04:07.090> GPUs<00:04:08.580> you<00:04:09.580> see<00:04:09.820> things

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
just the test your GPUs you see things

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.640 
just the test your GPUs you see things
exploding<00:04:11.130> pretty<00:04:12.130> cool<00:04:13.170> so<00:04:14.170> we'll<00:04:14.380> see<00:04:14.530> what

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
exploding pretty cool so we'll see what

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:25.710 
exploding pretty cool so we'll see what
this<00:04:14.770> could<00:04:14.950> do

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.530 

a<00:04:25.780> lot<00:04:26.350> of<00:04:26.380> bullets<00:04:26.800> you<00:04:26.950> can<00:04:27.100> see<00:04:27.220> all<00:04:27.250> of

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
a lot of bullets you can see all of

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.200 
a lot of bullets you can see all of
everything<00:04:28.540> going<00:04:28.690> on<00:04:28.870> here<00:04:29.850> the<00:04:30.850> end<00:04:31.000> it's

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
everything going on here the end it's

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.370 
everything going on here the end it's
less<00:04:31.930> intense<00:04:32.830> on<00:04:33.100> the<00:04:33.250> GPU<00:04:34.080> but<00:04:35.080> again<00:04:35.260> so

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
less intense on the GPU but again so

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.860 
less intense on the GPU but again so
you're<00:04:35.500> getting<00:04:35.710> some<00:04:36.180> fog<00:04:37.180> and<00:04:37.480> stuff<00:04:37.690> like

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
you're getting some fog and stuff like

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:45.240 
you're getting some fog and stuff like
that<00:04:37.930> and<00:04:38.140> smoke<00:04:43.650> so<00:04:44.650> it's<00:04:44.770> going<00:04:44.890> to<00:04:44.980> run<00:04:45.130> it

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
that and smoke so it's going to run it

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:53.990 
that and smoke so it's going to run it
again<00:04:47.040> he<00:04:48.040> goes<00:04:48.190> past<00:04:48.490> two

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.970 

so<00:04:54.600> you<00:04:54.690> see<00:04:55.020> the<00:04:55.140> top<00:04:55.320> left<00:04:55.530> you<00:04:55.590> got<00:04:55.710> frames

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:55.980 
so you see the top left you got frames

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.860 
so you see the top left you got frames
per<00:04:56.160> second<00:04:56.580> at<00:04:56.730> the<00:04:56.850> exact<00:04:57.330> second<00:04:57.720> you<00:04:57.780> got

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
per second at the exact second you got

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.730 
per second at the exact second you got
time<00:04:58.200> frame<00:04:58.620> of<00:04:58.890> how<00:04:59.070> long<00:04:59.310> and<00:04:59.700> it<00:04:59.910> is<00:05:00.090> and<00:05:00.360> I

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
time frame of how long and it is and I

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.440 
time frame of how long and it is and I
guess<00:05:01.740> frames<00:05:02.040> so<00:05:02.250> obviously<00:05:02.610> every<00:05:02.970> you<00:05:03.420> know

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.450 
guess frames so obviously every you know

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:08.060 
guess frames so obviously every you know
the<00:05:04.200> frames<00:05:04.470> are<00:05:04.620> keep<00:05:05.190> moving<00:05:05.550> on<00:05:05.670> you<00:05:07.070> this

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
the frames are keep moving on you this

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.580 
the frames are keep moving on you this
is<00:05:08.250> run<00:05:08.490> two<00:05:08.730> of<00:05:08.880> two<00:05:09.120> it's<00:05:09.960> the<00:05:10.020> same<00:05:10.230> exact

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
is run two of two it's the same exact

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.100 
is run two of two it's the same exact
thing<00:05:10.800> every<00:05:11.040> time<00:05:11.810> but<00:05:12.810> you'll<00:05:12.960> have<00:05:13.050> a

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
thing every time but you'll have a

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:14.540 
thing every time but you'll have a
little<00:05:13.320> difference<00:05:13.710> between<00:05:13.770> your<00:05:14.130> first<00:05:14.370> run

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
little difference between your first run

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.280 
little difference between your first run
and<00:05:14.670> second<00:05:15.030> run<00:05:15.150> not<00:05:15.510> majorly<00:05:15.870> but<00:05:16.170> you'll

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:16.290 
and second run not majorly but you'll

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.250 
and second run not majorly but you'll
have<00:05:16.470> a<00:05:16.500> difference<00:05:17.090> so<00:05:18.090> again<00:05:18.300> guys<00:05:18.450> is<00:05:18.660> 1920

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
have a difference so again guys is 1920

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:24.560 
have a difference so again guys is 1920
x<00:05:19.380> 1080<00:05:19.560> right<00:05:20.040> now<00:05:23.120> even<00:05:24.120> though<00:05:24.270> this<00:05:24.420> is

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
x 1080 right now even though this is

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.690 
x 1080 right now even though this is
2560<00:05:25.110> by<00:05:25.410> 1600<00:05:25.800> monitor<00:05:26.310> you<00:05:26.400> could<00:05:26.520> back<00:05:26.669> it

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:26.700 
2560 by 1600 monitor you could back it

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.630 
2560 by 1600 monitor you could back it
down<00:05:27.320> which<00:05:28.320> is<00:05:28.350> awesome<00:05:28.680> so<00:05:29.040> I'm<00:05:29.220> still<00:05:29.460> looks

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:29.640 
down which is awesome so I'm still looks

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.490 
down which is awesome so I'm still looks
great<00:05:29.790> so<00:05:30.360> I'm<00:05:30.510> very<00:05:30.540> happy<00:05:30.810> I<00:05:31.050> could<00:05:31.169> be<00:05:31.350> able

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
great so I'm very happy I could be able

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.410 
great so I'm very happy I could be able
to<00:05:31.560> do<00:05:31.650> this

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:36.420 

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:48.510 

so<00:05:37.260> should<00:05:37.530> be<00:05:37.560> finishing<00:05:37.950> up

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:54.110 

there<00:05:49.389> we<00:05:49.539> go

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.610 

what<00:05:54.750> I'm<00:05:54.810> going<00:05:54.960> to<00:05:54.990> do<00:05:55.139> is<00:05:55.320> I'm<00:05:55.470> going<00:05:55.500> to

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:56.870 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
save<00:05:55.830> this<00:05:55.979> to<00:05:56.160> the<00:05:56.250> end<00:05:56.370> the<00:05:56.550> show<00:05:56.699> you<00:05:56.760> two

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 
save this to the end the show you two

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:03.650 
save this to the end the show you two
comparisons<00:05:59.449> LLS<00:06:00.449> do<00:06:01.130> 2560<00:06:02.130> by<00:06:02.580> 1600<00:06:03.150> again

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:03.660 
comparisons LLS do 2560 by 1600 again

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.340 
comparisons LLS do 2560 by 1600 again
everything<00:06:04.020> is<00:06:04.050> maxed<00:06:04.440> out<00:06:04.560> to<00:06:04.740> write<00:06:04.860> the<00:06:04.949> x11

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:06.350 
everything is maxed out to write the x11

everything's<00:06:09.540> back<00:06:09.720> so<00:06:09.990> much<00:06:10.110> as<00:06:10.260> we<00:06:10.350> can<00:06:10.440> do

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:10.590 
everything's back so much as we can do

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:13.850 
everything's back so much as we can do
let's<00:06:11.130> run<00:06:11.280> the<00:06:11.430> benchmark
