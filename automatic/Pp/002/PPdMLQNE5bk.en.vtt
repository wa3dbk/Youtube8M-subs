six five nine chillin yes Cincinnati -
and<00:00:13.049> you<00:00:13.170> do<00:00:13.290> octa-core<00:00:13.650> for<00:00:14.009> tablets<00:00:14.309> also

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
and you do octa-core for tablets also

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.600 
and you do octa-core for tablets also
yes<00:00:15.120> also

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:20.610

problem here too and so this is shipping

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.650 
problem here too and so this is shipping
already<00:00:36.700> with<00:00:36.910> octa-core<00:00:37.320> 3G<00:00:38.320> don't<00:00:38.860> sin<00:00:39.100> yes

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
already with octa-core 3G don't sin yes

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.400 
already with octa-core 3G don't sin yes
and<00:00:40.660> what's<00:00:40.840> the<00:00:40.960> difference<00:00:41.080> between

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.410 
and what's the difference between

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.950 
and what's the difference between
octa-core<00:00:41.860> tablet<00:00:42.040> and<00:00:42.580> octa-core<00:00:42.820> food<00:00:43.239> do

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
octa-core tablet and octa-core food do

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.890 
octa-core tablet and octa-core food do
you<00:00:44.050> optimize<00:00:44.230> differently<00:00:45.450> because<00:00:46.450> the

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:46.900 
you optimize differently because the

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.869 
you optimize differently because the
size<00:00:47.110> is<00:00:47.140> different<00:00:47.680> so<00:00:47.920> we<00:00:48.130> provide<00:00:48.850> a

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879 
size is different so we provide a

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:52.170 
size is different so we provide a
different<00:00:49.420> reference<00:00:49.840> denied<00:00:50.410> for<00:00:51.180> its

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
different reference denied for its

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.020 
different reference denied for its
different<00:00:52.630> board<00:00:52.870> the<00:00:53.380> PCB<00:00:53.950> what<00:00:54.640> what<00:00:54.880> else

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
different board the PCB what what else

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.940 
different board the PCB what what else
is<00:00:55.210> different<00:00:55.330> is<00:00:55.570> the<00:00:55.600> chip<00:00:55.930> the<00:00:56.050> same<00:00:56.230> but

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:56.950 
is different is the chip the same but

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.750 
is different is the chip the same but
not<00:00:57.750> triple<00:00:58.750> biscuits<00:00:59.470> then<00:00:59.740> this<00:01:00.640> is<00:01:00.700> the

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
not triple biscuits then this is the

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.530 
not triple biscuits then this is the
same<00:01:01.410> paper<00:01:02.410> but<00:01:03.340> that's<00:01:03.610> the<00:01:03.910> PCB<00:01:04.300> or<00:01:04.330> is<00:01:04.509> a

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
same paper but that's the PCB or is a

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.290 
same paper but that's the PCB or is a
SOC<00:01:04.869> that<00:01:05.680> is<00:01:05.770> obviously<00:01:06.100> SOC<00:01:06.820> is<00:01:06.910> different

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.300 
SOC that is obviously SOC is different

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.749 
SOC that is obviously SOC is different
yeah<00:01:07.660> so<00:01:08.259> the<00:01:08.860> lake<00:01:09.009> for<00:01:09.130> example<00:01:09.550> you

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:09.759 
yeah so the lake for example you

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:10.950 
yeah so the lake for example you
supports<00:01:10.150> a<00:01:10.270> bigger<00:01:10.479> display

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
supports a bigger display

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.280 
supports a bigger display
Rutina<00:01:11.830> yes<00:01:12.460> also<00:01:12.880> the<00:01:13.060> support

what<00:02:31.000> is<00:02:31.060> this<00:02:37.410> which<00:02:38.410> is<00:02:38.610> quad-core<00:02:39.610> is<00:02:40.240> it

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
what is this which is quad-core is it

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.990 
what is this which is quad-core is it
the<00:02:40.540> same<00:02:41.070> 8125<00:02:42.070> is<00:02:42.490> it<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:42.760> same<00:02:42.940> as<00:02:44.370> 82<00:02:45.370> no

the same 8125 is it the same as 82 no
nothing<00:02:46.450> different<00:02:47.260> because<00:02:47.590> you<00:02:47.920> can<00:02:47.980> see

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
nothing different because you can see

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.010 
nothing different because you can see
like<00:02:48.460> the<00:02:48.610> frequency<00:02:49.180> is<00:02:49.240> different<00:02:49.390> and<00:02:49.870> also

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
like the frequency is different and also

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.650 
like the frequency is different and also
the<00:02:50.260> GPU<00:02:50.620> is<00:02:50.770> different<00:02:51.250> this<00:02:51.910> is<00:02:51.970> one<00:02:52.180> GPU<00:02:52.540> is

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
the GPU is different this is one GPU is

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.800 
the GPU is different this is one GPU is
imagination

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.830 

money<00:02:56.350> which<00:02:57.010> one<00:02:57.160> is<00:02:57.280> better

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
money which one is better

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.780 
money which one is better
you<00:02:58.840> cannot<00:02:59.050> say<00:02:59.230> but<00:02:59.650> so<00:03:00.340> you<00:03:00.400> have<00:03:00.580> both

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
you cannot say but so you have both

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:06.540 
you cannot say but so you have both
solutions<00:03:01.090> yes<00:03:02.050> and<00:03:04.110> 82<00:03:05.110> is<00:03:05.860> it<00:03:06.100> exactly<00:03:06.310> the

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
solutions yes and 82 is it exactly the

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.270 
solutions yes and 82 is it exactly the
same<00:03:06.580> as<00:03:06.880> 6<00:03:07.480> 5<00:03:07.690> 8<00:03:07.870> 2<00:03:08.020> or<00:03:08.350> is<00:03:08.710> also<00:03:09.010> the<00:03:09.100> same

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
same as 6 5 8 2 or is also the same

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.130 
same as 6 5 8 2 or is also the same
differences<00:03:09.730> like<00:03:09.970> you<00:03:10.420> do<00:03:10.600> over<00:03:10.840> here<00:03:10.870> with

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
differences like you do over here with

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.390 
differences like you do over here with
octa-core<00:03:11.410> tablet<00:03:12.160> optimizer<00:03:13.030> and<00:03:14.130> he<00:03:15.130> have<00:03:15.370> a

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
octa-core tablet optimizer and he have a

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:23.070 
octa-core tablet optimizer and he have a
t-38<00:03:16.030> to<00:03:16.330> also<00:03:16.690> fork<00:03:17.470> or<00:03:17.740> a<00:03:18.010> 7<00:03:20.700> 8<00:03:21.700> 1<00:03:21.970> 1<00:03:22.420> 7<00:03:22.660> so

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
t-38 to also fork or a 7 8 1 1 7 so

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.470 
t-38 to also fork or a 7 8 1 1 7 so
that's<00:03:23.200> the<00:03:23.440> typical<00:03:23.740> is<00:03:24.520> that<00:03:24.760> Wi-Fi<00:03:25.330> only

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
that's the typical is that Wi-Fi only

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.809 
that's the typical is that Wi-Fi only
joke<00:03:26.170> all<00:03:26.380> right<00:03:27.930> 81<00:03:28.930> he<00:03:29.200> said

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 
joke all right 81 he said

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:38.560 
joke all right 81 he said
so<00:03:32.519> 81

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:46.380 

the<00:03:39.570> quad<00:03:39.780> core<00:03:40.020> dual<00:03:40.200> core<00:03:40.440> yes<00:03:43.520> all<00:03:44.520> right

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
the quad core dual core yes all right

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.410 
the quad core dual core yes all right
all<00:03:47.390> right<00:03:47.599> so<00:03:48.310> how<00:03:49.310> big<00:03:49.459> is<00:03:49.580> media<00:03:50.120> take<00:03:50.270> four

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
all right so how big is media take four

00:03:50.420 --> 00:04:01.540 
all right so how big is media take four
tablets<00:03:58.690> the<00:03:59.690> Wi-Fi<00:04:00.050> only<00:04:00.080> has<00:04:00.860> lower<00:04:01.220> power

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:01.550 
tablets the Wi-Fi only has lower power

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.540 
tablets the Wi-Fi only has lower power
consumption<00:04:02.180> yes<00:04:03.050> compared<00:04:03.440> to<00:04:03.590> the<00:04:03.739> basement

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.550 
consumption yes compared to the basement

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:12.520 
consumption yes compared to the basement
version<00:04:05.060> yes<00:04:05.390> how<00:04:06.080> much<00:04:06.230> difference<00:04:11.530> 20%

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
version yes how much difference 20%

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.309 
version yes how much difference 20%
lower<00:04:12.650> yeah<00:04:13.310> do<00:04:13.670> you<00:04:13.760> do<00:04:13.880> any<00:04:14.170> Wi-Fi<00:04:15.170> only

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:15.319 
lower yeah do you do any Wi-Fi only

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:19.180 
lower yeah do you do any Wi-Fi only
SmartWatch<00:04:16.010> CPU<00:04:17.079> like<00:04:18.079> they<00:04:18.260> use<00:04:18.440> a<00:04:18.470> six<00:04:18.979> five

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
SmartWatch CPU like they use a six five

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.409 
SmartWatch CPU like they use a six five
seven<00:04:19.430> two<00:04:19.729> here<00:04:20.030> you<00:04:20.530> could<00:04:21.530> use<00:04:21.560> this<00:04:21.979> one

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
seven two here you could use this one

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:28.409 
seven two here you could use this one
eight<00:04:23.419> one<00:04:23.479> one<00:04:23.930> seven<00:04:24.320> in<00:04:24.560> the<00:04:24.650> SmartWatch

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:33.159 

trainer<00:04:29.479> it<00:04:29.600> has<00:04:29.780> bluetooth<00:04:32.169> integrators

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.169 
trainer it has bluetooth integrators

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:42.090 
trainer it has bluetooth integrators
which<00:04:33.740> is<00:04:33.889> for<00:04:34.160> yes<00:04:34.820> all<00:04:35.030> of<00:04:35.270> them<00:04:35.510> it<00:04:35.900> is<00:04:36.050> for

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.320 

so<00:04:43.100> how<00:04:43.280> would<00:04:43.340> you<00:04:43.430> say<00:04:43.610> is<00:04:43.760> the<00:04:43.790> performance

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
so how would you say is the performance

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.430 
so how would you say is the performance
of<00:04:44.600> your<00:04:44.740> dual<00:04:45.740> quad<00:04:46.220> and<00:04:46.600> eight<00:04:47.600> core<00:04:47.870> the

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
of your dual quad and eight core the

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.529 
of your dual quad and eight core the
eight<00:04:48.590> core<00:04:48.860> is<00:04:49.130> a<00:04:49.160> higher<00:04:49.970> performance<00:04:50.450> than

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:50.539 
eight core is a higher performance than

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:53.690 
eight core is a higher performance than
a<00:04:51.070> quad<00:04:52.070> core<00:04:52.250> e9<00:04:52.550> or

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 
a quad core e9 or

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.390 
a quad core e9 or
yeah<00:04:54.300> they<00:04:55.140> called<00:04:55.410> definitely<00:04:56.190> the

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
yeah they called definitely the

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.990 
yeah they called definitely the
performers<00:04:56.880> even<00:04:57.180> much<00:04:57.870> higher<00:04:58.850> and<00:04:59.850> it

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
performers even much higher and it

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.760 
performers even much higher and it
scales<00:05:00.240> very<00:05:00.450> very<00:05:01.050> low<00:05:01.140> power<00:05:01.380> consumption

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
scales very very low power consumption

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.930 
scales very very low power consumption
yes<00:05:02.400> because<00:05:02.910> we<00:05:03.240> using<00:05:04.250> our<00:05:05.250> Soviet<00:05:05.700> control

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
yes because we using our Soviet control

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.660 
yes because we using our Soviet control
to<00:05:06.600> dynamically<00:05:07.410> change<00:05:08.100> the<00:05:08.190> whole

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:08.670 
to dynamically change the whole

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:12.650 
to dynamically change the whole
frequency<00:05:09.480> and<00:05:09.960> also<00:05:10.370> and<00:05:11.370> of<00:05:11.550> the<00:05:11.820> core<00:05:12.360> if

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
frequency and also and of the core if

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.690 
frequency and also and of the core if
you<00:05:12.870> you<00:05:13.200> don't<00:05:13.440> need<00:05:13.530> need<00:05:13.920> to<00:05:13.950> use<00:05:14.190> this<00:05:14.400> one

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 
you you don't need need to use this one

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.910 
you you don't need need to use this one
yeah<00:05:15.150> so<00:05:15.360> we<00:05:15.510> can<00:05:15.690> set<00:05:16.200> the<00:05:16.350> power<00:05:16.560> but<00:05:16.860> you

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:16.920 
yeah so we can set the power but you

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:21.230 
yeah so we can set the power but you
don't<00:05:17.130> need<00:05:17.280> much<00:05:18.120> power<00:05:18.480> this<00:05:19.290> is<00:05:19.470> a<00:05:20.240> specific

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
don't need much power this is a specific

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.290 
don't need much power this is a specific
expertise<00:05:21.930> for<00:05:22.110> me<00:05:22.200> attack<00:05:22.670> very<00:05:23.670> no<00:05:23.820> very

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
expertise for me attack very no very

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.010 
expertise for me attack very no very
high<00:05:24.420> yes

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
high yes

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.320 
high yes
all<00:05:25.650> right<00:05:25.800> and<00:05:26.160> this<00:05:26.640> is<00:05:26.700> very<00:05:26.850> useful<00:05:26.940> for

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
all right and this is very useful for

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:28.970 
all right and this is very useful for
tablet<00:05:27.600> also<00:05:27.840> even<00:05:28.350> though<00:05:28.440> the<00:05:28.560> screen<00:05:28.800> is

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:28.980 
tablet also even though the screen is

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.500 
tablet also even though the screen is
very<00:05:29.010> is<00:05:29.310> its<00:05:29.580> most<00:05:29.760> power<00:05:30.030> is<00:05:30.180> the<00:05:30.270> screen

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510 
very is its most power is the screen

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:34.460 
very is its most power is the screen
there's<00:05:30.720> not<00:05:30.840> MediaTek<00:05:31.260> right<00:05:31.560> all<00:05:32.310> right
