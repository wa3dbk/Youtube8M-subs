00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.139
 hi people thanks for turning on 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:11.940
 the lg 3 is with 146 30 74 68 95 mm with 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.679
 safety is not the thinnest or 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.529
 smallest smartphone on the market 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.730
 That's why we ask ourselves today it fits in 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.140
 the trouser pocket 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.000
 that's exactly what I'm going to do with several 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.279
 I want to try different pants 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.289
 have fun 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:28.109
 We start because we are in the summer 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.960
 stuck with a me say loose 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.820
 Short summer pants has big pockets 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.800
 here it fits in perfectly is disturbing too 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.780
 not when moving or standing around 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.300
 it gets a bit tighter we have one 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.100
 long pants on but also here you can feel 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.350
 that you have the thick hard in the 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.350
 But it does not really matter, but it does not really matter 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.910
 while walking you notice it and now 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.500
 it gets really tight 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.360
 Now you can feel it all the time 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.070
 that you have something on the leg steps to leave 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.289
 but still do it 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.780
 how is the whole thing but when we sit 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.199
 for example, when driving or in the 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.789
 school 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.270
 Here you can clearly see that one 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.739
 there was something else that did not matter 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.170
 you can still in all positions 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.960
 However, I would just sit there 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.060
 because it is little comfortable maybe 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.070
 put on the table or somehow on 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.070
 the passenger seat in the school then in 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.689
 the bag or where else what 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.400
 I would like to say in conclusion no matter 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.200
 if we have tight pants or too 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.939
 of course women now with theirs 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.259
 right very tight things there you have 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.750
 no fun with them because they do not 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.549
 bags names but normal pants there 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.509
 like to have a bit tighter no 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.000
 problem 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.040
 good that with this video if you like 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.409
 have or would like to know if the note 3 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.210
 fits in your pocket or even that 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.950
 lg the flex that you still my corner 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.090
 bigger then you can do that 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.579
 look at both here 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.579
