out<00:01:08.939> here<00:01:09.150> I<00:01:09.840> know<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.439> warp<00:01:10.740> gate<00:01:10.890> is<00:01:10.979> something

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
out here I know a warp gate is something

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.359 
out here I know a warp gate is something
that<00:01:11.310> has<00:01:11.490> been<00:01:11.520> discussed<00:01:12.150> quite<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.540> bit

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
that has been discussed quite a bit

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:16.460 
that has been discussed quite a bit
about<00:01:14.369> how<00:01:14.520> ridiculous<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.420> is<00:01:15.570> i<00:01:15.810> think<00:01:16.350> more

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
about how ridiculous it is i think more

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.260 
about how ridiculous it is i think more
kate<00:01:16.650> has<00:01:16.860> made<00:01:17.070> Protoss<00:01:17.580> really<00:01:17.820> interesting

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
kate has made Protoss really interesting

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.050 
kate has made Protoss really interesting
to<00:01:18.360> play<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.810> play<00:01:18.900> against<00:01:19.340> but<00:01:20.340> decreasing

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
to play and play against but decreasing

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.460 
to play and play against but decreasing
or<00:01:21.270> rather<00:01:21.420> increasing<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.020> amount<00:01:22.200> of<00:01:22.229> time

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
or rather increasing the amount of time

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.770 
or rather increasing the amount of time
it<00:01:22.619> takes<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.979> build<00:01:23.280> is<00:01:24.180> probably<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.720> good

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
it takes to build is probably a good

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.440 
it takes to build is probably a good
change<00:01:25.229> overall<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.100> so<00:01:26.310> I'm<00:01:26.850> pretty<00:01:27.330> happy

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
change overall and so I'm pretty happy

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.539 
change overall and so I'm pretty happy
with<00:01:27.720> that<00:01:28.619> change<00:01:28.890> looking<00:01:29.250> forward<00:01:29.460> to

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
with that change looking forward to

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:30.890 
with that change looking forward to

going<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:39.960> find<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.259> Protoss<00:01:40.560> space<00:01:40.799> right

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
going to find the Protoss space right

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.090 
going to find the Protoss space right
off<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.610> bat<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.090> is<00:01:42.329> going<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.570> see<00:01:43.100> pretty

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
off the bat and is going to see pretty

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.889 
off the bat and is going to see pretty
certain<00:01:44.250> opening<00:01:44.579> here<00:01:44.759> gateway<00:01:45.360> being<00:01:45.720> put

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
certain opening here gateway being put

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.690 
certain opening here gateway being put
down<00:01:45.930> Protoss<00:01:46.590> taking<00:01:46.890> his<00:01:47.009> first<00:01:47.159> simulator

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
down Protoss taking his first simulator

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.210 
down Protoss taking his first simulator
so<00:01:48.030> pretty<00:01:48.930> standard<00:01:49.350> play<00:01:49.560> chrono<00:01:49.860> boosting

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
so pretty standard play chrono boosting

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.240 
so pretty standard play chrono boosting
out<00:01:50.310> some<00:01:50.729> probes<00:01:51.619> artosis<00:01:52.619> is<00:01:52.860> putting<00:01:53.100> up<00:01:53.159> a

I do know what happens here I will say
it<00:02:16.260> is<00:02:16.320> an<00:02:16.440> interesting<00:02:16.620> game<00:02:16.980> in<00:02:17.610> which<00:02:17.760> we<00:02:17.850> do

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
it is an interesting game in which we do

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.670 
it is an interesting game in which we do
see<00:02:18.120> artosis<00:02:18.330> make<00:02:18.990> a<00:02:19.020> lot<00:02:19.200> of<00:02:19.230> interesting

molested so he's able to see the photos
take<00:03:05.010> a<00:03:05.040> second<00:03:05.460> gateway<00:03:05.580> and<00:03:05.940> second<00:03:06.330> a

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
take a second gateway and second a

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.290 
take a second gateway and second a
simulator<00:03:06.630> here<00:03:07.880> and<00:03:08.880> bring<00:03:09.030> up<00:03:09.150> the

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
simulator here and bring up the

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.060 
simulator here and bring up the
production<00:03:09.840> for<00:03:10.050> both<00:03:10.170> players<00:03:10.350> now<00:03:10.740> and<00:03:10.980> so

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
production for both players now and so

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.590 
production for both players now and so
we<00:03:11.190> have<00:03:11.340> warp<00:03:11.580> gate<00:03:11.760> researching<00:03:12.270> of<00:03:12.360> course

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
we have warp gate researching of course

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.450 
we have warp gate researching of course
right<00:03:12.840> off<00:03:12.960> the<00:03:12.990> bat<00:03:13.230> as<00:03:13.830> soon<00:03:14.010> as<00:03:14.130> that<00:03:14.220> first

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
right off the bat as soon as that first

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.220 
right off the bat as soon as that first
cybernetics<00:03:15.240> core<00:03:15.420> is<00:03:15.510> done<00:03:15.720> and<00:03:15.960> so<00:03:16.080> this

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
cybernetics core is done and so this

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.510 
cybernetics core is done and so this
warp<00:03:16.500> gate<00:03:16.620> research<00:03:16.920> will<00:03:17.100> proceed<00:03:17.370> quickly

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
warp gate research will proceed quickly

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.340 
warp gate research will proceed quickly
and<00:03:17.850> is<00:03:18.240> being<00:03:18.390> chrono<00:03:18.630> boosted<00:03:18.959> further<00:03:19.200> by

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
and is being chrono boosted further by

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.170 
and is being chrono boosted further by
the<00:03:19.410> Protoss<00:03:19.740> player<00:03:20.010> which<00:03:20.850> will<00:03:21.030> really

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
the Protoss player which will really

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.449 
the Protoss player which will really
hasten<00:03:21.570> the<00:03:21.660> speed<00:03:21.870> at<00:03:22.020> which<00:03:22.050> it's<00:03:22.470> that<00:03:23.010> that

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
factory the Protoss player has not even

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.750 
factory the Protoss player has not even
begun<00:03:46.050> to<00:03:46.320> build<00:03:46.590> a<00:03:46.770> single<00:03:47.160> unit<00:03:47.459> yet<00:03:47.640> it

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
begun to build a single unit yet it

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.949 
begun to build a single unit yet it
looks<00:03:47.790> like<00:03:48.000> he<00:03:48.150> may<00:03:48.270> be<00:03:48.330> waiting<00:03:48.600> for<00:03:48.870> his

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
looks like he may be waiting for his

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.420 
looks like he may be waiting for his
warp<00:03:49.230> gate<00:03:49.410> research<00:03:49.680> to<00:03:49.830> finish<00:03:50.070> before<00:03:50.190> he

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
warp gate research to finish before he

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.860 
warp gate research to finish before he
even<00:03:50.580> summons<00:03:51.000> his<00:03:51.120> first<00:03:51.420> xelok<00:03:53.600> yeah<00:03:54.600> and<00:03:54.780> we

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
even summons his first xelok yeah and we

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.510 
even summons his first xelok yeah and we
are<00:03:54.959> seeing<00:03:55.140> that<00:03:55.320> now<00:03:55.380> so<00:03:55.830> warfare<00:03:56.370> research

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 
are seeing that now so warfare research

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.240 
are seeing that now so warfare research
finishes

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
finishes

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:59.950 
finishes
and<00:03:58.340> now<00:03:58.820> a<00:03:58.850> third<00:03:59.270> gateway<00:03:59.570> being<00:03:59.780> put<00:03:59.930> down

00:03:59.950 --> 00:03:59.960 
and now a third gateway being put down

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:05.740 
and now a third gateway being put down
for<00:04:00.170> the<00:04:00.260> Protoss<00:04:00.560> player<00:04:02.950> and<00:04:04.750> otherwise

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
for the Protoss player and otherwise

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.620 
for the Protoss player and otherwise
when<00:04:06.290> the<00:04:06.380> warp<00:04:06.590> gates<00:04:07.030> look<00:04:08.030> it's<00:04:08.270> coming<00:04:08.510> up

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
when the warp gates look it's coming up

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.110 
when the warp gates look it's coming up
here<00:04:08.840> and<00:04:09.560> now<00:04:10.340> even<00:04:10.610> these<00:04:10.700> are<00:04:10.820> finished

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
here and now even these are finished

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.370 
here and now even these are finished
okay<00:04:11.300> now<00:04:11.420> we<00:04:11.480> have<00:04:11.600> the<00:04:11.660> first<00:04:11.840> unit<00:04:12.140> so

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
okay now we have the first unit so

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.230 
okay now we have the first unit so
stalker<00:04:12.710> and<00:04:12.980> a<00:04:13.070> century<00:04:13.580> coming<00:04:13.820> in<00:04:14.030> for<00:04:14.180> the

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:14.240 
stalker and a century coming in for the

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.790 
stalker and a century coming in for the
Protoss<00:04:14.540> player<00:04:14.810> has<00:04:14.959> its<00:04:15.140> first<00:04:15.320> two<00:04:15.500> units

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:15.800 
Protoss player has its first two units

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.970 
Protoss player has its first two units
these<00:04:16.310> should<00:04:16.640> clean<00:04:16.880> up<00:04:16.910> the<00:04:17.329> SCV<00:04:18.290> scout<00:04:18.590> and

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:18.980 
these should clean up the SCV scout and

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.009 
these should clean up the SCV scout and
improve<00:04:19.400> no<00:04:19.579> difficulty<00:04:20.030> here<00:04:20.239> we<00:04:20.570> also<00:04:20.720> Pro

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
improve no difficulty here we also Pro

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:22.240 
improve no difficulty here we also Pro
coming<00:04:21.290> out<00:04:21.350> of<00:04:21.380> the<00:04:21.470> Protoss<00:04:21.709> players<00:04:21.950> base

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
coming out of the Protoss players base

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.670 
coming out of the Protoss players base
this<00:04:22.460> will<00:04:22.640> likely<00:04:22.850> be<00:04:23.120> to<00:04:23.300> put<00:04:23.960> down<00:04:24.080> a<00:04:24.140> proxy

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
this will likely be to put down a proxy

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.190 
this will likely be to put down a proxy
pylon<00:04:24.860> closer<00:04:25.430> to<00:04:25.610> the<00:04:25.700> Terran<00:04:25.970> space<00:04:26.210> since

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
pylon closer to the Terran space since

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.420 
pylon closer to the Terran space since
the<00:04:27.470> Protoss<00:04:27.740> player<00:04:27.920> should<00:04:28.040> know<00:04:28.220> by<00:04:28.400> now

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
the Protoss player should know by now

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:29.620 
the Protoss player should know by now
that<00:04:28.550> it<00:04:28.760> provides<00:04:29.090> no<00:04:29.210> chance<00:04:29.420> of<00:04:29.510> actually

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
that it provides no chance of actually

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.810 
that it provides no chance of actually
getting<00:04:29.900> in<00:04:30.110> as<00:04:30.200> a<00:04:30.230> scout<00:04:30.590> I<00:04:30.860> have<00:04:31.490> to<00:04:31.610> assume

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
getting in as a scout I have to assume

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.120 
getting in as a scout I have to assume
that<00:04:31.970> this<00:04:32.060> is<00:04:32.210> for<00:04:32.419> a<00:04:32.450> proxy<00:04:32.780> pylon<00:04:32.930> and<00:04:33.260> so

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
that this is for a proxy pylon and so

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:35.680 
that this is for a proxy pylon and so
we're<00:04:34.400> probably<00:04:34.760> going<00:04:35.000> to<00:04:35.090> see<00:04:35.270> that<00:04:35.480> over

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
we're probably going to see that over

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.810 
we're probably going to see that over
nearby<00:04:36.260> the<00:04:36.320> bushes<00:04:36.740> here<00:04:37.070> which<00:04:37.370> block<00:04:37.640> line

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
nearby the bushes here which block line

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.130 
nearby the bushes here which block line
of<00:04:37.940> sight<00:04:38.150> making<00:04:38.419> them<00:04:38.600> a<00:04:38.660> great<00:04:38.840> place<00:04:39.020> to

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.140 
of sight making them a great place to

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.760 
of sight making them a great place to
put<00:04:39.290> proxy<00:04:39.560> pylons<00:04:39.919> or<00:04:40.130> we<00:04:40.280> may<00:04:40.490> see<00:04:40.550> it<00:04:41.770> let's

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
put proxy pylons or we may see it let's

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.800 
put proxy pylons or we may see it let's
see<00:04:42.919> closer<00:04:43.190> to<00:04:43.370> the<00:04:43.460> rocks<00:04:43.730> of<00:04:44.480> course<00:04:44.720> a

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
see closer to the rocks of course a

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.680 
see closer to the rocks of course a
pylon<00:04:45.530> in<00:04:45.650> the<00:04:45.740> lower<00:04:45.980> area<00:04:46.790> I<00:04:47.150> believe<00:04:47.480> can

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
pylon in the lower area I believe can

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.120 
pylon in the lower area I believe can
warp<00:04:47.930> directly<00:04:48.230> units<00:04:48.560> darkly<00:04:48.800> up<00:04:48.919> to<00:04:49.010> the
