00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.260
 Hmm 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.980
 Hey, people, I'm here to explain. 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.000
 for you some of the development 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.240
 from my sneakers 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.840
 the first promotes material labor 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:28.390
 used in my model is a suede 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.279
 differentiated is more adherent and also in the 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.920
 durability 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:35.500
 I thought it was better that the girl 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.200
 traditional because I used to have sneakers 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.329
 enough time thus getting enough and 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.070
 it did not leak into anything and I chose 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:44.050
 also one thing that makes difference yes 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.969
 I always realized is the stitching of the 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.239
 His singing really is a very 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:51.309
 close to the finger so the tennis he 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:52.960
 As he gets a lot of flip he ends up 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.329
 wearing then made more 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.149
 behind as well as a way 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:01.620
 yes but only love and our design goes 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:01.620
 Talk a little better for you to leave. 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.800
 always told me he wanted a 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.800
 shoes that had nothing in the environment 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:11.230
 totally smooth public there until the 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.720
 first type floppy disks thinking about 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.340
 His shoes were a type he had not 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.440
 nothing had no stitching but there 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.250
 came the idea of â€‹â€‹using the grape point 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.900
 joins two pieces of material places the 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.560
 it addresses them inwards and from there arises 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.560
 some solution 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.180
 I opted for a very simple design so 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.280
 because I've never liked tennis with 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.610
 a lot of things that I liked more 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:41.050
 discreet and his sole the spine of fish 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:43.480
 that is the one you and also something 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.310
 also that I always saw in sneakers 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.890
 when I was little such that I wore sneakers 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.320
 skateboard was that little gol 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.840
 tongue you store a 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.970
 something like that to talk a little about 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.540
 the insole that is also a technology 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:00.460
 new one used by will see that soon and is 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.440
 a photo that I really like so 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.520
 stayed fernando martins 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.070
 I think a lot of people will identify 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.780
 why the perfect shoe store client 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:12.989
 both of design and of material and 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.989
 test there
