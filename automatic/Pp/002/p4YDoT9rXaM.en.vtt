00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.949
 the special thing about this data is the 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:26.460
 We have been very much influenced by 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:37.829
 the fees for us was important 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:39.980
 the square ones we commit 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.540
 always wanted to and 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:46.610
 minimalist little care as possible 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:50.300
 But experts go we have the city 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.300
 work with elements work 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:59.160
 discover 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:01:03.210
 but also this study after 10 600 and 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:08.850
 Children also in the night big room 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:10.530
 Government sent foreground create 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.000
 I actually get through the idea myself 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.380
 to move the garden and also one 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.330
 need not with the garden too 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.440
 So that's what it means at the moment 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.399
 I'm not just on the 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.110
 terrace stays 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:21.149
 also very fast to the 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.450
 result went our online I have 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:27.599
 the customer, however, a delight in the garden 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.960
 on two of the choice of plants 

00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:31.659
 we have one 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.930
 even fewer elements accelerate this 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:35.670
 are in total 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.730
 cut hedge elements we as 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.750
 Erdogan before defeated on the internet 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:43.600
 long weeks are covered too 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.620
 regular care require thereby 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.980
 annoy a long time 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.030
 in fact we have the high jump of the 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:57.170
 border 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:59.000
 We have currently had many flowers 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:04.060
 from really not wished up 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.060
 few exceptions this and 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.260
 more powerful but an element that 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.930
 is coming right now at this time 

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.790
 the potential also this sphere 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.680
 again in the plant with again gladly 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.450
 that is also the case in schools 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.050
 taken the essential and everything 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:23.990
 different oil shades in the corners 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.770
 we have the variety left and right 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.370
 retro flower 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.860
 this is true 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:33.130
 twenties we are for a big search 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:36.370
 flowers are not quite complete 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.710
 light and airy in the myth and the 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:43.060
 Foliage coloring in the course of the year one 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:46.680
 customer and a permanent mexico us 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.680
 have here as a house tree with tall trees 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:03:00.190
 wintergreen pastor landscape like but 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:02.860
 After that , the work is not over 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.140
 But then I wanted the task of 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.620
 gardening and that attitude and 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.910
 street trains camp gerhard pankow going on 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.380
 when the big cut in autumn 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.870
 Of course , there will not be any 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.700
 landscape will be all education with 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.160
 objected cuts and simple 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.959
 how it looks like quickly 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.520
 restores the contours 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.209
 main elements taken invite 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.580
 feel good 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:28.060
 Water plays calming when 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:30.730
 you sit here as the eye can keep what 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.489
 and rain plan through the data always 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.320
 are again points and up with heights 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.800
 and deep 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.690
 the blank 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.540
 out to another to form very and 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:43.630
 is a very big our garden 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:46.930
 means is the withdrawal from everyday life that 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:49.920
 relax with it a little oasis in the 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.920
 we have been comfortable
