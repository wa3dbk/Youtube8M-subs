00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 the canvas imac line harness that i 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.010
 I have to get married again because I was 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.769
 long time, I'll show you 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.990
 how do you do that is to get married 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.960
 one of the great advantages of the game is 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.890
 You have more to spot the case at 2 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.810
 to power groups jutahy map does not need 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.300
 be taking two 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.359
 I think it's a distance of 15 screens and 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.599
 can bring together with your 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:35.489
 bride and groom and then I was just one in 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:37.290
 front and so it goes much easier is the 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.020
 What do you need to get married in here? 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.500
 church door 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:49.890
 after the 6 3 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:51.840
 or the machine and have two alliances such 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:01:00.660
 alliances can be achieved in the 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:01:03.890
 ur 02 is there npc there that sells and only 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:08.070
 need to have a thousand beds and I think 50 gold 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:11.040
 go there and buy it when you get here in 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.110
 church door or before but the 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.250
 It's important that you do not go in there. 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:21.560
 here is the ring on the fingers 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.670
 their the two will get married and 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.700
 But it has to be out here that there 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.310
 inside I do not think I can make a change 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.770
 of other paraphernalia more is that you 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.040
 can use to make marriage and 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:38.220
 bride and groom hoodie etc 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.740
 But that's better for those who want to celebrate. 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.530
 marrying friends, it's just me 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.270
 I'm just going to use the two rings and then I'm going 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.720
 log in 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.720
 The good thing about the game is that you do not need to 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:55.009
 being a man and a woman can be a woman with 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:02:00.119
 Powerful woman getting married 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:01.649
 little cape here the groom little cape go 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:06.270
 have to give a hope had here that 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:07.829
 There are people getting married and promised. 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.929
 his wedding 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:13.520
 but what the little hat does not do 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.520
 difference does not need only for a 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:23.160
 I had no look I think it already occupies 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:27.840
 The place I'm going to worry about pink 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:32.040
 Then you 'll talk to the priest that the 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.780
 old ghetto mary nÃ© my game in english 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.120

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:43.410
 Married and will you ask? 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:50.010
 Yes, I want to marry with ready scratches. 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:52.769
 thence it ended up completely divorced and 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.269
 You have to come here and talk to the priest but 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.239
 have to pay 50 kaka 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:03:01.019

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:04.080
 it 's easy to invite to 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:07.050
 globe or follow or join that 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.760

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:13.580
 look like you're married to cane 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:16.500
 so for example to vacate here 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:23.310
 keep doing something there I do not 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:28.829
 I do not care, I'm going to another map with 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:33.030
