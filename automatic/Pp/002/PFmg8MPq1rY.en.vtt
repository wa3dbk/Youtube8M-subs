00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
it's just flatly false in fact you can

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.000 
it's just flatly false in fact you can
look<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.570> publicly<00:00:55.020> known<00:00:55.199> statements<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:55.860> the

look to publicly known statements of the
intelligence<00:00:56.460> community<00:00:56.660> including<00:00:57.660> from<00:00:58.020> a

intelligence community including from a

intelligence community including from a
former<00:00:58.710> outgoing<00:00:59.309> director<00:01:00.030> of<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.239> Defense

former outgoing director of the Defense

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.510 
former outgoing director of the Defense
Intelligence<00:01:00.570> Agency<00:01:00.989> general<00:01:01.590> Flynn<00:01:01.859> that

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
Intelligence Agency general Flynn that

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.340 
Intelligence Agency general Flynn that
this<00:01:02.879> was<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.239> big<00:01:03.449> threat<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:03.780> in<00:01:03.960> fact<00:01:04.140> they

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
this was a big threat and in fact they

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.870 
this was a big threat and in fact they
were<00:01:04.409> probably<00:01:04.920> going<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.220> be<00:01:05.339> setting<00:01:05.610> up<00:01:05.700> a

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
were probably going to be setting up a

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.700 
were probably going to be setting up a
Caliphate<00:01:06.570> in<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.960> relatively<00:01:07.470> near<00:01:07.650> future

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
Caliphate in the relatively near future

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.859 
Caliphate in the relatively near future
so<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.640> was<00:01:08.820> very<00:01:08.939> clear<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.570> what<00:01:09.689> President

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
so it was very clear and what President

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.960 
so it was very clear and what President
Obama's<00:01:10.380> done<00:01:10.530> here<00:01:10.830> is<00:01:11.010> essentially

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
Obama's done here is essentially

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.070 
Obama's done here is essentially
throwing<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.299> intelligence<00:01:12.720> community

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
throwing the intelligence community

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.539 
throwing the intelligence community
under<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.470> bus<00:01:13.650> because<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.159> makes<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.460> look

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
under the bus because it makes it look

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.700 
under the bus because it makes it look
like<00:01:14.880> somebody<00:01:15.450> else<00:01:15.630> is<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.170> blame<00:01:16.290> this<00:01:16.590> is

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
like somebody else is to blame this is

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.140 
like somebody else is to blame this is
of<00:01:16.830> course<00:01:16.950> not<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.280> new<00:01:17.490> thing<00:01:17.790> for<00:01:18.030> this

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
of course not a new thing for this

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.789 
of course not a new thing for this
administration<00:01:18.780> it's<00:01:18.930> just<00:01:19.110> perhaps<00:01:19.560> a

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
administration it's just perhaps a

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.020 
administration it's just perhaps a
little<00:01:19.890> new<00:01:20.130> on<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.369> foreign<00:01:20.610> policy<00:01:21.000> front

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
little new on the foreign policy front

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.940 
little new on the foreign policy front
right<00:01:21.630> well<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.320> wouldn't<00:01:22.560> James

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
right well and and wouldn't James

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.710 
right well and and wouldn't James
clapper<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.520> mean<00:01:23.670> if<00:01:23.759> James<00:01:24.030> clapper<00:01:24.420> was

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
clapper I mean if James clapper was

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.950 
clapper I mean if James clapper was
really<00:01:25.140> genuinely<00:01:25.790> implicated<00:01:26.790> in<00:01:26.909> this<00:01:27.030> why

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
really genuinely implicated in this why

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.760 
really genuinely implicated in this why
does<00:01:28.170> he<00:01:28.409> still<00:01:28.619> have<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.770> job

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
does he still have a job

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.950 
does he still have a job
well<00:01:31.770> clapper<00:01:32.220> has<00:01:32.400> been<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.670> pretty<00:01:33.000> good<00:01:33.689> and

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
well clapper has been a pretty good and

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.899 
well clapper has been a pretty good and
stalwart<00:01:34.470> partisan<00:01:35.100> for<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.310> administration

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
stalwart partisan for the administration

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.640 
stalwart partisan for the administration
a<00:01:35.939> sense<00:01:36.329> that<00:01:36.479> he's<00:01:36.570> been<00:01:36.720> willing<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.470> toe

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
as a result I just think you would think

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.069 
as a result I just think you would think
that<00:02:35.879> this<00:02:36.060> administration<00:02:36.690> would<00:02:36.780> sort<00:02:37.019> of

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:37.079 
that this administration would sort of

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:39.050 
that this administration would sort of
follow<00:02:37.319> up<00:02:37.530> on<00:02:37.680> that<00:02:37.709> for<00:02:38.099> the<00:02:38.250> optics<00:02:38.790> but

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
follow up on that for the optics but

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.910 
follow up on that for the optics but
they<00:02:39.629> haven't<00:02:40.200> I<00:02:40.260> mean<00:02:40.409> well<00:02:40.590> they<00:02:40.680> didn't<00:02:40.829> let

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
they haven't I mean well they didn't let

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.830 
they haven't I mean well they didn't let
Susan<00:02:41.190> Rice<00:02:41.519> go<00:02:41.790> they<00:02:42.030> haven't<00:02:42.390> let<00:02:42.510> Eric

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
Susan Rice go they haven't let Eric

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.170 
Susan Rice go they haven't let Eric
Holder<00:02:43.200> go<00:02:43.500> he<00:02:43.799> willingly<00:02:44.159> resigned<00:02:44.700> to<00:02:44.970> save

Holder go he willingly resigned to save

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.990 
Holder go he willingly resigned to save
them<00:02:45.390> so<00:02:45.680> yeah<00:02:46.680> I<00:02:46.799> think<00:02:47.159> they<00:02:47.459> just<00:02:47.670> what<00:02:47.849> they

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
them so yeah I think they just what they

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.880 
them so yeah I think they just what they
that<00:02:48.299> this<00:02:48.599> this<00:02:48.870> president's<00:02:49.409> admission<00:02:49.769> is

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
that this this president's admission is

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.470 
that this this president's admission is
pretty<00:02:50.099> much<00:02:50.190> all<00:02:50.400> it<00:02:50.519> is<00:02:50.639> and<00:02:50.909> go<00:02:51.120> on<00:02:51.299> with

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
pretty much all it is and go on with

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.860 
pretty much all it is and go on with
business<00:02:51.659> as<00:02:51.959> usual<00:02:53.209> this<00:02:54.209> president<00:02:54.690> has

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
business as usual this president has

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.629 
business as usual this president has
done<00:02:55.139> one<00:02:55.590> thing<00:02:55.799> he's<00:02:56.010> done<00:02:56.069> a<00:02:56.129> few<00:02:56.340> things

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:56.639 
done one thing he's done a few things

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:59.270 
done one thing he's done a few things
well<00:02:57.389> and<00:02:57.530> what's<00:02:58.530> that<00:02:58.680> I<00:02:58.769> think<00:02:58.980> close<00:02:59.159> to

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
well and what's that I think close to

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.410 
well and what's that I think close to
the<00:02:59.370> top<00:02:59.549> of<00:02:59.700> listing<00:03:00.030> it<00:03:00.150> would<00:03:00.269> be

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
the top of listing it would be

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.720 
the top of listing it would be
surrounding<00:03:01.170> himself<00:03:01.290> with<00:03:01.620> party<00:03:02.489> hacks

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
surrounding himself with party hacks

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.270 
surrounding himself with party hacks
essentially<00:03:03.329> partisans<00:03:03.959> who<00:03:04.440> put<00:03:04.650> loyalty<00:03:05.099> to

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
essentially partisans who put loyalty to

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.330 
essentially partisans who put loyalty to
