00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
through briefly the third one just to

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.250 
through briefly the third one just to
see<00:00:38.579> what<00:00:38.880> the<00:00:39.030> hasty<00:00:39.360> transfers<00:00:39.810> like<00:00:39.989> and

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
see what the hasty transfers like and

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.810 
see what the hasty transfers like and
it's<00:00:40.650> actually<00:00:40.890> really<00:00:41.130> good<00:00:41.370> also<00:00:41.640> quite

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
it's actually really good also quite

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.030 
it's actually really good also quite
surprised<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.960> first<00:00:43.200> one<00:00:43.410> struggles<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:44.010> bit

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
surprised the first one struggles a bit

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.850 
surprised the first one struggles a bit
it's<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.400> bit<00:00:44.430> grainy<00:00:44.820> in<00:00:45.120> places<00:00:45.650> but<00:00:46.650> I'm

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
it's a bit grainy in places but I'm

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.110 
it's a bit grainy in places but I'm
guessing<00:00:47.010> because<00:00:47.310> it's<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.550> older<00:00:47.850> of<00:00:47.940> the

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
guessing because it's the older of the

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.990 
guessing because it's the older of the
three<00:00:48.450> films<00:00:48.920> it<00:00:49.920> may<00:00:50.070> struggle<00:00:50.310> a<00:00:50.550> bit<00:00:50.670> but

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
three films it may struggle a bit but

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.280 
three films it may struggle a bit but
it's<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.360> hasty<00:00:51.660> transfer<00:00:52.020> are<00:00:52.080> still

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.290 
it's the hasty transfer are still

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:53.480 
it's the hasty transfer are still
grading<00:00:52.620> still<00:00:52.860> tell<00:00:53.040> the<00:00:53.130> difference<00:00:53.460> from

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:53.490 
grading still tell the difference from

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.270 
grading still tell the difference from
standard<00:00:54.060> F<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.330> hi-def<00:00:54.720> so<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.860> all<00:00:56.040> three

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
standard F to hi-def so that all three

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.880 
standard F to hi-def so that all three
films<00:00:56.460> are<00:00:56.670> well<00:00:56.790> worth<00:00:56.970> checking<00:00:57.060> out

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890

reason<00:02:11.879> why<00:02:11.970> I've<00:02:12.659> almost<00:02:12.900> got<00:02:13.140> this<00:02:13.230> one

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:13.409 
reason why I've almost got this one

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:14.990 
reason why I've almost got this one
because<00:02:13.620> it<00:02:13.769> comes<00:02:14.010> as<00:02:14.189> a<00:02:14.220> complete<00:02:14.400> set<00:02:14.760> I<00:02:14.849> may

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
because it comes as a complete set I may

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.270 
because it comes as a complete set I may
as<00:02:15.120> well<00:02:15.239> get<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.599> hopefully<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:17.130> whole

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
as well get the hopefully the whole

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.100 
as well get the hopefully the whole
three<00:02:17.490> films<00:02:17.819> but<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.569> reason<00:02:18.780> why<00:02:18.840> I<00:02:18.900> didn't

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
three films but the reason why I didn't

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.990 
three films but the reason why I didn't
like<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:19.290> third<00:02:19.530> one<00:02:19.740> was<00:02:19.950> because<00:02:20.310> it<00:02:20.760> stars

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
like the third one was because it stars

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.780 
like the third one was because it stars

exactly<00:02:26.200> the<00:02:26.439> same<00:02:26.530> in<00:02:26.859> the<00:02:26.920> movie<00:02:27.189> but<00:02:27.790> his

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:27.909 
exactly the same in the movie but his

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:30.690 
exactly the same in the movie but his
voice<00:02:28.060> isn't<00:02:28.359> the<00:02:28.540> same<00:02:28.750> and<00:02:29.049> I<00:02:29.769> prefer<00:02:30.069> Peter

voice isn't the same and I prefer Peter
Weller<00:02:30.939> a<00:02:31.030> because<00:02:31.329> he<00:02:31.450> is<00:02:31.540> the<00:02:31.689> original<00:02:32.079> and

00:02:32.429 --> 00:02:32.439 
Weller a because he is the original and

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:34.500 
Weller a because he is the original and
I<00:02:32.590> obviously<00:02:33.310> love<00:02:33.640> the<00:02:33.670> first<00:02:34.000> film<00:02:34.239> you

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
I obviously love the first film you

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.479 
I obviously love the first film you
can't<00:02:34.900> beat<00:02:35.079> it<00:02:35.109> really<00:02:35.620> even<00:02:36.280> though<00:02:36.370> the

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
can't beat it really even though the

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.789 
can't beat it really even though the
second<00:02:36.790> one<00:02:36.909> is<00:02:37.030> still<00:02:37.209> good<00:02:37.510> I<00:02:37.750> think<00:02:38.620> the

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
second one is still good I think the

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:41.550 
second one is still good I think the
first<00:02:39.489> one<00:02:39.609> tops<00:02:40.000> them<00:02:40.180> all<00:02:40.239> really<00:02:40.540> but<00:02:41.319> yeah

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
first one tops them all really but yeah

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.710 
first one tops them all really but yeah
