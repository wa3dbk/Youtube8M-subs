00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.580
 still 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.590
 The therapy we use to help 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.690
 people with fear of flying are talking about 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.190
 virtual reality for what 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.219
 virtual reality the fact is that 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.469
 fear in the new turns into a reflex and 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:43.719
 man who suffers aerophobia 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:45.640
 diffuse herbs respond very weakly to 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:47.829
 logical arguments that is as soon as 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.929
 the brain recognizes that the situation is close to 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:51.879
 the situation of the plane that is similar to 

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:53.249
 the plane roars like the plane will be like 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:55.719
 the plane looks like an airplane 

00:00:53.249 --> 00:00:58.210
 automatically start the reflex scary 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:59.440
 and in order for this reflex to change 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.179
 on the other reflex a person should 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.100
 get used to this situation 

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:04.839
 avoided however he cannot afford this 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.460
 allow it because it's scary for 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.130
 order to break this vicious circle 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:12.280
 we have created a situation here in the office 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:15.149
 which is very similar to the situation 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.149
 this flight 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:34.800
 we need. 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.640
 price 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.359
 time hurts 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.660
 there is also a cross on 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.150
 has a vibration accordingly she is very 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:04.180
 clearly conveys movement to concrete 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:06.640
 plates of false expensive 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.009
 and the person feels and 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.890
 in their work, virtually all of those and account 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.460
 to a friend 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.460
 call 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.090
 one more plus of virtual reality 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:31.270
 is that we can 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.310
 work comprehended years 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.260
 where is it which influence the plane 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.060
 gradually dragon 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.879
 long to work our 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:43.200
 longing reaction many times over 

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:45.360
 friend repeat debriefing 3 you then 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.840
 just such a repetition leads with 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.269
 time to form a new reflex 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.080
 apply refbek fear panic on the river 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:53.080
 self control 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:04.519
 the absolute majority of people are 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:06.379
 paradox that I propose to pass 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:08.269
 their virtual reality classes 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:10.370
 speak about the following not but i 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:11.870
 I understand that I am not curing anywhere 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.060
 scary here in the plane I really 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:17.150
 scary paradox is that 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.250
 95 percent of my patients and hitting on 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.049
 virtual reality and and unexpectedly 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.090
 for themselves and cn it will be strong 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.770
 fear this strong fear like on the very 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.990
 not bad because it is here 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:30.020
 you have the opportunity to train and 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.610
 work out all those control skills 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.500
 our condition we teach on 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.090
 courses is a black situation when we 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.949
 recommend using virtual 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.470
 reality is if you completed the course 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:41.510
 have mastered all the necessary knowledge and 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.310
 skills of self-control but you can not believe 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.919
 that it all works in real flight 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.870
 and avoid and flax and behavior which 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:50.090
 so peculiar all mayors about bom not 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.410
 gives you to fly which 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.169
 absolutely necessary in order to 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.370
 cable faber you can come here 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:57.139
 sterile office environment 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.030
 work out your reaction see what 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:01.280
 all those techniques and knowledge that you 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.500
 got work that is easier for you and 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.479
 test your strength something you can 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.400
 make this flight another category 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:09.229
 people for whom virtual reality 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.780
 It will be very helpful these are the people who 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:13.669
 sure that the problem is not in them 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.830
 suspiciousness and suspicion not in 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:18.500
 genetics not in education not psycho 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:20.060
 in character and in an aircraft such category 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.940
 unfortunately there are a lot of people 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.830
 convince themselves that aviation is the source 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:27.410
 all evils and problems on earth problems 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:29.720
 absolutely not in them in aviation for what 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:31.610
 we recommend these people to use 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.110
 virtual reality is very simple 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.849
 if such a person comes on 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.310
 virtual reality with a high proportion 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:39.320
 probabilities and here at the office on earth 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:42.229
 nowhere can his body give out 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:44.240
 panic reaction which means no 

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:46.460
 there is no safety connection with aircraft 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.800
 because if a person understands that he is sitting 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:50.350
 in the office does not fly anywhere and at the same time it 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.660
 an organism 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:54.520
 increases the quickening of the heartbeat and 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:56.050
 muscle tension and sweating occur 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.850
 palm pride panic 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:59.950
 then it becomes obvious to man 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:01.690
 the problem is still not in the aircraft because 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:05.080
 that i'm on a plane from his personal psyche 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:08.130
 and with this understanding it is easier to accept 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:10.870
 the decision to start a course of treatment of phobias 

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:12.670
 luckily today there is a huge 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.220
 the number of tools with which 

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:16.900
 anyone with the fear of flying can 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:19.840
 once and for all get rid of this 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:22.740
 sores make a decision come 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.740
 it's your fear
