00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 hey people welcome to a renewed 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.639
 cd video today I'll show you my 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.040
 attitudes in black ops 3 we go 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.280
 here on options and then purely in the 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.949
 so i have control here 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:21.480
 of course, no, voluntarily reverse the mouse 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.980
 yes and mouse sensitivity to 5.5 the 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.570
 can make it as you want the 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.279
 Mouse certificate must be very important 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.960
 his coming out of the weather also now 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.269
 we have the most to graphic option 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.800
 real problems with apps job are not so 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.940
 I do not know if the 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.739
 should help or can 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:41.670
 this graphic I actually have here 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.760
 the videos just 50 hertz here 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.379
 Of course everything will be taken care of 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.640
 example repetition show yes would have 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.100
 but i can do it anyway 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.829
 so here everything is small except that 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.449
 here on sma so no longer looks too 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.079
 if it makes on without because you did not 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.329
 more fps 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.399
 this is simply no idea that it 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.170
 looks better for a graphic artist synonymous 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.040
 if shit looks like many times 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.750
 Settings and 120 fps limited and 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.159
 here still without now I say unto you 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.930
 a little trick like you 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:14.040
 really something else can fit out 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.860
 on so people if their nvidia graphics card 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.710
 then he goes to nvidia 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.840
 You just have to search for the system control 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.500
 no idea in the search function on 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.750
 best so after that she depends on it 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.280
 So a little bit so be 3d 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.159
 setting and then 3d setting 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.820
 manage 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.310
 then you will join in here 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.430
 program settings no black ops 2 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.720
 have thus add to it and searches 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.579
 the program massive animal on 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.799
 search 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:44.610
 then you have to steam the steam apps 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.430
 come 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.159
 the black ops 2 beta and the on the 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.780
 application on that makes you then is 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:56.490
 that here we are with me looks like this 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.979
 that afterwards you can do it all here 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.530
 like to set specific so eg 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.509
 here at the stroke population off 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.420
 it makes everything you can 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:09.330
 and at the anti aging makes that easy 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.340
 normal or what there is here 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.210
 texture quality on performance as well 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.330
 power 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:19.970
 just the worst thing about it 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:24.020
 just goes so is everything then yes 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.020
 then I would have to run better 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:38.400
 go here 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:42.510
 i hope you like them people was 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.340
 So a woman partly or scan a 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.700
 dismantling people and then it works 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:52.010
 also liquid hopefully so good luck 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.010
 play at and yes even in there
