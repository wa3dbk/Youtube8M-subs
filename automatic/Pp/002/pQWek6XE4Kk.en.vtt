00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:14.350
 after 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.660
 the self world is dexter how are you 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.750
 you today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.939
 mini mister is acute that saturday kate 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.440
 claude gect to find so I do not know 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:34.309
 not if it's feasible in co op 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.540
 but in any case we smile it's 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:37.190
 feasible so you place at the level of 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.870
 the white line and you'll see at 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.210
 people of the ballistic knives 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.309
 so obviously you have to shoot right in 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.290
 on the target that you're trying to 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:46.640
 you on your screen please 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.250
 so well at the white line 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.960
 and you shoot right in the middle of the 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.570
 press x on the piano 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.890
 the piano will start to play so that 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.719
 this is the first step 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.510
 the first step so well done the 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:00.680
 piano started playing it's good so 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.090
 ballistic poles are 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.940
 obligatory then you have you 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.990
 direct slowly or quickly as 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:11.060
 wanted quickly and surely to the 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.570
 manor you are going to go kill small 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.820
 ghosts 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.130
 so what's interesting is that 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.750
 this historical will give us go us 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.440
 allow to buy an asset at 10 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.810
 dollars so vain valves will give us 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.180
 an asset that we have to pay $ 10 which 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.159
 is quite interesting enough given 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.659
 that you can do the strategy for 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:31.960
 have one at all for free and 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.880
 chain in the same sleeve 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.860
 the strategy for finally the rules list 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.630
 to have a trump to 10 dollar so 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.060
 you come out of the mansion and you go 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.560
 go straight into the mansion without 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.299
 to venture into the labyrinth 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.250
 here and you will see what was 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:48.320
 quite amusing is that the ghost that 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.820
 we piss off all the time well he 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.259
 is playing the piano there I do not 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.540
 do not know if you see him there I'm going 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:54.500
 you will see it better but here is the 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.110
 ghost is playing the piano 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.240
 you go to the piano hold x for 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.399
 give a tip and you have like 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.530
 tip an asset at 10 dollars 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:04.640
 so bah suddenly I had my 7th to 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.259
 rate which was double stroke to the ribs and 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.420
 I hope you enjoyed this video
