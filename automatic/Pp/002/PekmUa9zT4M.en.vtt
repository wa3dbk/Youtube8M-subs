00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
matter how much grip the racetrack has

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.380 
matter how much grip the racetrack has
you<00:01:02.010> don't<00:01:02.340> have<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:02.789> in<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.000> tunnel<00:01:03.270> turn

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
you don't have it in the tunnel turn

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.299 
you don't have it in the tunnel turn
it's<00:01:03.629> not<00:01:03.840> wide<00:01:04.049> enough<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.769> have<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.070> go

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
it's not wide enough you have to go

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.620 
it's not wide enough you have to go
through<00:01:05.460> there<00:01:05.580> too<00:01:05.729> why<00:01:05.880> there's<00:01:06.210> no<00:01:06.330> choice

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
through there too why there's no choice

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.170 
through there too why there's no choice
but<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:07.380> just<00:01:07.770> almost<00:01:08.040> never<00:01:08.580> works

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
but it just almost never works

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.120 
but it just almost never works

Jeff that angle he approached the tunnel

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.760 
Jeff that angle he approached the tunnel
with<00:01:25.300> it's<00:01:25.510> gonna<00:01:25.630> make<00:01:25.870> it<00:01:25.900> hard<00:01:26.170> to<00:01:26.260> turn<00:01:26.380> but

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
with it's gonna make it hard to turn but

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.770

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
aerodynamically that's a tough pass to

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.100 
aerodynamically that's a tough pass to
make<00:01:33.400> whether<00:01:33.910> the<00:01:34.090> pavement<00:01:34.450> is<00:01:34.540> or<00:01:34.690> new<00:01:35.080> or
