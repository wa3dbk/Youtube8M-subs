it could be

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.870 
it could be
feet<00:02:15.630> away<00:02:15.750> could<00:02:16.110> be<00:02:16.140> 20<00:02:16.680> feet<00:02:16.890> away<00:02:17.010> but<00:02:17.340> on

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
feet away could be 20 feet away but on

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.830 
feet away could be 20 feet away but on
the<00:02:18.270> ground<00:02:18.930> it<00:02:19.650> will<00:02:20.490> now<00:02:20.850> seep<00:02:21.300> into<00:02:21.570> the

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
the ground it will now seep into the

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.630 
the ground it will now seep into the
ground<00:02:22.080> down<00:02:22.350> in<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.590> hard<00:02:22.770> pan<00:02:23.040> and<00:02:23.280> run

ground down in the hard pan and run
towards<00:02:24.120> your<00:02:24.330> house<00:02:24.570> and<00:02:24.900> if<00:02:25.650> that's<00:02:25.770> the

in the window well no matter what so you
definitely<00:02:29.640> want<00:02:30.270> to<00:02:30.390> have<00:02:30.510> drainage<00:02:31.230> in<00:02:31.680> the

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
definitely want to have drainage in the

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.830 
definitely want to have drainage in the
bottom<00:02:32.340> of<00:02:32.460> the<00:02:32.520> window<00:02:32.790> well<00:02:32.940> and<00:02:33.180> I<00:02:33.600> always

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
bottom of the window well and I always

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.750 
bottom of the window well and I always
like<00:02:34.200> to<00:02:34.230> relate<00:02:34.680> to<00:02:34.710> if<00:02:35.160> you're<00:02:35.280> going<00:02:35.430> to<00:02:35.580> put

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
like to relate to if you're going to put

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.020 
like to relate to if you're going to put
drainage<00:02:36.740> properly<00:02:37.740> into<00:02:38.250> a<00:02:38.280> window<00:02:38.610> well<00:02:38.730> do

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
drainage properly into a window well do

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.540 
drainage properly into a window well do
it<00:02:39.240> right<00:02:39.840> and<00:02:40.050> do<00:02:40.620> it<00:02:40.650> twice

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
it right and do it twice

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.060 
it right and do it twice
you<00:02:41.700> want<00:02:41.880> two<00:02:42.120> drains<00:02:42.450> in<00:02:42.720> each<00:02:43.350> window<00:02:43.740> well

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
you want two drains in each window well

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.940 
you want two drains in each window well
and<00:02:44.340> this<00:02:45.209> is<00:02:45.270> how<00:02:45.570> you<00:02:45.630> go<00:02:45.870> about<00:02:45.959> it<00:02:46.140> using

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
and this is how you go about it using

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.199 
and this is how you go about it using
for<00:02:47.400> example<00:02:48.000> if<00:02:48.840> you<00:02:49.110> have<00:02:49.470> a<00:02:49.820> like<00:02:50.820> a<00:02:50.850> power

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
for example if you have a like a power

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.630 
for example if you have a like a power
auger<00:02:51.930> then<00:02:52.560> it's<00:02:52.770> very<00:02:53.040> simple<00:02:53.459> and<00:02:53.550> the

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
auger then it's very simple and the

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.990 
auger then it's very simple and the
power<00:02:53.820> auger<00:02:54.150> will<00:02:54.570> work<00:02:55.310> the<00:02:56.310> main<00:02:56.459> thing<00:02:56.760> is

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
power auger will work the main thing is

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.940 
power auger will work the main thing is
that<00:02:57.030> using<00:02:57.780> a<00:02:58.020> power<00:02:58.200> auger<00:02:58.500> you<00:02:58.770> need

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
that using a power auger you need

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.520 
that using a power auger you need
definitely<00:02:59.280> two<00:02:59.670> people<00:03:00.060> in<00:03:00.209> place<00:03:00.480> it's<00:03:01.320> like

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
definitely two people in place it's like

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.280 
definitely two people in place it's like
drilling<00:03:01.860> a<00:03:02.010> post<00:03:02.280> hole<00:03:02.489> and<00:03:02.840> that<00:03:03.840> drilling<00:03:04.260> a

of<00:03:26.519> the<00:03:27.030> width<00:03:27.239> of<00:03:27.480> your<00:03:27.510> window<00:03:27.720> well<00:03:28.470> that

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
of the width of your window well that

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.940 
of the width of your window well that
way<00:03:29.430> you<00:03:30.060> can<00:03:30.269> drill<00:03:30.570> down<00:03:30.840> to<00:03:31.170> where<00:03:31.650> your

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
way you can drill down to where your

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.270 
way you can drill down to where your
perimeter<00:03:32.430> drainages<00:03:33.150> are<00:03:33.660> and<00:03:34.200> that<00:03:34.830> can<00:03:35.130> be

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
perimeter drainages are and that can be

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.250 
perimeter drainages are and that can be
measured<00:03:35.790> by<00:03:36.239> means<00:03:36.540> of<00:03:36.840> taking<00:03:37.049> a

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
measurement inside the home because you

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:40.759 
measurement inside the home because you
know<00:03:39.239> right<00:03:39.630> outside<00:03:40.019> where<00:03:40.320> your<00:03:40.440> floor

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
know right outside where your floor

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.220 
know right outside where your floor
level<00:03:41.489> is<00:03:41.640> right<00:03:42.090> outside<00:03:42.239> them<00:03:42.660> your<00:03:42.840> footing

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
level is right outside them your footing

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.140 
level is right outside them your footing
and<00:03:43.410> your<00:03:43.680> primitive<00:03:43.890> drainage<00:03:44.340> so<00:03:44.519> you<00:03:44.970> don't

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
and your primitive drainage so you don't

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.240 
and your primitive drainage so you don't
want<00:03:45.269> to<00:03:45.360> go<00:03:45.480> any<00:03:45.830> deeper<00:03:46.830> than<00:03:47.220> that

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
want to go any deeper than that

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.560 
want to go any deeper than that
obviously<00:03:47.760> don't<00:03:47.970> want<00:03:48.090> to<00:03:48.150> get<00:03:48.269> into<00:03:48.480> the

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
obviously don't want to get into the

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.870 
obviously don't want to get into the
perimeter<00:03:48.900> drainage<00:03:49.200> because<00:03:49.350> it<00:03:49.620> may<00:03:49.769> be<00:03:49.880> the

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
perimeter drainage because it may be the

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.449 
perimeter drainage because it may be the
black<00:03:51.239> plastic<00:03:51.780> drainage<00:03:52.620> pipe<00:03:52.830> rather<00:03:53.160> than

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
black plastic drainage pipe rather than

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.080 
black plastic drainage pipe rather than
the<00:03:53.580> PVC<00:03:54.150> or<00:03:54.390> the<00:03:55.110> old<00:03:55.560> tile<00:03:55.830> being<00:03:56.730> the<00:03:56.880> clay

the PVC or the old tile being the clay

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.199 
the PVC or the old tile being the clay
type<00:03:57.299> so<00:03:57.870> drilling<00:03:58.739> a<00:03:59.040> hole<00:03:59.070> or<00:03:59.610> you<00:04:00.030> can

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
type so drilling a hole or you can

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.990 
type so drilling a hole or you can
actually<00:04:00.660> use<00:04:00.840> the<00:04:01.170> the<00:04:01.709> post<00:04:02.400> hole<00:04:02.610> to<00:04:02.760> hand

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
actually use the the post hole to hand

for that when you put it down into the
six<00:04:27.660> hole<00:04:28.160> then<00:04:29.160> you

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
six hole then you

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.820 
six hole then you
want<00:04:29.460> to<00:04:29.520> take<00:04:29.700> some<00:04:29.970> gravel<00:04:30.780> like<00:04:31.260> some<00:04:31.560> good

4-inch perforated PVC pipe down in it

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.840 
4-inch perforated PVC pipe down in it
all<00:04:39.360> if<00:04:39.600> you<00:04:39.870> can<00:04:40.470> use<00:04:40.620> Big<00:04:40.890> O<00:04:41.010> as<00:04:41.250> well<00:04:41.490> as<00:04:41.640> long

all if you can use Big O as well as long

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.610 
all if you can use Big O as well as long
as<00:04:41.940> it's<00:04:42.120> perforated<00:04:42.450> I<00:04:42.870> think<00:04:43.350> you'll<00:04:43.440> find

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
as it's perforated I think you'll find

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:44.900 
as it's perforated I think you'll find
that<00:04:43.860> PVC<00:04:44.130> will<00:04:44.370> go<00:04:44.520> down<00:04:44.670> much<00:04:44.850> easier

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
that PVC will go down much easier

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.570 
that PVC will go down much easier
because<00:04:45.510> it<00:04:45.660> is<00:04:45.780> straight<00:04:46.050> and<00:04:46.290> it<00:04:46.380> is<00:04:46.580> rigid

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
because it is straight and it is rigid

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.820 
because it is straight and it is rigid
so<00:04:48.210> down<00:04:48.630> the<00:04:48.810> hole<00:04:48.930> you<00:04:49.020> go<00:04:49.170> and<00:04:49.380> then<00:04:49.470> put<00:04:49.710> the

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
so down the hole you go and then put the

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.980 
so down the hole you go and then put the
drain<00:04:50.040> rock<00:04:50.340> around<00:04:50.580> it<00:04:51.270> some<00:04:51.510> people<00:04:51.810> will

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
drain rock around it some people will

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.410 
drain rock around it some people will
even<00:04:52.230> fill<00:04:52.800> that<00:04:53.490> the<00:04:53.700> pipe<00:04:53.880> of<00:04:54.060> drain<00:04:54.240> rock

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:54.420 
even fill that the pipe of drain rock

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.410 
even fill that the pipe of drain rock
which<00:04:54.660> I<00:04:54.930> do<00:04:54.990> just<00:04:55.710> for<00:04:55.920> your<00:04:56.070> information<00:04:56.790> and

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:57.420 
which I do just for your information and

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.210 
which I do just for your information and
because<00:04:57.960> the<00:04:58.080> water<00:04:58.260> will<00:04:58.500> drain<00:04:58.530> around<00:04:59.040> it

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
because the water will drain around it

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.790 
because the water will drain around it
then<00:04:59.370> at<00:04:59.490> the<00:04:59.640> top<00:04:59.940> you<00:05:00.390> put<00:05:00.960> a<00:05:00.990> drain<00:05:01.350> plate

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
then at the top you put a drain plate

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.590 
then at the top you put a drain plate
and<00:05:02.040> the<00:05:02.400> drain<00:05:02.610> plates<00:05:02.880> are<00:05:03.030> available<00:05:03.450> for

and the drain plates are available for
the<00:05:03.720> PVC<00:05:04.230> and<00:05:04.410> you<00:05:05.280> put<00:05:05.610> the<00:05:05.790> bell<00:05:06.210> in<00:05:06.480> the<00:05:06.900> bell

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:07.140 
the PVC and you put the bell in the bell

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.770 
the PVC and you put the bell in the bell
end<00:05:07.620> is<00:05:07.830> where<00:05:08.130> the<00:05:08.430> the<00:05:09.090> female<00:05:09.420> and<00:05:09.570> the<00:05:09.630> male
