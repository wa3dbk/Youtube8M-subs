class and he said this is a rendition of
what<00:01:51.720> he<00:01:51.869> thinks<00:01:52.259> is<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.409> Monet<00:01:52.890> maybe

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
what he thinks is a Monet maybe

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.429 
what he thinks is a Monet maybe
impressionistic<00:01:54.060> style<00:01:54.299> but<00:01:55.079> he<00:01:55.140> said<00:01:55.320> this

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
impressionistic style but he said this

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.469 
impressionistic style but he said this
is<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.680> building<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:56.219> some<00:01:56.250> sort<00:01:56.700> this<00:01:57.149> is<00:01:57.329> the

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
is a building of some sort this is the

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.999 
is a building of some sort this is the
sky<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.780> water<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:58.560> I<00:01:58.619> just<00:01:58.740> thought<00:01:58.829> this

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
sky the water and I just thought this

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.130 
sky the water and I just thought this
would<00:01:59.159> be<00:01:59.189> perfect<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.820> depict<00:02:00.240> exactly<00:02:01.020> what

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
would be perfect to depict exactly what

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.899 
would be perfect to depict exactly what
I<00:02:01.170> wanted<00:02:01.649> but<00:02:01.829> it<00:02:02.130> also<00:02:02.280> lets<00:02:02.610> me<00:02:02.700> have

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
I wanted but it also lets me have

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.300 
I wanted but it also lets me have
Joseph's<00:02:03.390> artwork<00:02:03.840> in<00:02:03.960> here<00:02:04.110> so<00:02:04.350> I'm<00:02:05.130> going<00:02:05.280> to

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
scripture that I just printed onto some

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.420 
scripture that I just printed onto some
copy<00:02:08.759> paper<00:02:09.060> through<00:02:09.420> my<00:02:09.539> printer<00:02:09.899> or<00:02:10.709> not<00:02:11.129> the

this<00:02:14.820> this<00:02:15.150> was<00:02:15.360> my<00:02:15.480> idea<00:02:15.660> I<00:02:15.840> thought<00:02:16.110> this

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
this this was my idea I thought this

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.720 
this this was my idea I thought this
would<00:02:16.350> be<00:02:16.410> kind<00:02:16.620> of<00:02:16.650> cute<00:02:16.800> you<00:02:16.920> know<00:02:16.950> I<00:02:17.370> don't

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
would be kind of cute you know I don't

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
would be kind of cute you know I don't
know<00:02:17.820> if<00:02:17.880> you've<00:02:18.000> ever<00:02:18.060> been<00:02:18.180> to<00:02:18.330> one<00:02:18.600> of<00:02:18.690> the

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
know if you've ever been to one of the

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.150 
know if you've ever been to one of the
kids<00:02:18.960> art<00:02:19.200> shows<00:02:19.440> at<00:02:19.620> school<00:02:19.830> or<00:02:19.980> anything

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
kids art shows at school or anything

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.770 
kids art shows at school or anything
like<00:02:20.280> that<00:02:20.430> they<00:02:21.000> typically<00:02:21.480> have<00:02:21.510> this

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
like that they typically have this

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.690 
like that they typically have this
little<00:02:21.900> white<00:02:22.200> card<00:02:22.530> in<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.770> corner<00:02:23.190> that

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
little white card in the corner that

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.430 
little white card in the corner that
tells<00:02:24.000> you<00:02:24.180> who<00:02:24.420> did<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:24.750> painting<00:02:25.020> and<00:02:25.320> that

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
tells you who did the painting and that

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.020 
tells you who did the painting and that
sort<00:02:25.680> of<00:02:25.740> thing<00:02:25.800> and<00:02:26.190> I<00:02:26.490> thought<00:02:26.670> it<00:02:26.790> would<00:02:26.910> be

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
sort of thing and I thought it would be

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.080 
sort of thing and I thought it would be
cute<00:02:27.450> to<00:02:27.870> do<00:02:28.560> this<00:02:28.710> little<00:02:28.890> white<00:02:29.190> paper<00:02:29.640> and

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
cute to do this little white paper and

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.960 
cute to do this little white paper and
make<00:02:30.420> it<00:02:30.570> look<00:02:30.840> like<00:02:31.110> that<00:02:31.500> name<00:02:32.280> plaque<00:02:32.700> or

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
make it look like that name plaque or

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.400 
make it look like that name plaque or
whatever<00:02:33.240> it<00:02:33.360> is<00:02:33.480> that<00:02:33.630> they<00:02:33.750> put<00:02:33.990> on<00:02:34.170> them

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
whatever it is that they put on them

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.710 
whatever it is that they put on them
I've<00:02:35.070> been<00:02:35.280> to<00:02:35.370> some<00:02:35.490> art<00:02:35.760> shows<00:02:36.030> at<00:02:36.330> my<00:02:36.450> kids

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
I've been to some art shows at my kids

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.180 
I've been to some art shows at my kids
school<00:02:36.810> where<00:02:37.170> they've<00:02:37.320> done<00:02:37.500> some<00:02:37.710> art<00:02:37.980> and

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
school where they've done some art and

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.010 
school where they've done some art and
they've<00:02:38.700> always<00:02:38.850> had<00:02:39.060> a<00:02:39.120> little<00:02:39.390> white<00:02:39.810> little

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
they've always had a little white little

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.450 
they've always had a little white little
plaque<00:02:40.350> in<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:40.620> corner<00:02:40.890> telling<00:02:41.160> their<00:02:41.280> name

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
plaque in the corner telling their name

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:42.860 
plaque in the corner telling their name
and<00:02:41.700> their<00:02:41.850> grade<00:02:42.090> and<00:02:42.390> that<00:02:42.510> sort<00:02:42.750> of<00:02:42.780> thing

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
and their grade and that sort of thing

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.930 
and their grade and that sort of thing
so<00:02:43.680> this<00:02:43.830> is<00:02:43.980> going<00:02:44.070> to<00:02:44.160> be<00:02:44.250> reminiscent<00:02:44.820> of

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
so this is going to be reminiscent of

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.190 
so this is going to be reminiscent of
that<00:02:45.270> and<00:02:46.910> typically<00:02:47.910> these<00:02:48.420> guys<00:02:48.750> are<00:02:49.020> liking

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
that and typically these guys are liking

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.720 
that and typically these guys are liking
this<00:02:49.470> for<00:02:49.710> a<00:02:49.740> corner<00:02:50.070> but<00:02:50.220> I'm<00:02:50.340> not<00:02:50.520> covering

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
this for a corner but I'm not covering

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.430 
this for a corner but I'm not covering
up<00:02:50.940> his<00:02:51.120> little<00:02:51.390> initial<00:02:51.900> or<00:02:52.080> his<00:02:52.200> little

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
signature I love it now this will also

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.570 
signature I love it now this will also
be<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:55.050> first<00:02:55.350> page<00:02:55.590> in<00:02:55.740> my<00:02:55.860> book<00:02:56.070> that<00:02:56.250> I<00:02:56.280> put

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
be the first page in my book that I put

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.630 
be the first page in my book that I put
in<00:02:56.730> a<00:02:56.850> tan<00:02:57.030> in<00:02:57.690> a<00:02:57.900> landscape<00:02:58.470> way<00:02:59.100> I've<00:02:59.430> never

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
in a tan in a landscape way I've never

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.820 
in a tan in a landscape way I've never
done<00:02:59.850> that<00:03:00.030> before<00:03:00.180> so<00:03:00.570> this<00:03:01.080> will<00:03:01.110> be<00:03:01.320> new<00:03:01.530> and

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
done that before so this will be new and
