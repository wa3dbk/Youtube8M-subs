00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:12.450
 hello since nice shared of the 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.629
 side as here we are going to start from the side 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.629
 left 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.670
 of the first part of the front to the 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.360
 ear let's take it from both sides 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.360
 hair 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.550
 They can moisten or put a little gel 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:43.650
 or if you prefer it with dry hair 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.650
 as you prefer the texture of the hairstyle 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:02.880
 here I finished taking both sides 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.440
 and from here to bring the 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.250
 braids on the right side I'm going to 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.250
 take from above 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.380
 we are doing two trade that is the 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.950
 inverted braid so that it stays with 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.950
 texture 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.659
 the hair here will take all the 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:58.460
 sections that need 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.460
 usually brush here 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:07.259
 and trachea try to tighten a little more 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:09.649
 so that the front of the 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.649
 braid 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.350
 ok here I already took the last piece that goes 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.820
 next to the ear and now we're going to 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.820
 start again the return 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.060
 and we are going to take again just from 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.060
 above 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.410
 in the previous video that we have of baby 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.240
 break here would end the hairstyle with a 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.610
 braid to the point but right now we're going 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.630
 to finish making another curve for 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.630
 end up in a chongo 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.310
 contrary to this curve and this one 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.110
 the last one we're going to take hair alone from 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.780
 down no longer from here now from below 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:13.430
 then in this round they will start 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.430
 take hair from the bottom 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.120
 I'm going to say I 'm lame 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:01.750
 here I'm going to take my last piece 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.110
 and we will continue braids 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.110
 final 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.930
 we put an elastic and here they can 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.850
 leave the braid like this or they can 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:21.150
 loosen up a bit if they think they are not going to 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:23.370
 lose a lot of hair like here I 'm going to 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.120
 pull just a little up to give 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.120
 more texture 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.370
 and what we 're going to do is screw the 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:31.370
 final 

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:41.209
 to achieve a lot here and they can place 

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:41.209
 the number of pins that need 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:48.889
 remember to use pins of the same 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:48.889
 hair color 

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:06.529
 we have the braid option 3 of the 

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:08.579
 web and brett is a very nice option 

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:10.849
 for those who do not want to have hair 

00:05:08.579 --> 00:05:15.199
 loose or they have left aside a queue 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:15.199
 Enjoy it and see you next time 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:28.180
