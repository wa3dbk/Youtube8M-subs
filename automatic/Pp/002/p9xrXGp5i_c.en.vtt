I<00:00:53.820> might<00:00:54.360> make<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.570> quick<00:00:54.899> adjustment<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.559> my

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
I might make a quick adjustment to my

I might make a quick adjustment to my
ISO<00:00:56.219> on<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.550> camera<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.390> know<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:57.539> got<00:00:57.719> a

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
ISO on the camera you know you got a

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.240 
ISO on the camera you know you got a
couple<00:00:57.960> ways<00:00:58.199> you<00:00:58.230> can<00:00:58.379> control<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.920> exposure

you<00:00:59.520> can<00:00:59.640> have<00:00:59.760> your<00:00:59.910> assistant<00:01:00.329> back<00:01:00.480> up<00:01:00.719> or

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
you can have your assistant back up or

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.720 
you can have your assistant back up or
move<00:01:01.199> forward<00:01:01.590> you<00:01:01.739> can<00:01:01.859> also<00:01:02.010> change

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
move forward you can also change

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.759 
move forward you can also change
aperture<00:01:03.270> you<00:01:03.570> can<00:01:03.600> also<00:01:03.840> change<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.350> ISO

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
aperture you can also change the ISO

the<00:05:29.700> earlier<00:05:29.970> section<00:05:30.300> you've<00:05:31.080> got<00:05:31.230> a<00:05:31.260> very

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
the earlier section you've got a very

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.990 
the earlier section you've got a very
small<00:05:31.590> light<00:05:31.980> source<00:05:32.250> right<00:05:32.460> here<00:05:32.520> and<00:05:32.880> this

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
small light source right here and this

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.490 
small light source right here and this
little<00:05:33.120> small<00:05:33.420> light<00:05:33.600> source<00:05:33.870> I<00:05:34.080> got<00:05:34.350> this

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
little small light source I got this

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.020 
little small light source I got this
down<00:05:34.710> here<00:05:34.920> but<00:05:35.100> write<00:05:35.520> it<00:05:35.640> off<00:05:35.760> the<00:05:35.880> thing

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
down here but write it off the thing

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:37.700 
down here but write it off the thing
anyway<00:05:36.330> we're<00:05:36.480> fine<00:05:36.720> but<00:05:37.230> the<00:05:37.320> small<00:05:37.560> light

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
anyway we're fine but the small light

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.710 
anyway we're fine but the small light
source<00:05:37.950> can't<00:05:38.340> introduce<00:05:38.610> specularity<00:05:39.300> into

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 
source can't introduce specularity into

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.900 
source can't introduce specularity into
the<00:05:39.840> shadows<00:05:40.230> so<00:05:40.260> be<00:05:40.620> careful<00:05:41.010> about<00:05:41.160> that<00:05:41.220> you

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:41.910 
the shadows so be careful about that you

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:44.060 
the shadows so be careful about that you
know<00:05:42.000> we<00:05:42.150> got<00:05:42.300> yeah<00:05:43.170> it's<00:05:43.380> a<00:05:43.470> high<00:05:43.680> ceiling

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070 
know we got yeah it's a high ceiling

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.550 
know we got yeah it's a high ceiling
here<00:05:44.520> but<00:05:44.700> you<00:05:45.120> know<00:05:45.210> what<00:05:45.420> I<00:05:45.630> might<00:05:45.960> even<00:05:46.170> feel

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 
here but you know what I might even feel

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.530 
here but you know what I might even feel
by<00:05:46.740> using<00:05:46.920> my<00:05:47.130> off<00:05:47.310> key<00:05:47.550> my<00:05:47.730> on<00:05:47.910> camera<00:05:48.270> flash

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:48.540 
by using my off key my on camera flash

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.510 
by using my off key my on camera flash
and<00:05:48.720> imbalancing<00:05:49.530> off<00:05:49.650> the<00:05:49.770> ceiling<00:05:50.190> if<00:05:50.340> that

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 
and imbalancing off the ceiling if that

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.340 
and imbalancing off the ceiling if that
ceiling<00:05:50.940> is<00:05:50.970> low<00:05:51.300> enough<00:05:51.600> to<00:05:51.780> be<00:05:51.870> able<00:05:51.960> to<00:05:52.140> do

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:52.350 
ceiling is low enough to be able to do

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:54.110 
ceiling is low enough to be able to do
that<00:05:52.560> so<00:05:53.220> anyway<00:05:53.520> that's<00:05:53.640> kind<00:05:53.760> of<00:05:53.910> what<00:05:54.030> we're

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 
that so anyway that's kind of what we're

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.110 
that so anyway that's kind of what we're
trying<00:05:54.270> to<00:05:54.390> show<00:05:54.600> right<00:05:54.780> here
