00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:14.630
 Hello, today we will do 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.730
 workout shoulders 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:19.340
 Today it will be hard toning as 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.060
 recently and competitions and accordingly 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:27.789
 I want to take this moment as 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:33.690
 Pamping as muscle pump start 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:39.899
 with such forests to make 1 12 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.899
 exercise bench dumbbell sitting 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.070
 Barbie 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.040
 There are several types of doing this. 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.750
 exercises with big yourself with little ones 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.949
 while I will talk about the little ones 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:58.739
 the point is to stretch the muscle as much as possible 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:01.860
 lower to shoulder to lift as much as possible 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.409
 up lower shoulder down to hurt 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.940
 maximum century is also allowed 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.380
 various variations of this exercise 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:15.509
 such as either a breeding 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:18.119
 next with big down weights 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:21.149
 not very positive as it is 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.840
 affects shoulder joints 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:23.840
 negative side 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:38.230
 this exercise is considered basic 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.900
 one of the base 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:44.380
 as it develops very well exactly 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:46.060
 muscle volume and got to what approach we 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.330
 take take advantage of more jungle 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.300
 myself 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.590
 and also recommend using such things 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.790
 like wiki brushes 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:57.580
 it's a kind of safety measure of your 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:01.180
 forearm brushes from damage 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:04.330
 different genera but in particular that's when 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:07.150
 twisted sleeve strongly here can 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.660
 injured tendon I already passed 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.220
 subs that way therefore big weights 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.590
 everywhere there is the possibility of inverting 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.040
 brushes i always use things like 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.040
 and steaks 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.570
 of course 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:31.200
 in this one I will not use incomplete 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:31.200
 amplitude with more less 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.459
 he 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.310
 magnets 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.670
 people to turned 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.739
 tears season more as for 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.230
 amplitudes of several many different techniques 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.730
 many different nuances a lot of controversy 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.560
 each coach his views on this 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:02.379
 score but as shown by western 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:05.620
 bodybuilder american particular such 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:06.810
 technique has a very good plus that is 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.150
 you make 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.650
 work short muscle fibers 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:15.099
 which is responsible for endurance a 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.870
 it is the volume that's so small 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:19.359
 amplitude it can in principle be 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.900
 used in all exercises for all 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:22.510
 muscle groups 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.840
 well, for almost all of you, it is peace and concerns 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:28.959
 such base where big weights due to 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.239
 it is like there is an opportunity to move 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:34.769
 dead center cost which is often 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:34.769
 pursues all athletes 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.620
 Yes 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.640
 but it would be harder 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.440
 vs 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.440
 simply 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.020
 he 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:57.409
 Th at was interesting there are several 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:02.689
 types of errors that most often 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:04.569
 allow the athlete to show a couple how 

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:08.420
 no need to do 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:12.170
 when the last one are you trying to 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:14.629
 survive and it turns out like this exactly barks 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:17.780
 and here it is not necessary to do it in the first place 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:19.459
 grass is dangerous in the second you do not want 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.799
 so that you have different hands or different 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:25.160
 shoulders 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:29.050
 there is still a nuance with a bench angle 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:30.470
 the shop changes the load that is when 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:35.050
 as smooth as possible 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:39.259
 you goes the average bunch the more you 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:41.449
 lean over the bench here the more 

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:44.270
 front beam works 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:46.729
 it also makes sense but lower below 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.470
 than 40 degrees and recommend as it is 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:52.460
 there will be no shoulder training 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:55.180
 and chest training is up to 45 degrees 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:58.910
 this is the maximum that can be omitted 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.770
 again with 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:03.740
 performing these exercises lived under 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:08.780
 this angle you need to keep 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:09.580
 k and those very rules jim should 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.570
 take place 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.690
 elbows should be set apart 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:17.300
 not like this otherwise it will swing 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:23.840
 triceps like this when it will swing 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:27.440
 shoulders there are various techniques it is possible 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.890
 swing reducing to the end that's hysterical to me 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:32.000
 now 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:34.240
 that is, you can do it like this 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.240
 So 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:41.660
 it all has its pros and cons 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:42.140
 I personally recommend everyone to have 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.940
 arsenal 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:46.910
 as many different 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:51.230
 exercises and you can change them more often 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:52.790
 have a slope and forest angles sequence 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:56.090
 exercise even if that is basic 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:56.690
 exercise it can be done third 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:59.720
 fourth 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:02.360
 Naturally lighter but she 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.590
 differently quite calling you also 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.740
 accordingly there is an isolated 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:10.160
 exercise on the muscles that I usually do 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:12.530
 at the end of them you can start and even this 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:16.690
 rearrangement backwards exercises 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:16.690
 You can achieve a very interesting effect.
