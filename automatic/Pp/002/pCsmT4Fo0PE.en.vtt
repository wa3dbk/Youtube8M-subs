00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
to it it doesn't like kind of just smear

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:07.170

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
to get it to be as natural as possible

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.780

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
or whatever now this is the step that I

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.830 
or whatever now this is the step that I
think<00:04:11.709> is<00:04:11.859> so<00:04:12.190> so<00:04:12.519> important<00:04:12.970> now<00:04:13.150> this<00:04:13.540> can<00:04:13.750> be

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
think is so so important now this can be

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.650 
think is so so important now this can be
either<00:04:13.959> done<00:04:14.260> with<00:04:14.980> your<00:04:15.430> setting<00:04:16.030> spray<00:04:16.329> or<00:04:16.600> a

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.460 
and when you use a setting spray or fix+
and<00:06:02.370> just<00:06:02.880> really<00:06:03.180> push<00:06:03.600> it<00:06:03.630> in<00:06:03.960> it<00:06:04.230> kind<00:06:04.380> of

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:04.470 
and just really push it in it kind of

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.050 
and just really push it in it kind of
makes<00:06:04.740> your<00:06:04.920> skin<00:06:05.040> look<00:06:05.250> a<00:06:05.340> lot<00:06:05.580> smoother

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:06.060 
makes your skin look a lot smoother

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.150 
makes your skin look a lot smoother
because<00:06:06.570> if<00:06:06.930> you<00:06:07.110> first<00:06:07.470> spray<00:06:07.740> on<00:06:07.890> it<00:06:07.920> you're

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.160 
because if you first spray on it you're

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.440 
because if you first spray on it you're
gonna<00:06:08.220> see<00:06:08.340> all<00:06:08.670> those<00:06:08.790> little<00:06:09.060> baby<00:06:09.210> hairs

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:09.450 
gonna see all those little baby hairs

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:11.450 
gonna see all those little baby hairs
but<00:06:10.020> they're<00:06:10.170> gonna<00:06:10.290> really<00:06:10.620> stick<00:06:11.070> to<00:06:11.310> your

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:11.460 
but they're gonna really stick to your

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.880 
but they're gonna really stick to your
skin<00:06:11.820> once<00:06:12.450> you<00:06:12.690> use<00:06:12.960> the<00:06:13.350> Beauty<00:06:13.560> Blender<00:06:13.860> to

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:13.890 
skin once you use the Beauty Blender to

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:16.670 
skin once you use the Beauty Blender to
press<00:06:14.160> them<00:06:14.340> in<00:06:14.550> because<00:06:14.880> fix+<00:06:15.360> you<00:06:15.630> acts<00:06:15.930> like

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:16.680 
press them in because fix+ you acts like

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.770 
press them in because fix+ you acts like
the<00:06:16.800> finishing<00:06:17.340> sealant<00:06:17.790> I<00:06:17.970> usually<00:06:18.450> do<00:06:18.600> this
