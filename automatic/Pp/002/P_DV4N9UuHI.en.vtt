00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
so I got the first idea first one going

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.789 
so I got the first idea first one going
here<00:01:15.180> with<00:01:15.869> just<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.290> normal<00:01:17.090> put<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.240> hinge

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
here with just the normal put the hinge

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:24.289 
here with just the normal put the hinge
idea<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.909> peg<00:01:21.150> as<00:01:21.530> maiya<00:01:23.299> friction

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
idea and the peg as maiya friction

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.570 
idea and the peg as maiya friction
they'll<00:01:25.259> save<00:01:25.530> this<00:01:25.710> other<00:01:25.890> motor<00:01:26.159> made<00:01:26.400> up

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
they'll save this other motor made up

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.880 
they'll save this other motor made up
here<00:01:26.759> in<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:26.939> garage<00:01:27.829> I<00:01:30.680> kind<00:01:31.680> of<00:01:31.710> thought

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
here in the garage I kind of thought

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.920 
here in the garage I kind of thought
that<00:01:31.950> we<00:01:32.909> could<00:01:32.939> do<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.240> little<00:01:33.479> something<00:01:33.810> like

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
that we could do a little something like

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.810 
that we could do a little something like
that<00:01:34.670> tighten<00:01:35.670> up<00:01:35.729> this<00:01:35.939> arm<00:01:36.240> here<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:37.820> then

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
that tighten up this arm here and then

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.270 
that tighten up this arm here and then
just<00:01:39.720> pivot<00:01:40.110> off<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.409> bat<00:01:40.619> one<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:43.280> another

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
just pivot off the bat one to another

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.450 
just pivot off the bat one to another
thought<00:01:44.579> is<00:01:44.610> this<00:01:44.970> is<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:46.009> kind<00:01:47.009> of<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.189> slower

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
thought is this is a kind of a slower

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.719 
thought is this is a kind of a slower
torque<00:01:47.850> your<00:01:47.909> motor<00:01:48.390> then<00:01:49.350> what<00:01:50.070> this<00:01:50.280> is<00:01:50.520> I've

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
torque your motor then what this is I've

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.380 
torque your motor then what this is I've
run<00:01:50.909> them<00:01:51.030> bolt<00:01:52.579> another<00:01:53.579> thought<00:01:53.820> is<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:54.180> put

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
run them bolt another thought is to put

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.959 
run them bolt another thought is to put
this<00:01:54.540> one<00:01:54.780> on<00:01:54.810> on<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.409> back<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.979> then<00:01:56.820> you

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
this one on on the back and then you

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.719 
this one on on the back and then you
want<00:01:57.180> your<00:01:57.360> higher<00:01:57.570> rpm<00:01:58.200> it's<00:01:59.040> running<00:01:59.490> on<00:01:59.579> the

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
want your higher rpm it's running on the

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.270 
want your higher rpm it's running on the
front<00:01:59.969> tire<00:02:00.350> kind<00:02:01.350> of<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.469> same<00:02:01.680> principle<00:02:01.920> as

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
front tire kind of the same principle as

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.800 
front tire kind of the same principle as
a<00:02:02.990> two<00:02:03.990> wheel<00:02:04.140> drive<00:02:05.000> motor<00:02:06.000> cycle<00:02:06.450> type<00:02:06.630> of

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
a two wheel drive motor cycle type of

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.740 
a two wheel drive motor cycle type of
dirt<00:02:07.799> bike<00:02:08.090> but<00:02:09.090> um

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
dirt bike but um

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.020 
dirt bike but um
it's<00:02:11.750> just<00:02:11.959> for<00:02:12.170> cornering<00:02:12.560> and<00:02:12.860> turning<00:02:13.819> that

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
it's just for cornering and turning that

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.280 
it's just for cornering and turning that
kind<00:02:14.300> of<00:02:14.330> thing<00:02:14.480> you<00:02:14.510> might<00:02:14.720> front<00:02:15.080> tire

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
kind of thing you might front tire

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.790 
kind of thing you might front tire
spinning<00:02:16.069> quicker<00:02:16.430> otherwise<00:02:17.000> you'll<00:02:17.300> end<00:02:17.800> up

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
spinning quicker otherwise you'll end up

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.620 
spinning quicker otherwise you'll end up
going<00:02:19.099> over<00:02:19.190> the<00:02:19.430> handlebars<00:02:19.760> but<00:02:22.420> yeah<00:02:23.420> that

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
going over the handlebars but yeah that

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.770 
going over the handlebars but yeah that
was<00:02:23.840> mainly<00:02:24.260> Maya<00:02:24.640> just<00:02:25.640> my<00:02:25.819> inputs<00:02:26.300> on<00:02:26.480> things
