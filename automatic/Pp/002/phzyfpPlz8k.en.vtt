00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:50.980 

maybe<00:01:43.250> a<00:01:43.400> slight<00:01:43.790> delay<00:01:44.150> or<00:01:44.540> laggy<00:01:45.350> this<00:01:49.990> but

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
maybe a slight delay or laggy this but

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.570 
maybe a slight delay or laggy this but

also could change the brush size see

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:13.850 
also could change the brush size see
that<00:01:58.430> works<00:02:02.620> kind<00:02:03.620> of<00:02:03.680> interesting

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.300 

and<00:02:14.400> then<00:02:14.580> yeah

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
and then yeah

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:26.680 
and then yeah
be<00:02:16.849> cool<00:02:17.120> not<00:02:17.300> bad<00:02:18.459> is<00:02:19.459> your<00:02:19.540> eraser

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.360 

so<00:02:43.540> it<00:02:43.900> works<00:02:44.110> pretty<00:02:44.200> fun<00:02:44.650> inside<00:02:44.980> as<00:02:45.100> I<00:02:45.220> can

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
so it works pretty fun inside as I can

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.490

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
see I don't know using this real life or

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.170 
see I don't know using this real life or
in<00:02:50.830> daily<00:02:51.250> life<00:02:51.280> is<00:02:51.730> a<00:02:52.740> good<00:02:53.740> idea<00:02:53.830> but<00:02:54.400> it's<00:02:55.060> up

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
in daily life is a good idea but it's up
