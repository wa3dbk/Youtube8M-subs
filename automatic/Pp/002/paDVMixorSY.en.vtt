LEDs<00:00:03.230> we<00:00:04.230> have<00:00:04.319> a<00:00:04.350> customer<00:00:04.890> requested<00:00:05.370> video

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
LEDs we have a customer requested video

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.540 
LEDs we have a customer requested video
on<00:00:05.940> some<00:00:06.270> of<00:00:06.390> our<00:00:06.480> new<00:00:06.660> products<00:00:07.250> I'll<00:00:08.250> do<00:00:08.519> a

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
on some of our new products I'll do a

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.039 
on some of our new products I'll do a
video<00:00:09.090> on<00:00:09.590> the<00:00:10.590> three<00:00:11.160> LED<00:00:11.610> pods<00:00:12.049> complete

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
video on the three LED pods complete

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.379 
video on the three LED pods complete
video<00:00:13.320> on<00:00:13.559> them<00:00:13.740> in<00:00:13.980> a<00:00:14.040> little<00:00:14.280> bit<00:00:14.429> but<00:00:15.360> first

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
video on them in a little bit but first

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.170 
video on them in a little bit but first
this<00:00:16.320> is<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.800> keychain<00:00:17.250> remote<00:00:17.279> that's<00:00:17.940> with

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
this is the keychain remote that's with

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.200 
this is the keychain remote that's with
this<00:00:18.449> unit<00:00:19.340> basically<00:00:20.340> what<00:00:20.520> you<00:00:20.640> do<00:00:20.820> is<00:00:20.850> you

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
this unit basically what you do is you

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.029 
this unit basically what you do is you
turn<00:00:22.279> bringing<00:00:23.279> 12<00:00:23.519> volt<00:00:23.760> power<00:00:23.970> supply<00:00:24.150> to

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039 
turn bringing 12 volt power supply to

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.890 
turn bringing 12 volt power supply to
this<00:00:26.039> unit<00:00:26.490> has<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:26.849> built-in<00:00:27.390> fuse<00:00:27.779> already

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
this unit has a built-in fuse already

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.470 
this unit has a built-in fuse already
this<00:00:30.900> is<00:00:31.109> an<00:00:31.260> RF<00:00:31.590> antenna<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:32.610> you<00:00:33.270> have

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
this is an RF antenna and you have

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.780 
this is an RF antenna and you have
outputs<00:00:34.050> for<00:00:34.290> your<00:00:34.440> LEDs<00:00:34.920> that<00:00:34.950> yellow<00:00:35.579> is<00:00:35.610> a

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
outputs for your LEDs that yellow is a

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.979 
outputs for your LEDs that yellow is a
positive<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:37.020> black<00:00:37.320> is<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.649> negative

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 
positive the black is a negative

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:41.090 
positive the black is a negative
basically<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.140> only<00:00:40.260> connections<00:00:40.950> you'll

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
basically the only connections you'll

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.490 
basically the only connections you'll
really<00:00:41.340> have<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.640> make<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:42.149> for<00:00:42.629> your<00:00:42.809> pods<00:00:43.079> or

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
really have to make is for your pods or

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.119 
really have to make is for your pods or
your<00:00:43.860> 5<00:00:44.730> millimeter<00:00:45.270> LEDs<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.980> the

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
your 5 millimeter LEDs and to the

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.729 
your 5 millimeter LEDs and to the
battery<00:00:48.440> this<00:00:49.440> simple<00:00:49.980> on/off<00:00:50.550> switch<00:00:51.350> on<00:00:52.350> the

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
battery this simple on/off switch on the

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.040 
battery this simple on/off switch on the
remote<00:00:54.500> we<00:00:55.500> have<00:00:55.620> five<00:00:55.920> colors<00:00:56.370> for<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.610> pods

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
remote we have five colors for the pods

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:03.110 
remote we have five colors for the pods
blue<00:00:58.050> red<00:00:58.590> white<00:00:58.620> yellow<00:00:59.480> green<00:01:01.520> right<00:01:02.520> now<00:01:02.760> in

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
blue red white yellow green right now in

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.240 
blue red white yellow green right now in
the<00:01:03.390> five<00:01:03.930> millimeters<00:01:04.559> we<00:01:04.739> have<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.890> teal

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
the five millimeters we have a teal

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:14.030 
the five millimeters we have a teal
color<00:01:06.049> purple<00:01:07.049> blue<00:01:07.860> white<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.119> red

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.250 

so<00:01:14.730> I'm<00:01:14.940> going<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.240> light<00:01:15.480> this<00:01:15.510> play<00:01:15.960> for<00:01:16.020> you

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:16.260 
so I'm going to light this play for you

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:26.990 
so I'm going to light this play for you
guys<00:01:16.440> just<00:01:18.710> come<00:01:19.710> up

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.990 

see<00:01:28.000> the<00:01:28.800> output<00:01:29.800> on<00:01:29.950> these<00:01:30.160> it's<00:01:30.430> about<00:01:30.670> four

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
see the output on these it's about four

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.900 
see the output on these it's about four
inches<00:01:31.450> away<00:01:31.800> and<00:01:32.800> it's<00:01:32.980> got<00:01:33.160> a<00:01:33.190> good<00:01:33.490> spread

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:33.910 
inches away and it's got a good spread

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.560 
inches away and it's got a good spread
on<00:01:34.210> it<00:01:34.420> so<00:01:35.290> I<00:01:35.770> believe<00:01:36.460> the<00:01:36.760> green<00:01:37.030> is<00:01:37.270> probably

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
on it so I believe the green is probably

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.320 
on it so I believe the green is probably
the<00:01:37.720> brightest<00:01:38.140> out<00:01:38.350> of<00:01:38.440> the<00:01:38.500> group<00:01:40.470> till

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
the brightest out of the group till

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.400 
the brightest out of the group till
Purple's<00:01:43.330> the<00:01:43.510> dentist<00:01:43.930> of<00:01:44.110> the<00:01:44.200> five

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.410 
Purple's the dentist of the five

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.120 
Purple's the dentist of the five
millimeters<00:01:45.540> blue<00:01:46.540> is<00:01:46.690> very<00:01:46.930> bright<00:01:47.260> whites

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
millimeters blue is very bright whites

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.830 
millimeters blue is very bright whites
really<00:01:48.580> bright<00:01:49.890> reds<00:01:50.890> a<00:01:51.040> little<00:01:51.250> dimmer<00:01:51.490> and

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
really bright reds a little dimmer and

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.800 
really bright reds a little dimmer and
then<00:01:52.840> greens<00:01:53.320> fairly<00:01:53.860> bright<00:01:54.070> as<00:01:54.310> well<00:01:54.810> again

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
then greens fairly bright as well again

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.680 
then greens fairly bright as well again
this<00:01:55.990> is<00:01:56.050> an<00:01:56.350> on-off<00:01:56.890> set<00:01:57.369> up<00:01:58.140> hit<00:01:59.140> the<00:01:59.290> button

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
this is an on-off set up hit the button

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.090 
this is an on-off set up hit the button
we<00:02:01.690> are<00:02:01.810> in<00:02:01.960> a<00:02:01.990> little<00:02:02.290> bit<00:02:02.440> of<00:02:02.530> light<00:02:02.770> right

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
we are in a little bit of light right

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.460 
we are in a little bit of light right
now<00:02:03.130> so<00:02:03.640> they<00:02:03.880> are<00:02:04.030> brighter<00:02:04.420> when<00:02:05.290> it's

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
now so they are brighter when it's

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.200 
now so they are brighter when it's
darker<00:02:05.950> just<00:02:06.280> helps<00:02:06.610> to<00:02:06.640> have<00:02:06.759> a<00:02:06.820> little<00:02:07.000> bit

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
darker just helps to have a little bit

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.290 
darker just helps to have a little bit
of<00:02:07.240> light<00:02:07.420> for<00:02:07.630> the<00:02:07.690> camera<00:02:08.050> shot
