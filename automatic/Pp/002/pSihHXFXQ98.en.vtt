 on the Sumerian clay tablets 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:13.590
 state submitted terms of government 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:19.830
 8 kings olurem rules 28 thousand years king 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:22.680
 Duma tooth 36000 king and board that 18 thousand 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:28.410
 years they were all by today's concepts 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:29.010
 animals don't accept raw foodists 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.570
 squirrels 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.910
 that is, do not eat meat fish 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.630
 seafood and vegetables and fruits by their 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.790
 philosophy 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.210
 should not be exposed to any 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.700
 heat treatment syroed who already 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.879
 settled in this food can 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.039
 eating two to three apples forget to Food 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.660
 day after tomorrow 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:54.739
 once it was thought that raw foods 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.420
 defective in the body does not enter 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:01.289
 the right amount of animal protein 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.960
 origin however last 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:07.430
 research has shown that animal protein 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:11.299
 in the body syroeda with proper nutrition 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.299
 comes in the right quantity 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:19.189
 like a camel or elephant cow 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:23.000
 they, too, do not eat meat but they 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:26.649
 muscle mass somehow grows on everything 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.250
 the fact is that the vegetation eaten 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:34.009
 overgrowth in the stomach with beneficial bacteria 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.500
 cow per day can eat up to 70 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:39.439
 kilograms of hay 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:42.670
 to give birth in the stomach to 5 kilograms 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:47.630
 good bacteria which she then 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:51.099
 assimilates that is the cow daily 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.709
 can receive up to 5 kilos of pure 

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:56.869
 animal protein 

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:59.599
 the finale is a hidden predation 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:02.209
 it turns out and by this principle all live 

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:04.840
 herbivores and elephants and giraffes and 

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:08.810
 camels who see in their entire lives 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:12.280
 I love the same beetle pen 1 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:16.790
 raw food restaurant was open usa 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:20.750
 1917 he successfully existed until 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:23.569
 beginning of the second world war official 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.560
 science and pharmaceuticals actively fought 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.670
 raw foodists 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.819
 whose slogan is life without disease or 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.819
 karst could hurt the business that is 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:36.840
 reduce sales of pills and other 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:42.310
 chemical preparations 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:44.319
 defeated business 2 surge raw foods 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.830
 occurred in the sixties of the past 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:52.300
 centuries in America there were shops 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:55.300
 for vegetarians and raw foodists it was 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.459
 caused by the interest of the general public to 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.250
 popular hippie movement 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:03.130
 who preached oneness with 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:08.190
 nature and opposed the murder 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:11.769
 animals and their use of meat for food 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:14.370
 then came the scientific articles about what 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:17.260
 heat treated and yes it's me 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:20.650
 since all the useful ones are killed in it 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:23.670
 bacteria and bad bacteria on the contrary 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.860
 multiply hard 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.130
 Eugeny is 40 years old 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:31.230
 four years has been keen on raw foods 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:34.410
 say that there is one in raw food 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:37.500
 subtlety for the full absorption of the animal 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:40.970
 protein in the form of bacteria raw foodists should 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:46.140
 eat no more than 1 time per day and 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:48.240
 better not more than 2 times a week if we 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.010
 rule the disciplines and will not go before 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.630
 over time these bacteria freeze from and 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.110
 absorbed in the small intestine 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:58.830
 high quality protein video 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:04:00.390
 that is, a raw foodist even though he does not eat 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.030
 nothing animal on him every day 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.870
 animal digestion occurs 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.000
 of origin 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.070
 the form of bacteria is high quality 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.810
 the food because I did not kill it 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.090
 right there immediately all of you like this 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.690
 god of all, as it were invented and the main 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.690
 it does not break
