00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:10.560
 there is something important 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:13.030
 we have 

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:16.090
 one more cap machine 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:18.010
 this machine is for these types of 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.090
 watches that comes with these caps towards 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:24.820
 non-threaded pressure that are very hard to 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:28.740
 to close because one simply makes 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.740
 this comes with a set of drinks 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:37.530
 which then according to the size of the 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.530
 box according to him 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:45.730
 we have them how do you notice there are some 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.010
 that are full-based 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.410
 although I below for both 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:54.160
 they are smooth as there are others that 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:56.400
 above they are smooth and below they have 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.770
 a cavity 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.610
 so that life is brought out 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:05.500
 I take this watch again 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:07.840
 it shows what was normally stressed 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:11.170
 suppose that this type of thing does not 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.340
 is easily covering what we do 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.260
 remember that for is with a clock 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.260
 these these have a mosque 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:23.030
 of the tapatÃ­a that a notch this stage 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.850
 it means that it goes here to the side 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.610
 of the crown so as not to damage this strip is 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.260
 a cavity that remains 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.180
 then that cavity 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:36.100
 we face it with the crown 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.250
 so what we do 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:42.960
 we search 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:45.330
 a lid a lid of these a base is 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.240
 what is discovered is so that the 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:51.780
 glass that will not soon go it us 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:55.170
 damage if we put it flat if not this 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.070
 will take this bevel will take the bevel of 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.630
 the box to see us 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.229
 fortress and 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.640
 then it is not taking nor the crown 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.750
 nor is taking the glass crystal 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.750
 its free 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.510
 and complement we look for one that gives us 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.400
 exactly 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.540
 this is a little narrower 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.540
 that be more precise 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:26.130
 so continue 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.860
 but in what takes what is the part of 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:32.640
 the cap on the shot exactly because if 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:35.100
 we take a very small one and relies on the 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:39.390
 central part may the lid not the 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:42.870
 do not add the sum and we damage the lid by 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.819
 that is used an accurate remain since 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:49.440
 It can be totally ready or it can be 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:53.370
 with the base in 5 that is done 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:56.000
 this as you see have two bases quotes what 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.000
 what we do 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:03.900
 we apply a base and in the other porch 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.630
 the top cap 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.690
 for the other 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:11.910
 vargas 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.910
 then we put 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.300
 we subject we verify that the 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.540
 crown will not be too tight 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:22.880
 by any of these tabs or flipped 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:25.010
 because this machine can also be 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:29.480
 be running that we have left think 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:32.709
 entry once simply entered 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.709
 we do the pressure 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:46.870
 this is already because they take at this stage 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:48.460
 it is not hard to press is soft 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.210
 there are others that have more strength and that 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:54.010
 when one does it simply feels 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:56.110
 trachea when you are not understanding that already 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:59.110
 It stayed the same when you are well watch 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.670
 it is verified well by all sides that 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.920
 has been well covered because sometimes 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.720
 is banished to one side 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:08.300
 they have to be very precise 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.030
 these same cups these same bases 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.950
 the ones that I showed him at the beginning when 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.290
 I showed you the basis of the watches for 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.079
 work the machinery because I also 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:20.150
 I use one of these at times to 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:24.480
 work in machinery are more comfortable 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:27.980
 and being plastic do not scratch 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.980
 at the top no piece 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.180
 A) Yes 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.880
 the good eat very useful 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:40.580
 in the sense that we have working 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:44.270
 a lot with pressure stage clock that 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.770
 do not close us like this kind of 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.330
 stages then 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:52.090
 each group 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:54.040
 we can also accommodate it 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:57.910
 we can cover it with our guys 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:05:01.129
 of two there are ones that give that ability 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:04.159
 cover the lid 

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:06.879
 this clamp that you have shown to the 

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:10.610
 principle as you see is a plastic piece 

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:12.090
 it is used a lot although although many do not 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:15.300
 They use it 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.980
 much is used for the management of 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.240
 batteries 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:24.170
 so that for one to be one precisely 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:26.010
 this of contacting the 

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:29.910
 completely because the downloads 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:31.899
 then with the same clamp they are handled 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.840
 to put them 

00:05:31.899 --> 00:05:35.310
 manipulate them 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.070
 here there is no problem that this is the 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:42.840
 positive and negative the lower part of the 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:44.430
 problem so maneuvers are not useful are 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.380
 extremely necessary but sometimes 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:49.340
 are used 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.340
 but they are not 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:55.100
 I have some accessories here these are 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:58.490
 tools that very few are used 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:00.210
 as for special cases are 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:04.910
 punches 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:04.910
 you see they come in different ways 

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:09.420
 these are independent there is a machine 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.510
 for this but I do not have it then 

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:14.300
 had to adapt 

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:17.240
 a hole in the table a table the 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.600
 jewelry to be able to seat to be able 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.430
 to work 

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:25.230
 this 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:30.160
 these points do not work there is no variety 

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:33.460
 of uses for example in the video of 

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:36.220
 the clock measured when the tube was released 

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:39.790
 central I had to get help from a 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:42.130
 tube of these to be able to close and 

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:45.160
 settle well in this central as what 

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:49.060
 I did then using one a cavity of 

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:50.930
 you're great to put the base and 

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:54.320
 over 

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:56.300
 with another one more guy hit him from the 

00:06:54.320 --> 00:07:00.380
 stage but those are the very cases 

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:03.310
 special supplements if they are not 

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:03.310
 all necessary 

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:10.050
 I think that at the moment that's what 

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:10.050
 basic tools that if we go 

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:16.500
 and in others there are other specials that 

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:18.560
 use when the damage is already extreme 

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:22.600
 because they need 

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.600
 make preparations
