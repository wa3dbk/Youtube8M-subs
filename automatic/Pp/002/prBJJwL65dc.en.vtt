00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.599

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.170
 trigger then as it was my 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.630
 I will receive the anniversary 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:18.900
 then this is the rigor of newt that 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.520
 50 euros cold yes so early I 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.289
 prefer not to spend too much on 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:30.060
 keaton helmets and after really if they 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:32.640
 are really good to buy them 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.710
 dearest good quick it's not so I 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.989
 will you represent little tutor how 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.800
 plug in the triton then because there I 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.420
 just bought it and I galley at the 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.350
 climb I'll try already and then there 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.760
 I wanted to make a short video 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:50.129
 for you you show yourself a little 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.020
 how does it connect everything it is 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.320
 really not easy to plug me 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.379
 I tried it is a bit shocking but 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:14.030
 so here it is the tri time 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:14.030
 there's touch that just released the love 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:29.479
 I then learned blue galamaz has it 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.609
 taken for if there is a little worry with 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:35.509
 connections for TV lan 

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:39.259
 cable of 4 m 3 I think they get 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:44.240
 split in two parts the usb part 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:48.619
 the key usb drive and the other part was going 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:51.770
 the red and white cable then you 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.909
 then take everything from the case then 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.119
 the case is up there 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:59.270
 so I'm going to shoot for miss it's 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.920
 this case then on the side there will be 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.250
 two volumes 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:07.969
 the volume on the left that you see here 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:10.369
 this is the volume of the game corner of the beggars 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:12.230
 to reach the other enemies and 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.390
 that's the volume of conversation 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.989
 then the whole system connects to 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:21.109
 from this case then this is it 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:25.459
 the other one here and there is the little button 

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:27.349
 to mute the players who speak 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.480
 too much that make you shit then you 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:31.519
 take the case I'll try to 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.400
 well filmed because I hold the 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:38.260
 casing at the end the camera by hand 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:43.780
 then you take the cable wire 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:48.079
 this one you plug it on top 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:50.780
