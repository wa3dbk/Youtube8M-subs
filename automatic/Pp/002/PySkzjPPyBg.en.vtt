00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
sounds like now again this is the

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.440 
sounds like now again this is the
stealth<00:01:48.780> version<00:01:49.290> not<00:01:49.830> the<00:01:50.190> green<00:01:50.430> clicky<00:01:50.850> so

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
stealth version not the green clicky so

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.700 
stealth version not the green clicky so
I'm<00:01:51.540> just<00:01:51.659> gonna<00:01:51.780> type<00:01:51.990> some<00:01:52.200> random<00:01:52.470> stuff

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
and it's kind of hard leaning over my

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.380 
and it's kind of hard leaning over my
camera<00:01:58.470> to<00:01:58.560> do<00:01:58.710> this<00:02:01.760> that's<00:02:02.760> how<00:02:02.909> it<00:02:03.030> sounds

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
camera to do this that's how it sounds

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.810 
camera to do this that's how it sounds
and<00:02:03.510> of<00:02:03.570> course<00:02:03.750> when<00:02:03.840> you're<00:02:03.930> gaming<00:02:04.820> just

as well now the cool thing is this

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.690 
as well now the cool thing is this
little<00:02:20.240> game<00:02:20.569> mode<00:02:20.840> icon<00:02:21.020> so<00:02:21.440> it's<00:02:21.590> G<00:02:21.890> was<00:02:22.670> a

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
little game mode icon so it's G was a

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.880 
little game mode icon so it's G was a
target<00:02:23.120> around<00:02:23.209> it<00:02:23.420> for<00:02:23.569> game<00:02:23.750> mode<00:02:23.959> what<00:02:24.739> that

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
target around it for game mode what that

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.290 
target around it for game mode what that
basically<00:02:25.040> means<00:02:25.190> I<00:02:25.459> compress<00:02:25.819> this<00:02:26.000> window

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
basically means I compress this window

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.180 
basically means I compress this window
key<00:02:26.450> all<00:02:26.690> day<00:02:26.959> long<00:02:27.200> and<00:02:27.530> it<00:02:27.860> won't<00:02:28.040> do<00:02:28.160> a

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
key all day long and it won't do a

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.010 
key all day long and it won't do a
single<00:02:28.459> thing<00:02:28.610> so<00:02:29.420> you're<00:02:29.569> not<00:02:29.660> going<00:02:29.840> to

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020

as the green slash clicky switches again
this<00:03:50.450> is<00:03:50.660> stealth<00:03:50.959> so<00:03:51.170> I<00:03:51.200> feel<00:03:51.500> like<00:03:51.530> maybe<00:03:51.859> the

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
this is stealth so I feel like maybe the

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.090 
this is stealth so I feel like maybe the
the<00:03:52.790> mushy<00:03:53.090> feel<00:03:53.540> is<00:03:53.780> how<00:03:53.989> they<00:03:54.290> make<00:03:54.769> it<00:03:54.950> a

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
the mushy feel is how they make it a

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.150 
the mushy feel is how they make it a
stealth<00:03:55.670> version<00:03:56.239> but<00:03:57.079> from<00:03:57.859> where<00:03:58.010> I<00:03:58.040> came

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
stealth version but from where I came

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.789 
stealth version but from where I came
before<00:03:58.570> this<00:03:59.570> is<00:03:59.690> a<00:03:59.720> true<00:03:59.959> gaming<00:04:00.350> keyboard

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 
before this is a true gaming keyboard

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:02.979 
before this is a true gaming keyboard
and<00:04:01.040> I<00:04:01.730> can<00:04:01.970> actually<00:04:02.299> differentiate<00:04:02.720> it<00:04:02.930> and

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
and I can actually differentiate it and

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:06.310 
and I can actually differentiate it and
tell<00:04:03.260> now<00:04:03.790> when<00:04:04.790> I'm<00:04:04.989> pressing<00:04:05.989> different

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:06.320 
tell now when I'm pressing different

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.410 
tell now when I'm pressing different
buttons<00:04:06.590> you<00:04:06.769> know<00:04:07.030> WASD<00:04:08.030> I<00:04:08.150> can<00:04:08.299> actually

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
buttons you know WASD I can actually

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.509 
buttons you know WASD I can actually
tell<00:04:08.750> now<00:04:08.959> if<00:04:09.019> I'm<00:04:09.200> pressing<00:04:09.590> a<00:04:09.829> pressing<00:04:10.370> D<00:04:10.489> I

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 
tell now if I'm pressing a pressing D I

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:12.849 
tell now if I'm pressing a pressing D I
can<00:04:10.640> actually<00:04:10.730> feel<00:04:11.150> that<00:04:11.989> difference<00:04:12.410> so<00:04:12.470> I

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:12.859 
can actually feel that difference so I

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:18.310 
can actually feel that difference so I
absolutely<00:04:13.760> love<00:04:14.180> the<00:04:14.359> keyboard<00:04:14.810> again

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.360 

that's<00:04:19.320> how<00:04:19.470> it<00:04:19.590> sounds<00:04:19.950> when<00:04:20.040> you're<00:04:20.190> typing

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
that's how it sounds when you're typing

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.190 
that's how it sounds when you're typing
again<00:04:21.120> this<00:04:21.180> is<00:04:21.330> a<00:04:21.420> stealth<00:04:21.750> version<00:04:22.110> so

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
again this is a stealth version so

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.840 
again this is a stealth version so
you're<00:04:22.320> not<00:04:23.420> you're<00:04:24.420> not<00:04:24.450> getting<00:04:24.720> that<00:04:24.810> click

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
you're not you're not getting that click

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.220 
you're not you're not getting that click
if<00:04:26.850> I<00:04:27.090> were<00:04:27.180> to<00:04:27.270> do<00:04:27.360> it<00:04:27.390> again<00:04:27.600> I<00:04:27.630> would<00:04:27.960> buy<00:04:28.170> the

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
if I were to do it again I would buy the

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.200 
if I were to do it again I would buy the
clicky<00:04:28.620> version<00:04:28.980> but<00:04:29.310> either<00:04:29.460> way<00:04:29.610> if<00:04:29.910> you're

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
clicky version but either way if you're

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.990 
clicky version but either way if you're
just<00:04:30.360> asking<00:04:30.540> for<00:04:30.780> my<00:04:31.020> final<00:04:31.980> thoughts<00:04:32.340> should
