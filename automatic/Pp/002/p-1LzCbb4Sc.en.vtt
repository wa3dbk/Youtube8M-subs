00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.399 
but what I did was on my pokemon black 2
which<00:01:41.670> is<00:01:41.850> where<00:01:42.000> I<00:01:42.030> traded<00:01:42.450> my<00:01:42.570> restaurant<00:01:43.200> I

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
which is where I traded my restaurant I

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.850 
which is where I traded my restaurant I
went<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.220> summary<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:45.259> looked<00:01:46.259> like

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
went to the summary and looked like

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.069 
went to the summary and looked like
where<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.520> says<00:01:47.700> apparently<00:01:48.180> met<00:01:48.360> at<00:01:48.450> level<00:01:48.689> 50

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
where it says apparently met at level 50

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.920 
where it says apparently met at level 50
and<00:01:49.159> castle<00:01:50.159> scatters<00:01:50.909> things<00:01:51.270> off<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.720> that

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
and castle scatters things off and that

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.399 
and castle scatters things off and that
really<00:01:52.140> doesn't<00:01:52.350> matter<00:01:52.560> anything<00:01:53.659> and<00:01:54.659> then

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
really doesn't matter anything and then

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.709 
really doesn't matter anything and then
I<00:01:55.500> made<00:01:55.680> sure<00:01:55.950> that<00:01:55.979> I<00:01:56.159> put<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.790> moves<00:01:57.060> how<00:01:57.630> it

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
I made sure that I put the moves how it

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:03.230 
I made sure that I put the moves how it
was<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.290> I<00:01:58.619> did<00:01:58.829> make<00:01:59.040> mine<00:01:59.310> level<00:01:59.820> 100<00:02:00.590> so<00:02:02.240> but

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
was and I did make mine level 100 so but

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.170 
was and I did make mine level 100 so but
anyway<00:02:03.570> when<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:03.899> get<00:02:04.049> that<00:02:04.259> you<00:02:04.320> can<00:02:05.180> upload

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
anyway when you get that you can upload

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.649 
anyway when you get that you can upload
it<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.390> your<00:02:06.630> DS

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:08.659

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
I was gonna show it and like that it

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.309 
I was gonna show it and like that it
worked<00:02:13.249> and<00:02:13.430> everything<00:02:13.700> but<00:02:14.599> that<00:02:14.959> would

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
worked and everything but that would

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.229 
worked and everything but that would
make<00:02:15.409> this<00:02:15.590> video<00:02:15.920> so<00:02:15.980> much<00:02:16.549> longer<00:02:16.790> than<00:02:17.120> it

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
make this video so much longer than it

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:24.039 
make this video so much longer than it
really<00:02:17.359> needs<00:02:17.569> to<00:02:17.870> be<00:02:18.730> pretty<00:02:19.730> much<00:02:22.510> do<00:02:23.510> it<00:02:23.540> try

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.049 
really needs to be pretty much do it try

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:25.809 
really needs to be pretty much do it try
it<00:02:24.079> out<00:02:24.260> if<00:02:24.530> you<00:02:24.709> can't<00:02:24.950> get<00:02:25.099> it<00:02:25.189> to<00:02:25.310> work

assume it would work the same way was
there<00:03:34.340> chrome<00:03:34.669> and<00:03:37.599> let's<00:03:38.599> see<00:03:38.870> it<00:03:39.439> would

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
there chrome and let's see it would

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.539 
there chrome and let's see it would
probably<00:03:39.829> work<00:03:40.099> for<00:03:40.569> kyurem<00:03:41.569> as<00:03:41.750> well<00:03:41.959> and<00:03:42.620> it
