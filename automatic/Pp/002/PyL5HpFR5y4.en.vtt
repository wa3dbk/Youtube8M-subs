00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:05.510
 hehehehe here again came game 

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:07.400
 walking in a new class gameplay 

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:10.669
 plans and this time is how they could have 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:13.549
 seen the title we are this in a video 

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:16.930
 of how I already farm it as megan 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:20.510
 resources so let's get to the point this 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:22.400
 as you can see we are already 26 of 50 well 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.710
 that there is a lot of space in the clan itself 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.680
 like to enter the requirements are to be 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:30.320
 level plus 85 and municipalities- 9 the 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.710
 ride pigs to level 4 and up and 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.970
 the bad ones at level 5 onwards very well 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.130
 this we are going to see the attacks that I have 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:40.040
 done because the truth and we made a 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:43.850
 clean the clan because you arm me like 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:46.970
 we've been losing is amazing and I 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.829
 in 45 attack we made them 54 clearly 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.140
 We could have won but anyway now 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.820
 happened that we already lost that more is not 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.239
 it's nothing good we're going to see the 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.969
 repetitions this how can I see 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:04.559
 the block with 40 barbarians and 180 archers to 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:06.180
 I fit 220 this spaces so 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.729
 with city hall in fact when I 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.979
 they fit 200 spaces attacked with 40 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.689
 barbarians and the other archers very well 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.150
 once explained with what attacked we are going to 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.090
 see the repetitions 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.260
 this more than anything attack by the 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.590
 dark the truth that has a honk 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:24.660
 As you can see I had 5000 entrusted 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.750
 dark and right now is what I most 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.940
 matter first he called the barbarian king 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.560
 this with the archers and loose some 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.500
 how many few to see if there are no bombs 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.600
 giant clear is that and meanwhile 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.550
 I here mask also attack him because 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.410
 the town hall was outside and not 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.840
 lose glasses well clear attack it well 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.520
 You tell me what you wear 40 Barbarians 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.980
 I have to distract the defenses 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.760
 as you can see in fabrics the kills them 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:52.619
 two shots and the and the cannons and all 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.810
 the archers also two shots is 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.520
 that's why they last longer and contentions 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.530
 I put the archers because they can see with 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.380
 that the archers here kills you 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.869
 cannon shot and look here for two cannon shots 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.090
 here you can see that's why I took them 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.790
 of distraction more than anything and there 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.649
 start to release archers to take me 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:14.610
 it's dark and how little there was gold and 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.470
 elixir be in the mines well once already 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.200
 destroyed this part we go by 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.130
 we were going ahead a bit because I 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.900
 in reflector 3 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.760
 I do not have the license or anything allows me 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.860
 record 10 minutes 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:29.480
 so let's put it a little faster 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:31.310
 here the king can not kill him like that 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.530
 Queen as well as you know many 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.620
 they have much less life so that 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.269
 it's much easier to kill this one well 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.640
 here you can see that I loose many 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:42.730
 archers on this side to take me that 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:47.090
 dark that the truth was a good booty 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:51.079
 2,700 m the guide pardon the 2,700 that is 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:56.090
 good this since I recommend you do 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:58.489
 farming in crystal 3 since as there 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.909
 of all the resources there is gold elixir and 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:05.299
 dark since in silver ordos one that 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:07.519
 many do for mine and have no 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:09.129
 has so much does not have so much dark the 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:11.389
 true that it does have many resources 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:13.970
 natural like who says it's gold 

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:17.510
 and the elixir but dark do not have much 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:20.480
 here you can see that I have good booties 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:23.379
 like this dark 2400 891 thousand 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:26.540
 dark and 2,220 dark the truth that 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:29.170
 yesterday I started with 20 tiny and I finished 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.610
 with 39 thousand 400 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:34.220
 I have not increased because 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.720
 collectors are under construction as well 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.480
 that's good and today he has not highlighted because 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:41.540
 as soon as the shield came down, let's go 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.760
 to see the other repetition that the truth 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.550
 is that look here there are good booties the 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.170
 truth and here they will see what the 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.430
 attention of the queen let's put it in 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.040
 two so it 's faster and more 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.750
 fluid this and well if I recommend them 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.540
 do that for the barbarians because with 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:59.750
 anyone like for example these 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.880
 mortars this one if you release the values ​​of 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.440
 Dow kill two fingers and mortars as 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.870
 they are already in the mortars reload every 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.880
 five seconds that's why I recommend 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.430
 bring the barbarians because like here 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.440
 can see this one kills two fingers 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.989
 mortars well because the archers 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.280
 kill one for example other level 6 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:19.880
 I already kill the archers of a 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:22.910
 dead right here does not kill the king is and 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:25.340
 if not kill him since since I had him 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.800
 like warehouses stores 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.840
 gatherers were so separated is 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.900
 better for example call the king for this 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.870
 side and attack here this side so that 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:38.440
 this goes around his village 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:42.050
 here we see how I take all the 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.760
 resources he killed in line and to make 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.920
 the 50 percent that I did have now 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.800
 what to do and what I had left 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:51.260
 dark collector here was 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.560
 practically full but pity that 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:57.110
 a very low level and then we are also going to 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.000
 see how and to the percentage 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.130
 percentage we put it to 4 because we no longer 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.500
 there's more to steal are toni stuffed already 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:05.600
 my queen and well I do 50 percent a 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.689
 file ok let's see the other two 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:12.069
 repetitions 

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:14.709
 and this is good this is the last day 

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:16.029
 today and is what I recommend you about 

00:05:14.709 --> 00:05:19.269
 the design of algae and many have 

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:20.799
 said and many commented the video that 

00:05:19.269 --> 00:05:23.799
 want to write sexual comes the 

00:05:20.799 --> 00:05:26.739
 next video will be that or if it will not be 

00:05:23.799 --> 00:05:29.829
 of a surge that opens live in 

00:05:26.739 --> 00:05:33.339
 an attack that recommended me the wat and 

00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:34.989
 someone from the clan well this here we see 

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:38.289
 as he destroyed with the rays ah by 

00:05:34.989 --> 00:05:40.959
 certain of spells diego 2-2 of ryan and 2 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:42.789
 of healing the healing by in some 

00:05:40.959 --> 00:05:44.889
 given time I have a forty and 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:47.319
 so many percent drop the king barbarians 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:49.959
 and to the castle from behind and continue 

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:53.309
 healing the magicians who have donated me 

00:05:49.959 --> 00:05:56.319
 well here again we see the typical the 

00:05:53.309 --> 00:05:58.749
 the distraction barbarians a few 

00:05:56.319 --> 00:06:00.689
 alter archers from the back level 6 but 

00:05:58.749 --> 00:06:03.579
 with level 5 anyway works well 

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:05.799
 so it's good here we can see that 

00:06:03.579 --> 00:06:07.360
 if it is very practical that of the kings of 

00:06:05.799 --> 00:06:09.879

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:12.069
