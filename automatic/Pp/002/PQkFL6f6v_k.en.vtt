Peggy<00:00:00.510> de<00:00:00.780> todo

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.650 

when<00:00:18.520> we<00:00:18.640> came<00:00:18.760> out<00:00:18.910> with<00:00:19.000> Saint<00:00:19.240> row<00:00:19.360> one

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:19.660 
when we came out with Saint row one

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.420 
when we came out with Saint row one
there<00:00:20.320> really<00:00:20.590> weren't<00:00:20.740> that<00:00:20.860> many<00:00:21.070> open

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:21.430 
there really weren't that many open

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.310 
there really weren't that many open
world<00:00:21.610> games<00:00:21.790> that<00:00:21.970> were<00:00:22.029> out<00:00:22.180> there<00:00:22.420> and<00:00:22.779> I

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:23.320 
world games that were out there and I

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.900 
world games that were out there and I
think<00:00:23.560> they<00:00:23.650> at<00:00:23.830> this<00:00:23.980> point<00:00:24.310> in<00:00:24.369> the<00:00:24.460> industry

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:24.910 
think they at this point in the industry

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.429 
think they at this point in the industry
it's<00:00:25.240> pretty<00:00:25.509> tough<00:00:25.720> to<00:00:25.779> come<00:00:26.020> up<00:00:26.050> with<00:00:26.140> a<00:00:26.290> game

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:26.439 
it's pretty tough to come up with a game

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:28.200 
it's pretty tough to come up with a game
that<00:00:26.619> really<00:00:26.800> is<00:00:27.040> unlike<00:00:27.490> anything<00:00:27.759> else<00:00:28.029> out

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.210 
that really is unlike anything else out

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.300 
that really is unlike anything else out
there

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.310 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.950 

that's<00:00:31.939> one<00:00:32.059> of<00:00:32.149> the<00:00:32.210> things<00:00:32.270> that<00:00:32.599> I<00:00:32.750> think

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
that's one of the things that I think

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.569 
that's one of the things that I think
the<00:00:33.200> people<00:00:33.380> have<00:00:33.559> always<00:00:33.710> loved<00:00:34.070> about<00:00:34.280> Saint

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579 
the people have always loved about Saint

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:36.639 
the people have always loved about Saint
row<00:00:34.790> there's<00:00:35.570> nothing<00:00:35.750> else<00:00:36.020> like<00:00:36.260> that<00:00:36.320> in

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:36.649 
row there's nothing else like that in

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:38.200 
row there's nothing else like that in
terms<00:00:36.800> of<00:00:36.950> the<00:00:37.040> tone<00:00:37.309> in<00:00:37.640> terms<00:00:37.850> of<00:00:37.970> all<00:00:38.090> the

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
terms of the tone in terms of all the

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.450 
terms of the tone in terms of all the
options<00:00:38.450> and<00:00:39.050> the<00:00:39.379> over-the-top<00:00:39.800> nature<00:00:40.370> of

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
options and the over-the-top nature of

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.119 
options and the over-the-top nature of
everything<00:00:41.230> put<00:00:42.230> in<00:00:42.260> your<00:00:42.440> tampons<00:00:42.829> and<00:00:42.980> let's

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
everything put in your tampons and let's

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.380 
everything put in your tampons and let's
do<00:00:43.309> this

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.420 

it's<00:00:47.960> kind<00:00:48.079> of<00:00:48.170> like<00:00:48.230> improv<00:00:48.739> building<00:00:49.220> on<00:00:49.309> top

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
it's kind of like improv building on top

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.130 
it's kind of like improv building on top
of<00:00:49.610> it<00:00:49.700> and<00:00:49.910> then<00:00:50.300> you<00:00:50.360> can<00:00:50.450> take<00:00:50.660> a<00:00:50.750> step<00:00:50.930> back

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
of it and then you can take a step back

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.080 
of it and then you can take a step back
and<00:00:51.170> look<00:00:51.410> at<00:00:51.500> while<00:00:51.649> what<00:00:51.770> you<00:00:51.860> fraid

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090
