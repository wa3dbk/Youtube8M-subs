gives it great advantage for us as

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.160 
gives it great advantage for us as
researchers<00:01:05.010> because<00:01:05.640> we<00:01:06.420> can<00:01:06.570> bring<00:01:06.810> theory

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
researchers because we can bring theory

researchers because we can bring theory
into<00:01:07.260> practice<00:01:07.350> we<00:01:08.250> need<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.490> take<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.850> design

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
into practice we need to take the design

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.390 
into practice we need to take the design
we<00:01:09.450> need<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.689> take<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.140> break<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.100> down<00:01:11.189> to

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
we need to take and break it down to

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.789 
we need to take and break it down to
basic<00:01:11.760> theories<00:01:12.260> fundamental<00:01:13.260> theories<00:01:13.619> and

very fast getting and working prototype
right<00:01:46.590> before<00:01:47.070> we<00:01:47.820> had<00:01:47.939> to<00:01:48.090> go<00:01:48.270> through<00:01:48.780> the

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
right before we had to go through the

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.440 
right before we had to go through the
process<00:01:49.290> of<00:01:49.909> manufacturing<00:01:50.909> in<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.299> real

process of manufacturing in the real
workshop<00:01:52.229> we<00:01:52.409> takes<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.710> lot<00:01:52.829> of<00:01:52.860> time<00:01:53.420> and<00:01:54.420> a

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
workshop we takes a lot of time and a

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.469 
workshop we takes a lot of time and a
lot<00:01:54.600> of<00:01:54.750> efforts<00:01:55.259> here<00:01:56.070> we<00:01:56.250> can<00:01:56.430> build<00:01:56.640> we<00:01:57.270> can

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
lot of efforts here we can build we can

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.530 
lot of efforts here we can build we can
test<00:01:57.750> you<00:01:58.110> can<00:01:58.259> see<00:01:58.409> where<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.680> failures<00:01:59.100> are

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
test you can see where the failures are

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.209 
test you can see where the failures are
doing<00:02:00.540> scaled-down<00:02:01.020> of<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.439> experiments<00:02:02.070> and

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
doing scaled-down of the experiments and

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.999 
doing scaled-down of the experiments and
then<00:02:02.969> go<00:02:03.719> back<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.990> our<00:02:04.200> drawing<00:02:04.500> boards<00:02:04.890> in

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
then go back to our drawing boards in

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.440 
then go back to our drawing boards in
our<00:02:05.130> calculation<00:02:05.729> and

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
our calculation and

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.859 
our calculation and
improve<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:07.289> design<00:02:07.469> and<00:02:08.569> of<00:02:09.569> course<00:02:09.780> a

improve the design and of course a

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.720 
improve the design and of course a

designer of the frontier is that doesn't
have<00:02:23.489> to<00:02:23.580> think<00:02:23.790> about<00:02:24.030> this<00:02:24.180> anymore<00:02:24.330> just

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
have to think about this anymore just

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.589 
have to think about this anymore just
draw<00:02:25.769> your<00:02:26.010> parts<00:02:26.400> as<00:02:26.610> you<00:02:26.730> think<00:02:27.000> of<00:02:27.150> it<00:02:27.330> and

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
draw your parts as you think of it and

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.830 
draw your parts as you think of it and
you<00:02:28.319> can<00:02:28.500> print<00:02:28.709> it<00:02:28.860> if<00:02:28.980> you<00:02:29.099> have<00:02:29.250> enough

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
you can print it if you have enough

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.020 
you can print it if you have enough
experience<00:02:31.280> then<00:02:32.280> even<00:02:32.790> with<00:02:32.940> this

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
experience then even with this

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.430 
experience then even with this
technology<00:02:33.500> you<00:02:34.500> can<00:02:34.650> avoid<00:02:34.920> this<00:02:35.220> these

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
technology you can avoid this these

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.830 
technology you can avoid this these
failure<00:02:37.440> points<00:02:37.860> and<00:02:38.010> actually<00:02:38.519> build<00:02:38.840> parts

and<00:03:16.579> that<00:03:17.579> is<00:03:17.700> the<00:03:18.170> impose<00:03:19.170> on<00:03:19.319> us<00:03:19.440> that<00:03:19.590> we

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
and that is the impose on us that we

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.120 
and that is the impose on us that we
actually<00:03:20.010> need<00:03:20.430> a<00:03:21.329> wide<00:03:21.959> range<00:03:22.230> or<00:03:22.590> spectrum

when we looked for this technology we

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.930 
when we looked for this technology we

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:23.289 
properties then you can avoid using

properties then you can avoid using
third-party<00:04:25.360> parts<00:04:26.360> that<00:04:27.039> this<00:04:28.039> is<00:04:28.160> usually

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
third-party parts that this is usually

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.990 
third-party parts that this is usually
where<00:04:28.760> the<00:04:29.740> for<00:04:30.740> the<00:04:30.800> failure<00:04:31.160> points<00:04:31.580> are<00:04:31.760> to

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
where the for the failure points are to

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.900 
where the for the failure points are to
combinate<00:04:32.449> where<00:04:32.630> were<00:04:32.840> you<00:04:32.990> join<00:04:33.460> the<00:04:34.460> design

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
combinate where were you join the design

combinate where were you join the design
with<00:04:35.330> different<00:04:35.810> materials<00:04:35.870> this<00:04:36.470> is<00:04:36.620> where

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
with different materials this is where

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.370 
with different materials this is where
we<00:04:36.919> usually<00:04:37.520> see<00:04:37.910> where<00:04:38.060> the<00:04:38.180> failure<00:04:38.570> is<00:04:38.810> you

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
we usually see where the failure is you

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.610 
we usually see where the failure is you
can<00:04:39.560> print<00:04:39.979> everything<00:04:40.280> in<00:04:40.550> one<00:04:40.760> shot<00:04:40.990> then<00:04:41.990> it

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
can print everything in one shot then it

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:56.490 
can print everything in one shot then it
would<00:04:42.770> be<00:04:42.800> a<00:04:42.950> great<00:04:43.250> advantage<00:04:43.520> across
