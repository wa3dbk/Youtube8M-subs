00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
battlefield 3 it has the quick firing

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.280 
battlefield 3 it has the quick firing

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
rate of the m40a5 but it also has a very

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.830 
rate of the m40a5 but it also has a very

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
bullet drop and shorter travel times so

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.539 
bullet drop and shorter travel times so
I<00:01:48.869> find<00:01:49.170> myself<00:01:49.229> hitting<00:01:49.740> my<00:01:49.950> targets<00:01:50.369> more

bolt actions in this game and as a
result<00:01:59.399> I've<00:01:59.700> been<00:01:59.820> having<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.090> lot<00:02:00.210> of<00:02:00.270> fun

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
result I've been having a lot of fun

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.810 
result I've been having a lot of fun
using<00:02:00.899> this<00:02:01.020> weapon<00:02:01.259> in<00:02:01.610> situations<00:02:02.610> that<00:02:02.700> I

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
using this weapon in situations that I

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.480 
using this weapon in situations that I
would<00:02:03.180> normally<00:02:03.810> not<00:02:04.290> even<00:02:04.710> get<00:02:04.890> myself<00:02:05.040> into

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
would normally not even get myself into

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.059 
would normally not even get myself into
due<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:07.140> limitations<00:02:07.500> of<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.890> bolt

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
due to the limitations of the bolt

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.660 
due to the limitations of the bolt
actions<00:02:08.489> in<00:02:08.640> battlefield<00:02:09.270> 3<00:02:09.770> so<00:02:10.770> do<00:02:11.280> i<00:02:11.310> like

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
other bolt actions in this game that

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.449 
other bolt actions in this game that
it's<00:02:33.269> just<00:02:33.510> impossible<00:02:33.900> to<00:02:34.290> ignore<00:02:34.440> not<00:02:35.280> to

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
it's just impossible to ignore not to

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.270 
it's just impossible to ignore not to
mention<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:35.819> fact<00:02:35.970> that<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.269> m<00:02:36.360> 98<00:02:36.569> be<00:02:37.019> does<00:02:37.950> a

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
mention the fact that the m 98 be does a

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.720 
mention the fact that the m 98 be does a
ton<00:02:38.760> more<00:02:38.970> damage<00:02:39.420> in<00:02:39.630> every<00:02:40.380> situation<00:02:40.730> when

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
ton more damage in every situation when

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.550 
ton more damage in every situation when
compared<00:02:42.180> to<00:02:42.390> the<00:02:42.569> other<00:02:42.720> bolt<00:02:42.959> actions<00:02:43.410> in

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
compared to the other bolt actions in

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.759 
compared to the other bolt actions in
battlefield<00:02:44.040> 3<00:02:44.099> so<00:02:44.640> if<00:02:44.880> your<00:02:45.870> enemy<00:02:46.019> is<00:02:46.230> even

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
battlefield 3 so if your enemy is even

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.979 
battlefield 3 so if your enemy is even
slightly<00:02:47.069> damaged<00:02:47.700> and<00:02:47.940> you<00:02:48.569> get<00:02:48.750> them<00:02:48.840> with<00:02:48.959> a

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
slightly damaged and you get them with a

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.229 
slightly damaged and you get them with a
body<00:02:49.230> shot<00:02:49.530> you<00:02:49.830> have<00:02:50.370> a<00:02:50.700> higher<00:02:50.940> likelihood

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
body shot you have a higher likelihood

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.420 
body shot you have a higher likelihood
that<00:02:51.600> you'll<00:02:52.019> actually<00:02:52.140> get<00:02:52.440> a<00:02:52.500> kill<00:02:52.739> from

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
that you'll actually get a kill from

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.160 
that you'll actually get a kill from
those<00:02:53.700> shots<00:02:54.290> so<00:02:55.290> for<00:02:56.130> those<00:02:56.280> reasons<00:02:56.400> I<00:02:57.170> you

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
those shots so for those reasons I you

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.110 
those shots so for those reasons I you
know<00:02:58.319> I<00:02:58.350> still<00:02:58.680> prefer<00:02:58.830> the<00:02:59.130> m<00:02:59.220> 98<00:02:59.430> be<00:02:59.790> for

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
know I still prefer the m 98 be for

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.870 
know I still prefer the m 98 be for
extreme<00:03:00.630> long-range<00:03:01.260> sniping<00:03:01.680> but<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:02.370> l<00:03:02.489> 96

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
extreme long-range sniping but the l 96

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.839 
extreme long-range sniping but the l 96
is<00:03:03.239> probably<00:03:03.739> the<00:03:04.739> best<00:03:04.920> bolt<00:03:05.250> action<00:03:05.670> in

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
is probably the best bolt action in

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:08.420 
is probably the best bolt action in
battlefield<00:03:06.450> 3<00:03:06.480> when<00:03:07.380> you<00:03:07.500> want<00:03:07.680> to<00:03:07.739> go<00:03:07.860> a<00:03:07.890> bit

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
battlefield 3 when you want to go a bit

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.820 
battlefield 3 when you want to go a bit
closer<00:03:08.880> to<00:03:09.239> your<00:03:09.540> enemies<00:03:09.690> or<00:03:10.380> to<00:03:10.650> your
