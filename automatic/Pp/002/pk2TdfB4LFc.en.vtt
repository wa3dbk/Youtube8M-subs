00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.950 

mean<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:10.920> thing<00:02:11.130> is<00:02:11.160> if<00:02:11.520> you<00:02:11.730> were<00:02:11.880> to<00:02:12.120> try<00:02:12.720> and

people are going to say what the hell
are<00:02:52.950> you<00:02:53.130> doing<00:02:53.490> one<00:02:54.180> egg<00:02:55.610> break<00:02:56.610> in<00:02:56.820> there

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
are you doing one egg break in there

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:05.060 
are you doing one egg break in there
what<00:02:58.380> we<00:02:58.470> do<00:03:00.290> give<00:03:01.290> that<00:03:01.410> a<00:03:01.440> mix<00:03:01.680> up<00:03:03.920> and<00:03:04.920> what

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
what we do give that a mix up and what

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.740 
what we do give that a mix up and what
we're<00:03:05.190> basically<00:03:05.310> going<00:03:05.610> to<00:03:05.670> do<00:03:05.820> is<00:03:06.570> we're

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
we're basically going to do is we're

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.290 
we're basically going to do is we're
going<00:03:06.780> to<00:03:06.900> dip<00:03:07.080> that<00:03:07.110> just<00:03:07.530> infinite<00:03:08.209> into<00:03:09.209> the

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
going to dip that just infinite into the

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.640 
going to dip that just infinite into the
egg<00:03:10.310> and<00:03:11.310> then<00:03:11.400> we're<00:03:11.550> going<00:03:11.640> to<00:03:11.700> pan<00:03:11.940> fry<00:03:12.270> it

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
egg and then we're going to pan fry it

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.840 
egg and then we're going to pan fry it
so<00:03:13.650> first<00:03:14.130> of<00:03:14.250> all<00:03:14.340> I'm<00:03:14.400> going<00:03:14.489> at<00:03:14.580> the<00:03:14.670> heat

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
so first of all I'm going at the heat

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.270 
so first of all I'm going at the heat
under<00:03:15.000> the<00:03:15.300> pan<00:03:15.510> and<00:03:15.810> then<00:03:16.440> we'll<00:03:16.620> do<00:03:16.770> this<00:03:16.980> in

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
under the pan and then we'll do this in

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.420 
under the pan and then we'll do this in
real<00:03:17.459> time<00:03:17.930> so<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:19.080> trick<00:03:19.350> to<00:03:19.769> cooking<00:03:19.950> fish

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
real time so the trick to cooking fish

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.660 
real time so the trick to cooking fish
in<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:21.060> pan<00:03:21.300> is<00:03:21.800> you've<00:03:22.800> got<00:03:23.010> to<00:03:23.100> get<00:03:23.220> that<00:03:23.340> pan

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
in the pan is you've got to get that pan

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.750 
in the pan is you've got to get that pan
really<00:03:24.630> really<00:03:25.620> hot<00:03:25.830> so<00:03:26.130> I'm<00:03:26.459> just<00:03:26.580> going<00:03:26.730> to

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
really really hot so I'm just going to

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.820 
really really hot so I'm just going to
drop<00:03:26.910> in<00:03:27.090> some<00:03:27.269> olive<00:03:27.360> oil<00:03:27.570> in<00:03:27.780> there<00:03:27.989> and<00:03:28.230> just

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
drop in some olive oil in there and just

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.860 
drop in some olive oil in there and just
gently<00:03:29.160> start<00:03:29.910> eating<00:03:30.209> that<00:03:30.330> through<00:03:30.540> until

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
gently start eating that through until

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.410 
gently start eating that through until
it<00:03:30.989> shimmers<00:03:31.519> writes<00:03:32.519> my<00:03:32.850> oil<00:03:33.209> it<00:03:33.330> is

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
it shimmers writes my oil it is

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.020 
it shimmers writes my oil it is
simmering<00:03:33.900> nicely<00:03:34.080> now<00:03:34.560> is<00:03:34.800> the<00:03:35.340> magic<00:03:35.670> trick

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
simmering nicely now is the magic trick

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.840 
simmering nicely now is the magic trick
you've<00:03:36.810> got<00:03:36.989> your<00:03:37.170> dusted<00:03:37.620> piece<00:03:37.860> of<00:03:38.040> card<00:03:38.280> you
