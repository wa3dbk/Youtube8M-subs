00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 hello girls let's start with i 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.600
 favorite of July after so much 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.679
 time returned to favorite videos 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:14.389
 the first favorite is this and it is the camus 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:18.900
 the chocolate marshmallow face mask 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:21.300
 or is a chocolate mask ea 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.240
 the marshmallow marshmallows not those 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.720
 that you eat not like marshmallows though 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.789
 I'm not mistaken means extracted from 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.420
 plant with which it was once done in 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.700
 marshmallow however it is one 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.390
 cocoa powder based mask is 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.850
 a powder that must be mixed 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:44.700
 to water to create your mask 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.649
 personal this is let's say the vote is a 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.600
 little more painful because it is a little bit 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.520
 boring every time you find the right one 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.469
 amount of powder water from 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.140
 but really mix the perfume a 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.719
 heavenly and the effect is spectacular 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.730
 informs me the skin the second is the 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.770
 it also hydrates the leak is 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.570
 really fantastic 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.600
 then second favorite is this if not 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.729
 I had already spoken to you about it and the 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.400
 lemon-flavored body cream 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.850
 and one we will have very light very fresh is 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:19.560
 very moisturizing leaves a fresh count 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.509
 of lemon than cream than later 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.430
 first with the chocolate wing always in the 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.100
 the real and less moisturizing but I think that 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.810
 let the deal be a little bit formula 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.280
 fit this more to your own summer for 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.159
 this scent of orange and less 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.590
 striking but hydrates the same or at least 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.900
 from the right of tradition 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.960
 need in summer so not many 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.340
 but it has but the right and obviously a hundred 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.720
 percent more erotic like all 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.549
 produced the real third product 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.729
 favorite that I liked so much is the 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:51.270
 pastel pencil in the sky coloring 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.620
 torquati snow make up is a coloring 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.810
 very very 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:59.760
 beautiful and a kind of turquoise and much 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.040
 beautiful is really intense even in the 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.750
 internal rhyme the only sore point like 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.280
 I think it's a bit at the end a bit all 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.780
 pencils but maybe this is a bit of 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:12.060
 more for a while and sticking too much in the 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.160
 part but therefore it does not last very long 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.830
 but the need to pass it is the color 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:20.070
 really fantastic other preferred 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.710
 this month is the bassano laura coesi 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:25.050
 mint and chocolate rumors 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.900
 the rumors crisis I think is one of the 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.240
 best brands of lip balm in eco 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.910
 bio of course I say obviously why 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.930
 regarding hydration 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.490
 especially of the lips because risk 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.890
 what a hundred percent more logical because 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.560
 it doesn't take me to create a neighbor 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.110
 all natural lips 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.870
 in the end, everyone is so happy for me 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:49.040
 the sony lips always go on 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:52.560
 natural the fragrance is fantastic 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:56.880
 I don't know any good heaven knows more than 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.800
 while the facts then when I put it up 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.140
 to a sensation it works feeling e 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.380
 a really cool feeling 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:07.290
 pleasant due to the use of 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.730
 mint then another favorite this time 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.890
 no concern we have bitter words 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.290
 beautiful and very very very much acne 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.360
 is a foundation of the blend of grass skiing 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.690
 as you know I am a make- up artist then 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.400
 I try a little bit of bottom 30 exceed different e 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.170
 this guy I had not tried it yet but 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.890
 I tried the fantastic one on one 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:28.200
 girl who was full of pimples 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.330
 but a fantastic result has covered them 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.930
 all in the sector and natural, of course 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.629
 need 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.819
 promise I threw it with the brush 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:38.250
 on the part he had to have various 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:41.010
 major imperfections on the rest of the face 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.370
 where he had no right place to 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:46.739
 uniform the complexion but is phenomenal 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.689
 really really good and great not 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:53.700
 have no sorrow for me the fact 

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:56.159
 that there is the former on ps 35 because having the 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.329
 sunscreen to put opportunities 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:59.129
 with sun protection is not the 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:02.340
 maximum especially if it needs to be done 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:05.819
 photos because it reflects too much 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:08.849
 light and you get too white in the picture 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:10.500
 so unfortunately to its own factors 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:12.120
 sunscreen because I think that 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.250
 a person who wants to put on 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.139
 factors that are lit up yes 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.340
 put on a competition cream first 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:19.079
 solar no need to put it 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.449
 unfortunately there is a foundation type 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:23.970
 this one is the only drawback test 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:25.710
 I have it if it's the same because it's crazy and 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.410
 it doesn't even cost much respect 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.310
 maybe on tint mica forevermark and super 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.639
 etc 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.729
 finally always of the blair leg the 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:36.599
 concealer that I use for dark circles 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:39.900
 power that I really found it 

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:43.590
 really it is very good this is in the 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:45.930
 35 coloration is like saying and soft 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.909
 however at the same time it covers very well 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.889
 the dark circles liked this too 

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:52.110
 it does n't really have an exaggerated price 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:53.400
 promoted the last two favorites don't 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.320
 he realizes that as usual when 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.300
 I shoot a video I never find anything 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:00.120
 they are still the essence of black pencil 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.530
 that the discovery was the same as me 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.810
 I use for brown but this is it 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.280
 very good also and then the lime for 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.900
 nails of the cross that are of the 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.550
 simple lines only that are very good 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.550
 because they have a part they are enough 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.900
 large and have a part with a grain 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.909
 a little bigger is a big part 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.340
 a little thinner and therefore I really am 

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:19.229
 useful and nothing let me know in 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.700
 comments your present remember 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:23.130
