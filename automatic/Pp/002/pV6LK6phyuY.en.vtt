00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
way so I think you he's vulnerable he

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.490 
way so I think you he's vulnerable he
ran<00:03:26.790> a<00:03:26.820> really<00:03:27.239> hard<00:03:27.420> run<00:03:27.810> race<00:03:28.049> there<00:03:28.350> and<00:03:28.470> I

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
ran a really hard run race there and I

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.130 
ran a really hard run race there and I
think<00:03:28.769> Gary<00:03:29.519> Stevens<00:03:30.060> on<00:03:30.209> firing<00:03:30.510> line<00:03:30.870> who's

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
think Gary Stevens on firing line who's

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.840 
think Gary Stevens on firing line who's
drawn<00:03:31.380> all<00:03:31.650> the<00:03:31.739> way<00:03:31.829> on<00:03:31.890> the<00:03:31.920> outside<00:03:32.010> the

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.360 
drawn all the way on the outside the
Preakness<00:03:33.239> he's<00:03:34.049> going<00:03:34.319> to<00:03:34.410> be<00:03:34.470> able<00:03:34.950> to<00:03:35.220> do

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
Preakness he's going to be able to do

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.979 
Preakness he's going to be able to do
what<00:03:35.579> American<00:03:35.970> Pharoah<00:03:36.209> did<00:03:36.480> he<00:03:36.600> can<00:03:36.780> be<00:03:36.870> able

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
what American Pharoah did he can be able

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:38.990 
what American Pharoah did he can be able
to<00:03:37.049> break<00:03:37.260> settle<00:03:38.130> watch<00:03:38.370> what's<00:03:38.609> going<00:03:38.790> on

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
to break settle watch what's going on

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.270 
to break settle watch what's going on
inside<00:03:39.390> of<00:03:39.450> them<00:03:39.720> and<00:03:39.780> then<00:03:39.930> when<00:03:40.799> he<00:03:40.890> calls<00:03:41.130> on

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
inside of them and then when he calls on

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.949 
inside of them and then when he calls on
firing<00:03:41.549> line<00:03:41.819> I<00:03:41.850> think<00:03:42.180> he's<00:03:42.510> the<00:03:42.690> horse<00:03:42.840> to

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
firing line I think he's the horse to

that would have worked against Amon and

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.550 
that would have worked against Amon and
that<00:04:31.320> next<00:04:31.470> time<00:04:31.650> is<00:04:31.890> confident<00:04:32.430> his<00:04:32.580> pulp<00:04:32.880> and

they<00:05:02.610> call<00:05:02.820> it<00:05:02.910> the<00:05:03.000> Big<00:05:03.210> Sandy<00:05:03.570> because<00:05:03.900> it's

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
they call it the Big Sandy because it's

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.100 
they call it the Big Sandy because it's
a<00:05:04.170> big<00:05:04.530> it's<00:05:05.100> a<00:05:05.250> real<00:05:05.550> deep<00:05:05.820> sandy<00:05:06.420> surface

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
a big it's a real deep sandy surface

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.130 
a big it's a real deep sandy surface
that's<00:05:07.500> real<00:05:07.710> demanding<00:05:08.280> and<00:05:08.520> I<00:05:08.960> think<00:05:09.960> that's

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:10.140 
that's real demanding and I think that's

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.380 
that's real demanding and I think that's
probably<00:05:10.440> the<00:05:11.040> most<00:05:11.640> challenging<00:05:12.180> of<00:05:12.270> the

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:12.390 
probably the most challenging of the

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:15.080 
probably the most challenging of the
three<00:05:12.660> but<00:05:12.930> you<00:05:13.860> know<00:05:13.920> the<00:05:14.040> Derby<00:05:14.400> is<00:05:14.670> right<00:05:14.970> up
