00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:05.980
 Seventh is a curtailed chord 

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:09.690
 formed by the fundamental third major 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:12.179
 fifth fair and seventh minor 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.420
 to build it we will start with the chord 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.220
 finger and we will put ring finger in fifth 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.670
 third fret string is the note 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.430
 fundamental of the chord 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.970
 of the heart in fourth string second 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.400
 fret is the third 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:30.740
 index finger on second rope closeup 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.989
 fret is again the fundamental 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.809
 the first and third strings are played 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:38.690
 to the air are the third and fifth notes 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:41.059
 respectively of the chord has the bass 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.510
 in the fifth string that is tread with 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:43.510
 the ring finger 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.690
 the sixth string should not be touched 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.690
 if now we put the little finger in the 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.480
 fourth string third fret the agreed 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.360
 makes us the seventh the third 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:02.090
 rope that the air was a sun has been 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:05.000
 become a B seventh minor 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.900
 of the agreed you should always fix the 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.610
 chords locating their fundamental bass 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.190
 remember the little finger is touching the 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.860
 seventh of the chord as in all 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:19.070
 chords is very important the correct 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:22.750
 placement of the thumb in this case hovers 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.750
 on the back of the mast 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.270
 practice construction several times 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.880
 of the chord to fix it with practice 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:36.670
 the hand will build the footprint in block 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.670
 remember to step on and relax 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.520
 ah 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.370
 ah 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.879
 let's see how we can move or 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:30.630
 transport the seventh C chord to 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:33.360
 length of the mast 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.460
 we discard the first and sixth strings 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.890
 that touch the air 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:41.640
 the fundamental note of the corde finger 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:44.370
 seventh is the do we move this finger two 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.040
 frets until stepping on the re 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.890
 and now we build the footprint of the accord 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.440
 seventh finger 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.810
 having moved all the notes the 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.959
 same distance up we have 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.750
 built the re seventh chord but 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:02.569
 careful we can not touch the first and the 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.870
 sixth string since those notes have not been 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:06.840
 transported 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.790
 when playing the arpeggio with the right hand 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:13.950
 we will stop the thumb in the first 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:18.000
 string and only sound fifth fifth 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.000
 third and second 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:31.330
 we transport the fundamental note and 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.330
 we do the same exercise in seventh re 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.830
 ah 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.250
 in the next exercise we will fix the 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.400
 position of the low in fifth and sixth 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:18.040
 rope and we will continue practicing the 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.040
 seventh fingers chord transport
