fade it at first using it I felt like

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:19.520 
fade it at first using it I felt like
this<00:07:17.640> is<00:07:17.760> really<00:07:17.910> nice<00:07:18.120> and<00:07:18.300> hydrating<00:07:18.870> it<00:07:19.470> is

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:19.530 
this is really nice and hydrating it is

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:22.400 
this is really nice and hydrating it is
it<00:07:20.130> does<00:07:20.370> have<00:07:20.580> a<00:07:20.610> greasy<00:07:21.150> texture<00:07:21.870> to<00:07:22.050> it<00:07:22.080> and

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:22.410 
it does have a greasy texture to it and

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:25.970 
it does have a greasy texture to it and
then<00:07:22.800> I<00:07:23.010> noticed<00:07:23.430> after<00:07:24.330> some<00:07:24.600> time<00:07:24.870> a<00:07:25.230> lot<00:07:25.860> of

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:25.980 
then I noticed after some time a lot of

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:28.100 
then I noticed after some time a lot of
these<00:07:26.100> marks<00:07:26.400> just<00:07:26.490> faded<00:07:27.030> really<00:07:27.540> nicely<00:07:27.780> on

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:28.110 
these marks just faded really nicely on

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:30.770 
these marks just faded really nicely on
their<00:07:28.290> own<00:07:28.470> and<00:07:28.890> that<00:07:29.340> was<00:07:29.610> fine<00:07:29.850> and<00:07:30.510> I<00:07:30.720> know

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:30.780 
their own and that was fine and I know

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:32.540 
their own and that was fine and I know
maybe<00:07:31.080> it's<00:07:31.320> because<00:07:31.470> I<00:07:31.710> already<00:07:31.890> have<00:07:32.160> oily

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:32.550 
maybe it's because I already have oily
