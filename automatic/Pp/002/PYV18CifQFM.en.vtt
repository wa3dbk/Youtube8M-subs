let's<00:04:18.450> get<00:04:18.660> the<00:04:18.989> glasses<00:04:20.570> because<00:04:21.570> he's<00:04:22.640> not<00:04:23.640> a

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
let's get the glasses because he's not a

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.790 
let's get the glasses because he's not a
scientist<00:04:24.180> without<00:04:24.270> his<00:04:24.570> glasses<00:04:24.690> and<00:04:25.260> they

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
scientist without his glasses and they

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.950 
scientist without his glasses and they

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
they're just glasses they just sit there

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.500 
they're just glasses they just sit there
and<00:04:35.220> let's<00:04:35.880> get<00:04:36.030> the<00:04:36.330> crowbar<00:04:38.090> the<00:04:39.090> infamous

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
and let's get the crowbar the infamous

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:45.190 
and let's get the crowbar the infamous
half-life<00:04:40.110> crowbar<00:04:41.360> and<00:04:42.650> that<00:04:43.650> should<00:04:43.950> just

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200 
half-life crowbar and that should just

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.469 
half-life crowbar and that should just
let<00:04:46.200> it<00:04:46.350> Orion<00:04:46.760> howl<00:04:47.760> there<00:04:47.940> we<00:04:48.060> go<00:04:48.270> takes<00:04:48.419> a

let it Orion howl there we go takes a
little<00:04:48.600> bit<00:04:48.720> of<00:04:48.840> wiggle<00:04:49.110> you<00:04:49.800> gotta<00:04:49.950> get<00:04:50.070> a

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
little bit of wiggle you gotta get a

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.790 
little bit of wiggle you gotta get a
little<00:04:50.340> bit<00:04:50.760> there<00:04:51.030> we<00:04:51.210> go<00:04:51.360> so<00:04:52.289> there<00:04:52.470> we<00:04:52.560> have

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
little bit there we go so there we have

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:59.600 
little bit there we go so there we have
the<00:04:53.210> crowbar<00:04:54.210> in<00:04:55.169> and<00:04:57.169> lastly<00:04:58.169> the<00:04:58.979> exclusive

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
right here we have the gum so let's take

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:03.590 
right here we have the gum so let's take
the<00:05:02.190> crowbar<00:05:02.550> out<00:05:02.580> even<00:05:03.419> though<00:05:03.510> I'll

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
the crowbar out even though I'll

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.960 
the crowbar out even though I'll
probably<00:05:03.840> display<00:05:04.140> with<00:05:04.470> the<00:05:04.560> crowbar<00:05:04.970> man

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
probably display with the crowbar man

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.510 
probably display with the crowbar man
