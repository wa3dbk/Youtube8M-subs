00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.089
 hello to all auto sport is delighted to 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.560
 find the dn w8 unique gt hybrid of the 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.780
 market still sold to date 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.910
 then quickly to memory that is three 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.009
 motors two electric motors in one 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.690
 big in the front a little in the back and 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.170
 a small heat engine a three 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.869
 turbo cylinders and the to develop 3 162 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.490
 horses for a weight of 1485 kg 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.430
 only it is already not bad 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.010
 thanks in particular to a central cell 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.080
 carbon and false chassis in 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.340
 aluminum then was how quickly 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.719
 she places herself in the galaxy of 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.700
 sports is a bit the question 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.430
 will land in a big file 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.780
 and different topics and especially we 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.460
 let's attack by the basics for 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.260
 we the pleasure of driving and knowing 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.309
 how are the fast facing the 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.149
 market reference 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.149
 the 911 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:00.520
 we end up on board the gts is this 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:02.860
 that overall the 911 gts crushes limit 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.199
 now globally she is in 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.640
 below the 911 gts but is not done 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.270
 pasque pascal has excellent 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.070
 performances 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.190
 we are around 23 seconds 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:15.250
 still dominates with the limit against 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.080
 22 2 seconds check for this gts in 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.729
 four wheel drive 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.750
 we have many more couples in the 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:23.190
 eight at low speed 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:25.869
 and still some noise an excellent 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.600
 excellent sound and 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.190
 mechanics still have limits it 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.610
 still has a few more aboard the 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.560
 gts through the noise revving 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.149
 that do not end but overall 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.880
 all the differences between the two 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:42.610
 done in terms of more typical behavior 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.040
 sporty having the 911 which is more gts 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.720
 so what we would like is to have 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.510
 limits with 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.300
 a better feeling of direction and a 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.860
 setting a little more suspensions 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.630
 firmed up story of having a life you 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.870
 sporty puzzles that can tap the 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.280
 best gt of the market after the pleasure 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.680
 of conduct we are now going to 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.630
 focus on the innovative aspect 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.250
 limit electricity which is very 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.720
 obviously important aboard this model 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.869
 and for that we will make a 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.370
 parallel with the unique sports 100% 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:17.500
 electric sold in France 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:20.080
 the tesla model s listening is silence 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.670
 total obviously the 100% electric 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.670
 and yet it works very hard 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.239
 and overall it's a very good 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.010
 surprise because of a strong march and 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.590
 of two had a well chassis 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.810
 balanced and for a bitch sedan 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.969
 of tons she's pretty agile so 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.109
 that's what surprises most then 

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:44.079
 Is it going to be enough at 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:46.150
 technology has dethroned the 18 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:48.579
 I tell you this right after 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.329
 a few small dynamic images I'm 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:51.329
 found in cities 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.230
 here we are again on board limit 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:02.349
 for the conclusion facing the tesla s 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.030
 this unexpected encounter then the 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:06.909
 tesla bluffed us by his behavior 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.829
 very balanced for a heavy sedan 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:11.799
 more than two tons and its thrust 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:13.870
 very fast is greater than 8 in mode 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:15.790
 100% electric it is necessary the p the 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.510
 specify 100% electric since when 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.280
 we move to the hybrid night you're in front 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.620
 now if there is a quick step 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.919
 advanced on the automotive market 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:29.739
 in the world because it offers a 

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:32.620
 plug-in hybrid and the possibility 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:35.319
 to ride in 100% electric tesla goes 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.030
 further because it offers 100% 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.849
 electric and autonomy going 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:42.609
 up to 400 km there I doubt a little in 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:44.199
 sporting use in any case is normal I 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:47.019
 think we can count on a little more 

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:48.819
 200 km carefree the biggest 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:50.739
 problem of tesla actually it's the 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:52.599
 reloading is his sword of damocles 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:54.430
 because you have to calculate all the time 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:57.489
 its autonomy to know where we are going for 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.530
 to be able to recharge lotto 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:01.329
 innovative side let's finish in 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.250
 beauty our folder with the big aspect 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:05.259
 tourism to limit for that we 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.759
 let's go on a trip with her 

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:11.620
 limit is she a good companion 

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:13.540
 the answer in video good the famous bm v8 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.989
 bmb 8 apr first is that it's a 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.789
 bmv bah yes yes it's a bmv even if 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.409
 she's not six cylinders did not 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:22.479
 completely a sportswoman but it's a 

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:23.420
 true gt the year has just surveyed all 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:25.220
 the creeks of 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.410
 from Brittany because we came 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.060
 look for the sun here it is a 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.120
 wonder is really happiness 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.560
 and then it feels like before 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.580
 guard then it's sure that a car 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.460
 hybrid it's not new 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:40.160
 bmv did not invent anything except that they have 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:42.500
 really do something at the top there we run 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.480
 behind they have they did something at 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.240
 top and basle has not only she is 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.880
 hyper modern and the hybrids and she 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.100
 is beautiful she is beautiful we have 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.020
 make a splash with this foo and she is 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.670
 good to drive she is beautiful to 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.830
 watch 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:59.560
 hat hat there we are we want 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.090
 to have a Bavarian passport because 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:05.480
 they do a little bit it put everybody 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:07.100
 in the wind bravo to know the 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:09.530
 verdict of this limit it does not tell 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.820
 we all the more numerous aspects we 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:15.370
