actually<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.510> pretty<00:00:51.660> simple<00:00:52.020> process<00:00:52.230> if

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
actually a pretty simple process if

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.869 
actually a pretty simple process if
you're<00:00:52.710> familiar<00:00:52.890> with<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.340> concept<00:00:53.489> of

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
you're familiar with the concept of

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.420 
you're familiar with the concept of
exposing<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.629> right<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.860> basic<00:00:56.250> premise

exposing to the right the basic premise

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.729 
exposing to the right the basic premise
involves<00:00:57.210> slightly<00:00:57.750> over<00:00:58.079> exposing<00:00:58.620> their

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
involves slightly over exposing their

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.770 
involves slightly over exposing their
images<00:00:59.070> but<00:00:59.670> not<00:00:59.789> to<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.059> point<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.420> clipping

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
images but not to the point of clipping

images but not to the point of clipping
your<00:01:00.870> highlights<00:01:01.230> this<00:01:02.010> ends<00:01:02.370> up<00:01:02.430> retaining<00:01:02.940> a

your highlights this ends up retaining a

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.490 
your highlights this ends up retaining a
lot<00:01:03.210> more<00:01:03.390> detail<00:01:03.719> than<00:01:04.019> if<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.290> were<00:01:04.379> to

the<00:01:32.579> second<00:01:33.000> thing<00:01:33.150> that<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:33.630> want<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:33.990> do<00:01:34.079> since

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
the second thing that I want to do since

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.069 
the second thing that I want to do since
I<00:01:34.470> I<00:01:35.280> mentioned<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:36.090> I<00:01:36.240> usually<00:01:36.630> over

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
I I mentioned to you that I usually over

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.289 
I I mentioned to you that I usually over
expose<00:01:37.439> these<00:01:37.590> as<00:01:37.740> much<00:01:37.890> as<00:01:38.009> possible<00:01:38.189> you<00:01:39.090> see

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
expose these as much as possible you see

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.030 
expose these as much as possible you see
how<00:01:39.450> much<00:01:39.570> latitude<00:01:39.900> we<00:01:40.170> have<00:01:40.350> so<00:01:40.619> I'm<00:01:40.860> gonna

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
how much latitude we have so I'm gonna

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.190 
how much latitude we have so I'm gonna
hit<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.250> J<00:01:41.490> key<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:42.329> I'm<00:01:42.630> just<00:01:42.750> gonna<00:01:42.930> play

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
hit the J key and I'm just gonna play

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.050 
hit the J key and I'm just gonna play
with<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.470> exposure<00:01:43.890> slider<00:01:44.159> here<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.700> see<00:01:44.880> how

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
with the exposure slider here to see how

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.569 
with the exposure slider here to see how
far<00:01:45.329> I<00:01:45.390> can<00:01:45.540> go<00:01:45.780> in<00:01:45.899> one<00:01:46.049> direction<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.710> how

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
far I can go in one direction and how

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:48.859 
far I can go in one direction and how
far<00:01:47.820> in<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:47.970> other<00:01:48.060> direction<00:01:48.210> before<00:01:48.840> I

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
far in the other direction before I

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.440 
far in the other direction before I
start<00:01:49.170> losing<00:01:49.320> detail<00:01:49.619> so<00:01:50.130> I'll<00:01:50.820> reset<00:01:51.270> that

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
start losing detail so I'll reset that

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.420 
start losing detail so I'll reset that
and<00:01:51.689> I<00:01:51.899> know<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:52.110> overexposed<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:53.100> so<00:01:53.250> I'm<00:01:53.340> gonna

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
and I know I overexposed it so I'm gonna

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.940 
and I know I overexposed it so I'm gonna
bring<00:01:53.759> this<00:01:53.909> down<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.180> little<00:01:54.299> bit<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:55.470> regain

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
bring this down a little bit to regain

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.319 
bring this down a little bit to regain
some<00:01:56.280> of<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.490> details<00:01:57.360> in<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.840> highlights<00:01:59.329> so

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
some of the details in the highlights so

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.690 
some of the details in the highlights so
the<00:02:00.780> next<00:02:01.079> step<00:02:01.259> is<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.829> add<00:02:01.950> some<00:02:02.189> contrast

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
the next step is to add some contrast

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.340 
the next step is to add some contrast
this<00:02:02.969> looks<00:02:03.180> really<00:02:03.659> flat<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:04.049> me<00:02:04.170> right<00:02:04.320> now

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
this looks really flat to me right now

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.980 
this looks really flat to me right now
and<00:02:04.729> that's<00:02:05.729> just<00:02:05.969> either<00:02:06.299> a<00:02:06.360> matter<00:02:06.659> of<00:02:06.840> using

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
and that's just either a matter of using

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.010 
and that's just either a matter of using
a<00:02:07.170> contrast<00:02:07.710> slider<00:02:07.829> or<00:02:08.509> using<00:02:09.509> some<00:02:09.750> tone

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
a contrast slider or using some tone

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.540 
a contrast slider or using some tone
curves<00:02:10.319> and<00:02:10.530> there's<00:02:10.679> you<00:02:11.069> know<00:02:11.099> tons<00:02:11.459> of

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
curves and there's you know tons of

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.250 
curves and there's you know tons of
different<00:02:11.610> ways<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:12.060> do<00:02:12.180> it

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
different ways to do it

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.900 
different ways to do it
for<00:02:14.260> this<00:02:14.380> image<00:02:14.560> I<00:02:14.920> actually<00:02:15.310> just<00:02:15.730> use<00:02:15.880> the

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
for this image I actually just use the

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.990 
for this image I actually just use the
contrast<00:02:16.480> slider<00:02:17.310> sometimes<00:02:18.310> I<00:02:18.460> use<00:02:18.610> curves

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
contrast slider sometimes I use curves

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.970 
contrast slider sometimes I use curves
sometimes<00:02:19.570> I'll<00:02:19.720> use<00:02:19.750> contrast<00:02:20.350> by<00:02:20.830> use

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
sometimes I'll use contrast by use

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.440 
sometimes I'll use contrast by use
curves<00:02:21.310> I<00:02:21.490> have<00:02:21.640> want<00:02:21.790> a<00:02:21.850> more<00:02:22.000> detailed

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
curves I have want a more detailed

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.450 
curves I have want a more detailed
contrast<00:02:22.990> curve<00:02:23.290> or<00:02:23.740> I<00:02:23.860> want<00:02:24.040> a<00:02:24.100> very<00:02:24.280> specific

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
contrast curve or I want a very specific

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.700 
contrast curve or I want a very specific
contrast<00:02:25.210> curve<00:02:25.450> but<00:02:25.660> for<00:02:25.840> this<00:02:25.930> one<00:02:26.140> I<00:02:26.320> just

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
contrast curve but for this one I just

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.320 
contrast curve but for this one I just
went<00:02:27.010> ahead<00:02:27.070> and<00:02:27.220> bump<00:02:27.490> the<00:02:27.580> contrast<00:02:28.060> up<00:02:28.210> I

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
went ahead and bump the contrast up I

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.540 
went ahead and bump the contrast up I
went<00:02:28.480> up<00:02:28.540> to<00:02:28.600> plus<00:02:28.840> eleven<00:02:29.230> there<00:02:29.550> pretty

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
went up to plus eleven there pretty

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.060 
went up to plus eleven there pretty
simple<00:02:30.880> adjustment<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:32.500> next<00:02:32.680> thing<00:02:32.830> I<00:02:32.890> want

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
simple adjustment the next thing I want

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
simple adjustment the next thing I want
to<00:02:33.100> do<00:02:33.220> is<00:02:33.370> bring<00:02:33.550> back<00:02:33.610> some<00:02:33.940> of<00:02:33.970> the

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
to do is bring back some of the

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.910 
to do is bring back some of the
highlight<00:02:34.420> detail<00:02:34.780> so<00:02:35.080> I'm<00:02:35.470> gonna<00:02:35.620> go<00:02:35.800> ahead

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
highlight detail so I'm gonna go ahead

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.800 
highlight detail so I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:02:36.280> take<00:02:36.430> the<00:02:36.550> highlight<00:02:36.910> slider<00:02:37.030> and<00:02:37.390> just

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
and take the highlight slider and just

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.020 
and take the highlight slider and just
bring<00:02:38.170> it<00:02:38.290> down<00:02:38.320> and<00:02:38.950> I<00:02:39.580> ended<00:02:39.760> up<00:02:39.850> going

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
bring it down and I ended up going

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.910 
bring it down and I ended up going
almost<00:02:40.300> all<00:02:40.630> the<00:02:40.780> way<00:02:40.870> down<00:02:41.050> with<00:02:41.230> it<00:02:41.380> because

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
almost all the way down with it because

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.730 
almost all the way down with it because
we're<00:02:42.070> so<00:02:42.100> overexposed<00:02:42.910> and<00:02:43.810> then<00:02:44.350> I<00:02:44.380> want<00:02:44.680> to

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
we're so overexposed and then I want to

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.170 
we're so overexposed and then I want to
mess<00:02:45.010> with<00:02:45.130> the<00:02:45.250> shadows<00:02:45.640> I<00:02:45.760> still<00:02:45.940> think<00:02:46.120> the

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
mess with the shadows I still think the

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.640 
mess with the shadows I still think the
shadows<00:02:46.600> are<00:02:46.810> a<00:02:46.840> bit<00:02:46.990> too<00:02:47.170> bright<00:02:47.380> in<00:02:47.530> this

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
shadows are a bit too bright in this

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.260 
shadows are a bit too bright in this
picture<00:02:47.920> and<00:02:48.130> they<00:02:48.670> leave<00:02:48.820> it<00:02:48.940> feeling<00:02:49.209> a

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
picture and they leave it feeling a

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.390 
picture and they leave it feeling a
little<00:02:49.330> flat<00:02:49.660> and<00:02:49.690> washed<00:02:50.050> out<00:02:50.260> so<00:02:50.590> I'll<00:02:51.160> bring

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
little flat and washed out so I'll bring

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.970 
little flat and washed out so I'll bring
the<00:02:51.520> shadows<00:02:51.880> way<00:02:52.090> down<00:02:52.270> as<00:02:52.450> well<00:02:52.980> I'll

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
the shadows way down as well I'll

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.540 
the shadows way down as well I'll
probably<00:02:54.250> go<00:02:54.610> down<00:02:55.060> to<00:02:55.390> I<00:02:55.870> don't<00:02:56.440> know<00:02:56.680> that

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
probably go down to I don't know that

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.590 
probably go down to I don't know that
looks<00:02:57.730> about<00:02:57.850> good<00:02:58.000> right<00:02:58.330> there<00:02:58.480> 66<00:03:00.030> and<00:03:01.030> even

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
looks about good right there 66 and even

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.600 
looks about good right there 66 and even
after<00:03:01.810> that<00:03:01.930> shadows<00:03:02.320> adjustment<00:03:02.860> I<00:03:03.070> still

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
after that shadows adjustment I still

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.300 
after that shadows adjustment I still
think<00:03:03.850> we<00:03:04.420> are<00:03:04.450> a<00:03:04.930> bit<00:03:05.410> too<00:03:05.650> bright<00:03:05.980> in<00:03:06.220> the

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
think we are a bit too bright in the

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:07.680 
think we are a bit too bright in the
shadows<00:03:06.640> and<00:03:06.760> there's<00:03:06.910> not<00:03:07.030> enough<00:03:07.240> contrast

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
shadows and there's not enough contrast

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.300 
shadows and there's not enough contrast
so<00:03:08.020> I'm<00:03:08.140> gonna<00:03:08.230> bring<00:03:08.440> our<00:03:08.590> blacks<00:03:08.860> down<00:03:09.100> as

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
so I'm gonna bring our blacks down as

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.160 
so I'm gonna bring our blacks down as
well<00:03:09.490> and<00:03:10.270> this<00:03:10.600> is<00:03:10.750> where<00:03:10.870> we're<00:03:10.990> gonna<00:03:11.050> start

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
well and this is where we're gonna start

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.620 
well and this is where we're gonna start
getting<00:03:11.650> some<00:03:11.860> of<00:03:11.890> that<00:03:12.209> shadow<00:03:13.209> clipping

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
getting some of that shadow clipping

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:14.880 
getting some of that shadow clipping
over<00:03:13.840> there<00:03:13.959> on<00:03:14.050> the<00:03:14.140> left<00:03:14.380> but<00:03:14.560> this<00:03:14.680> is<00:03:14.770> also

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
over there on the left but this is also

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.260 
over there on the left but this is also
gonna<00:03:15.070> start<00:03:15.340> to<00:03:15.430> give<00:03:15.550> us<00:03:15.640> some<00:03:15.790> of<00:03:15.820> that<00:03:15.910> gory

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
gonna start to give us some of that gory

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.870 
gonna start to give us some of that gory
look<00:03:16.540> that<00:03:16.780> I<00:03:16.810> really<00:03:17.080> like<00:03:17.260> I<00:03:18.040> think<00:03:18.250> la<00:03:18.730> is

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
look that I really like I think la is

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.250 
look that I really like I think la is
kind<00:03:19.090> of<00:03:19.150> a<00:03:19.239> dirty<00:03:19.420> gritty<00:03:19.750> city<00:03:20.050> and<00:03:20.200> I

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
kind of a dirty gritty city and I

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.420 
kind of a dirty gritty city and I
definitely<00:03:20.590> want<00:03:20.890> to<00:03:20.950> show<00:03:21.130> that<00:03:21.250> in<00:03:21.370> the

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
definitely want to show that in the

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.910 
definitely want to show that in the
photo<00:03:21.840> the<00:03:22.840> next<00:03:23.110> step<00:03:23.260> to<00:03:23.380> bring<00:03:23.560> in<00:03:23.680> more<00:03:23.800> of

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
photo the next step to bring in more of

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.560 
photo the next step to bring in more of
that<00:03:24.010> gory<00:03:24.370> kind<00:03:24.670> of<00:03:24.790> feel<00:03:24.940> and<00:03:25.060> look<00:03:25.239> is<00:03:25.450> to

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
that gory kind of feel and look is to

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.199 
that gory kind of feel and look is to
add<00:03:25.690> some<00:03:25.870> clarity<00:03:26.550> this<00:03:27.550> is<00:03:27.700> gonna<00:03:27.850> kind<00:03:28.060> of

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
add some clarity this is gonna kind of

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.229 
add some clarity this is gonna kind of
give<00:03:28.870> some<00:03:29.070> sharpening<00:03:30.070> and<00:03:30.370> some<00:03:30.670> mid

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
give some sharpening and some mid

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:32.759 
give some sharpening and some mid
contrast<00:03:31.780> in<00:03:31.959> the<00:03:32.050> image<00:03:32.080> and<00:03:32.590> it's

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
contrast in the image and it's

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:34.080 
contrast in the image and it's
definitely<00:03:33.010> gonna<00:03:33.160> give<00:03:33.670> it<00:03:33.760> a<00:03:33.820> little<00:03:34.000> more

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
definitely gonna give it a little more

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.910 
definitely gonna give it a little more
separation<00:03:34.360> and<00:03:34.989> thin<00:03:35.500> out<00:03:35.590> some<00:03:35.620> of<00:03:35.890> that

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
separation and thin out some of that

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.430 
separation and thin out some of that
haze<00:03:36.190> in<00:03:36.459> there<00:03:36.610> so<00:03:36.850> I'll<00:03:37.660> go<00:03:37.810> pretty<00:03:38.050> hard<00:03:38.320> on

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
haze in there so I'll go pretty hard on

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.199 
haze in there so I'll go pretty hard on
this<00:03:38.560> I'll<00:03:38.769> bring<00:03:38.920> it<00:03:39.040> up<00:03:39.100> to<00:03:39.280> like<00:03:39.459> you<00:03:39.880> know<00:03:40.000> I

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
this I'll bring it up to like you know I

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:44.780 
this I'll bring it up to like you know I
think<00:03:40.660> 60<00:03:41.440> or<00:03:41.590> 59<00:03:41.980> here<00:03:42.160> looks<00:03:42.370> about<00:03:42.580> good<00:03:43.290> and

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
think 60 or 59 here looks about good and

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.520 
think 60 or 59 here looks about good and
I<00:03:45.790> mean<00:03:45.940> if<00:03:46.209> I<00:03:46.360> switch<00:03:46.660> back<00:03:46.900> I<00:03:47.110> just<00:03:47.290> hit<00:03:47.410> the

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
I mean if I switch back I just hit the

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.110 
I mean if I switch back I just hit the
backslash<00:03:47.860> key<00:03:48.190> and<00:03:48.340> see<00:03:48.489> where<00:03:48.640> we<00:03:48.760> came<00:03:48.910> from

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
backslash key and see where we came from

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.680 
backslash key and see where we came from
this<00:03:49.330> pretty<00:03:50.019> huge<00:03:50.440> improvement<00:03:51.030> and<00:03:52.030> I<00:03:52.510> can

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
this pretty huge improvement and I can

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.780 
this pretty huge improvement and I can
play<00:03:52.900> with<00:03:52.930> the<00:03:53.230> the<00:03:53.769> black<00:03:53.980> and<00:03:54.010> white<00:03:54.310> mixer

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
play with the the black and white mixer

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.020 
play with the the black and white mixer
I<00:03:55.030> often<00:03:55.720> do<00:03:55.900> but<00:03:56.560> in<00:03:57.190> this<00:03:57.370> particular<00:03:57.880> image

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
I often do but in this particular image

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.490 
I often do but in this particular image
I<00:03:58.239> remember<00:03:58.480> when<00:03:58.600> I<00:03:58.630> was<00:03:58.720> editing<00:03:59.049> it<00:03:59.170> it's

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
I remember when I was editing it it's

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.009 
I remember when I was editing it it's
already<00:03:59.860> soda<00:04:00.220> saturated<00:04:00.790> and<00:04:00.910> flat<00:04:01.150> that

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
already soda saturated and flat that

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:03.360 
already soda saturated and flat that
plane<00:04:02.260> that<00:04:02.290> this<00:04:02.560> just<00:04:02.769> kind<00:04:02.950> of<00:04:03.040> made<00:04:03.250> the

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
plane that this just kind of made the

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.310 
plane that this just kind of made the
image<00:04:03.549> a<00:04:03.610> little<00:04:03.640> blotchy<00:04:04.060> so<00:04:04.480> I<00:04:04.690> didn't<00:04:05.260> do

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
image a little blotchy so I didn't do

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.020 
image a little blotchy so I didn't do
too<00:04:05.470> much<00:04:05.590> with<00:04:05.739> it<00:04:05.799> here<00:04:06.160> you<00:04:06.640> can<00:04:06.820> grab<00:04:06.940> it

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
too much with it here you can grab it

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.310 
too much with it here you can grab it
and<00:04:07.239> play<00:04:07.510> around<00:04:07.630> with<00:04:07.780> the<00:04:07.930> sliders<00:04:08.019> and

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
and play around with the sliders and

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.340 
and play around with the sliders and
everything<00:04:08.769> but<00:04:09.720> it's<00:04:10.720> actually<00:04:11.110> a<00:04:11.140> pretty

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
everything but it's actually a pretty

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.360 
everything but it's actually a pretty
good<00:04:11.590> look<00:04:11.769> there<00:04:12.040> so<00:04:12.400> I'm<00:04:12.459> just<00:04:12.610> tweak<00:04:12.880> it<00:04:13.060> I

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
good look there so I'm just tweak it I

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.920 
good look there so I'm just tweak it I
think<00:04:15.370> that<00:04:15.400> looks<00:04:15.610> pretty<00:04:15.760> good<00:04:15.880> but<00:04:16.269> maybe<00:04:16.750> a

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
think that looks pretty good but maybe a

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.770 
think that looks pretty good but maybe a
bit<00:04:17.109> much<00:04:17.320> so<00:04:17.709> I'll<00:04:18.010> undo<00:04:18.370> it<00:04:18.489> and<00:04:18.669> just<00:04:19.630> keep

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
bit much so I'll undo it and just keep

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.390 
bit much so I'll undo it and just keep
going<00:04:20.109> down<00:04:20.260> here<00:04:20.320> I<00:04:20.560> didn't<00:04:20.919> do<00:04:20.979> any<00:04:21.130> split

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
going down here I didn't do any split

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.589 
going down here I didn't do any split
toning<00:04:21.609> on<00:04:21.820> this<00:04:21.970> as<00:04:22.150> a<00:04:22.180> black<00:04:22.360> and<00:04:22.510> white

00:04:22.589 --> 00:04:22.599 
toning on this as a black and white

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:26.370 
toning on this as a black and white
picture<00:04:23.970> I'll<00:04:24.970> zoom<00:04:25.419> in<00:04:25.570> a<00:04:25.690> little<00:04:25.810> bit<00:04:26.080> and

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
picture I'll zoom in a little bit and

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:26.660 
picture I'll zoom in a little bit and
see

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
see

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:29.510 
see
the<00:04:26.820> noise<00:04:27.120> situation<00:04:27.630> looks<00:04:27.840> like<00:04:27.990> and<00:04:28.520> in

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
the noise situation looks like and in

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.950 
the noise situation looks like and in
this<00:04:29.700> case<00:04:29.970> I<00:04:30.120> think<00:04:30.150> we<00:04:30.450> could<00:04:30.600> go<00:04:30.720> for<00:04:30.930> a

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
this case I think we could go for a

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.170 
this case I think we could go for a
little<00:04:31.260> bit<00:04:31.560> of<00:04:31.680> noise<00:04:31.920> reduction<00:04:32.060> but<00:04:33.060> not

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
little bit of noise reduction but not

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.760 
little bit of noise reduction but not
too<00:04:33.360> much<00:04:33.510> again<00:04:33.840> I<00:04:33.870> kind<00:04:34.170> of<00:04:34.290> like<00:04:34.410> the<00:04:34.530> gritty

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
too much again I kind of like the gritty

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.410 
too much again I kind of like the gritty
grain<00:04:35.070> feel<00:04:35.340> that<00:04:35.550> we<00:04:35.640> get<00:04:35.850> but<00:04:36.060> I<00:04:36.090> don't<00:04:36.300> want

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:36.420 
grain feel that we get but I don't want

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.420 
grain feel that we get but I don't want
the<00:04:36.510> noise<00:04:36.660> to<00:04:36.900> be<00:04:37.050> so<00:04:37.680> distracting<00:04:38.220> that<00:04:38.250> it

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
the noise to be so distracting that it

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.700 
the noise to be so distracting that it
takes<00:04:38.610> away<00:04:38.790> from<00:04:38.820> the<00:04:38.970> picture<00:04:39.360> itself<00:04:39.710> and

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
takes away from the picture itself and

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.560

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 
LA and I love the the smokey kind of

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.110 
LA and I love the the smokey kind of
hazy<00:05:27.600> feel<00:05:27.990> that<00:05:28.230> was<00:05:28.500> the<00:05:28.710> smoke<00:05:29.580> resulted<00:05:30.030> in

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
hazy feel that was the smoke resulted in

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.610 
hazy feel that was the smoke resulted in
it's<00:05:30.210> like<00:05:30.300> kind<00:05:30.810> of<00:05:30.960> wanted<00:05:31.200> to<00:05:31.260> keep<00:05:31.410> that

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
it's like kind of wanted to keep that

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.790 
it's like kind of wanted to keep that
but<00:05:31.830> as<00:05:31.920> you<00:05:31.950> can<00:05:32.190> see<00:05:32.400> what<00:05:33.390> looks<00:05:33.750> to<00:05:34.020> be<00:05:34.650> a

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
but as you can see what looks to be a

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.740 
but as you can see what looks to be a
somewhat<00:05:35.160> hilariously<00:05:35.730> overexposed<00:05:36.480> shot

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750
