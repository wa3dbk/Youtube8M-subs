with a kite base and in order to do this

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.600 
with a kite base and in order to do this
you're<00:00:34.230> going<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.680> make<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.219> valley<00:00:35.520> fold<00:00:35.670> along

you're going to make a valley fold along
the<00:00:38.610> center<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.920> make<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:40.950> good<00:00:41.250> crease<00:00:41.670> for<00:00:41.940> a

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
the center and make a good crease for a

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.979 
the center and make a good crease for a
reference<00:00:42.390> line<00:00:44.300> open<00:00:45.300> it<00:00:45.390> back<00:00:45.539> up<00:00:45.600> and

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
reference line open it back up and

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.850 
reference line open it back up and
you're<00:00:46.980> going<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.219> take<00:00:47.460> each<00:00:47.700> edge<00:00:48.000> here<00:00:48.420> and

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
you're going to take each edge here and

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.250 
you're going to take each edge here and
bring<00:00:49.860> it<00:00:49.980> along<00:00:50.480> until<00:00:51.480> it<00:00:51.660> meets<00:00:51.960> your

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
bring it along until it meets your

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.319 
bring it along until it meets your
Center<00:00:53.010> base<00:00:53.160> line<00:00:53.489> which<00:00:53.730> you've<00:00:53.879> just<00:00:54.149> made

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
Center base line which you've just made

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.139 
Center base line which you've just made
with<00:00:54.570> your<00:00:54.719> crease<00:00:58.579> you're<00:00:59.579> going<00:00:59.760> to<00:00:59.879> do<00:01:00.000> that

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
with your crease you're going to do that

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:08.600 
with your crease you're going to do that
for<00:01:00.329> both<00:01:00.780> sides<00:01:04.339> and<00:01:06.619> that<00:01:07.619> is<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:07.950> kite<00:01:08.400> base

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
for both sides and that is the kite base

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.429 
for both sides and that is the kite base
which<00:01:09.150> obviously<00:01:09.810> is<00:01:10.049> named<00:01:10.200> because<00:01:10.350> it

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
which obviously is named because it

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.020 
which obviously is named because it
looks<00:01:10.710> similar<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.159> kite<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.700> is<00:01:11.790> one<00:01:11.939> of

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
looks similar to a kite and is one of

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.340 
looks similar to a kite and is one of
the<00:01:12.090> most<00:01:12.210> common<00:01:12.630> basis<00:01:12.990> that<00:01:13.170> you'll<00:01:13.290> find

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
the most common basis that you'll find

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.820 
the most common basis that you'll find
an<00:01:13.650> origami<00:01:14.330> another<00:01:15.330> one<00:01:15.570> is<00:01:15.689> what's<00:01:16.590> called

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
an origami another one is what's called

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.850 
an origami another one is what's called
preliminary<00:01:17.520> base<00:01:17.759> which<00:01:18.560> involves<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.619> little

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
preliminary base which involves a little

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.429 
preliminary base which involves a little
bit<00:01:19.950> of<00:01:20.040> some<00:01:20.670> finesse<00:01:21.060> what<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.049> want<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.290> do

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
bit of some finesse what you want to do

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.289 
bit of some finesse what you want to do
is<00:01:22.939> take<00:01:23.939> your<00:01:24.060> paper<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.570> you'll<00:01:25.110> fold<00:01:25.439> it

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
is take your paper and you'll fold it

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.200 
is take your paper and you'll fold it
four<00:01:27.299> times<00:01:27.540> along<00:01:28.200> all<00:01:28.500> edges<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.759> all

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
four times along all edges and all

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.249 
four times along all edges and all
points<00:01:31.100> and<00:01:32.100> get<00:01:32.310> some<00:01:33.299> good<00:01:33.540> creases<00:01:34.079> in

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
points and get some good creases in

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.940 
points and get some good creases in
there

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:56.209 

now<00:01:40.950> just<00:01:41.249> fold<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:41.579> diagonally<00:01:41.759> as<00:01:42.270> well<00:01:55.219> now

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
now just fold it diagonally as well now

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.520 
now just fold it diagonally as well now
this<00:01:56.369> part<00:01:56.670> can<00:01:56.819> be<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:57.149> bit<00:01:57.420> of<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.569> trick<00:01:57.840> but

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
this part can be a bit of a trick but

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.669 
this part can be a bit of a trick but
what<00:01:59.039> you<00:01:59.130> want<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.340> do<00:01:59.490> is<00:01:59.689> grab<00:02:00.689> here<00:02:01.200> right

00:02:01.669 --> 00:02:01.679 
what you want to do is grab here right

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:05.359 
what you want to do is grab here right
along<00:02:02.209> these<00:02:03.209> two<00:02:03.770> crease<00:02:04.770> lines<00:02:05.069> that<00:02:05.280> you

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
along these two crease lines that you

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.029 
along these two crease lines that you
just<00:02:05.549> made<00:02:05.819> and<00:02:06.119> you're<00:02:07.049> just<00:02:07.259> going<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.770> bring

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
just made and you're just going to bring

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.919 
just made and you're just going to bring
this<00:02:08.250> in<00:02:08.549> until<00:02:09.000> it<00:02:09.090> makes<00:02:09.239> sort<00:02:09.509> of<00:02:09.569> a<00:02:09.629> pyramid

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
this in until it makes sort of a pyramid

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:17.720 
this in until it makes sort of a pyramid
shape<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:11.420> you'll<00:02:12.420> fold<00:02:12.810> it<00:02:13.049> down<00:02:14.569> and<00:02:16.730> that

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
shape and you'll fold it down and that

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.440 
shape and you'll fold it down and that
is<00:02:18.030> a<00:02:18.390> preliminary<00:02:19.049> base
