00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.960
 sweet 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.639
 faithful compliant buddy it's all right 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.420
 But don't think the Swiss 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.380
 White Shepherd 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:16.250
 what you are mireille is going to be with chicken 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.250
 search floor 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.770
 but all rooms are the true 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.820
 are empty but still completely 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.070
 intact 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.270
 so the doors are still one of the windows 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.160
 are not yet 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:35.989
 and there is someone missing and going 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:38.030
 chicken dust and settle for us on 22nd 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.580
 have been trained on sit and the 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.710
 people who are lying and hanging 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.600
 are in any area 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.750
 well you see that dog that has the real one 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.790
 clear sense of action and him at all 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.970
 smells like those here 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.440
 traces and what he does is i want that 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.030
 turn and see what he does with 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.720
 his leg he just wanted to get through 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.720
 entirely right 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:07.610
 he saw his head go up that was true 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.610
 beautiful you know have the exact figure 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:32.600
 10 placement is the fall is I got you 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.600
 found it 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.240
 he saw that chicken and the corridor monique 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.770
 allowed to turn very well did was first 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.930
 walk all the way to the end of the corridor 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.780
 and then come back so he dog all that 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.340
 can absorb the odor that hangs in that corridor 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.260
 because that starts with seeing that sometimes 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.729
 Grab that dog odor 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.990
 it's all about the reward it's whole 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.700
 important now if it has found 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:01.380
 it's all about doing the rewards there 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:03.360
 ie it for the games and often in two 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.970
 situations we let the object you 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.700
 with around so that he knows who 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.280
 I have to be there it's nice 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.680
 that is handsome and the reward is always or 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.300
 feed or a game or a hug from 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.860
 the boss but there is no dog who 's 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.910
 morning think then I go them this morning 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.530
 save people 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.910
 so they are already doing it for something else 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.459
 the use of the nose is actually the 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.620
 most intense way for a dog to 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.120
 work and fifteen minutes of searching 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.400
 actually my hour next to the bike 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.620
 but even more important 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.760
 to know that through the dog 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.769
 smell actually picks up by mouth and that 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.300
 that he actually also had odor and 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.640
 there would be of that is to moisten 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.320
 from the mouth so important that they 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.970
 can pick up a new fragrance 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.500
 so it just cost them a whole lot 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.180
 lots of energy and 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.660
 and and the but not just 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.660
 dry out
