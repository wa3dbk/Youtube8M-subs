okay<00:00:08.350> we're<00:00:08.559> going<00:00:08.680> to<00:00:08.740> talk<00:00:08.950> about<00:00:09.100> the

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:09.400 
okay we're going to talk about the

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.039 
okay we're going to talk about the
Chinese<00:00:09.639> scale<00:00:10.889> it<00:00:11.889> is<00:00:12.610> a<00:00:12.670> five<00:00:13.120> tone<00:00:13.450> of<00:00:13.719> five

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:14.049 
Chinese scale it is a five tone of five

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:16.150 
Chinese scale it is a five tone of five
note<00:00:14.350> scale

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160 
note scale

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.210 
note scale
starting<00:00:16.939> from<00:00:17.089> the<00:00:17.269> root<00:00:18.640> the<00:00:19.640> formula<00:00:20.179> is

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.220 
starting from the root the formula is

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.339 
starting from the root the formula is
between<00:00:22.220> the<00:00:22.489> third<00:00:22.759> and<00:00:22.789> the<00:00:23.720> fourth<00:00:24.050> step

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:24.349 
between the third and the fourth step

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:27.720 
between the third and the fourth step
you<00:00:25.220> need<00:00:25.369> a<00:00:25.579> whole<00:00:25.789> and<00:00:26.029> half<00:00:26.180> step<00:00:26.480> apart

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 
you need a whole and half step apart

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.069 
you need a whole and half step apart
okay<00:00:28.730> let's<00:00:29.449> start<00:00:29.689> with<00:00:30.489> the<00:00:31.489> C<00:00:31.930> applied<00:00:32.930> it

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
okay let's start with the C applied it

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:35.439 
okay let's start with the C applied it
to<00:00:33.110> the<00:00:33.379> 12q<00:00:33.890> let's<00:00:34.370> start<00:00:34.610> with<00:00:34.760> the<00:00:34.879> C<00:00:35.120> okay

00:00:35.439 --> 00:00:35.449 
to the 12q let's start with the C okay

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:40.329 
to the 12q let's start with the C okay
right<00:00:36.140> now<00:00:36.320> you<00:00:36.379> see<00:00:36.530> is<00:00:37.190> the<00:00:37.370> first<00:00:38.470> okay<00:00:39.470> from

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:40.339 
right now you see is the first okay from

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:46.420 
right now you see is the first okay from
the<00:00:40.460> first<00:00:40.730> to<00:00:40.909> the<00:00:40.940> second<00:00:41.480> is<00:00:42.199> a<00:00:45.309> second<00:00:46.309> to

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
the first to the second is a second to

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.820 
the first to the second is a second to
the<00:00:46.460> third<00:00:46.610> and<00:00:47.089> on<00:00:47.390> the<00:00:47.510> whole<00:00:47.690> step<00:00:47.989> go<00:00:48.769> to

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:48.830 
the third and on the whole step go to

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:57.240 
the third and on the whole step go to
eat<00:00:50.739> okay<00:00:51.939> from<00:00:52.939> toe<00:00:53.210> to<00:00:53.320> 400<00:00:54.320> and<00:00:54.530> a<00:00:54.589> half<00:00:55.629> so

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
eat okay from toe to 400 and a half so

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:05.160 
eat okay from toe to 400 and a half so
it's<00:00:58.250> a<00:00:58.369> Gina<00:00:58.820> okay<00:00:59.619> and<00:01:00.619> then<00:01:00.860> a<00:01:01.159> whole<00:01:01.820> step

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.080 

of<00:01:06.280> five<00:01:07.280> dollars

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
of five dollars

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:14.399 
of five dollars
Gail<00:01:09.520> so<00:01:10.520> you<00:01:10.640> say<00:01:10.880> to<00:01:10.939> see<00:01:11.420> shut<00:01:12.409> Chinese<00:01:13.100> have

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
Gail so you say to see shut Chinese have

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:22.630 
Gail so you say to see shut Chinese have
C<00:01:15.409> D<00:01:15.680> E<00:01:16.720> G<00:01:17.720> hey<00:01:19.090> all<00:01:20.090> right<00:01:20.979> that<00:01:21.979> moves<00:01:22.249> to<00:01:22.399> the

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
C D E G hey all right that moves to the

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.120 
C D E G hey all right that moves to the
key<00:01:22.819> of<00:01:22.969> D<00:01:25.210> Chinese<00:01:26.210> scale<00:01:26.509> right<00:01:27.350> now<00:01:27.409> D<00:01:27.829> is

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
key of D Chinese scale right now D is

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.510 
key of D Chinese scale right now D is
the<00:01:28.850> first<00:01:29.179> whole<00:01:30.109> step<00:01:30.439> according<00:01:31.399> the

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
the first whole step according the

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.649 
the first whole step according the
formula<00:01:32.030> so<00:01:32.929> the<00:01:32.990> e<00:01:34.119> another<00:01:35.119> whole<00:01:35.420> step

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
formula so the e another whole step

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:38.109 
formula so the e another whole step
according<00:01:36.049> to<00:01:36.170> the<00:01:36.289> formula<00:01:36.850> so<00:01:37.850> it's<00:01:37.999> an

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
according to the formula so it's an

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.700 
according to the formula so it's an
extra<00:01:40.329> one<00:01:41.329> the<00:01:41.539> half<00:01:41.719> step<00:01:42.079> according<00:01:42.439> to<00:01:42.590> the

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
extra one the half step according to the

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:50.139 
extra one the half step according to the
formula<00:01:43.159> from<00:01:43.280> 24<00:01:45.039> so<00:01:46.039> a<00:01:46.340> and<00:01:47.499> then<00:01:48.729> 45th<00:01:49.729> the

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
formula from 24 so a and then 45th the

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:52.359 
formula from 24 so a and then 45th the
hosts<00:01:50.359> get<00:01:50.569> a<00:01:50.600> part<00:01:50.959> of<00:01:51.020> the<00:01:51.229> formula<00:01:51.740> so

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
hosts get a part of the formula so

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.379 
hosts get a part of the formula so
should<00:01:52.549> be<00:01:53.109> there<00:01:54.109> you<00:01:54.229> go<00:01:54.729> the<00:01:55.729> gate<00:01:55.939> Chinese

00:01:56.379 --> 00:01:56.389 
should be there you go the gate Chinese

00:01:56.389 --> 00:02:01.209 
should be there you go the gate Chinese
scale<00:01:57.369> let's<00:01:58.369> move<00:01:58.609> to<00:01:58.759> the<00:01:58.880> key<00:01:59.090> of<00:01:59.119> E<00:02:00.219> Chinese

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:01.219
