00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
up till you get a dough mix this is

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.540 
up till you get a dough mix this is
actually<00:00:46.950> frozen<00:00:47.520> I<00:00:48.270> made<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:48.960> whole<00:00:49.230> bag<00:00:49.770> huge

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
actually frozen I made a whole bag huge

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.920 
actually frozen I made a whole bag huge
bag<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.120> had<00:00:51.300> like<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.510> little<00:00:51.780> mini

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930

bag of it and had like a little mini
bags<00:00:52.170> here<00:00:52.410> so<00:00:52.559> that's<00:00:52.710> why<00:00:52.800> I<00:00:52.890> didn't

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
bags here so that's why I didn't

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.229 
bags here so that's why I didn't
actually<00:00:53.309> want<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.610> do<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:53.879> for<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.120> video

water let them boil for 2-3 minutes so
they<00:01:25.049> come<00:01:25.409> out<00:01:25.500> of<00:01:25.680> heart<00:01:25.860> consistency<00:01:26.369> they

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
they come out of heart consistency they

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.580 
they come out of heart consistency they
almost<00:01:26.640> come<00:01:26.880> out<00:01:26.909> like<00:01:27.119> cornbread<00:01:27.540> then<00:01:28.470> you

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
almost come out like cornbread then you

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.330 
almost come out like cornbread then you
let<00:01:28.770> them<00:01:28.979> dry<00:01:29.369> let<00:01:30.210> them<00:01:30.329> kind<00:01:30.540> of<00:01:31.070> get<00:01:32.070> some

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
let them dry let them kind of get some

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.310 
let them dry let them kind of get some
of<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.549> heat<00:01:32.759> off<00:01:32.909> of<00:01:32.939> them<00:01:33.240> then<00:01:33.960> throw<00:01:34.229> them

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
of the heat off of them then throw them

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.539 
of the heat off of them then throw them
in<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.500> fridge<00:01:34.740> or<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:34.920> freezer<00:01:35.009> I<00:01:35.340> would

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
in the fridge or the freezer I would

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.340 
in the fridge or the freezer I would
suggest<00:01:35.670> freezing<00:01:36.299> them<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.600> putting<00:01:37.170> them

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
suggest freezing them and putting them

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.109 
suggest freezing them and putting them
in<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.979> freezer<00:01:38.159> overnight<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.850> then<00:01:38.970> take

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
in the freezer overnight and then take

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.569 
in the freezer overnight and then take
them<00:01:39.240> out<00:01:39.390> there<00:01:39.630> in<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.710> cooler<00:01:41.040> so<00:01:41.280> it<00:01:41.369> stays

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
them out there in a cooler so it stays

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.280 
them out there in a cooler so it stays
nice<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:42.390> know<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.659> does<00:01:42.840> tend<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.140> break

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
nice and you know it does tend to break

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.719 
nice and you know it does tend to break
down<00:01:43.350> pretty<00:01:43.740> quickly<00:01:44.009> so<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.399> want<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.610> get

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
down pretty quickly so you want to get

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.030 
down pretty quickly so you want to get
it<00:01:44.820> on<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.030> hook<00:01:45.180> get<00:01:45.360> it<00:01:45.450> out<00:01:45.540> in<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.689> water

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
it on the hook get it out in the water

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.770

depending on the water you can change

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.880 
depending on the water you can change
the<00:01:48.960> recipe<00:01:49.170> with<00:01:49.909> more<00:01:50.909> garlic<00:01:51.149> more<00:01:51.509> cheese
