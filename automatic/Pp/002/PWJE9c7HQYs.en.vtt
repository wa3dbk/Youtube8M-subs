00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 Hello friends today for release 13 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.680
 headings original I chose the game under 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:11.719
 name gear ip either mushroom this game 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:15.120
 which is done in 7 days for the contest 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:18.539
 games that were made in 7 days 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.460
 I think that you understand me this game I 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.340
 real parkour simulator where we are 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.830
 play a man without a body with his hands 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.849
 which are presented in the form of balls 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.570
 white and yellow here is very cool and 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:38.250
 management is very easy 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:41.219
 there seems to be also a function here 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.500
 like clinging to walls you can 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:47.039
 cling to any sheer surface 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.079
 for example behind the wall I do not know the truth how 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.059
 it does however it is most likely from 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.610
 the fact that the hands are represented by these 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.890
 balls and by the way can be like this 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.340
 lift and can cling with one hand 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.350
 for example, this is how it is and that's it and we can't 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.519
 not where to go but the game is built on the engine 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.380
 unity which is not very bad because 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.610
 unity engine pretty powerful engine 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.820
 which you can really create 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.740
 cool projects of course you could 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.470
 create both on unreal engine and on edge 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.900
 endin but still and on unity is pretty 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.670
 nice to do in the game is present 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:27.600
 checkpoint system which is pretty 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:32.640
 facilitates the passage of this game oh her 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:35.130
 her s i am like this and the graphic fell 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.450
 part also does not suffer here just as 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.070
 I donâ€™t know what to rate here 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:43.020
 on schedule because here everything is very 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:46.770
 so standard is not here 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:49.259
 almost no textures but still 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.180
 the game is very simple again like that 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:55.740
 caught on the ceiling 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:58.680
 how do i do this so try then 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.909
 trick with the system and rise here 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.909
 somehow so here 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.459
 so here I got it now 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.650
 i need to get here 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:14.880
 in order to pass this game 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:18.850
 it is necessary to show some 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:21.610
 skills that you have acquired in others 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.390
 games and granny reminding also mirror's 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.670
 edge 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.459
 especially here by this effect like him 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.239
 runs it very much like not 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.209
 mirror's edge 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:34.050
 However, the fact that here I am clinging to the steep 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:38.160
 surfaces i don't like it much 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:41.650
 yayayaya money and yaytsy fire from there I 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.989
 caught up now gonna be all the same and again and 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.540
 jump on the wall don't know how it is 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:48.340
 it turns out but also I remember there was some 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.830
 parkour psp game 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.410
 I played it on the computer through 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.780
 some kind of emulator but the game is pretty 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.200
 not bad there was done in done 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.390
 pretty much all sorts of tricks 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.190
 here you can just say a game about free 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.459
 the runners are exactly like the free rainer 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:09.250
 just running passing and no tricks 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:15.880
 there is no special here except for jumping 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:18.040
 walls up to it is emptiness but so here's how 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.150
 see i fell now but lost not 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:24.310
 much much again caught the edge 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.170
 surfaces you can type smash 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:30.400
 in order to overcome pretty 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:35.049
 big pieces like that 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:37.810
 for example you can delay click on 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:41.470
 the space button to hold her and jump and 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.900
 even higher still and I do not want to 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.579
 now exactly fall because I think 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.780
 I will have to jump there again 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:48.670
 again for kosyachu 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.170
 oh well i seem to have everything 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:54.519
 ok it turns out so now it's the same 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:57.519
 on take run let's have all the same game 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:58.859
 It was created in the last 7 days, if it's here 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:02.190
 such a small bug that when you 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:04.330
 hang on the wall and struck pinch 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.420
 all the same 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:13.240
 sometimes it just sticks and you jump 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:14.520
 very low so in the game there and here 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:18.040
 some kind 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:19.959
 some spotlight shines yellow 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.680
 I don't know, I guess everything is correct 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:27.460
 did not and where do I need where do I need 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:29.560
 by the way here it is I don't know it was boom 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:36.250
 yes i play the game the first time maybe 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:42.850
 no need to jump there yes I guessed right 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:45.900
 so here so here you see me 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:54.640
 the space key is stuck again 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:58.990
 can't jump too high so oh 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:05:00.730
 oh oh yes not very good I 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.900
 I think that you can just like this 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:05.640
 jump onto the roof of this skyscraper and 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:11.050
 there already go 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:13.419
 see a cool game to kill 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:18.280
 time so called ie time you 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:22.630
 you can brighten it well of course 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:26.140
 the game weighs very little and it is not very 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:29.110
 a lot of gameplay the game is made speed on 

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:33.400
 passing on think this too all the same 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:38.080
 well I see that it is almost the end of the 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:44.350
 where it is not necessary and so now I will type 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:47.500
 overclocking and I think that this is who has 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:50.860
 I have fallen on the edge anyway I have everything 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:52.450
 it turned out the game is impossible to break 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.280
 because I think it would not 

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:57.520
 logical because as you can see me 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:59.620
 now it happened that it was to pass 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.060
 here's the skyscraper jumps over again 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.150
 the other one didn't work out 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:08.680
 climb up the skyscraper and what not 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:10.120
 very logical so can also spokes 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:13.420
 one hand for example 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:21.570
 jump somewhere in the side so here 

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:24.880
 so now i need from here so 

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:27.270
 now we need to come here 

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.270
 will show 

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:38.170
 5th eeeee main thing that I did not fly away 

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:43.810
 very easy I already pass this card 

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:46.600
 six and a half minutes I don't know how 

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:48.760
 passes this card other people however 

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:52.330
 I have already quite a lot of him 

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:54.190
 time this little card would be 

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.060
 cool if the developers did more 

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:57.610
 any ones 

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:59.470
 similar map for passing because 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:02.590
 that at the moment there is only 

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:04.720
 one version of the map and this one in which 

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:07.090
 I play the game I downloaded of course on 

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.770

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:11.980

 bronze medal yes it is pretty 

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:38.140
 I think a good result for the first 

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:41.620
 times all the same for the first time in this game 

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:44.170
