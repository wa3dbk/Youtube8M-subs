looks the reason why I kind of was drawn

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.630 
looks the reason why I kind of was drawn
to<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.590> initially<00:00:53.039> when<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.250> game<00:00:53.370> first<00:00:53.399> came

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
to it initially when the game first came

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.250 
to it initially when the game first came
out<00:00:53.789> just<00:00:53.940> because<00:00:54.360> it'll<00:00:54.750> remind<00:00:54.899> me<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.140> lot

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
out just because it'll remind me a lot

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.590 
out just because it'll remind me a lot
of<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.410> ak-74<00:00:55.890> used<00:00:56.309> by<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.579> way<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:56.820> looks<00:00:57.030> it

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
of the ak-74 used by the way it looks it

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.790 
of the ak-74 used by the way it looks it
just<00:00:57.809> wasn't<00:00:57.960> that<00:00:58.140> great<00:00:58.320> of<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.440> gun<00:00:58.620> in<00:00:58.770> my

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
just wasn't that great of a gun in my

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.650 
just wasn't that great of a gun in my
opinion<00:00:59.190> so<00:00:59.579> I<00:00:59.760> like<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.180> fact<00:01:00.300> that's<00:01:00.510> with

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
the three lane system of map which is

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.660 
the three lane system of map which is
great<00:02:07.770> because<00:02:08.039> there's<00:02:08.399> gonna<00:02:08.489> be<00:02:08.610> a

a<00:02:14.750> lot<00:02:15.049> of<00:02:15.080> the<00:02:15.260> map<00:02:15.440> speed<00:02:15.799> set<00:02:16.190> up<00:02:16.250> in<00:02:16.370> a

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
a lot of the map speed set up in a

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.009 
a lot of the map speed set up in a
traditional<00:02:16.849> three<00:02:17.000> lane<00:02:17.239> stylist<00:02:17.720> set<00:02:17.930> up

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
traditional three lane stylist set up

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:20.259 
traditional three lane stylist set up
which<00:02:18.200> you<00:02:18.409> can<00:02:18.650> say<00:02:19.069> the<00:02:19.340> fog<00:02:19.610> is<00:02:19.640> kind<00:02:20.090> of<00:02:20.150> in

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
which you can say the fog is kind of in

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:21.910 
which you can say the fog is kind of in
that<00:02:20.330> same<00:02:20.840> setup<00:02:21.170> although<00:02:21.530> their<00:02:21.680> guests

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
that same setup although their guests

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.070 
that same setup although their guests
are<00:02:22.099> technically<00:02:22.459> four<00:02:22.790> ways<00:02:22.970> there's<00:02:23.690> the<00:02:23.870> k2

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
are technically four ways there's the k2

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.479 
are technically four ways there's the k2
his<00:02:24.290> right<00:02:24.530> there's<00:02:24.830> the<00:02:24.890> middle<00:02:25.250> where<00:02:25.370> he's

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
his right there's the middle where he's

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:27.009 
his right there's the middle where he's
at<00:02:25.640> right<00:02:25.670> now<00:02:25.849> there's<00:02:26.269> a<00:02:26.360> cave<00:02:26.540> to<00:02:26.690> his<00:02:26.810> left

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
at right now there's a cave to his left

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:28.809 
at right now there's a cave to his left
there's<00:02:27.290> also<00:02:27.349> a<00:02:27.530> path<00:02:27.799> on<00:02:27.980> the<00:02:28.040> far<00:02:28.340> far<00:02:28.549> luv

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
there's also a path on the far far luv

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:30.729 
there's also a path on the far far luv
so<00:02:28.970> technically<00:02:29.360> it's<00:02:29.510> a<00:02:29.569> four<00:02:29.810> lane<00:02:30.019> but<00:02:30.650> the

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
so technically it's a four lane but the

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:32.649 
so technically it's a four lane but the
path<00:02:30.920> on<00:02:31.129> the<00:02:31.159> far<00:02:31.489> far<00:02:31.700> far<00:02:31.970> left<00:02:32.269> where<00:02:32.510> he's

00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:32.659 
path on the far far far left where he's

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:33.970 
path on the far far far left where he's
at<00:02:32.810> right<00:02:32.840> now<00:02:33.019> it's<00:02:33.290> not<00:02:33.349> path<00:02:33.650> a<00:02:33.680> lot<00:02:33.920> of

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
at right now it's not path a lot of

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.770 
at right now it's not path a lot of
people<00:02:34.190> like<00:02:34.340> to<00:02:34.370> go<00:02:34.670> so<00:02:34.909> usually<00:02:35.360> it's<00:02:35.540> kind

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
people like to go so usually it's kind

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.390 
people like to go so usually it's kind
of<00:02:35.810> more<00:02:36.019> of<00:02:36.079> a<00:02:36.230> kind<00:02:36.920> of<00:02:36.950> Morro<00:02:37.129> Bay<00:02:37.220> a

some Moab's he's got some really good

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.420 
some Moab's he's got some really good
gameplay<00:06:22.349> and<00:06:22.560> looking<00:06:22.770> at<00:06:22.860> the<00:06:22.949> because<00:06:23.190> he's

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:23.430 
gameplay and looking at the because he's

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.219 
gameplay and looking at the because he's
posted<00:06:23.849> he<00:06:24.180> actually<00:06:24.330> post<00:06:24.720> quite<00:06:24.960> a<00:06:25.020> bit

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:25.229 
posted he actually post quite a bit

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:26.960

though<00:06:25.410> he<00:06:25.500> has<00:06:25.680> slowed<00:06:26.099> down<00:06:26.310> over<00:06:26.669> the<00:06:26.760> past

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:26.970 
though he has slowed down over the past

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:28.520 
though he has slowed down over the past
few<00:06:27.180> weeks<00:06:27.389> but<00:06:27.510> I<00:06:27.570> think<00:06:27.810> the<00:06:27.900> reason<00:06:28.020> that<00:06:28.199> is

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:28.530 
few weeks but I think the reason that is

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:29.930 
few weeks but I think the reason that is
is<00:06:28.560> because<00:06:28.740> tons<00:06:29.130> of<00:06:29.280> people<00:06:29.550> are<00:06:29.610> going<00:06:29.760> back

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:29.940 
is because tons of people are going back

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:32.180 
is because tons of people are going back
to<00:06:29.970> school<00:06:30.150> probably<00:06:31.020> him<00:06:31.169> included<00:06:31.680> so<00:06:31.949> maybe

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:32.190 
to school probably him included so maybe

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:33.920 
to school probably him included so maybe
slowing<00:06:32.610> down<00:06:32.849> because<00:06:33.030> of<00:06:33.300> that<00:06:33.419> who<00:06:33.750> knows

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:33.930 
slowing down because of that who knows

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:35.719 
slowing down because of that who knows
though<00:06:34.139> baby<00:06:34.380> if<00:06:34.889> he<00:06:35.010> sees<00:06:35.219> himself<00:06:35.370> here<00:06:35.700> in
