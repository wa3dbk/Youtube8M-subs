00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:13.130
 hello again today i will show you how 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:18.700
 I make a blanket for dolls and so for this 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:21.320
 i will need fabric in general was a doll 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.539
 Well, and all the rest of the threads there and 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:27.830
 needles and sewing machines to tamu 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:30.080
 ruler but since I donâ€™t want to 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:37.660
 did not want to go for the line and decided 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:37.660
 take the maximum tablet and drew by 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:50.420
 Chloe a little bit with a stock looks like this 

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:52.580
 i.e. much more than chloe for 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:59.920
 that both boys and girls can 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:01:07.070
 it was taking cover was a tablet and 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:11.689
 other body so here now i 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:14.539
 it remains to cut and draw it 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:17.899
 more precisely about a stitching and how I do it 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:20.420
 I will show you now and so now I 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:24.619
 proceeded to typewriter and stayed for 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:34.310
 scribble here you are a long strip I put 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:37.149
 exactly on the tip and how I press and exactly 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.149
 field not 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:02.939
 so I completely forgot what I forgot 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:07.519
 tell what we do to him in general we 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:11.670
 do zen zigzag here this 

00:02:07.519 --> 00:02:14.519
 align the show and I would do that 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.580
 under the old skirt took Dita 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:21.680
 so that there slid and stitch further 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.680
 everything else that remains 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:54.410
 so in order to turn i needle 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:58.770
 straight inside 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:01.710
 I lift and turn as I 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:12.290
 need to re- put 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:12.290
 and raise and further line 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:48.439
 and so knit the floor edge of the seam 

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:55.359
 as you see i have proceq here 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:55.359
 small but cut so as not to hook 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:48.150
 and cut the strings 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:59.680
 Well, that's all turned out that's 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:04.060
 this bread and stayed ironed him for 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:09.720

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:09.720
