00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
we changed it up a bit and didn't work

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.440 
we changed it up a bit and didn't work
as<00:02:10.110> working<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.650> lights<00:02:10.890> at<00:02:11.580> that<00:02:11.820> for<00:02:12.390> the

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
as working the lights at that for the

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.810 
as working the lights at that for the
incident<00:02:12.900> maybe<00:02:13.290> in<00:02:13.440> the<00:02:13.500> long<00:02:13.620> run<00:02:13.730> you<00:02:14.730> know

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
incident maybe in the long run you know

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.380 
incident maybe in the long run you know
be<00:02:14.970> good<00:02:15.180> so<00:02:16.550> like<00:02:17.550> you<00:02:17.820> know<00:02:17.850> I<00:02:17.940> think<00:02:18.240> that

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
be good so like you know I think that

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.990 
be good so like you know I think that
code<00:02:18.570> will<00:02:18.750> go<00:02:18.900> down<00:02:19.080> as<00:02:19.610> probably<00:02:20.610> one<00:02:20.700> of<00:02:20.850> the

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
code will go down as probably one of the

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.900 
code will go down as probably one of the
best<00:02:21.210> videos<00:02:21.870> of<00:02:21.900> your<00:02:22.050> generation<00:02:22.500> to<00:02:23.370> him

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
best videos of your generation to him

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.700 
best videos of your generation to him
