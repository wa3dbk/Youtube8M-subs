mazzocchi on there with a goal of
stations<00:00:18.090> again<00:00:18.390> yeah<00:00:18.990> it's<00:00:19.439> going<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:19.650> be

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
stations again yeah it's going to be

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.500 
stations again yeah it's going to be
easy<00:00:19.949> to<00:00:20.220> see<00:00:20.699> when<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:20.939> photographers<00:00:21.449> are

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510

easy to see when the photographers are
taking<00:00:21.810> their<00:00:21.960> photographs<00:00:22.439> is<00:00:22.740> you're<00:00:22.980> going

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
taking their photographs is you're going

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.679 
taking their photographs is you're going
to<00:00:23.160> notice<00:00:23.310> it<00:00:23.640> coming<00:00:23.670> down<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.180> hill<00:00:24.269> we've

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
to notice it coming down the hill we've

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.960 
to notice it coming down the hill we've
got<00:00:24.930> basically<00:00:25.470> some<00:00:26.340> of<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.490> guys<00:00:26.640> wanted

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
got basically some of the guys wanted

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.759 
got basically some of the guys wanted
eight<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.210> slightly<00:00:27.570> longer<00:00:27.779> top<00:00:28.080> tube<00:00:28.349> so

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
eight a slightly longer top tube so

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.230 
eight a slightly longer top tube so
we've<00:00:29.010> lengthened<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.580> top<00:00:29.760> tube<00:00:30.000> on<00:00:30.210> the

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
we've lengthened the top tube on the

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.200 
we've lengthened the top tube on the
guys<00:00:30.480> bikes<00:00:30.859> by<00:00:31.859> about<00:00:32.009> 12<00:00:32.340> mil<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:32.820> to

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
guys bikes by about 12 mil and to

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.330 
guys bikes by about 12 mil and to
compensate<00:00:33.510> for<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:33.989> overall<00:00:34.350> aim<00:00:35.100> for<00:00:35.280> the

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
compensate for the overall aim for the

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.250 
compensate for the overall aim for the
bike<00:00:35.520> we've<00:00:35.880> shorten<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.390> back<00:00:36.540> ends<00:00:36.840> by<00:00:36.960> 10

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
bike we've shorten the back ends by 10

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.830 
bike we've shorten the back ends by 10
mil<00:00:37.469> so<00:00:37.620> I<00:00:37.649> don't<00:00:37.829> feel<00:00:38.070> too<00:00:38.280> different<00:00:38.840> it's

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
mil so I don't feel too different it's

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.540 
mil so I don't feel too different it's
just<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.079> yeah<00:00:40.230> bit<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:40.500> custom<00:00:40.860> tuning<00:00:41.340> for<00:00:41.489> the

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
just a yeah bit of custom tuning for the

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.639 
just a yeah bit of custom tuning for the
fact<00:00:41.760> for<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.030> factory<00:00:42.300> riders<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:43.440> just

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
fact for the factory riders and just

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.889 
fact for the factory riders and just
yeah<00:00:43.980> it's<00:00:44.820> good<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.090> get<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.270> feedback<00:00:45.480> which

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
yeah it's good to get the feedback which

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.299 
yeah it's good to get the feedback which
of<00:00:46.079> an<00:00:46.170> event<00:00:46.379> you<00:00:46.440> will<00:00:46.590> get<00:00:46.680> passed<00:00:46.950> on<00:00:47.160> to

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
of an event you will get passed on to

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.830 
of an event you will get passed on to
consumers<00:00:47.460> further<00:00:48.000> down<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.329> line<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.719> just

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
consumers further down the line and just

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.020 
consumers further down the line and just
yeah<00:00:49.739> we've<00:00:50.129> got<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.309> try<00:00:50.460> these<00:00:50.520> things<00:00:50.670> out

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
yeah we've got to try these things out

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.850 
yeah we've got to try these things out
we<00:00:51.629> have<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.809> 10<00:00:52.020> or<00:00:52.170> change<00:00:52.379> we've<00:00:52.530> done<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.770> the

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
we have a 10 or change we've done to the

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.189 
we have a 10 or change we've done to the
bike<00:00:53.039> is<00:00:53.340> we've<00:00:53.550> put<00:00:54.270> in<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.480> new<00:00:54.660> link<00:00:54.870> which<00:00:55.079> we

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
bike is we've put in a new link which we

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.299 
bike is we've put in a new link which we
were<00:00:55.320> running<00:00:55.500> towards<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.070> end<00:00:56.190> of<00:00:56.250> last

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
were running towards the end of last

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.119 
were running towards the end of last
year<00:00:56.670> which<00:00:57.570> allows<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.260> knee<00:00:58.530> oval<00:00:58.859> stroke

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
year which allows the knee oval stroke

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.549 
year which allows the knee oval stroke
to<00:00:59.250> be<00:00:59.340> more<00:00:59.520> linear<00:00:59.789> he<00:01:00.719> doesn't<00:01:01.020> ramp<00:01:01.199> up<00:01:01.379> so

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
to be more linear he doesn't ramp up so

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.410 
to be more linear he doesn't ramp up so
much<00:01:01.649> at<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:01.920> end<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.789> know<00:01:02.850> we<00:01:03.000> can<00:01:03.090> now<00:01:03.239> on<00:01:03.390> a

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
much at the end you know we can now on a

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.030 
much at the end you know we can now on a
heavier<00:01:03.750> weight<00:01:03.899> spring<00:01:04.290> which<00:01:04.470> keeps<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.860> bike

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
heavier weight spring which keeps a bike

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.130 
heavier weight spring which keeps a bike
sitting<00:01:05.339> up<00:01:05.519> put<00:01:05.760> up<00:01:05.939> right<00:01:06.180> but<00:01:06.659> allows<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.110> to

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
sitting up put up right but allows it to

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.960 
sitting up put up right but allows it to
give<00:01:07.320> its<00:01:07.470> full<00:01:07.680> travel<00:01:08.130> without<00:01:08.400> lots<00:01:08.729> of

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
give its full travel without lots of

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.850 
give its full travel without lots of
performance<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.630> we<00:01:10.380> can<00:01:10.530> use<00:01:10.710> the

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
performance and we can use the

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.350 
performance and we can use the
adjustments<00:01:11.369> on<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.520> shock<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.820> lot<00:01:12.030> more<00:01:12.210> as

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
adjustments on the shock a lot more as

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.450 
adjustments on the shock a lot more as
well<00:01:12.540> componentry<00:01:13.500> we<00:01:13.799> are<00:01:14.010> still<00:01:14.369> one

he's just uh providing you know he's
over<00:02:11.220> here<00:02:11.340> with<00:02:11.489> a<00:02:11.580> busted<00:02:12.120> collarbone<00:02:12.540> he<00:02:13.050> is

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
over here with a busted collarbone he is

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.780 
over here with a busted collarbone he is
still<00:02:13.440> giving<00:02:13.620> it<00:02:13.800> is<00:02:13.890> all<00:02:14.069> so<00:02:14.520> there's<00:02:14.700> a<00:02:14.760> few

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
still giving it is all so there's a few

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.729 
still giving it is all so there's a few
changes<00:02:15.270> on<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.510> team<00:02:15.720> and<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:16.170> componentry

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
changes on the team and the componentry

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.619 
changes on the team and the componentry
but<00:02:17.069> I<00:02:17.099> think<00:02:17.370> overall<00:02:17.879> it's<00:02:18.209> going<00:02:18.420> to<00:02:18.480> give

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
but I think overall it's going to give

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:20.510 
but I think overall it's going to give
us<00:02:18.660> much<00:02:18.989> better<00:02:19.739> performance<00:02:19.890> we're<00:02:20.430> gonna

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
us much better performance we're gonna

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.430 
us much better performance we're gonna
be<00:02:20.640> able<00:02:20.730> to<00:02:20.849> move<00:02:21.000> forward<00:02:21.410> dividers<00:02:22.410> are

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
be able to move forward dividers are

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.050 
be able to move forward dividers are
going<00:02:22.620> to<00:02:22.680> be<00:02:22.770> a<00:02:22.980> lot<00:02:23.310> happier<00:02:23.520> and<00:02:23.970> we're

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
going to be a lot happier and we're

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.550 
going to be a lot happier and we're
gonna<00:02:24.150> have<00:02:24.209> a<00:02:24.330> better<00:02:24.480> a<00:02:24.810> better<00:02:24.870> year<00:02:25.349> and

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
gonna have a better a better year and

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.080
