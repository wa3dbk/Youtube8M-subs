00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.109
 Hello 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.309
 Now we are going to learn some types. 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.440
 of mass 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.269
 Italy has more than 100 types of pasta 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.040
 and each of them has a form of 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.040
 cook in a sauce that can accompany 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.660
 we start talking about but the 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.800
 people have to understand the difference between 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.680
 the maximum to canon 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.140
 in fact the pasta is a kind of pasta 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.539
 and mass is everything we do 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.460
 that we cook is that normally 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.660
 just arrive on the cover 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.969
 So here in front of me I have 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.550
 some types of pasta and the pasta are 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.829
 divided into four shots in our 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.480
 long starts that always had in front 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.879
 at our expense 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.710
 these are smaller than I have here the 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:51.570
 stuffed pasta that is like a ravioli 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.969
 cappeletti and the masses in the way 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.649
 lasagna or cannelloni and some others 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.020
 types of mass project will also lead 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.120
 she to the oven to start 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.480
 to understand the difference she half holding 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.430
 but the long and short the greater difference 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.250
 between 0 and we talk about our 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.560
 that they are actually fulfilled 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.869
 they are 20 and 30 to 40 centimeters 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.119
 length and our short because 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.009
 they are small as the breast - 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.049
 What's the difference? 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.369
 When are we going to walk in a bit? 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.619
 cooking time 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.630
 but rather that the long mass, for example, 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.240
 people should never break elton before 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.860
 put on the pot are affected a thing 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.810
 totally wrong when we go 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.579
 need our long she already has this 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.860
 size because it's to be cooked 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.810
 could also do better with 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.509
 My memory, the little packet he does not 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.170
 there was a problem neither a broken mass 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.380
 It is for nothing so we can they 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.030
 internal 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.189
 when we use our waves to 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.250
 people put the girl to be a little 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.530
 more creamy sauces that will roll this 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.079
 and the short doughs can be 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.970
 many more pieces but with small pieces 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.860
 capers 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.310
 rain or other type of thing with a 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.830
 card is even if we can get together 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.330
 a good sauce with the correct batter 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.550
 we are going to make the intention that 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.560
 the difference is that each 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.600
 bottle you give you brings a little 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.340
 in the morning with a little bit of dough 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.560
 this makes the street belong to a 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.660
 everything much more pleasant technique does not 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.970
 finish that plate full of sauce in the 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.910
 background or full of apple while you 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:28.090
 Everyone ate a great difference. 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.820
 among the masses are the masses of 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.010
 Dried pasta and prey 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.290
 our selection really so more 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.660
 polka dots are masses you buy her 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.500
 durability and its validity, which is 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.330
 much smaller 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.790
 this is ours can also be made in 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:46.120
 you're going to do it basically with 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.430
 flour and egg and hard grain or 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.690
 are accepted in the same way as 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.930
 a difference that they go through a 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:55.060
 process is industrial and drying that makes 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.660
 with which the durability of it is very 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.490
 bigger 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.709
 the advantage of dry pasta because 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.690
 When you cook it, it usually does not 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.580
 if this is satisfied while the mass 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.110
 fresh it tends to save a little 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.630
 more between them 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:11.430
 and these are the main types of mass 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.430
 that we work our day to day 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.730
 and then liked that video then click 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.709
 down here I liked and enjoy and let 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.359
 your comment too if you have 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.439
 doubt lies below the 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:30.260
 comments we'll try 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:32.180
 clarify as quickly as possible and 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.439
