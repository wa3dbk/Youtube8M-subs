00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
have been the team's biggest skeptic I

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.110 
have been the team's biggest skeptic I
was<00:00:29.970> kind<00:00:30.300> of<00:00:30.420> prepared<00:00:30.840> on<00:00:31.019> finding<00:00:31.710> just

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:32.120 
was kind of prepared on finding just

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:36.770

haven't been able to explain what it is

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.440 
haven't been able to explain what it is
yet<00:01:21.990> alongside<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:23.340> mystery<00:01:23.880> there<00:01:24.299> were

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
yet alongside the mystery there were

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.210 
yet alongside the mystery there were
also<00:01:24.780> many<00:01:25.320> difficulties<00:01:26.159> we<00:01:26.880> looked<00:01:27.150> at<00:01:27.390> the

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
also many difficulties we looked at the

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.120 
also many difficulties we looked at the
hour<00:01:29.220> tide<00:01:29.909> computer<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.720> it<00:01:30.840> said<00:01:31.110> minus<00:01:31.860> 1

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
hour tide computer and it said minus 1

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.260 
hour tide computer and it said minus 1
degree<00:01:33.079> that's<00:01:34.079> pretty<00:01:34.890> cold<00:01:35.100> for<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:36.000> diver

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
degree that's pretty cold for a diver

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.580 
degree that's pretty cold for a diver
and<00:01:36.540> it<00:01:37.170> should<00:01:37.680> really<00:01:38.490> be<00:01:38.640> impossible<00:01:39.590> to

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
and it should really be impossible to

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.319 
and it should really be impossible to
have<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:40.950> cold<00:01:41.220> water<00:01:41.369> because<00:01:41.729> it<00:01:41.909> actually

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
have that cold water because it actually

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.880 
have that cold water because it actually
turns<00:01:42.810> into<00:01:42.990> ice<00:01:43.880> absolute<00:01:44.880> agrees<00:01:45.619> but<00:01:46.619> that

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
turns into ice absolute agrees but that

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.330 
turns into ice absolute agrees but that
could<00:01:47.070> be<00:01:47.640> explained<00:01:48.180> by<00:01:48.299> by<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.680> movement<00:01:50.189> of

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
could be explained by by the movement of

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.450 
could be explained by by the movement of
the<00:01:50.520> water<00:01:50.670> also<00:01:51.299> some<00:01:52.110> strange<00:01:52.649> phenomenon

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
the water also some strange phenomenon

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.480 
the water also some strange phenomenon
occurred<00:01:53.939> a<00:01:54.299> main<00:01:54.780> objective<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.890> dye<00:01:56.130> was

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
occurred a main objective of the dye was

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.090 
occurred a main objective of the dye was
to<00:01:56.700> film<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.180> object<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:57.869> yet<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.619> camera

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
to film the object and yet the camera

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.889 
to film the object and yet the camera
stopped<00:01:59.399> working<00:01:59.490> when<00:02:00.299> they<00:02:00.450> approached

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
stopped working when they approached

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.880 
stopped working when they approached
object<00:02:01.560> why<00:02:01.979> isn't<00:02:02.939> anything<00:02:03.299> working

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
object why isn't anything working

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.660

anything electrical and satellites whom
we<00:02:08.940> have<00:02:09.179> as<00:02:09.390> well

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
we have as well

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.860 
we have as well
stopped<00:02:11.770> working<00:02:12.340> when<00:02:12.459> we<00:02:12.670> were<00:02:12.879> above<00:02:13.690> the

stopped working when we were above the

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.009 
stopped working when we were above the
