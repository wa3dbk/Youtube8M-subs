 Ohm's law 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.330
 empirical physical law 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:23.060
 determining the coupling of electromotive force 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:27.130
 source or sang cross voltage 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.130
 conductor current and resistance 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:33.170
 isotopes 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:35.330
 chemical elements with the same 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.440
 I charge der but various mass 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.200
 numbers at the expense of 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.480
 different number of neutrons in the nucleus one plus 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.540
 tangent squared x equals 1 per cosine 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.930
 square x1 plus tank squared x 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:50.150
 equals 1 per sine square x-rays wai 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.010
 the speed of a star is a projection of its speed 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.320
 motion taxes view of the observer 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.300
 stars duality which can 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.210
 set only by nutritionally 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.180
 observations 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.510
 will open and spectral will be the main 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.920
 will be the evolution of plants has become a decrease 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.540
 significance and duration of adora 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.540
 last speaker species 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:24.640
 I was spinning in hysterics mom 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:28.000
 in the background, daddyâ€™s share in radius 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.760
 meters reigned cruel house when 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.210
 everyone understood the son was left without 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.900
 Mom screams diploma enough not to cry 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.870
 the beast 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:40.710
 I do not argue on 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:43.390
 listen dad i have my own wave and 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.170
 on its wave minogue 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.170
 to wait 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.930
 i died 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:56.270
 it is as I would consider it necessary to live forever and 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.240
 one day as usual I flew 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.740
 here 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.800
 I saw the sun then said to myself and 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.270
 6

 to wish for everything everyone who remembers me knows 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:49.510
 I was not so and therefore 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:53.349
 faces after all the map I wanted to see the color 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:57.160
 and how I would consider it necessary to live dreamed and 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:03:00.310
 one day as usual I flew in my sleep and 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:03.410
 the handset you hear the music, I said to myself

 I choose 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.500
 a and

 I choose 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.750
 i choose 6 to and 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.850
 and 9 and 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:26.250
 i would consider 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:27.580
 pros dreamed and then once to

 yes you have days 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:35.510
 what trouble the sun then stronger said 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.510
