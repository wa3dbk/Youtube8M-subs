00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.979 
only if I could only pick one fragrance
from<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.410> entire<00:00:40.920> house<00:00:41.430> it<00:00:41.879> would<00:00:42.780> be

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
from the entire house it would be

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.920 
from the entire house it would be
hands-down<00:00:43.680> French<00:00:44.489> lover<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.510> reason

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
hands-down French lover and the reason

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.209 
hands-down French lover and the reason
for<00:00:45.960> that<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:47.280> it's<00:00:48.090> extremely<00:00:48.420> elegant

00:00:49.209 --> 00:00:49.219 
for that is that it's extremely elegant

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:53.090 
for that is that it's extremely elegant
very<00:00:50.219> well<00:00:50.550> made<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.320> unlike<00:00:52.320> Musk<00:00:52.710> rubbish

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
very well made and unlike Musk rubbish

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.610 
very well made and unlike Musk rubbish
or<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:54.059> lot<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.690> others<00:00:55.020> from<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.320> line

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
or and a lot of the others from the line

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.260 
or and a lot of the others from the line
I<00:00:55.890> think<00:00:56.309> it's<00:00:56.789> probably<00:00:58.280> the<00:00:59.280> only<00:00:59.579> one<00:01:00.000> or

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
I think it's probably the only one or

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.529 
I think it's probably the only one or
maybe<00:01:00.420> there's<00:01:00.750> one<00:01:01.649> more<00:01:01.949> or<00:01:02.160> so<00:01:02.399> that<00:01:03.270> is

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
maybe there's one more or so that is

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.670 
maybe there's one more or so that is
signature<00:01:04.229> scent<00:01:04.619> worthy<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.479> I<00:01:06.590> mean<00:01:07.590> you

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
now I didn't think so when I when I

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.840 
now I didn't think so when I when I
first<00:01:23.250> got<00:01:23.790> this<00:01:24.380> but<00:01:25.380> this<00:01:25.619> actually<00:01:25.920> lasts

first got this but this actually lasts

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.830 
first got this but this actually lasts
to<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.020> day<00:01:28.170> after<00:01:28.619> but<00:01:29.060> by<00:01:30.060> then<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.540> becomes

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
to the day after but by then it becomes

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.929 
to the day after but by then it becomes
a<00:01:30.960> skin<00:01:31.259> scent<00:01:31.700> so<00:01:33.770> but<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:35.189> first<00:01:35.400> few<00:01:35.610> hours

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
a skin scent so but the first few hours

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.480 
a skin scent so but the first few hours
it<00:01:36.150> projects<00:01:36.659> very<00:01:36.990> well<00:01:37.320> now<00:01:38.130> it's<00:01:38.280> not<00:01:38.430> a
