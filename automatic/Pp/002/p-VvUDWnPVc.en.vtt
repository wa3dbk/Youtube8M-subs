00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 Hello to all friends today will tell you 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.430
 about the first four-engine Japanese 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.400
 bomber 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.469
 g5 n when developing this 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.440
 bomber main task was 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:16.100
 create a car flight radius which would 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.359
 was 5-6 thousand kilometers 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.520
 almost immediately it became clear that 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.529
 Similar machine should be exactly 4 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.119
 motor but japanese 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.039
 aviation industry had no experience 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.439
 create four-engine machines 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.810
 so when creating this aircraft for 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.730
 the basis was taken 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.649
 four-engine passenger airliner 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.120
 Douglas 10 4 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:37.200
 thanks to this the aircraft was designed 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.450
 fast enough 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.360
 based on the already finished aircraft 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.850
 changing his front glass 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.950
 adding bomb hatches changing target 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.739
 plumage full time to develop 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.360
 this aircraft was only two years old 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.239
 first flight took place at forty-first 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.850
 year and very soon it became clear that the car 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.739
 It turned out unsuccessful affected small experience 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.340
 the japanese are developing such big 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.640
 airplanes 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.170
 the car turned out perry heavy 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.770
 with the installation of new engines 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.310
 later on g5 m2 did not decide this 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.260
 a problem 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.240
 machine all was still very heavy but 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.479
 it is in real life 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.530
 and in the game if you were flying on ep-2 with full 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.299
 bomb load 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.520
 then you are not terribly hard to Nost 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.100
 aircraft let's consider the pros and 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.710
 minuses of this plane let's start with 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.140
 The first major advantage of this 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.659
 the plane has a very high bomb 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.170
 load the plane is able to lift in 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.869
 12,250 kilogram air bombs and 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.180
 pumping the car to the new pylons you 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.090
 you can hang 4000 on it 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.070
 kilogram bombs 250 kilogram 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.630
 bombs are the perfect weapon for 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.020
 destruction of ground equipment 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.759
 having them on board as many as 12 pieces you have in 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.689
 head can sneak in thoughts of 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.759
 generation of assets in 4000 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.280
 kilogram bomb very much 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.960
 arch day power bombs enough for 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.240
 not to take much aim 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.070
 and the amount of four pieces is enough for 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.670
 with one call calmly 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.660
 destroy 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.400
 large aircraft carriers 2 + have aircraft 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.880
 two twenty millimeter 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.730
 guns 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.920
 top of the top turret and back 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.770
 parts of the aircraft with the upper turret 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.080
 spinning 360 degrees covering up as 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:25.170
 top and sides of the aircraft and 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:28.020
 twenty millimeter cannon type 99 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.300
 much more powerful and accurate than 20 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.530
 mm gun type 97 which 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.690
 occurs on earlier 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.270
 bombers as a result 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.460
 enemy fighters on 6 and on top of this 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.230
 the plane is dropping fast enough 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.310
 and here with the rest of the defensive 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.920
 weapon trouble 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.970
 first on the plane as much as eight 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.890
 side shooters 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.510
 such a large number of airborne 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.450
 shooters is a headache when 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.980
 pumping the plane a little pump only 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.530
 accuracy and accuracy 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.590
 you need to pump in as many as eight shooters and 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.670
 most of these shooters 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.740
 Armed unfortunately only 7 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.050
 millimeter machine guns for so 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.420
 high level of this aircraft this 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.490
 clearly not high enough 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.960
 This aircraft provides not very 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.930
 comfortable level of battles 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.010
 in all fights you will meet 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.840
 opponents who are capable of you 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.460
 destroy with one or two visits a 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.860
 lack of powerful defensive 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:22.080
 weapons in front of the aircraft in 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.360
 the bottom of the aircraft and in the side portions 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.280
 airplanes will make you comparative 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.710
 easy and big targets for these 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.450
 opponents from here and the tactics of the game 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:34.140
 the plane is high altitude 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:36.450
 bomber loves heights from 7000 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.220
 meters at similar heights as a rule 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.320
 in the middle of the battle no one flies 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.180
 the whole fight usually goes down to the ground 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.430
 and your powerful bomb load 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.790
 allows you to successfully bomb out of such 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.770
 high altitude according tactics 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.450
 climb higher and circle as much as possible 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.340
 longer when the time comes 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.650
 recharge if you play not 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.180
 Arcadia and in historical battles successfully 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.280
 take a rather short light 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.730
 landing field will help you front 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.680
 chassis 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.750
 thanks to him, your stopping distance will be 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.970
 Significantly shorter than previous 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.790
 bomber models ska pose 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.740
 from the front highway can not be if with tactics 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.410
 games for this bomber basically 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:15.959
 everything is clear then the tactics of the game against him 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.580
 need to disassemble separately as the level 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:19.919
 this bomber has enough 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:22.470
 high then most likely you will have 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:24.340
 Enough powerful fighter before 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.500
 how to attack a bomber need to 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.139
 remember where he is among the main 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.540
 defensive armament is top and 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:34.449
 the back of the plane in the most perfect 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:37.240
 option first set you need to do either 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:39.310
 strictly forehead or at an angle to the side 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.949
 part of the aircraft in the video reviewed 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:44.650
 the most frequent first attack is an attack 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:47.139
 almost in the forehead and a little bit at an angle 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:50.380
 your main task with such an attack 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:52.900
 knock out the engine or pilot of an airplane 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.340
 approach speed is very high and you have 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.060
 there won't be much time to 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.919
 take aim 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.080
 but any hits in the front 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:01.660
 the aircraft is strong enough it 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:04.389
 damage upon completion of the attack to fly 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.220
 need under the plane there is no gun 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:07.690
 weapons as well as the speed you have 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.090
 will be very high you most likely 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.600
 don't even hurt and if they hurt not 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.760
 strong 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.650
 and let but how did you fly attacked 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.810
 bomber take your time 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:20.289
 turn around make sure that the distance 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:22.660
 between you already more than 800 meters on such 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:24.010
 distance side arrows already rather 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:26.380
 just you will not get 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:28.780
 if at all will shoot if you 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.850
 start the turnaround earlier you substitute 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.900
 the whole plane of your plane is 20 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:35.020
 millimeter cannon 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.910
 and there is no need to make such a gift to the enemy when 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:39.280
 turn it is advisable to perform combat 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:40.450
 turn saved energy will need 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.380
 you when you catch up 

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:43.450
 bombers 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.550
 after which the attack goes into the second 

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:47.979
 phase now you have to attack 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:50.229
 rear bombers in general ideally 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:52.330
 if there is a better opportunity to attack 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:54.610
 night bomber from the side they are clean 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.020
 from the back as soon as you saw the plane 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.770
 the enemy has received critical 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.960
 damage 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.460
 leave him fall alone not 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.169
 be sure to 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.860
 Dyson's enemy plane exploded in 

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:04.960
 the air 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.360
 sometimes it's enough just to get him out 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.580
 building and making sure that he will fall to the ground 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.860
 this is especially true in historical 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.210
 battles although frag it is and additionally 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:16.180
 cash reward 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:19.630
 but for victory the frags are not important themselves 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:21.310
 victory generally attack g5 n if you 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:23.470
 attacking in and behind as possible 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:26.200
 a little bit below the bottom turret is armed 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:28.150
 only 7 mm machine guns and hardly 

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:30.760
 will cause you too much damage 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:33.610
 summing up I want to say the following 

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:36.280
 g5 n settling at the same level as 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:37.620
 American b-17 is quite good 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:40.020
 alternative is you 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:42.690
 Japanese currency carries a lot 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:45.600
 bombs maybe altogether a little less successful 

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:48.150
 than American b-17 but still is 

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:50.610
 good bomber playing for this 

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:52.889
 plane climb higher beware 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:54.870
 enemy frontal attacks and help 

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:57.210
 team win if suddenly you see 

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:59.340
 what the enemy fighter is trying 

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:01.590
 you can crawl to the bottom of the game 

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:03.810
 use the following tactic just 

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:06.030
 turn the plane up the highway 

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:08.729
 this way the top side gunner 

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:10.979
 be at the bottom and 20 millimeter 

00:07:08.729 --> 00:07:13.289
 gun pusik upside down pussy less 

00:07:10.979 --> 00:07:15.690
 will definitely be able to protect more effectively 

00:07:13.289 --> 00:07:17.880
 your plane really made such 

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:19.169
 coup need to keep the plane in 

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:22.139
 horizontal position using 

00:07:19.169 --> 00:07:24.990
 w keys as much as possible rejecting the steering wheels 

00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:27.110
 heights from yourself if you play in a link 

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:29.400
 then ask a friend to cover you 

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:31.830
 possessing a fighter cover though 

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:34.080
 would be in one plane like a link of two 

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:36.630
 man able to pull the fight out 

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:39.090
 The main thing is to fly higher, but on this one 

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:42.080
 thank you all for all the attention 

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:42.080
 until
