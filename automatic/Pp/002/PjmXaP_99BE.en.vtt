 for the time being 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.190
 dad and mom 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.990
 in addition, the study 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.620
 we could believe it 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.620
 the chief of the army 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.680
 in addition to the fff 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.680
 Kuwait 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.060
 Four years ago 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.060
 business to follow 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:52.170
 our sport 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.980
 Yes 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.980
 in fact 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.530
 the perverse effect 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.140
 excellent late match 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:28.809
 the normands 

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:31.569
 for example 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.569
 wages advance their pawns 

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:39.769
 a rather surprising fact 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:42.769
 little by little 10 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:03.769
 there is one there was then 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:13.189
 m basic how to understand is how we are not in the program itself 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:16.319
 have the courage to write this problem 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:28.000
 no then place 6 5 it's too easy 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:31.030
 it 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.979
 that's why it's not 

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:36.189
 the simple principle 

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:38.519
 13 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.519

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:43.699
 the couple 

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:45.719
 to make 5 

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:50.420
 this night jerome room 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.420
