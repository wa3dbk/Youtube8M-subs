double-check I have went over this

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.789 
double-check I have went over this
machine<00:01:33.180> entirely<00:01:33.750> there<00:01:34.200> is<00:01:34.320> no<00:01:34.530> oil

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
reservoir which normally if there is an

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
the the oil reservoir I'm gonna flip

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.420 
the the oil reservoir I'm gonna flip
around<00:01:55.170> here<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.740> show<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.009> where<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.219> drain

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
around here and show you where the drain

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:03.139 
around here and show you where the drain
plug<00:01:56.610> is<00:01:59.600> here's<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.810> drain<00:02:01.079> plug<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:02.149> it

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
plug is here's the drain plug and it

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.319 
plug is here's the drain plug and it
comes<00:02:03.390> out<00:02:03.570> of<00:02:03.780> this<00:02:04.740> right<00:02:05.070> here<00:02:05.100> this<00:02:06.060> hole

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
comes out of this right here this hole

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:06.920 
comes out of this right here this hole
right<00:02:06.360> there

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
right there

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
right there
takes<00:02:07.170> an<00:02:07.320> Allen<00:02:07.590> wrench<00:02:08.450> it's<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.569> metric<00:02:09.950> as

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
takes an Allen wrench it's a metric as

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.220 
takes an Allen wrench it's a metric as
you<00:02:11.190> can<00:02:11.310> see<00:02:11.580> it<00:02:11.910> is

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
you can see it is

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.680 
you can see it is
six<00:02:14.230> six<00:02:15.129> millimeter<00:02:15.550> and<00:02:16.180> I<00:02:16.269> just<00:02:16.480> take<00:02:16.659> a

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
six six millimeter and I just take a

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.839 
six six millimeter and I just take a
pair<00:02:17.680> of<00:02:17.709> channellocks<00:02:18.190> on<00:02:18.370> the<00:02:18.459> short<00:02:18.730> end

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
pair of channellocks on the short end

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.059 
pair of channellocks on the short end
because<00:02:19.150> it's<00:02:19.299> it's<00:02:20.140> too<00:02:20.349> short<00:02:20.650> to<00:02:20.769> go<00:02:20.860> this

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
because it's it's too short to go this

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:22.979 
because it's it's too short to go this
way<00:02:21.280> so<00:02:21.640> I<00:02:21.670> put<00:02:21.909> it<00:02:21.970> in<00:02:22.030> this<00:02:22.209> way<00:02:22.360> with<00:02:22.900> the

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
way so I put it in this way with the

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:24.210 
way so I put it in this way with the
channel<00:02:23.290> locks<00:02:23.500> where<00:02:23.680> my<00:02:23.830> thumb<00:02:24.040> would<00:02:24.159> be

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
channel locks where my thumb would be

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.920 
channel locks where my thumb would be
and<00:02:24.580> twist<00:02:24.819> it<00:02:24.940> off<00:02:25.090> no<00:02:25.720> problem<00:02:26.220> all<00:02:27.220> right<00:02:27.930> so

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
and twist it off no problem all right so

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.229 
and twist it off no problem all right so
I'm<00:02:29.290> going<00:02:29.470> to<00:02:29.739> I've<00:02:30.700> already<00:02:30.940> changed<00:02:31.060> the

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
I'm going to I've already changed the

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:34.020 
I'm going to I've already changed the
filter<00:02:31.739> and<00:02:32.739> there's<00:02:32.980> a<00:02:33.040> different<00:02:33.670> vary<00:02:33.879> on

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
filter and there's a different vary on

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.949 
filter and there's a different vary on
the<00:02:34.060> service<00:02:34.599> some<00:02:35.379> are<00:02:35.500> calling<00:02:35.739> for<00:02:36.959> the

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
the service some are calling for the

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.640 
the service some are calling for the
seven<00:02:38.950> two<00:02:39.459> five<00:02:39.670> two<00:02:40.000> zero<00:02:40.440> seven<00:02:41.440> nine<00:02:41.470> nine

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
seven two five two zero seven nine nine

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.979 
seven two five two zero seven nine nine
what<00:02:42.549> was<00:02:42.700> initially<00:02:43.180> on<00:02:43.209> here<00:02:43.569> is<00:02:43.659> this<00:02:43.780> -

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
what was initially on here is this -

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.350 
what was initially on here is this -
five<00:02:44.230> four<00:02:44.500> zero<00:02:44.530> zero<00:02:44.950> 86<00:02:45.459> but<00:02:45.940> I<00:02:46.000> found<00:02:46.180> the

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
five four zero zero 86 but I found the

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.660 
five four zero zero 86 but I found the
threads<00:02:46.720> and<00:02:46.930> the<00:02:47.200> o-ring<00:02:47.560> are<00:02:47.739> the<00:02:47.860> same<00:02:48.129> the

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
threads and the o-ring are the same the

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.940 
threads and the o-ring are the same the
only<00:02:48.700> difference<00:02:48.819> is<00:02:49.299> is<00:02:49.480> about<00:02:49.780> this<00:02:50.680> much

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
only difference is is about this much

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.809 
only difference is is about this much
longer<00:02:51.160> right<00:02:51.549> here<00:02:52.530> so<00:02:53.530> which<00:02:54.250> would<00:02:54.459> be<00:02:54.579> good

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 
longer right here so which would be good

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.599 
longer right here so which would be good
but<00:02:55.569> what<00:02:56.290> I<00:02:56.319> ordered<00:02:56.799> was<00:02:57.069> what<00:02:57.459> was

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:57.609 
but what I ordered was what was

00:02:57.609 --> 00:02:59.190 
but what I ordered was what was
recommended<00:02:57.819> and<00:02:58.299> it<00:02:58.359> was<00:02:58.450> a<00:02:58.540> two<00:02:58.690> five<00:02:58.870> two

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
recommended and it was a two five two

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.309 
recommended and it was a two five two
zero<00:02:59.440> seven<00:03:00.069> nine<00:03:00.250> nine<00:03:00.400> so<00:03:00.879> I<00:03:01.120> found<00:03:02.109> either

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 
zero seven nine nine so I found either

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.300 
zero seven nine nine so I found either
or<00:03:02.560> works<00:03:03.660> okay<00:03:04.660> so<00:03:04.870> I've<00:03:05.739> got<00:03:05.799> it<00:03:05.950> drained

put the drain plug back in and refill it

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.730 
put the drain plug back in and refill it
with<00:03:11.349> oil<00:03:11.379> alright<00:03:12.129> thanks<00:03:12.310> for<00:03:12.340> watching
