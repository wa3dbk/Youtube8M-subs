but<00:00:44.879> then<00:00:45.090> I<00:00:45.239> started<00:00:45.690> studying<00:00:45.989> textual

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410

but then I started studying textual
criticism<00:00:47.070> as<00:00:47.219> it's<00:00:48.149> called

criticism as it's called

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.920 
criticism as it's called
and<00:00:48.690> came<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.140> conclusion<00:00:49.289> that<00:00:50.449> the<00:00:51.449> majority

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
and came to conclusion that the majority

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.080

text<00:00:52.170> not<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.829> TR<00:00:53.190> as<00:00:53.370> such<00:00:53.610> but<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:53.969> is

text not the TR as such but it is
similar<00:00:54.329> was<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.230> better<00:00:55.469> text<00:00:55.920> we<00:00:56.070> actually

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
similar was a better text we actually

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.830 
similar was a better text we actually
went<00:00:56.520> back<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.910> King<00:00:57.090> James<00:00:57.329> even<00:00:57.660> tho

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
went back to the King James even tho

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.279 
went back to the King James even tho
it's<00:00:57.989> ms<00:00:58.050> archaic<00:00:59.300> we<00:01:00.300> felt<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.930> text

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
it's ms archaic we felt that the text

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.670 
it's ms archaic we felt that the text
was<00:01:02.250> more<00:01:02.489> important<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.120> then<00:01:04.049> when<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.320> New

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
was more important and then when the New

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.800 
was more important and then when the New
King<00:01:04.920> James<00:01:04.949> came<00:01:05.489> out<00:01:05.700> we've<00:01:06.420> been<00:01:06.600> using

it's a very good view about the unity if
you<00:01:30.119> need<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.509> use<00:01:30.689> one<00:01:31.140> text<00:01:31.740> for<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:31.979> memory

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
with that why is it Don that most of the

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.219 
with that why is it Don that most of the
seminaries<00:01:45.060> have<00:01:45.299> chosen<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.810> use<00:01:45.840> new

American<00:01:46.649> Standard<00:01:47.420> well<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:48.780> think<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.439> new

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
American Standard well I think the new

a<00:01:53.579> literal<00:01:54.030> translation<00:01:54.590> very<00:01:55.590> word-for-word

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
a literal translation very word-for-word

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.590 
a literal translation very word-for-word
and<00:01:57.560> I<00:01:58.560> think<00:01:59.280> now<00:01:59.610> what<00:01:59.909> we<00:02:00.030> have<00:02:00.299> with<00:02:00.509> the

got an update on it already so we're

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.520 
got an update on it already so we're
we've<00:02:06.060> eliminated<00:02:06.329> a<00:02:06.659> lot<00:02:06.689> of<00:02:06.810> archaic<00:02:07.320> words

that probably didn't need to be there
and

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.410 
subscribe to marking priority the theory
that<00:02:36.829> mark<00:02:37.040> was<00:02:37.219> written<00:02:37.519> first<00:02:37.730> in<00:02:38.000> Matthew

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
that mark was written first in Matthew

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.319 
that mark was written first in Matthew
and<00:02:38.450> Luke<00:02:39.400> borrowed<00:02:40.400> marker<00:02:40.819> took<00:02:41.030> it<00:02:41.180> and

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:41.329 
and Luke borrowed marker took it and

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:42.670 
and Luke borrowed marker took it and
corrected<00:02:41.689> it<00:02:41.780> and<00:02:41.810> so<00:02:42.049> forth<00:02:42.349> and<00:02:42.560> that's

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
corrected it and so forth and that's

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.009 
corrected it and so forth and that's
become<00:02:43.010> a<00:02:43.040> very<00:02:43.280> popular<00:02:43.569> doctrine<00:02:44.569> even<00:02:44.689> in<00:02:44.959> a

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
lot of conservative seminaries and so

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.780 
lot of conservative seminaries and so
forth<00:02:47.329> we<00:02:47.540> we<00:02:48.260> reject<00:02:48.650> that<00:02:48.859> we<00:02:49.340> hold<00:02:49.579> to<00:02:49.730> an

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
forth we we reject that we hold to an

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.990 
forth we we reject that we hold to an
independent<00:02:50.030> view<00:02:50.840> of<00:02:50.959> the<00:02:51.049> Gospels<00:02:51.560> and<00:02:52.000> I

independent view of the Gospels and I

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.089 
independent view of the Gospels and I
think<00:02:53.659> things<00:02:54.109> like<00:02:54.290> that<00:02:54.349> are<00:02:54.560> the<00:02:54.709> reasons

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:55.099 
think things like that are the reasons

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:57.699 
think things like that are the reasons
that<00:02:55.189> it's<00:02:55.819> only<00:02:56.000> used<00:02:56.239> in<00:02:56.299> seminaries<00:02:56.900> but<00:02:57.139> in

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
that it's only used in seminaries but in

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:58.959 
that it's only used in seminaries but in
churches<00:02:58.219> where<00:02:58.370> there's<00:02:58.549> a<00:02:58.579> lot<00:02:58.700> of<00:02:58.819> emphasis

00:02:58.959 --> 00:02:58.969 
churches where there's a lot of emphasis

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:01.780 
churches where there's a lot of emphasis
on<00:02:59.450> the<00:03:00.109> original<00:03:00.500> languages<00:03:00.950> not<00:03:01.189> a<00:03:01.250> proper

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
on the original languages not a proper

on the original languages not a proper
reading<00:03:01.939> of<00:03:02.239> it<00:03:02.389> and<00:03:02.900> hopefully<00:03:03.290> with<00:03:03.620> the

reading of it and hopefully with the

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
update we're going to we've got

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.919 
update we're going to we've got
something<00:03:06.139> more<00:03:06.379> readable<00:03:06.709> to
