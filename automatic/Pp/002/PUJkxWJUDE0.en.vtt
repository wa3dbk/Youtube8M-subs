00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.030

to<00:00:39.300> another<00:00:39.510> target<00:00:39.900> and<00:00:40.260> they<00:00:40.440> were<00:00:40.500> all<00:00:40.829> on

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
to another target and they were all on

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.340 
to another target and they were all on
clearance<00:00:41.250> so<00:00:42.210> we<00:00:42.360> bought<00:00:42.570> them<00:00:42.750> again<00:00:43.080> and

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
clearance so we bought them again and

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.600 
clearance so we bought them again and
then<00:00:43.470> just<00:00:43.650> took<00:00:43.830> back<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.220> ones<00:00:44.400> that

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
then just took back the ones that

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:45.799 
then just took back the ones that
weren't<00:00:44.760> on<00:00:44.879> clearance<00:00:45.269> to<00:00:45.420> get<00:00:45.510> our<00:00:45.629> money

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
weren't on clearance to get our money

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.329 
weren't on clearance to get our money
back<00:00:45.900> since<00:00:46.350> we<00:00:46.409> were<00:00:46.589> gonna<00:00:46.710> save<00:00:46.979> some<00:00:47.220> money

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:47.339 
back since we were gonna save some money

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:50.560 
back since we were gonna save some money
so<00:00:48.059> these<00:00:48.629> are<00:00:48.869> regularly<00:00:49.320> at<00:00:49.680> my<00:00:49.949> target

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
so these are regularly at my target

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.219 
so these are regularly at my target
$6.99<00:00:51.570> but<00:00:51.809> we<00:00:51.930> got<00:00:52.080> them<00:00:52.199> for<00:00:52.610> 488<00:00:53.839> so<00:00:54.839> I<00:00:54.869> think

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:55.229 
$6.99 but we got them for 488 so I think

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:56.660 
$6.99 but we got them for 488 so I think
that's<00:00:55.379> actually<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.769> pretty<00:00:55.949> good<00:00:56.189> deal<00:00:56.250> for

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
that's actually a pretty good deal for

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.700 
that's actually a pretty good deal for
these<00:00:56.850> um<00:00:57.119> even<00:00:57.780> though<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.110> original<00:00:58.290> price

these um even though the original price

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.710 
these um even though the original price
is<00:00:58.920> super<00:00:59.400> cheap<00:00:59.699> compared<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.299> a<00:01:00.390> lot<00:01:00.600> of
