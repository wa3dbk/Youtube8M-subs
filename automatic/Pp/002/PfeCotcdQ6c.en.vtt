00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.330
 that much of the mid-range and budget 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.760
 samsung devices are described 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.320
 like an original unit sausage 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.000
 then samsung seems a bit lacquer 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.430
 and it seems the electronics giant 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.750
 prefer an updated version or follow up 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.580
 from a device that has already appeared 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.170
 then bring it back to the 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.109
 drawing board for a completely new one 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.820
 concept you within the lower price range 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.340
 this does not always have to look bad 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.109
 suits and this samsung galaxy s2 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.940
 proves that it goes in both devices 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.830
 also not necessarily how it looks 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.600
 type of Samsung appearance much plastic in 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.729
 in design and ridges on the back 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.710
 but more to the performance it 

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:42.330
 supplies many manufacturers and choose 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.070
 namely for devices in this 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.470
 price category with the one 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.449
 guide single-core processor while that 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.640
 in practice, still for the necessary 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:52.769
 faltering devices and on one 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.870
 faltering have this age2 just right 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:57.239
 rarely caught and that means 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.610
 that's the choice for an 890 core processor 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.290
 so the good wash is unfortunate that this one 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.420
 you two still agree with it anyway 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.650
 considerably outdated android two three point 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.350
 6 is equipped 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.930
 however from March or actually April 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.490
 This year will be an update to Android 4 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.619
 point a jellybean become available and 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.600
 thus it beats and by type 0 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.009
 just about it is a shame 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.320
 the situation cannot yet take action 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.789
 see with that operating system because that 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.009
 android gingerbread 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:24.600
 we now know the skin 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.460
 from samsung is equipped with a number 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.619
 pre-installed applications 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.600
 not very much special though 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.670
 mini diary and the photo editor quite a bit 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.329
 nice additions you also have access 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.829
 until 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.170
 have social and all you come into it 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.399
 social fellow and you together now 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.409
 if you find it handy 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.359
 all return to one central location 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.700
 then it can be handy but i like it 

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:47.009
 personally a bit messy and too 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.229
 an unclear eyes so I use 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.329
 prefer the official apps facebook and 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.679
 twitter that just run nicely 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.200
 focus on whatsapp too 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:57.390
 is going to be a train internet page 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.069
 on this 3.8 inch touch screen good 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.679
 readable that is thanks to the resolution of 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:04.409
 the screen that amounts to 480 by 800 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:06.600
 pixels can load a page 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.670
 sometimes slow is striking 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.770
 incidentally that the 5 megapixel camera on 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.660
 the back makes pretty nice pictures 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.360
 certainly good lighting conditions 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.020
 she sharp and the led on the back 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.060
 ensures that you are also in the dark 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.410
 ezinge can do quite a kick 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.880
 you like that of moving people yes then 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.560
 the photos may be a little blurry 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.150
 but when everyone is silent for a moment 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.840
 then it is actually pretty good too 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.180
 to do 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.100
 video you record in 720p and it 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.260
 camera at the front 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.390
 captures handy in VGA quality 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.370
 Skype and video calling 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.080
 in the first instance the galaxy s2 can reach 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.460
 me out on 3 stars but I thought so 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.270
 actually a bit on the low side 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.680
 for this device 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.810
 for example, I compare it with the 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.490
 galaxies plus and so free 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.470
 recently review the and that only two 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.240
 tens of cheaper than this first 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.340
 two yes then this device still performs 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.200
 considerably better it is faster 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.150
 a higher screen resolution a better one 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.490
 camera and moreover the battery runtime 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.350
 excellent easily lasts two days 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.000
 and whoever and saintly does reddit 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.710
 even a third day 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.420
 however, it was the old version of 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.160
 Android to score significantly down 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.910
 just pulled because of an update to jelly 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.020
 bean 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.940
 probably this month 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.740
 is available for these two were 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.780
 added a half star and ended 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.020
 device with a earned three and half 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.020
 star
