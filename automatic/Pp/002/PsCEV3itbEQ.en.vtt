appreciate<00:00:31.500> I<00:00:31.710> think<00:00:32.160> they<00:00:32.250> can<00:00:32.399> use<00:00:32.550> that<00:00:32.669> but

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.700 
appreciate I think they can use that but
i<00:00:32.850> think<00:00:33.030> it<00:00:33.120> just<00:00:33.149> causes<00:00:33.390> more<00:00:33.540> errors<00:00:34.530> for

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710
