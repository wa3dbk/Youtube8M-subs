00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.339
 jaimes 

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:24.650
 hello friends today martín lutero 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.620
 After making my first presentation video and uploading it, I dedicated myself to 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.470
 think and think to see what topics I would do with it and I tell it and so I followed 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.360
 thinking when he was sleeping xd 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.030
 when I ate xd when I bathed xd until I had the idea to do this 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.740
 analysis about unanimously loved and that moved many with their goal and their 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.860
 romanticism including me 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.910
 and that is one of my favorite animes 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.390
 that's how I mean they understood so let's start 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.270
 good everything starts with the graduates a species that is similar to the 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.920
 humans except that diplomats differ by a few horns in the 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.140
 head similar to cat ears also by some vectors that are like 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.640
 invisible arms several meters in range and that can destroy and 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.480
 tear up almost anything 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.440
 he is also characterized by his killer instinct 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.610
 well the story focuses on an article of mine is called rossi that 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.610
 is in a research center to do tests everything starts 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.320
 when I escaped leaving a bunch of mutilated dead 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.760
 dismembered decapitated dismembered and others 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.800
 after he has almost managed to escape a sniper reaches him to shoot 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.600
 in the head it has been if it falls into the faint sea 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.740
 after this we know other characters that are short and cassava 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.380
 while they are on the beach they find light and but now lusilla 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.409
 she was not a ruthless murderer but after receiving the bullet in the 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.080
 head by the sniper had created a double personality of 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.930
 murder a sweet and sweet silly girl who did not say more kenyu to a pub 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.039
 and as they just said 'you put the name on' you good here stopped you but 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:56.680
 it ruins them in history 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.420
 so I'll talk about the characters 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.420
 good among the main characters are 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.840
 one of aggressively ruthless aggressive clones since at nine 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.560
 awakens his violent instinct I do not tell them because if I'm not going to spur them 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.739
 then we have his double personality miku that is the opposite of us and bone 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.959
 is sweet 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:19.549
 and innocent and not ávila 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:21.609
 well then we have 

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:22.829
 a stupid boy 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:24.180
 he had a dark past 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.489
 and it's very nice since any homeless girl is given a home I do not know why 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:32.269
 but to the majority of the fans of the anime this asshole of dimension to the majority 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:35.659
 it falls like a kick in the eggs I think including myself 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:38.959
 Yucca is the premium of Cota 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.519
 she is in love with cota since she was a girl 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:45.029
 he never enrolled in the same university as he does to be with him 

00:02:45.029 --> 00:02:49.120
 just like this girl is just as hated by anime fans because 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.969
 she is always very jealous for miku 

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:53.969
 Well, I do not care, this yucca pendeja 

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:59.319
 this girl named nanao known as number seven is a diploma us she 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:03.129
 since he was born he is in the laboratory where the us inc was since they use it 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:07.269
 for experiments of physical endurance and strength but she does not mind being 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.220
 a test subject since he does it for the love of his father the director kurama 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.210
 although nana is an article nius she does not have the characteristics of a diploma 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.939
 and the normal 

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:19.019
 since she is quiet peaceful and very sweet 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:20.260
 and it does not kill anyone 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.160
 this nana girl is in the majority one of the favorite characters of the anime 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:25.329
 thanks to the fans 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:28.329
 he is also one of my favorite characters 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:32.999
 This girl named May is a 12 year old girl who lives on the street with her 

00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:35.540
 puppy dog ​​who considers his best friend 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.340
 she escaped from her house since her stepfather the very hothead raped her and her 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.429
 mom did not believe her and that's why she escaped she stays to live with short 

00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:46.629
 uu I fell nana after they are going to return an umbrella 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:49.579
 for me the story of May is one of the saddest 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:53.379
 and well I think these are the most important characters of the anime there 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:56.620
 other characters but yes I tell them they would be exported 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.139
 since it has a lot of importance in the story and in the end 

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:02.819
 Well now I will give you my personal opinion 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:06.629
 in my opinion the phenyl and this is one of the best series I've seen since 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:10.279
 They combine gore with the romantic and has a very beautiful openning and has 

00:04:10.279 --> 00:04:14.379
 images that are based on real paintings and the environment is wrong is a 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:15.509
 pop song 

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:18.639
 the anime only consists of 13 episodes plus a play 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:21.379
 so if you have not seen it I recommend it 

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:25.229
 well this is the end of the video since you know accepted their criticisms and 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:29.150
 recommendations to analyze and criticize unanimously accepted invitations 

00:04:29.149 --> 00:04:31.710
 of friend and personal messages 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.220
 and sent greetings to my friends and those who watched this video 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.050
 now yes goodbye and be careful
