my camera bag or the pocket on my jacket
and<00:02:12.580> just<00:02:12.910> charge<00:02:13.270> it<00:02:13.480> as<00:02:13.630> I<00:02:13.900> go<00:02:13.930> and<00:02:14.560> I<00:02:14.680> can

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
and just charge it as I go and I can

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.000 
and just charge it as I go and I can
quickly<00:02:15.130> unplug<00:02:15.970> it<00:02:16.150> if<00:02:16.360> I<00:02:16.600> need<00:02:16.810> to<00:02:16.990> on<00:02:17.770> the

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
quickly unplug it if I need to on the

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.250 
quickly unplug it if I need to on the
bigger<00:02:18.190> camera<00:02:18.670> I<00:02:18.820> can<00:02:19.030> of<00:02:19.150> course<00:02:19.180> do<00:02:19.630> exactly

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
bigger camera I can of course do exactly

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.920 
bigger camera I can of course do exactly
the<00:02:20.530> same<00:02:20.560> thing<00:02:21.400> but<00:02:21.790> since<00:02:22.090> they<00:02:22.300> are<00:02:22.510> bigger

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
the same thing but since they are bigger

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.440 
the same thing but since they are bigger
and<00:02:23.050> more<00:02:23.470> rigid<00:02:23.740> with<00:02:24.250> more<00:02:24.490> mounting<00:02:25.060> points

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
and more rigid with more mounting points

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:42.500 
and more rigid with more mounting points
you<00:02:25.570> can<00:02:25.720> get<00:02:25.930> a<00:02:26.080> bit<00:02:26.320> more<00:02:26.560> creative

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.509 

okay<00:02:43.510> so<00:02:43.569> how<00:02:43.989> long<00:02:44.319> does<00:02:44.560> it<00:02:44.620> last<00:02:44.769> in<00:02:45.190> my

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
okay so how long does it last in my

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.490 
okay so how long does it last in my
review<00:02:45.940> of<00:02:45.970> the<00:02:46.239> pocket<00:02:46.660> camera<00:02:47.019> I<00:02:47.170> did<00:02:47.379> a

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
review of the pocket camera I did a

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.830 
review of the pocket camera I did a
time-lapse<00:02:48.129> with<00:02:48.519> just<00:02:48.790> included<00:02:49.420> battery

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
time-lapse with just included battery

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.229 
time-lapse with just included battery
which<00:02:50.080> lasted<00:02:50.530> one<00:02:50.769> hour<00:02:50.800> after<00:02:51.250> that<00:02:51.910> I<00:02:51.940> used

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
which lasted one hour after that I used

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.600 
which lasted one hour after that I used
a<00:02:52.390> third<00:02:52.690> party<00:02:53.110> together<00:02:53.290> with<00:02:53.709> a<00:02:53.739> lipo<00:02:54.340> and<00:02:54.550> I

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
a third party together with a lipo and I

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.330 
a third party together with a lipo and I
was<00:02:54.790> able<00:02:54.910> to<00:02:55.060> go<00:02:55.269> for<00:02:55.569> five<00:02:55.750> hours<00:02:55.780> now<00:02:56.410> the<00:02:56.860> 4k

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
was able to go for five hours now the 4k

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.309 
was able to go for five hours now the 4k
production<00:02:57.819> camera<00:02:58.120> is<00:02:58.269> way<00:02:58.720> more<00:02:59.049> power

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
production camera is way more power

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:01.170 
production camera is way more power
hungry<00:02:59.680> so<00:03:00.190> that's<00:03:00.430> the<00:03:00.580> one<00:03:00.760> that<00:03:00.910> I'm<00:03:01.030> going

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
hungry so that's the one that I'm going

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.050 
hungry so that's the one that I'm going
to<00:03:01.209> use<00:03:01.269> this<00:03:01.810> time<00:03:02.190> same<00:03:03.190> settings<00:03:03.610> screen

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
to use this time same settings screen

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.690 
to use this time same settings screen
brightness<00:03:04.360> at<00:03:04.660> 100%<00:03:05.319> focus<00:03:05.980> peaking<00:03:06.160> is<00:03:06.459> on

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
brightness at 100% focus peaking is on

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.270 
brightness at 100% focus peaking is on
and<00:03:06.940> is<00:03:07.330> one<00:03:07.540> frame<00:03:07.810> every<00:03:08.200> 10<00:03:08.410> seconds<00:03:08.920> this

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
and is one frame every 10 seconds this

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.430 
and is one frame every 10 seconds this
time<00:03:09.519> I<00:03:09.670> also<00:03:09.879> have<00:03:10.239> audio<00:03:10.540> meters<00:03:11.080> and<00:03:11.319> a

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
time I also have audio meters and a

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.470 
time I also have audio meters and a
histogram<00:03:12.010> so<00:03:12.250> I<00:03:12.310> guess<00:03:12.549> they<00:03:12.790> need<00:03:12.970> a<00:03:13.150> tiny

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
histogram so I guess they need a tiny

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:39.839 
histogram so I guess they need a tiny
bit<00:03:13.690> more

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:39.849 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:43.420 

and<00:03:40.849> exactly<00:03:41.450> like<00:03:41.870> last<00:03:42.230> time<00:03:42.680> both<00:03:43.069> me<00:03:43.400> and

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
and exactly like last time both me and

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.820 
and exactly like last time both me and
the<00:03:43.700> dog<00:03:43.970> started<00:03:44.390> to<00:03:44.450> lose<00:03:44.840> our<00:03:45.080> will<00:03:45.410> to<00:03:45.620> live

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
the dog started to lose our will to live

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.339 
the dog started to lose our will to live
out<00:03:46.129> of<00:03:46.160> boredom<00:03:46.940> so<00:03:47.180> after<00:03:47.480> two<00:03:47.690> hours<00:03:47.900> we

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:48.349 
out of boredom so after two hours we

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:50.830 
out of boredom so after two hours we
aborted<00:03:48.920> and<00:03:49.069> decided<00:03:49.670> to<00:03:49.700> see<00:03:50.030> how<00:03:50.330> much<00:03:50.540> was

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
aborted and decided to see how much was

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.009 
aborted and decided to see how much was
left<00:03:51.050> the<00:03:51.800> camera<00:03:52.129> still<00:03:52.340> showed<00:03:52.780> 100%<00:03:53.780> and

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
left the camera still showed 100% and

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:58.360 
left the camera still showed 100% and
charger<00:03:54.530> claims<00:03:54.830> that<00:03:55.099> it's<00:03:55.280> 20%<00:03:55.849> left<00:03:57.190> so<00:03:58.190> if

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
charger claims that it's 20% left so if

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.640 
charger claims that it's 20% left so if
we<00:03:58.610> do<00:03:58.790> the<00:03:58.970> math<00:03:59.180> two<00:03:59.900> batteries<00:04:00.379> will<00:04:00.620> last

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
we do the math two batteries will last

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.250 
we do the math two batteries will last
for<00:04:01.040> five<00:04:01.430> or<00:04:01.670> six<00:04:01.970> hours<00:04:02.390> of<00:04:02.569> continuous

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
for five or six hours of continuous

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.350 
for five or six hours of continuous
recording<00:04:03.920> on<00:04:04.069> the<00:04:04.160> production<00:04:04.610> camera<00:04:04.970> and

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
recording on the production camera and

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.119 
recording on the production camera and
on<00:04:05.569> the<00:04:05.720> pocket<00:04:06.110> camera<00:04:06.470> I<00:04:06.590> guess<00:04:06.709> it<00:04:06.980> would

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:07.129 
on the pocket camera I guess it would

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:09.580 
on the pocket camera I guess it would
run<00:04:07.310> for<00:04:07.700> anything<00:04:08.120> from<00:04:08.540> six<00:04:08.930> hours<00:04:09.319> to<00:04:09.560> a

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
run for anything from six hours to a

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.309 
run for anything from six hours to a
week<00:04:10.160> or<00:04:10.430> something<00:04:10.720> links<00:04:11.720> to<00:04:11.840> the<00:04:11.959> stuff<00:04:12.140> is

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 
week or something links to the stuff is

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:14.080 
week or something links to the stuff is
in<00:04:12.470> the<00:04:12.590> description<00:04:13.220> until<00:04:13.760> next<00:04:13.849> time
