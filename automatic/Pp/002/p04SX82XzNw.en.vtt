00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.090
 Work then I came back here clothes 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.399
 because sometimes when I need to 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:22.109
 a little more formal I go light 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:22.109

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.939
 I get very little clothes 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.299

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:03.100
 low and okazaki while demanding only 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:05.500

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.990
 idea 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:09.759

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.980
 body that stayed so many people play 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:15.720
 printer that can be 18 ° and stays 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.720
