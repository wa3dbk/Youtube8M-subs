 today dream what you want without worrying 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:10.040
 for nothing he hears a woman who realizes 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:14.260
 of his soul 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:16.930
 today you are going to make the sun public 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:19.390
 so that I can hurt you everything is going 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:22.240
 very, very good morning and welcome to 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.220
 my house but just as I am in the 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.580
 your house you are also in 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:31.780
 my house is a pleasure to receive it all 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:35.170
 Friday and what beautiful clothes I have 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:40.000
 notice what is the changes to all 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:42.760
 sublimated of via margutta and is what it is 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.980
 here all the data have the phones 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:49.629
 talk to me with the girls, go and see 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:52.750
 the show room is crazy and now we're going 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:53.440
 to see him work the little sir if he is not 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.879
 a habit 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.290
 I'm going to confess that he's an addict 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:59.760
 to work 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.170
 I already believe that he will be born with a brush 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.050
 it will have been a little uncomfortable for you 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.850
 mother but he came out with a brush let's go 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.740
 to see Mr. photo of the real thinker of 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.740
 please see us working 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.050
 well my dear how are you doing good 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.930
 let's make some roses in the roses 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.910
 remember that we are using a 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.580
 complex volume what does a 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:35.070
 complex volume a complex volume is 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:38.100
 when we have a lot of 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.220
 petals but that each one responds to a 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.280
 overall volume is a gradient towards the 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:48.060
 look, I'm going to work with the 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.630
 the carm and nothing the red a small 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.330
 proportion of blue to neutralize 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:57.640
 minimum proportion of yellow 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:00.880
 remember that the bases 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.320
 they are the intermediate color between light and 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:08.399
 the shadow after I will go working 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:10.920
 with red yellow a little blue 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.950
 remember that when I'm working with 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.930
 red or in the theory of red I do not 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.349
 I put earth in shadow for shade 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.950
 I'm going to put red mixed with lacquer 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:25.260
 carmina da and a little blue 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.349
 remember that I am painting from nature 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.079
 I had to paint the entire background 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:34.340
 because when I paint the whole background 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:37.040
 then I do not have clean spaces 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:42.170
 Look how good I'll work the 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:44.650
 shadow with red and blue walked to 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.819
 goodison de grade towards the shadows 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:50.420
 I press more pressure I'm working 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:52.910
 with a plant number 4 the solids already 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.879
 They know what solids are insaurralde or 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:58.290
 otherwise this will not cover them and crazy 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:01.560
 Of course 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.750
 but good also good I want 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.450
 send you many greetings all the 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.219
 part the whole area of ​​my current is 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.130
 pure that I will be getting in 

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:12.920
 these days 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.570
 for the surubí national holiday we're going 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:18.040
 to see if we let him in to the uriburu 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:22.220
 because he does not have the passport a day but 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:24.320
 it's going to be an awesome party they 're going to 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.560
 see all the pictures I carry and 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:30.340
 I thank your fan of Santa Fe Atilra 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.340
 for having us 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:36.470
 to spend the day having a great time 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.180
 and all the people of Raphaëla right 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.230
 to the commodore rivadavia that 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:44.780
 followed up there 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:48.319
 So, look, I'm going to sketch 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:50.810
 minimally how will the petal go 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:55.819
 as we have worked with the theory of 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:04:00.069
 red is neutralized with blue and a 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:00.069
 little on the walk to 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:10.230
 I'm going to light it up with yellow red 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:12.420
 and still orange look at an orange 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.879
 I put a little bit of white remember 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:18.900
 that when I do not put blue 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:22.139
 because when I'm illuminating the blue and 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:25.620
 the red would soil the color then 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:28.020
 see how I'm giving 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:32.169
 a little lighting that I'm going to 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:35.650
 finish with the lighting after 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:38.569
 when you start working with a brush 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:41.409
 it's softer with this I'm 

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:46.330
 more or less possesses such 

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:49.630
 I'm going to mix the blue red again 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:53.260
 a little bit of yellow and there 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:55.660
 today in a degraded state towards the shadow 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.790
 the shadow I want to give my regards to 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.900

 a brush ready softer as to 

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:30.270
 make the lights more marked 

00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:34.520
 logically that this is going to end 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:39.100
 through the hard the hard candle 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:42.750
