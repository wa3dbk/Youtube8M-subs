00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
 Hi guys, how are you? I'm here for today. 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.220
 make my top 5 linx products only 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.040
 I'll show you the products I 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.889
 The more I like the brand, the more I have no order. 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.740
 preferably I'll talk random then 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.830
 I'll start by talking about the jumbo 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.680
 brand that make the game very successful is 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.500
 This pencil is more chubby and I have 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.109
 these two colors I have brown and 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.470
 White, I'll show you the white. 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.170
 because it's what makes the most success, it's a 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.600
 pencil that is very peppery du and when 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.649
 you pass on your eyelid it looks good 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.110
 white 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.710
 Then you can spread it with your finger. 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.530
 So it does not look so creamy to him. 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.829
 the best on the skin and it 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.680
 like shadow base people the white jumbo 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.899
 nike who calls a thousand who is the best 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.120
 base in my opinion because 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.570
 if you want to wear a makeup as well 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:04.439
 but its shade is not pepper 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.450
 so it does not take much color that 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.729
 product here is perfect because it leaves 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.920
 the shadow much more alive and make you 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.110
 Shadow fix more on your eyelid then 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.390
 It will last a lot longer. 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.060
 another product that is in my top 5 is the 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:22.409
 little eyebrow this kit calls 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:25.950
 to yoki power and it has several colors have 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:29.430
 for brunettes there are blondes behind and this one 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.950
 from here it's for redheads albarn head calls 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.110
 and I 'll leave the list with the name of 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.600
 all the products on the blog for you 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.670
 a blog post is linked here in the box 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.509

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.329
 down here 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:45.180
 and this product here I think it 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.790
 simply incredible because it comes 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.250
 two dollar shadows come one more tone 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.009
 dark and a lighter tone comes 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.689
 Miss you to sit eyebrow 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.180
 for her to stay in the place and know not to 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.130
 get that rebellious eyebrow that the 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.860
 counts everywhere 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:05.159
 so you pass would stay in place and 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.079
 come two neighboring brushes come scovino 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.750
 and for eyebrow brushes to 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:12.000
 straightening and bored ocean 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.740

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.080

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.220
 sunbathing here I think you or 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.950

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:30.360
