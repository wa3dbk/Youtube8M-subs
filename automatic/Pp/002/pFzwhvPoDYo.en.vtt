00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:08.610
 The monastery Pernegg is an inspiration 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.349
 for body mind and soul and offers 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.590
 with its different fast 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.950
 variations a holistic 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.460
 regeneration program 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.500
 we have different fasting 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:22.460
 possibilities here in the monastery 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:26.039
 Fasting is one of the most profound 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:29.820
 therapies in naturopathy the 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.890
 fast after dr otto buchinger is the 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.950
 conscious and voluntary waiver 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.590
 solid foods and stimulants such as 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:41.760
 alcohol nicotine for a limited 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:45.090
 period then there is the basenfasten 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:49.170
 That is a mild fasting form 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.899
 you can say a nosed chur without 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.680
 hunger the special with the basenfasten 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:59.930
 is that the body is very well deacidified 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:04.140
 and purify and eat tasty food 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:06.270
 still allowed we have that too 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.990
 be neither fasting in the offer 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:15.110
 targeted measures are taken 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:18.750
 through massage techniques and detoxification 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:21.920
 measures where the body then the 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:26.119
 accumulated metabolism end products 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:29.009
 and excrete toxin 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:32.520
 It is very cheap if you fast that 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.470
 Well prepared and I see that as 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.600
 Holistic fasting project so if 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.900
 we divide this into three phases 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.990
 Relief time the fast days and the 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.090
 Construction time is very important in advance 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.579
 our fast best ever 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.439
 information as they provide at home the 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.020
 Prepare fast well 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:55.850
 that means ideally one to three 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.590
 days before stop on coffee and 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.840
 to refrain from other means of consumption 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.140
 but what we do here if you are 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.580
 at home not so good to come here in 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.369
 costa there is a 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:11.760
 relief day as the name says 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.730
 simply relieve the strain on the body 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.880
 give the possibility to fast 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.190
 adjust 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.600
 the monastery pernegg is not only 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.490
 a fasting center 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.430
 It is above all a place for the 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.200
 Discover the silence of the monastic 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.750
 ambience with the beautiful 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.940
 Klostergarten invites you to reflect 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.400
 but also the untouched nature of the 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.740
 waldviertels helps the guests again 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.880
 inner voice to listen to yourself 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.190
 find yourself 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:42.960
 mostly it has to feel that way 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:44.580
 only caught somewhere it says tell us 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.850
 the human now let's make dust 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:51.120
 or worse, one and the other 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:53.330
 points out and says hey take a break 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.640
 we were last vacation 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:03:00.480
 or when do you even have time 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.100
 had for yourself that's it and 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.860
 then one comes for example on such 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.790
 places then somehow monastery again 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.130
 modern 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.560
 because it is not for nothing that in one 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.810
 common monastery so eg a monastery 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.050
 Operation like Geras that one there 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:19.830
 guest master has just a guest 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:22.470
 Master takes care of a guest and that 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.540
 should be intense so you sunbathe 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.720
 I feel I'm not there somehow 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:30.209
 alone but if I want I have 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.160
 even escort there the hectic 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:35.010
 renounce life for some time and 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.760
 consciously experienced and decelerated days 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.390
 enjoy 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:42.739
 for a healthy long life more 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.739
