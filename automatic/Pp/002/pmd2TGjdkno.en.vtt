00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.460
 Y 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.369
 before doing the slow fandango 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.610
 56 times 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:20.270
 I did not care about the web and what happens 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.740
 with the accents the second plus three not 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.600
 like the bulería that there are parts that go to 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:28.159
 two in this case we would go then 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:37.610
 the accents coincide in the first 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:40.539
 half in 12 3 and the second is the 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.539
 rhythm that we have here 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.869
 yes 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:14.030
 12 1 2 3 4 6 7 8 9 10 12 23 46 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:19.370
 23 46 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:42.890
 there is a silence in the first part without 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:42.890
 the 5th of the second on 11 25 69 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.790
 good and now let's see how it 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:04.980
 I would put everything in its place 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.379
 we will start with the rhythm covered the 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.000
 Clogged rhythm will enter the 12 wood 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:16.850
 sweet 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:19.900
 and the indexes do against you 1 and 2 and 3 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:23.100
 and 4 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:33.620
 on the 5th we will leave it in silence 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:33.620
 I repeat 12 and 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 5 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:49.380
 12 2 3 and 4 if we counted as the second 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:50.710
 half would be 6 7 8 9 10 same as the 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:04:00.190
 bulería 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:04:03.640
 12 1 2 3 4 6 7 8 9 and 10 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:07.590
 we will enter with him with the chord and see 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:10.750
 9 always counting that the nut 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:13.440
 it's not a flat 8 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:17.290
 but we will call him flat 9 equally 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:24.030
 then this is so that you will have 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:24.030
 more in the right hand 12 3 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:33.580
 69 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.580
 All this 

00:04:34.499 --> 00:04:37.499
 69 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.830
 the sequence of the Flemish cadence 

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:50.209
 what is four chords that are the least 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.599
 They are 7a 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.570
 funk 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.450
 we see 9 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.110
 and we will tell him and we will do it 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.980
 next form 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.980
 12 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.410
 2. 3 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:26.610
 each wood 12 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:34.729
 69 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.590
 69 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:57.470
 3. 4 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.490
 i 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.030
 after doing this what 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:05.590
 we will do is the basis of fandango in the 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:07.840
 basis of fandango yes we tell it to 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:08.979
 12 times we have the following 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:17.340
 shape 

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:17.340
 12 36 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:23.570
 yes 89 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:37.280
 12 23 56 79 

00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:43.089
 12 

00:06:45.219 --> 00:06:49.380
 6 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:51.710
 Y 

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:51.710
 to the sun 

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.620
 following
