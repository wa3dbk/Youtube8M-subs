because<00:01:41.700> of<00:01:41.939> course<00:01:42.229> there<00:01:43.229> were<00:01:43.350> rumors<00:01:43.829> of

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
because of course there were rumors of

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.469 
because of course there were rumors of
the<00:01:44.130> CEO<00:01:44.600> wanted<00:01:45.600> by<00:01:45.950> Barcelona<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.280> today<00:01:47.640> he

the CEO wanted by Barcelona and today he

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.359 
the CEO wanted by Barcelona and today he
played<00:01:48.840> quite<00:01:49.170> decent<00:01:49.770> in<00:01:49.890> my<00:01:50.009> opinion

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
played quite decent in my opinion

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.090

nothing<00:01:51.299> more<00:01:51.509> nothing<00:01:51.570> less<00:01:51.990> but<00:01:52.829> who<00:01:53.009> I

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
nothing more nothing less but who I

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.569 
nothing more nothing less but who I
really<00:01:53.460> enjoyed<00:01:54.000> on<00:01:54.680> in<00:01:55.680> terms<00:01:55.950> of<00:01:56.070> fullbacks

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
really enjoyed on in terms of fullbacks

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.780 
really enjoyed on in terms of fullbacks
was<00:01:56.820> antonioli<00:01:57.509> because<00:01:58.020> Anthony<00:01:58.560> Lee<00:01:58.829> is

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
was antonioli because Anthony Lee is

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.389 
was antonioli because Anthony Lee is
probably<00:02:00.360> one<00:02:00.719> of<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:01.020> only<00:02:01.049> full<00:02:01.950> backs<00:02:02.159> that

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
probably one of the only full backs that

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.819 
probably one of the only full backs that
we<00:02:02.549> have<00:02:02.700> that<00:02:03.030> actually<00:02:03.659> pushes<00:02:04.229> up<00:02:04.350> front

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
we have that actually pushes up front

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.520 
we have that actually pushes up front
and<00:02:05.070> gets<00:02:05.850> into<00:02:06.090> attacking<00:02:06.600> positioning<00:02:07.439> and

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
and gets into attacking positioning and

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.740 
and gets into attacking positioning and
what<00:02:07.649> I<00:02:07.680> mean<00:02:07.829> by<00:02:07.890> that<00:02:08.190> like<00:02:08.399> we<00:02:08.580> saw<00:02:08.849> it<00:02:09.000> once

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
what I mean by that like we saw it once

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.350

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.570 
attacking influence Carlos bacca
actually<00:04:26.250> once<00:04:26.400> I

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
actually once I

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.270 
actually once I
and<00:04:26.639> you<00:04:26.699> could<00:04:26.879> see<00:04:27.180> a<00:04:27.210> sprint<00:04:28.189> just<00:04:29.189> the

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
and you could see a sprint just the

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.520 
and you could see a sprint just the
speed<00:04:29.669> going<00:04:30.120> very<00:04:30.360> well<00:04:30.479> for<00:04:30.689> him<00:04:31.080> right<00:04:31.470> now

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
speed going very well for him right now

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.950 
speed going very well for him right now
and<00:04:31.680> I<00:04:32.460> think<00:04:32.970> he's<00:04:33.210> definitely<00:04:33.689> going<00:04:33.780> to<00:04:33.870> be

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
and I think he's definitely going to be

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.730 
and I think he's definitely going to be
an<00:04:34.050> influential<00:04:34.500> player<00:04:34.949> for<00:04:35.909> the<00:04:36.210> season<00:04:36.810> we

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
an influential player for the season we

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.179 
an influential player for the season we
also<00:04:37.889> saw<00:04:38.280> the<00:04:38.340> entry<00:04:39.120> of<00:04:39.150> other<00:04:39.930> players<00:04:40.289> such

also saw the entry of other players such

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:42.850 
also saw the entry of other players such
as<00:04:41.219> onda<00:04:41.969> playing<00:04:42.240> as<00:04:42.419> a<00:04:42.449> trequartista

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
as onda playing as a trequartista

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.980 
as onda playing as a trequartista
finally<00:04:43.860> hidden<00:04:44.129> is<00:04:44.250> a<00:04:44.280> position<00:04:45.150> rather<00:04:45.840> than

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
finally hidden is a position rather than

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.580 
finally hidden is a position rather than
in<00:04:46.319> midfield<00:04:46.620> and<00:04:47.330> honor<00:04:48.330> did<00:04:48.689> actually<00:04:48.960> quite

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
in midfield and honor did actually quite

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.290 
in midfield and honor did actually quite
nice<00:04:49.800> in<00:04:50.039> that<00:04:50.189> position<00:04:50.430> so<00:04:50.909> it<00:04:51.000> could<00:04:51.150> be<00:04:51.270> a

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
nice in that position so it could be a

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.959 
nice in that position so it could be a
good<00:04:51.599> alternative<00:04:51.750> to<00:04:52.409> me<00:04:53.129> be<00:04:53.189> born<00:04:53.520> Aventura

00:04:53.959 --> 00:04:53.969 
good alternative to me be born Aventura

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:57.200 
good alternative to me be born Aventura
in<00:04:54.210> that<00:04:54.360> position<00:04:54.569> or<00:04:55.699> whoever<00:04:56.699> else<00:04:56.819> it

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
in that position or whoever else it

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.149 
in that position or whoever else it
would<00:04:57.360> be<00:04:57.569> so<00:04:58.080> it's<00:04:58.319> good<00:04:58.500> to<00:04:58.530> see<00:04:58.830> that<00:04:58.860> on

00:04:59.149 --> 00:04:59.159 
would be so it's good to see that on

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:01.490 
would be so it's good to see that on
this<00:04:59.370> kind<00:04:59.699> of<00:04:59.759> picking<00:05:00.090> up<00:05:00.210> is<00:05:00.419> formed<00:05:00.930> yet
