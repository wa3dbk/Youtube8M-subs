00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:08.010
 Hello, I have been here for half a year already. 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:11.759
 This digital tuner has been working for a long time 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:14.429
 for computer beta 2 drops on 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:18.300
 aliexpress principle im very pleased 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:21.119
 cost about 1000 rubles well, different 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.550
 sellers in different ways in the kit helicopter 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.619
 cartoon 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:28.980
 everything works fine driver disk on 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.109
 drivers we are fine in principle 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.059
 not bad if you go to the tower 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.239
 that is enough if the signal is not very 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.520
 labor children external antenna can 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.700
 just strip a piece of cable there 10 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.230
 centimeters at the end everything will catch 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.629
 the lack of this is genaro the only one 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.280
 the fact that there is no manual setting that is 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.640
 if the automation did not find 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.039
 signal he will have to blindly look for where he is 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.280
 maybe as if I caught it all 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.739
 well you need to have patience where 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.899
 I understand the antenna of the bundle 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.049
 need to settle remote well or in this 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:08.070
 but the interface and the interface let's 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:10.799
 look at the interface after 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.650
 installation shows us what role 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:17.720
 we have a signal what channel goes with how much 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:22.770
 How long is the transfer list channel 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:24.720
 can be removed and so cause say 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:29.780
 vaguely the first hour of the channel we are 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.780
 shows what programs when about what 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:40.330
 what else I wrote out the sound so as not to interfere 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:43.960
 here open the files that recorded it 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:46.720
 Comes in the picture channel video recording - 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:50.800
 channel plus previous channel volume 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.690
 menu well timeshift time shift gone 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.700
 somewhere back then they could 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.480
 see this place later 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.640
 rewind advertising even convenient 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:08.710
 teletext aspect ratio subtitles 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:11.770
 audio language leads root settings here 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.810
 this does not cause a scan I chose 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.410
 strange germany because here it is not 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.040
 only 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:20.350
 Channel video can be caught but also fm. 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:26.340
 If you choose Russia, then on my all the videos 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:30.820
 channels and who has this radio schedule 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:33.220
 when what can be recorded or source 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:36.910
 the signal is now digital 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:39.550
 television digital audio nothing 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:45.730
 goes usually the radio is caught here in this 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:48.940
 capture setting mode where what in 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.959
 what format video quality brightness 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.959
 contrast and all that 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:03:00.870
 interesting thing is the only minus 1 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:04.180
 the program is that she does not have me as 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:07.780
 stretching the screen here is the ratio 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.430
 It means that now itâ€™s going like four 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.430
 to three and inside in this four to three 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.290
 picture 1609 and and it would be good to cut 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:20.140
 to avoid these black stripes 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:22.660
 around the video there is no such force 16 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:25.510
 on 9 you put people stretching like this 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.180
 This problem can be solved if 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.410
 look through windows media center 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.459
 let's pre-build of course 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.459
 let's see how it will look 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.650
 when watching the video, press right 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:42.810
 button appears the menu and put it on 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.480
 right 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.430
 there appears in the menu increase here 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.370
 there are several options here we choose 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:53.209
 enlarge 2 and we have a picture 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.980
 ideally 16 on 9 why are they to the screens 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.410
 what is not in the native software is this 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.209
 tiunova 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.480
 thanks for watching like up 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.480
