00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:12.150 
here and today I've got kind of a
different<00:00:10.419> video<00:00:10.509> for<00:00:10.809> you<00:00:10.929> guys<00:00:10.959> so<00:00:11.799> I<00:00:11.829> was

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:16.480 
you're seeing this video and I was

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.050 
you're seeing this video and I was
getting<00:00:16.779> really<00:00:17.289> really<00:00:17.679> frustrated<00:00:17.949> I<00:00:18.670> was

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:19.060 
getting really really frustrated I was

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.839 
getting really really frustrated I was
turning<00:00:19.269> as<00:00:19.509> fast<00:00:19.840> as<00:00:20.019> I<00:00:20.140> could<00:00:20.199> and<00:00:20.769> I<00:00:21.550> could

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:21.849 
turning as fast as I could and I could

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:23.490 
turning as fast as I could and I could
not<00:00:22.090> get<00:00:22.300> any<00:00:22.480> good<00:00:22.630> times<00:00:22.900> was<00:00:23.050> getting<00:00:23.380> like

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:23.500 
not get any good times was getting like

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.189 
not get any good times was getting like
22<00:00:23.920> 23<00:00:23.949> s<00:00:24.519> consistently<00:00:25.150> so<00:00:25.810> said<00:00:25.990> you<00:00:26.080> know

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:26.199 
22 23 s consistently so said you know

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:29.249 
22 23 s consistently so said you know
what<00:00:26.410> I'm<00:00:26.830> going<00:00:27.310> to<00:00:27.400> slow<00:00:27.880> down<00:00:27.910> and<00:00:28.509> do<00:00:28.810> some

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:29.259 
what I'm going to slow down and do some

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:31.800 
what I'm going to slow down and do some
super<00:00:29.830> slow<00:00:30.039> solves<00:00:30.609> and<00:00:30.820> just<00:00:31.359> try<00:00:31.599> to<00:00:31.660> be

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:31.810 
super slow solves and just try to be

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.479 
super slow solves and just try to be
consistent<00:00:32.439> and<00:00:32.529> see<00:00:32.770> how<00:00:32.890> that<00:00:33.039> works<00:00:33.250> out

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:33.489 
consistent and see how that works out

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:37.529 
consistent and see how that works out
and<00:00:34.710> unbelievably<00:00:35.710> guys<00:00:35.950> almost<00:00:36.940> got<00:00:37.149> a<00:00:37.180> sub

00:00:37.529 --> 00:00:37.539 
and unbelievably guys almost got a sub

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:41.819 
and unbelievably guys almost got a sub
19<00:00:38.020> average<00:00:38.440> of<00:00:38.559> 5<00:00:38.800> so<00:00:39.760> I<00:00:39.789> got<00:00:40.239> at<00:00:40.480> 19<00:00:41.260> point<00:00:41.559> 1<00:00:41.800> 3

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:41.829 
19 average of 5 so I got at 19 point 1 3

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:45.750 
19 average of 5 so I got at 19 point 1 3
I<00:00:42.100> think<00:00:42.219> average<00:00:42.969> of<00:00:43.420> 5<00:00:43.809> slow<00:00:44.649> turning<00:00:45.219> now

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
I think average of 5 slow turning now

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.479 
I think average of 5 slow turning now
the<00:00:45.820> first<00:00:46.180> solve<00:00:46.420> there<00:00:46.600> was<00:00:46.719> a<00:00:46.750> 21<00:00:47.289> I<00:00:47.859> just

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:48.489 
the first solve there was a 21 I just

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:50.130 
the first solve there was a 21 I just
started<00:00:48.820> doing<00:00:48.969> this<00:00:49.210> though<00:00:49.420> and<00:00:49.660> I<00:00:49.690> was<00:00:49.840> you

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
started doing this though and I was you

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.330 
started doing this though and I was you
know<00:00:50.170> I<00:00:50.289> was<00:00:50.500> pretty<00:00:50.649> happy<00:00:50.890> with<00:00:51.039> that<00:00:51.100> time

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:51.340 
know I was pretty happy with that time

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:52.470 
know I was pretty happy with that time
to<00:00:51.460> be<00:00:51.550> honest<00:00:51.760> with<00:00:51.850> you<00:00:52.030> because<00:00:52.149> that's

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
to be honest with you because that's

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.540 
to be honest with you because that's
what<00:00:52.600> I<00:00:52.629> was<00:00:52.809> getting<00:00:53.140> whenever<00:00:53.859> I<00:00:53.949> was<00:00:54.160> doing

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.550 
what I was getting whenever I was doing

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.090 
what I was getting whenever I was doing
fast<00:00:55.120> turning<00:00:55.629> but<00:00:56.199> as<00:00:56.379> you<00:00:56.500> can<00:00:56.649> see<00:00:56.710> I'm

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
fast turning but as you can see I'm

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.389 
fast turning but as you can see I'm
turning<00:00:57.489> super<00:00:58.030> slow<00:00:58.329> and<00:00:58.660> I'm<00:00:59.590> just<00:01:00.010> seeing

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:00.399 
turning super slow and I'm just seeing

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:03.630 
turning super slow and I'm just seeing
the<00:01:00.489> pair's<00:01:00.789> look<00:01:01.329> at<00:01:01.420> that<00:01:01.570> a<00:01:01.829> 15.4<00:01:02.829> slow

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
the pair's look at that a 15.4 slow

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.580 
the pair's look at that a 15.4 slow
turning<00:01:04.150> now<00:01:04.570> this<00:01:04.750> just<00:01:04.930> goes<00:01:05.049> to<00:01:05.199> show<00:01:05.530> you

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
turning now this just goes to show you

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.530 
turning now this just goes to show you
guys<00:01:05.920> that<00:01:06.310> if<00:01:06.400> you<00:01:06.520> work<00:01:06.700> on<00:01:06.850> your<00:01:06.909> look<00:01:07.180> ahead

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
guys that if you work on your look ahead

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.710 
guys that if you work on your look ahead
and<00:01:07.810> you<00:01:08.560> practice<00:01:09.159> you<00:01:09.729> can<00:01:09.939> definitely<00:01:10.180> get

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
and you practice you can definitely get

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.070 
and you practice you can definitely get
sub<00:01:11.080> 15<00:01:11.619> even<00:01:12.159> if<00:01:12.369> you<00:01:12.460> don't<00:01:12.640> turn<00:01:13.000> fast<00:01:13.420> so

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
sub 15 even if you don't turn fast so

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.569 
sub 15 even if you don't turn fast so
that's<00:01:14.409> something<00:01:14.650> that<00:01:14.890> I<00:01:14.920> need<00:01:15.220> to<00:01:15.310> keep<00:01:15.430> in

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:15.579 
that's something that I need to keep in

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:17.550 
that's something that I need to keep in
my<00:01:15.700> head<00:01:15.970> and<00:01:16.210> I<00:01:16.600> definitely<00:01:17.079> need<00:01:17.170> to<00:01:17.200> do<00:01:17.439> this

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
my head and I definitely need to do this

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.230 
my head and I definitely need to do this
when<00:01:17.799> I'm<00:01:17.950> at<00:01:18.130> a<00:01:18.159> competition<00:01:18.670> because<00:01:19.119> I've

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
when I'm at a competition because I've

got one coming up this video was

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:22.620 
got one coming up this video was
actually<00:01:20.950> inspired<00:01:21.640> by<00:01:21.820> an<00:01:22.119> old<00:01:22.270> video<00:01:22.570> of

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
actually inspired by an old video of

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.020 
actually inspired by an old video of
cubics<00:01:23.259> --is<00:01:23.439> i<00:01:23.619> don't<00:01:23.799> know<00:01:23.979> if<00:01:24.790> you<00:01:24.939> guys

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
cubics --is i don't know if you guys

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.539 
cubics --is i don't know if you guys
have<00:01:25.240> seen<00:01:25.390> it<00:01:25.450> or<00:01:25.659> not<00:01:25.810> but<00:01:26.079> he<00:01:26.229> gets<00:01:26.470> a<00:01:26.740> 16

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:27.549 
have seen it or not but he gets a 16

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:29.460 
have seen it or not but he gets a 16
second<00:01:27.970> soft<00:01:28.210> turn<00:01:28.600> and<00:01:28.780> super<00:01:29.079> slow<00:01:29.290> like

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
second soft turn and super slow like

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.069 
second soft turn and super slow like
this<00:01:29.710> and<00:01:30.040> he<00:01:30.100> made<00:01:30.250> a<00:01:30.280> video<00:01:30.460> about<00:01:30.700> it<00:01:30.880> and<00:01:31.119> it

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:32.079 
this and he made a video about it and it

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:33.810 
this and he made a video about it and it
just<00:01:32.170> goes<00:01:32.470> to<00:01:32.649> show<00:01:32.710> you<00:01:32.890> guys<00:01:33.100> you<00:01:33.670> know<00:01:33.790> you

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
just goes to show you guys you know you

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.569 
just goes to show you guys you know you
don't<00:01:34.149> have<00:01:34.329> to<00:01:34.509> be<00:01:34.799> super<00:01:35.799> fast<00:01:36.040> or<00:01:36.369> have<00:01:36.549> a

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:36.579 
don't have to be super fast or have a

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:38.999 
don't have to be super fast or have a
really<00:01:36.880> high<00:01:37.180> turn<00:01:37.570> per<00:01:37.780> second<00:01:38.229> in<00:01:38.380> order<00:01:38.890> to

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
really high turn per second in order to

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.120 
really high turn per second in order to
be<00:01:39.189> a<00:01:39.369> fast<00:01:39.670> cuber<00:01:40.090> now<00:01:40.240> it<00:01:40.420> helps<00:01:40.840> but<00:01:41.799> it's

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
be a fast cuber now it helps but it's

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.399 
be a fast cuber now it helps but it's
not<00:01:42.369> necessary<00:01:43.030> and<00:01:43.240> this<00:01:43.840> is<00:01:43.990> something<00:01:44.380> that

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
not necessary and this is something that

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:46.109 
not necessary and this is something that
I<00:01:44.530> think<00:01:44.649> I'm<00:01:44.890> gonna<00:01:45.040> keep<00:01:45.250> doing<00:01:45.520> until<00:01:45.820> my

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
I think I'm gonna keep doing until my

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:48.749 
I think I'm gonna keep doing until my
competition<00:01:46.780> just<00:01:47.380> slow<00:01:47.680> solves<00:01:48.280> and<00:01:48.490> try<00:01:48.700> to

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
competition just slow solves and try to

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:50.819 
competition just slow solves and try to
be<00:01:48.969> super<00:01:49.390> smooth<00:01:49.689> and<00:01:50.110> I<00:01:50.350> think<00:01:50.619> it'll<00:01:50.740> help

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:50.829 
be super smooth and I think it'll help

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:53.700 
be super smooth and I think it'll help
my<00:01:51.070> times<00:01:51.399> I<00:01:51.820> don't<00:01:52.149> see<00:01:52.600> how<00:01:52.899> it<00:01:53.079> couldn't<00:01:53.350> and

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
my times I don't see how it couldn't and

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.639 
my times I don't see how it couldn't and
I'm<00:01:54.640> really<00:01:54.969> excited<00:01:55.119> because<00:01:55.630> I<00:01:56.259> hope<00:01:56.469> that<00:01:56.619> I

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
I'm really excited because I hope that I

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:58.200 
I'm really excited because I hope that I
found<00:01:56.979> a<00:01:57.189> practice<00:01:57.610> method<00:01:57.969> that<00:01:58.090> will

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
found a practice method that will

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.819 
found a practice method that will
actually<00:01:58.329> help<00:01:58.719> me<00:01:58.930> but<00:01:59.350> I've<00:01:59.469> still<00:01:59.619> got<00:01:59.680> a

00:01:59.819 --> 00:01:59.829 
actually help me but I've still got a

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:01.950 
actually help me but I've still got a
few<00:02:00.100> more<00:02:00.250> OLS<00:02:00.850> to<00:02:00.969> learn<00:02:01.090> before<00:02:01.299> I<00:02:01.450> leave<00:02:01.659> I

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
few more OLS to learn before I leave I

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.410 
few more OLS to learn before I leave I
think<00:02:02.229> I've<00:02:02.409> learned<00:02:02.619> 9<00:02:02.979> or<00:02:03.189> 10<00:02:03.369> of<00:02:03.399> the<00:02:03.640> 19<00:02:04.149> I

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
think I've learned 9 or 10 of the 19 I

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.969 
think I've learned 9 or 10 of the 19 I
just<00:02:04.899> don't<00:02:05.049> want<00:02:05.170> to<00:02:05.229> cram<00:02:05.439> them<00:02:05.590> in<00:02:05.680> my<00:02:05.770> head

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
just don't want to cram them in my head

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:07.960 
just don't want to cram them in my head
I<00:02:06.009> want<00:02:06.280> to<00:02:06.340> be<00:02:06.430> comfortable<00:02:06.700> with<00:02:07.060> them

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
I want to be comfortable with them

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.279 
I want to be comfortable with them
it's<00:02:08.270> not<00:02:08.479> something<00:02:08.720> that<00:02:08.899> I<00:02:08.990> want<00:02:09.140> to<00:02:09.170> have

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
it's not something that I want to have

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.200 
it's not something that I want to have
to<00:02:09.380> sit<00:02:09.590> there<00:02:09.740> and<00:02:09.860> think<00:02:10.039> about<00:02:10.340> doing<00:02:10.580> so

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 
to sit there and think about doing so

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:12.580 
to sit there and think about doing so
I've<00:02:11.330> still<00:02:11.510> got<00:02:11.630> some<00:02:11.660> pauses<00:02:12.050> in<00:02:12.440> these

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
I've still got some pauses in these

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.160 
I've still got some pauses in these
songs<00:02:12.860> and<00:02:13.250> it<00:02:13.400> wasn't<00:02:13.610> perfect<00:02:14.020> but<00:02:15.020> it's

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
songs and it wasn't perfect but it's

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.300 
songs and it wasn't perfect but it's
just<00:02:15.350> something<00:02:15.650> I<00:02:15.709> wanted<00:02:15.920> to<00:02:16.010> share<00:02:16.190> with
