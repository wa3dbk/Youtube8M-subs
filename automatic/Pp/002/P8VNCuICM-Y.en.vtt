you<00:02:53.840> say<00:02:54.019> to<00:02:54.079> me<00:02:54.290> you<00:02:55.010> actually<00:02:55.130> get<00:02:55.430> a<00:02:55.459> bit<00:02:55.640> of

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
you say to me you actually get a bit of

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.339 
you say to me you actually get a bit of
oversteer<00:02:56.030> going<00:02:56.599> because<00:02:56.840> you<00:02:56.989> could<00:02:57.140> duck

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:57.349 
oversteer going because you could duck

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:00.039 
oversteer going because you could duck
it<00:02:57.500> in<00:02:57.620> that's<00:02:57.829> so<00:02:58.010> quickly<00:02:58.549> the<00:02:59.120> acceleration

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049 
it in that's so quickly the acceleration

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:02.350 
it in that's so quickly the acceleration
is<00:03:00.230> 0<00:03:00.620> I<00:03:01.040> mean<00:03:01.310> it's<00:03:01.459> it's<00:03:01.910> like<00:03:02.000> bit<00:03:02.180> on<00:03:02.269> the

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
is 0 I mean it's it's like bit on the

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.240 
is 0 I mean it's it's like bit on the
blade<00:03:02.540> but<00:03:02.810> without<00:03:03.019> being<00:03:03.319> fully<00:03:03.739> down<00:03:03.980> over

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
blade but without being fully down over

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.220 
blade but without being fully down over
the<00:03:04.340> front<00:03:04.549> wheel<00:03:04.730> so<00:03:05.510> you<00:03:05.569> can<00:03:05.750> imagine<00:03:05.840> it's

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
the front wheel so you can imagine it's

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.319 
the front wheel so you can imagine it's
pretty<00:03:06.379> outrageous<00:03:07.160> it<00:03:07.489> wants<00:03:07.700> to<00:03:07.790> lift<00:03:07.940> up<00:03:08.180> it

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:08.329 
pretty outrageous it wants to lift up it

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:09.490 
pretty outrageous it wants to lift up it
