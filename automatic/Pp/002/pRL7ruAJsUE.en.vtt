00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:12.250
 Well, dear gardeners next stage 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:16.600
 sweet cherry development 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:18.699
 Formation Spanish previous cost 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.920
 we looked there was cropped 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:23.110
 here it was done before pinching yes 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:27.600
 here you see here withered here 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:30.250
 shoots and here are more mature mature 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:33.399
 increment and that's what's special 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:36.250
 such here already on this bush 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:40.269
 let's form something around the 20th century 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:45.219
 about 20 years as it turns out 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:47.620
 Next we are the weakest 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:49.899
 probably we leave now we leave 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.420
 50 centimeters from growth blames 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:55.899
 we cut off at the same level on these branches 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:59.109
 already on these branches next year so far 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:03.519
 may still be at the beginning these will be in 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:09.220
 this how its fruits at the beginning began in 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:10.390
 beginning to the base of the branches of the base of the water 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.320
 there will still be on these horizontal 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:19.469
 branches which will already be arc gave 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.680
 wood after next year know 

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:23.320
 there is 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.539
 recalculation such a 50 more 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.570
 centimeters we at this meeting year will be 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:31.869
 I do not live 10 to a second that is lateral 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.880
 broken twigs and fruits are so well 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:35.679
 here there is a different development 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.770
 sprigs thin and thick and thin 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:40.719
 twigs will remove no thin 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.850
 you can not remove the branches yet 

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:44.979
 they don't thicken yet 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.710
 what about condensation can remove there already 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:51.039
 can be on thin branches already here 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.469
 there will be fruiting so for this 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:55.689
 there is harvest aid 

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:57.249
 so if all now and delete accept 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:59.890
 here the situation is often all 

00:01:57.249 --> 00:02:02.560
 remove from this will go again all this 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.280
 growth that is necessary to force spread to these 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.610
 on 2 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.540
 but the 21st is not such a question 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.630
 such 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.700
 forming it is beneficial for us so that 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.940
 here these creep on making branches they 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.670
 under the snow there are these gentle yes 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:24.810
 they will be under the snow that is 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:27.550
 in any case, the harvest is probably even 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:31.650
 see, I can't say that when 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:35.920
 that's when they put out after 3 this year 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.420
 rs4 grass got out and 38-39 well 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.500
 briefly if long will 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:43.780
 just do not understand anything and even with 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.150
 after 38 39 fruited 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:51.190
 brought that is also nothing when 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:54.220
 sometimes it happens when u is over 40 42 already 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:57.790
 to something with respect and here 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:00.060
 what the situation is due to the fact that if 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:04.480
 will even be extreme something 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.620
 some sharp drops let's say -45 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.140
 everything will freeze 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:12.130
 accounting snow page cut off the top 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:15.160
 for a couple of years root kaosan sleigh by they and 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:17.560
 immediately tramp understand understand so yet 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.980
 I have such a question these sections and why 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:24.850
 are processing 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:26.250
 you need to cut it off 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:30.120
 process 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.120
 there is such a gardener 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:37.580
 Zlatoust he developed his some 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:40.930
 means mister mastic bridge 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:43.180
 mastic Dolmatova to mind so that's 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.800
 once ordered 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.490
 a small parcel on used me 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:52.750
 began to run out but younger is bigger 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:56.060
 A little expensive of course convenient there based 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:58.550
 birch tar still fall i still 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:02.030
 heard there is such a putty called 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:07.370
 No wounds I, she, too, on the basis of birch 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:11.290
 tar sealant putty and it must be handed 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:15.050
 it is gloved you can any weather 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:19.210
 You can of course have Kramarenko 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:20.360
 cover up the whole rally you have varnish 

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:24.140
 apricot 

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:26.570
 you can buy cheap if nothing 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:29.270
 thread stocks and smear seriously well here 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:32.540
 Take another look at this the forming shop 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:36.530
 have you see that crown form such 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:39.260
 the bowl or vocal has a prominent shape 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:44.000
 low funds here here not even 60 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:46.610
 centimeters to understand differently differently 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.220
 at first I did not know what Che would like now! 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:51.800
 the usual to think what satu happy about 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:54.080
 there is a relationship which formulating 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.560
 if you will form let's say 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.630
 searched 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.940
 Spanish taste you need a strain of what was 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:01.460
 more for meters fifty seventy 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.330
 strain what was if you shape 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.940
 Kigi by 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:08.600
 that the side branches are cut off all 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:11.870
 vertical go then you can even 30 after 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:15.590
 30 exhibit means doing there 30 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:17.840
 means from the ground when salt is planted 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:20.300
 should be about 50 dry then 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:23.240
 Understand the height of the thread Well, that's expensive 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:27.530
 gardeners if someone has something left 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:30.490
 unclear ask questions vladimir 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:34.070
 A. Sheremetyev through our site 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:37.660
 will answer 7 and you will also be able to grow 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.660
 such a beautiful sweet cherry
