the area this is where the flag is and

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.650 
the area this is where the flag is and
everything<00:00:47.550> we<00:00:47.670> just<00:00:47.910> jump<00:00:48.090> under<00:00:48.300> this<00:00:48.420> crate

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
everything we just jump under this crate

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.630 
everything we just jump under this crate
with<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.230> tarp<00:00:49.469> or<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:49.980> don't<00:00:50.250> fits<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.430> crate

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.980 
me fade too when I got it I think the
sweet<00:01:41.040> spot<00:01:41.310> is<00:01:41.549> right<00:01:42.270> on<00:01:42.390> this<00:01:42.509> bridge<00:01:42.780> here

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
sweet spot is right on this bridge here

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.690 
sweet spot is right on this bridge here
otherwise<00:01:43.229> you're<00:01:43.530> too<00:01:43.710> close<00:01:44.040> or<00:01:44.280> too<00:01:44.310> far

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
otherwise you're too close or too far

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.730 
otherwise you're too close or too far
and<00:01:44.939> then<00:01:45.600> obviously<00:01:46.020> I'm<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.170> bridge<00:01:46.500> for

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
and then obviously I'm the bridge for

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.130 
and then obviously I'm the bridge for
good<00:01:46.860> measure<00:01:47.840> the<00:01:48.840> next<00:01:49.470> one<00:01:49.619> is<00:01:49.829> on<00:01:50.009> warlord

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
good measure the next one is on warlord

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.289 
good measure the next one is on warlord
which<00:01:52.140> is<00:01:52.350> in<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.829> corner<00:01:53.159> of<00:01:53.340> yellow<00:01:53.729> base<00:01:53.939> so

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
which is in the corner of yellow base so

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.149 
which is in the corner of yellow base so
you<00:01:54.390> just<00:01:54.509> get<00:01:54.630> up<00:01:54.780> in<00:01:55.229> yellow<00:01:55.500> base<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:56.009> it's

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
you just get up in yellow base and it's

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.550 
you just get up in yellow base and it's
right<00:01:56.310> in<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.430> corner<00:01:56.640> there

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
right in the corner there

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.190 
right in the corner there
you<00:01:58.560> could<00:01:58.680> even<00:01:58.770> shoot<00:01:59.009> it<00:01:59.070> with<00:01:59.159> a<00:01:59.189> pistol<00:02:00.200> by

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
you could even shoot it with a pistol by

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.209 
you could even shoot it with a pistol by
the<00:02:01.290> way<00:02:01.409> I<00:02:01.439> used<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:02.490> snipers<00:02:03.619> settings<00:02:04.619> for

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
the way I used the snipers settings for

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.330 
the way I used the snipers settings for
each<00:02:05.250> game<00:02:05.579> I'm<00:02:06.000> just<00:02:06.299> playing<00:02:06.479> custom<00:02:06.780> games

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
each game I'm just playing custom games

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.469 
each game I'm just playing custom games
so<00:02:08.340> it's<00:02:08.459> easier<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:08.729> shoot<00:02:09.149> with<00:02:09.270> a<00:02:09.300> sniper

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
so it's easier to shoot with a sniper

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.999 
so it's easier to shoot with a sniper
for<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.929> Far<00:02:10.080> Away<00:02:10.110> ones<00:02:10.410> especially<00:02:10.860> like

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
for the Far Away ones especially like

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.130 
for the Far Away ones especially like
this<00:02:11.129> one<00:02:11.340> so<00:02:12.030> you<00:02:12.090> want<00:02:12.270> to<00:02:12.330> look

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.200 
this one so you want to look
past<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.800> base<00:02:14.010> that<00:02:14.490> doesn't<00:02:14.820> have<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.060> big

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
past the base that doesn't have the big

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.250 
past the base that doesn't have the big
waterfall<00:02:15.480> and<00:02:16.280> rocks<00:02:17.280> behind<00:02:17.460> it

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
waterfall and rocks behind it

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.780

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
immediately behind it and it's just

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.540 
immediately behind it and it's just
