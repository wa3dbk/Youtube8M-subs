 the nerves insecurities of the first 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:27.340
 photographic work payment is always the 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.230

 control this good before you start 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:36.370
 with the video I'm going to show you two 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.290
 examples from my first photo shoot 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.600
 pay in colombia and my first session of 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:43.809
 photos pay in argentina and programming 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.790
 of pictures paid for a lifetime was here in 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:47.890
 my city in Armenia I did a little bit to 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.820
 an irrational model occasion we had 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:53.500
 to the place and everything takes an assistant 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.420
 try to plan as much as possible 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.340
 obviously I'm very nervous and what 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.290
 he sent me was given during the session 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.840
 of pictures I was really scared because I did not 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.649
 they knew how to guide the girl well 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:07.659
 I knew where to position the lights 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:20.679
 perfect since I keep an example of 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:22.659
 all these photos I did to my 

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:25.929
 first session of photos pagán argentina 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:28.990
 they were fashion photos for a campaign of 

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:30.670
 a spring summer clothes store and 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.039
 this good photo session I already had more 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.170
 experience that other books had made 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:37.479
 no payments but I have made other books and 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.819
 works then with this plan 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.380
 much more but nevertheless the day the 

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:44.380
 session was very afraid because it was the 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.840
 the first time I photographed 25 let's say 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.030
 attire in the same day had the 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.890
 the customer next to me we are in a 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.780
 education inside there were a lot of people 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.420
 but I think what worked best for him here 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.860
 was that we hired a model with the 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.860
 that I had worked before 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.869
 likewise the advice is to pretend to pretend and 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:13.440
 pretend if I believe a lot in that when 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.840
 one pretends to be sure a point comes in 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.000
 where this pretense becomes a reality 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.310
 and for a client the most important thing is 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.100
 sit in front of a photographer according to a 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.560
 photographer that shows that he knows how to do 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.700
 things and you're dying of the 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.860
 blacks this shake hands 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.810
 performer tremble legs blood 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.910
 party makes fear and converts 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.700
 insecurity insurance samples show yourself 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.959
 confident speak slowly and if you 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.970
 they hire to do something that they do not 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.800
 they have a lot of quiet experience 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.690
 you have two options the first option is 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.850
 internet internet is a database 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.220
 Giant where you can put e 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.230
 investigate everything about it and the second 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.390
 option is always the friends the 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.190
 photographers teachers yo 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.590
 Can you write me or can you 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.120
 ask a good friend to give tips 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.310
 also tips on how it illuminates the 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.510
 product or give me advice on what is it 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.610
 what should I consider for a session 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.280
 Fashion show sure samples of 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:09.370
 confident and everything pretty 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:11.350
 the first is to believe you have to believe that 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.880
 I can do things because I do not 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.030
 necessarily because it's your first 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.680
 Paid photo shoot is not because no 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.270
 have experience because you do not have 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.120
 stability because you're not a good 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:25.360
 photographer we all have a first time 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.310
 in everything and this first time can be very 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.530
 good or very bad and that depends on you 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.530
 Then, believe in your skills 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.780
 believe in that you can make the photos better 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.820
 in your life and my third advice is something 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.530
 that even today I do it but I think that 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.110
 for that first photo session back 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:44.410
 it's super important to feel safe 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:46.530
 to feel confident and plan the 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.450
 plan everything with a lot of anticipation 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.760
 starting from the lights plant 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.250
 make a check list of what you have to 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.570
 Take what you need to rent from 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.610
 this way you will not forget anything 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.800
 I'm going to see how the weather will be if it's going to 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.110
 rain if it's not going to rain and if they have the 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.420
 possibility go to the location where you are going to 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.180
 take the pictures and try to go to 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.950
 different hours 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.239
 to see how the light of this 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.519
 shape when the day arrives 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:13.950
 the photos will know where 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:15.840
 they want to make each picture what is good 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.120
 and many times in the photo sessions 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.299
 when its spontaneous corners is where 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.740
 the best photos come out but for that 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.660
 first photo action what you 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.120
 you want to feel confident calm 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.400
 then it is better to plan if they arise 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.009
 things are great but if they do not arise 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.330
 you have everything planned and finally I think 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:35.639
 which is very important for that first 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:38.070
 photo shoot bring a assistant one 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:40.020
 person who is willing to help me in 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.669
 everything that is an SUV but not 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.349
 take someone who has many 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:45.750
 more experiences that had to be a 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:47.430
 very expert photographer not because this is 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.949
 wrong but because maybe you can create it 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.870
 Insecurity can make you see more 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:54.210
 unsafe then it takes like that 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.610
 have confidence in someone who can 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:05:00.509
 help a friend an acquaintance and I think that 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:02.490
 the last thing is you have to breathe like 

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:04.470
 I always say a first time for everything 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.660
 and if you are calm and sure of your 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.280
 knowledge and you take everything in stride 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.560
 things will turn out well 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.300
 do not worry this is going to be something that 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.410
 it's going to happen constantly because every 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.479
 you will have bigger clients 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.120
 most important things and in this the 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:19.680
 things that do not have much experience 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.780
 So the point is to relax and 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.400
 believe in what you do so go and 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.770
 I hope you liked that and 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.720
