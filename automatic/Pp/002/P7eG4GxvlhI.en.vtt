00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.290
 internet or it's pretty cheaper 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.600
 look for stores that are not game and what 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.860
 contrary cheaper hours in sleep 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.409
 simply different ways to get there 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.229
 to white this heller based on the xbox 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.740
 in play 3 is simply go to the reader 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.899

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.990
 then you already look for it without problems there 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:29.250
 there is a brief explanation of what it brings 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.950

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.800
 tell what brings this there you see it good 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.530
 Well let's start at the beginning 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.649
 allows to have those who do not have the 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:50.620
 limited edition of lula co2 el new town 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:52.990
 zombie is to say I like the map 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.960
 it's not that it's very easy but not word 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.780
 that you have invested and it's a map of 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.820
 zombie extra and it's pretty good and then 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.910
 what interests us because it is profitable 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.350
 because we have free 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.870
 Man is not free because we have paid 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.200
 but we have all the dlc that they take out 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:15.490
 for black ops 2 we have them already 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:17.590
 paid and surely good insurance 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.810
 sure that like carlos useful this 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.440
 prize in modern warfare 3 we go to 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:26.500
 have about three days a couple of days 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.900
 before the maps that the rest of the 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.220
 people that the rest of the people 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.960
 that they put it with that they are going to 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.000
 to buy 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:36.040
 separately the dlc this one 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.409
 advantage 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.299
 apart mainly the advantage more 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:41.950
 important is that we saved pasta 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:45.250
 because you get much more profitable 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:49.049
 buy fabrics so separate and good 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:52.900
 or a sheet is added that they give you 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:54.310
 Well, when digging out when you buy the 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.109
 season pass of the black ops 2 then you 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.849
 They give away champagne is in the barracks 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:00.549
 this price and well this one does not have 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:02.889
 patience if you have any if you average 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:05.079
 egg some doubt then for the 

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:06.189
 comments and if it's not me I'm sure 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:09.579
 quality will respond 

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:13.329

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:17.040
