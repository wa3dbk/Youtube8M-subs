see that this popped out now with the

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.530 
see that this popped out now with the
10x<00:01:49.799> optical<00:01:49.950> zoom<00:01:50.280> see<00:01:51.149> if<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.270> can<00:01:51.390> do<00:01:51.450> this

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
10x optical zoom see if I can do this

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.130 
10x optical zoom see if I can do this
with<00:01:51.720> one<00:01:51.750> hand<00:01:53.299> ok<00:01:54.299> so<00:01:54.360> there<00:01:54.689> are<00:01:54.810> several

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
with one hand ok so there are several

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.010 
with one hand ok so there are several
modes<00:01:55.490> here<00:01:56.490> some<00:01:57.000> of<00:01:57.060> them<00:01:57.210> Pro<00:01:57.450> suggests<00:01:57.899> is

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
modes here some of them Pro suggests is

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.139 
modes here some of them Pro suggests is
a<00:01:58.049> really<00:01:58.380> cool<00:01:58.619> one<00:01:58.969> depending<00:01:59.969> on<00:02:00.060> the

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
a really cool one depending on the

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.999 
a really cool one depending on the
scenario<00:02:00.329> so<00:02:00.659> let's<00:02:00.930> we'll<00:02:01.229> shoot<00:02:01.439> here<00:02:01.829> you

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
scenario so let's we'll shoot here you

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.370 
scenario so let's we'll shoot here you
can<00:02:02.159> see<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.460> brought<00:02:02.640> up<00:02:02.790> vivid<00:02:03.780> color<00:02:03.990> strong

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
can see it brought up vivid color strong

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.429 
can see it brought up vivid color strong
color<00:02:04.649> color<00:02:05.280> transit<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.049> text<00:02:07.049> because<00:02:07.320> it

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
color color transit and text because it

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.930 
color color transit and text because it
thinks<00:02:07.619> it's<00:02:07.770> in<00:02:07.860> macro<00:02:08.190> mode<00:02:08.399> let's<00:02:08.610> say<00:02:08.759> I<00:02:08.789> go

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
thinks it's in macro mode let's say I go

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.600 
thinks it's in macro mode let's say I go
down<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.390> a<00:02:09.780> darker<00:02:10.470> situation<00:02:11.069> and<00:02:11.310> try<00:02:11.550> to

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
down to a darker situation and try to

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.090 
down to a darker situation and try to
focus<00:02:11.879> though<00:02:12.480> that<00:02:12.690> changes

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
focus though that changes

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.490 
focus though that changes
with<00:02:14.400> war<00:02:14.670> mode<00:02:14.880> blue<00:02:15.450> hue<00:02:15.750> sunrise<00:02:16.230> because

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
with war mode blue hue sunrise because

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.920 
with war mode blue hue sunrise because
it<00:02:16.620> thinks<00:02:16.830> I'm<00:02:16.950> in<00:02:17.130> a<00:02:17.580> darker<00:02:18.120> area<00:02:18.480> so<00:02:18.690> pretty

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
it thinks I'm in a darker area so pretty

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:19.370 
it thinks I'm in a darker area so pretty
cool

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
cool

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.940 
cool
there<00:02:20.010> also<00:02:20.640> it's<00:02:20.850> gonna<00:02:20.970> need<00:02:21.560> selfie<00:02:22.560> alarm

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
there also it's gonna need selfie alarm

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.470 
there also it's gonna need selfie alarm
it's<00:02:23.130> called<00:02:23.370> so<00:02:23.640> what<00:02:24.120> we<00:02:24.240> do<00:02:24.450> is<00:02:25.970> we<00:02:26.970> the

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
it's called so what we do is we the

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.059 
it's called so what we do is we the
screen<00:02:27.840> sets<00:02:28.080> up<00:02:28.200> right<00:02:28.380> there<00:02:28.560> with<00:02:28.709> a<00:02:28.740> box

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
screen sets up right there with a box

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.500 
screen sets up right there with a box
and<00:02:29.310> then<00:02:29.430> we're<00:02:29.640> gonna<00:02:29.730> try<00:02:29.940> to<00:02:30.030> get<00:02:30.240> in<00:02:30.390> that

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
and then we're gonna try to get in that

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.650 
and then we're gonna try to get in that
box<00:02:30.780> so<00:02:30.959> let's<00:02:31.020> let's<00:02:31.590> try<00:02:31.830> that<00:02:32.070> now<00:02:32.660> and

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
box so let's let's try that now and

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.330 
box so let's let's try that now and
you'll<00:02:33.810> hear<00:02:33.990> it<00:02:34.080> beep<00:02:34.350> three<00:02:34.680> times<00:02:34.920> we're<00:02:35.190> in

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
you'll hear it beep three times we're in

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:42.260 
you'll hear it beep three times we're in
focus<00:02:35.760> so<00:02:40.370> it<00:02:41.370> has<00:02:41.520> a<00:02:41.550> little<00:02:41.700> delay<00:02:42.000> because

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
focus so it has a little delay because

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.550 
focus so it has a little delay because
it<00:02:42.360> was<00:02:42.450> probably<00:02:42.750> looking<00:02:42.900> at<00:02:43.080> the<00:02:43.230> camera

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
it was probably looking at the camera

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.740 
it was probably looking at the camera
didn't<00:02:43.830> think<00:02:43.950> it<00:02:44.040> saw<00:02:44.190> my<00:02:44.340> face<00:02:44.550> but<00:02:44.850> uh<00:02:44.880> there

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
didn't think it saw my face but uh there

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.990 
didn't think it saw my face but uh there
I<00:02:45.780> am<00:02:46.230> so<00:02:46.530> you<00:02:46.590> can<00:02:46.800> use<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.190> nicer<00:02:47.520> camera<00:02:47.880> the

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
I am so you can use the nicer camera the

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.330 
I am so you can use the nicer camera the
