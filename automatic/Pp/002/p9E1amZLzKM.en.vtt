00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.949
 outstanding teachers on his lessons 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.809
 music go from before 1975 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.670
 and with pleasure the Soviet time 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.070
 his classes were broadcast throughout the country 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.930
 and now the teacher is not bothered 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.129
 approach to find children just important 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.650
 love them and your business 16 school 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:49.060
 it differs a lot 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:52.660
 the direction given by the first 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:57.970
 Director of the school and the money on the account is 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:01:01.900
 a man who knew what was not a sauna 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:03.820
 items form human philosophy 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.650
 schools subjects only help the child 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.540
 form your ideas about the world and 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.370
 draw the right conclusions from the only way 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.540
 man will come out man and this idea 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.760
 here they are trying to pass on from generation 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.350
 per generation probably that's why many 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.630
 graduates of different years after high school 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.180
 return to their native walls in each 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.470
 I know the classroom where I sat there 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.510
 in this classroom 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.240
 my workplace was after others to

 not only are they learning but sclera are learning now 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.890
 and represent life without computers 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.479
 smartphones and tablets and the teacher should 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.250
 be fully armed so the school 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:37.690
 libraries next to the shelves stand and 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.850
 electronic textbook discs 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.750
 interactive whiteboards appear in classrooms 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.300
 and projectors 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.070
 This is necessary because you can not retreat 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.590
 moving forward technical 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.039
 progress has its drawbacks 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.810
 on on that and teachers to account 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:56.940
 pedagogical components of what 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.940
 No, they can not give electronic technology 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.710

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.750

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.330
 they chase away the big school time after time 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.420

 dance numbers no songs no 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.989
 procured it gets things more 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.970
 prosaic for example you need to check everything 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:31.920
 is it ready for the celebration 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.049
