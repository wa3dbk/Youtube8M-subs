00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.310
 step by step just keep on watching 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.549

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.549
 need a picture frame like this 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:30.360
 preferably a married person who has 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:33.659
 a space between the photo and the frame a 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.520
 Punch I choose from my heart but 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.180
 you can choose any stamp that you 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.040
 If you do not have a 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.450
 You can make the hand but also the sticks 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.799
 accelerates too much process is much easier 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.930
 card a card I 'm using 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.820
 because I want to make the 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.090
 red hearts but you can also 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:57.450
 choose the color you want the card 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:02:00.409
 and a photo or any image 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.719
 You can print to reveal it to 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.810
 customize this portrait door 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:08.209
 so come on 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.429
 we have to do it then it's open here 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:13.069
 behind the picture frame 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:21.739
 then we will begin to love you that is 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:24.880
 our image and we will replace 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:24.880
 Why do we want to 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:37.610
 here I will use a cheat sheet that 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:40.660
 speak of materials a glue or durex I 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.660
 I think the glue looks better. 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:03:00.530
 while we wait to dry 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:03:08.830
 We just have to take paper and stick to the 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:08.830
 people went there rather than bored 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:23.310
 And then I'll use those little hearts. 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.940
 here we have to keep the 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.940
 hearts 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:43.739
 after you cut your hearts 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:48.450
 neighbors or any movie where you 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:50.610

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.090
 Our picture, then, to us. 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:04:06.420
 I'll put my little hearts together. 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:04:08.840

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.840
