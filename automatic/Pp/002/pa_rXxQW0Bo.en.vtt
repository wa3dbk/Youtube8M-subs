00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:13.340
 the most anticipated mp3 players 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:16.880
 this year because there would be this renewed 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.619
 since the end of 2010 cris judd ipod 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.349

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:27.279
 generation that was presented makes 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:31.159
 just two months and around September 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:33.710
 together with the iphone 5 and well we have 

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:35.660
 as you can see the box is the same as 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.410
 we have seen since the second generation 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.840
 of the ipod touch as you will remember the 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.180
 first generation in a box almost 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.100
 identical to the iphone 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:50.039
 and it is well in this 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:55.450
 have occasion we have an ipod touch of 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:57.610
 color white one gray pardon is gray gray 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.670
 crisis for this the back and 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:06.310
 white in front only more colors 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:10.460
 to the color pink green blue black this gray 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:13.220
 and a red one that is a decision 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.990
 network for 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:19.350
 for this 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.810
 of people coincidence is like a this 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.759
 to help the well-known people have me 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.080
 seen is a product that there are many 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.980
 products of these 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:32.700
 and we got to open it and we're going to open 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.700
 this part 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.610
 is 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.380
 is 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:49.539
 and we have the device 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:54.340
 in the foreground color is white and 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:57.009
 back is gray that comes is that color of 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:00.650
 aluminum not in both the gray circle yes 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:04.720
 It is not natural color of aluminum 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.720
 and we are going to check what it is that has 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.250
 we have these papers 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:16.600
 with a quick start 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:19.930
 some features we have the new 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.850
 cable that you will be able to know is a cable 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:26.670
 lighting 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:30.230
 this has finally dismissed the afternoon 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:33.650
 previous that was longer 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:37.870
 and it really is usb but as you can see 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.870
 it is more smaller 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.440
 let's try to focus it 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.350
 today is 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:52.380
 and we have this 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.230
 ribbon for 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:59.160
 for the doll because I explain how 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:04.970
 it gets and we have the new hearing aids and 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:08.510
 for a new apple design 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:12.310
 Obviously , they can buy themselves 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:14.600
 they sell them the 400 pesos 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.600
 and seeing in fault 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.600
 approximately 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:24.270
 and this is what we have in the box 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:27.350
 ok let's go to 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:29.380
 near day and 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.680
 and we have it 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:35.440
 let's remove the label from above 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:40.410
 it is not necessary to be able to remove the 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.410
 from here 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:49.050
 let's look here is we remove this 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.050
 plastic 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.060
 and obviously 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:04:01.080
 we are all this 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.080
 and he has already yielded can see 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.320
 As you can see it is very similar to 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:10.100
 previous front only a little more 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:13.100
 long in fact my my opinion I see it a 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:15.230
 little disproportionate as to what 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:20.120
 long when wide 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:23.169
 so practically not only what 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.169
 I stretch just like the iPhone 5 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:30.919
 that's my opinion I do not know about you 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:32.500
 have we have the back side can 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:35.380
 see that 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:38.200
 the color of aluminum we have a camera 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:40.990
 of 5 megapixels there site is the name 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.630
 that powers the camera with a flash 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.760
 led 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:48.290
 here we have the white antenna 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:51.290
 fighting the double band wifi 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:51.290
 wgn 

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:57.470
 and here we have in this part we have 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:01.450
 where we put the 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.450
 Cable the horn 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.470
 for the doll can see 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:15.300
 we only have the volume buttons as 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:18.470
 we have already seen in others 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.470
 Previous 8 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:26.020
 and from below we obviously have the new 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:31.420
 new connection lighting 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:34.140
 and disseminates the hearing aids and a speaker 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:36.610
 in front of this side we have nothing 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:40.300
 can see is thinner than the version 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:42.640
 previous but no longer has the aluminum 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:46.120
 polished that scratched practically nothing 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:48.910
 more to see it in this case we have with the 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:51.280
 natural aluminum 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:54.750
 compared to the other colors this is not 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.750
 Both traces are noticed 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:06:00.770
 I feel that I do feel that this part 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:02.480
 if it is going to grate, it has been issued 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:05.560
 done this already has about knows about 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.560
 small scratches 

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:11.689
 and well that 's practically everything we're going to 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.559
 see if he has 

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:14.559
 drums 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:22.090
 after being in a review of 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:24.190
 device to see all its functions 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:26.560
 and I will continue counting a bit quickly 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:29.520
 the features and in the vga camera 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.520
 for facetime 

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:35.990
 we can record in fact it's not a little 

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:40.470
 more is greater than bÃ©jar I think there is 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:43.880
 1.39 pixels we can record at 720p hd and 

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:47.760
 with the camera back we can record to 

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:52.550
 1080p has the same processor as the 

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:55.680
 iphone 4s 512 mb ram a screen 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:58.710
 1,136 x 640 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:02.039
 how can you see this width is this 

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:03.840
 same pixel ag new screen is not hd 

00:07:02.039 --> 00:07:05.820
 nor does this iphone girl actually have 

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:08.480
 the same resolution screen 

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:10.920
 screen than the iphone 5 

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:13.560
 obviously it's not hd 

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:16.529
 for the same reason that he did not want to change the 

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:18.809
 wide aspect so that only 

00:07:16.529 --> 00:07:20.150
 would have to modify the apps in what 

00:07:18.809 --> 00:07:22.910
 high 

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:25.820
 in some applications we can 

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:27.830
 see black bars above and below those that 

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:30.820
 they are not optimized but that is 

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:30.820
 will show in the review 

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:37.310
 and it's practically some of the 

00:07:33.889 --> 00:07:39.979
 basic characteristics in a review les 

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:42.740
 I will show all the features and 

00:07:39.979 --> 00:07:45.650
 functions and goods because you liked it 

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:49.009
 forget to subscribe to my channel follow me 

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:51.860

 see you in the next review of the 

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:57.280
 iphone ipod touch fifth generation
