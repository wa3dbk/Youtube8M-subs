so you'll probably post a small video on
his<00:01:42.260> bio<00:01:42.530> cube<00:01:42.970> he<00:01:43.970> just<00:01:44.180> did<00:01:44.300> a<00:01:44.330> teardown<00:01:44.630> over

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
his bio cube he just did a teardown over

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.469 
his bio cube he just did a teardown over
120<00:01:45.500> gallon<00:01:45.800> tank<00:01:46.070> and<00:01:46.370> so<00:01:46.610> he's<00:01:46.760> redoing<00:01:47.150> that

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
120 gallon tank and so he's redoing that

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.780

little close-up on this we actually have
a<00:02:18.560> quarter-inch<00:02:20.230> bulkhead<00:02:21.230> that<00:02:21.969> quarter

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:22.969 
a quarter-inch bulkhead that quarter

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:24.789 
a quarter-inch bulkhead that quarter
inch<00:02:23.120> in<00:02:23.389> and<00:02:23.569> quarter<00:02:23.840> inch<00:02:23.930> out<00:02:24.170> so<00:02:24.469> even<00:02:24.709> at

inch in and quarter inch out so even at

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:25.059 
inch in and quarter inch out so even at
the

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
the

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.190 
the
autum<00:02:25.310> we<00:02:26.120> have<00:02:26.269> quarter-inch<00:02:26.749> bulkheads

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
autum we have quarter-inch bulkheads

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.800 
autum we have quarter-inch bulkheads
that<00:02:27.379> release<00:02:28.189> ease<00:02:28.700> of<00:02:29.030> maintenance<00:02:29.239> so<00:02:29.659> you

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
that release ease of maintenance so you

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.720 
that release ease of maintenance so you
guys<00:02:29.989> can<00:02:30.260> definitely<00:02:30.409> maintain<00:02:31.189> and<00:02:31.400> clean

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
guys can definitely maintain and clean

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.750 
guys can definitely maintain and clean
the<00:02:32.060> entire<00:02:32.299> system<00:02:32.870> out<00:02:33.579> quarter<00:02:34.579> inch

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
the entire system out quarter inch

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.149 
the entire system out quarter inch
tubing<00:02:35.120> that<00:02:35.450> hits<00:02:35.749> directly<00:02:36.469> or<00:02:36.680> close<00:02:36.920> to

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:37.159 
tubing that hits directly or close to

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:39.280 
tubing that hits directly or close to
the<00:02:37.280> bottom<00:02:37.519> so<00:02:38.450> we<00:02:38.629> don't<00:02:38.810> pick<00:02:38.959> up<00:02:39.079> some<00:02:39.260> of

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
the bottom so we don't pick up some of

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.199 
the bottom so we don't pick up some of
the<00:02:39.409> debris<00:02:39.560> that<00:02:39.980> settles<00:02:40.340> at<00:02:40.459> the<00:02:40.489> bottom<00:02:40.579> at

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
the debris that settles at the bottom at

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.949 
the debris that settles at the bottom at
the<00:02:41.269> top<00:02:41.599> we<00:02:41.870> have<00:02:41.900> two<00:02:42.639> magnets<00:02:43.639> so<00:02:43.959> again

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
the top we have two magnets so again

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:46.479 
the top we have two magnets so again
left<00:02:45.230> and<00:02:45.439> right<00:02:45.650> these<00:02:45.829> magnets<00:02:46.370> actually

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
left and right these magnets actually

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.599 
left and right these magnets actually
clip<00:02:47.030> right<00:02:47.450> in<00:02:47.659> to<00:02:48.349> the<00:02:48.500> top<00:02:48.739> surface<00:02:49.189> so<00:02:49.459> that

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:49.609 
clip right in to the top surface so that

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:52.599 
clip right in to the top surface so that
clip<00:02:50.359> and<00:02:50.599> we're<00:02:51.019> good<00:02:51.139> to<00:02:51.260> go<00:02:51.290> and<00:02:51.650> that's<00:02:52.370> it

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:52.609 
clip and we're good to go and that's it

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:54.280 
clip and we're good to go and that's it
and<00:02:52.730> these<00:02:52.819> magnets<00:02:53.299> definitely<00:02:53.719> won't<00:02:53.959> come

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
and these magnets definitely won't come

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.140 
and these magnets definitely won't come
off<00:02:54.469> that's<00:02:55.129> a<00:02:55.310> good<00:02:55.459> thing<00:02:55.609> about<00:02:55.730> it<00:02:56.030> that

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
off that's a good thing about it that

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.479 
off that's a good thing about it that
just<00:02:56.419> positions<00:02:57.049> that<00:02:57.230> in<00:02:57.469> place<00:02:58.010> you<00:02:58.310> don't

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
just positions that in place you don't

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:01.270 
just positions that in place you don't
really<00:02:58.669> want<00:02:59.060> it<00:02:59.329> to<00:02:59.599> wobble<00:03:00.019> too<00:03:00.349> much<00:03:00.530> or

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
really want it to wobble too much or

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:07.689 
really want it to wobble too much or
shake<00:03:01.700> but<00:03:02.439> we<00:03:03.439> have<00:03:04.299> two<00:03:05.299> other<00:03:06.340> we<00:03:07.340> have<00:03:07.549> two
