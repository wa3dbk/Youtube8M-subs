thank you so tell us what happens during
an<00:00:19.050> eclipse<00:00:19.369> yes<00:00:20.369> well<00:00:20.640> when<00:00:20.850> you<00:00:20.939> see<00:00:21.180> the

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
an eclipse yes well when you see the

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.029 
an eclipse yes well when you see the
moon<00:00:21.630> shining<00:00:22.140> in<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.260> night<00:00:22.350> sky<00:00:22.470> you're

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
moon shining in the night sky you're

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.679 
moon shining in the night sky you're
actually<00:00:23.160> seeing<00:00:23.490> reflected<00:00:24.029> sunlight<00:00:24.269> and

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
actually seeing reflected sunlight and

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.480 
actually seeing reflected sunlight and
tonight<00:00:25.320> everything<00:00:25.830> is<00:00:25.920> going<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.070> be<00:00:26.160> lined

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
tonight everything is going to be lined

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.490 
tonight everything is going to be lined
up<00:00:26.670> perfectly<00:00:27.210> so<00:00:27.840> that<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.080> moon<00:00:28.230> is<00:00:28.260> gonna

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
up perfectly so that the moon is gonna

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.080 
up perfectly so that the moon is gonna
pass<00:00:28.769> through<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.130> shadow<00:00:29.369> of<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.640> earth<00:00:29.670> and

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
pass through the shadow of the earth and

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.939 
pass through the shadow of the earth and
that<00:00:30.150> will<00:00:30.300> block<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.779> sunlight<00:00:30.990> so<00:00:31.679> what<00:00:31.830> you

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
that will block the sunlight so what you

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.220 
that will block the sunlight so what you
will<00:00:32.099> see<00:00:32.340> is<00:00:32.700> this<00:00:32.969> curved<00:00:33.390> shadow<00:00:33.780> moving

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
will see is this curved shadow moving

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.440 
will see is this curved shadow moving
across<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:35.040> full<00:00:35.219> moon<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.730> during<00:00:36.360> the

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
across the full moon and during the

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.030 
across the full moon and during the
deepest<00:00:36.930> part<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.290> eclipse<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.800> moon

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
deepest part of the eclipse the moon

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.889 
deepest part of the eclipse the moon
will<00:00:38.160> actually<00:00:38.489> look<00:00:38.640> red<00:00:39.030> it's<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.390> beautiful

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
will actually look red it's a beautiful

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.049 
will actually look red it's a beautiful
thing<00:00:39.930> now<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.890> reason<00:00:41.129> that<00:00:41.309> happens<00:00:41.850> that

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
thing now the reason that happens that

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.150 
thing now the reason that happens that
the<00:00:42.149> only<00:00:42.329> sunlight<00:00:42.899> reaching<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.649> moon<00:00:43.829> is

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
the only sunlight reaching the moon is

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.950 
the only sunlight reaching the moon is
light<00:00:44.760> that's<00:00:44.910> being<00:00:45.000> scattered<00:00:45.690> through<00:00:45.930> the

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
light that's being scattered through the

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.930 
light that's being scattered through the
atmosphere<00:00:46.200> of<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.710> earth<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.280> Earth's

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
atmosphere of the earth and the Earth's

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.389 
atmosphere of the earth and the Earth's
atmosphere<00:00:48.239> scatters<00:00:48.930> away<00:00:49.320> blue<00:00:49.590> light<00:00:49.829> but

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
atmosphere scatters away blue light but

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.830 
atmosphere scatters away blue light but
let's<00:00:50.579> read<00:00:50.850> light<00:00:51.059> through<00:00:51.329> in<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.510> much<00:00:51.629> more

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
let's read light through in a much more

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.600 
let's read light through in a much more
direct<00:00:52.020> manner<00:00:52.440> it's<00:00:53.010> actually<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.460> reason

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
direct manner it's actually the reason

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.700 
direct manner it's actually the reason
the<00:00:53.879> sunrise<00:00:54.300> or<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.570> sunset<00:00:54.629> looks<00:00:55.079> red<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.379> us

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
the sunrise or a sunset looks red to us

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.200 
the sunrise or a sunset looks red to us
that<00:00:56.190> red<00:00:56.460> light<00:00:56.699> is<00:00:56.850> bouncing<00:00:57.300> off<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.449> moon

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
that red light is bouncing off the moon

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.029 
that red light is bouncing off the moon
so<00:01:00.210> what<00:01:00.449> do<00:01:00.629> we<00:01:00.690> need<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.140> do<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.710> see<00:01:01.920> this

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
so what do we need to do to see this

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.429 
so what do we need to do to see this
eclipse<00:01:02.489> tomorrow<00:01:02.780> we<00:01:03.780> know<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.049> wonderful

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
eclipse tomorrow we know the wonderful

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.660 
eclipse tomorrow we know the wonderful
thing<00:01:04.559> about<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.769> lunar<00:01:05.040> eclipse<00:01:05.070> is<00:01:05.519> you<00:01:05.580> don't

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
thing about a lunar eclipse is you don't

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.070 
thing about a lunar eclipse is you don't
need<00:01:05.850> anything<00:01:06.119> special<00:01:06.510> you<00:01:06.780> don't<00:01:06.930> need<00:01:06.990> a

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
need anything special you don't need a

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.350 
need anything special you don't need a
telescope<00:01:07.409> or<00:01:07.830> Eclipse<00:01:08.130> glasses<00:01:08.220> just<00:01:09.119> go

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
telescope or Eclipse glasses just go

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.510 
telescope or Eclipse glasses just go
outside<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.930> find<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.409> full<00:01:10.590> moon<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.070> if

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
outside and find the full moon and if

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.859 
outside and find the full moon and if
you're<00:01:11.670> on<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.850> East<00:01:12.119> Coast<00:01:12.270> it'll<00:01:12.750> begin

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
you're on the East Coast it'll begin

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.480 
you're on the East Coast it'll begin
around<00:01:13.170> two<00:01:13.470> a.m.<00:01:13.799> you'll<00:01:14.010> see<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.250> shadow

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
around two a.m. you'll see the shadow

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.700 
around two a.m. you'll see the shadow
pass<00:01:14.790> across<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.659> moon<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:15.990> then<00:01:16.590> the

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
pass across the moon and then the

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.740 
pass across the moon and then the
deepest<00:01:17.159> reddest<00:01:17.549> part<00:01:17.790> will<00:01:17.909> be<00:01:17.939> about<00:01:18.150> 3<00:01:18.420> 45

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
deepest reddest part will be about 3 45

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
spacecraft around the moon use solar

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.719 
spacecraft around the moon use solar
batteries<00:01:34.619> they<00:01:34.799> need<00:01:34.920> solar<00:01:35.189> panels<00:01:35.579> in

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
batteries they need solar panels in

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.940 
batteries they need solar panels in
sunlight<00:01:36.090> so<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:37.020> eclipse<00:01:37.320> will<00:01:37.409> block<00:01:37.650> the

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
sunlight so the eclipse will block the

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.530 
sunlight so the eclipse will block the
sunlight<00:01:38.189> meaning<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.790> batteries<00:01:39.180> will<00:01:39.360> run

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
sunlight meaning the batteries will run

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.510 
sunlight meaning the batteries will run

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
things we're learning about the moon

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.539 
things we're learning about the moon
from<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.259> spacecraft's<00:01:59.009> that<00:01:59.130> are<00:01:59.250> orbiting

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
from the spacecraft's that are orbiting

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.300 
from the spacecraft's that are orbiting
it<00:01:59.990> well<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.079> moon<00:02:01.229> seems<00:02:01.469> so<00:02:01.649> familiar<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:02.280> us

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
it well the moon seems so familiar to us

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.980 
it well the moon seems so familiar to us
but<00:02:02.670> it<00:02:02.729> turns<00:02:02.939> out<00:02:03.030> there's<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.299> lot<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:03.750> learn

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
but it turns out there's a lot to learn

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.130 
but it turns out there's a lot to learn
about<00:02:04.020> its<00:02:04.500> past<00:02:04.799> its<00:02:05.189> evolution<00:02:05.700> over<00:02:05.939> time

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140
