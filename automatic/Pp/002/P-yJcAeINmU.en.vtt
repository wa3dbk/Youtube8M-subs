00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:06.500
 cristian could stay in bonn 2 ended 

00:00:04.189 --> 00:00:08.180
 the high school gave the exams of 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.369
 entry to higher education and 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.260
 he started his university studies 

00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:14.359
 10 years have passed since Christian 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.699
 finished high school is about to 

00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:18.769
 get reacquainted with your ex-partners in the 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:21.560
 first meeting since that moment in 

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:24.699
 your old school I do not feel like much 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.699
 of seeing all 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:33.150
 and I think some teachers will attend 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.570
 you will also surely recognize me it is not very 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.570
 hard 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.989
 but I do not know if I would recognize all 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.989
 I will look for two strong boys so that 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.590
 help us, I'm very happy to see you 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:57.840
 these 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.860
 as always 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.860
 paula sra 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.829
 Hi how are you 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.840
 I remember that you loved children 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:31.150
 bet so I brought you a little 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:35.190
 gift I hope you thank you 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.190
 we offer for all of us 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.510
 for the next meeting in ten more years 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.580
 Later comes the best friend of 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.710
 christian in school always sat 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.420
 next to him in class to come the 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.650
 director of the cristian school was a 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.650
 boy like any other 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.900
 to sit next to him he had many 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.900
 Benefits 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:05.010
 he was very good student 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:07.670
 blas let him copy his homework and was 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.670
 I appreciated it very much 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:14.050
 and he also left to spy on 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:17.520
 answers from your computer that we had 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.520
 I saw the head so that it would rain 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:25.340
 kabul 6 Sep did not want special treatment 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.230
 look at what we sign up for in the class 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.750
 art I know 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:34.209
 of course the results that 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:36.709
 achieved with his prostheses were limited 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:40.400
 but it was just a matter of having that in 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:44.000
 account some teachers decided not to 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.040
 evaluate it but outside of that applied 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.799
 the same standards for him as for 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.019
 any other child the students had 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:55.780
 very clear that cristian was not a case 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:55.780
 special and that here they did not give him advantages 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:02.579
 It was not a special case but it left a 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:02.579
 footprint that lasts until today 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:12.350
 each one and I worry about him never 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:15.520
 he knows how he will respond to his body because 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:18.940
 to his disability but I know his mind 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.940
 It works very well 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.040
 his former classmates and teachers meet 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.569
 for lunch in a hotel many 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.730
 things changed in the 10 years that 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:33.099
 happened since he left high school and 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.110
 There are many novelties to tell but 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:38.730
 there are things that never change the 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.730
 companionship and trust 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:48.190
 we had to take him everywhere 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:51.940
 I had to trust that I could help him 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:55.620
 it was not a normal situation 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:59.300
 one day I entered the class and there I was 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:03.100
 and I had never seen it before 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.100
 it's not easy to forget something like that 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:13.180
 at the same time with a war wounded 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.950
 it transpired without control 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.220
 we throw our hands work like a 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:20.769
 external thermostat 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:23.970
 but since I do not have hands, my body does not 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.970
 regulates the temperature well 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.849
 that's why cristian must change 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.069
 of clothes every two or three hours 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:33.139
 his teammates felt good for being able to 

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:35.839
 help him with this task while he was 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:38.319
 at school even though what 

00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:40.819
 we considered as someone special 

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:43.069
 when you meet people like 

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:45.740
 he learns to treat people from 

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:47.929
 another way a person can have a 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.080
 disability but it's still a 

00:04:47.929 --> 00:04:50.080
 person 

00:04:50.929 --> 00:04:57.319
 we had a lot of fun with him he could not 

00:04:55.279 --> 00:05:01.419
 gestures but it was very good with the 

00:04:57.319 --> 00:05:01.419
 words and it made us laugh a lot 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.970
 it's been 10 years since christian saw 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.930
 to his classmates for the last time but it's 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.930
 as if it had been yesterday 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:19.480
 goodbye christian see you in 5 years such 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:19.480
 time without god nobody very well 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:25.240
 goodbye, goodbye, health to your mother from me 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:29.169
 Clear 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:32.230
 I hoped they could get out of their way 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:37.419
 johnny studying at the university 

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:37.419
 now here is more and he succeeded 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:44.639
 struggle to be who wants to be in this 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:44.639
 situation 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.860
 He has been god since 2002
