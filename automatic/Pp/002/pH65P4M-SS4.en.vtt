development<00:00:48.370> is<00:00:48.460> on<00:00:48.640> schedule<00:00:48.940> we<00:00:49.480> have<00:00:49.810> an

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
development is on schedule we have an

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.050 
development is on schedule we have an
initial<00:00:50.410> system<00:00:50.740> in<00:00:50.980> place<00:00:51.130> for<00:00:51.430> testing<00:00:51.880> and

initial system in place for testing and

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.090 
initial system in place for testing and
we're<00:00:52.750> really<00:00:52.960> pleased<00:00:53.380> with<00:00:53.530> the<00:00:53.710> results

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
we're really pleased with the results

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.310 
we're really pleased with the results
were<00:00:54.190> seen<00:00:54.430> so<00:00:54.700> far<00:00:54.940> we'll<00:00:55.750> start<00:00:55.930> posting

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
were seen so far we'll start posting

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:02.830 
were seen so far we'll start posting
some<00:00:56.560> pictures<00:00:56.890> soon

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.240 

well<00:01:03.840> we're<00:01:03.990> aiming<00:01:04.110> for<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.470> process<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:04.920> be

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
well we're aiming for the process to be

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.430 
well we're aiming for the process to be
of<00:01:05.489> course<00:01:05.760> as<00:01:06.000> automatic<00:01:06.540> as<00:01:06.660> possible<00:01:07.260> it

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.440 
of course as automatic as possible it

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.360 
of course as automatic as possible it
might<00:01:08.130> be<00:01:08.400> that<00:01:08.430> we<00:01:08.850> add<00:01:09.120> the<00:01:09.360> ability<00:01:09.450> for

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:10.370 
might be that we add the ability for

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.920 
might be that we add the ability for
selecting<00:01:11.370> key<00:01:11.550> features<00:01:11.970> on<00:01:12.180> scans<00:01:12.540> to

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
selecting key features on scans to

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.810 
selecting key features on scans to
provide<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.410> kind<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:13.860> early<00:01:14.070> registration

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
provide a kind of early registration

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.450 
provide a kind of early registration
process<00:01:15.479> before<00:01:15.690> stitching<00:01:16.140> but<00:01:16.500> no<00:01:17.280> matter

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
process before stitching but no matter

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.969 
process before stitching but no matter
what<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.570> user<00:01:18.780> will<00:01:19.020> never<00:01:19.320> have<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.620> handle

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
what the user will never have to handle

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:26.840 
what the user will never have to handle
on<00:01:20.160> the<00:01:20.280> skin

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.420 

yes<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:27.630> will<00:01:27.840> need<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.350> crop<00:01:28.740> your<00:01:28.799> scans<00:01:29.250> and

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
yes you will need to crop your scans and

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.399 
yes you will need to crop your scans and
feel<00:01:29.610> 3d<00:01:30.060> before<00:01:30.600> bringing<00:01:30.780> them<00:01:30.990> into<00:01:31.140> mesh

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
feel 3d before bringing them into mesh

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.280 
feel 3d before bringing them into mesh
up<00:01:31.650> but<00:01:32.340> both<00:01:32.640> you<00:01:32.790> formula<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.420> feel<00:01:33.689> 3d<00:01:34.110> are

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
up but both you formula and feel 3d are

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.469 
up but both you formula and feel 3d are
interested<00:01:35.100> in<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.520> tighter<00:01:35.790> integration<00:01:36.000> in

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
interested in a tighter integration in

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:42.719 
interested in a tighter integration in
the<00:01:36.570> near<00:01:36.750> future

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:45.760 

well<00:01:43.729> there<00:01:44.119> are<00:01:44.149> a<00:01:44.630> couple<00:01:45.200> of<00:01:45.409> answers<00:01:45.560> to

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
well there are a couple of answers to

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.179 
well there are a couple of answers to
this<00:01:46.009> question<00:01:46.070> the<00:01:46.850> most<00:01:47.090> obvious<00:01:47.329> is<00:01:47.810> yes<00:01:48.799> we

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
this question the most obvious is yes we

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:51.399 
this question the most obvious is yes we
certainly<00:01:49.520> want<00:01:50.000> the<00:01:50.329> stitching<00:01:50.810> process<00:01:50.960> to

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
certainly want the stitching process to

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:53.889 
certainly want the stitching process to
be<00:01:51.530> as<00:01:51.679> seamless<00:01:51.920> as<00:01:52.130> possible<00:01:52.780> but<00:01:53.780> it's

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
be as seamless as possible but it's

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:56.289 
be as seamless as possible but it's
going<00:01:54.109> to<00:01:54.229> greatly<00:01:54.439> depend<00:01:54.920> on<00:01:55.189> the<00:01:56.090> few

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
going to greatly depend on the few

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:58.870 
going to greatly depend on the few
factors<00:01:56.719> the<00:01:56.929> quality<00:01:57.319> of<00:01:57.350> the<00:01:57.500> scan<00:01:57.880> the

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
factors the quality of the scan the

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.359 
factors the quality of the scan the
cropping<00:01:59.329> of<00:01:59.780> the<00:01:59.929> skins<00:02:00.229> and<00:02:00.619> then<00:02:01.069> the

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
cropping of the skins and then the

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:04.120 
cropping of the skins and then the
overlap<00:02:01.909> between<00:02:02.209> the<00:02:02.990> scans<00:02:03.259> so<00:02:03.770> right<00:02:04.100> now

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
overlap between the scans so right now

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.130 
overlap between the scans so right now
our<00:02:04.310> tests<00:02:04.880> are<00:02:04.939> revealing<00:02:05.299> that<00:02:05.569> you're

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
our tests are revealing that you're

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.240 
our tests are revealing that you're
going<00:02:06.289> to<00:02:06.380> want<00:02:06.469> to<00:02:06.590> have<00:02:06.679> somewhere<00:02:07.069> between

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
going to want to have somewhere between

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.389 
going to want to have somewhere between
a<00:02:07.429> forty<00:02:07.819> and<00:02:07.880> sixty<00:02:08.090> percent<00:02:08.450> overlap<00:02:09.399> now

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
a forty and sixty percent overlap now

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.330 
a forty and sixty percent overlap now
the<00:02:10.729> second<00:02:11.090> answer<00:02:11.239> to<00:02:11.540> that<00:02:11.690> is<00:02:12.140> seamless<00:02:13.010> in

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
the second answer to that is seamless in

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.550 
the second answer to that is seamless in

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
file size is of course it can't give an

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.610 
file size is of course it can't give an
exact<00:02:35.220> size<00:02:35.460> but<00:02:36.180> what<00:02:36.300> I<00:02:36.330> can<00:02:36.600> say<00:02:36.630> is<00:02:36.870> the

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
exact size but what I can say is the

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.860 
exact size but what I can say is the
data<00:02:37.860> that<00:02:38.070> comes<00:02:38.310> in<00:02:38.580> to<00:02:39.270> mesh<00:02:39.480> out<00:02:39.660> for

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
data that comes in to mesh out for

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.020 
data that comes in to mesh out for
stitching<00:02:40.260> what<00:02:40.800> we<00:02:40.920> output<00:02:41.430> will<00:02:41.700> course

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
stitching what we output will course

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.850 
stitching what we output will course
only<00:02:42.240> be<00:02:42.450> smaller<00:02:42.780> because<00:02:43.140> wherever<00:02:43.530> there's

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
only be smaller because wherever there's

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.250 
only be smaller because wherever there's
an<00:02:44.130> overlap<00:02:44.610> will<00:02:45.240> combine<00:02:45.600> that<00:02:45.840> so<00:02:46.110> the

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
an overlap will combine that so the

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:54.059 
an overlap will combine that so the
resulting<00:02:46.740> mesh<00:02:46.920> will<00:02:47.070> be<00:02:47.190> smaller

industrial tool of course the whole idea

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:01.800 
industrial tool of course the whole idea
behind<00:03:00.129> my<00:03:00.400> ship<00:03:00.609> is<00:03:00.790> it's<00:03:01.060> an<00:03:01.209> easy-to-use

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
behind my ship is it's an easy-to-use

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.959 
behind my ship is it's an easy-to-use
tool<00:03:02.200> to<00:03:02.560> bring<00:03:02.709> in<00:03:02.920> multiple<00:03:03.340> messages<00:03:03.730> make

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:03.969 
tool to bring in multiple messages make

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:06.030 
tool to bring in multiple messages make
something<00:03:04.359> new<00:03:04.569> and<00:03:04.900> export<00:03:05.590> it<00:03:05.620> for<00:03:05.799> 3d

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
something new and export it for 3d

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.449 
something new and export it for 3d
printing<00:03:06.359> so<00:03:07.359> feel<00:03:07.749> 3d<00:03:08.139> and<00:03:08.379> mesh<00:03:09.040> up<00:03:09.280> are

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
printing so feel 3d and mesh up are

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.970 
printing so feel 3d and mesh up are
really<00:03:10.150> good<00:03:10.299> at<00:03:10.450> organic<00:03:10.989> objects<00:03:11.680> were

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
really good at organic objects were

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.979 
really good at organic objects were
really<00:03:12.280> good<00:03:12.459> at<00:03:12.639> our<00:03:12.670> artistic<00:03:13.209> objects<00:03:13.780> like

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
really good at our artistic objects like

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:15.990 
really good at our artistic objects like
scanning<00:03:14.349> the<00:03:14.560> face<00:03:14.769> putting<00:03:15.549> it<00:03:15.639> on<00:03:15.790> an

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
scanning the face putting it on an

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.330 
scanning the face putting it on an
object<00:03:16.150> and<00:03:16.959> exporting<00:03:17.739> that<00:03:17.829> out<00:03:17.950> for<00:03:18.099> 3d

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
object and exporting that out for 3d

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.979 
object and exporting that out for 3d
printing<00:03:18.400> so<00:03:18.939> we're<00:03:19.269> really<00:03:19.450> good<00:03:19.689> at<00:03:19.719> that

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
printing so we're really good at that

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.440 
printing so we're really good at that
you<00:03:20.889> know<00:03:21.430> having<00:03:21.700> said<00:03:21.879> that<00:03:21.909> you<00:03:22.299> can

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
you know having said that you can

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.929 
you know having said that you can
certainly<00:03:22.629> take<00:03:23.019> an<00:03:23.200> object<00:03:23.560> that<00:03:23.620> you<00:03:24.310> make

00:03:24.929 --> 00:03:24.939 
certainly take an object that you make

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:26.909 
certainly take an object that you make
in<00:03:25.209> mesh<00:03:25.450> up<00:03:25.629> and<00:03:25.780> export<00:03:26.230> it<00:03:26.319> and<00:03:26.469> bring<00:03:26.889> it

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:26.919 
in mesh up and export it and bring it

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:30.329 
in mesh up and export it and bring it
back<00:03:27.040> into<00:03:27.370> a<00:03:27.549> CAD<00:03:28.090> CAM<00:03:28.299> software
