little hope and then we're obviously
need<00:02:59.550> to<00:02:59.700> go<00:02:59.850> into<00:03:00.060> the<00:03:00.270> user<00:03:00.450> research<00:03:00.930> lab

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
need to go into the user research lab

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.400 
need to go into the user research lab
and<00:03:01.530> we're<00:03:01.920> going<00:03:02.040> to<00:03:02.070> place<00:03:02.280> and<00:03:02.490> taken<00:03:02.760> king

so<00:03:07.410> we've<00:03:08.190> been<00:03:08.370> in<00:03:08.460> space<00:03:08.850> since<00:03:09.540> about<00:03:10.080> 2010

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
so we've been in space since about 2010

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.470 
so we've been in space since about 2010
prior<00:03:12.060> to<00:03:12.090> that<00:03:12.300> it<00:03:12.720> was<00:03:13.020> a<00:03:13.050> bowling<00:03:13.740> alley<00:03:13.860> and
