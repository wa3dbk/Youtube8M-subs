00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
first part of the level it takes you

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.039 
first part of the level it takes you
back<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.060> very<00:01:24.149> first<00:01:24.450> part<00:01:24.689> of<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.840> world

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.319 
princess for that level just for some
reason<00:02:07.770> I<00:02:07.890> think<00:02:08.250> she<00:02:08.489> was<00:02:08.670> probably<00:02:08.820> the<00:02:09.149> best

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:09.329 
reason I think she was probably the best

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:11.180 
reason I think she was probably the best
for<00:02:09.509> that<00:02:09.600> level<00:02:09.899> I<00:02:10.079> think<00:02:10.259> my<00:02:10.560> favorite<00:02:10.950> world

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
for that level I think my favorite world

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.970 
for that level I think my favorite world
would<00:02:11.430> be<00:02:11.579> the<00:02:11.640> cloud<00:02:12.000> one<00:02:12.359> because<00:02:13.230> it<00:02:13.560> godson

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
would be the cloud one because it godson

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.190 
would be the cloud one because it godson
it<00:02:14.220> has<00:02:14.430> an<00:02:14.609> interesting<00:02:14.940> level<00:02:15.480> design<00:02:15.750> the

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
it has an interesting level design the

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.050 
it has an interesting level design the
one<00:02:16.410> really<00:02:16.859> unique<00:02:17.070> thing<00:02:17.459> about<00:02:17.489> this<00:02:17.820> game

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
one really unique thing about this game

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.310 
one really unique thing about this game
is<00:02:18.209> that<00:02:18.239> each<00:02:18.510> one<00:02:18.660> of<00:02:18.780> these<00:02:18.840> levels<00:02:19.049> could

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
is that each one of these levels could

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.660 
is that each one of these levels could
be<00:02:19.380> played<00:02:19.650> with<00:02:19.799> four<00:02:20.040> different<00:02:20.340> kinds<00:02:20.579> of

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
with a little review is that Berto was

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.540 
with a little review is that Berto was
way<00:05:10.110> over<00:05:10.410> years<00:05:10.680> what<00:05:11.039> I<00:05:11.099> liked<00:05:11.280> about<00:05:11.340> this

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
way over years what I liked about this

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.310 
way over years what I liked about this
game<00:05:11.789> was<00:05:12.030> the<00:05:12.210> level<00:05:12.509> designs<00:05:12.840> and<00:05:13.110> the

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
game was the level designs and the

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.960 
game was the level designs and the
characters<00:05:13.860> that<00:05:14.070> you<00:05:14.130> could<00:05:14.430> change<00:05:14.669> out

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
characters that you could change out

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.730 
characters that you could change out
because<00:05:15.449> if<00:05:15.630> one<00:05:15.810> character<00:05:16.199> is<00:05:16.259> not<00:05:16.380> working

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
because if one character is not working

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.439 
because if one character is not working
in<00:05:16.830> a<00:05:16.889> level<00:05:17.220> you<00:05:17.490> just<00:05:17.520> change<00:05:17.970> it<00:05:18.060> out<00:05:18.240> and

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:18.449 
in a level you just change it out and

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:19.879 
in a level you just change it out and
try<00:05:18.720> a<00:05:18.750> new<00:05:18.840> one<00:05:19.169> but<00:05:19.410> I<00:05:19.470> didn't<00:05:19.680> like<00:05:19.770> about

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
the controls were just a little bit

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.870 
the controls were just a little bit
slippery<00:05:25.440> on<00:05:25.650> all<00:05:25.830> the<00:05:25.979> characters<00:05:26.430> Super

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180 
download for the Virtual Console I think

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:52.850 
download for the Virtual Console I think
Mario<00:05:51.360> all-stars<00:05:51.630> is<00:05:51.930> worth<00:05:52.110> of<00:05:52.260> rent<00:05:52.470> and<00:05:52.710> if

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 
Mario all-stars is worth of rent and if

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.379 
Mario all-stars is worth of rent and if
it<00:05:52.949> ever<00:05:53.039> comes<00:05:53.310> down<00:05:53.370> to<00:05:53.580> like<00:05:53.729> a<00:05:53.760> reasonable

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:54.389 
it ever comes down to like a reasonable

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:56.360 
it ever comes down to like a reasonable
price<00:05:54.570> of<00:05:54.840> fifteen<00:05:55.199> to<00:05:55.229> twenty<00:05:55.590> dollars<00:05:55.710> then

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
price of fifteen to twenty dollars then

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:02.460 
price of fifteen to twenty dollars then
I<00:05:56.400> think<00:05:56.669> it's<00:05:56.820> absolutely<00:05:57.240> worth<00:05:57.389> it<00:05:57.479> by<00:05:57.659> then

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:02.470 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:04.530
