00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:10.210
 hi then lucio 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:11.710
 today we do an exhibition because everyone 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.560
 you ask me to do controlled 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:16.860
 salt them let's make a quick plate e 

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:19.350
 fast 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:22.040
 the sounds that remember the summer between 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.040
 sicily 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:30.110
 the whole life the sea will show you 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:31.710
 the first ingredient ingredients 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.960
 spring onion 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.550
 I found a map to this increasingly 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.760
 wine is using the lines 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.960
 start 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:43.600
 however, we always have tomatoes 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:50.559
 last pistachio olives 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:55.930
 france and parsley to finish and tell a 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:57.530
 me the shrimps so the water already is 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.480
 boiling 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.700
 assuming the linguines are ready for 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.470
 be plunge into boiling water 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:08.460
 we immediately begin to prepare ours 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:12.710
 convinced or the heat goes of the house one 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.710
 leon shirt computer to the sky 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:20.910
 why 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:23.760
 as disagreement everything is lost a little 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:26.340
 more but we know that to dario for the 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.730
 super spicy and let's flavor 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.230
 all our oil while 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.480
 s'incaponisce well then the garlic and 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.670
 we remove in a little bit 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.470
 when we enter purified we take it 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.050
 from the oil however this recipe is 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.550
 very easy and fast 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:44.040
 everyone can do it anywhere 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.860
 of the world you are understood giorgia but when 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:50.430
 the oil is hot like now that you are 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:56.490
 flavoring we also throw the 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:02:02.010
 spring onion and we do it a fund of 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:06.570
 to finally say that there are 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:10.560
 prepare a spring onion to put on 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:14.370
 decoration over the spring onion is very 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.530
 good because it tastes the same as 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.230
 onion but much more delicate so not 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.560
 dish like this where there is no fish 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:25.920
 goes to undermine ours too 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.590
 our taste many use it a lot 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.220
 but I also find in the suffered go 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.989
 very well I would say to throw the pasta 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.580
 in large salted water 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.820
 I was very hungry so we're going to do 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:41.520
 like half a kilo of pasta and throw away the 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:44.880
 pasta takes nine minutes mandate 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:50.250
 this we raise the fire we take 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:52.200
 we put our prawns on it 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.110
 because these have a cooking time 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.050
 longer than the shrimp then 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.650
 let's start at that time 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:02.750
 the legs follow from gray and altan e 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.270
 reds once they are red we know 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.380
 that we are strong 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:09.370
 you have to be careful with cooking 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:15.290
 shrimp because it once went over 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:20.060
 they are hard of whom they are all chewing 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:22.030
 they are just the super good ones they become 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.630
 goal what can eat me 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:28.790
 when we withdraw them we insert the others 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:31.820
 Shrimp inserted into the other shrimp 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.410
 We would insert after the tomato that so 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:36.440
 somewhat softens but does not 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.630
 we cook our firsts completely 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.520
 then we finish the dish because this 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.890
 that they will be ready and in ten minutes 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:46.280
 you did a super farce and you legs 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:49.460
 they also find frozen foods and have food 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.470
 costs quite good though if it is 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:56.600
 take the shrimp in itself ta ... 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:58.550
 But as a little every now and then is fine you 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.000
 he is removing his face with water 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:02.120
 hot 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.350
 now that we've turned it over there 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.350
 we also touch these 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:12.790
 this recipe is looked crazy at 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.250
 supermarket because I stopped in front 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.739
 to the runners in front of things staring 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.980
 the toilet makes me because I was going to the fact 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:23.340
 made me think a lot about comics 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:28.690
 Catalan shrimp that I ate 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:32.100
 the old lampare in Sardinia a 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:35.669
 more reason to make this pasta 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:41.229
 the only thing you need to do is buy 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:45.850
 unsalted pistachios that are not roasted then 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:53.400
 bridge special gel did not mince of 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:55.060
 such almost the territory so much so 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.860
 maybe we care 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.570
 while we pass these aside 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.930
 shrimp so that we will then use them as 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:04.780
 decoration right now 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:13.720
 add the tomatoes that come to us 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:16.930
 bit of liquid and the sauce is not not done 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:19.870
 there is nothing else to do all this 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:23.050
 this was not this marate 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:26.289
 all the flavors of our shrimp 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:28.479
 tomato will serve us to whisk the 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:31.210
 pasta, drain it a minute back 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:33.910
 so that we can go over the most 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.850
 our sauce without any problem 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:40.870
 kind 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:45.640
 can we here this here that the 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:48.510
 olives and immediately escaped 

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.510
 let's focus 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:55.120
 add a drop of oil begin to 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:06:01.210
 insert only a handful of 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:04.480
 we need pistachios 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:06.610
 simply my shoulder to implant 

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.860
 we help each other, I help myself with pliers if 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.610
 you have the fork the spaghetti goes 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:13.510
 more than good 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:16.390
 if you have a pastry cutter to be 

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:18.210
 precise in arranging the pasta or even 

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:20.830
 better it will seem even more orderly 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:25.210
 so we take some of our own 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:30.000
 seasoning if it does not appear on the plate 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:40.900
 perfectly accurate is fine 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:44.410
 ok for children the grating of one 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:46.450
 orange peel then if you don't mind 

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:48.600
 there was no intel and two leaflets of 

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:48.600
 parsley 

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:52.260
 how many I think 

00:06:53.590 --> 00:07:01.570
 who are not up are rebelling 

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:09.020
 stay up the king of the evening 

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:16.840
 the shrimp but can't the handful of 

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:24.350
 grains of pistachios still to finish 

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:27.770
 raw onion here I am 

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:31.040
 I would call pasta incontro sicilia 

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:34.790
 sardinia london because we have the orange 

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:36.680
 the shrimp pistachio reminds from the 

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:39.280
 rooms the guitar as well as the flavors 

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.280
 of Sicily 

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:49.360
 this is our purest pasta 

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:49.360
 let me know how bye
