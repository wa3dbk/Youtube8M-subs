00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
secret test it appears to me also just

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.410 
secret test it appears to me also just
looking<00:01:05.770> at<00:01:05.950> what<00:01:06.219> Howard<00:01:06.850> said<00:01:07.119> that<00:01:07.299> he's

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
looking at what Howard said that he's

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.499 
looking at what Howard said that he's
pretty<00:01:07.990> much<00:01:08.530> into<00:01:09.100> Pirelli<00:01:09.490> as<00:01:09.670> well<00:01:09.939> having

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:10.509 
pretty much into Pirelli as well having

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:13.469 
pretty much into Pirelli as well having
not<00:01:11.130> let<00:01:12.130> the<00:01:12.280> other<00:01:12.429> teams<00:01:12.759> know<00:01:13.090> that<00:01:13.359> the

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
not let the other teams know that the

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:15.779 
not let the other teams know that the
test<00:01:13.689> test<00:01:14.020> was<00:01:14.170> taking<00:01:14.469> place<00:01:14.649> and<00:01:15.100> he<00:01:15.369> seems

00:01:15.779 --> 00:01:15.789 
test test was taking place and he seems

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:17.789 
test test was taking place and he seems
to<00:01:16.209> be<00:01:16.240> opening<00:01:16.840> the<00:01:16.990> door<00:01:17.170> I<00:01:17.200> think<00:01:17.560> to

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:17.799 
to be opening the door I think to

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:21.029 
to be opening the door I think to
Pirelli<00:01:18.450> being<00:01:19.450> involved<00:01:19.990> under<00:01:20.649> the<00:01:20.770> heading

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:21.039 
Pirelli being involved under the heading

motorsport generally and I to me that

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:36.179 
motorsport generally and I to me that
smells<00:01:34.840> like<00:01:34.929> the<00:01:35.139> FIA<00:01:35.409> opening<00:01:35.950> the<00:01:36.039> door

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:36.189 
smells like the FIA opening the door

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:38.699 
smells like the FIA opening the door
wide<00:01:36.429> open<00:01:36.459> for<00:01:37.049> Pirelli<00:01:38.049> to<00:01:38.259> be<00:01:38.380> brought<00:01:38.560> into

wide open for Pirelli to be brought into

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:41.580 
wide open for Pirelli to be brought into
the<00:01:38.859> breach<00:01:39.039> as<00:01:39.219> well<00:01:39.689> yeah<00:01:40.689> absolutely<00:01:41.109> and

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
the breach as well yeah absolutely and

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:42.779 
the breach as well yeah absolutely and
it's<00:01:42.159> interesting<00:01:42.340> that<00:01:42.490> Pirelli

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:42.789 
it's interesting that Pirelli

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:44.730 
it's interesting that Pirelli
immediately<00:01:43.450> tried<00:01:43.689> to<00:01:43.810> Pat<00:01:43.990> that<00:01:44.170> back<00:01:44.409> by

immediately tried to Pat that back by

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.069 
immediately tried to Pat that back by

told to do we came along we're abided by
Pirelli<00:03:27.670> and<00:03:28.090> you<00:03:28.840> could<00:03:28.989> argue<00:03:29.140> yeah<00:03:29.709> it's<00:03:30.280> a

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
Pirelli and you could argue yeah it's a

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.160 
Pirelli and you could argue yeah it's a
fairly<00:03:30.579> straightforward<00:03:31.209> argument<00:03:31.600> equally

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
fairly straightforward argument equally

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.050 
fairly straightforward argument equally
probably<00:03:33.040> won't<00:03:33.190> be<00:03:33.280> very<00:03:33.400> happy<00:03:33.640> about<00:03:33.790> that

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
probably won't be very happy about that

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.870 
probably won't be very happy about that
I<00:03:34.799> think<00:03:35.799> the<00:03:35.890> word<00:03:36.069> that<00:03:36.220> springs<00:03:36.280> to<00:03:36.489> mind<00:03:36.609> at

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
I think the word that springs to mind at

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.190 
I think the word that springs to mind at
all<00:03:36.970> of<00:03:37.120> these<00:03:37.239> arguments<00:03:37.540> is<00:03:37.780> disingenuous

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
all of these arguments is disingenuous

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.340 
all of these arguments is disingenuous
isn't<00:03:38.890> it<00:03:38.950> because<00:03:39.510> when<00:03:40.510> /<00:03:40.660> ally<00:03:40.780> have<00:03:41.170> been<00:03:41.319> a

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
isn't it because when / ally have been a

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.490 
isn't it because when / ally have been a
difficult<00:03:41.709> situation<00:03:42.160> tires<00:03:43.060> all<00:03:43.750> season<00:03:44.290> and

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
difficult situation tires all season and

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.680 
difficult situation tires all season and
obviously<00:03:45.100> then<00:03:45.280> they<00:03:45.970> clearly<00:03:46.299> wanted
