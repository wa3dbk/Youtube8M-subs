alright<00:01:01.510> take<00:01:01.809> a<00:01:01.839> look<00:01:02.019> at<00:01:02.110> this<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:03.399> exhaust

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
alright take a look at this the exhaust

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.289 
alright take a look at this the exhaust
runs<00:01:04.420> out<00:01:04.600> of<00:01:04.629> the<00:01:04.809> header<00:01:05.610> through<00:01:06.610> the<00:01:06.939> frame

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:07.299 
runs out of the header through the frame

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:10.320 
runs out of the header through the frame
and<00:01:07.830> under<00:01:08.830> the<00:01:08.920> car<00:01:09.159> now<00:01:09.640> if<00:01:09.820> you<00:01:09.970> look<00:01:10.210> at

and under the car now if you look at

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.480 
and under the car now if you look at
that<00:01:10.479> just<00:01:10.750> right<00:01:11.020> from<00:01:11.259> the<00:01:11.380> right<00:01:11.500> angle<00:01:11.740> you

that just right from the right angle you
will<00:01:12.640> see<00:01:12.880> that<00:01:13.000> modification<00:01:13.360> that<00:01:13.990> most<00:01:14.320> of

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
will see that modification that most of

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.740 
will see that modification that most of
the<00:01:14.619> time<00:01:14.860> especially<00:01:15.400> from<00:01:15.970> the<00:01:16.090> side<00:01:16.360> man

00:03:19.649 --> 00:03:19.659 
tuck up under the frame but as you can

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:21.839 
tuck up under the frame but as you can
see<00:03:19.719> we<00:03:20.379> have<00:03:20.620> got<00:03:20.829> a<00:03:21.040> clearance<00:03:21.370> issue<00:03:21.519> here

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:21.849

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:23.879 
see we have got a clearance issue here
with<00:03:21.969> the<00:03:22.030> frame<00:03:22.299> so<00:03:22.900> we're<00:03:23.530> gonna<00:03:23.620> have<00:03:23.799> to

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:23.889 
with the frame so we're gonna have to

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:25.619 
with the frame so we're gonna have to
notch<00:03:24.040> it<00:03:24.069> just<00:03:24.489> like<00:03:24.609> we<00:03:24.730> did<00:03:24.849> back<00:03:25.060> here<00:03:25.419> and

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:25.629 
notch it just like we did back here and

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:28.259 
notch it just like we did back here and
since<00:03:26.290> you<00:03:26.709> already<00:03:27.159> know<00:03:27.579> how<00:03:27.699> to<00:03:27.730> do<00:03:28.000> that

since you already know how to do that

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.179 
since you already know how to do that
it's<00:03:28.930> a<00:03:29.019> good<00:03:29.169> time<00:03:29.319> to<00:03:29.439> take<00:03:29.620> a<00:03:29.650> break<00:03:29.919> while<00:03:30.159> I

00:03:30.179 --> 00:03:30.189 
it's a good time to take a break while I

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:35.540 
it's a good time to take a break while I
finish<00:03:30.519> this<00:03:30.669> up

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
steps of putting this qtp exhaust cutout

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.690 
steps of putting this qtp exhaust cutout
on<00:03:54.660> our<00:03:55.230> headers<00:03:55.590> so<00:03:55.950> let's<00:03:56.130> take<00:03:56.280> a<00:03:56.310> look<00:03:56.550> how

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
on our headers so let's take a look how

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.930 
on our headers so let's take a look how
this<00:03:56.880> is<00:03:57.000> all<00:03:57.180> gonna<00:03:57.630> go<00:03:57.840> together<00:03:58.820> with<00:03:59.820> the

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
this is all gonna go together with the

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.270 
this is all gonna go together with the
frame<00:04:00.240> notched<00:04:00.570> the<00:04:01.170> cutout<00:04:01.500> just<00:04:01.800> bolts<00:04:02.130> up

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
frame notched the cutout just bolts up

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.040 
frame notched the cutout just bolts up
to<00:04:02.400> the<00:04:02.490> collector<00:04:02.940> followed<00:04:03.900> by<00:04:04.020> the<00:04:04.080> turnout

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.050 
to the collector followed by the turnout

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.930 
to the collector followed by the turnout
all<00:04:07.050> right<00:04:07.440> take<00:04:08.040> a<00:04:08.070> look<00:04:08.280> at<00:04:08.460> how<00:04:08.550> this<00:04:08.730> is

of it oh the real issue here is

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.980 
of it oh the real issue here is
functionality<00:04:25.830> so<00:04:26.400> how<00:04:27.030> does<00:04:27.180> it<00:04:27.270> work<00:04:27.450> well

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
functionality so how does it work well

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.500 
functionality so how does it work well
let's<00:04:28.170> take<00:04:28.320> a<00:04:28.350> look<00:04:28.560> with<00:04:29.190> it<00:04:29.310> closed<00:04:29.640> the
