00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.080
 hello everyone welcome to this new 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:07.240
 video this new world problem 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.250
 welcome to this new video in this 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.629
 video what I'm going to do is tell 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.960
 a little bit of what I'm going to do to 

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:15.610
 prepare for my next 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.349
 16 a pitcher my cameramen 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.060
 professionals in this video I'm going to 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:21.310
 teach point to point the things that I 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.910
 I'm going to do to be able to improve something 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.800
 brothers are watching background of me 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.660
 ok one of the first points that I 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.939
 would try would be the fact that lubricate 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.730
 these cubes I personally lubricious my 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.379
 cubes about two weeks before the 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.449
 tournament but if it's a cube that I use 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:39.400
 too he signed it a week before 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:40.989
 so that the lubricant effect that 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.879
 decides is cool to achieve the tournament 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:44.769
 it may sound like something super obvious but 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:46.629
 I know people who go with their bucket in 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:49.000
 the worst conditions and that still 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:49.780
 Well, it's the cube they're trying to use to 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.549
 to compete 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.530
 personally I do not recommend this anymore 

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:55.210
 that the cube may sometimes affect your 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.799
 performance there are seeing how 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.019
 first clean my bucket and then what 

00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:00.820
 I start to assemble and lubricate but I 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:02.260
 I recommend that all the cubes to which 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.210
 go to enter the lubricate is more or 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.950
 minus one week before one or two 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.260
 depending how much you practice that 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.090
 category if the practice is very much a 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.930
 week before and if you do not practice so much 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.700
 well 2 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.530
 even three weeks before then 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.960
 this is the first point lubricates your 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.240
 cubes and give them a maintenance a couple 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.520
 of days before the tournament and the second 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.290
 point that I expose practice your points 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.450
 weak are seeing that I am 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.580
 practicing only cll in the video 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.979
 because for example cll is not a point 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.410
 weak of me but I want to improve a lot 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:34.150
 I want to be much faster in cll if in 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.190
 your case for example is bad in the last 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.860
 layer 3 by 3 spend much time 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.420
 That is, dedicating time to your weaknesses to 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.060
 the categories in what you may not be 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.009
 so good in these cubes that is good 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.810
 but you feel that you can improve or 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:49.420
 even for example in three by three 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.369
 you may be very bad in this 20 in the 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.470
 last layer then then practice more 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.570
 the f 2 l well somehow you're 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.360
 practicing your weakness and you can get there 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.490
 to the tournament already with everything practiced 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.410
 somehow your weakness will no longer be your 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.450
 weakness but it will be a point that 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.640
 As you have worked hard, you will be in 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.119
 your best conditions for the time of 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.119
 to compete 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.620
 the next point is that you practice with 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.300
 friends this becomes something very motivating 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.760
 since you are somehow in a 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.650
 commitment to them and yourself is 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.390
 It's fun and practicing is not a 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.690
 monotonous activity if you're together with 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.690
 they 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.960
 another thing that may seem super obvious 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.570
 but I see that many people do not 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.430
 they do is choose their mails I feel if the 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.410
 video the camera moves a lot but 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.970
 helped me record it my brother and has 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.920
 I strike a little maracas 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.270
 I recommend that a time before define 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.670
 which cubes are you going to use for 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.860
 competition lubricate in those cubes use 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.330
 those cubes to practice so that the 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.530
 Tournament Time are super super 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.660
 used to them 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.400
 how many times have we not seen this in a 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.680
 tournament you can call it how you want 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.450
 basically it's the cube you have in the 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.610
 hands and the cube that you move while 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.990
 you are in the tournament many know that 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.060
 you have to go and deliver your cube to the 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.400
 table to make the scrum ball and everything 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.440
 that kind of details then you do not 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.350
 you can have the cube to practice 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.350
 I personally always carry a bucket to 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.000
 one side for example if I go to 7 times 7 do not 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.330
 I have a 7 by 7 on the side but maybe 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.580
 a 5 by 5 a 6 by 6 something similar in 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.410
 that somehow helps me to 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:30.550
 keep practicing even if I do not have my 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:33.070
 main with me and here a small fail with 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.730
 my little brother that he is the best judge of the 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.730
 check world 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:57.900
 and you are ready 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.060
 hehe 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.590
 another thing that happened to me a little bit ago 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:10.019
 in a tournament that I went to was that I 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.569
 I was super super super used to 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:14.069
 use of the phone as a place joel 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:16.500
 where else did he practice in high school 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:19.070
 I was used to using the 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.720
 phone then when I got to the 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.550
 tournament and had to use the timer of 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.990
 again I was super badly used 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.930
 then one of my recommendations 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:30.389
 personal is that you change and start 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.760
 practice with him with the timer the truth 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:34.380
 is that by using the timer you get used to 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.570
 be in an environment where you will be 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.430
 in the official tournament you will be exact 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.110
 exactly using the timer you are not going to 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.419
 use a telephone in the official tournament 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.280
 computer or anything then I recommend 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:46.350
 that the last two weeks before the 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.630
 tournament terol you dedicate to practice 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.639
 only with timer practically this 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.150
 will help you improve a lot at the time 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:53.150
 of the tournament 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.840
 the ones that seem most important to me is 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.729
 that we have to set goals for 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.770
 the tournament itself if you have not seen it 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:05.020
 little one uploaded a video of my goals for 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.240
 this 2015 busse tournament do something 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.069
 similarly set goals of where 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.110
 wants to stay when they want to average 

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:13.090
 in all the categories which ones are going to 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.650
 enter that they will be in total going to 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.720
 be in general to those who are going to know 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:19.060
 even another one of the points and these are 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.470
 I recommend that you read the rules 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.169
 the first time you go to a tournament 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:25.210
 official seems like a fool because all 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:27.580
 the possible rules there are the infringe 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:29.620
 is not to be what achievement is not even half 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.330
 normal if you give a law of the rules 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.310
 before this, you avoid all that 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.750
 kind of problems to the first tournament that 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.819
 it was me who was scolding me 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.099
 practically all day because I was 

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:41.500
 making an error after error are many 

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:43.780
 but they are simple are things that you learn 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.130
 of memory then you do not even 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.380
 you have to learn to tell a legend 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.729
 You will know when you do something wrong when you do not 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.259
 You are doing nothing wrong, well 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:51.880
 while I was editing the video I gave myself 

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:53.979
 mind that I did not record a farewell 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.840
 but even this was the video today and 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:57.580
 you know that if you liked it you can give it light 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.139
 it helped in something to share it with your friends 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.680
 so that you make them happier and to 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:01.539
 what 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.220
 break all the world records in the 

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:04.539
 next tournament subscribe if you want to see
