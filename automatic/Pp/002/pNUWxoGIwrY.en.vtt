00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:15.590 
small to be not delivered and so every

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:18.939 
small to be not delivered and so every
consumer<00:06:15.979> is<00:06:16.250> very<00:06:16.490> important<00:06:17.150> so<00:06:17.419> and<00:06:17.949> it

00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:18.949 
consumer is very important so and it

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:22.480 
consumer is very important so and it
also<00:06:19.000> stimulated<00:06:20.000> me<00:06:20.150> to<00:06:20.360> see<00:06:20.740> every<00:06:21.740> producer

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:22.490

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:30.620 
we also should maybe personalize it even

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:34.030 
we also should maybe personalize it even
more<00:06:30.830> so<00:06:31.460> that<00:06:31.490> this<00:06:32.479> single<00:06:32.839> box<00:06:33.259> sold<00:06:33.620> in<00:06:33.830> the
