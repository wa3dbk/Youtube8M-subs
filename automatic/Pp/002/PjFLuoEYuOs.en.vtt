one spare pair of wheels now unlike

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.680 
one spare pair of wheels now unlike
ordinary<00:00:38.309> team<00:00:38.640> cars<00:00:38.910> obviously<00:00:39.270> there's

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
ordinary team cars obviously there's

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.869

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
only two seats in there so again it has

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.250 
only two seats in there so again it has
to<00:00:41.910> be<00:00:42.090> for<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.270> Time<00:00:42.480> Trial<00:00:42.750> because<00:00:43.050> I've<00:00:43.170> so

you've<00:00:43.379> just<00:00:43.410> got<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.800> D<00:00:43.980> s<00:00:44.129> then<00:00:44.610> the

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
you've just got the D s then the

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.860 
you've just got the D s then the
mechanic<00:00:45.149> there<00:00:45.300> there's<00:00:45.539> no<00:00:45.690> room<00:00:45.840> for

anything<00:00:46.200> else<00:00:46.469> potentially<00:00:47.309> you<00:00:47.370> could<00:00:47.430> put

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
anything else potentially you could put

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
some wet bags in the boot but I can't

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.389 
some wet bags in the boot but I can't
imagine<00:00:49.320> there's<00:00:49.680> room<00:00:49.860> for<00:00:49.890> all<00:00:50.070> that<00:00:50.129> many

imagine there's room for all that many
you<00:00:50.820> obviously<00:00:51.149> couldn't<00:00:51.300> use<00:00:51.539> it<00:00:51.570> on<00:00:51.989> a

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
you obviously couldn't use it on a

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.299 
you obviously couldn't use it on a
normal<00:00:52.350> stage<00:00:52.620> because<00:00:52.860> you<00:00:52.980> need<00:00:53.129> eight

spare bikes for that instance and you

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.959 
spare bikes for that instance and you
can<00:00:55.320> only<00:00:55.440> get<00:00:55.590> two<00:00:55.920> on<00:00:56.129> here<00:00:56.430> might<00:00:56.820> perhaps

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
can only get two on here might perhaps

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.279 
can only get two on here might perhaps
you<00:00:57.180> get<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.390> stop<00:00:57.570> by<00:00:57.629> talking<00:00:57.930> me<00:00:58.020> through

a<00:01:20.909> concept<00:01:21.210> car<00:01:21.390> as<00:01:22.020> we<00:01:22.140> said<00:01:22.350> this<00:01:22.439> is<00:01:22.590> a

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
a concept car as we said this is a

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.649 
a concept car as we said this is a
collaboration<00:01:23.280> between<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.970> two<00:01:24.180> so<00:01:24.509> in

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
collaboration between the two so in

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.570 
collaboration between the two so in
order<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.900> tie<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.320> in<00:01:25.590> they've<00:01:26.009> brought<00:01:26.280> Team

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
order to tie it in they've brought Team

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.460 
order to tie it in they've brought Team
Sky<00:01:26.880> into<00:01:27.240> everywhere<00:01:27.780> they<00:01:27.930> possibly<00:01:28.229> can

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
Sky into everywhere they possibly can

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.590 
Sky into everywhere they possibly can
and<00:01:28.680> that<00:01:28.740> includes<00:01:29.360> carbon<00:01:30.360> fibre

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
and that includes carbon fibre

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.270 
and that includes carbon fibre
everywhere<00:01:31.049> nothing<00:01:31.409> since<00:01:31.650> cycling<00:01:32.130> and

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
carbon fibre so it's on the wheels it's

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.929 
carbon fibre so it's on the wheels it's

let's<00:01:40.979> go<00:01:41.100> take<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.280> look<00:01:41.369> inside<00:01:41.610> this<00:01:42.450> is

let's go take a look inside this is

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.569 
let's go take a look inside this is
unlike<00:01:42.930> any<00:01:43.170> team<00:01:43.530> car<00:01:43.740> I've<00:01:43.920> ever<00:01:44.159> been<00:01:44.430> in

unlike any team car I've ever been in
not<00:01:44.909> at<00:01:44.970> least<00:01:45.060> on<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.299> fact<00:01:45.509> that<00:01:45.689> there's

not at least on the fact that there's

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.330 
not at least on the fact that there's
only<00:01:46.140> two<00:01:46.409> seats<00:01:46.619> so<00:01:46.979> there's<00:01:47.100> no<00:01:47.189> earthly

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340

right<00:01:49.409> where<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.770> are<00:01:49.799> here<00:01:50.159> which<00:01:50.399> is

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
right where you are here which is

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.859 
right where you are here which is
probably<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.880> quite<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.119> treat<00:01:51.329> for<00:01:51.509> him<00:01:51.659> because

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
probably a quite a treat for him because

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.480 
probably a quite a treat for him because
normally<00:01:52.170> stuck<00:01:52.409> in<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.619> back<00:01:52.799> Team<00:01:53.220> Sky

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.859 
normally stuck in the back Team Sky
clearly<00:01:53.909> goes<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.210> very<00:01:54.299> core<00:01:54.420> of<00:01:54.780> this

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
clearly goes to the very core of this

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.359 
clearly goes to the very core of this
car<00:01:55.140> they've<00:01:55.320> got<00:01:55.470> their<00:01:55.619> corporate<00:01:56.009> colors

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
car they've got their corporate colors

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.520 
car they've got their corporate colors
all<00:01:56.790> over<00:01:57.149> even<00:01:57.299> woven<00:01:57.750> into<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.020> carbon<00:01:58.409> and

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
all over even woven into the carbon and

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.780 
all over even woven into the carbon and
everything<00:01:58.799> you<00:01:58.860> can<00:01:58.979> see<00:01:59.189> there<00:01:59.399> that's<00:01:59.520> got

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
everything you can see there that's got

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.149 
everything you can see there that's got
a<00:02:00.030> bit<00:02:00.479> of<00:02:00.600> a<00:02:00.630> bit<00:02:01.140> of<00:02:01.229> steam<00:02:01.469> sky<00:02:01.740> blue<00:02:02.040> in

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
a bit of a bit of steam sky blue in

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.440 
a bit of a bit of steam sky blue in
there<00:02:02.340> no<00:02:02.610> so<00:02:02.759> you<00:02:02.850> can't<00:02:03.000> have<00:02:03.119> a<00:02:03.180> rearview

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
there no so you can't have a rearview

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.300 
there no so you can't have a rearview
mirror<00:02:03.840> in<00:02:03.930> here<00:02:04.140> because<00:02:04.439> there's<00:02:04.950> no<00:02:05.070> window

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
mirror in here because there's no window

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.560 
mirror in here because there's no window
at<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.430> back<00:02:05.640> so<00:02:05.850> what<00:02:05.969> they've<00:02:06.090> got<00:02:06.329> is

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
at the back so what they've got is

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.479 
at the back so what they've got is
they've<00:02:07.079> replaced<00:02:07.320> that<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:07.860> put<00:02:08.009> in<00:02:08.069> a<00:02:08.129> TV

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
they've replaced that and put in a TV

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.760 
they've replaced that and put in a TV
screen<00:02:08.789> so<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.209> car<00:02:09.420> can<00:02:09.450> tune<00:02:09.899> into<00:02:10.080> live<00:02:10.379> TV

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
screen so the car can tune into live TV

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.290 
screen so the car can tune into live TV
so<00:02:11.220> that<00:02:11.340> even<00:02:11.489> when<00:02:11.580> they're<00:02:11.730> in<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.090> race

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
so that even when they're in the race

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.670 
so that even when they're in the race
they<00:02:12.629> can<00:02:12.750> actually<00:02:12.989> still<00:02:13.170> watch<00:02:13.349> it<00:02:13.379> now

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
they can actually still watch it now

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.649 
they can actually still watch it now
most<00:02:13.890> team<00:02:14.430> cars<00:02:14.640> have<00:02:14.849> that<00:02:15.060> but<00:02:15.269> none<00:02:15.450> have

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659 
most team cars have that but none have

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:17.300 
most team cars have that but none have
it<00:02:15.750> quite<00:02:15.989> as<00:02:16.109> neatly<00:02:16.319> as<00:02:16.409> that<00:02:16.709> you'll<00:02:17.159> also

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
it quite as neatly as that you'll also

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.099 
it quite as neatly as that you'll also
notice<00:02:17.579> that<00:02:17.760> there's<00:02:17.939> two<00:02:17.969> radios<00:02:18.510> here<00:02:18.750> now

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:19.109 
notice that there's two radios here now

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:21.259 
notice that there's two radios here now
again<00:02:19.469> all<00:02:19.709> team<00:02:19.920> cars<00:02:20.129> have<00:02:20.340> radios<00:02:20.790> both

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
again all team cars have radios both

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.030 
again all team cars have radios both
have<00:02:21.480> two<00:02:21.719> in<00:02:21.870> fact<00:02:22.079> one<00:02:22.409> so<00:02:22.560> they<00:02:22.650> can<00:02:22.769> talk<00:02:22.950> to

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
have two in fact one so they can talk to

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.459 
have two in fact one so they can talk to
the<00:02:23.099> rider<00:02:23.370> and<00:02:23.700> then<00:02:24.060> one<00:02:24.329> so<00:02:24.719> they<00:02:24.959> can<00:02:25.200> hear

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:25.469 
the rider and then one so they can hear

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:27.140 
the rider and then one so they can hear
from<00:02:25.709> the<00:02:25.769> race<00:02:26.040> so<00:02:26.280> they<00:02:26.400> can<00:02:26.670> talk<00:02:26.819> to<00:02:26.849> race

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
from the race so they can talk to race

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.000 
from the race so they can talk to race
radio<00:02:27.569> which<00:02:27.780> is<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:28.019> commissary<00:02:28.469> tell<00:02:28.890> them

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
radio which is the commissary tell them

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.129 
radio which is the commissary tell them
stuff<00:02:29.189> but<00:02:29.790> normally<00:02:30.239> it<00:02:30.659> would<00:02:30.810> never<00:02:31.019> be

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:31.139 
stuff but normally it would never be

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:32.569 
stuff but normally it would never be
quite<00:02:31.469> as<00:02:31.590> neat<00:02:31.799> as<00:02:31.950> this<00:02:32.129> they've<00:02:32.459> actually

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579 
quite as neat as this they've actually

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:34.729 
quite as neat as this they've actually
built<00:02:33.000> it<00:02:33.180> in<00:02:33.329> to<00:02:33.659> the<00:02:33.750> central<00:02:34.139> console<00:02:34.530> back

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
built it in to the central console back

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:35.629 
built it in to the central console back
here<00:02:34.980> so<00:02:35.099> they've<00:02:35.189> got<00:02:35.310> all<00:02:35.489> their

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:35.639 
here so they've got all their

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:38.000 
here so they've got all their
communications<00:02:36.420> inbuilt<00:02:37.019> into<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.260> car<00:02:37.500> now

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
communications inbuilt into the car now

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.379 
communications inbuilt into the car now
the<00:02:38.069> other<00:02:38.310> particularly<00:02:38.700> neat<00:02:38.849> feature<00:02:39.090> is

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:39.389 
the other particularly neat feature is

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:41.539 
the other particularly neat feature is
aside<00:02:39.840> from<00:02:39.870> the<00:02:40.079> TV<00:02:40.260> they've<00:02:41.129> got<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:41.430> usual

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
aside from the TV they've got the usual

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:44.569 
aside from the TV they've got the usual
sat-nav<00:02:42.000> and<00:02:42.510> TV<00:02:43.260> function<00:02:43.680> built<00:02:43.889> in<00:02:44.069> what<00:02:44.459> it

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
sat-nav and TV function built in what it

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:46.220 
sat-nav and TV function built in what it
means<00:02:44.819> is<00:02:45.329> that<00:02:45.389> the<00:02:45.599> cameras<00:02:45.989> that<00:02:46.019> you

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
means is that the cameras that you

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.080 
means is that the cameras that you
normally<00:02:46.560> use<00:02:46.590> for<00:02:46.859> reversing<00:02:47.400> can<00:02:47.730> actually

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
normally use for reversing can actually

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.729 
normally use for reversing can actually
be<00:02:48.239> showing<00:02:48.659> what<00:02:48.870> a<00:02:48.900> rider<00:02:49.260> is<00:02:49.409> doing<00:02:49.620> behind

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
be showing what a rider is doing behind

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.909 
be showing what a rider is doing behind
so<00:02:50.310> if<00:02:50.669> a<00:02:50.879> rider<00:02:51.060> punctures<00:02:51.629> and<00:02:51.780> they<00:02:52.709> need<00:02:52.829> to

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:52.919 
so if a rider punctures and they need to

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:55.039 
so if a rider punctures and they need to
be<00:02:52.980> paced<00:02:53.250> back<00:02:53.400> to<00:02:53.549> the<00:02:53.609> peloton<00:02:54.060> normally

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
be paced back to the peloton normally

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:56.240 
be paced back to the peloton normally
you'd<00:02:55.139> have<00:02:55.260> them<00:02:55.319> sat<00:02:55.590> on<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:55.739> back<00:02:55.889> bumper

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
you'd have them sat on the back bumper

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.440 
you'd have them sat on the back bumper
and<00:02:56.280> you'd<00:02:56.459> have<00:02:56.579> the<00:02:56.700> rearview<00:02:56.879> mirror<00:02:56.970> so

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
and you'd have the rearview mirror so

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:58.970 
and you'd have the rearview mirror so
you<00:02:57.540> can<00:02:57.720> gauge<00:02:58.139> your<00:02:58.319> speed<00:02:58.379> for<00:02:58.680> that<00:02:58.739> but

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
you can gauge your speed for that but

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.280 
you can gauge your speed for that but
with<00:02:59.069> this<00:02:59.219> you<00:02:59.730> actually<00:02:59.969> get<00:03:00.090> them<00:03:00.209> on<00:03:00.329> TV<00:03:00.989> so

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
with this you actually get them on TV so

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.709 
with this you actually get them on TV so
that<00:03:01.319> will<00:03:01.680> be<00:03:01.829> an<00:03:02.310> entirely<00:03:02.639> new<00:03:02.760> approach<00:03:03.389> to

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:03.719 
that will be an entirely new approach to

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:06.770 
that will be an entirely new approach to
seeing<00:03:04.290> a<00:03:04.379> race<00:03:04.609> through<00:03:05.609> your<00:03:05.790> car<00:03:06.000> rear<00:03:06.599> view

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
seeing a race through your car rear view

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.990 
seeing a race through your car rear view
mirror<00:03:07.019> I<00:03:07.169> like<00:03:07.439> that<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:08.340> other<00:03:08.459> thing<00:03:08.700> for

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
mirror I like that the other thing for

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.059 
mirror I like that the other thing for
for<00:03:09.480> car<00:03:09.689> freaks<00:03:09.989> out<00:03:10.139> there<00:03:10.409> is<00:03:10.530> that<00:03:10.889> this<00:03:11.010> is

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
for car freaks out there is that this is

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.159 
for car freaks out there is that this is
a<00:03:11.219> semi<00:03:11.549> automatic<00:03:11.760> now<00:03:12.389> you<00:03:12.450> probably<00:03:12.959> never

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:13.169 
a semi automatic now you probably never

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:14.629 
a semi automatic now you probably never
really<00:03:13.409> want<00:03:13.620> an<00:03:13.739> automatic<00:03:14.010> team<00:03:14.430> car

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:14.639 
really want an automatic team car

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:16.819 
really want an automatic team car
because<00:03:14.969> the<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:15.719> slight<00:03:16.079> lack<00:03:16.349> of<00:03:16.500> control

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
because the the slight lack of control

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:18.199 
because the the slight lack of control
you<00:03:16.919> get<00:03:17.069> over<00:03:17.250> the<00:03:17.340> speed<00:03:17.579> but<00:03:17.790> with<00:03:17.909> a<00:03:17.940> semi

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
you get over the speed but with a semi

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.569 
you get over the speed but with a semi
automatic<00:03:18.709> it's<00:03:19.709> got<00:03:19.829> all<00:03:19.979> over<00:03:20.010> I<00:03:20.340> don't<00:03:20.519> know

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
automatic it's got all over I don't know

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:21.979 
automatic it's got all over I don't know
what<00:03:20.669> this<00:03:20.729> car<00:03:20.970> be<00:03:21.090> like<00:03:21.239> driving<00:03:21.449> at<00:03:21.690> 50

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
what this car be like driving at 50

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.149 
what this car be like driving at 50
kilometres<00:03:22.409> an<00:03:22.500> hour<00:03:22.620> I<00:03:22.739> think<00:03:22.979> it'd<00:03:23.069> probably

00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:23.159 
kilometres an hour I think it'd probably

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:25.250 
kilometres an hour I think it'd probably
feel<00:03:23.519> quite<00:03:23.699> frustrating<00:03:24.209> but<00:03:24.449> clearly<00:03:25.049> it's

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
feel quite frustrating but clearly it's

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.559 
feel quite frustrating but clearly it's
able<00:03:25.379> to<00:03:25.470> do<00:03:25.650> so<00:03:25.829> right<00:03:26.609> then<00:03:26.760> you<00:03:27.329> see<00:03:27.479> what

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
able to do so right then you see what

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:47.350 
able to do so right then you see what
this<00:03:27.629> team<00:03:27.780> car<00:03:28.019> can<00:03:28.169> do<00:03:28.290> let's<00:03:28.979> go

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.420
