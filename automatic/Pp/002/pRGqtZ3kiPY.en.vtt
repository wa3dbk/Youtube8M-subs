 French complexes namely the 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.170
 hips thighs and finally belly 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.470
 let's start with the hips and the 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.080
 thighs 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.910
 about angels it is necessary to 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.160
 restructure the volume that is to say 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.890
 forget the hips and bring a 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.950
 maximum volume at the shoulders 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.649
 how to initially reach of 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.989
 epaulettes wear dresses of shape in 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.780
 worse, that is, pinching under the chest 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.210
 and flared and fluid down to 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.370
 precisely camouflage a maximum 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.399
 generous hips 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:52.710
 then apply a maximum of 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:56.250
 pants or jinn's forms 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:59.460
 right use a maximum two 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.890
 flared tunics and rather in 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.899
 fluid materials not to be 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.700
 wear jeans or pants 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:11.400
 of slim shape and finally pay attention to not 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.470
 not too much to mark the size here mom 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.259
 the thighs complex we go 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.900
 put the focus on the bust and make 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.659
 forget a maximum the thighs for that 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.020
 carried a maximum of the poles is 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:28.530
 also do not over-center the waist 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.229
 and wore trousers or jeans from 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.689
 straight shape so avoid absolutely 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:37.560
 the slim unless wearing very high 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:40.470
 heels to rebalance finally never 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.299
 wearing long shoulder bag that has 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.909
 tendency to mark the hips and 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.680

 maximum fluidity especially in 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.340
 dresses and in the unique tops 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.929
 ideally avoid wearing 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.910
 stretch materials that tend to 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:10.450
