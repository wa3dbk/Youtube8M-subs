00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:12.150
 hello my name is good maxim and 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.039
 now we take a look at iphone 5s 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.750
 this is a preview though i 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:17.160
 I will try to tell as much as possible 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.990
 about this device 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.180
 the first thing that strikes you is 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.580
 new apple box comes back to 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.369
 the origins of making such beautiful packaging with 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.770
 device at right angles but the box 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.309
 we are not interested we are interested in iphone 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:34.949
 5s in front of me is a black version 5 with which 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.530
 still different from black iphone 5 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:39.840
 This is space gray. Our color is simpler. 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.120
 say graphite looks to me 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.120
 better as the edge of the steel and silver 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.160
 it already looks like iphone 4 and 4s 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.500
 generally I think that the foursome 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.079
 prettier and more expensive five looks but 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.750
 again my opinion behind also 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.390
 flash form factor has changed now 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.030
 there are generally two flashes one 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.800
 removes white with another yellow need 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.690
 this is for better quality 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.789
 photos go further 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.950
 the home button is different from the old one and 

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:09.840
 the new iphone is no longer on it 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.930
 square and metal appeared 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.790
 edging without a square and life is not that 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.549
 looks nice edging too 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.380
 cool thing but the sense of a button at all 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.049
 not in design but in the fact that it is from itself 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.700
 she represents biometric that is 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.790
 be able to read fingerprints 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.590
 let's check how it works I already 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.960
 configured this feature but show and 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.820
 I'll tell you how it works now so that 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.979
 You can unlock the phone either like 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.259
 enter a password earlier or just 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.799
 hold your finger on the button and turn on 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.110
 menu 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.299
 but I like doing it better 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.440
 just hold down the button for a second and 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.480
 release and the phone is unlocked 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.880
 This biometric sensor works 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.530
 incredibly cool you can water 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.810
 apply on either side and not 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.910
 worry that it won't work in 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.070
 You can add at least all your settings 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.140
 fingers of your friends true 5 pieces 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.300
 iphone reads lower skin layers so 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.950
 change of print is hardly required 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.240
 ever 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.160
 setting up a new imprint you need 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.890
 put your finger at the button several times 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.680
 while this screen is so beautifully filled 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.110
 You can also print your cat's paw. 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.180
 substitute he read their skin think 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.220
 tachadi function exactly the same 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.410
 It called it just the ground 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.990
 innovation it works great and 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.590
 really inspiring moving 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.690
 forward 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.450
 By the way on the sides you can see that 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.000
 the buttons are a little smaller and the recess 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.100
 under them in general there is no look in the end 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.490
 become better think you will be interested 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:39.220
 how ios 7 on iphone 5s shows itself 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.650
 actually 5s vs work a little 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.720
 faster especially for feedback 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.480
 on the home button or pull control 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.180
 The center here is set to 64-bit. 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.100
 system since the new a7 processor 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.320
 supports this possibility 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.440
 Incidentally this is the first in the world and p m 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:59.170
 64 bit processor for comparison here 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:02.230
 you tests geekbench 3 as you can see 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.660
 iphone 5s is twice as powerful as iphone 5 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.000
 This affects the overall performance of the system. 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.950
 but you can check the real power 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.870
 only after a while 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.530
 many of the applications will work with 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.720
 64 bits also appeared in the iphone 5s 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.980
 new front camera which shoots 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.140
 now twice as good 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.730
 but the rear taught to shoot at all in 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.890
 120 fps sloome 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:27.040
 but I will tell you about this in full 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:29.590
 great iphone 5s review by the way iphone 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.860
 5s and iphone 5c we quickly got 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.800

 forget to see also 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.720
 iphone 5c preview and 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.460
 check out the movie about how to infinity blade 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.410
 3 runs on 5 without 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:50.410
 in comparison with the usual five
