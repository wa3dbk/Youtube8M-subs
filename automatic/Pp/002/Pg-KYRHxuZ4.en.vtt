howdy YouTube this is 1 or Monty 5 what
you're<00:00:03.210> looking<00:00:03.449> at<00:00:03.570> my<00:00:03.810> bio<00:00:04.140> late<00:00:04.470> camp<00:00:05.190> stove

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:06.080 
you're looking at my bio late camp stove

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.629 
you're looking at my bio late camp stove
this<00:00:07.080> is<00:00:07.140> second<00:00:07.589> time<00:00:07.680> I've<00:00:07.830> actually<00:00:07.980> used

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
this is second time I've actually used

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.169 
this is second time I've actually used
it<00:00:09.599> and<00:00:09.750> so<00:00:10.469> far<00:00:10.679> I'm<00:00:10.950> pretty<00:00:11.250> impressed<00:00:11.610> I

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
it and so far I'm pretty impressed I

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.839 
it and so far I'm pretty impressed I
have<00:00:12.990> yet<00:00:13.259> to<00:00:13.290> use<00:00:13.559> it<00:00:13.710> for<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.250> power

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
have yet to use it for the power

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.859 
have yet to use it for the power
generation<00:00:15.299> aspect<00:00:15.929> of<00:00:16.080> it<00:00:16.460> but<00:00:17.460> I<00:00:18.060> do<00:00:18.420> see

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
generation aspect of it but I do see

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.060 
generation aspect of it but I do see
that<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.199> green<00:00:19.380> light<00:00:19.619> is<00:00:19.830> on

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
that the green light is on

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.570 
that the green light is on
and<00:00:20.670> it<00:00:20.910> comes<00:00:21.090> on<00:00:21.150> pretty<00:00:21.420> quick<00:00:22.340> once<00:00:23.340> the

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
and it comes on pretty quick once the

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.890 
and it comes on pretty quick once the
you<00:00:23.910> know<00:00:24.000> you<00:00:24.090> start<00:00:24.330> getting<00:00:24.539> some<00:00:24.570> flames

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
you know you start getting some flames

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.540 
you know you start getting some flames
that<00:00:25.050> are<00:00:25.109> above<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.619> canister<00:00:26.510> it<00:00:28.460> you<00:00:29.460> know

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
that are above the canister it you know

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.930 
that are above the canister it you know
it<00:00:29.929> shortly<00:00:30.929> green<00:00:31.679> light<00:00:31.830> comes<00:00:32.040> on<00:00:32.189> I<00:00:32.430> assume

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
it shortly green light comes on I assume

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.959 
it shortly green light comes on I assume
the<00:00:33.690> green<00:00:33.870> light<00:00:34.050> will<00:00:34.200> turn<00:00:34.530> on<00:00:34.680> faster<00:00:35.280> so

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
the green light will turn on faster so

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.680 
the green light will turn on faster so
long<00:00:36.120> as<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.360> internal<00:00:37.050> battery<00:00:37.230> is<00:00:37.620> a

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
long as the internal battery is a

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.990 
long as the internal battery is a
charged<00:00:39.690> up<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:40.160> capacity<00:00:41.160> so<00:00:41.760> if<00:00:41.879> you're

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
charged up to capacity so if you're

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.770 
charged up to capacity so if you're
running<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:42.329> dead

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
running it dead

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.619 
running it dead
you<00:00:43.410> know<00:00:43.530> before<00:00:43.980> starting<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:45.239> camp<00:00:45.420> stove

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
you know before starting a camp stove

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.110 
you know before starting a camp stove
just<00:00:45.960> enough<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.379> just<00:00:46.559> keep<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.370> fan<00:00:47.879> going

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
just enough to just keep the fan going

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.639 
just enough to just keep the fan going
then<00:00:48.750> yeah<00:00:48.899> I'll<00:00:48.989> probably<00:00:49.110> take<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.440> lot

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
then yeah I'll probably take a lot

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.389 
then yeah I'll probably take a lot
longer<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:50.039> turn<00:00:50.910> on<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.270> charging<00:00:51.870> state

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
longer to turn on to a charging state

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:55.490 
longer to turn on to a charging state
but<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.910> just<00:00:54.239> want<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.480> show<00:00:54.600> you<00:00:54.660> I<00:00:54.930> got<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.230> camp

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
but I just want to show you I got a camp

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.459 
but I just want to show you I got a camp
stove<00:00:55.940> it's<00:00:56.940> got<00:00:57.149> many<00:00:57.329> uses<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:58.140> mean

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
stove it's got many uses I mean

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.869 
stove it's got many uses I mean
obviously<00:00:58.710> I'm<00:00:59.190> right<00:00:59.399> now<00:00:59.520> I'm<00:00:59.670> boiling

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
obviously I'm right now I'm boiling

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.599 
obviously I'm right now I'm boiling
water<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.710> it<00:01:01.710> was<00:01:01.829> pretty<00:01:02.039> easy<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.430> start

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
water and it was pretty easy to start

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.240 
water and it was pretty easy to start
the<00:01:02.730> fire<00:01:02.910> I<00:01:03.180> did<00:01:03.750> have<00:01:03.899> one<00:01:04.080> mishap<00:01:04.500> where<00:01:04.769> I

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
the fire I did have one mishap where I

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.310 
the fire I did have one mishap where I
started<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:05.970> fire<00:01:06.150> went<00:01:06.390> out<00:01:06.510> but<00:01:07.229> that's

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
started and the fire went out but that's

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.350 
started and the fire went out but that's
because<00:01:07.530> I<00:01:07.740> wasn't<00:01:07.920> too<00:01:08.220> quick<00:01:08.790> on<00:01:08.970> getting

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
because I wasn't too quick on getting

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.690 
because I wasn't too quick on getting
the<00:01:09.570> kindling<00:01:10.200> going<00:01:11.100> cuz<00:01:11.220> like<00:01:11.310> all<00:01:11.490> the

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
the kindling going cuz like all the

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.880 
the kindling going cuz like all the
kindling<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.270> have<00:01:12.510> would<00:01:13.350> be<00:01:13.409> hardwood

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
kindling that I have would be hardwood

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.310 
kindling that I have would be hardwood
flooring<00:01:14.220> pieces<00:01:14.760> which<00:01:15.030> I<00:01:15.390> think<00:01:16.229> the

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
flooring pieces which I think the

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.690 
flooring pieces which I think the
smallest<00:01:16.590> piece<00:01:16.920> was<00:01:17.100> probably<00:01:17.369> about<00:01:17.520> this

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
smallest piece was probably about this

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.090 
smallest piece was probably about this
big<00:01:17.759> so<00:01:18.659> because<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.500> didn't<00:01:19.680> use<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.830> fire

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
big so because I didn't use a fire

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.660 
big so because I didn't use a fire
starter<00:01:20.549> all<00:01:20.850> I<00:01:20.880> used<00:01:21.180> was<00:01:21.950> some<00:01:22.950> newspapers

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
starter all I used was some newspapers

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.020 
starter all I used was some newspapers
and<00:01:24.950> got<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:26.040> going<00:01:26.070> for<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.490> short<00:01:26.700> bit<00:01:26.850> but<00:01:26.970> it

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
and got it going for a short bit but it

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.319 
and got it going for a short bit but it
wasn't<00:01:27.270> enough<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.659> keep<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:28.020> going<00:01:28.700> so<00:01:29.700> I<00:01:29.970> just

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
wasn't enough to keep it going so I just

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.270 
wasn't enough to keep it going so I just
started<00:01:30.540> up<00:01:30.659> again<00:01:30.780> I<00:01:31.110> also<00:01:31.579> use<00:01:32.579> this<00:01:32.939> guy<00:01:33.170> and

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
started up again I also use this guy and

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.890 
started up again I also use this guy and
these<00:01:35.280> things<00:01:35.490> are<00:01:35.670> not<00:01:35.790> easy<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.329> use<00:01:36.360> however

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
these things are not easy to use however

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.340 
these things are not easy to use however
it<00:01:37.619> does<00:01:37.860> work<00:01:38.100> it<00:01:38.340> just<00:01:38.670> took<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.600> took<00:01:40.290> a

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
it does work it just took a took a

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.190 
it does work it just took a took a
little<00:01:40.470> effort<00:01:40.880> but<00:01:41.880> uh<00:01:41.909> I<00:01:42.420> was<00:01:43.049> pretty

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
little effort but uh I was pretty

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.179 
little effort but uh I was pretty
impressed<00:01:43.290> that<00:01:43.530> was<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.799> first<00:01:44.009> time<00:01:44.100> I've

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
impressed that was the first time I've

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.389 
impressed that was the first time I've
actually<00:01:44.250> use<00:01:44.579> that<00:01:44.790> it<00:01:44.970> worked<00:01:46.159> as<00:01:47.159> you<00:01:47.310> can

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
actually use that it worked as you can

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.249 
actually use that it worked as you can
see<00:01:47.579> I<00:01:47.610> no<00:01:47.850> longer<00:01:48.000> have<00:01:48.270> flames<00:01:48.570> coming<00:01:49.110> out

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
see I no longer have flames coming out

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.230 
see I no longer have flames coming out
so<00:01:49.860> more<00:01:50.250> like<00:01:50.430> I<00:01:50.579> need<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:50.759> put<00:01:50.939> some<00:01:51.090> more

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
so more like I need to put some more

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.530 
so more like I need to put some more
wood<00:01:51.930> in<00:01:52.049> there<00:01:52.200> so<00:01:53.189> just<00:01:53.700> put<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:53.970> big<00:01:54.210> guy<00:01:54.360> in

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
wood in there so just put the big guy in

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.810 
wood in there so just put the big guy in
there<00:01:55.579> and<00:01:56.579> I'm<00:01:57.509> boiling<00:01:58.219> hot<00:01:59.219> bolts<00:01:59.520> at<00:01:59.759> the

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
there and I'm boiling hot bolts at the

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:09.339 
there and I'm boiling hot bolts at the
moment<00:02:01.189> inside<00:02:04.430> there<00:02:05.780> and<00:02:06.780> put<00:02:07.110> that<00:02:07.140> on<00:02:07.409> top

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
moment inside there and put that on top

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:14.000 
moment inside there and put that on top
and<00:02:10.349> because<00:02:10.739> that<00:02:10.890> fan<00:02:11.160> is<00:02:11.660> blowing<00:02:12.980> you<00:02:13.980> know

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
and because that fan is blowing you know

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.540 
and because that fan is blowing you know
oxygen<00:02:14.250> into<00:02:14.849> the<00:02:14.940> fire<00:02:15.349> that<00:02:16.430> little<00:02:17.430> piece

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
oxygen into the fire that little piece

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.760 
oxygen into the fire that little piece
that<00:02:17.730> I<00:02:17.790> just<00:02:17.970> put<00:02:18.090> in<00:02:18.209> there<00:02:18.360> will<00:02:18.569> be<00:02:18.599> up<00:02:19.410> to<00:02:19.739> a

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
that I just put in there will be up to a

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.460 
that I just put in there will be up to a
temperature<00:02:20.640> and<00:02:20.970> cooking<00:02:21.330> in<00:02:21.900> no<00:02:22.080> time<00:02:22.319> and

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
temperature and cooking in no time and

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.740 
temperature and cooking in no time and
I'll<00:02:22.560> have<00:02:22.739> a<00:02:22.770> flames<00:02:23.760> shooting<00:02:24.330> up<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.569> side

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
I'll have a flames shooting up the side

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
I'll have a flames shooting up the side
again<00:02:25.250> but<00:02:26.540> yeah<00:02:27.540> I<00:02:27.569> would<00:02:27.780> say<00:02:27.810> boiling<00:02:28.470> time

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
again but yeah I would say boiling time

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.820 
again but yeah I would say boiling time
like<00:02:29.220> everybody<00:02:29.640> says<00:02:29.879> is<00:02:30.060> about<00:02:30.769> you<00:02:31.769> know

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
like everybody says is about you know

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.270 
like everybody says is about you know
some<00:02:32.640> between<00:02:33.290> 5<00:02:34.290> and<00:02:34.650> 10<00:02:34.890> minutes<00:02:35.069> depending

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
some between 5 and 10 minutes depending

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.410 
some between 5 and 10 minutes depending
on<00:02:35.519> how<00:02:37.580> what<00:02:38.580> the<00:02:38.670> temperature<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.060> water<00:02:39.239> is

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
on how what the temperature the water is

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.009 
on how what the temperature the water is
and<00:02:39.690> whatnot<00:02:40.790> we<00:02:41.790> see<00:02:41.970> like<00:02:42.150> you<00:02:42.239> know<00:02:42.269> take

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
and whatnot we see like you know take

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.600 
and whatnot we see like you know take
that<00:02:43.050> off<00:02:43.319> I<00:02:43.470> can't<00:02:43.680> seem<00:02:43.860> to<00:02:43.890> do<00:02:44.040> it<00:02:44.069> one<00:02:44.310> hand

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
that off I can't seem to do it one hand

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:54.040 
that off I can't seem to do it one hand
so<00:02:45.510> once<00:02:46.410> it

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:03:02.180 

you<00:02:55.050> can<00:02:55.200> see<00:02:55.880> we're<00:02:56.880> boiling<00:03:00.590> outside<00:03:01.590> you

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
you can see we're boiling outside you

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.090 
you can see we're boiling outside you
always<00:03:02.400> want<00:03:02.580> to<00:03:02.610> use<00:03:02.670> a<00:03:02.760> cap<00:03:03.950> just<00:03:04.950> like

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
always want to use a cap just like

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.360 
always want to use a cap just like
anything<00:03:05.430> else<00:03:05.700> if<00:03:06.030> you're<00:03:06.570> boiling<00:03:06.810> water<00:03:07.590> if

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
anything else if you're boiling water if

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.170 
anything else if you're boiling water if
the<00:03:08.910> any<00:03:09.600> bit<00:03:09.840> of<00:03:09.870> cut<00:03:10.110> the<00:03:10.440> seen<00:03:11.190> can<00:03:11.430> rise<00:03:11.940> and

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
the any bit of cut the seen can rise and

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.950 
the any bit of cut the seen can rise and
escape<00:03:12.540> then

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 
escape then

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.690 
escape then
yeah<00:03:13.200> the<00:03:13.350> wire<00:03:13.530> is<00:03:13.650> going<00:03:13.830> to<00:03:13.920> lower<00:03:14.550> in

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
yeah the wire is going to lower in

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.700 
yeah the wire is going to lower in
temperature<00:03:17.630> yeah<00:03:18.630> that's<00:03:18.960> pretty<00:03:19.260> much<00:03:19.350> done

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:19.710 
temperature yeah that's pretty much done

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.640 
temperature yeah that's pretty much done
I<00:03:19.950> think<00:03:20.160> I'm<00:03:20.460> just<00:03:20.550> going<00:03:20.760> to<00:03:20.790> keep<00:03:20.910> let<00:03:21.180> it<00:03:21.270> go

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
I think I'm just going to keep let it go

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.560 
I think I'm just going to keep let it go
until<00:03:22.650> it<00:03:22.770> burns<00:03:22.980> itself<00:03:23.220> out<00:03:23.430> if<00:03:24.180> you<00:03:24.300> let<00:03:24.450> it

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
until it burns itself out if you let it

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.880 
until it burns itself out if you let it
burn<00:03:24.660> itself<00:03:24.840> out<00:03:25.880> it<00:03:26.880> will<00:03:27.380> lead<00:03:28.380> nothing<00:03:28.740> but

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
burn itself out it will lead nothing but

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.760 
burn itself out it will lead nothing but
ash<00:03:29.070> so<00:03:29.670> it's<00:03:29.790> a<00:03:29.820> pretty<00:03:30.000> clean<00:03:30.300> burn<00:03:30.620> like<00:03:31.620> so

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
ash so it's a pretty clean burn like so

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.630 
ash so it's a pretty clean burn like so
this<00:03:31.920> is<00:03:31.980> the<00:03:32.070> second<00:03:32.430> time<00:03:32.550> I've<00:03:32.730> used<00:03:32.970> it<00:03:33.180> and

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
this is the second time I've used it and

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.430 
this is the second time I've used it and
all<00:03:35.640> I<00:03:35.760> did<00:03:35.910> had<00:03:36.300> all<00:03:36.600> I<00:03:36.630> do<00:03:36.750> is<00:03:36.960> just<00:03:36.990> dump<00:03:37.350> some

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
all I did had all I do is just dump some

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.620 
all I did had all I do is just dump some
ash<00:03:37.680> out<00:03:37.920> and<00:03:38.100> wasn't<00:03:38.220> a<00:03:38.400> lot<00:03:38.610> either<00:03:38.640> so<00:03:39.600> just

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.320 
ash out and wasn't a lot either so just
couple<00:03:40.170> taps<00:03:40.470> and<00:03:40.740> he's<00:03:41.010> good<00:03:41.160> to<00:03:41.250> go

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
couple taps and he's good to go

couple taps and he's good to go
as<00:03:42.930> you<00:03:43.530> can<00:03:43.620> see<00:03:43.770> there's<00:03:43.980> a<00:03:44.040> little<00:03:44.400> bit<00:03:44.640> of

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
as you can see there's a little bit of

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.790 
as you can see there's a little bit of
blackness<00:03:45.510> around<00:03:45.900> the<00:03:45.990> pot<00:03:46.170> hopefully<00:03:46.590> you

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
blackness around the pot hopefully you

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.180 
blackness around the pot hopefully you
can<00:03:46.890> see<00:03:47.100> that<00:03:47.810> it's<00:03:48.810> not<00:03:49.110> a<00:03:49.350> lot<00:03:49.710> it's<00:03:50.070> not

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
was empty when I had the flame going on

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.630 
was empty when I had the flame going on
it<00:04:06.900> like<00:04:07.470> I<00:04:07.560> poured<00:04:07.980> the<00:04:08.010> water<00:04:08.220> out<00:04:08.430> and<00:04:08.460> just

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640

let it burn I did see some browning on

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.039 
let it burn I did see some browning on
the<00:04:12.630> inside<00:04:13.140> of<00:04:13.500> the<00:04:14.010> kettle<00:04:14.310> pot<00:04:14.930> but<00:04:15.930> it's

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
the inside of the kettle pot but it's

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.289 
the inside of the kettle pot but it's
like<00:04:16.140> two<00:04:16.290> three<00:04:16.620> spots<00:04:16.920> and<00:04:17.310> I<00:04:18.120> don't<00:04:18.239> know

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
like two three spots and I don't know

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:19.370 
like two three spots and I don't know
that<00:04:18.420> that's<00:04:18.540> like<00:04:18.780> you<00:04:18.900> know<00:04:18.930> because<00:04:19.170> it's

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
that that's like you know because it's

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.289 
that that's like you know because it's
heat<00:04:19.799> tempering<00:04:20.250> itself<00:04:20.609> because<00:04:21.000> the<00:04:21.090> fact

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
heat tempering itself because the fact

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.810 
heat tempering itself because the fact
that<00:04:21.420> it's<00:04:21.660> a<00:04:22.220> you<00:04:23.220> know<00:04:23.310> such<00:04:23.580> a<00:04:23.670> hot

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820

we got boiling we got flames and I
didn't<00:04:41.310> use<00:04:41.400> all<00:04:41.639> that<00:04:41.850> much<00:04:42.090> all<00:04:43.020> that<00:04:43.080> much

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
didn't use all that much all that much

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.189 
didn't use all that much all that much
wood<00:04:43.770> and<00:04:44.010> all<00:04:45.000> this<00:04:45.270> took<00:04:45.479> a<00:04:45.540> bit<00:04:45.900> you<00:04:46.139> know

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:46.199 
wood and all this took a bit you know

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:48.650 
wood and all this took a bit you know
probably<00:04:46.440> less<00:04:46.710> than<00:04:46.740> 10<00:04:47.040> minutes<00:04:47.190> total<00:04:47.660> so

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
probably less than 10 minutes total so

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.620 
probably less than 10 minutes total so
and<00:04:49.080> as<00:04:49.560> you<00:04:49.650> can<00:04:49.830> see<00:04:49.979> it's<00:04:50.130> snow<00:04:50.430> it's<00:04:51.300> at<00:04:51.510> the

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
and as you can see it's snow it's at the

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.400 
and as you can see it's snow it's at the
very<00:04:51.660> least<00:04:52.940> 3035<00:04:53.940> degrees<00:04:54.090> right<00:04:54.510> now<00:04:54.540> it's

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
very least 3035 degrees right now it's

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.770 
very least 3035 degrees right now it's
warming<00:04:55.650> up<00:04:55.740> from<00:04:55.949> what<00:04:56.070> it<00:04:56.160> was<00:04:56.340> so<00:04:56.910> the<00:04:57.570> snow

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
warming up from what it was so the snow

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:04.240 
warming up from what it was so the snow
is<00:04:57.960> melting<00:04:58.410> but<00:05:01.699> does<00:05:02.699> a<00:05:02.729> pretty<00:05:02.970> good<00:05:03.030> job<00:05:03.150> so

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
is melting but does a pretty good job so

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.970 
is melting but does a pretty good job so
all<00:05:05.250> right<00:05:05.370> until<00:05:05.580> next<00:05:05.729> time
