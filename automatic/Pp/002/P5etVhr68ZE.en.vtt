00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.470
 in a new video that will be for 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.780
 do a tutorial very short movies that is 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.219
 on the chocolate attempt this video 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.170
 you're interested I'll let you look 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.670
 then we start right away with 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.059
 the list of equipment you will have 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.510
 need 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:21.119
 you will need a job with a blade 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.189
 of colt or not all the mayors on 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.109
 carved for example of liquid sumo 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.320
 as nobody to apply the 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:34.559
 pastels a Simo color coil 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:39.660
 chocolate cooked to include in the pastel 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:41.100
 dry for trade winds rains of paint to 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.899
 oil or if you did not want 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.350
 use of clinic or gouache 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:49.050
 yellow color plane is optional to 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.100
 supply and parchment paper for 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.170
 make the mixtures 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.000
 then you will need the color 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.260
 cake dough for my part I use the 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:04.619
 great you will come bouquets a 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:06.600
 pretty thick band that you go 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.380
 rolling on itself to give it a 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:16.619
 twisted effect you go cut each 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:19.590
 and fruity that you think and then 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.500
 flattened you will come scrape 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.630
 dry pastel ray to give the cooked effect 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.549
 start with the lightest color 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.729
 and you end up with the most color 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.729
 dark 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:37.800
 then we will come to make the 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.140
 mix to make the color glaze 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.720
 custard 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:49.920
 put a little yellow a lot of white 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:52.920
 is really very very few others you 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.910
 then put this icing in the 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:59.520
 hollow of your hand twists applied 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:02.060
 roughly enough to achieve a 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.400
 much more realistic effect 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.140
 sprinkle on your pastry cream 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.179
 dry pastels marot but I advise 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.520
 instead of sea sand once sugar 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.459
 brown and then 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.650
 add some chocolate chips you 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:19.130
 can thus remove the excess with a 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.130
 small 1 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.620
 once kamini remains only 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.100
 mercury your twists at 110 degrees 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.260
 for 30 minutes 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.030
 this video is over I hope that 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.710
 you will have liked to do all these very 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.280
 big kisses and I say to myself next time 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.280
