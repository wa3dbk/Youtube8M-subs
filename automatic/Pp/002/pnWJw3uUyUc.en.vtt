00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.060 

when<00:00:00.210> I'm<00:00:00.480> playing<00:00:00.930> most<00:00:01.319> of<00:00:01.439> these<00:00:01.560> songs<00:00:01.800> I

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
when I'm playing most of these songs I

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.830 
when I'm playing most of these songs I
don't<00:00:02.159> even<00:00:02.340> know<00:00:02.520> what<00:00:02.669> key<00:00:02.879> I'm<00:00:03.060> in<00:00:03.240> and<00:00:03.480> it's

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
don't even know what key I'm in and it's

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.140 
don't even know what key I'm in and it's
just<00:00:04.140> because<00:00:04.500> I<00:00:04.740> find<00:00:05.490> a<00:00:05.609> place<00:00:05.819> where<00:00:06.000> it's

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
just because I find a place where it's

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.870 
just because I find a place where it's
it's<00:00:06.420> naturally<00:00:06.960> with<00:00:07.109> my<00:00:07.290> voice<00:00:07.500> and<00:00:07.880> moving

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
it's naturally with my voice and moving

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.390 
it's naturally with my voice and moving
the<00:00:08.970> capo<00:00:09.330> all<00:00:09.480> around<00:00:09.809> and<00:00:10.050> so<00:00:10.530> in<00:00:10.889> terms<00:00:11.160> of

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
the capo all around and so in terms of

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.940 
the capo all around and so in terms of
how<00:00:12.059> I<00:00:12.090> understand<00:00:12.990> chord<00:00:13.320> progressions<00:00:13.830> are

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
how I understand chord progressions are

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.349 
how I understand chord progressions are
how<00:00:14.190> I<00:00:14.219> understand<00:00:14.790> communicating<00:00:15.719> them<00:00:15.870> I

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:17.359 
how I understand communicating them I

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:21.820 
how I understand communicating them I
just<00:00:18.359> use<00:00:18.510> chord<00:00:18.869> degree<00:00:19.320> which<00:00:19.800> is<00:00:19.980> sort<00:00:20.250> of

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:21.830 
just use chord degree which is sort of

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.310 
just use chord degree which is sort of
if<00:00:22.830> you<00:00:22.890> imagine<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.939> simple<00:00:24.480> scale<00:00:24.810> like<00:00:25.170> the

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
if you imagine a simple scale like the

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:34.060 
if you imagine a simple scale like the
doremi<00:00:25.680> scale<00:00:29.689> if<00:00:30.689> you<00:00:30.960> are<00:00:31.109> in<00:00:31.349> that<00:00:31.619> key<00:00:32.009> and

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
doremi scale if you are in that key and

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.180 
doremi scale if you are in that key and
you<00:00:35.070> know<00:00:35.340> that<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:36.030> chord<00:00:36.870> by<00:00:37.380> definition<00:00:37.770> is

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
you know that a chord by definition is

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.979 
you know that a chord by definition is
really<00:00:38.340> just<00:00:38.700> taking<00:00:38.879> every<00:00:39.390> other<00:00:39.510> note<00:00:39.809> of<00:00:39.930> a

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
really just taking every other note of a

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.240 
really just taking every other note of a
scale<00:00:40.280> and<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.399> would<00:00:41.520> be<00:00:42.379> this<00:00:43.379> first<00:00:43.860> chord

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
scale and it would be this first chord

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.790 
scale and it would be this first chord
the<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:45.059> chord<00:00:45.780> that's<00:00:46.020> built<00:00:46.260> on<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.559> first

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
the the chord that's built on the first

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.410 
the the chord that's built on the first
note<00:00:47.039> of<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.280> scale<00:00:47.370> taking<00:00:48.090> every<00:00:48.300> other

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
note of the scale taking every other

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.400 
note of the scale taking every other
note<00:00:49.370> would<00:00:50.370> be<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.670> one<00:00:50.850> chord<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.410> if

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
note would be the one chord and if

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.369 
note would be the one chord and if
you're<00:00:53.329> playing<00:00:54.329> through<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.660> song<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.230> has

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
you're playing through a song and it has

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.139 
you're playing through a song and it has
a<00:00:55.410> chord<00:00:55.710> progression<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:56.280> like<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.489> one<00:00:56.789> four

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
a chord progression of like a one four

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.830 
a chord progression of like a one four
five<00:00:57.449> what<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:58.530> means<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:59.219> you<00:00:59.940> use<00:01:00.539> the

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
five what that means is you use the

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.930 
five what that means is you use the
chord<00:01:01.170> that<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:01.530> built<00:01:01.800> on<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.219> first<00:01:02.489> note<00:01:02.760> of

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
chord that is built on the first note of

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.549 
chord that is built on the first note of
the<00:01:03.059> scale<00:01:03.180> taking<00:01:03.870> every<00:01:04.170> other<00:01:04.290> note

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
the scale taking every other note

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.929 
the scale taking every other note
because<00:01:04.799> that's<00:01:04.949> what<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.159> chord<00:01:05.430> is<00:01:05.610> taking

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
because that's what a chord is taking

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.870 
because that's what a chord is taking
every<00:01:06.210> other<00:01:06.330> note<00:01:06.600> of<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.780> scale<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.740> then<00:01:08.610> you

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
every other note of a scale and then you

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.510 
every other note of a scale and then you
move<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.380> chord<00:01:10.770> that's<00:01:10.920> built<00:01:11.220> on<00:01:11.400> the

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
move to a chord that's built on the

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.160 
move to a chord that's built on the
fourth<00:01:11.820> note<00:01:12.060> of<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.270> scale<00:01:12.390> so<00:01:12.750> first<00:01:12.990> you'd

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
fourth note of the scale so first you'd

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.750 
fourth note of the scale so first you'd
count<00:01:13.350> up<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.740> find<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.100> fourth<00:01:14.369> note<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:14.610> the

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
count up and find the fourth note of the

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.179 
count up and find the fourth note of the
scale<00:01:15.920> do<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:16.950> five<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.420> then<00:01:19.350> starting<00:01:19.890> there

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
scale do a five and then starting there

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.109 
scale do a five and then starting there
you<00:01:20.430> take<00:01:20.670> every<00:01:21.030> other<00:01:21.150> note<00:01:21.450> of<00:01:21.570> scale

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.310 

so<00:01:24.899> that<00:01:25.289> note<00:01:25.829> of<00:01:26.520> these<00:01:26.700> this<00:01:27.030> these<00:01:27.450> three

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
so that note of these this these three

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.940 
so that note of these this these three
notes<00:01:28.530> this<00:01:28.799> triad<00:01:29.450> would<00:01:30.450> be<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.869> chord<00:01:31.469> built

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
notes this triad would be a chord built

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.249 
notes this triad would be a chord built
on<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.460> fourth<00:01:32.789> note<00:01:33.329> of<00:01:33.359> the<00:01:33.659> scale<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.200> that

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
on the fourth note of the scale and that

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.319 
on the fourth note of the scale and that
they<00:01:34.950> called<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.579> four<00:01:35.850> chord<00:01:36.210> okay<00:01:37.140> so<00:01:37.200> imagine

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 
they called a four chord okay so imagine

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:40.969 
they called a four chord okay so imagine
wherever<00:01:39.329> you<00:01:39.569> start<00:01:39.899> if<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.229> start<00:01:40.530> with<00:01:40.829> the

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
wherever you start if you start with the

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.620 
wherever you start if you start with the
second<00:01:41.399> note<00:01:41.549> you<00:01:41.850> could<00:01:42.000> call<00:01:42.209> it<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.420> two

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
second note you could call it a two

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.679 
second note you could call it a two
chord<00:01:42.990> so<00:01:43.829> you<00:01:44.189> start<00:01:44.579> here<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:44.939> take<00:01:45.360> every

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
chord so you start here and take every

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:51.620 
chord so you start here and take every
other<00:01:45.840> note<00:01:46.079> of<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.259> scale<00:01:49.520> I'm<00:01:50.520> doing<00:01:50.909> it<00:01:51.030> on

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
other note of the scale I'm doing it on

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.490 
other note of the scale I'm doing it on
a<00:01:52.399> real<00:01:53.399> sort<00:01:53.789> of<00:01:53.850> linear<00:01:54.179> one<00:01:54.689> string<00:01:55.109> method

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
a real sort of linear one string method

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.440 
a real sort of linear one string method
so<00:01:55.649> you<00:01:55.740> can<00:01:55.920> see<00:01:56.189> it<00:01:56.310> just<00:01:56.340> like<00:01:56.700> on<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.119> piano

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
so you can see it just like on a piano

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.850 
so you can see it just like on a piano
very<00:01:58.020> linear<00:01:59.479> but<00:02:00.479> in<00:02:00.720> every<00:02:00.989> tuning<00:02:01.380> there

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
very linear but in every tuning there

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.059 
very linear but in every tuning there
are<00:02:02.099> these<00:02:03.020> patterns<00:02:04.020> of<00:02:04.610> chords<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:05.849> so

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:07.069 
are these patterns of chords and so

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:10.880 
are these patterns of chords and so
whenever<00:02:08.069> I'm<00:02:08.569> finding<00:02:09.569> a<00:02:09.840> song<00:02:10.379> and<00:02:10.619> want<00:02:10.769> to

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
whenever I'm finding a song and want to

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.860 
whenever I'm finding a song and want to
communicate<00:02:11.069> what<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.730> chords<00:02:12.120> are<00:02:12.269> you<00:02:12.750> know

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
communicate what the chords are you know

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.470 
communicate what the chords are you know
I<00:02:13.049> can<00:02:13.349> say<00:02:13.709> okay<00:02:14.459> well<00:02:14.640> it<00:02:14.760> starts<00:02:15.180> with<00:02:15.239> the

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
I can say okay well it starts with the

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:29.620 
I can say okay well it starts with the
sixth<00:02:16.079> chord<00:02:16.349> then<00:02:17.010> it<00:02:17.129> goes<00:02:17.280> to<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.610> three

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.030 

when<00:02:30.630> it's<00:02:30.780> in<00:02:30.930> a<00:02:30.989> tuning<00:02:31.319> like<00:02:31.500> this<00:02:31.739> and<00:02:31.950> it's

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
when it's in a tuning like this and it's

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.550 
when it's in a tuning like this and it's
very<00:02:32.100> linear<00:02:32.519> you<00:02:32.880> can<00:02:32.910> sort<00:02:33.269> of<00:02:33.329> see<00:02:33.600> okay<00:02:34.019> six

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
very linear you can sort of see okay six

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.660 
very linear you can sort of see okay six
four

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
four

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.259 
four
you<00:02:35.970> know<00:02:36.090> and<00:02:36.420> it<00:02:36.959> moves<00:02:37.380> like<00:02:37.709> that<00:02:37.889> so<00:02:38.269> but

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
you know and it moves like that so but

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.449 
you know and it moves like that so but
in<00:02:39.480> other<00:02:39.660> tunings<00:02:40.109> it's<00:02:40.290> not<00:02:40.470> so<00:02:40.829> linear<00:02:41.099> but

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
in other tunings it's not so linear but

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.509 
in other tunings it's not so linear but
the<00:02:41.609> concept<00:02:42.120> I<00:02:42.239> want<00:02:42.420> to<00:02:42.510> get<00:02:43.170> across<00:02:43.319> is<00:02:43.859> just

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
the concept I want to get across is just

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.729 
the concept I want to get across is just
this<00:02:44.639> language<00:02:45.000> of<00:02:45.420> using<00:02:45.810> chord<00:02:46.139> degree

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
this language of using chord degree

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.729 
this language of using chord degree
instead<00:02:47.099> of<00:02:47.480> the<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:48.810> letter<00:02:49.049> names<00:02:49.380> of<00:02:49.620> the

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
instead of the the letter names of the

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.710 
instead of the the letter names of the
chords<00:02:49.920> because<00:02:50.370> when<00:02:50.609> you<00:02:50.760> shift<00:02:51.239> and<00:02:51.540> put<00:02:51.690> a

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
chords because when you shift and put a

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.159 
chords because when you shift and put a
capo<00:02:52.109> on<00:02:52.290> I<00:02:53.069> still<00:02:53.700> think<00:02:54.000> of<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.389> progression

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:55.169 
capo on I still think of the progression

00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:57.770 
capo on I still think of the progression
as<00:02:55.380> the<00:02:56.099> same<00:02:56.310> it's<00:02:56.549> chord<00:02:57.060> degree<00:02:57.510> that<00:02:57.750> I

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
as the same it's chord degree that I

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.830 
as the same it's chord degree that I
sort<00:02:58.290> of<00:02:58.380> got<00:02:58.799> acclimated<00:02:59.790> to<00:02:59.819> which<00:03:00.419> I<00:03:00.599> think

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
sort of got acclimated to which I think

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.750 
sort of got acclimated to which I think
for<00:03:00.989> open<00:03:01.319> tunings<00:03:01.680> for<00:03:02.130> me<00:03:02.250> it's<00:03:02.489> a<00:03:02.609> lot

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
for open tunings for me it's a lot

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.220 
for open tunings for me it's a lot
easier<00:03:03.090> than<00:03:03.739> then<00:03:05.510> using<00:03:06.510> the<00:03:06.690> sort<00:03:07.169> of

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
easier than then using the sort of

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.000 
easier than then using the sort of
absolute<00:03:07.859> reference<00:03:08.400> of<00:03:08.870> the<00:03:09.870> letter<00:03:10.709> names

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
absolute reference of the letter names

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.460 
absolute reference of the letter names
of<00:03:11.250> chords<00:03:11.609> because<00:03:12.090> when<00:03:12.329> you<00:03:12.450> you<00:03:12.810> shift<00:03:13.319> the

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
of chords because when you you shift the

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.259 
of chords because when you you shift the
capo<00:03:13.829> you<00:03:13.889> know<00:03:14.099> then<00:03:14.310> you've<00:03:14.459> got<00:03:15.150> your

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
capo you know then you've got your

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.490 
capo you know then you've got your
degree<00:03:15.870> you've<00:03:16.049> got

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
degree you've got

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:23.940 
degree you've got
so<00:03:17.980> this<00:03:18.100> is<00:03:18.250> our<00:03:18.400> new<00:03:18.610> key<00:03:21.360> doremi<00:03:22.360> scale<00:03:23.020> you

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
so this is our new key doremi scale you

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.470 
so this is our new key doremi scale you
take<00:03:24.190> the<00:03:24.340> fourth<00:03:24.610> note<00:03:24.820> of<00:03:24.940> the<00:03:25.000> scale<00:03:25.120> one

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
take the fourth note of the scale one

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:35.980 
take the fourth note of the scale one
more<00:03:26.260> than<00:03:26.560> your<00:03:26.770> 4<00:03:27.040> chord<00:03:27.330> here<00:03:28.330> three<00:03:29.080> cool

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:35.990 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.880 

1cor<00:03:36.500> so<00:03:37.370> when<00:03:38.240> I<00:03:38.270> described<00:03:39.170> in<00:03:39.500> all<00:03:39.680> these

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
1cor so when I described in all these

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:46.420 
1cor so when I described in all these
songs<00:03:41.440> what<00:03:42.440> chord<00:03:42.740> is<00:03:42.920> what<00:03:44.260> if<00:03:45.260> you<00:03:45.530> if<00:03:45.920> you

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
songs what chord is what if you if you

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.360 
songs what chord is what if you if you
are<00:03:46.820> unfamiliar<00:03:47.540> with<00:03:47.660> chord<00:03:48.140> degree<00:03:48.620> you<00:03:49.190> can

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
are unfamiliar with chord degree you can

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.430 
are unfamiliar with chord degree you can
always<00:03:49.700> find<00:03:50.150> it<00:03:50.360> you<00:03:50.510> just<00:03:50.720> know<00:03:50.930> what<00:03:51.200> key

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
always find it you just know what key

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.290 
always find it you just know what key
you're<00:03:51.650> in<00:03:51.710> you<00:03:52.010> count<00:03:52.370> up<00:03:52.580> on<00:03:52.820> the<00:03:52.970> strings

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
you're in you count up on the strings

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:58.600 
you're in you count up on the strings
the<00:03:53.870> doremi<00:03:54.260> scale<00:03:54.970> you<00:03:55.970> find<00:03:56.680> the<00:03:57.680> whatever

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
the doremi scale you find the whatever

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.330 
the doremi scale you find the whatever
degree<00:03:59.570> that<00:04:00.200> the<00:04:00.410> chord<00:04:00.680> is<00:04:00.890> you<00:04:01.070> know<00:04:01.160> like

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
degree that the chord is you know like

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.040 
degree that the chord is you know like
if<00:04:01.490> it's<00:04:01.640> a<00:04:01.760> six<00:04:02.030> chord<00:04:02.270> you<00:04:02.420> count<00:04:02.690> up<00:04:02.810> to<00:04:02.960> the

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.050 
if it's a six chord you count up to the

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.500 
if it's a six chord you count up to the
sixth<00:04:03.410> note<00:04:03.620> and<00:04:03.830> then<00:04:04.520> build<00:04:05.090> a<00:04:05.210> chord

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
sixth note and then build a chord

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.240 
sixth note and then build a chord
starting<00:04:06.020> there<00:04:06.350> and<00:04:06.560> what<00:04:06.860> does<00:04:06.980> that<00:04:07.010> mean

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
starting there and what does that mean

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:08.920 
starting there and what does that mean
build<00:04:07.610> a<00:04:07.730> chord<00:04:08.000> starting<00:04:08.360> there<00:04:08.540> it<00:04:08.720> means

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
build a chord starting there it means

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.560 
build a chord starting there it means
take<00:04:09.320> every<00:04:09.740> other<00:04:09.890> note<00:04:10.220> of<00:04:10.430> the<00:04:10.940> scale<00:04:11.180> that

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:11.570 
take every other note of the scale that

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.720 
take every other note of the scale that
you're<00:04:11.810> in<00:04:11.990> starting<00:04:12.830> on<00:04:12.950> that<00:04:13.100> note<00:04:13.340> that's<00:04:13.550> a

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
you're in starting on that note that's a

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.500 
you're in starting on that note that's a
sixth<00:04:14.000> chord<00:04:14.290> is<00:04:15.290> all<00:04:15.680> you'll<00:04:15.920> need<00:04:16.040> to<00:04:16.100> know

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
sixth chord is all you'll need to know

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.630 
sixth chord is all you'll need to know
thank<00:04:17.510> you
