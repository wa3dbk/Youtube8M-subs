 with the first in a series of videos 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.320
 really much in demand 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:14.009
 the tutorials to create custom maps on 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.379
 call of duty world at war the prerequisites 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.359
 they are not that many 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.180
 in addition to the patience you need to have e 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.279
 to the minimum of computer skills 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:26.970
 necessary to solve problems i 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:29.010
 fundamental prerequisites are 21 you must 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.309
 owning call of duty world at war 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.350
 updated to the latest patch 1.7 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.660
 preferably the language game 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.340
 English in Italian are presented 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.590
 of the problems is not said that not 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.270
 however, functions if they occur 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.030
 problems in the installation of the 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:49.890
 motul is probably because of 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.539
 language point 2 you need the mod tool in 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.879
 description I left you a link 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.219
 Click on the link and download the file 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.620
 rar that weighs roughly a little more than 1 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:02.149
 gb you will put some time in base 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.149
 at the speed of the internet connection 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.390
 the first step to start creating 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.820
 your custom maps is to 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.520
 obviously install the mod tool first 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.290
 unpack the rar file just about everything 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.630
 downloaded using a program like 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.490
 winrar or if makes asx compaction 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.650
 will take some time but once 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.650
 completed you will be in front of 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.049
 different folders each content of 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.670
 this folder had copied into the 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.920
 your game's directory 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.380
 then open the directory to one side 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.600
 of call of duty swimmer and on the other 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.020
 the folders then open the first one 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.150
 folder entitled mod tool 1.0 to his 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.520
 internal choose all the files present 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.380
 and drag there into the directory of 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.399
 installation of call of duty world at 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.140
 war 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.340
 then wait for the copy to be 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.409
 finished 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.240
 then we perform this operation for 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.119
 all other folders in order 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.110
 then progressive first then 1.0 then the 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.469
 1.1 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.899
 then the 1.2 and so on 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.420
 it is important that in case it comes 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.490
 asked whether to replace the files already 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.340
 existing we give the okay then 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.410
 we have to copy and replace the files 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.110
 exists 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.380
 once arrived to copy the files of 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.720
 mod tool 1.4 we run the same 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.110
 operation also for the nazi folder 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.640
 zombie tutorial there two then we open it 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.200
 we select the file inside it and there 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.780
 let's also move these to the directory 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.150
 of call of duty world at war the last fa 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.940
 it has remained today hicks script placer 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.860
 we can move it anywhere I want 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.810
 for convenience I preferred to put it also 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.520
 the one in the call of duty directory 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.570
 world at war but you can too 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:43.220
 put it on the desktop where you prefer 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:45.770
 well now that we have copied all the 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.790
 file we have to set the permissions we open 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:52.400
 the bean folder and for all files 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.390
 executables then point exe to his 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.570
 indoor 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:03:00.470
 we must put them incompatibility for 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:02.470
 windows xp service pack 3 and put the 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.150
 check to run as an administrator 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.920
 so for each file we do key 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.740
 right property 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.900
 let's go to the compatibility menu 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:14.150
 we click on execute incompatibilities e 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.700
 we choose and as an activity for windows 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.470
 xp service pack 3 finally we put the 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.020
 check execute as administrator who 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.700
 call its optics click on ok 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.680
 we do it for every single file 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.510
 executable except for the launcher 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.580
 for the launcher we select only 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:32.209
 option execute this file as 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:34.940
 administrator after setting i 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.800
 permits we are almost ready to leave 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.959
 open the application the launcher 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.239
 this window will appear as you can 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:43.459
 note on the left side there are various 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:46.250
 buttons we will have to press the last one 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:48.980
 button converter the operation 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.630
 will take some time there will be 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.030
 of the errors here and there of the writings 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.820
 red so you don't worry too much 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.220
 the important thing is that in the end a process 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:01.250
 ended at the bottom right there is the 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:04.409
 written r1 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.569
 now to make sure everything works 

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:09.150
 let 's proceed with the compilation of the map 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:11.370
 test that is included in this way 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.530
 tool then click on the writing 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.930
 nazi zombie tutorial by selecting 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:20.570
 precisely the map let us check them out 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:25.229
 compa the BSP comp highlights connect paz 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:29.310
 compile reflections build fast five bsp 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:32.190
 info and also the tick on specific mode 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:35.130
 map and select the map from the list 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:37.590
 in this case nazi zombie tutorial a 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.449
 once these ticks are inserted we can 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.150
 Click on the button at the bottom right 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:44.000
 compile laver here we have to lend 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.350
 particular attention because if the 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.419
 compilation crashes after a few 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:53.940
 seconds with these blue and red lettering and 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:55.770
 just above the word image is 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.660
 missing then means that 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.970
 we need the game in English 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:02.130
 so you need to get packages 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.349
 language a game in short version 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:07.139
 english to be able to make the 

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:10.080
 compiler if compiling instead 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:12.449
 it takes a few minutes and also opens 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.610
 the game several times during the course 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:17.340
 this process to compile the textures 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:19.050
 and the lights and so on and ends anyway 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.820
 with blue and red not written 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.780
 it matters means that the compilation is 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.729
 successful 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.860
 the writing will also confirm this 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:29.460
 success in the lower right corner 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:32.789
 proceed similarly for the nazi 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:35.340
 zombie tutorial patch let's select it ha 

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:37.680
 so from the menu this time the only ones 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:41.599
 which are to be enabled 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:44.520
 are that of the fast five and mode builds 

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:47.250
 specific map was always selected 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:49.050
 obviously the nazi zombie tutorial map 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:51.180
 then click on compile again 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:53.820
 this difference of the other will take 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:56.900
 really a few seconds ignore all the 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:58.880
 errors that are just shown 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.460
 we still miss a passage before 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:03.680
 we need to be able to test the map 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:06.039
 fill in the mode then click 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:09.110
 on the second mode builder card 

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:10.639
 we select nazi zombie tutorial from the 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:14.810
 list that just the map we need 

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:18.169
 go to compile we click on espuntas 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:21.259
 bild mode point ff fast file and bild ivi 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:23.389
 of files and bruises file list on the right 

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:25.160
 we must select all the files 

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:27.889
 present 

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:32.110
 then we take bild mode and finally 

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:35.000
 we wait for the mood to be filled out 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:36.770
 if you received a nice r mark and know 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.500
 that from the compilation of the mod 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:42.650
 you can finally close the launcher e 

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:45.320
 start the game now under the mode menu 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:47.510
 you can load the mode in question 

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:50.210
 nazi zombie tutorial in this case the 

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:51.229
 load and to be able to try them in 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:53.870
 single player 

00:06:51.229 --> 00:06:56.150
 we need to enable the game console 

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:59.090
 so let's go into the game options 

00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:00.979
 options game options and we will find 

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:04.010
 option enabled console 

00:07:00.979 --> 00:07:05.479
 let's put it on yes man and now to activate 

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:08.240
 the console we have to press the key 

00:07:05.479 --> 00:07:09.620
 slash that is near the 1 in key 

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:13.389
 top left on the keyboard 

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:15.979
 we press that key and write some map 

00:07:13.389 --> 00:07:18.470
 space map name in this case is 

00:07:15.979 --> 00:07:20.900
 nazi indent low zombie dash 

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:24.380
 low tutorial then we press enter e 

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:27.470
 the map will be loaded if there are none 

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:29.630
 errors of any kind and the map starts 

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:31.849
 then your compiler is 

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:33.620
 properly configured you can now 

00:07:31.849 --> 00:07:36.020
 start making your custom maps 

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:38.120
