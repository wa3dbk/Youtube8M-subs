becomes a core to read through and most
readers<00:02:32.220> will<00:02:32.640> be<00:02:32.790> wondering<00:02:33.300> when<00:02:33.540> the

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
readers will be wondering when the

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.600 
readers will be wondering when the
characters<00:02:34.110> are<00:02:34.140> just<00:02:34.680> going<00:02:35.040> to<00:02:35.069> get<00:02:35.340> to<00:02:35.519> the

characters are just going to get to the

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.000 
characters are just going to get to the
point<00:02:35.819> of<00:02:36.060> what<00:02:36.540> they<00:02:36.810> are<00:02:36.930> talking<00:02:37.140> about<00:02:37.410> it

point of what they are talking about it

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.550 
point of what they are talking about it
honestly<00:02:38.450> sounds<00:02:39.450> like<00:02:39.599> Hickman<00:02:40.019> is<00:02:40.140> trying

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
honestly sounds like Hickman is trying

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.619 
honestly sounds like Hickman is trying
to<00:02:40.769> make<00:02:40.950> what<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.519> cactus<00:02:41.910> are<00:02:42.120> talking

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
to make what the cactus are talking

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.229 
to make what the cactus are talking
about<00:02:42.750> sound<00:02:43.230> perform<00:02:43.709> and<00:02:43.950> epic<00:02:44.760> in<00:02:44.910> scope

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
about sound perform and epic in scope

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.170 
about sound perform and epic in scope
but<00:02:45.510> it<00:02:45.720> just<00:02:46.080> does<00:02:46.410> not<00:02:46.620> come<00:02:47.190> across<00:02:47.760> that

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
but it just does not come across that

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.910 
but it just does not come across that
way<00:02:48.450> it<00:02:48.750> feels<00:02:48.959> more<00:02:49.260> like<00:02:49.319> we're<00:02:49.709> just

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
way it feels more like we're just

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.710 
way it feels more like we're just
