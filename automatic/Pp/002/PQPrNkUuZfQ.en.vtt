not<00:02:21.450> gonna<00:02:21.600> be<00:02:21.720> as<00:02:21.810> a<00:02:21.840> pain<00:02:24.380> there<00:02:25.380> we<00:02:25.530> go<00:02:27.950> okay

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.040 

so<00:02:35.310> both<00:02:35.519> clamps<00:02:35.790> are<00:02:36.000> off<00:02:36.120> unfortunately<00:02:36.569> it

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
so both clamps are off unfortunately it

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.259 
so both clamps are off unfortunately it
broke<00:02:37.140> this<00:02:37.470> one<00:02:37.739> so<00:02:38.220> I'll<00:02:38.640> have<00:02:38.819> to<00:02:38.970> kind<00:02:39.180> of

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
broke this one so I'll have to kind of

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:40.550 
broke this one so I'll have to kind of
use<00:02:39.360> it<00:02:39.480> to<00:02:39.569> hold<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.810> exhaust<00:02:39.959> system<00:02:40.230> up

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
use it to hold the exhaust system up

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.380 
use it to hold the exhaust system up
while<00:02:41.160> and<00:02:41.400> you<00:02:41.489> want<00:02:41.670> to<00:02:41.730> hold<00:02:41.850> the<00:02:42.000> white<00:02:42.030> one

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
while and you want to hold the white one

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.860 
while and you want to hold the white one
no<00:02:42.630> big<00:02:43.530> deal<00:02:43.970> now<00:02:44.970> you<00:02:45.030> have<00:02:45.239> two<00:02:45.390> choices<00:02:45.600> you

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
no big deal now you have two choices you

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.210 
no big deal now you have two choices you
can<00:02:46.050> either<00:02:46.230> hammer<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.769> different<00:02:47.069> thing

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
can either hammer the different thing

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.430 
can either hammer the different thing
off<00:02:47.400> or<00:02:47.610> cut<00:02:48.060> it<00:02:48.180> off<00:02:48.330> so<00:02:48.660> I'm<00:02:48.780> gonna<00:02:48.900> try<00:02:49.170> a

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
off or cut it off so I'm gonna try a

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.039 
off or cut it off so I'm gonna try a
burring<00:02:49.769> and<00:02:50.250> then<00:02:51.000> I'm<00:02:51.120> gonna<00:02:51.239> go<00:02:51.450> ahead<00:02:51.690> and

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
burring and then I'm gonna go ahead and

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:53.449 
burring and then I'm gonna go ahead and
cut<00:02:52.290> it<00:02:52.319> off<00:02:52.530> because<00:02:52.769> hammering<00:02:53.280> is<00:02:53.340> not

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
cut it off because hammering is not

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.449 
cut it off because hammering is not
going<00:02:53.670> to<00:02:53.760> work<00:02:53.880> so<00:02:54.470> after<00:02:55.470> thinking<00:02:55.769> around<00:02:56.190> I

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
going to work so after thinking around I

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.320 
going to work so after thinking around I
found<00:02:56.700> a<00:02:56.790> good<00:02:56.910> angle<00:02:57.120> having<00:02:57.660> my<00:02:58.400> saw<00:02:59.400> upside

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
found a good angle having my saw upside

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.449 
found a good angle having my saw upside
down<00:03:00.600> and<00:03:01.080> just<00:03:01.500> cut<00:03:01.680> up<00:03:01.830> from<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.069> bottom<00:03:02.220> up

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
down and just cut up from the bottom up

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:03.890 
down and just cut up from the bottom up
to<00:03:02.610> the<00:03:02.640> top<00:03:02.730> here<00:03:03.180> and<00:03:03.239> I'm<00:03:03.299> about<00:03:03.569> to<00:03:03.630> finish

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
to the top here and I'm about to finish

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.789 
to the top here and I'm about to finish
cutting<00:03:04.200> off<00:03:04.579> the<00:03:06.350> white<00:03:07.350> from<00:03:07.560> the<00:03:07.650> back

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
cutting off the white from the back

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:12.820 
cutting off the white from the back
exhaust

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.490 

okay<00:03:13.830> with<00:03:14.130> the<00:03:14.220> back<00:03:14.370> cut<00:03:14.610> off<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:15.500> rear

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
okay with the back cut off the rear

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.840 
okay with the back cut off the rear
exhaust<00:03:16.680> pipe<00:03:17.130> fell<00:03:17.280> off<00:03:17.430> that's<00:03:17.670> the

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
exhaust pipe fell off that's the

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.360 
exhaust pipe fell off that's the
resonator<00:03:18.300> goes<00:03:18.900> up<00:03:19.080> over<00:03:19.320> the<00:03:19.410> axle<00:03:19.800> no<00:03:20.190> big

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
resonator goes up over the axle no big

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.720 
resonator goes up over the axle no big
deal<00:03:20.580> gives<00:03:21.060> us<00:03:21.210> easier<00:03:21.720> access<00:03:21.900> to<00:03:22.730> the

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
deal gives us easier access to the

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.390 
deal gives us easier access to the
muffler<00:03:24.330> which<00:03:24.630> now<00:03:25.500> that's<00:03:25.680> off<00:03:25.830> the<00:03:25.980> car<00:03:26.190> and

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
muffler which now that's off the car and

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.830 
muffler which now that's off the car and
off<00:03:26.490> the<00:03:26.640> muffler<00:03:26.910> we<00:03:27.150> can<00:03:27.300> probably<00:03:27.450> just<00:03:27.630> cut

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
off the muffler we can probably just cut

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.870 
off the muffler we can probably just cut
a<00:03:27.870> slit<00:03:28.110> down<00:03:28.170> it<00:03:28.530> split<00:03:29.130> it<00:03:29.250> off<00:03:29.370> get<00:03:29.610> it<00:03:29.670> off

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
a slit down it split it off get it off

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.170 
a slit down it split it off get it off
the<00:03:30.270> pike<00:03:31.010> so<00:03:32.010> what<00:03:32.280> I<00:03:32.310> have<00:03:32.459> now<00:03:32.610> is<00:03:32.640> two<00:03:32.910> jacks

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
the pike so what I have now is two jacks

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.390 
the pike so what I have now is two jacks
one<00:03:33.480> Jack<00:03:33.690> over<00:03:33.900> the<00:03:34.080> muffler<00:03:34.410> went<00:03:35.130> over<00:03:35.310> the

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
one Jack over the muffler went over the

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.770 
one Jack over the muffler went over the
exhaust<00:03:35.610> system<00:03:35.850> since<00:03:36.209> we<00:03:36.330> don't<00:03:36.480> want<00:03:36.600> it<00:03:36.690> to

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
exhaust system since we don't want it to

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:37.340 
exhaust system since we don't want it to
fall

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
fall

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.110 
fall
since<00:03:37.680> the<00:03:37.830> muffler<00:03:38.190> at<00:03:38.310> the<00:03:38.430> back<00:03:38.580> holds<00:03:39.000> the

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
since the muffler at the back holds the

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.600 
since the muffler at the back holds the
whole<00:03:39.240> system<00:03:39.540> up<00:03:39.690> pretty<00:03:40.020> much<00:03:40.310> so<00:03:41.310> now<00:03:41.430> I<00:03:41.459> can

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
whole system up pretty much so now I can

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.740 
whole system up pretty much so now I can
come<00:03:41.790> in<00:03:42.410> cut<00:03:43.410> this<00:03:43.530> pipe<00:03:44.090> right<00:03:45.090> here<00:03:45.360> with<00:03:45.600> my

old<00:03:53.880> muffler<00:03:54.860> my<00:03:55.860> crack<00:03:56.100> is<00:03:56.310> obviously

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
old muffler my crack is obviously

old muffler my crack is obviously
migrated<00:03:57.980> over

plus<00:03:59.370> it<00:03:59.520> has<00:03:59.610> a<00:03:59.670> rust<00:03:59.940> hole<00:04:00.150> there<00:04:01.070> it's<00:04:02.070> all

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
plus it has a rust hole there it's all

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.970 
plus it has a rust hole there it's all
rusted<00:04:02.610> along<00:04:02.850> that<00:04:03.030> seam<00:04:03.239> there<00:04:03.980> otherwise

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
rusted along that seam there otherwise

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.290 
rusted along that seam there otherwise
it<00:04:05.130> looks<00:04:05.160> good<00:04:05.630> but<00:04:06.630> it<00:04:06.840> was<00:04:06.959> a<00:04:06.989> flap<00:04:07.260> that<00:04:08.300> was

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300 
it looks good but it was a flap that was

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.900 
it looks good but it was a flap that was
so<00:04:09.480> bad<00:04:12.739> you<00:04:13.739> can<00:04:13.920> see<00:04:14.100> where<00:04:14.280> the<00:04:14.610> number<00:04:14.850> is

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
so bad you can see where the number is

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.860 
so bad you can see where the number is
etched<00:04:15.120> into<00:04:15.390> thee<00:04:16.970> but<00:04:17.970> that's<00:04:18.390> one<00:04:18.720> reason

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
etched into thee but that's one reason

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.650 
etched into thee but that's one reason
why<00:04:19.109> my<00:04:19.729> screws<00:04:20.729> in<00:04:20.880> working<00:04:21.269> honestly<00:04:21.540> they

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
why my screws in working honestly they

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.630 
why my screws in working honestly they
need<00:04:21.810> to<00:04:21.930> be<00:04:22.019> longer<00:04:22.310> because<00:04:23.310> it<00:04:23.430> looks<00:04:23.580> like

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
need to be longer because it looks like

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.320 
need to be longer because it looks like
this<00:04:23.850> chamber<00:04:24.270> is<00:04:24.330> fine<00:04:25.040> that<00:04:26.040> this<00:04:26.940> crack<00:04:27.150> was

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
this chamber is fine that this crack was

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.530 
this chamber is fine that this crack was
just<00:04:27.479> so<00:04:27.570> flat<00:04:27.840> be<00:04:28.070> arrested<00:04:29.070> so<00:04:30.000> that's<00:04:30.390> why

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
just so flat be arrested so that's why

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.210 
just so flat be arrested so that's why
we're<00:04:30.690> getting<00:04:30.870> rid<00:04:30.990> of<00:04:31.050> it<00:04:31.169> putting<00:04:31.890> on<00:04:31.979> a<00:04:32.010> new

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
we're getting rid of it putting on a new

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.060 
we're getting rid of it putting on a new
one<00:04:32.870> installing<00:04:33.870> is<00:04:34.229> now<00:04:34.440> really<00:04:34.800> easy

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
one installing is now really easy

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.770 
one installing is now really easy
because<00:04:35.370> we're<00:04:35.700> dealing<00:04:35.850> with<00:04:36.090> new<00:04:36.390> parts

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
because we're dealing with new parts

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.050 
because we're dealing with new parts

I've<00:04:40.770> done<00:04:40.950> on<00:04:41.010> the<00:04:41.220> pipe<00:04:41.430> here<00:04:41.669> is<00:04:41.700> I've

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
I've done on the pipe here is I've

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.090 
I've done on the pipe here is I've
marked<00:04:42.180> a<00:04:42.419> half<00:04:42.990> an<00:04:43.200> inch<00:04:43.290> an<00:04:43.560> inch<00:04:43.710> and<00:04:44.010> an

inch and a half guys our little

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.719 
inch and a half guys our little
extension<00:04:46.350> coming<00:04:46.620> out<00:04:46.770> of<00:04:46.919> the<00:04:46.979> muffler<00:04:47.250> is<00:04:47.490> 2

extension coming out of the muffler is 2
inches<00:04:47.940> long<00:04:48.330> we<00:04:48.900> want<00:04:49.140> our<00:04:49.260> clamp<00:04:49.560> about<00:04:50.550> in

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
inches long we want our clamp about in

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.340 
inches long we want our clamp about in
the<00:04:50.850> middle<00:04:51.030> but<00:04:51.270> we<00:04:51.419> want<00:04:51.600> some<00:04:51.840> space<00:04:52.140> to

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
the middle but we want some space to

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:53.840 
the middle but we want some space to
also<00:04:52.590> be<00:04:52.710> able<00:04:52.800> to<00:04:52.919> cut<00:04:53.130> this<00:04:53.250> thing<00:04:53.490> off<00:04:53.640> when

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
also be able to cut this thing off when

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:58.040 
also be able to cut this thing off when
it<00:04:53.940> rots<00:04:54.180> out<00:04:54.390> so<00:04:55.790> it<00:04:56.790> should<00:04:57.120> as<00:04:57.390> long<00:04:57.810> as<00:04:57.930> your

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
it rots out so it should as long as your

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:59.600 
it rots out so it should as long as your
pipes<00:04:58.260> relatively<00:04:58.650> round<00:04:58.860> you<00:04:59.100> may<00:04:59.250> need<00:04:59.430> to

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
pipes relatively round you may need to

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.370 
pipes relatively round you may need to
round<00:04:59.820> it<00:05:00.060> because<00:05:00.750> sometimes<00:05:01.140> when<00:05:01.350> people

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
round it because sometimes when people

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.170 
round it because sometimes when people
put<00:05:01.740> muffler<00:05:02.070> clamps<00:05:02.370> on<00:05:02.490> they<00:05:02.640> squeeze<00:05:02.970> them

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
put muffler clamps on they squeeze them

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.450 
put muffler clamps on they squeeze them
till<00:05:03.390> they're<00:05:03.830> infinitely<00:05:04.830> tight<00:05:05.220> and<00:05:05.340> that's

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
till they're infinitely tight and that's

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.820 
till they're infinitely tight and that's
no<00:05:05.610> good<00:05:05.810> you<00:05:06.810> just<00:05:06.840> need<00:05:07.200> it<00:05:07.229> for<00:05:07.350> it<00:05:07.530> to<00:05:07.620> seal

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
no good you just need it for it to seal

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.400 
no good you just need it for it to seal
but<00:05:08.040> what<00:05:08.190> we'll<00:05:08.340> do<00:05:08.460> is<00:05:08.580> we'll<00:05:08.640> put<00:05:08.820> it<00:05:08.910> on<00:05:09.410> it

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
but what we'll do is we'll put it on it

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:11.900 
but what we'll do is we'll put it on it
fits<00:05:10.650> over<00:05:10.770> I'm<00:05:11.100> gonna<00:05:11.280> put<00:05:11.460> this<00:05:11.580> side<00:05:11.760> on

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
fits over I'm gonna put this side on

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.830 
fits over I'm gonna put this side on
first<00:05:12.210> because<00:05:12.390> it's<00:05:12.720> more<00:05:12.870> Wiggly<00:05:13.200> and<00:05:14.840> I'm

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
first because it's more Wiggly and I'm

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.140 
first because it's more Wiggly and I'm
gonna<00:05:16.020> shoot<00:05:16.229> for<00:05:16.440> an<00:05:16.500> inch<00:05:16.620> and<00:05:16.740> a<00:05:16.770> half<00:05:17.150> and

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
gonna shoot for an inch and a half and

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.909 
gonna shoot for an inch and a half and
what<00:05:18.720> that<00:05:18.900> does<00:05:19.050> for<00:05:19.110> me<00:05:19.500> is<00:05:20.030> it<00:05:21.030> allows<00:05:21.300> my

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:21.919 
what that does for me is it allows my

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:25.760 
what that does for me is it allows my
muffler<00:05:22.919> clamp<00:05:23.340> my<00:05:23.700> exhaust<00:05:24.240> clamp<00:05:24.539> to<00:05:24.720> be

muffler clamp my exhaust clamp to be
about<00:05:26.220> in<00:05:26.370> the<00:05:26.400> middle<00:05:26.700> yet<00:05:27.390> still<00:05:27.600> have<00:05:27.750> that

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
about in the middle yet still have that

cutoff space that I'm looking for and

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.430 
cutoff space that I'm looking for and
once<00:05:29.970> that<00:05:30.120> sides<00:05:30.390> on<00:05:30.630> I'm<00:05:30.840> gonna<00:05:30.960> work<00:05:31.140> on<00:05:31.320> the

our two and a quarter inch in the pipe
clamp<00:05:48.090> down<00:05:48.330> really<00:05:48.570> tight<00:05:48.840> what<00:05:49.620> I<00:05:49.650> ended<00:05:49.980> up

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.070 
clamp down really tight what I ended up

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:52.700 
clamp down really tight what I ended up
doing<00:05:50.520> was<00:05:51.120> actually<00:05:51.510> putting<00:05:52.170> the<00:05:52.320> pipe<00:05:52.500> in

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:52.710 
doing was actually putting the pipe in

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.520 
doing was actually putting the pipe in
the<00:05:52.830> back<00:05:53.790> of<00:05:53.970> the<00:05:54.030> muffler<00:05:54.180> and<00:05:55.140> coming<00:05:55.410> in

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:55.530 
the back of the muffler and coming in

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:57.050 
the back of the muffler and coming in
here<00:05:55.830> and<00:05:56.010> aligning<00:05:56.400> everything<00:05:56.880> is<00:05:56.970> you

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.060 
here and aligning everything is you

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:58.580 
here and aligning everything is you
really<00:05:57.210> want<00:05:57.420> to<00:05:57.480> work<00:05:57.570> from<00:05:57.720> your<00:05:57.810> front<00:05:58.380> back

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:58.590 
really want to work from your front back

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.010 
really want to work from your front back
so<00:05:59.340> we<00:05:59.490> got<00:05:59.640> this<00:05:59.820> one<00:05:59.970> in<00:06:00.120> as<00:06:00.270> as<00:06:00.450> far<00:06:00.780> as<00:06:00.900> we

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.020 
so we got this one in as as far as we

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.490 
so we got this one in as as far as we
need<00:06:01.140> it<00:06:01.200> to

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 
need it to

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.410 
need it to
we<00:06:01.800> got<00:06:01.950> the<00:06:02.040> muffler<00:06:02.400> level<00:06:02.760> clamped<00:06:03.330> it

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:03.420 
we got the muffler level clamped it

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:06.520 
we got the muffler level clamped it
right<00:06:03.540> down<00:06:03.690> then<00:06:04.530> we<00:06:04.590> moved<00:06:04.710> out<00:06:04.860> back

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:06.530 
right down then we moved out back

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:09.710 
right down then we moved out back
installation<00:06:07.530> is<00:06:07.620> much<00:06:07.860> easier<00:06:08.340> than<00:06:08.720> taking

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:09.720 
installation is much easier than taking

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.960 
installation is much easier than taking
it<00:06:09.840> out<00:06:09.960> honestly<00:06:10.340> then<00:06:11.340> we<00:06:11.460> have<00:06:11.610> this<00:06:11.790> whole

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:11.970 
it out honestly then we have this whole

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:13.400 
it out honestly then we have this whole
mess<00:06:12.270> of<00:06:12.450> clamps<00:06:12.750> back<00:06:12.930> here<00:06:13.110> let<00:06:13.290> me<00:06:13.320> explain

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:13.410 
mess of clamps back here let me explain

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:17.750 
mess of clamps back here let me explain
it<00:06:14.900> it's<00:06:15.900> a<00:06:16.050> two<00:06:16.200> inch<00:06:16.380> outlet<00:06:16.740> so<00:06:17.070> we<00:06:17.430> have<00:06:17.580> our

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:17.760 
it it's a two inch outlet so we have our

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.030 
it it's a two inch outlet so we have our
two<00:06:17.970> inch<00:06:18.120> clamp<00:06:18.390> there<00:06:18.660> clam<00:06:19.170> to<00:06:19.320> our<00:06:19.380> pipe<00:06:19.620> we

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:20.040 
two inch clamp there clam to our pipe we

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.470 
two inch clamp there clam to our pipe we
had<00:06:20.130> to<00:06:20.250> make<00:06:20.400> sure<00:06:20.430> our<00:06:20.550> over<00:06:20.970> the<00:06:21.090> axle

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:21.480 
had to make sure our over the axle

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.940 
had to make sure our over the axle
exhaust<00:06:21.780> pipe<00:06:21.990> but<00:06:22.170> it<00:06:22.260> was<00:06:22.410> all<00:06:22.530> aligned

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:22.950 
exhaust pipe but it was all aligned

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:26.900 
exhaust pipe but it was all aligned
again<00:06:23.420> which<00:06:24.420> it<00:06:24.570> now<00:06:24.720> is<00:06:25.020> and<00:06:26.010> traditionally

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:26.910 
again which it now is and traditionally

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:29.300 
again which it now is and traditionally
and<00:06:27.060> I<00:06:27.120> don't<00:06:27.300> know<00:06:27.360> if<00:06:27.450> you<00:06:27.540> can<00:06:27.690> see<00:06:27.870> it<00:06:28.310> for

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:29.310 
and I don't know if you can see it for

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:30.790 
and I don't know if you can see it for
me<00:06:29.430> showing<00:06:29.640> you<00:06:29.850> or<00:06:30.000> not<00:06:30.120> but<00:06:30.180> the<00:06:30.540> other

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:30.800 
me showing you or not but the other

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.830 
me showing you or not but the other
muffler<00:06:31.820> on<00:06:32.820> the<00:06:32.910> other<00:06:33.060> side<00:06:33.270> has<00:06:33.480> two<00:06:33.660> piece

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:33.840 
muffler on the other side has two piece

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.630 
muffler on the other side has two piece
of<00:06:34.020> metal<00:06:34.260> that<00:06:34.290> come<00:06:34.530> out<00:06:34.650> into<00:06:35.220> these<00:06:35.340> rubber

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:35.640 
of metal that come out into these rubber

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:36.950 
of metal that come out into these rubber
supports<00:06:36.060> here<00:06:36.210> and<00:06:36.300> that's<00:06:36.420> what<00:06:36.540> holds<00:06:36.690> the

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 
supports here and that's what holds the

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.330 
supports here and that's what holds the
muffler<00:06:37.260> up<00:06:37.380> holds<00:06:37.650> the<00:06:37.710> rear<00:06:37.890> part<00:06:38.100> of<00:06:38.160> the

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:38.340 
muffler up holds the rear part of the

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:41.030 
muffler up holds the rear part of the
exhaust<00:06:39.120> and<00:06:39.420> like<00:06:39.630> I<00:06:39.720> said<00:06:39.780> the<00:06:40.710> old<00:06:40.860> one

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:41.040 
exhaust and like I said the old one

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.380 
exhaust and like I said the old one
broke<00:06:41.220> and<00:06:41.670> this<00:06:41.790> one<00:06:41.970> doesn't<00:06:42.120> even<00:06:42.210> have

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:42.390 
broke and this one doesn't even have

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:45.280 
broke and this one doesn't even have
them<00:06:42.870> so<00:06:43.020> I<00:06:43.050> have<00:06:43.230> to<00:06:43.320> reuse<00:06:43.620> my<00:06:43.650> clamp<00:06:44.070> I<00:06:44.250> broke

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:45.290 
them so I have to reuse my clamp I broke

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:48.290 
them so I have to reuse my clamp I broke
what<00:06:46.290> I<00:06:46.320> did<00:06:46.710> is<00:06:47.040> because<00:06:47.430> it<00:06:47.580> was<00:06:47.700> broken<00:06:48.120> I

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:48.300 
what I did is because it was broken I

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.480 
what I did is because it was broken I
can't<00:06:49.080> quite<00:06:49.320> just<00:06:49.590> clamp<00:06:49.950> it<00:06:50.070> back<00:06:50.220> on<00:06:50.400> the

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:50.490 
can't quite just clamp it back on the

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:51.950 
can't quite just clamp it back on the
exhaust<00:06:50.730> pipe<00:06:50.940> there's<00:06:51.120> too<00:06:51.210> much<00:06:51.330> give<00:06:51.660> and

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:51.960 
exhaust pipe there's too much give and

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.110 
exhaust pipe there's too much give and
I'd<00:06:52.650> also<00:06:52.860> bought<00:06:53.220> a<00:06:53.250> two<00:06:53.460> and<00:06:53.700> a<00:06:53.730> half<00:06:53.880> inch

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:54.120 
I'd also bought a two and a half inch

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.820 
I'd also bought a two and a half inch
muffler<00:06:54.480> clamp<00:06:54.690> so<00:06:55.230> that's<00:06:55.410> what's<00:06:55.680> holding

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:55.830 
muffler clamp so that's what's holding

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:57.500 
muffler clamp so that's what's holding
the<00:06:56.160> other<00:06:56.370> clamp<00:06:56.670> on<00:06:56.880> is<00:06:57.090> this<00:06:57.210> two<00:06:57.390> and<00:06:57.480> a

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:57.510 
the other clamp on is this two and a

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:59.780 
the other clamp on is this two and a
half<00:06:57.690> inch<00:06:57.960> is<00:06:58.470> holding<00:06:58.950> the<00:06:59.100> other<00:06:59.130> two-inch

00:06:59.780 --> 00:06:59.790 
half inch is holding the other two-inch

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:01.040 
half inch is holding the other two-inch
on<00:06:59.940> there<00:07:00.120> which<00:07:00.210> is<00:07:00.270> actually<00:07:00.630> holding<00:07:00.930> up

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:01.050 
on there which is actually holding up

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:03.530 
on there which is actually holding up
the<00:07:01.230> suspension<00:07:01.800> so<00:07:01.980> I<00:07:02.010> clamped<00:07:02.460> a<00:07:02.520> clamp<00:07:02.730> to

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:03.540 
the suspension so I clamped a clamp to

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:06.770 
the suspension so I clamped a clamp to
keep<00:07:03.660> the<00:07:03.810> exhaust<00:07:04.020> up<00:07:04.320> well<00:07:04.710> that's<00:07:04.800> it<00:07:05.780> also

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:06.780 
keep the exhaust up well that's it also

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:08.690 
keep the exhaust up well that's it also
to<00:07:06.960> car<00:07:07.200> down<00:07:07.410> I<00:07:07.440> don't<00:07:07.770> expect<00:07:08.040> any<00:07:08.310> problems

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:08.700 
to car down I don't expect any problems

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:10.430 
to car down I don't expect any problems
if<00:07:09.360> I<00:07:09.510> do<00:07:09.570> I'll<00:07:09.780> just<00:07:09.810> tighten<00:07:10.080> up<00:07:10.200> the<00:07:10.320> clamp

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:10.440 
if I do I'll just tighten up the clamp

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:11.480 
if I do I'll just tighten up the clamp
some<00:07:10.770> more<00:07:10.890> and<00:07:10.980> make<00:07:11.070> them<00:07:11.160> a<00:07:11.220> little<00:07:11.250> bit

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:11.490 
some more and make them a little bit

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:13.340 
some more and make them a little bit
tighter<00:07:11.700> that's<00:07:12.420> how<00:07:12.600> you<00:07:12.660> change<00:07:12.960> a<00:07:13.050> muffler

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:13.350 
tighter that's how you change a muffler

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:17.750 
tighter that's how you change a muffler
in<00:07:13.590> a<00:07:13.650> 1994<00:07:14.400> Chevy<00:07:14.670> Caprice<00:07:14.880> station<00:07:15.420> wagon
