hi everybody it's amazing to me how when
I'm<00:00:03.540> working<00:00:03.959> on<00:00:04.020> a<00:00:04.080> project

directions<00:00:24.260> recently<00:00:25.260> I<00:00:25.289> tried<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:26.279> make<00:00:27.000> my

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
directions recently I tried to make my

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.019 
directions recently I tried to make my
lawnmower<00:00:27.660> operate<00:00:28.590> on<00:00:28.800> vegetable<00:00:29.550> oil<00:00:29.699> which

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
lawnmower operate on vegetable oil which

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.450 
lawnmower operate on vegetable oil which
I<00:00:30.240> think<00:00:30.570> was<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.230> success<00:00:31.740> you<00:00:31.949> can<00:00:32.099> check<00:00:32.279> out

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
I think was a success you can check out

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.220 
I think was a success you can check out
that<00:00:32.669> video<00:00:32.880> right<00:00:33.660> here<00:00:33.899> if<00:00:34.050> you're<00:00:34.200> so

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
that video right here if you're so

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.250 
that video right here if you're so
inclined<00:00:34.670> however<00:00:35.670> I<00:00:36.030> started<00:00:36.690> thinking<00:00:36.989> wolf

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
inclined however I started thinking wolf

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.500 
inclined however I started thinking wolf
vegetable<00:00:37.980> oil<00:00:38.190> sure<00:00:38.489> is<00:00:38.640> stinky<00:00:38.940> when<00:00:39.239> I<00:00:39.270> heat

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
vegetable oil sure is stinky when I heat

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.240 
vegetable oil sure is stinky when I heat
it<00:00:39.540> up<00:00:39.690> what<00:00:39.870> about<00:00:39.960> hydrogen<00:00:40.260> hydrogen<00:00:40.890> just

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
it up what about hydrogen hydrogen just

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.220 
it up what about hydrogen hydrogen just
burns<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:41.910> water<00:00:42.210> is<00:00:42.390> created<00:00:42.840> it's<00:00:42.930> over<00:00:43.140> 2

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
burns and water is created it's over 2

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.020 
burns and water is created it's over 2
is<00:00:43.379> non-toxic<00:00:43.800> anyway<00:00:44.430> so<00:00:44.489> I<00:00:44.670> thought<00:00:44.850> well

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
is non-toxic anyway so I thought well

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.930 
is non-toxic anyway so I thought well
maybe<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.360> can<00:00:45.690> make<00:00:46.200> hydrogen<00:00:46.920> from<00:00:47.340> aluminum

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
maybe I can make hydrogen from aluminum

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.119 
maybe I can make hydrogen from aluminum
because<00:00:48.149> aluminum<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:49.020> very<00:00:49.379> reactive<00:00:49.590> I

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
because aluminum is very reactive I

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.900 
because aluminum is very reactive I
could<00:00:50.309> oxidize<00:00:50.910> it<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:52.520> liberate<00:00:53.520> hydrogen

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
could oxidize it and liberate hydrogen

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.729 
could oxidize it and liberate hydrogen
so<00:00:54.449> I<00:00:54.480> was<00:00:54.690> messing<00:00:54.899> around<00:00:55.050> with<00:00:55.289> some<00:00:55.530> molten

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
so I was messing around with some molten

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.560 
so I was messing around with some molten
aluminum<00:00:57.020> in<00:00:58.020> my<00:00:58.760> pan<00:00:59.760> here<00:01:00.180> in<00:01:00.359> the

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
aluminum in my pan here in the

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.670 
aluminum in my pan here in the
laboratory<00:01:00.859> and<00:01:01.859> I<00:01:02.850> didn't<00:01:03.840> have<00:01:04.260> any<00:01:04.439> real

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
laboratory and I didn't have any real

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.789 
laboratory and I didn't have any real
success<00:01:05.510> getting<00:01:06.510> hydrogen<00:01:07.170> but<00:01:07.380> at<00:01:07.560> any<00:01:07.710> rate

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
success getting hydrogen but at any rate

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.820 
success getting hydrogen but at any rate
I<00:01:08.250> did<00:01:08.610> notice<00:01:08.930> when<00:01:09.930> I<00:01:09.960> had<00:01:10.380> my<00:01:10.590> aluminum

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
I did notice when I had my aluminum

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.679 
I did notice when I had my aluminum
melted<00:01:11.460> in<00:01:11.580> this<00:01:11.729> pan<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.210> pan<00:01:12.240> was<00:01:12.510> really

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
melted in this pan the pan was really

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.420 
melted in this pan the pan was really
hot<00:01:12.900> because<00:01:13.049> Lumina<00:01:13.500> melts<00:01:13.799> at<00:01:13.950> 1,200

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
hot because Lumina melts at 1,200

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.120 
hot because Lumina melts at 1,200
degrees<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:15.030> I<00:01:15.360> sprayed<00:01:15.780> water<00:01:16.020> in<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.799> pan

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
degrees and I sprayed water in the pan

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.120 
degrees and I sprayed water in the pan
an<00:01:18.060> interesting<00:01:19.020> thing<00:01:19.229> happened<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.830> water

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
an interesting thing happened the water

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.460 
an interesting thing happened the water
did<00:01:20.460> not<00:01:20.490> all<00:01:21.200> evaporate

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
did not all evaporate

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.710 
did not all evaporate
there<00:01:22.740> were<00:01:22.950> little<00:01:23.189> droplets<00:01:23.939> inside<00:01:24.450> of<00:01:24.600> the

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
there were little droplets inside of the

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:31.670 
there were little droplets inside of the
pan<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:26.540> stayed<00:01:28.280> in<00:01:29.299> liquid<00:01:30.299> form<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:31.079> kind

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
pan that stayed in liquid form and kind

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.679 
pan that stayed in liquid form and kind
of<00:01:31.710> just<00:01:31.890> cruised<00:01:32.579> around<00:01:32.909> in<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.210> bottom<00:01:33.509> of

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
of just cruised around in the bottom of

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.600 
of just cruised around in the bottom of
the<00:01:34.049> pan<00:01:34.350> despite<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.920> fact<00:01:35.130> that<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.340> was<00:01:35.430> red

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
the pan despite the fact that it was red

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.569 
the pan despite the fact that it was red
hot<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.180> that<00:01:37.079> was<00:01:37.290> weird<00:01:37.560> I<00:01:37.829> thought<00:01:38.430> it

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
hot and that was weird I thought it

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.580 
hot and that was weird I thought it
might<00:01:38.729> have<00:01:38.850> been<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.210> witch<00:01:39.540> or<00:01:39.930> something

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
might have been a witch or something

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.889 
might have been a witch or something
well<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.130> turns<00:01:41.310> out<00:01:41.520> that's<00:01:42.150> just<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.659> little

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
well it turns out that's just a little

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.760 
well it turns out that's just a little
something<00:01:43.229> called<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:44.270> leaden<00:01:45.439> frost

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
something called the leaden frost

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.830 
something called the leaden frost
effect<00:01:48.049> Leidenfrost<00:01:49.049> effect<00:01:50.540> one<00:01:51.540> of<00:01:51.689> those

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
effect Leidenfrost effect one of those

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.679 
effect Leidenfrost effect one of those
is<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.200> right<00:01:52.229> pronunciation<00:01:53.030> and<00:01:54.030> it<00:01:54.299> was<00:01:54.420> so

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
is the right pronunciation and it was so

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.380 
is the right pronunciation and it was so
cool<00:01:55.200> that<00:01:55.619> I<00:01:56.219> thought<00:01:56.670> I<00:01:57.200> would<00:01:58.250> try<00:01:59.250> to

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
cool that I thought I would try to

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.850 
cool that I thought I would try to
duplicate<00:02:00.390> it<00:02:00.570> on<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:00.750> larger<00:02:01.229> surface<00:02:01.649> than

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
duplicate it on a larger surface than

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.429 
duplicate it on a larger surface than
the<00:02:01.950> pan<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:02.579> maybe<00:02:03.180> get<00:02:03.329> some<00:02:03.360> neat<00:02:03.689> visual

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
the pan and maybe get some neat visual

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.830 
the pan and maybe get some neat visual
effects<00:02:05.070> I<00:02:05.159> was<00:02:05.399> so<00:02:05.549> excited<00:02:05.880> in<00:02:06.210> fact<00:02:06.540> that

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
effects I was so excited in fact that

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.199 
effects I was so excited in fact that
today<00:02:07.140> we<00:02:07.170> went<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.710> thrift<00:02:07.950> shop<00:02:08.099> and<00:02:08.819> we

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
today we went to the thrift shop and we

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.020 
today we went to the thrift shop and we
bought<00:02:09.390> two<00:02:09.660> things<00:02:10.370> we<00:02:11.370> bought<00:02:11.550> this<00:02:11.730> cool
