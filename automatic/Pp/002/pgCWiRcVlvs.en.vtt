00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:06.580
 hi everyone as we first 

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:07.660
 found on the Video change 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.810
 hard disk of the ps4 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:14.280
 so that's all stupid 

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:17.680
 in fact just remove the part 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:22.330
 brilliant who is here so for that if I 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:26.820
 do not deceive you have to press a little and 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:31.499
 everything stopped 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:38.649
 so here is the brilliant part 

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:41.859
 then retains the part in question he 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:50.499
 a vi located right here to remove none 

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:52.710
 davis and that's because it imposes its 

00:00:50.499 --> 00:00:52.710
 view 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:05.420
 to be able to tender but the quality this 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:08.870
 which is my case what is going on in the running 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.870
 what we find 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.750
 that's pretty cool is that 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:16.720
 I do not know we'll see but on the 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:20.080
 life actually there go the logos of 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.750
 playstation one is so it's useless 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.910
 but here it is rather funny 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.190
 so then once it's divide 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:30.010
 we're back 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:32.080
 there we will find another four 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.940
 screw on the sides so on to juice from 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.790
 remove from hard drive then 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:39.820
 to install new and replace 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:42.610
 once this is done it is handed 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:46.900
 in there will be just one last 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:49.030
 thing to do it takes for it was going to get 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:52.440
 remakes the computer 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.250
 download the update will come back 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:58.990
 towards as I said just now 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:01.630
 so the 1.51 once it's done 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:06.610
 you create a folder well this 4 sa 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:09.009
 passion will see well here's create one of 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.230
 these four records interior pieces 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.890
 you create a folder called pub 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:17.170
 says and you just put the file 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.910
 kate was loaded inside that's it 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:23.620
 you put it all directly on the 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:26.800
 ration beyond the usb key is then and 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:30.850
 you'll need it to restart the 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:33.220
 ps4 and install just the famous 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.360
 laugh in question for the hard drive that 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.370
 him suddenly and blank 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.780
 so what am I going to do what I want 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.540
 to make the change here it is necessary that it 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.660
 it's done I'm going to relaunch the video 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:46.480
 is located immediately to the for 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.220
 installing sick of douala one gets 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.200
 find so I'll change the disc 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.810
 hard I put inside I have everything 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.400
 relocate internal console 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.140
 so we'll start now if I do not 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.650
 deceives not have to stay down for 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.510
 a few seconds on the button aune of 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.549
 the playstation 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.870
 that's what will put it in mode 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:07.720
 security 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:11.530
 So here we stay until supported astier 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:14.180
 that she is beeping again is there they me 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:19.730
 ask to plug in 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:23.010
 the ethernet / console controller 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.780
 lack of luck I will not go out in 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.090
 ethernet usb to the console lack of 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:32.939
 change is not out the usb cable or 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:58.500
 just a moment get it back in the 

00:03:32.939 --> 00:04:01.799
 box of a duck correctly in sense 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:11.209
 that it remains to fall in cash either 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:15.949
 not too wobbly here is the usb port 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:15.949
 I plug the joystick 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:28.700
 I shout one once that I see 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:31.940
 would be put a little more on the console 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:35.210
 I will make a real eh a real account 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:39.320
 rendering of what I think of the different 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:40.490
 functionality to and then that's how I 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.940
 was saying videos also at heart 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:47.140
 and I like it so here we go there 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:51.700
 what to do is go to 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:56.060
 number 7 so an issue to the pieces must 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:59.750
 to install the system of the 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:02.000
 success is just west done ok 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.310
 and here we have to wait here is the time 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.860
 that the station is done if I'm wrong 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.990
 not what I thought he understood 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:12.080
 take about five minutes so 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.910
 that's fast and then there after 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.880
 you start on a playstation 4 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:21.380
 we keep my work so with the menu of 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:24.140
 startup and that of course and then well 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:26.560
 sure it was necessary that it misses that 

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.560
 going there 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.060
 look 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.080
 we will revive 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.270
 here 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:51.030
 it may be because there are others 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:53.500
 shu according to the usb key 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:55.919
 in this case i 'm ready month and where he 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.919
 recommence 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:07.510
 the idea here we turn to this path 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.510
 the 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:13.260
 okay 

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:20.140
 I validate 6 weapons is an error I 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.370
 will start again I just finally play 

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:23.830
 pause time find 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:28.290
 the mistake and after day takes all of 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:28.290
 afterwards with the right solution here 

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:33.100
 this time to see what happens here 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:35.320
 an error on madoff 

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.550
 I will start this game just 

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.230
 pause and I take you back from 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:39.550
 Following the time everything was to 

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:42.040
 win but I found the solution 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:44.890
 finally rather problem it's all stupid 

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:45.880
 it was not the cap to day 

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:47.230
 does this attention when you 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.720
 get the update his site 

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:51.370
 internet the moon and there are two that we have 

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:54.700
 one two three are media that's for 

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:56.440
 an update precisely one of 800 

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.010
 media is for a new 

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.630
 installation 

00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:01.150
 so if you change your hard drive 

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:02.950
 take that of 800 media if you 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:04.360
 just keep the hard drive but 

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:06.220
 you want to recover the update 

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:08.560
 by internet recover that of three 

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:10.270
 300 mega cents that's it's no more 

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.830
 complicated that it's just this 

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:15.490
 was not the right update so 

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:18.340
 so I stopped at all sure that's me 

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:20.560
 behind I'm going to redo I'm going to do 

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:21.790
 my normal installation and then and then 

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:23.650
 we end up simply taking 

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:27.450
 next video i hope to show you the 

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:27.450
 remote play so that's it
