00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
so those are it there are basically

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.400 
so those are it there are basically
seven<00:03:44.739> shortcuts<00:03:45.220> that<00:03:45.430> we<00:03:45.579> went<00:03:45.819> through<00:03:46.150> and

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
seven shortcuts that we went through and

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.680 
seven shortcuts that we went through and
they<00:03:47.410> become<00:03:47.799> very<00:03:48.100> handy<00:03:48.670> and<00:03:48.880> very<00:03:49.150> useful

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
they become very handy and very useful

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.920 
they become very handy and very useful
during<00:03:49.959> a<00:03:50.290> actual<00:03:51.160> presentation<00:03:51.930> using

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
during a actual presentation using

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.129 
during a actual presentation using
PowerPoint<00:03:53.139> and<00:03:53.950> this<00:03:54.549> should<00:03:55.269> work<00:03:55.480> with<00:03:56.079> any

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:56.139 
PowerPoint and this should work with any

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:59.700 
PowerPoint and this should work with any
