through<00:01:11.610> this<00:01:11.909> thing<00:01:12.180> where<00:01:12.360> I<00:01:12.420> kind<00:01:12.780> of

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
through this thing where I kind of

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.320 
through this thing where I kind of
looked<00:01:13.170> at<00:01:13.260> things<00:01:13.530> again<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:15.140> reexamine<00:01:16.140> and

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
fully bought the spinning ball earth

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.380 
fully bought the spinning ball earth
with<00:01:54.240> gravity<00:01:54.780> holding<00:01:55.170> us<00:01:55.350> on<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.740> bottom

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
with gravity holding us on the bottom

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.340 
with gravity holding us on the bottom
idea<00:01:57.390> that<00:01:57.750> they<00:01:57.930> were<00:01:57.990> telling<00:01:58.619> us<00:01:58.860> at<00:01:59.040> school

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
idea that they were telling us at school

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.030 
idea that they were telling us at school
so<00:02:01.130> I<00:02:01.159> always<00:02:01.580> had<00:02:01.820> a<00:02:01.850> little<00:02:02.120> kind<00:02:02.690> of<00:02:03.040> inkling

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
so I always had a little kind of inkling

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.450 
so I always had a little kind of inkling
towards<00:02:05.030> this<00:02:05.659> not<00:02:05.990> being<00:02:06.320> the<00:02:07.010> way<00:02:07.159> they<00:02:07.340> told

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
towards this not being the way they told

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.790 
towards this not being the way they told
us<00:02:07.820> but<00:02:08.179> I<00:02:08.210> just<00:02:08.479> go<00:02:09.200> along<00:02:09.410> to<00:02:09.619> get<00:02:09.770> along

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
us but I just go along to get along

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.180 
us but I just go along to get along
through<00:02:10.310> schooling<00:02:11.050> and<00:02:12.050> then<00:02:12.260> in<00:02:12.410> my<00:02:12.560> 20s<00:02:12.980> I

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
through schooling and then in my 20s I

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.449 
through schooling and then in my 20s I
came<00:02:13.400> across<00:02:13.550> a<00:02:14.150> Geo<00:02:14.540> centricity<00:02:15.320> the<00:02:16.130> idea

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
came across a Geo centricity the idea

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.000 
came across a Geo centricity the idea
that<00:02:16.790> the<00:02:17.180> earth<00:02:17.209> is<00:02:17.600> the<00:02:17.780> center<00:02:17.959> of<00:02:18.410> the

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
that the earth is the center of the

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.620 
that the earth is the center of the
solar<00:02:19.130> system<00:02:19.700> or<00:02:19.730> the<00:02:19.940> earth<00:02:20.060> is<00:02:20.270> the<00:02:20.360> center

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
solar system or the earth is the center

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.440 
solar system or the earth is the center
of<00:02:20.690> the<00:02:20.840> universe<00:02:21.670> instead<00:02:22.670> of<00:02:22.760> the<00:02:22.910> Sun<00:02:23.150> the

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
of the universe instead of the Sun the

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.170

heliocentric<00:02:24.400> theory<00:02:25.400> that<00:02:25.670> they<00:02:25.820> teach<00:02:26.000> in

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
heliocentric theory that they teach in

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.330 
heliocentric theory that they teach in
school<00:02:26.510> and<00:02:27.350> that<00:02:27.530> was<00:02:27.650> making<00:02:27.860> quite<00:02:28.130> a<00:02:28.160> bit

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
school and that was making quite a bit

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.000 
school and that was making quite a bit
of<00:02:28.459> sense<00:02:28.700> and<00:02:29.060> then<00:02:29.510> from<00:02:29.750> there<00:02:29.930> I<00:02:30.010> started

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
of sense and then from there I started

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.430 
of sense and then from there I started
reading<00:02:31.310> some<00:02:31.340> old<00:02:31.640> Flat<00:02:32.120> Earth<00:02:32.150> books<00:02:32.630> most

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
reading some old Flat Earth books most

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.220 
reading some old Flat Earth books most
of<00:02:33.590> them<00:02:33.970> though<00:02:34.970> the<00:02:35.180> book<00:02:35.540> I<00:02:35.660> wrote<00:02:35.810> the<00:02:36.020> Flat

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
of them though the book I wrote the Flat

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.410 
of them though the book I wrote the Flat
Earth<00:02:36.260> conspiracy<00:02:37.160> it's<00:02:37.280> the<00:02:37.459> first<00:02:37.700> Flat

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
Earth conspiracy it's the first Flat

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.940 
Earth conspiracy it's the first Flat
Earth<00:02:38.450> book<00:02:38.900> that's<00:02:39.140> been<00:02:39.290> written<00:02:39.350> in<00:02:39.709> over

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
Earth book that's been written in over

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.420 
Earth book that's been written in over
40<00:02:40.280> years<00:02:40.540> before<00:02:41.540> that<00:02:42.010> most<00:02:43.010> of<00:02:43.190> them<00:02:43.310> were

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
40 years before that most of them were

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.650 
40 years before that most of them were
in<00:02:43.489> the<00:02:43.700> 1800s

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
in the 1800s

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.170 
in the 1800s
and<00:02:44.870> before<00:02:45.650> so<00:02:46.100> I<00:02:46.340> had<00:02:46.520> to<00:02:46.640> go<00:02:46.760> through<00:02:46.970> a<00:02:47.060> lot

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
and before so I had to go through a lot

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.260 
and before so I had to go through a lot
of<00:02:47.239> old<00:02:47.720> literature<00:02:48.020> and<00:02:49.060> having<00:02:50.060> gone

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
of old literature and having gone

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.660 
of old literature and having gone
through<00:02:50.330> quite<00:02:51.260> a<00:02:51.350> few<00:02:51.410> old<00:02:51.950> Flat<00:02:52.220> Earth<00:02:52.250> books

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
through quite a few old Flat Earth books

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.210 
through quite a few old Flat Earth books
that<00:02:52.910> really<00:02:53.180> started<00:02:53.570> to<00:02:53.780> dawn<00:02:54.620> on<00:02:54.680> me<00:02:54.830> that

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
that really started to dawn on me that

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.850 
that really started to dawn on me that
this<00:02:55.459> is<00:02:56.050> quite<00:02:57.050> a<00:02:57.110> conspiracy<00:02:58.810> and<00:02:59.810> legit<00:03:00.380> so

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
this is quite a conspiracy and legit so

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.630 
this is quite a conspiracy and legit so
yeah<00:03:01.310> it<00:03:01.550> took<00:03:01.730> me<00:03:01.910> years<00:03:02.150> of<00:03:03.310> going<00:03:04.310> back<00:03:04.489> and

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
yeah it took me years of going back and

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.270 
yeah it took me years of going back and
forth<00:03:04.910> for<00:03:05.180> this<00:03:05.360> this<00:03:05.720> was<00:03:05.930> this<00:03:06.769> for<00:03:07.040> real

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
forth for this this was this for real

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.400 
forth for this this was this for real
could<00:03:07.820> this<00:03:07.910> possibly<00:03:08.150> be<00:03:08.690> you<00:03:08.900> know<00:03:08.989> at<00:03:09.380> first

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
could this possibly be you know at first

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.259 
could this possibly be you know at first
did<00:03:09.920> you<00:03:10.070> think<00:03:10.310> that<00:03:10.580> you've<00:03:10.700> got<00:03:10.730> so<00:03:11.150> much

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
did you think that you've got so much

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:13.150 
did you think that you've got so much
proof<00:03:11.630> and<00:03:11.870> evidence<00:03:11.959> of<00:03:12.530> course<00:03:12.920> we're

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
proof and evidence of course we're

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.580 
proof and evidence of course we're
living<00:03:13.459> on<00:03:13.580> a<00:03:13.610> spinning<00:03:14.150> ball<00:03:14.360> and<00:03:14.840> NASA's

been to outer space and there's all

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.240 
been to outer space and there's all
these<00:03:17.329> other<00:03:17.510> ball<00:03:18.110> planets<00:03:18.650> and<00:03:18.860> everything

these other ball planets and everything

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.940 
these other ball planets and everything
the<00:03:20.120> whole<00:03:20.269> thing<00:03:20.510> seems<00:03:20.780> so<00:03:21.019> solid<00:03:21.530> at<00:03:21.650> first

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
the whole thing seems so solid at first

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.310 
the whole thing seems so solid at first
but<00:03:22.280> when<00:03:23.030> you<00:03:23.150> start<00:03:23.420> looking<00:03:23.570> into<00:03:24.079> the

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
but when you start looking into the

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:59.710 
but when you look into it more and more
and<00:03:57.560> if<00:03:57.920> you<00:03:58.010> got<00:03:58.130> the<00:03:58.489> ball<00:03:59.150> earth<00:03:59.360> in<00:03:59.600> your

the<00:04:02.390> more<00:04:02.600> you<00:04:02.690> look<00:04:02.840> into<00:04:02.989> the<00:04:03.260> evidence<00:04:03.680> for

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
the more you look into the evidence for

and against the more your your Flat
Earth<00:04:06.350> and<00:04:06.769> just<00:04:06.980> starts<00:04:07.310> being<00:04:07.670> weighed<00:04:07.910> down

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
Earth and just starts being weighed down

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.699 
Earth and just starts being weighed down

and the ball earth and starts being

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:10.809 
and the ball earth and starts being
lifted<00:04:09.949> up

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:10.819 
lifted up

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:13.119 
lifted up
and<00:04:11.060> you<00:04:11.180> say<00:04:11.390> that<00:04:11.659> there<00:04:12.110> really<00:04:12.200> is<00:04:12.590> no

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:13.129 
and you say that there really is no

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:15.339 
and you say that there really is no
evidence<00:04:13.459> whatsoever<00:04:13.930> that<00:04:14.930> we<00:04:15.049> are<00:04:15.109> living

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:15.349 
evidence whatsoever that we are living

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:18.490 
evidence whatsoever that we are living
on<00:04:15.650> a<00:04:15.709> spinning<00:04:16.250> ball<00:04:16.430> and<00:04:16.870> so<00:04:17.870> this<00:04:18.019> is<00:04:18.199> not<00:04:18.350> at

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
on a spinning ball and so this is not at

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.370 
on a spinning ball and so this is not at
all<00:04:18.560> anti<00:04:19.070> science<00:04:19.430> the<00:04:20.329> the<00:04:20.539> flat<00:04:20.810> motionless

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
all anti science the the flat motionless

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.909 
all anti science the the flat motionless

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:23.890 
earth
it's<00:04:22.280> very<00:04:22.580> pro<00:04:22.910> science<00:04:23.330> but<00:04:23.600> what<00:04:23.720> we've

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
it's very pro science but what we've

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.670 
it's very pro science but what we've
been<00:04:24.139> taught<00:04:24.440> is<00:04:24.919> a<00:04:25.160> pseudoscience<00:04:25.840> and<00:04:26.840> so

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
been taught is a pseudoscience and so

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:28.960 
been taught is a pseudoscience and so
that's<00:04:27.889> why<00:04:28.039> people<00:04:28.699> who've<00:04:28.850> been

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
that's why people who've been

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.779 
that's why people who've been
indoctrinated<00:04:29.270> into<00:04:29.900> the<00:04:30.139> pseudo<00:04:30.789> spinning

00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:31.789

indoctrinated into the pseudo spinning
ball<00:04:32.000> earth<00:04:32.180> science<00:04:32.750> look<00:04:33.530> at<00:04:33.770> this<00:04:34.280> new<00:04:34.490> Flat

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
ball earth science look at this new Flat

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.270 
ball earth science look at this new Flat
Earth<00:04:35.360> perspective<00:04:36.169> as<00:04:36.320> being<00:04:36.590> totally<00:04:36.949> anti

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
Earth perspective as being totally anti

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.640 
Earth perspective as being totally anti
science<00:04:37.729> as<00:04:37.940> you<00:04:37.970> said<00:04:38.300> but<00:04:38.960> the<00:04:39.410> more<00:04:39.560> you

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
science as you said but the more you

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:40.779 
science as you said but the more you
look<00:04:39.770> into<00:04:39.919> it<00:04:40.070> you'll<00:04:40.280> see<00:04:40.430> that<00:04:40.460> this<00:04:40.729> is

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:40.789 
look into it you'll see that this is

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:43.810 
look into it you'll see that this is
very<00:04:41.479> scientific<00:04:42.280> experiments<00:04:43.280> of<00:04:43.400> Fenton

and repeated calculations have been made

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.550 
and repeated calculations have been made
and<00:04:46.820> you<00:04:46.910> can<00:04:47.060> make<00:04:47.180> them<00:04:47.300> yourself<00:04:47.449> to<00:04:48.139> prove

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
and you can make them yourself to prove

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.050 
and you can make them yourself to prove
that<00:04:48.889> the<00:04:49.099> earth<00:04:49.250> doesn't<00:04:49.610> have<00:04:49.789> the

the Antarctic ice wall and it took them

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.159 
the Antarctic ice wall and it took them
years<00:05:12.880> three<00:05:13.880> or<00:05:13.970> four<00:05:14.180> years<00:05:14.570> to<00:05:14.690> go<00:05:14.930> all<00:05:15.020> the

back<00:06:33.600> to<00:06:33.840> Pythagoras<00:06:34.140> as<00:06:34.620> being<00:06:34.800> the<00:06:34.920> first

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:43.490 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:50.189 

you

00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:50.199 

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:55.170 

and<00:06:51.010> that<00:06:51.130> was<00:06:51.300> 2,500<00:06:52.300> years<00:06:52.480> ago<00:06:52.980> so<00:06:53.980> the<00:06:54.490> Sun

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:55.180 
and that was 2,500 years ago so the Sun

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:58.800 
and that was 2,500 years ago so the Sun
and<00:06:55.449> the<00:06:55.540> moon<00:06:55.860> revolve<00:06:56.860> over<00:06:57.729> and<00:06:58.120> around<00:06:58.479> the

00:06:58.800 --> 00:06:58.810 
and the moon revolve over and around the

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:02.310 
and the moon revolve over and around the
Flat<00:06:59.050> Earth<00:06:59.580> the<00:07:00.580> Suttons<00:07:00.970> path<00:07:01.210> starts<00:07:01.840> on

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:02.320 
Flat Earth the Suttons path starts on

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.730 
Flat Earth the Suttons path starts on
june<00:07:02.979> 21st<00:07:03.580> on<00:07:03.940> the<00:07:04.060> summer<00:07:04.300> solstice<00:07:04.560> at<00:07:05.560> the

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:05.740 
june 21st on the summer solstice at the

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:10.110 
june 21st on the summer solstice at the
Tropic<00:07:06.130> of<00:07:06.389> Cancer<00:07:07.389> at<00:07:08.050> 23.5<00:07:08.860> degrees<00:07:09.130> north

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:10.120 
Tropic of Cancer at 23.5 degrees north

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.689 
Tropic of Cancer at 23.5 degrees north
latitude<00:07:10.680> so<00:07:11.680> if<00:07:11.800> we're<00:07:11.949> looking<00:07:12.160> at<00:07:12.280> a<00:07:12.310> flat

00:07:12.689 --> 00:07:12.699 
latitude so if we're looking at a flat

00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:15.570 
latitude so if we're looking at a flat
model<00:07:13.120> here<00:07:13.419> the<00:07:13.990> North<00:07:14.229> Pole<00:07:14.590> is<00:07:14.949> the<00:07:15.280> middle

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:15.580 
model here the North Pole is the middle

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.940 
model here the North Pole is the middle
point
