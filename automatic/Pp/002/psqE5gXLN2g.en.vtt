00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.540
 good evening everyone is here with 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.950
 toni president of the marathon club 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.299
 torino who organized this 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.240
 wonderful evening bye tony 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.400
 bye bye then tell us a little how 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.090
 this idea is born and the realization of 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.119
 this event 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.160
 this idea and to prove it all 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.949
 that the people grate a compact people 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.349
 and above all to stay close to boys 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.480
 to make him understand what care means 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.010
 what does the marathon mean because it is not 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.079
 true sometimes we maybe do 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.610
 some serious error because we are 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.140
 human people too are wrong if 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.149
 tonight we are here with the team from 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.520
 let him understand the attachment we have 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.950
 that we have these in this team 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.090
 colors and we want to continue to 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.250
 we grow together with gold we know 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.379
 perfectly from the team that comes to 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.750
 three years of series b where he did 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.430
 very much to do this 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.640
 this category and we know 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.949
 perfectly that we also repeat 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.530
 we come from a dark period so many years 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.030
 in short, from now all I do 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.260
 we have to rebuild ourselves we want 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.909
 grow with them 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.470
 you want to grow with them you told me 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.360
 and so this is an evening that 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.549
 we can say a success we say from 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.350
 our part certainly yes and I repeat it 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.820
 again we want to prove players 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.439
 which are almost all new who do not know 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.780
 perhaps the importance of getting an idea of â€‹â€‹what 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.369
 it means playing a derby we don't want 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.320
 let him know we 're not always there 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.260
 for ninety minutes in the 90 minutes if 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.900
 we will always be regardless 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:35.540
 so we are also sometimes here too 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.580
 some whistle that someone is 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.190
 permission to do these things is not 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.590
 from the hard core of care that 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.690
 bartolo these things are left some 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.970
 challenge some players but what 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.560
 but it's definitely not a wanted thing 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.450
 from the curve and it's not a thing 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.570
 we want we don't want to be close to 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.240
 they are responsible for me today 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.400
 of the curve I can also say these things 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.640
 I don't want them, we always have to cheer 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:04.280
 bull and then to be clarified with the players i 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.750
 dirty ceramic cloths by itself when not 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.090
 there was never these marco problems again 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.460
 these misunderstandings therefore in short 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.230
 let's say that thanks to the marathon club 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.940
 the fans in some way yes 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.800
 get closer to the team after so many 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.300
 years at this time we can say it 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.430
 we want to be really close then 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.110
 because we want to give that push 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.310
 that push that bank at home because 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.440
 away from home but there are good things 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.270
 maybe at home maybe but we are missing 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.670
 just us and we want 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.930
 we want to prove that at home the 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.500
 twelfth and woke up of 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.500
 taxpayers
