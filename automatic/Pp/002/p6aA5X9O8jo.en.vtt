Springs we are in youth Valley Park a

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:25.200 
Springs we are in youth Valley Park a
mile<00:00:23.350> and<00:00:23.529> a<00:00:23.590> half<00:00:23.740> from<00:00:23.770> our<00:00:24.070> office<00:00:24.460> we've

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.210 
mile and a half from our office we've

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:26.970 
mile and a half from our office we've
been<00:00:25.420> developing<00:00:25.600> mountain<00:00:26.290> bike<00:00:26.470> wheels<00:00:26.650> for

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:26.980 
been developing mountain bike wheels for

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.429 
been developing mountain bike wheels for
over<00:00:27.340> four<00:00:27.790> years<00:00:28.090> in<00:00:28.480> this<00:00:28.720> location<00:00:29.260> and

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:29.439 
over four years in this location and

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:31.080 
over four years in this location and
we've<00:00:29.920> learned<00:00:30.189> a<00:00:30.250> lot<00:00:30.400> throughout<00:00:30.849> these

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.090 
we've learned a lot throughout these

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.330 
we've learned a lot throughout these
developments<00:00:31.840> however<00:00:32.410> one<00:00:32.950> thing<00:00:33.160> we're

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.340 
developments however one thing we're

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.490 
developments however one thing we're
convinced<00:00:33.850> of<00:00:34.000> is<00:00:34.180> a<00:00:34.420> good<00:00:34.930> mountain<00:00:35.350> bike

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:35.500 
convinced of is a good mountain bike

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.729 
convinced of is a good mountain bike
wheel<00:00:35.710> has<00:00:36.190> to<00:00:36.370> be<00:00:36.489> balanced<00:00:37.110> yes<00:00:38.110> we<00:00:38.379> did<00:00:38.530> many

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:38.739 
wheel has to be balanced yes we did many

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:40.380 
wheel has to be balanced yes we did many
tests<00:00:39.100> at<00:00:39.309> the<00:00:39.430> at<00:00:39.670> the<00:00:39.760> beginning<00:00:40.150> of<00:00:40.239> the

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.390 
tests at the at the beginning of the

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.780 
tests at the at the beginning of the
year<00:00:40.629> we<00:00:41.199> tried<00:00:41.470> the<00:00:41.590> different<00:00:41.710> rims<00:00:42.220> we

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
year we tried the different rims we

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:48.030 
year we tried the different rims we
mainly<00:00:43.629> try<00:00:43.900> also<00:00:44.320> ups<00:00:45.220> and<00:00:45.960> spokes<00:00:47.040> thickness

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.040 
mainly try also ups and spokes thickness

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.290 
mainly try also ups and spokes thickness
spoke<00:00:48.820> tension<00:00:49.830> so<00:00:50.830> it<00:00:50.979> was<00:00:51.129> a<00:00:51.300> really

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
spoke tension so it was a really

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.939 
spoke tension so it was a really
interesting<00:00:52.479> it<00:00:52.870> is<00:00:52.960> not<00:00:53.199> easy<00:00:53.379> with<00:00:53.620> the<00:00:53.769> will

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:53.949 
interesting it is not easy with the will

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:58.500 
interesting it is not easy with the will
you<00:00:54.940> really<00:00:55.690> have<00:00:55.960> to<00:00:56.199> stay<00:00:57.100> focused<00:00:57.309> and<00:00:57.820> you

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
you really have to stay focused and you

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.329 
you really have to stay focused and you
need<00:00:58.659> to<00:00:58.809> have<00:00:58.900> perfectly<00:00:59.409> the<00:00:59.710> same<00:00:59.739> tire<00:01:00.129> and

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:00.339 
need to have perfectly the same tire and

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:03.750 
need to have perfectly the same tire and
pressure<00:01:00.610> and<00:01:00.970> and<00:01:01.809> do<00:01:02.620> exactly<00:01:03.100> the<00:01:03.280> same<00:01:03.309> lab

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
pressure and and do exactly the same lab

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.690 
pressure and and do exactly the same lab
and<00:01:04.059> it's<00:01:04.900> super<00:01:05.290> interesting<00:01:05.530> and<00:01:06.130> it's

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
and it's super interesting and it's

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.910 
and it's super interesting and it's
amazing<00:01:07.180> the<00:01:07.210> difference<00:01:07.659> you<00:01:07.750> can<00:01:07.930> find<00:01:08.229> yeah

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
amazing the difference you can find yeah

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.830 
amazing the difference you can find yeah
at<00:01:09.100> the<00:01:09.220> moment<00:01:09.369> I<00:01:09.640> mainly<00:01:09.909> focus<00:01:10.090> on<00:01:10.659> the

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
at the moment I mainly focus on the

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:11.880 
at the moment I mainly focus on the
Android<00:01:11.229> races

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
Android races

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.850 
Android races
so<00:01:12.340> what's<00:01:12.700> arrays<00:01:13.119> and<00:01:13.540> the<00:01:14.110> wrong<00:01:14.320> 50<00:01:14.770> is

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
so what's arrays and the wrong 50 is

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.890 
so what's arrays and the wrong 50 is
really<00:01:15.130> good<00:01:15.310> for<00:01:15.490> that<00:01:15.670> because<00:01:15.909> it's<00:01:16.330> light

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
really good for that because it's light

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.300 
really good for that because it's light
and<00:01:17.350> strong<00:01:18.100> and<00:01:18.869> so<00:01:19.869> we<00:01:20.260> have<00:01:20.380> a<00:01:20.409> good<00:01:21.100> balance

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
and strong and so we have a good balance

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.789 
and strong and so we have a good balance
between<00:01:21.580> the<00:01:21.969> stiffness<00:01:22.659> and<00:01:22.930> make<00:01:23.289> something

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:23.799 
between the stiffness and make something

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:26.940 
between the stiffness and make something
a<00:01:24.039> bit<00:01:24.390> comfortable<00:01:25.390> and<00:01:25.630> soft<00:01:25.869> radar<00:01:26.680> really

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
a bit comfortable and soft radar really

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.270 
a bit comfortable and soft radar really
strong<00:01:27.430> it's<00:01:27.700> a<00:01:27.880> ring<00:01:28.299> and<00:01:28.600> the<00:01:29.229> wrong<00:01:29.500> 60<00:01:30.070> is<00:01:30.130> a

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
strong it's a ring and the wrong 60 is a

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.819 
strong it's a ring and the wrong 60 is a
carbon<00:01:30.820> one<00:01:31.060> so<00:01:31.719> you<00:01:31.780> can<00:01:32.020> really<00:01:32.350> feel<00:01:32.649> the

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:32.829 
carbon one so you can really feel the

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:34.679 
carbon one so you can really feel the
difference<00:01:32.859> when<00:01:33.520> you<00:01:33.579> are<00:01:33.850> made<00:01:34.570> an

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:34.689 
difference when you are made an

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:39.440 
difference when you are made an
acceleration<00:01:35.640> it's<00:01:36.640> it's<00:01:36.969> great<00:01:37.210> great<00:01:37.659> rim

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
acceleration it's it's great great rim

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.690 
acceleration it's it's great great rim
so<00:01:40.450> in<00:01:40.539> order<00:01:40.659> to<00:01:40.840> achieve<00:01:41.350> the<00:01:42.280> really

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
so in order to achieve the really

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.609 
so in order to achieve the really
optimized<00:01:43.149> design<00:01:43.390> we've<00:01:44.109> done<00:01:44.350> a<00:01:44.380> lot<00:01:44.590> of

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
optimized design we've done a lot of

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:47.160 
optimized design we've done a lot of
work<00:01:44.890> here<00:01:45.250> on<00:01:45.429> the<00:01:45.549> computer<00:01:46.000> with<00:01:46.509> stress

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
work here on the computer with stress

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.109 
work here on the computer with stress
analysis<00:01:47.770> we<00:01:48.219> want<00:01:48.369> to<00:01:48.490> make<00:01:48.640> sure<00:01:48.670> that<00:01:48.939> these

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
analysis we want to make sure that these

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:51.300 
analysis we want to make sure that these
rims<00:01:49.570> are<00:01:49.840> strong<00:01:50.289> enough<00:01:50.560> to<00:01:51.159> withstand

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
rims are strong enough to withstand

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.190 
rims are strong enough to withstand
those<00:01:51.759> rock<00:01:51.969> hits<00:01:52.240> but<00:01:52.479> light<00:01:52.689> enough<00:01:52.719> that

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
those rock hits but light enough that

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.230 
those rock hits but light enough that
you<00:01:53.289> actually<00:01:53.499> want<00:01:53.979> to<00:01:54.070> ride<00:01:54.219> them<00:01:54.399> so<00:01:54.880> every

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
you actually want to ride them so every

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.510 
you actually want to ride them so every
bit<00:01:55.420> of<00:01:55.450> this<00:01:55.630> rim<00:01:55.929> has<00:01:56.079> been<00:01:56.229> scrutinized<00:01:56.530> to

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
bit of this rim has been scrutinized to

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.149 
bit of this rim has been scrutinized to
shut<00:01:57.999> out<00:01:58.149> as<00:01:58.329> much<00:01:58.600> material<00:01:59.140> as<00:01:59.259> possible<00:01:59.320> so

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
shut out as much material as possible so

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:01.800 
shut out as much material as possible so
this<00:02:00.310> means<00:02:00.579> not<00:02:00.819> only<00:02:01.149> do<00:02:01.240> we<00:02:01.329> want<00:02:01.359> a<00:02:01.630> lot<00:02:01.780> of

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
this means not only do we want a lot of

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.020 
this means not only do we want a lot of
material<00:02:02.289> in<00:02:02.380> the<00:02:02.499> hooks<00:02:02.770> but<00:02:03.549> we<00:02:03.759> have<00:02:03.880> to

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
material in the hooks but we have to

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.389 
material in the hooks but we have to
blend<00:02:04.390> that<00:02:04.780> material<00:02:05.710> down<00:02:05.920> into<00:02:06.280> the

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 
blend that material down into the

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:09.120 
blend that material down into the
sidewall<00:02:06.909> to<00:02:07.119> support<00:02:07.569> those<00:02:07.810> beads<00:02:08.200> another

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
sidewall to support those beads another

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.680 
sidewall to support those beads another
design<00:02:09.610> element<00:02:10.060> that<00:02:10.179> we've<00:02:10.330> worked<00:02:10.509> hard

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
design element that we've worked hard

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.170 
design element that we've worked hard
with<00:02:11.020> is<00:02:11.319> trying<00:02:11.620> to<00:02:11.710> optimize<00:02:12.250> how<00:02:12.760> the<00:02:12.819> tire

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
with is trying to optimize how the tire

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.660 
with is trying to optimize how the tire
fits<00:02:13.540> on<00:02:13.690> the<00:02:13.840> rim<00:02:14.080> and<00:02:14.350> so<00:02:14.950> we've<00:02:15.220> gone<00:02:15.430> and

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
fits on the rim and so we've gone and

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.390 
fits on the rim and so we've gone and
created<00:02:16.120> was<00:02:16.330> wide<00:02:16.960> angle<00:02:17.410> and<00:02:17.590> it<00:02:17.860> helps<00:02:18.190> give

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
created was wide angle and it helps give

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.850 
created was wide angle and it helps give
the<00:02:18.610> tire<00:02:18.910> more<00:02:19.270> support<00:02:19.840> so<00:02:20.319> you<00:02:20.350> can<00:02:20.440> run<00:02:20.680> a

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
the tire more support so you can run a

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.040 
the tire more support so you can run a
little<00:02:21.190> bit<00:02:21.370> lower<00:02:21.550> air<00:02:21.790> pressure<00:02:21.819> and<00:02:22.690> really

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
little bit lower air pressure and really

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.420 
little bit lower air pressure and really
get<00:02:23.200> into<00:02:23.410> the<00:02:23.530> corners<00:02:23.920> and<00:02:23.950> you<00:02:24.130> don't<00:02:24.310> have

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
get into the corners and you don't have

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.460 
get into the corners and you don't have
to<00:02:24.580> worry<00:02:24.760> about<00:02:24.910> your<00:02:25.120> tire<00:02:25.360> flopping<00:02:26.319> off

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
to worry about your tire flopping off

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.940 
to worry about your tire flopping off
the<00:02:26.650> rim

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
the rim

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.490 
the rim
and<00:02:27.040> this<00:02:27.670> is<00:02:27.819> with<00:02:28.000> standard<00:02:28.629> rim<00:02:28.870> standard

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
and this is with standard rim standard

and this is with standard rim standard
nipples<00:02:29.860> standard<00:02:30.250> spokes<00:02:30.610> but<00:02:31.209> it<00:02:31.390> comes

so<00:02:34.090> you<00:02:34.450> can<00:02:34.599> just<00:02:34.750> put<00:02:34.930> your<00:02:34.959> tires<00:02:35.230> on<00:02:35.560> and<00:02:35.769> go

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
so you can just put your tires on and go

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.490 
so you can just put your tires on and go
