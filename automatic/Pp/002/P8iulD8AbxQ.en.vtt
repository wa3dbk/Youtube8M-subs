00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:10.109
 It is Asada who gets a seat this year 

00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:11.350
 This time 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:12.659
 It is an ad lib 

00:00:12.659 --> 00:00:15.469
 There is also a press 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:18.960
 You can enter pet nicks 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.189
 I would like to practice the basic phrases of the old nest 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.650
 In the film, the pocket of legalism philosophy which did not go down first 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.970
 Because there was a communist side, 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.529
 Please dumb 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.470
 Lol 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.190
 Ad lib but 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.080
 Of course I'm doing a little bit so please ask 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.080
 Please give me 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.500
 Such 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.219
 But also this summer 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:02.500
 Especially softening 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.960
 There is no storyboarding and I am not listening to it 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.350
 I am ever 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.729
 Perform improvisation by combining the phrases you have practiced 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.020
 Did 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.150
 Really before improvisation 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.150
 I'm talking about what I'm playing 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.340
 Uh 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.979
 Eco ad lib 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:24.299
 I'm thinking I want to do my best 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.030
 I don't think I don't know how to do it at all 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.360
 You 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.360
 For example, it has become more than $ 10,000 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.470
 The man I remembered 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.470
 Which baby you are told 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.920
 It is said that you are looking first 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.189
 Keep in correlation with the memory and the solution 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.730
 In combination 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.330
 I will be able to talk 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.170
 It was a good flow but 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.170
 If it is to some extent it is the same 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.180
 It is already north of the word in the four corners 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.560
 Phrase 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.770
 Replaced but remember the phrase 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.710
 Yeah it's a combination that doesn't combine bullets 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.570
 Becomes able to raise 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.389
 It is disgusting 

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:10.599
 LOL 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:11.999
 In this Japanese language 

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:15.249
 I think there is a movement to ask Aiueoka 

00:02:15.249 --> 00:02:16.509
 But 

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:18.760
 There is still the next thing 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.049
 In the case of music 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:23.329
 I will put it on 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:26.109
 Soaring in the scale 

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:27.519
 On the other hand 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:29.209
 Check variously 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.209
 I was on the verge but there is no doubt 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:34.779
 Match 

00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:36.019
 Before 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:38.889
 At first it is nick that it is minor to a representative thing 

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:40.099
 Will be 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:42.290
 It is the first in fa but 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.290
 Position it as public 

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:50.389
 With a break 

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:55.969
 To 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:03.330
 It's like this I speak in Japanese like a sore ulcer 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.329
 Mo girl 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:09.389
 Various combinations of this to reach Nakajima 

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:11.869
 Important combination 

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:15.309
 Because many people who had led the way of arrangement also wrote in various ways 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:19.839
 I will make various phrase words 

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:21.659
 This in rice 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:22.909
 In particular 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:26.799
 The basics of the Abe Takimoto-cho between the Abe administrations 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:28.389
 Because it becomes 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:31.949
 Every day until bio-related 12 years 

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:35.049
 Please listen carefully little by little 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.930
 Phrases that correspond to the rice fields of speech 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.040
 Though 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.999
 Let's also remember the four phrases this time 

00:03:41.999 --> 00:03:43.969
 Phrase 11 first 

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:46.969
 It is such a thing 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:52.469
 take it easy 

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:55.469
 air 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:00.359
 Go out 

00:04:02.749 --> 00:04:05.749
 House 

00:04:06.399 --> 00:04:07.809
 It is this part 

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:10.349
 This is the same 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:11.330
 This is it 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.109
 Emiko mentions enum 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:15.020
 Colette 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.129
 sundaymorning 

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.930
 Human 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.049
 6. 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.049
 This song here 

00:04:23.559 --> 00:04:26.559
 with this 

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:29.590
 Luck will have no problem at all 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:30.949
 The wine is cool 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:33.069
 I think an example 

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:34.770
 I will do it again 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.770
 Ek 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:40.070
 Good work 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.070
 Next to the phrase 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.680
 Last 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.870
 If the north is late, you will get a niece. 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.270
 You 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:59.939
 From the bottom 

00:04:59.939 --> 00:05:02.759
 It is managed 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:05.849
 It corresponds to sem phrase 35 trillion but 

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:23.719
 The economy is generally above 

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:26.830
 I think it's good 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.210
 ru e 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.199
 Then 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:34.199
 Good luck that last 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:45.199
 It is said that 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:47.680
 I can not uraoji 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.680
 I went to the phrase pepsi 

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:54.589
 2nd case 

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:02.259
 operation 

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:05.259

 As for the odyssey too area next time 

00:06:13.369 --> 00:06:15.339
 Combine these phrases 

00:06:15.339 --> 00:06:17.219
 It is m12 novel 

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:19.740
 Many of the old nests don't talk 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:23.030
 As we think that we want to be governor, we account for these four first 

00:06:25.749 --> 00:06:26.749
