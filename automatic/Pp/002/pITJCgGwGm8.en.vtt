paper hold it like this you need a

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:40.880 
paper hold it like this you need a
scissor<00:00:25.010> cut<00:00:26.010> this<00:00:26.220> part<00:00:26.939> over<00:00:27.240> here<00:00:39.890> I'm

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
scissor cut this part over here I'm

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:54.520 
scissor cut this part over here I'm
gonna<00:00:41.250> do<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.489> race<00:00:41.820> let's<00:00:42.450> step<00:00:42.840> by<00:00:43.079> step<00:00:44.899> again

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.069 

and<00:00:55.530> again<00:00:55.949> you<00:00:56.309> need<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.489> fold<00:00:56.760> it<00:00:56.969> like<00:00:57.239> three

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
and again you need to fold it like three

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.590 
and again you need to fold it like three
times<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:58.800> wrinkle<00:00:59.160> or<00:00:59.250> wait<00:00:59.600> slowly

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
times and it wrinkle or wait slowly

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.899 
times and it wrinkle or wait slowly
here's<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.289> tricky<00:01:01.590> part<00:01:02.989> from<00:01:04.010> here<00:01:05.010> from

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
here's the tricky part from here from

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.109 
here's the tricky part from here from
this<00:01:06.210> point<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.930> take<00:01:07.680> this<00:01:08.189> point<00:01:08.549> over<00:01:09.090> here

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
this point to take this point over here

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:16.520 
this point to take this point over here
like<00:01:09.960> this<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:13.040> don't<00:01:14.040> want<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:15.200> this<00:01:16.200> point

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
like this I don't want it this point

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:23.929 
like this I don't want it this point
over<00:01:16.799> here<00:01:17.689> like<00:01:19.790> this<00:01:20.790> so<00:01:22.189> it's<00:01:23.189> gonna<00:01:23.340> be

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
over here like this so it's gonna be

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.210 
over here like this so it's gonna be
like<00:01:24.150> this<00:01:24.799> so<00:01:26.360> when<00:01:27.360> it's<00:01:27.509> like<00:01:27.720> this<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.979> cut

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
like this so when it's like this you cut

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.819 
like this so when it's like this you cut
this<00:01:29.460> part<00:01:29.729> just<00:01:30.299> put<00:01:30.540> this<00:01:30.750> much<00:01:31.020> cut<00:01:31.650> this

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
this part just put this much cut this

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:38.660 
this part just put this much cut this
part<00:01:32.040> I<00:01:32.509> guess<00:01:34.130> so<00:01:35.150> when<00:01:36.150> it's<00:01:36.360> now<00:01:36.720> just<00:01:37.670> cut

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
part I guess so when it's now just cut

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.030 
part I guess so when it's now just cut
it<00:01:38.820> like<00:01:39.060> this<00:01:42.020> so

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
it like this so

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:50.770 
it like this so
um<00:01:44.550> cut<00:01:45.300> it<00:01:45.450> like<00:01:45.840> this<00:01:46.580> make<00:01:47.580> like<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.990> circle

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
um cut it like this make like a circle

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.440 
um cut it like this make like a circle
like<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:52.160> circle<00:01:53.270> like<00:01:54.270> this<00:01:54.830> can<00:01:55.830> you<00:01:55.860> get<00:01:56.130> it

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
like a circle like this can you get it

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.040 
like a circle like this can you get it
it's<00:01:57.450> like<00:01:57.510> that

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
it's like that

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.760 

now<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.490> second<00:02:15.450> times<00:02:15.690> like<00:02:15.990> you<00:02:16.320> take<00:02:16.560> that

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
now the second times like you take that

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.570 
now the second times like you take that
out<00:02:17.120> now<00:02:18.120> it's<00:02:18.420> an<00:02:18.720> easy<00:02:19.170> simple<00:02:19.560> step<00:02:20.040> and
