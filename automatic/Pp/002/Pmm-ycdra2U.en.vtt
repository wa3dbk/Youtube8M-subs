00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.470
 probably heard 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.290
 so some new distractions from the 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.090
 Oscar style was actually not at all 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.310
 such a very spontaneous action it was 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.439
 actually a cent from samsung 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.380

 intense story that is needed at all 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.790
 I think from conversations I find myself there 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.830

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.979

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.090
 I don't have many words for it and it is 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.250
 a youtube magazine also doesn't have that much 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.880
 hear for say putin nobel prize 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.770

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.820
 from symphonica in rosso concert and she is 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.530
 completely done with all the fans here 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.630
 keep asking for the DVD 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.730
 she said on twitter for the last time 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.500
 there is no DVD 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.459
 so that they also have a nice day 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.080
 so what does it do 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.400

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.760

 it is a series of jerry jerry and beyond 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.989
 michael jackson are of course many 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.390
 Rumors have it that he is still a son 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.850
 and a DNA test has been done 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.920
 last showing just that there are 31 years 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.900
 howardard happened to be such a place of 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.730
 michael jackson where we should actually 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.690
 know nothing at all chapter nothing 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.610

 sheila care really weird by 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.750
 michael jackson is in my eyes 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:02.570
 a circle and if you don't want that 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:05.780
 he is your father and serge nest and like me 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.780

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.790
 it's my understanding you see father 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.080
 is now and then bad news for 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.400
 all youtube fans 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.900
 the men have previously said that 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.950
 they have been busy for a very long time 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.080
 a new album 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.490
 that would probably first in 2014 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.600
 happen to me 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.569
 when they say yes that is not possible 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:29.300
 maybe interest in fact 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:29.300

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.519

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.840
 these states are going to wear 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.950
 how they get used to it and whether they 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.950
