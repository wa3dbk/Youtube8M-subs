00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:44.819 
a standstill where I felt like the plot
was<00:01:42.969> going<00:01:43.359> in<00:01:43.539> sort<00:01:43.929> of<00:01:44.049> filler<00:01:44.289> arc<00:01:44.500> where<00:01:44.770> it

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:44.829 
was going in sort of filler arc where it

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:46.380 
was going in sort of filler arc where it
was<00:01:44.920> like<00:01:45.009> I<00:01:45.219> will<00:01:45.490> just<00:01:45.609> do<00:01:45.759> this<00:01:45.939> just<00:01:46.299> to

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
was like I will just do this just to

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:47.639 
was like I will just do this just to
fill<00:01:46.539> in<00:01:46.659> more<00:01:46.780> time<00:01:47.020> in<00:01:47.170> the<00:01:47.229> book<00:01:47.380> i<00:01:47.500> thought

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649 
fill in more time in the book i thought

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:49.529 
fill in more time in the book i thought
was<00:01:47.799> all<00:01:47.950> it<00:01:48.429> was<00:01:48.460> all<00:01:48.640> perfectly<00:01:48.820> planned<00:01:49.359> out

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:49.539 
was all it was all perfectly planned out

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:51.719 
was all it was all perfectly planned out
and<00:01:49.780> the<00:01:49.840> way<00:01:49.960> the<00:01:50.259> entire<00:01:50.380> plot<00:01:50.890> advanced<00:01:51.549> her

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
and the way the entire plot advanced her

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:53.730 
and the way the entire plot advanced her
out<00:01:51.880> I<00:01:52.119> just<00:01:52.539> thought<00:01:52.689> was<00:01:52.929> spot<00:01:53.289> on<00:01:53.320> the

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
out I just thought was spot on the

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.770 
out I just thought was spot on the
writing<00:01:54.100> in<00:01:54.219> this<00:01:54.340> book<00:01:54.549> is<00:01:54.729> also<00:01:55.090> great<00:01:55.359> I<00:01:55.539> was

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
writing in this book is also great I was

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.749 
writing in this book is also great I was
a<00:01:55.810> little<00:01:56.079> hesitant<00:01:56.289> at<00:01:56.740> first<00:01:56.770> because<00:01:57.310> when

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
a little hesitant at first because when

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.060 
a little hesitant at first because when
you<00:01:57.909> have<00:01:58.179> like<00:01:58.390> older<00:01:58.960> settings<00:01:59.649> in<00:01:59.859> books

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
you have like older settings in books

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.559 
you have like older settings in books
typically<00:02:00.549> you'll<00:02:00.789> get<00:02:00.969> thrown<00:02:01.240> with<00:02:01.450> all

00:02:01.559 --> 00:02:01.569 
typically you'll get thrown with all

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:03.059 
typically you'll get thrown with all
this<00:02:01.689> old<00:02:01.869> english<00:02:02.229> language<00:02:02.649> but<00:02:02.859> he<00:02:02.920> wasn't

00:02:03.059 --> 00:02:03.069 
this old english language but he wasn't

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:05.039 
this old english language but he wasn't
used<00:02:03.399> too<00:02:03.640> much<00:02:03.789> why<00:02:04.030> did<00:02:04.329> really<00:02:04.630> like<00:02:04.719> about

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
used too much why did really like about

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:07.080 
used too much why did really like about
the<00:02:05.289> writing<00:02:05.619> was<00:02:05.890> the<00:02:06.130> quotations<00:02:06.729> that<00:02:06.850> they

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
the writing was the quotations that they

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.730

used<00:02:07.299> within<00:02:07.659> this<00:02:07.929> because<00:02:08.350> they<00:02:08.530> kept

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
used within this because they kept

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.590

lean<00:03:10.750> towards<00:03:11.290> is<00:03:11.440> sort<00:03:11.830> of<00:03:11.860> a<00:03:11.950> steampunk<00:03:12.370> II

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
lean towards is sort of a steampunk II

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.390 
lean towards is sort of a steampunk II
sort<00:03:13.420> of<00:03:13.630> setting<00:03:14.410> just<00:03:14.770> because<00:03:15.100> of<00:03:15.280> the

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
sort of setting just because of the

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.550 
sort of setting just because of the
whole<00:03:15.520> clockwork<00:03:16.150> side<00:03:16.480> of<00:03:16.780> the<00:03:17.050> plot<00:03:17.320> in<00:03:17.440> the
