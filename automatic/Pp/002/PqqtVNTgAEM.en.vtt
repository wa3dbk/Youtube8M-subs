kind of broken up that's really

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:27.750 
kind of broken up that's really
important<00:01:26.620> that<00:01:26.710> you<00:01:26.830> don't<00:01:26.950> so<00:01:27.550> you<00:01:27.610> don't

always you know you pick up a new lens
you<00:01:54.259> spend<00:01:54.500> all<00:01:54.560> the<00:01:54.650> money<00:01:54.680> on<00:01:54.979> it<00:01:55.009> you<00:01:55.130> want

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
you spend all the money on it you want

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.039 
you spend all the money on it you want
it<00:01:55.369> to<00:01:55.490> feel<00:01:55.640> substantial<00:01:56.360> so<00:01:56.540> it<00:01:56.630> does<00:01:56.780> feel

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
it to feel substantial so it does feel

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.109 
it to feel substantial so it does feel
all-metal<00:01:57.680> like<00:01:58.430> it<00:01:58.549> can<00:01:58.670> actually<00:01:58.790> take<00:01:59.090> a

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
all-metal like it can actually take a

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:00.760 
all-metal like it can actually take a
beating<00:01:59.509> I<00:01:59.720> believe<00:02:00.290> these<00:02:00.409> are<00:02:00.470> weather

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
beating I believe these are weather

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.070 
beating I believe these are weather
sealed<00:02:01.070> to<00:02:01.369> or<00:02:01.610> weather<00:02:02.210> resistant<00:02:02.840> whatever

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
sealed to or weather resistant whatever

does have the 77 millimeter filter which
is<00:02:16.940> really<00:02:17.180> important<00:02:17.600> to<00:02:17.750> the<00:02:18.530> 77<00:02:19.130> millimeter

having to buy a new filter for every
lens<00:02:29.810> you<00:02:29.930> can<00:02:30.050> just<00:02:30.230> swap<00:02:30.410> them<00:02:30.620> around<00:02:30.739> to

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
lens you can just swap them around to

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.550 
lens you can just swap them around to
the<00:02:30.920> lens<00:02:31.130> that<00:02:31.220> you're<00:02:31.340> using<00:02:32.319> all<00:02:33.319> right

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
the lens that you're using all right

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.990 
the lens that you're using all right
it's<00:02:33.680> got<00:02:33.800> our<00:02:33.890> auto<00:02:34.010> focus<00:02:34.400> here<00:02:34.580> on<00:02:34.670> the<00:02:34.760> side

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
it's got our auto focus here on the side

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.930 
it's got our auto focus here on the side
it<00:02:35.720> also<00:02:35.780> has<00:02:36.140> vibration<00:02:36.709> control<00:02:37.190> over<00:02:37.700> here

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
it also has vibration control over here

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.729 
it also has vibration control over here
compensation<00:02:38.750> which<00:02:38.959> is<00:02:39.110> basically<00:02:39.410> going<00:02:39.680> to

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
compensation which is basically going to

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.229 
compensation which is basically going to
move<00:02:39.860> a<00:02:39.950> bunch<00:02:40.100> of<00:02:40.220> elements<00:02:40.670> inside<00:02:41.000> your

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
move a bunch of elements inside your

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.150 
move a bunch of elements inside your
camera<00:02:41.569> lens<00:02:41.690> to<00:02:41.989> compensate<00:02:42.920> for<00:02:43.100> your

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
camera lens to compensate for your

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.100 
camera lens to compensate for your
camera<00:02:43.580> shake<00:02:43.790> so<00:02:44.330> it's<00:02:44.450> really<00:02:44.569> cool<00:02:44.810> to<00:02:44.959> see

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
camera shake so it's really cool to see

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.690 
camera shake so it's really cool to see
that<00:02:45.140> especially<00:02:45.530> on<00:02:45.709> the<00:02:45.830> telephoto<00:02:46.310> lenses

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
that especially on the telephoto lenses

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.070 
that especially on the telephoto lenses
where<00:02:46.940> sometimes<00:02:47.330> we<00:02:47.540> have<00:02:47.630> to<00:02:47.720> zoom<00:02:47.930> in

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
where sometimes we have to zoom in

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.930 
where sometimes we have to zoom in
pretty<00:02:48.290> far<00:02:48.560> and<00:02:48.830> that<00:02:49.190> camera<00:02:49.400> shape<00:02:49.670> becomes

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
pretty far and that camera shape becomes

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.490 
pretty far and that camera shape becomes
really<00:02:50.150> apparent<00:02:50.330> if<00:02:50.870> we<00:02:50.989> have<00:02:51.140> an<00:02:51.260> older

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
really apparent if we have an older

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.539 
really apparent if we have an older
model<00:02:51.650> that<00:02:51.860> doesn't<00:02:52.100> have<00:02:52.220> this<00:02:52.340> feature

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
model that doesn't have this feature

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:55.300 
model that doesn't have this feature
there<00:02:52.850> so<00:02:53.810> all<00:02:54.500> in<00:02:54.680> all<00:02:54.769> feels<00:02:55.070> really

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
there so all in all feels really

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.670 
there so all in all feels really
substantial<00:02:55.910> looks<00:02:56.090> great<00:02:56.500> has<00:02:57.500> that

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
substantial looks great has that

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.990 
substantial looks great has that
constant<00:02:58.070> aperture<00:02:58.250> all<00:02:58.519> the<00:02:58.610> way<00:02:58.700> throughout

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
constant aperture all the way throughout

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.240 
constant aperture all the way throughout
has<00:02:59.360> the<00:02:59.450> vibration<00:02:59.930> compensation<00:03:00.530> so<00:03:01.130> it's

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
has the vibration compensation so it's

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:02.229 
has the vibration compensation so it's
got<00:03:01.340> everything<00:03:01.519> I<00:03:01.640> was<00:03:01.730> looking<00:03:01.820> for<00:03:02.120> in<00:03:02.180> a

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
got everything I was looking for in a

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.030 
got everything I was looking for in a
pro<00:03:02.420> zoom<00:03:02.660> so<00:03:03.320> I'm<00:03:03.440> looking<00:03:03.709> forward<00:03:04.010> to

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
pro zoom so I'm looking forward to

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.530 
pro zoom so I'm looking forward to
getting<00:03:04.549> this<00:03:04.609> on<00:03:04.730> the<00:03:04.820> camera<00:03:05.180> and<00:03:05.299> shooting

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
getting this on the camera and shooting

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.780 
getting this on the camera and shooting
with<00:03:05.660> it
