00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.460 
with this thing some camber and it has
pretty<00:02:16.070> good<00:02:16.280> concave<00:02:16.850> as<00:02:17.120> you<00:02:17.300> can<00:02:17.420> see<00:02:17.600> so

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
pretty good concave as you can see so

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.470 
pretty good concave as you can see so
you<00:02:18.830> can<00:02:18.980> still<00:02:19.190> do<00:02:19.340> like<00:02:19.550> downhill<00:02:19.880> slides

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
you can still do like downhill slides

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.960 
you can still do like downhill slides
and<00:02:20.780> stuff<00:02:20.870> like<00:02:21.170> that<00:02:21.230> Mike<00:02:22.130> Coleman's<00:02:22.640> I<00:02:22.910> do

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
and stuff like that Mike Coleman's I do

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.740 
and stuff like that Mike Coleman's I do
oh<00:02:24.220> dang<00:02:25.220> stimulus<00:02:26.470> 70<00:02:27.470> millimeter<00:02:27.920> and

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
oh dang stimulus 70 millimeter and

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.410 
oh dang stimulus 70 millimeter and
they're<00:02:29.750> actually<00:02:29.930> starting<00:02:31.000> kind<00:02:32.000> of<00:02:32.239> to

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
they're actually starting kind of to

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.050 
they're actually starting kind of to

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
cone a tiny bit on this wheel I don't

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.410 
cone a tiny bit on this wheel I don't
know<00:02:35.150> if<00:02:35.209> y'all<00:02:35.360> can<00:02:35.510> see<00:02:35.690> it<00:02:35.840> like<00:02:36.140> barely<00:02:37.420> how

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
know if y'all can see it like barely how

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.720 
know if y'all can see it like barely how
I<00:02:38.450> couldn't<00:02:38.900> see<00:02:39.020> it<00:02:39.140> but<00:02:40.130> it's<00:02:40.190> starting<00:02:40.459> to

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
I couldn't see it but it's starting to

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.030 
I couldn't see it but it's starting to
come<00:02:40.910> on<00:02:41.060> a<00:02:41.150> tiny<00:02:41.420> bit<00:02:41.750> that's<00:02:42.590> really<00:02:42.800> not<00:02:42.980> a

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
come on a tiny bit that's really not a

complaint I mean I mean I've been
sliding<00:02:46.370> these<00:02:46.700> so<00:02:46.970> much<00:02:47.239> and<00:02:47.570> I'm<00:02:47.720> surprised

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
sliding these so much and I'm surprised

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.190 
sliding these so much and I'm surprised
haven't<00:02:48.500> going<00:02:48.800> more<00:02:49.070> than<00:02:49.220> that<00:02:49.870> they<00:02:50.870> slide

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200
