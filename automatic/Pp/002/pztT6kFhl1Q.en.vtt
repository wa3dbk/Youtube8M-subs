actually going to increase our body's
circulation<00:01:44.820> so<00:01:45.149> we<00:01:45.270> absorb<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.750> products<00:01:46.140> a

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
circulation so we absorb the products a

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.469 
circulation so we absorb the products a
lot<00:01:46.350> faster<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.340> we<00:01:47.640> absorb<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:47.970> lot<00:01:48.090> more<00:01:48.299> of

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
lot faster and we absorb a lot more of

lot faster and we absorb a lot more of
the<00:01:48.630> products<00:01:49.110> okay<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.130> then<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.280> NRG

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
the products okay and then the NRG

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.490 
the products okay and then the NRG
what's<00:01:51.149> weird<00:01:51.360> about<00:01:51.450> NRG<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.170> no<00:01:52.259> one<00:01:52.380> can

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500

to<00:01:54.329> okay<00:01:54.630> but<00:01:55.140> in<00:01:55.350> our<00:01:55.470> gene<00:01:55.740> when<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:55.920> mix<00:01:56.100> it

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
to okay but in our gene when you mix it

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.190 
to okay but in our gene when you mix it
with<00:01:56.430> pearl<00:01:56.729> essa<00:01:56.969> okay<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.750> creates<00:01:58.079> like

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
with pearl essa okay it creates like

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.929 
with pearl essa okay it creates like
this<00:01:58.350> fat<00:01:58.710> burning<00:01:59.100> effect<00:01:59.369> inside<00:01:59.610> our<00:01:59.759> body

so we're going to put portal I mean NRG

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.709 
so we're going to put portal I mean NRG
in<00:02:01.799> there<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.189> energy<00:02:03.030> also<00:02:03.180> gives<00:02:03.450> us<00:02:03.540> energy

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
in there and energy also gives us energy

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.690 
in there and energy also gives us energy
songs<00:02:04.200> put<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.380> little<00:02:04.649> bit<00:02:04.920> of<00:02:04.979> extra<00:02:05.250> in<00:02:05.579> our

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
GM ma shake so I got energy and

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.800 
GM ma shake so I got energy and
digestive<00:02:08.399> cleanse<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:09.000> fat<00:02:09.239> eliminating

our<00:02:13.780> shaker<00:02:14.200> top<00:02:14.530> and<00:02:15.000> instead<00:02:16.000> of<00:02:16.060> just

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
our shaker top and instead of just

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.210 
our shaker top and instead of just
shaking<00:02:17.110> it<00:02:17.230> up<00:02:17.290> like<00:02:17.470> this<00:02:17.500> I'm<00:02:18.100> actually

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
shaking it up like this I'm actually

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.370 
shaking it up like this I'm actually
going<00:02:18.460> to<00:02:18.550> swirl<00:02:18.850> it<00:02:19.150> and<00:02:19.720> the<00:02:19.990> reason<00:02:20.140> why<00:02:20.350> is

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
going to swirl it and the reason why is

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.660 
going to swirl it and the reason why is
it's<00:02:20.560> going<00:02:20.680> to<00:02:20.740> sink<00:02:20.890> all<00:02:21.070> the<00:02:21.160> products<00:02:21.520> down
