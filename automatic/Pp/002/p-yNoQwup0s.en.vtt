one<00:00:00.359> of<00:00:00.480> my<00:00:00.630> goals<00:00:00.810> with<00:00:01.140> my<00:00:01.350> food<00:00:01.560> storage<00:00:01.890> is

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
one of my goals with my food storage is

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:04.249 
one of my goals with my food storage is
to<00:00:02.669> replace<00:00:03.000> the<00:00:03.210> things<00:00:03.389> I<00:00:03.629> bought<00:00:03.870> with

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
to replace the things I bought with

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.440 
to replace the things I bought with
things<00:00:04.500> that<00:00:04.620> I<00:00:04.770> produced<00:00:05.009> myself<00:00:05.730> now<00:00:06.270> I<00:00:06.299> know

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
things that I produced myself now I know

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.990 
things that I produced myself now I know
that<00:00:06.810> I<00:00:06.870> can't<00:00:07.200> grow<00:00:07.529> and<00:00:07.710> can<00:00:07.950> everything<00:00:08.580> but

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
that I can't grow and can everything but

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.610 
that I can't grow and can everything but
peanut<00:00:09.480> butter<00:00:09.780> was<00:00:09.990> something<00:00:10.380> that<00:00:10.410> I

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
peanut butter was something that I

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.520 
peanut butter was something that I
thought<00:00:10.800> I<00:00:10.860> might<00:00:11.160> be<00:00:11.280> able<00:00:11.400> to<00:00:11.519> pull<00:00:11.700> off<00:00:11.730> I

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:12.530 
thought I might be able to pull off I

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.079 
thought I might be able to pull off I
live<00:00:13.530> in<00:00:13.650> Virginia<00:00:13.799> and<00:00:14.400> they<00:00:14.610> grow<00:00:14.759> a<00:00:14.790> lot<00:00:15.000> of

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
live in Virginia and they grow a lot of

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.150 
live in Virginia and they grow a lot of
peanuts<00:00:15.540> here<00:00:15.839> but<00:00:16.320> I've<00:00:16.440> never<00:00:16.619> seen<00:00:16.980> them

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
peanuts here but I've never seen them

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.640 
peanuts here but I've never seen them
growing<00:00:17.430> in<00:00:17.609> my<00:00:17.760> area<00:00:18.270> so<00:00:18.539> I<00:00:18.869> wasn't<00:00:19.289> sure<00:00:19.500> if

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
growing in my area so I wasn't sure if

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.670 
growing in my area so I wasn't sure if
my<00:00:19.830> soil<00:00:20.039> would<00:00:20.340> work<00:00:20.550> or<00:00:20.760> not<00:00:21.289> since<00:00:22.289> I<00:00:22.410> didn't

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
my soil would work or not since I didn't

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.620 
my soil would work or not since I didn't
want<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:23.010> waste<00:00:23.189> a<00:00:23.369> lot<00:00:23.400> of<00:00:23.640> garden<00:00:24.029> space<00:00:24.180> on

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
want to waste a lot of garden space on

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.810 
want to waste a lot of garden space on
something<00:00:25.080> that<00:00:25.260> might<00:00:25.529> not<00:00:25.769> work<00:00:26.070> I<00:00:26.430> decided

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
something that might not work I decided

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.019 
something that might not work I decided
to<00:00:27.810> use<00:00:28.260> space<00:00:28.710> that<00:00:28.980> was<00:00:29.189> wasted<00:00:29.490> in<00:00:29.910> the

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
to use space that was wasted in the

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:30.859 
to use space that was wasted in the
first<00:00:30.300> place

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
first place

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.549 
first place
so<00:00:31.560> I<00:00:31.590> tilled<00:00:32.460> up<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:33.090> path<00:00:33.360> between<00:00:33.660> two<00:00:33.930> rows

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
so I tilled up the path between two rows

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.819 
so I tilled up the path between two rows
and<00:00:34.980> I<00:00:35.309> planted<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.850> peanuts<00:00:36.270> in<00:00:36.450> them<00:00:36.719> if<00:00:37.620> you

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
and I planted the peanuts in them if you

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.619 
and I planted the peanuts in them if you
look<00:00:37.980> closely<00:00:38.309> between<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.000> two<00:00:39.180> rows<00:00:39.390> of

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
look closely between the two rows of

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.630 
look closely between the two rows of
cabbage<00:00:40.170> you'll<00:00:40.649> see<00:00:40.860> that<00:00:40.980> I<00:00:41.070> have<00:00:41.100> peanuts

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
cabbage you'll see that I have peanuts

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.000 
cabbage you'll see that I have peanuts
grow<00:00:41.850> in<00:00:42.059> there

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.220 

worked<00:00:47.190> out<00:00:47.309> very<00:00:47.370> well<00:00:47.789> by<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.420> time<00:00:48.570> the

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
worked out very well by the time the

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.170 
worked out very well by the time the
peanuts<00:00:49.710> were<00:00:50.339> large<00:00:50.640> enough<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:50.969> they

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
peanuts were large enough that they

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.389 
peanuts were large enough that they
needed<00:00:51.390> more<00:00:51.510> room<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.230> pulled<00:00:52.859> the<00:00:52.980> cabbage

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
needed more room I pulled the cabbage

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.009 
needed more room I pulled the cabbage
out<00:00:53.609> and<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:53.850> gave<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.120> peanuts<00:00:54.510> room<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.899> grow

00:00:57.009 --> 00:00:57.019 
out and it gave the peanuts room to grow

00:00:57.019 --> 00:00:59.899 
out and it gave the peanuts room to grow
here<00:00:58.019> I<00:00:58.289> have<00:00:58.500> them<00:00:58.649> grow<00:00:58.890> in<00:00:59.039> between<00:00:59.370> rows<00:00:59.640> of

00:00:59.899 --> 00:00:59.909 
here I have them grow in between rows of

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:02.209 
here I have them grow in between rows of
potatoes<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.690> lettuce<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.350> by<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:01.949> time

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
potatoes and lettuce and by the time

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.100 
potatoes and lettuce and by the time
they<00:01:02.430> needed<00:01:02.640> more<00:01:02.850> room<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.539> potatoes<00:01:03.989> and

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
they needed more room the potatoes and

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:11.880 
they needed more room the potatoes and
lettuce<00:01:04.470> were<00:01:04.649> gone

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.520 

when<00:01:12.400> you<00:01:12.520> plant<00:01:12.790> peanuts<00:01:13.120> the<00:01:13.720> soil<00:01:14.080> needs<00:01:14.410> to

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
when you plant peanuts the soil needs to

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.160 
when you plant peanuts the soil needs to
be<00:01:14.620> good<00:01:14.890> and<00:01:15.070> warm<00:01:15.340> if<00:01:16.270> you<00:01:16.480> plant<00:01:16.720> them<00:01:16.840> too

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
be good and warm if you plant them too

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.760 
be good and warm if you plant them too
soon<00:01:17.530> they<00:01:18.370> will<00:01:18.550> right<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:20.290> first<00:01:20.500> time<00:01:20.740> I

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
soon they will right the first time I

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.710 
soon they will right the first time I
planted<00:01:21.220> them<00:01:21.370> I<00:01:21.580> planted<00:01:21.910> them<00:01:22.030> too<00:01:22.240> soon<00:01:22.480> and

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
indeed they rotted the second time I

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.560 
indeed they rotted the second time I
planted<00:01:26.020> them<00:01:26.230> on<00:01:26.680> me<00:01:26.950> first<00:01:27.370> and<00:01:27.790> they<00:01:28.420> came

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570

bag<00:01:31.570> of<00:01:31.600> raw<00:01:32.050> peanuts<00:01:32.700> they<00:01:33.700> have<00:01:33.910> to<00:01:34.120> be<00:01:34.270> raw

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
bag of raw peanuts they have to be raw

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.530 
bag of raw peanuts they have to be raw
and<00:01:35.020> I<00:01:35.740> shelled<00:01:36.040> them<00:01:36.310> out<00:01:36.640> and<00:01:36.940> planted<00:01:37.420> them

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
and I shelled them out and planted them

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.980 
and I shelled them out and planted them
about<00:01:37.840> three<00:01:38.229> inches<00:01:38.590> deep<00:01:39.300> the<00:01:40.300> peanuts<00:01:40.810> were

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
about three inches deep the peanuts were

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.750 
about three inches deep the peanuts were
some<00:01:41.320> of<00:01:41.440> the<00:01:41.530> most<00:01:41.680> interesting<00:01:42.070> plants<00:01:42.640> I've

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:42.760 
some of the most interesting plants I've

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:43.650 
some of the most interesting plants I've
ever<00:01:42.940> grown

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:43.660 
ever grown

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.560 
ever grown
they<00:01:44.080> are<00:01:44.590> bushy<00:01:45.070> they<00:01:45.550> get<00:01:45.700> about<00:01:45.910> 18<00:01:46.330> inches

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
they are bushy they get about 18 inches

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.920 
they are bushy they get about 18 inches
tall<00:01:46.990> and<00:01:47.850> they'll<00:01:48.850> bloom<00:01:49.150> they<00:01:49.780> get

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
tall and they'll bloom they get

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.760 
tall and they'll bloom they get
pollinated<00:01:50.440> then<00:01:50.950> the<00:01:51.040> bloom<00:01:51.310> falls<00:01:51.700> off<00:01:52.770> then

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
pollinated then the bloom falls off then

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.040 
pollinated then the bloom falls off then
the<00:01:54.009> stem<00:01:54.340> of<00:01:54.610> the<00:01:54.790> bloom<00:01:55.060> will<00:01:55.420> start<00:01:55.690> to<00:01:55.840> get

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 
the stem of the bloom will start to get

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.609 
the stem of the bloom will start to get
long<00:01:56.350> and<00:01:56.710> the<00:01:57.930> pollinated<00:01:58.930> end<00:01:59.170> will<00:01:59.410> burrow

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
long and the pollinated end will burrow

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.889 
long and the pollinated end will burrow
down<00:01:59.920> into<00:02:00.369> the<00:02:00.490> ground<00:02:00.790> and<00:02:01.090> a<00:02:01.149> peanut<00:02:01.479> forms

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
down into the ground and a peanut forms
