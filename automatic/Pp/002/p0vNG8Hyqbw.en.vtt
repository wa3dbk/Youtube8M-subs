has some antioxidants in it that spinach
doesn't<00:00:40.260> cover<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:41.040> I'd<00:00:41.940> like<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.270> put<00:00:42.480> a

cilantro is a great liver tonic and

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.090 
cilantro is a great liver tonic and
really<00:00:46.680> goes<00:00:46.829> well<00:00:47.100> into<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.730> smoothie<00:00:48.239> now

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.020 
really goes well into a smoothie now
next<00:00:50.100> we're<00:00:50.219> going<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.370> talk<00:00:50.550> about<00:00:50.760> some

next we're going to talk about some
things<00:00:51.270> that<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:51.989> may<00:00:52.260> not<00:00:52.469> have<00:00:52.620> thought<00:00:52.770> of

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
things that you may not have thought of

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.799 
things that you may not have thought of
putting<00:00:53.190> in<00:00:53.280> your<00:00:53.370> smoothie<00:00:53.760> many<00:00:54.360> people<00:00:54.660> put

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
putting in your smoothie many people put

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.779 
putting in your smoothie many people put
avocados<00:00:55.530> in<00:00:55.710> their<00:00:55.829> smoothie<00:00:56.280> but<00:00:56.520> don't

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
avocados in their smoothie but don't

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.970 
avocados in their smoothie but don't
realize<00:00:57.239> that<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.600> seed<00:00:58.050> is<00:00:58.469> actually<00:00:58.739> a

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
realize that the seed is actually a

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.720 
realize that the seed is actually a
great<00:00:59.460> source<00:00:59.940> of<00:01:00.320> anti<00:01:01.320> carcinogens<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.520> has

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
great source of anti carcinogens it has

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.789 
great source of anti carcinogens it has
some<00:01:02.940> immune<00:01:03.270> boosting<00:01:03.690> properties<00:01:03.989> it's

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
some immune boosting properties it's

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.340 
some immune boosting properties it's
really<00:01:05.489> rich<00:01:05.850> in<00:01:06.210> nourishing<00:01:06.780> sources<00:01:07.200> of

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
really rich in nourishing sources of

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.410 
really rich in nourishing sources of
fiber<00:01:07.650> it's<00:01:08.010> got<00:01:08.189> flavonoids<00:01:08.820> in<00:01:08.939> it<00:01:09.060> that

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
fiber it's got flavonoids in it that

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.179 
fiber it's got flavonoids in it that
seed<00:01:09.750> is<00:01:09.930> actually<00:01:10.080> really<00:01:10.470> beneficial<00:01:10.890> so

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
seed is actually really beneficial so

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.100 
seed is actually really beneficial so
when<00:01:11.310> I<00:01:11.430> blend<00:01:11.790> I'm<00:01:12.330> actually<00:01:12.600> just<00:01:12.840> going<00:01:13.049> to

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
when I blend I'm actually just going to

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.649 
when I blend I'm actually just going to
drop<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.470> seed<00:01:13.680> right<00:01:13.920> in<00:01:14.100> there<00:01:14.310> now<00:01:15.180> another

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
drop the seed right in there now another

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.890 
drop the seed right in there now another
thing<00:01:16.049> that<00:01:16.530> we<00:01:16.799> tend<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.250> kind<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.850> not<00:01:18.540> really

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
thing that we tend to kind of not really

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.010 
thing that we tend to kind of not really
bear<00:01:19.259> in<00:01:19.500> mind<00:01:19.890> when<00:01:20.520> we<00:01:20.880> cook<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.780> fact

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
bear in mind when we cook is the fact

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.530 
bear in mind when we cook is the fact
that<00:01:22.140> eggs<00:01:22.560> are<00:01:22.979> incredibly<00:01:23.729> rich<00:01:24.180> in

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
that eggs are incredibly rich in

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.200 
that eggs are incredibly rich in
minerals<00:01:25.530> specifically<00:01:26.159> eggshells<00:01:26.880> and

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
minerals specifically eggshells and

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.999 
minerals specifically eggshells and
sometimes<00:01:27.689> we<00:01:28.259> don't<00:01:28.380> actually<00:01:28.619> eat<00:01:28.860> the

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
sometimes we don't actually eat the

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.679 
sometimes we don't actually eat the
eggshell<00:01:29.400> so<00:01:29.610> today<00:01:29.909> I'm<00:01:30.119> just<00:01:30.150> gonna<00:01:30.329> drop

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
eggshell so today I'm just gonna drop

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.109 
eggshell so today I'm just gonna drop
this<00:01:31.140> whole<00:01:31.439> egg<00:01:31.710> along<00:01:32.130> with<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.520> shell<00:01:32.790> into

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
this whole egg along with the shell into

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.450 
this whole egg along with the shell into
my<00:01:33.329> blender<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:34.200> that<00:01:34.890> would<00:01:35.009> go<00:01:35.100> in<00:01:35.189> there<00:01:35.340> as

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
my blender and that would go in there as

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.870 
my blender and that would go in there as
well<00:01:35.610> now<00:01:35.909> I<00:01:36.840> like<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.590> eat<00:01:37.770> broccoli<00:01:38.189> broccoli

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
again is fantastic in terms of its

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.950 
again is fantastic in terms of its
cancer<00:01:41.549> cancer-fighting<00:01:42.180> properties<00:01:42.360> its

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
cancer cancer-fighting properties its

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.319 
cancer cancer-fighting properties its
antioxidants<00:01:43.770> but<00:01:43.920> sometimes<00:01:44.399> when<00:01:45.030> we<00:01:45.149> use

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
antioxidants but sometimes when we use

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.469 
antioxidants but sometimes when we use
broccoli<00:01:45.710> we<00:01:46.710> actually<00:01:47.159> forget<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.790> eat<00:01:48.000> the

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
broccoli we actually forget to eat the

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.530 
broccoli we actually forget to eat the
stem<00:01:48.869> which<00:01:49.470> has<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.890> lot<00:01:50.220> of<00:01:50.250> antioxidants<00:01:50.880> in

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
stem which has a lot of antioxidants in

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.050 
stem which has a lot of antioxidants in
it<00:01:51.720> that<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.259> florets<00:01:52.740> don't<00:01:53.310> actually<00:01:53.610> have

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
it that the florets don't actually have

through that thick outer hole so I'm

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.720

for a lot of their nutrients to get

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:46.089 
for a lot of their nutrients to get
released<00:02:44.569> now<00:02:45.349> just<00:02:45.530> a<00:02:45.620> couple<00:02:45.769> of<00:02:45.980> other

to<00:04:18.079> be<00:04:18.139> absorbed<00:04:18.769> by<00:04:18.889> my<00:04:19.070> body<00:04:19.220> to<00:04:19.609> break<00:04:19.910> down

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
to be absorbed by my body to break down

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.610 
to be absorbed by my body to break down
the<00:04:20.359> cell<00:04:20.570> walls<00:04:20.840> and

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
the cell walls and

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.500 
the cell walls and
to<00:04:21.950> get<00:04:22.160> a<00:04:22.190> lot<00:04:22.400> of<00:04:22.520> those<00:04:22.640> nutrients<00:04:23.150> released

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
to get a lot of those nutrients released

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.040 
to get a lot of those nutrients released
is<00:04:23.720> this<00:04:24.440> Omni<00:04:25.070> blender<00:04:25.460> so<00:04:25.910> the<00:04:26.420> Omni<00:04:26.720> blender

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
is this Omni blender so the Omni blender

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.930 
is this Omni blender so the Omni blender
all<00:04:27.200> I<00:04:27.230> did<00:04:27.440> was<00:04:27.620> this<00:04:27.770> was<00:04:28.010> I<00:04:28.100> pushed<00:04:28.340> the<00:04:28.490> 60

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
all I did was this was I pushed the 60

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.840 
all I did was this was I pushed the 60
so<00:04:29.390> in<00:04:29.690> 60<00:04:30.230> seconds<00:04:30.740> it<00:04:30.890> blended<00:04:31.400> all<00:04:31.520> of<00:04:31.670> that

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
so in 60 seconds it blended all of that

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.120 
so in 60 seconds it blended all of that
and<00:04:32.060> what<00:04:32.510> it<00:04:32.630> does<00:04:32.780> is<00:04:32.930> it<00:04:33.050> goes<00:04:33.230> high-speed

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
and what it does is it goes high-speed

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.040 
and what it does is it goes high-speed
for<00:04:34.760> a<00:04:34.790> little<00:04:35.030> bit<00:04:35.150> and<00:04:35.360> then<00:04:35.570> it<00:04:35.690> drops<00:04:35.900> it

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
for a little bit and then it drops it

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:37.390 
for a little bit and then it drops it
down<00:04:36.110> to<00:04:36.260> low<00:04:36.410> speed<00:04:36.680> and<00:04:36.800> then<00:04:36.920> brings<00:04:37.100> up<00:04:37.280> to

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
down to low speed and then brings up to

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.190 
down to low speed and then brings up to
a<00:04:37.430> really<00:04:37.820> high<00:04:37.970> speed<00:04:38.030> to<00:04:38.510> finish<00:04:38.840> off<00:04:39.020> the

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200
