all about you know we played Colorado
College<00:02:04.140> I<00:02:04.350> think<00:02:04.560> five<00:02:04.890> times<00:02:05.220> in<00:02:05.640> the

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
College I think five times in the

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.430 
College I think five times in the
history<00:02:06.030> of<00:02:06.240> our<00:02:06.360> program<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:07.020> was<00:02:07.170> number

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
history of our program and was number

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.900 
history of our program and was number
one<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:08.070> so<00:02:08.310> this<00:02:08.940> is<00:02:09.209> a<00:02:09.239> huge<00:02:09.509> stride<00:02:09.959> for<00:02:10.200> us

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
one and so this is a huge stride for us

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.160 
one and so this is a huge stride for us
you<00:02:11.910> know<00:02:12.030> just<00:02:12.239> to<00:02:12.330> be<00:02:12.480> able<00:02:12.570> to<00:02:12.720> hang<00:02:12.959> with

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
you know just to be able to hang with

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.199 
you know just to be able to hang with
them<00:02:13.380> I<00:02:13.620> thought<00:02:13.800> it<00:02:14.130> was<00:02:14.250> a<00:02:14.280> pretty<00:02:14.580> you<00:02:15.090> know

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
them I thought it was a pretty you know

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.330

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
I thought they had lots of several

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.430 
I thought they had lots of several
opportunities<00:02:21.030> and<00:02:21.690> I<00:02:21.750> thought<00:02:21.930> we<00:02:22.110> had<00:02:22.290> some

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
opportunities and I thought we had some

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.979 
opportunities and I thought we had some
good<00:02:22.590> opportunities<00:02:23.370> as<00:02:23.580> well<00:02:23.760> and<00:02:24.180> I<00:02:24.810> told

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
good opportunities as well and I told

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.199 
good opportunities as well and I told

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
our team at halftime it's just gonna be

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.059 
our team at halftime it's just gonna be
a<00:02:27.239> matter<00:02:27.480> of<00:02:27.600> who<00:02:28.050> finishes<00:02:28.440> their<00:02:28.800> chance

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
a matter of who finishes their chance

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.620 
a matter of who finishes their chance
because<00:02:29.430> I<00:02:29.519> knew<00:02:29.700> that<00:02:29.730> both<00:02:30.060> teams<00:02:30.330> would<00:02:30.480> get

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
because I knew that both teams would get

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.750 
because I knew that both teams would get
chances<00:02:31.019> so<00:02:31.260> I'm<00:02:31.860> really<00:02:32.040> proud<00:02:32.310> of<00:02:32.370> our<00:02:32.579> team

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
chances so I'm really proud of our team

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.240 
chances so I'm really proud of our team
I<00:02:33.060> think<00:02:33.290> they're<00:02:34.290> just<00:02:34.440> riding<00:02:34.890> on<00:02:34.980> a<00:02:35.010> lot<00:02:35.220> of

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
I think they're just riding on a lot of

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.970 
I think they're just riding on a lot of
confidence<00:02:35.640> right<00:02:35.940> now
