00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:06.940
 but 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.920
 hello yourself are there is a rich 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.320
 motor will beat the thunder fighter and craft 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.910
 life indicator well, naturally not a bridge 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.189
 as you are already present 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:25.029
 indicator of your opponent's life so 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:26.890
 say this is a player then this is a resident there 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.080
 then this zombie and hung can see 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.029
 amount of health in a resident's health 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.970
 as much as the player is exactly 20 gender 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:35.620
 heart is also considered life and how 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.360
 see talent bows everything looks 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.699
 top left and yes the same picture 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.239
 moba but if I could say so 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:42.430
 such 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.020
 low functionality 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.059
 began to review actually functions in 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.950
 it more than it seems at first glance 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:50.489
 and now all these functions we will see 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:53.140
 well i think you are more than that besides 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.930
 It appears to live and seem zombies and 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.180
 man but more on that later I start 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.100
 let's see what else we have this mod first what 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.350
 he can breathe i like it that 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.619
 you can see the effect and potions from rush 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:08.259
 potions and as you can see at the moment on 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:11.380
 residents 4 effects night vision speed 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:13.420
 then she sat down and like a business card a knife with blood 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.000
 this is poisoning as you see he is poisoned 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.410
 Here is such an interesting feature that even 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.959
 on play i can all what is on it 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:22.390
 effects and server slices will be good 

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:25.149
 help ok let's see more functions 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.349
 one more function is such a function 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:28.630
 which allows us to see houses 

00:01:26.349 --> 00:01:30.550
 which we say so we put what we 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.800
 hit him with a diamond sword wrote 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.860
 tsiferku 7 that is, we hit many times writes 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:38.500
 many times the number 7 on the other is already a sword 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.780
 fran ff4 will swear that is despite 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.940
 the fact that he has a little life properties 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.099
 will show the number to monster thoughts 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.590
 sometimes critical hits like 

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:50.470
 top here so try to see Che 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.149
 we usually have 7 but if we try 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.000
 Of course, here from a height then we will 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:56.950
 more or one less damage overall 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.259
 here are now the case and the hour is now unlikely 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.830
 whether I can do it all try somehow 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:05.380
 like that no I can't beat crit but no 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.440
 but unfortunately but there are such but 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.270
 such is the kind of thing 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.130
 the final box we wear the race minister 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.530
 cool i think on the server come in handy 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.220

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.930
