00:00:00.804 --> 00:00:02.838
- We are on another trip,

00:00:02.838 --> 00:00:03.735
and what?

00:00:03.735 --> 00:00:05.343
- Tracy got (unclear).

00:00:05.343 --> 00:00:06.370
She won the lottery.

00:00:08.677 --> 00:00:09.236
- You know what else I also got?

00:00:09.236 --> 00:00:10.085
- What?

00:00:10.085 --> 00:00:11.017
- The hand swab test.

00:00:11.017 --> 00:00:11.681
- You know what else I got?

00:00:11.681 --> 00:00:12.011
- What?

00:00:12.011 --> 00:00:13.267
- A bag check.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:15.935
I thought something was going on with you

00:00:15.935 --> 00:00:16.582
while we were there.

00:00:16.582 --> 00:00:18.727
- We're not exactly too grateful for that.

00:00:20.278 --> 00:00:22.249
When I went through the thing,

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:23.799
it was automatic.

00:00:23.968 --> 00:00:26.366
Does this one have diet caffeine free?

00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:27.771
- You always ask that.

00:00:27.771 --> 00:00:30.443
- I know the other one down there did.

00:00:30.443 --> 00:00:32.968
We're gonna be late, oh my God, oh my God.

00:00:47.496 --> 00:00:48.264
Hi guys.

00:00:48.264 --> 00:00:49.140
- We're on our day one

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.878
epic adventure in Tucson.

00:00:50.878 --> 00:00:51.877
- Wooo!

00:00:52.077 --> 00:00:54.636
- First on the adventure list is hiking.

00:00:54.636 --> 00:00:55.718
We're gonna go to the top

00:00:55.718 --> 00:00:56.728
of that mountain back there.

00:00:58.018 --> 00:01:00.108
- We're hoping not to see

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:01.985
snakes, or bobcats,

00:01:02.507 --> 00:01:04.375
or lions, tigers, and bears.

00:01:04.375 --> 00:01:05.433
- Oh, my.
- Oh, my.

00:01:06.662 --> 00:01:08.823
C'mon, let's go.

00:01:15.888 --> 00:01:17.117
Mid-hike update.

00:01:17.117 --> 00:01:18.022
We're hikin',

00:01:18.022 --> 00:01:19.747
and there's lot of bugs.

00:01:19.747 --> 00:01:20.581
- Mid-hike,

00:01:20.581 --> 00:01:21.532
lots of gnats in my ears.

00:01:21.532 --> 00:01:23.719
- Look at that pretty cactus.

00:01:24.168 --> 00:01:25.462
- We're gonna keep goin'

00:01:25.462 --> 00:01:26.960
and, look at those mountains right there,

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.076
out in the distance.

00:01:28.076 --> 00:01:29.626
That's where we're headed.

00:01:42.517 --> 00:01:44.853
- All right, mid mid-hike update.

00:01:44.853 --> 00:01:46.486
My sunglasses are getting foggy.

00:01:46.486 --> 00:01:47.837
Do yours keep doin' that?

00:01:47.837 --> 00:01:49.768
- No, I just feel real sweaty.

00:01:49.768 --> 00:01:50.657
- Yeah, we're gross.

00:01:50.657 --> 00:01:52.271
I think we've hiked

00:01:52.271 --> 00:01:53.176
over a mile and a half.

00:01:53.176 --> 00:01:54.455
- A little over a mile.

00:01:54.455 --> 00:01:55.493
- A little over a mile?

00:01:55.493 --> 00:01:56.987
A little over a mile,

00:01:56.987 --> 00:01:58.239
but we stopped along the way

00:01:58.239 --> 00:01:59.288
so it's been a--

00:01:59.288 --> 00:02:00.056
- Takin' pictures.

00:02:00.056 --> 00:02:01.503
- Scenic hike.

00:02:01.503 --> 00:02:03.295
I think we're gonna hike
a little bit more, but,

00:02:03.295 --> 00:02:04.647
I don't think we're gonna

00:02:04.647 --> 00:02:06.070
go over five miles.

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.961
- We met a really cool guy

00:02:06.961 --> 00:02:08.208
that's out here takin' photos

00:02:08.208 --> 00:02:09.788
and he's being like tour guide for us,

00:02:09.788 --> 00:02:10.364
it's really cool.

00:02:10.364 --> 00:02:11.676
- He's telling us about all the flowers

00:02:11.676 --> 00:02:12.388
and the tortoises.

00:02:12.388 --> 00:02:12.830
- He's lookin' for a tortoise

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:13.748
so we're tryin' to help him.

00:02:13.748 --> 00:02:16.011
- Would you say tortoises or torti?

00:02:16.011 --> 00:02:16.788
(laughing)

00:02:16.788 --> 00:02:17.456
This is really fun though

00:02:17.456 --> 00:02:18.756
cuz they were talking about how

00:02:18.756 --> 00:02:20.048
this is like

00:02:20.048 --> 00:02:21.645
before civilization, nature.

00:02:21.645 --> 00:02:23.763
- Yeah, and he showed us this big rock

00:02:23.763 --> 00:02:25.588
that had a thing like smoothed out,

00:02:25.588 --> 00:02:27.302
and he said Indians used to

00:02:27.302 --> 00:02:30.092
grind mesquite pot, I think
is what he said there.

00:02:30.303 --> 00:02:32.057
So, it's really cool.

00:02:32.287 --> 00:02:33.147
Havin' a lot of fun.

00:02:33.147 --> 00:02:34.278
- Nature, history,

00:02:34.278 --> 00:02:36.173
it's everywhere.

00:02:40.237 --> 00:02:42.118
- Oh my God, it's a snake.

00:02:42.302 --> 00:02:44.794
Oh my God, it's like 10 feet long!

00:02:45.367 --> 00:02:47.312
Just kidding, it's like
a foot long, maybe.

00:03:10.772 --> 00:03:12.487
- We're havin' a spa day.

00:03:12.487 --> 00:03:14.647
- We're at Canyon Ranch,
it's super peaceful.

00:03:14.647 --> 00:03:16.489
We just went out by a founitain

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.325
and just got to our inner

00:03:19.325 --> 00:03:20.089
- Peace.
- Took it all in.

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:21.209
- Now we're going to get ready

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.992
to go see 311, yeah!

00:03:24.361 --> 00:03:26.489
So excited, cannot even wait.

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.473
- I hope they write me a love song.

00:03:28.887 --> 00:03:30.101
- They might.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.321
Yay!

00:03:34.266 --> 00:03:35.398
- Hi guys.

00:03:35.398 --> 00:03:36.967
We are going to a concert.

00:03:36.967 --> 00:03:38.221
- We're gonna see 311!

00:03:38.221 --> 00:03:40.716
- Get excited, whoop whoop.

00:03:40.716 --> 00:03:42.556
It's raining and we're gross.

00:03:42.556 --> 00:03:44.307
- Apparently, there's a
thing called a monsoon

00:03:44.307 --> 00:03:45.973
and it happens in Arizona.

00:03:45.973 --> 00:03:46.971
- It's been happenin' all day.

00:03:46.971 --> 00:03:47.928
- What?

00:03:47.928 --> 00:03:51.120
So, the hair's a little damp and frizzy.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.060
That's not gonna stop us

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.234
from havin' an epic time in the concert.

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:17.753
- Hi guys.

00:04:17.753 --> 00:04:20.046
- Day two, (unclear).

00:04:20.046 --> 00:04:22.305
- We are goin' on a cave tour

00:04:22.305 --> 00:04:23.592
at Kartchner Caverns.

00:04:23.592 --> 00:04:24.927
- We're gonna put on our hard helmet,

00:04:24.927 --> 00:04:26.222
our lights on, and we're gonna,

00:04:26.222 --> 00:04:27.787
cave crawl, not really.

00:04:27.787 --> 00:04:28.993
- Learn all about water

00:04:28.993 --> 00:04:30.377
and how it could--

00:04:30.377 --> 00:04:31.915
there's a lizard.

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.738
We're really excited and we can't wait.

00:04:35.738 --> 00:04:36.928
Yay!

00:04:41.845 --> 00:04:43.413
- You guys, update.

00:04:43.413 --> 00:04:45.115
- We just saw a rattlesnake.

00:04:45.115 --> 00:04:46.036
- We were getting ready to go

00:04:46.036 --> 00:04:47.453
into the caves, and

00:04:47.453 --> 00:04:48.331
there was a rattlesnake

00:04:48.331 --> 00:04:49.543
over by the place you meet up.

00:04:49.543 --> 00:04:50.997
- We totally watched a guy wrangle it.

00:04:50.997 --> 00:04:53.227
- It was like (makes crashing sounds),

00:04:53.227 --> 00:04:55.833
"I'm angry, I'm angry,"
(makes crashing sound).

00:04:55.833 --> 00:04:57.297
- They thought it was a
mojave and she was like,

00:04:57.297 --> 00:04:59.107
"It's the angriest of all of them."

00:04:59.107 --> 00:05:00.464
Then we found out it was a blacktail.

00:05:00.464 --> 00:05:01.440
- Which apparently are

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.039
slightly more docile.

00:05:03.315 --> 00:05:04.287
That's why it didn't rattle as much

00:05:04.287 --> 00:05:05.997
until they got, like, up on it.

00:05:05.997 --> 00:05:06.848
Some lady almost got up on it

00:05:06.848 --> 00:05:08.684
before, you know,

00:05:08.684 --> 00:05:09.611
she would've been unlucky.

00:05:09.611 --> 00:05:11.467
- Yeah, it was totally epic.

00:05:11.467 --> 00:05:12.636
- First rattlesnake
we've seen, that's epic.

00:05:12.636 --> 00:05:13.529
- Yeah, totally.

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:15.942
Two snakes on one trip.

00:05:15.942 --> 00:05:17.642
And one on the plane.

00:05:20.594 --> 00:05:22.480
- We're going into the cave.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.074
Come on.

00:05:25.205 --> 00:05:28.539
Look at the stalactites
and the stalagmites.

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:30.870
That is called somethin' column,

00:05:31.008 --> 00:05:32.029
it's column.

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:32.991
- Here we go.

00:05:32.991 --> 00:05:34.163
I don't recommend doing this hike

00:05:34.163 --> 00:05:36.456
in skirts and sandals.

00:05:36.456 --> 00:05:38.121
Very dangerous.

00:05:38.121 --> 00:05:39.093
- I can't see.

00:05:39.093 --> 00:05:40.135
- I'm so scared.

00:05:40.135 --> 00:05:41.667
- I'm so scared.

00:05:41.667 --> 00:05:43.402
I'm so scared.

00:05:45.801 --> 00:05:47.827
- This is so cool.

00:05:51.948 --> 00:05:53.489
We made it out of the cave alive.

00:05:53.489 --> 00:05:55.009
- Just barely.

00:05:58.901 --> 00:06:00.151
- Whew.

00:06:09.364 --> 00:06:10.495
- Hi guys.

00:06:10.495 --> 00:06:12.989
We are the Sonoran Desert Museum,

00:06:12.989 --> 00:06:14.253
that's what we think it's called.

00:06:14.253 --> 00:06:15.921
- We at least know we're
in the Sonoran Desert,

00:06:15.921 --> 00:06:17.223
and it's so beautiful out here.

00:06:17.223 --> 00:06:18.371
- I was just reading about

00:06:18.371 --> 00:06:19.879
all these ancient like,

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:21.551
volcanic remains and things

00:06:21.551 --> 00:06:23.596
that were found out here,
so it's really cool.

00:06:23.596 --> 00:06:24.876
- Really cool.

00:06:24.876 --> 00:06:25.796
We're bravin' the heat,

00:06:25.796 --> 00:06:26.591
and ...

00:06:26.591 --> 00:06:27.590
- We're gonna see some animals.

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:28.838
- Yeah, we're really
excited, it's so pretty.

00:06:28.838 --> 00:06:30.430
I just wanna take pictures of everything.

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:31.104
It's beautiful.

00:06:31.104 --> 00:06:32.965
- I wanna go see the cats.

00:06:32.965 --> 00:06:34.979
- Meow.
- Meow.

00:07:04.388 --> 00:07:05.588
- HI.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.964
We're coming upon the end

00:07:07.964 --> 00:07:09.265
of the adventure.

00:07:09.465 --> 00:07:10.889
- We've had so much fun in Tucson.

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:12.216
It's beautiful.

00:07:12.216 --> 00:07:15.565
- I've seen more nature in two days

00:07:15.887 --> 00:07:17.122
than I've seen in my entire life.

00:07:17.122 --> 00:07:18.274
There's people on that mountain.

00:07:18.274 --> 00:07:20.196
- So we're on Tucson mountain right now,

00:07:20.196 --> 00:07:21.442
I think.

00:07:21.442 --> 00:07:22.320
- It's Gates Pass.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:23.429
- Gates Pass is this area here.

00:07:23.429 --> 00:07:24.604
- Gates Pass or Gate Pass?

00:07:24.604 --> 00:07:25.656
- Gates Pass.

00:07:25.656 --> 00:07:26.945
Yes, because Thomas Gates

00:07:27.467 --> 00:07:28.265
discovered it.

00:07:28.265 --> 00:07:28.804
- That's right, Gates.

00:07:28.804 --> 00:07:31.162
I was reading the information.

00:07:31.162 --> 00:07:33.284
- It's so pretty up here
and this is supposed to be

00:07:33.284 --> 00:07:35.828
a really great place
to see the sunset, so.

00:07:35.828 --> 00:07:37.001
- We've been up here for
about an hour and a half.

00:07:37.001 --> 00:07:37.549
We're gonna wait another hour.

00:07:37.549 --> 00:07:39.346
- It's only been an hour.

00:07:39.346 --> 00:07:40.209
- Okay, an hour.

00:07:40.209 --> 00:07:41.585
We drove for half an hour to get here,

00:07:41.585 --> 00:07:42.581
but about an hour.

00:07:42.581 --> 00:07:45.198
- Hey, dedication, to see an epic sunset.

00:07:45.535 --> 00:07:47.000
- It's goin' down in about

00:07:47.876 --> 00:07:50.962
T minus, less than an hour.

00:07:50.962 --> 00:07:52.626
- Yep, so we're gonna let you guys

00:07:52.626 --> 00:07:55.134
see it, and we hope it's epic.
