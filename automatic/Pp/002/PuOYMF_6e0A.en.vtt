 yes 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:24.230
 hello everyone welcome to my channel and now 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:28.150

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:30.910
 finally I bring you the new top houses 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.579

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.650
 How cool this little sign will be taught 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:37.829
 to do things of these in the next 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.320
 7 tutorial 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.620
 and good the term to deliver the houses 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.310
 for the 'top is until April 1 , 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.980
 2013 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:51.490
 let's go from today I'm going to upload the video 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:53.540
 you have a month exactly to send it 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:55.410
 to home 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.510
 obviously to marry that is made 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.990
 for you it is not worth to take one of google and 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.110
 upload it 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:04.600
 in the previous one you touch the top that was all 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.580
 castles there was a castle that was not 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.050
 done by the one who was and inside the top 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.030
 this time we are going to make sure very much 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.030
 more that there are no copies 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.840
 and that he can not have participated in 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:18.240
 other tops because if it would not be a copy 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.430
 from another top so he has participated in 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.960
 other everything to make another house or not 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.880
 can participate 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.820
 now the end of the video I will leave you a 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.640
 How to send me the house tutorial 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.560
 that you do not know and I comment a bit like 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.860
 let's assess the document now for 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.970
 that country and do the house according to 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.010
 that 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.770
 what we do is a table 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:44.800
 excel and there we put the notes that we are going 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.290
 putting in different categories to the 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.480
 house the different categories are the 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.670
 outer appearance you when you get to 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:54.640
 the house how beautiful it is outside the 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.910
 interior appearance that is the same but 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.400
 that inside the functionality is beautiful 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.740
 here all the rest is put though 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.140
 have beds and others can be a house 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.979
 of milk and then have neither beds nor 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.899
 deaf or anything and serve us to live 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.730
 and the use of the land will only count 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.230
 as a plus does not go will not do half 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.330
 with the rest as in another stop because 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.940
 many of the houses are very good but 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.290
 they are on the map and extra planes so 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.950
 this time what we are going to do is going to be 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.620
 whoever uses the land well will have a 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.100
 plus we'll see how we do it but not 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.260
 will do half 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.810
 and that would be what we had a table of 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.780
 excel would give us the medias and in the order 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.819
 that must enter the 'top 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.730
 to see if it can be a top 10 I hope that 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:42.740
 you send many houses because I have not done 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.110
 nothing from the top and you know you are sending 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.000
 so I hope you send now 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.400
 thorax that you have the ones that you have 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.590
 sent before houses you will send again 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.080
 because surely it has been lost between 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.850
 the messages because I do not download them 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.060
 and that you already know from now on you have 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.950
 you can start sending so I leave you 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.480
 now with a little tutorial on how 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.480
 send me the house 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:17.720
 send me your house is very simple 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:20.440
 you have to go to percentage to pepe data 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.910
 percentage 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.280
 craig venter 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.860
 and here you find a folder that 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.710
 flame point minecraft you give it and inside 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:34.610
 from this one called save we enter 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:36.440
 here and here you have all the 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.590
 maps that you have 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:42.020
 for example I'm going to take this one that is the 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:45.110
 taught where the house was and the 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:48.420
 crankcase that then so can not you 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:51.180
 send because no mediafire does not accept it 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:54.510
 then you have to download win-win 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:57.810
 rare any compressor that you have 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.579
 and compress it for example with winrar 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.950
 dais will add mute house 'I do not know what 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:04.780
 point rar you give 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.960
 and it is compressed as you see we have it 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:10.319
 here already compressed 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:13.909
 then do not have tablet 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:13.909
 you enter mediafire 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.919
 you can use any server and I usually 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.400
 recommend mediafire because to me it is the 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:26.930
 what I like the most 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.930
 then here you see it 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:33.280
 and once you have logged in and if not 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.660
 you have registered accounts is very 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.180
 simple I will not put to explain how 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:39.280
 register on a page 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:42.180
 but its bis 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:45.310
 for that is a blog here 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:47.889
 roger computer 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.659
 and I'll load this 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:52.110
 here drag that file we have 

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:52.110
 compressed 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.250
 and it's here begin hublot 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:02.160
 and what will start it will start to go up 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:07.210
 As you can see, it takes me a long time 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:11.100
 because I have a bad internet so 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.100
 short and I show you when it's finished 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.610
 here as you see already finished and climb 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.810
 that all you have to do is 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:21.230
 give copi link 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:22.900
 and so the link has already been copied 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:26.550
 download it 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.550
 then you go to youtube 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.670
 you go here to the inbox 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:41.630
 and you give to write new message 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:44.569
 you write for iker garcÃ­a 1996 issue 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:48.909
 top houses 

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:52.440
 and here you put if you enter the top houses 

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:54.570
 because the name that discs call 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.820
 Well, the name of our channel 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:58.370
 real name as you want me to call you if 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:01.660
 you enter 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:01.660
 the link to your channel 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:08.260
 also in case you enter I will place it for 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:10.500
 do some advertising to your 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.500
 channel 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:15.220
 and you place the download link 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:18.969
 what do you have copied from 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:22.809
 mediafire 

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:24.790
 you stick it here and as you can see, it's copy 

00:06:22.809 --> 00:06:28.330
 link 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:30.810
 and finally, here you can place a 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.810
 description 

00:06:34.249 --> 00:06:38.719
 It is optional if you do not want to put ourselves 

00:06:36.379 --> 00:06:41.719
 place but good comes well to be 

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:45.739
 more or less as is the house before you can 

00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:48.569
 send if you want photos a video or 

00:06:45.739 --> 00:06:51.149
 leave text alone 

00:06:48.569 --> 00:06:55.050
 If you send a picture, it comes from 

00:06:51.149 --> 00:06:57.810
 because that's how we see the house 

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:59.610
 and well with this I would be stuffed 

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:01.949
 of aysa send message and I get to 

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:05.280
 me and I kept a folder and all 

00:07:01.949 --> 00:07:07.560
 I will open them when the deadline 

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:10.250
 and this is all 

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.250
 goodbye
