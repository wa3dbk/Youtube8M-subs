defensive and also he must be running

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:21.020

close<00:03:19.590> to<00:03:19.709> marks<00:03:19.949> attack<00:03:20.220> because<00:03:20.519> I<00:03:20.549> did<00:03:21.000> not

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
close to marks attack because I did not

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.360 
close to marks attack because I did not
expect<00:03:21.359> that<00:03:21.660> say<00:03:21.930> meow<00:03:22.139> whatsoever<00:03:22.590> really

expect that say meow whatsoever really

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.369 
expect that say meow whatsoever really
didn't<00:03:23.639> but<00:03:23.819> it<00:03:23.879> does<00:03:24.209> it<00:03:24.419> kills<00:03:24.599> Rotom<00:03:24.989> so

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:25.379 
didn't but it does it kills Rotom so

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:26.960 
didn't but it does it kills Rotom so
that<00:03:25.470> kind<00:03:25.560> of<00:03:25.680> sucks<00:03:25.919> but<00:03:26.250> I<00:03:26.459> do<00:03:26.519> obviously

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
that kind of sucks but I do obviously

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.309 
that kind of sucks but I do obviously
have<00:03:27.150> landorus<00:03:27.569> here<00:03:27.780> who<00:03:27.870> can<00:03:27.989> thread<00:03:28.199> them

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
have landorus here who can thread them

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:29.930 
have landorus here who can thread them
out<00:03:28.410> with<00:03:28.530> the<00:03:28.620> earthquake<00:03:29.010> I<00:03:29.220> don't<00:03:29.639> think<00:03:29.879> I

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
out with the earthquake I don't think I

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.129 
out with the earthquake I don't think I
go<00:03:30.090> for<00:03:30.209> the<00:03:30.239> earthquake<00:03:30.629> I<00:03:30.780> go<00:03:30.959> for<00:03:31.049> the

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:31.139 
go for the earthquake I go for the

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:33.379 
go for the earthquake I go for the
Stealth<00:03:31.440> Rock<00:03:31.560> probably<00:03:32.430> because<00:03:32.849> he<00:03:33.299> has

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:33.389 
Stealth Rock probably because he has

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:35.569 
Stealth Rock probably because he has
gyarados<00:03:33.780> and<00:03:33.989> staraptor<00:03:34.260> on<00:03:34.709> his<00:03:34.829> team<00:03:35.010> which

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
gyarados and staraptor on his team which

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:38.210 
gyarados and staraptor on his team which
kind<00:03:35.879> of<00:03:36.269> makes<00:03:37.019> my<00:03:37.290> job<00:03:37.440> a<00:03:37.500> lot<00:03:37.650> easier<00:03:37.709> as

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
kind of makes my job a lot easier as

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.470 
kind of makes my job a lot easier as
long<00:03:38.370> as<00:03:38.459> I<00:03:38.519> gathers<00:03:38.790> down<00:03:38.940> the<00:03:39.090> field<00:03:39.269> doesn't

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
long as I gathers down the field doesn't

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.170 
long as I gathers down the field doesn't
look<00:03:39.629> like<00:03:39.750> as<00:03:39.900> a<00:03:39.930> spinner<00:03:40.230> anyway<00:03:40.560> so<00:03:40.620> I<00:03:40.799> work

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
look like as a spinner anyway so I work

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.180 
look like as a spinner anyway so I work
and<00:03:42.180> now<00:03:42.449> I<00:03:42.480> don't<00:03:42.900> want<00:03:43.260> to<00:03:43.410> take<00:03:43.590> any<00:03:43.859> kind<00:03:44.069> of

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
and now I don't want to take any kind of

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.500 
and now I don't want to take any kind of
hit<00:03:44.370> from<00:03:44.549> the<00:03:44.609> star<00:03:44.879> apt<00:03:45.030> I<00:03:45.120> don't<00:03:45.269> know<00:03:45.329> what

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
hit from the star apt I don't know what

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.420 
hit from the star apt I don't know what
type<00:03:45.959> of<00:03:45.989> star<00:03:46.290> up<00:03:46.440> he's<00:03:46.620> running<00:03:46.919> could<00:03:47.340> be

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
type of star up he's running could be

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.729 
type of star up he's running could be
banded<00:03:47.970> which<00:03:48.209> I'd<00:03:48.780> be<00:03:48.840> able<00:03:49.079> to<00:03:49.139> outspeed<00:03:49.500> and

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
banded which I'd be able to outspeed and

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.259 
banded which I'd be able to outspeed and
go<00:03:49.829> for<00:03:49.949> the<00:03:49.980> HP<00:03:50.190> Ison<00:03:50.639> but<00:03:50.819> it<00:03:50.910> wouldn't<00:03:51.120> kill

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
go for the HP Ison but it wouldn't kill

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.780 
go for the HP Ison but it wouldn't kill
him<00:03:51.449> but<00:03:52.260> most<00:03:52.560> likely<00:03:52.650> scarfed<00:03:53.220> and<00:03:53.430> I<00:03:53.579> don't

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
him but most likely scarfed and I don't

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.129 
him but most likely scarfed and I don't
want<00:03:53.910> to<00:03:54.000> take<00:03:54.120> a<00:03:54.150> hit<00:03:54.359> from<00:03:54.480> it<00:03:54.660> and<00:03:54.810> he

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:55.139 
want to take a hit from it and he

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:56.809 
want to take a hit from it and he
actually<00:03:55.199> goes<00:03:55.440> for<00:03:55.590> the<00:03:55.680> u-turn<00:03:55.949> which<00:03:56.190> you

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
actually goes for the u-turn which you

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:58.970 
actually goes for the u-turn which you
know<00:03:56.940> that<00:03:57.090> works<00:03:57.269> out<00:03:57.449> nicely<00:03:57.510> because<00:03:58.079> i<00:03:58.590> get

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
know that works out nicely because i get

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.589 
know that works out nicely because i get
to<00:03:59.010> death<00:03:59.250> fought<00:03:59.459> a<00:03:59.489> fortress<00:03:59.970> and<00:04:00.299> i<00:04:00.389> also

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 
to death fought a fortress and i also

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:03.860 
to death fought a fortress and i also
gets<00:04:00.959> which<00:04:01.139> advantage<00:04:01.650> so<00:04:02.269> good<00:04:03.269> i<00:04:03.480> mean<00:04:03.720> it

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
gets which advantage so good i mean it

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.039 
gets which advantage so good i mean it
works<00:04:04.049> in<00:04:04.379> the<00:04:04.560> end<00:04:04.769> and<00:04:05.340> things<00:04:05.849> happen<00:04:06.389> and

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
works in the end and things happen and

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:08.869 
works in the end and things happen and
i'll<00:04:07.199> go<00:04:07.379> to<00:04:07.440> giggle<00:04:07.799> if<00:04:07.919> I'm<00:04:08.250> giggling

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 
i'll go to giggle if I'm giggling

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:11.360 
i'll go to giggle if I'm giggling
giggling<00:04:09.419> giggling<00:04:09.750> legally<00:04:10.530> is<00:04:10.769> now<00:04:10.919> really

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
giggling giggling legally is now really

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.610 
giggling giggling legally is now really
down<00:04:11.639> low<00:04:11.909> on<00:04:11.970> the<00:04:12.060> health<00:04:12.269> HP<00:04:12.780> bar<00:04:13.229> cause

spikes on stealth rock I'm thinking he's

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:16.969 
spikes on stealth rock I'm thinking he's

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
probably not going to save it at this

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:18.439 
probably not going to save it at this

predicting<00:04:18.900> and<00:04:19.139> I'm<00:04:19.199> just<00:04:19.470> going<00:04:19.620> to<00:04:19.650> go<00:04:19.769> for

predicting and I'm just going to go for

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.170 
predicting and I'm just going to go for
the<00:04:19.949> earthquake<00:04:20.489> if<00:04:20.699> he<00:04:20.789> wants<00:04:21.000> to<00:04:21.030> go<00:04:21.150> into

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
the earthquake if he wants to go into

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.409 
the earthquake if he wants to go into
star<00:04:21.510> app<00:04:21.690> drag<00:04:21.870> arrows<00:04:22.260> fine<00:04:22.710> but<00:04:23.130> I<00:04:23.419> didn't

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
star app drag arrows fine but I didn't

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.149 
star app drag arrows fine but I didn't
really<00:04:24.539> think<00:04:24.780> that<00:04:25.320> he<00:04:25.500> would<00:04:25.650> cuz<00:04:25.979> the

00:04:26.149 --> 00:04:26.159 
really think that he would cuz the

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:27.170 
really think that he would cuz the
threat<00:04:26.430> of<00:04:26.460> some

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
threat of some

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.939 
threat of some
the<00:04:27.300> move<00:04:27.479> like<00:04:27.780> stone<00:04:28.050> edge<00:04:28.229> from<00:04:28.440> Landorus

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:28.949 
the move like stone edge from Landorus

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:30.770 
the move like stone edge from Landorus
was<00:04:29.190> probably<00:04:29.490> too<00:04:29.669> big<00:04:29.880> for<00:04:30.090> him<00:04:30.210> to<00:04:30.389> risk

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
was probably too big for him to risk

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.020 
was probably too big for him to risk
that<00:04:30.990> so<00:04:31.320> he<00:04:31.650> stays<00:04:31.860> in<00:04:32.009> dies<00:04:32.190> goes<00:04:32.850> into

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030
