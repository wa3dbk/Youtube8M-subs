00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
so obviously it's necessary I don't know

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:23.979 
so obviously it's necessary I don't know
what<00:02:21.920> kind<00:02:22.129> of<00:02:22.159> seal<00:02:22.340> it's<00:02:22.489> made<00:02:22.640> out<00:02:22.819> of<00:02:22.989> very

nice<00:02:24.290> and<00:02:24.560> effective<00:02:25.069> jumping<00:02:25.610> that<00:02:25.819> actually

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
nice and effective jumping that actually

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.460 
nice and effective jumping that actually
works<00:02:26.799> right<00:02:27.799> here<00:02:28.099> when<00:02:29.030> you<00:02:29.209> hold<00:02:29.420> it<00:02:29.629> it<00:02:30.260> is

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
works right here when you hold it it is

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.119 
works right here when you hold it it is
such<00:02:31.280> a<00:02:31.580> nice<00:02:32.209> knife<00:02:33.200> to<00:02:33.529> hold<00:02:33.709> news

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:34.129 
such a nice knife to hold news

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:36.759 
such a nice knife to hold news
especially<00:02:34.969> for<00:02:35.450> splitting<00:02:36.049> wood<00:02:36.260> you<00:02:36.409> put<00:02:36.620> on

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
especially for splitting wood you put on

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:37.210 
especially for splitting wood you put on
there

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
there

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.850 
there
then<00:02:37.700> you<00:02:37.820> just<00:02:38.090> split<00:02:39.050> the<00:02:39.200> wood<00:02:39.320> and<00:02:39.740> it

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
then you just split the wood and it

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.070 
then you just split the wood and it
works<00:02:40.100> very<00:02:40.430> very<00:02:41.030> well<00:02:41.270> in<00:02:41.600> that<00:02:41.890> area<00:02:42.890> and

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
works very very well in that area and

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.490 
works very very well in that area and
unlike<00:02:45.080> the<00:02:45.110> buck<00:02:45.380> 119<00:02:45.620> special<00:02:46.780> this<00:02:47.780> I<00:02:48.110> think

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
unlike the buck 119 special this I think

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.820 
unlike the buck 119 special this I think
would<00:02:48.620> be<00:02:48.830> very<00:02:49.070> well<00:02:50.060> served<00:02:50.300> as<00:02:50.510> a<00:02:50.830> tactical

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
would be very well served as a tactical

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.600 
would be very well served as a tactical
use<00:02:52.070> knives<00:02:52.900> because<00:02:54.010> of<00:02:55.010> the<00:02:55.460> quick

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610
