that's what I do um
but<00:01:21.860> instead<00:01:22.250> of<00:01:22.310> using<00:01:22.490> back<00:01:22.880> you<00:01:23.180> could<00:01:24.610> say

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
but instead of using back you could say

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.240 
but instead of using back you could say
another<00:01:25.880> word<00:01:26.120> I<00:01:26.390> don't<00:01:26.690> know<00:01:26.780> just<00:01:27.470> whatever

another word I don't know just whatever

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.160

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.770 

but<00:01:32.770> I<00:01:34.350> also<00:01:35.350> wouldn't<00:01:35.979> recommend<00:01:36.370> doing<00:01:36.820> this

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
but I also wouldn't recommend doing this

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.510 
but I also wouldn't recommend doing this
get<00:01:38.560> over<00:01:39.479> with<00:01:40.479> horses<00:01:41.020> that<00:01:41.290> will<00:01:41.619> like<00:01:42.190> rear

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
get over with horses that will like rear

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.540 
get over with horses that will like rear
wrap<00:01:42.729> and<00:01:43.030> buck<00:01:43.240> because<00:01:43.920> see<00:01:44.920> she<00:01:45.159> doesn't

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
wrap and buck because see she doesn't

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.240 
wrap and buck because see she doesn't
like<00:01:45.700> this<00:01:46.170> but<00:01:47.170> I<00:01:47.200> do<00:01:47.320> it<00:01:47.590> with<00:01:47.770> her<00:01:47.920> anyway

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
like this but I do it with her anyway

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.490 
like this but I do it with her anyway
that<00:01:48.520> way<00:01:48.640> she<00:01:48.820> gets<00:01:48.850> used<00:01:49.210> to<00:01:49.420> it<00:01:49.450> and<00:01:50.259> she

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
that way she gets used to it and she

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.719 
that way she gets used to it and she
knows<00:01:50.680> that<00:01:50.710> I<00:01:51.009> won't<00:01:51.369> hit<00:01:51.580> her<00:01:51.670> with

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.209 

so<00:01:55.420> it's<00:01:55.630> just<00:01:55.750> the<00:01:55.930> same<00:01:55.960> with<00:01:56.259> it<00:01:56.469> like<00:01:56.799> if

00:01:57.209 --> 00:01:57.219 
so it's just the same with it like if

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:59.279 
so it's just the same with it like if
you<00:01:57.280> have<00:01:57.490> a<00:01:57.520> horse<00:01:57.850> that<00:01:58.060> will<00:01:58.210> wear<00:01:58.450> out<00:01:58.689> you

00:01:59.279 --> 00:01:59.289 
you have a horse that will wear out you

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:02.639 
you have a horse that will wear out you
don't<00:01:59.439> want<00:01:59.740> to<00:01:59.860> gank<00:02:00.070> on<00:02:00.280> that<00:02:01.470> because<00:02:02.470> that

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649 
don't want to gank on that because that

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:04.200 
don't want to gank on that because that
will<00:02:02.799> cause<00:02:02.950> them<00:02:03.220> to<00:02:03.430> pull<00:02:03.670> their<00:02:03.850> head<00:02:04.030> up

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
will cause them to pull their head up

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.539 
will cause them to pull their head up
what<00:02:04.869> you<00:02:05.020> might<00:02:05.200> want<00:02:05.409> to<00:02:05.470> do<00:02:05.619> is<00:02:05.860> just<00:02:06.189> hold

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
what you might want to do is just hold

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:12.990 
what you might want to do is just hold
it<00:02:06.850> like<00:02:07.090> this

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.940 

like<00:02:13.540> that<00:02:13.780> but<00:02:14.410> not<00:02:14.710> jump<00:02:15.280> it<00:02:16.170> just<00:02:17.170> hold<00:02:17.770> it

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
like that but not jump it just hold it

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:24.690 
like that but not jump it just hold it
back<00:02:18.100> that<00:02:19.000> might<00:02:19.240> be<00:02:19.330> another<00:02:19.630> option<00:02:20.970> but

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.570

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
everywhere but for this of course I will

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.080 
everywhere but for this of course I will
need<00:03:29.930> a<00:03:30.700> rope

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
need a rope

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
you know I could just do this but then

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:37.839 
you know I could just do this but then
that<00:03:36.739> wouldn't<00:03:37.069> really<00:03:37.190> teach<00:03:37.519> you<00:03:37.699> guys

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:37.849

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:42.280 
that wouldn't really teach you guys
anything<00:03:38.440> so<00:03:39.669> I'm<00:03:40.669> going<00:03:40.849> to<00:03:40.879> use<00:03:41.000> a<00:03:41.030> rope<00:03:41.840> for

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290

anything so I'm going to use a rope for
this<00:03:42.470> exercise<00:03:43.129> now<00:03:44.030> I<00:03:44.329> put<00:03:44.629> it<00:03:44.750> on<00:03:44.870> her<00:03:44.989> back

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
this exercise now I put it on her back

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.640 
this exercise now I put it on her back
just<00:03:46.970> for<00:03:47.329> this<00:03:47.480> because<00:03:47.930> she's<00:03:48.109> a<00:03:48.139> good<00:03:48.379> horse

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
just for this because she's a good horse

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:49.900 
just for this because she's a good horse
and<00:03:48.919> she<00:03:49.160> won't<00:03:49.310> do

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
and she won't do

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.930 
and she won't do
but<00:03:50.480> if<00:03:50.570> your<00:03:50.720> horse<00:03:50.870> is<00:03:51.700> knowledge<00:03:52.700> train

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
but if your horse is knowledge train

00:03:52.940 --> 00:04:00.650 
but if your horse is knowledge train
this<00:03:53.180> year<00:03:53.560> you<00:03:54.560> can<00:03:55.120> just<00:03:56.120> loop<00:03:56.690> it<00:03:57.190> like<00:03:58.190> this

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.200 

and<00:04:01.050> that<00:04:01.380> way<00:04:01.530> if<00:04:01.830> she<00:04:01.860> does<00:04:02.250> have<00:04:02.520> to<00:04:02.700> if<00:04:02.970> she

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:03.210 
and that way if she does have to if she

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.300 
and that way if she does have to if she
does<00:04:03.420> run<00:04:03.690> if<00:04:04.290> she<00:04:04.500> does<00:04:04.680> try<00:04:04.830> to<00:04:04.890> get<00:04:05.100> away<00:04:05.190> you

go back back back sometimes that works

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:33.820 
go back back back sometimes that works
better<00:05:30.969> but<00:05:31.969> on<00:05:32.120> some<00:05:32.360> horses<00:05:32.629> this<00:05:33.199> now<00:05:33.590> still
