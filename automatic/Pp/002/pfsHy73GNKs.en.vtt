us and today I'm going to shoot some
water<00:00:10.660> drops<00:00:10.990> and<00:00:11.350> so<00:00:12.010> I'm<00:00:12.760> gonna<00:00:12.910> show<00:00:13.150> you

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:13.180 
water drops and so I'm gonna show you

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:19.320 
water drops and so I'm gonna show you
how<00:00:13.570> to<00:00:13.630> turn<00:00:13.990> this<00:00:15.450> combined<00:00:16.450> with<00:00:16.540> this<00:00:18.330> into

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:19.330 
how to turn this combined with this into

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:25.440 
how to turn this combined with this into
this

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:25.450 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.440 

okay<00:00:26.450> to<00:00:26.510> do<00:00:26.960> this<00:00:27.200> I'm<00:00:27.800> going<00:00:28.220> to<00:00:28.550> use<00:00:28.640> with<00:00:29.000> 7d

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:29.450 
okay to do this I'm going to use with 7d

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.490 
okay to do this I'm going to use with 7d
again<00:00:30.440> I<00:00:30.590> picked<00:00:30.860> 7d<00:00:31.490> because<00:00:32.000> it<00:00:32.570> has<00:00:33.110> the

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
again I picked 7d because it has the

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.760 
again I picked 7d because it has the
built-in<00:00:33.950> flash<00:00:34.190> controller<00:00:34.820> for<00:00:35.660> my<00:00:35.750> 580<00:00:36.260> X

built-in flash controller for my 580 X
to<00:00:38.680> any<00:00:39.680> camera<00:00:40.040> body<00:00:40.250> would<00:00:40.489> work<00:00:40.730> as<00:00:40.970> long<00:00:41.030> as

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:41.330 
to any camera body would work as long as

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.610 
to any camera body would work as long as
you<00:00:41.390> can<00:00:41.540> do<00:00:41.920> manual<00:00:43.390> we<00:00:44.390> need<00:00:44.660> everything<00:00:45.350> in

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
you can do manual we need everything in

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.060 
you can do manual we need everything in

manual aperture shutter speed ISO and
focus<00:00:50.230> today<00:00:51.230> I'm<00:00:51.350> also<00:00:51.530> using<00:00:51.770> my<00:00:52.309> macro<00:00:53.120> lens

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
focus today I'm also using my macro lens

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.920 
focus today I'm also using my macro lens
the<00:00:53.720> 100<00:00:54.410> millimeter<00:00:54.800> and<00:00:55.449> I<00:00:56.449> picked<00:00:56.780> this

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
the 100 millimeter and I picked this

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.799 
the 100 millimeter and I picked this
lens<00:00:57.280> because<00:00:58.280> as<00:00:58.640> well<00:00:59.089> as<00:00:59.210> my<00:00:59.420> favorite

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
lens because as well as my favorite

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.890 
lens because as well as my favorite
macro<00:01:00.350> lens<00:01:00.589> way<00:01:01.550> of<00:01:01.670> shooting<00:01:01.850> water<00:01:02.210> drops<00:01:02.629> a

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:02.900 
macro lens way of shooting water drops a

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.750 
macro lens way of shooting water drops a
macro<00:01:03.470> lens<00:01:03.739> really<00:01:05.050> helps<00:01:06.050> I<00:01:06.170> mean<00:01:06.350> you<00:01:06.470> could

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:06.760 
macro lens really helps I mean you could

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.649 
macro lens really helps I mean you could
probably<00:01:07.760> get<00:01:08.630> away<00:01:08.780> with<00:01:09.159> telephoto<00:01:10.659> but

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
probably get away with telephoto but

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:13.690 
probably get away with telephoto but
then<00:01:11.900> you'd<00:01:12.140> have<00:01:12.170> to<00:01:12.350> stand<00:01:12.710> pretty<00:01:13.190> far<00:01:13.460> back

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
then you'd have to stand pretty far back

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.080 
then you'd have to stand pretty far back
away<00:01:14.200> the<00:01:15.200> reason<00:01:15.590> is<00:01:16.010> your<00:01:16.400> your<00:01:16.700> depth<00:01:16.970> of

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
away the reason is your your depth of

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.539 
away the reason is your your depth of
field<00:01:17.150> in<00:01:17.690> your<00:01:18.049> how<00:01:18.500> close<00:01:18.890> you<00:01:19.190> can<00:01:19.340> get<00:01:19.490> to

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
field in your how close you can get to

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:25.030 
field in your how close you can get to
the<00:01:20.210> water<00:01:20.420> now<00:01:22.120> the<00:01:23.120> 7d<00:01:23.810> is<00:01:24.170> crop<00:01:24.770> factor

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
the water now the 7d is crop factor

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.070 
the water now the 7d is crop factor
sensor<00:01:25.640> on<00:01:25.790> it<00:01:25.820> so<00:01:26.180> there<00:01:26.450> is<00:01:26.570> a<00:01:26.600> crop<00:01:26.870> factor

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
sensor on it so there is a crop factor

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.219 
sensor on it so there is a crop factor
of<00:01:27.530> a<00:01:27.920> one<00:01:28.100> point<00:01:28.280> six<00:01:28.750> so<00:01:29.750> this<00:01:29.930> 100

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
of a one point six so this 100

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.740 
of a one point six so this 100
millimeter<00:01:30.619> lens<00:01:30.920> is<00:01:31.250> actually<00:01:31.600> has<00:01:32.600> an

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
millimeter lens is actually has an

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.350 
millimeter lens is actually has an
effective<00:01:33.380> focal<00:01:34.189> length<00:01:34.549> of<00:01:34.729> 160

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
effective focal length of 160

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.620 
effective focal length of 160
millimeters<00:01:36.259> on<00:01:36.469> this<00:01:36.740> camera<00:01:37.329> so<00:01:38.329> the

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
millimeters on this camera so the

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:44.490 
millimeters on this camera so the
combination<00:01:39.439> of<00:01:41.049> let's<00:01:42.049> take<00:01:42.619> a<00:01:42.649> step<00:01:42.890> back

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
combination of let's take a step back

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.020 
combination of let's take a step back
this<00:01:45.500> is<00:01:45.680> my<00:01:45.710> water<00:01:46.039> tank<00:01:46.369> and<00:01:46.490> gonna<00:01:46.670> drop<00:01:46.880> the

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
this is my water tank and gonna drop the

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.219 
this is my water tank and gonna drop the
water<00:01:47.240> into<00:01:47.829> this<00:01:48.829> is<00:01:49.039> three<00:01:49.460> inches<00:01:49.899> now<00:01:50.899> I

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
water into this is three inches now I

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:54.399 
water into this is three inches now I
need<00:01:51.799> a<00:01:51.829> depth<00:01:52.159> of<00:01:52.369> field<00:01:52.640> to<00:01:53.030> cover<00:01:53.359> most<00:01:54.079> of

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
need a depth of field to cover most of

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:57.099 
need a depth of field to cover most of
this<00:01:54.590> three<00:01:55.250> inches<00:01:55.700> to<00:01:56.210> get<00:01:56.390> the<00:01:56.539> whole<00:01:56.750> water

00:01:57.099 --> 00:01:57.109 
this three inches to get the whole water

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:02.440 
this three inches to get the whole water
drop<00:01:57.500> and<00:01:57.829> focus<00:01:58.659> so<00:01:59.659> I<00:02:00.789> picked<00:02:01.789> an<00:02:01.880> f-stop<00:02:02.149> of

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
drop and focus so I picked an f-stop of

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:08.859 
drop and focus so I picked an f-stop of
f11<00:02:03.039> because<00:02:04.570> this<00:02:05.570> lens<00:02:06.530> has<00:02:07.070> a<00:02:07.609> f-stop<00:02:08.539> range

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
f11 because this lens has a f-stop range

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.230 
f11 because this lens has a f-stop range
of<00:02:09.200> 2.8<00:02:09.830> to<00:02:10.369> F<00:02:10.729> 32<00:02:12.400> f11<00:02:13.400> is<00:02:13.520> in<00:02:13.670> the<00:02:13.790> middle<00:02:14.060> so

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
of 2.8 to F 32 f11 is in the middle so

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.290 
of 2.8 to F 32 f11 is in the middle so
it's<00:02:14.390> an<00:02:14.480> 8<00:02:14.630> stop<00:02:14.930> range<00:02:15.640> f11<00:02:16.640> is<00:02:16.730> four<00:02:17.000> stops

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
it's an 8 stop range f11 is four stops

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.600 
it's an 8 stop range f11 is four stops
up<00:02:17.570> so<00:02:18.530> that<00:02:18.770> one<00:02:18.950> should<00:02:18.980> give<00:02:19.460> me<00:02:19.580> the

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
up so that one should give me the

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.559 
up so that one should give me the
sharpest<00:02:20.180> image<00:02:20.600> out<00:02:20.840> of<00:02:20.900> this<00:02:21.500> lens<00:02:22.060> so<00:02:23.060> to

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
sharpest image out of this lens so to

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:28.420 
sharpest image out of this lens so to
get<00:02:23.900> a<00:02:24.880> depth<00:02:25.880> of<00:02:26.030> field<00:02:26.360> of<00:02:27.430> one-and-a-half

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
get a depth of field of one-and-a-half

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.070 
get a depth of field of one-and-a-half
inches<00:02:28.819> because<00:02:29.000> that's<00:02:29.090> what<00:02:29.630> I'm<00:02:29.720> gonna<00:02:29.870> end

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
inches because that's what I'm gonna end

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.830 
inches because that's what I'm gonna end
up<00:02:30.290> with<00:02:30.530> I<00:02:30.800> have<00:02:31.460> to<00:02:31.700> set<00:02:31.940> my<00:02:32.090> camera<00:02:32.300> three

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
up with I have to set my camera three

up with I have to set my camera three
feet<00:02:33.110> away<00:02:33.380> from<00:02:33.830> the<00:02:34.340> water<00:02:34.610> have<00:02:35.570> my<00:02:35.840> shutter

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
feet away from the water have my shutter

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.240 
feet away from the water have my shutter
speed<00:02:36.170> at

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
speed at

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.300

while the chair speed will be at 125 but

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.390 
while the chair speed will be at 125 but
that<00:02:41.080> is<00:02:42.080> no<00:02:42.260> difference<00:02:42.710> for<00:02:42.890> the<00:02:43.040> depth<00:02:43.250> of

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
that is no difference for the depth of

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.600 
that is no difference for the depth of
field<00:02:43.610> but<00:02:43.850> the<00:02:43.940> f-stop<00:02:44.420> will<00:02:44.600> be<00:02:44.720> at<00:02:44.870> f/11

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
field but the f-stop will be at f/11

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.050 
field but the f-stop will be at f/11
also<00:02:46.610> my<00:02:46.730> ISO<00:02:47.290> will<00:02:48.290> be<00:02:48.440> at<00:02:48.620> a<00:02:48.650> hundred<00:02:49.060> so

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
also my ISO will be at a hundred so

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.680 
also my ISO will be at a hundred so
anyway

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
anyway

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:56.530 
anyway
oh<00:02:50.720> and<00:02:51.320> of<00:02:51.440> course<00:02:51.910> off<00:02:52.910> of<00:02:53.780> camera<00:02:55.540> shutter

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
oh and of course off of camera shutter

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.320 
oh and of course off of camera shutter
release<00:02:56.930> and<00:02:57.440> I<00:02:58.160> will<00:02:58.400> work<00:02:58.760> it<00:02:58.910> using<00:02:59.240> my

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
release and I will work it using my

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.010 
release and I will work it using my
tripod<00:02:59.950> so<00:03:01.270> that's<00:03:02.270> enough<00:03:02.510> for<00:03:02.660> the<00:03:02.750> gear

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
tripod so that's enough for the gear

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:12.310 
tripod so that's enough for the gear
let's<00:03:03.440> actually<00:03:03.650> get<00:03:04.190> started<00:03:04.640> I<00:03:10.840> have<00:03:11.840> a<00:03:11.870> bag

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
let's actually get started I have a bag

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.000 
let's actually get started I have a bag
with<00:03:12.920> a<00:03:13.640> water<00:03:14.180> and<00:03:14.390> some<00:03:14.570> ice<00:03:14.780> hanging<00:03:15.680> from<00:03:15.860> a

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
with a water and some ice hanging from a

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.120 
with a water and some ice hanging from a
boom<00:03:16.310> above<00:03:17.270> my<00:03:17.630> water<00:03:18.170> tank<00:03:18.470> and<00:03:18.860> I<00:03:18.920> put<00:03:19.100> a

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
boom above my water tank and I put a

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.070 
boom above my water tank and I put a
very<00:03:19.190> small<00:03:19.820> hole<00:03:20.120> in<00:03:20.330> it<00:03:20.480> so<00:03:22.390> drops<00:03:23.390> are<00:03:23.780> very

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
very small hole in it so drops are very

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.110 
very small hole in it so drops are very
slowly<00:03:24.560> dropping<00:03:25.370> out<00:03:26.350> and<00:03:27.350> I<00:03:27.500> have<00:03:27.800> my<00:03:28.120> flash

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
slowly dropping out and I have my flash

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.580 
slowly dropping out and I have my flash
set<00:03:29.810> up<00:03:30.020> on<00:03:30.290> a<00:03:30.800> magic<00:03:31.370> arm<00:03:31.870> against<00:03:32.870> bouncing

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
set up on a magic arm against bouncing

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.300 
set up on a magic arm against bouncing
off<00:03:33.800> that<00:03:33.830> white<00:03:34.640> background<00:03:36.070> now<00:03:37.070> I've<00:03:37.280> used

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
off that white background now I've used

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.690 
off that white background now I've used
a<00:03:37.850> custom<00:03:38.600> white<00:03:38.810> balance<00:03:38.840> when<00:03:39.560> I<00:03:39.590> set<00:03:40.190> up<00:03:40.220> the

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
a custom white balance when I set up the

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.560 
a custom white balance when I set up the
white<00:03:41.239> balance<00:03:42.130> but<00:03:43.130> to<00:03:43.550> get<00:03:43.760> a<00:03:43.790> nice<00:03:44.180> blue

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
white balance but to get a nice blue

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.310 
white balance but to get a nice blue
effect<00:03:45.440> on<00:03:45.739> the<00:03:46.100> sub<00:03:46.489> picture<00:03:47.330> what<00:03:47.989> you<00:03:48.110> can

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
effect on the sub picture what you can

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:53.680 
effect on the sub picture what you can
do<00:03:48.470> is<00:03:48.739> change<00:03:49.130> it<00:03:49.720> to<00:03:50.720> a<00:03:51.910> tungsten<00:03:52.910> white

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
do is change it to a tungsten white

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.320 
do is change it to a tungsten white
balance<00:03:54.200> so<00:03:54.980> when<00:03:55.190> I<00:03:55.220> go<00:03:55.489> ahead<00:03:55.519> and<00:03:55.790> do<00:03:56.150> that

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330 
balance so when I go ahead and do that

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:04.930 
balance so when I go ahead and do that
right<00:03:56.600> now<00:03:56.630> and<00:03:58.000> you<00:03:59.000> can<00:03:59.570> see

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.520 

the<00:04:05.510> difference<00:04:06.020> it<00:04:06.620> should<00:04:06.980> give<00:04:07.220> it<00:04:07.340> a<00:04:07.490> nice

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
the difference it should give it a nice

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:16.870 
the difference it should give it a nice
blue<00:04:09.530> a<00:04:13.150> little<00:04:14.150> bit<00:04:14.390> of<00:04:14.480> a<00:04:14.600> blue<00:04:15.110> hint<00:04:15.760> to<00:04:16.760> the

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
blue a little bit of a blue hint to the

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.939 
blue a little bit of a blue hint to the
picture

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:21.949 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:26.640 

and<00:04:22.490> I<00:04:22.819> have<00:04:23.780> the<00:04:24.349> shutter<00:04:24.860> speed<00:04:25.039> set<00:04:25.550> at<00:04:25.789> 125

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
and I have the shutter speed set at 125

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.429 
and I have the shutter speed set at 125
now<00:04:27.650> the<00:04:27.710> reason<00:04:28.249> I<00:04:28.340> used<00:04:28.610> 125<00:04:29.569> is<00:04:30.050> that's

00:04:30.429 --> 00:04:30.439 
now the reason I used 125 is that's

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:32.559 
now the reason I used 125 is that's
normally<00:04:31.009> the<00:04:31.159> shutter<00:04:31.370> speed<00:04:31.580> that<00:04:32.060> I<00:04:32.090> use

00:04:32.559 --> 00:04:32.569 
normally the shutter speed that I use

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:35.080 
normally the shutter speed that I use
when<00:04:33.259> I'm<00:04:33.379> using<00:04:33.620> my<00:04:33.860> studio<00:04:34.219> strobes<00:04:34.729> and

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
when I'm using my studio strobes and

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:40.029 
when I'm using my studio strobes and
really<00:04:35.960> any<00:04:36.319> shutter<00:04:36.740> speed<00:04:37.159> under<00:04:38.150> the<00:04:39.050> sync

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:40.039 
really any shutter speed under the sync

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:42.219 
really any shutter speed under the sync
speed<00:04:40.310> of<00:04:40.520> your<00:04:40.639> camera<00:04:41.090> is<00:04:41.629> all<00:04:41.930> that<00:04:42.110> you

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:42.229 
speed of your camera is all that you

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:44.290 
speed of your camera is all that you
need<00:04:42.259> because<00:04:42.949> it's<00:04:43.099> not<00:04:43.400> the<00:04:43.759> shutter<00:04:44.090> speed

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
need because it's not the shutter speed

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.230 
need because it's not the shutter speed
that's<00:04:45.020> freezing<00:04:45.379> the<00:04:45.680> action<00:04:46.189> it's<00:04:46.789> the

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
that's freezing the action it's the

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.640 
that's freezing the action it's the
flash<00:04:48.020> duration<00:04:48.789> that's<00:04:50.020> freezing<00:04:51.020> the

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
flash duration that's freezing the

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.170 
flash duration that's freezing the
action<00:04:52.129> and<00:04:52.370> that's<00:04:52.999> why<00:04:53.539> a<00:04:54.580> speed<00:04:55.580> light<00:04:55.759> is

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
action and that's why a speed light is

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.480 
action and that's why a speed light is
better<00:04:56.569> than<00:04:56.930> a<00:04:56.960> studio<00:04:57.529> strobe<00:04:57.919> for<00:04:58.310> this

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
better than a studio strobe for this

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.640 
better than a studio strobe for this
because<00:04:59.000> a<00:04:59.029> speed<00:04:59.509> light<00:04:59.719> has<00:05:00.020> a<00:05:00.050> shorter

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
because a speed light has a shorter

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.089 
because a speed light has a shorter
flash<00:05:01.490> duration<00:05:02.210> to<00:05:02.779> freeze<00:05:03.139> that<00:05:03.409> action

00:05:04.089 --> 00:05:04.099 
flash duration to freeze that action

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:08.279 
flash duration to freeze that action
I<00:05:04.210> used<00:05:05.210> my<00:05:05.389> focusing<00:05:06.020> target<00:05:06.529> to<00:05:06.919> set<00:05:07.189> my

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:08.289 
I used my focusing target to set my

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:12.730 
I used my focusing target to set my
white<00:05:09.289> balance<00:05:09.800> and<00:05:10.569> to<00:05:11.569> focus<00:05:12.289> the<00:05:12.710> camera

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
white balance and to focus the camera

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.019 
white balance and to focus the camera
normally<00:05:13.629> but<00:05:14.629> on<00:05:14.930> this<00:05:15.439> particular<00:05:15.979> setup<00:05:16.610> I

00:05:17.019 --> 00:05:17.029 
normally but on this particular setup I

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:20.379 
normally but on this particular setup I
only<00:05:17.659> use<00:05:18.139> that<00:05:18.560> to<00:05:19.310> set<00:05:19.699> my<00:05:19.909> white<00:05:20.150> balance

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:20.389 
only use that to set my white balance

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:26.649 
only use that to set my white balance
and<00:05:21.400> I<00:05:22.400> use<00:05:22.699> a<00:05:22.969> metal<00:05:23.300> rod<00:05:23.800> connect<00:05:24.800> it<00:05:25.089> to<00:05:26.089> my

00:05:26.649 --> 00:05:26.659 
and I use a metal rod connect it to my

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:29.619 
and I use a metal rod connect it to my
boom<00:05:26.960> arm<00:05:27.229> going<00:05:28.009> straight<00:05:28.430> down<00:05:28.460> into<00:05:29.389> my

00:05:29.619 --> 00:05:29.629 
boom arm going straight down into my

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:32.740 
boom arm going straight down into my
tank<00:05:30.080> and<00:05:30.349> I<00:05:31.039> focused<00:05:31.580> on<00:05:31.789> that<00:05:32.089> spot<00:05:32.539> because

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
tank and I focused on that spot because

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.350 
tank and I focused on that spot because
that's<00:05:32.990> exactly<00:05:33.589> where<00:05:33.770> the<00:05:33.949> water<00:05:34.699> drops<00:05:35.060> are

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
that's exactly where the water drops are

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:42.970 
that's exactly where the water drops are
hitting

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:42.980 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:47.140 

I<00:05:43.930> want<00:05:44.930> to<00:05:45.050> show<00:05:45.260> you<00:05:45.320> the<00:05:46.030> settings<00:05:47.030> that

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150
