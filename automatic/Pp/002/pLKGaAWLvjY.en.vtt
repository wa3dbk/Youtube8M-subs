amounts there are large so they are

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
now about the younger kids i would like

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.850 
now about the younger kids i would like
to<00:01:54.000> actually<00:01:54.240> give<00:01:54.899> you<00:01:54.990> an<00:01:55.079> idea<00:01:55.170> of<00:01:55.590> using

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
to actually give you an idea of using

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.520 
to actually give you an idea of using
cards<00:01:56.460> because<00:01:56.729> i<00:01:57.000> use<00:01:57.390> cards<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.840> lot<00:01:57.990> right<00:01:58.320> so

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
cards because i use cards a lot right so

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.440 
cards because i use cards a lot right so
you<00:01:58.619> can<00:01:58.740> use<00:01:58.890> cards<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.939> only<00:02:00.270> desert

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
you can use cards the only desert

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.810 
you can use cards the only desert
disadvantage<00:02:01.320> is<00:02:01.469> that<00:02:01.500> cards<00:02:02.070> don't<00:02:02.670> have

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
disadvantage is that cards don't have

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.230 
disadvantage is that cards don't have
number<00:02:03.119> one<00:02:03.299> they<00:02:03.540> have<00:02:03.689> a<00:02:03.899> nice<00:02:04.170> right<00:02:04.619> so

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
number one they have a nice right so

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.710 
number one they have a nice right so
either<00:02:06.240> you<00:02:06.600> can<00:02:06.840> just<00:02:08.149> maybe<00:02:09.149> tell<00:02:09.569> the

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
either you can just maybe tell the

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.500 
either you can just maybe tell the
students<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.259> use<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:10.679> instead<00:02:11.099> one<00:02:11.370> or<00:02:11.640> simply

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
students to use it instead one or simply

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.710 
students to use it instead one or simply
don't<00:02:12.720> use<00:02:12.900> that<00:02:12.930> and

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
don't use that and

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.090 
don't use that and
you<00:02:13.750> basically<00:02:13.930> have<00:02:14.350> all<00:02:14.380> the<00:02:14.680> numbers<00:02:14.770> from

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
you basically have all the numbers from

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.780 
you basically have all the numbers from

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
multiple items not only like once they

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:40.500 
multiple items not only like once they
can<00:03:38.170> buy<00:03:38.290> for<00:03:38.350> example<00:03:38.890> I<00:03:39.010> don't<00:03:39.160> know<00:03:39.330> two<00:03:40.330> ice

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
can buy for example I don't know two ice

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.690 
can buy for example I don't know two ice
cream<00:03:40.810> if<00:03:41.470> they<00:03:41.709> want<00:03:41.920> right<00:03:42.489> were<00:03:42.850> five<00:03:43.600> bowls

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
cream if they want right were five bowls

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.880 
cream if they want right were five bowls
alright<00:03:45.700> so<00:03:46.120> the<00:03:46.690> points<00:03:47.140> that<00:03:47.290> they<00:03:47.350> receive

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
alright so the points that they receive

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.160 
alright so the points that they receive
are<00:03:48.160> actually<00:03:48.580> coming<00:03:48.760> from<00:03:48.910> here<00:03:49.540> not<00:03:49.959> the

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
are actually coming from here not the

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.830 
are actually coming from here not the
price<00:03:50.440> so<00:03:51.310> they<00:03:51.970> get<00:03:52.120> for<00:03:52.330> example<00:03:52.660> five

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
price so they get for example five

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.180 
price so they get for example five
points<00:03:53.230> and<00:03:53.430> now<00:03:54.510> you<00:03:55.510> don't<00:03:55.630> tell<00:03:55.989> them<00:03:56.230> what

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
points and now you don't tell them what

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.979 
points and now you don't tell them what
is<00:03:57.310> the<00:03:57.640> what<00:03:57.910> is<00:03:57.940> the<00:03:58.120> point<00:03:58.299> of<00:03:58.450> the<00:03:58.600> game<00:03:58.630> you

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
is the what is the point of the game you

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:00.570 
is the what is the point of the game you
tell<00:03:59.140> them<00:03:59.200> what<00:03:59.530> what<00:03:59.769> the<00:03:59.860> point<00:04:00.010> is<00:04:00.160> in<00:04:00.430> the

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
tell them what what the point is in the

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.560 
tell them what what the point is in the
end<00:04:00.760> when<00:04:01.510> you<00:04:01.630> actually<00:04:02.760> calculate<00:04:03.760> the

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
end when you actually calculate the

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.500 
end when you actually calculate the
total<00:04:04.750> and<00:04:05.549> the<00:04:06.549> point<00:04:06.760> of<00:04:06.850> the<00:04:06.970> game<00:04:07.000> is<00:04:07.180> that

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
total and the point of the game is that

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.560 
total and the point of the game is that
the<00:04:07.750> team<00:04:07.989> wins<00:04:08.440> if<00:04:08.739> they<00:04:09.160> have<00:04:09.400> of<00:04:09.760> course<00:04:10.360> a

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.570 
the team wins if they have of course a

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.410 
the team wins if they have of course a
higher<00:04:10.780> number<00:04:11.110> and<00:04:11.670> somewhere<00:04:12.670> you<00:04:13.000> can<00:04:13.180> see

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
higher number and somewhere you can see

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.880 
higher number and somewhere you can see
