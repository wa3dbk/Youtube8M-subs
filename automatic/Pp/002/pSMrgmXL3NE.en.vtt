00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.910
 hello everyone you epic and today we 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.790
 will play a game called 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:12.570
 silence he is over the line this game as always 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.500
 all so all good stamp we 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.199
 wake up 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.740
 get out a fig 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:22.439
 we are haunted we wake up incomprehensibly 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.100
 where itâ€™s definitely not clear to me where 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.460
 submarine 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.510
 and don't remember anything like this is a plot for 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.400
 any horror 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.590
 that we do not remember anything and we need 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.930
 collect items it is almost the same 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.570
 the very thing that slander is only here 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:42.120
 in my opinion there are several types of these 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:44.309
 ghosts and how to do it all in 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.180
 pixel graphics and here there is a thing 1 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.550
 he is in my season behind us like 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:53.850
 Nicholas appears whom you do not yell and not 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:59.489
 yell don't yell me even more annoying 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:03.539
 cry than you yourself I hear from people that 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:08.549
 this game is very very short 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:14.310
 that I don't know if she will be short and I 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:17.240
 Pike never not played it but 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:22.770
 I mean that so far I like about 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:26.030
 note for nick damn what is it what is it 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:30.930
 for the sound of who it is who voiced it 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:33.840
 straight cuts rumor this one here is some 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.270
 a crackle which was when some girl 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.909
 said fell I did not I did not meet here 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.189
 by the way not figs he runs after us he runs 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.630
 behind us 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:47.970
 he runs he runs runs see damn 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.979
 just just just keep quiet probably 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.320
 no, well, it's all for me to end now 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.320
 will be because I often guys are not here 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.630
 here's the thing thing and for sure you already understood 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:03.689
 I I do not remember telling you I say 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:07.290
 whether it is me or not but things are cleaning these 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:10.110
 here are the ghosts that appear but 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:14.940
 well, like ghosts and not just like we 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:16.710
 take them these things with me and they are so i don't 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:21.540
 I see bye here ghosts and these here 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:22.980
 things they kind of help us do so 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.790
 lest they come near 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:29.790
 give his ghosts to us or rather generally 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.070
 disappeared well because dead yes they don't 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.010
 want faces their past so 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.270
 I'm really, I'm afraid that scared 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.510
 somewhere in the shitty 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:44.160
 and I'll just scream about the key and that's what 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:46.890
 all nifiga she he appeared again she she 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.709
 here again everything appeared 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.360
 right all at once just not a cook 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.060
 please just don't cook 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:58.459
 because he runs after us and as if 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.459
 clogs with boom itself no no no no no 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:10.110
 and I can't why all this and I programs 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:12.450
 did he catch up with the end in my sky 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.700
 most likely the end because now 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:18.780
 probably there will be credits because 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.640
 shows the name of the game well, in general 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.570
 my impressions of this game remained 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:26.850
 only positive because how would that 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:30.630
 it was even a little funny when the cook for 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:32.850
 I was chasing and it seems to me that 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.590
 developers have tried their best and even 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.840
 just because this game was 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.860
 made for some kind of competition there 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.680
 some kind of 72 hour or 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:47.280
 42 hours and I do not remember now honestly 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:49.440
 I speak but game to us developers 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.090
 tried but I would like of course 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:56.910
 here are these ghosts here or 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:59.130
 monsters would be bigger because so 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.920
 they really are not enough to 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:04.769
 fully as if scared because my 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:08.100
 I met at all when I ran away only 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:10.380
 of how I collected the keys and not at all 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.480
 saw though assembled the right handkerchief for 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.000
 so that she disappeared so that she wanted 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.549
 would like developers to refine 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.329
 this game though game is a bastion for competition 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.889
 I think 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.199
 it is unlikely the developers will be 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:24.840
 modifying they probably will 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:28.800
 some other projects but still 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:31.080
 I wish them good luck in developing new ones 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.789
 horror of games because this game is for me 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.039
 seemed pretty good especially for 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:38.039
 such a small amount of time for 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:39.930
 which she was made so what a bitch 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:41.669
 for download I will leave in the description 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.139
