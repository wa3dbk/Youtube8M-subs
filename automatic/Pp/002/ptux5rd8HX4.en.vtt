in school or did you go something
completely<00:01:21.990> art<00:01:22.710> but<00:01:23.009> I<00:01:23.040> think<00:01:23.400> when<00:01:24.090> you're

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
completely art but I think when you're

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.820 
completely art but I think when you're
an<00:01:24.270> entrepreneur<00:01:24.360> you're<00:01:25.350> paving<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.799> way

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
an entrepreneur you're paving the way

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.020 
an entrepreneur you're paving the way
and<00:01:25.950> that's<00:01:26.130> something<00:01:26.369> that<00:01:26.549> lives<00:01:26.729> within

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
and that's something that lives within

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.399 
and that's something that lives within
you<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.360> so<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.450> believe<00:01:27.869> there's<00:01:28.049> people<00:01:28.320> who

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
you and so I believe there's people who

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.929 
you and so I believe there's people who
are<00:01:28.500> born<00:01:28.770> entrepreneurs<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.520> that's<00:01:29.759> also

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
are born entrepreneurs and that's also

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.609 
are born entrepreneurs and that's also
something<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.360> can<00:01:30.420> learn<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.020> which<00:01:31.500> is

something you can learn and which is

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.499 
something you can learn and which is
what<00:01:31.770> I<00:01:31.799> wrote<00:01:32.040> in<00:01:32.189> my<00:01:32.220> book<00:01:32.310> okay<00:01:32.670> so<00:01:33.000> this<00:01:33.360> is

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
and what I recommend is adding and

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.479 
and what I recommend is adding and
layering<00:02:06.299> lots<00:02:07.290> of<00:02:07.439> lashes<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:08.160> on<00:02:08.220> top<00:02:08.459> of

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
layering lots of lashes and on top of

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.790 
layering lots of lashes and on top of
that<00:02:08.640> adding<00:02:09.149> white<00:02:09.599> eyeliner<00:02:10.020> under<00:02:10.470> the

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
that adding white eyeliner under the

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.589 
that adding white eyeliner under the
waterline<00:02:11.129> and<00:02:11.489> what<00:02:11.879> this<00:02:12.000> does<00:02:12.209> is<00:02:12.450> that<00:02:12.480> it

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
waterline and what this does is that it

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.220 
waterline and what this does is that it
pops<00:02:12.930> the

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
pops the

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.920 
pops the
