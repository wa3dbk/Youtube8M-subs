00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.299
 That's good news for our editorial staff. 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.849
 to start launch of the long awaited 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:15.610
 playstation fact is therefore it is consuming 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:17.020
 bigger sachets for sure the bigger 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.560
 The novelty they showed was the 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:22.930
 control is not the picture is full of 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:26.110
 new things and touchpad that appeared a 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:29.320
 but rumor was confirmed gelateria 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.880
 touch the front is also cool but neither 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.399
 It seems like it's something that's going to be now. 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.609
 for games to know to navigate the 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:39.460
 history in the backward but not 

00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:42.789
 that little girl that is me is already a 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:46.570
 motor mode feature is a 

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:49.030
 is voting but I do not think the 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.739
 share button was the biggest news of 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.649
 control is one of the most 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.300
 staff will be able to post videos 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:57.370
 directly after playing in the 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.489
 attack button begins the video from youtube 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.710
 back to play is well the video images to the 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:05.890
 power only on facebook with the knife in hand 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.460
 on the wheel for youtube and hashish in it 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.890
 line 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.360
 Now that I've never closed, it sure will. 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.590
 Being able to start doing is okay too. 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.980
 cool 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.200
 control the games you've already played because 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.400
 expectation that they announced that they 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.650
 and gives a little to start with the 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.590
 expectation did not have a large 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:26.680
 it 's just not having no big name 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.970
 still did not have the graphic jump was not 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.590
 very big but that 's the way we 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:34.330
 I hope this is not going to be a difference 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:36.130
 how was the one on ps2 or ps3 is so different 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.680
 But you can tell that this is a 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.780
 majority and certainly ahead of 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.960
 People expect the best but for 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:49.570
 while they announced that the roni who 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:52.810
 knowing but it's a name is a union more 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:55.030
 heavy and also had the game in hand 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.590
 keko for now calls a pawn is not the 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.050
 official name but it's going to be a game 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:04.000
 unique offering 4 and also thanks 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:07.720
 of Indonesia has a dragon extension 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.119
 she is also very nice and also had a 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.740
 night work was one of the largest 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.480
 so no one really surprises 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.490
 I hoped that it was only the fact that they 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.420
 say that looks a version diablo 3 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:20.380
 ps3 and psp 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.450
 so it had been released 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.860
 exclusively for pc to fight him 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.769
 commented that he wanted to make a 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.780
 for consoles but was not reporting 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:31.300
 none and then suddenly they appear in 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.459
 house with no happy because it is so 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.709
 holds a surprise and that worked was 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:39.700
 really a surprise in the language in the 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:42.459
 nobody knew you restraint did not 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:46.060
 have shown the console image 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:48.890
 moment i never expectation 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.780
 for then you think is strange is 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.170
 announce a console and did not show the 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.090
 console but I think they really are 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.800
 wanting to make a move leave some 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.709
 thing for later because this year the 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:03.680
 people still have three is that it is an area of 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.910
 sale and June will fix and then he 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.340
 You have to save something to 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.690
 show things then sure black to 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.610
 people were waiting for them to show 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.830
 finally the island and granting more 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.000
 some games for the people can stay 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.250
 still more the expectation of 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.470
 pronouncement son looks there trying 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.120
 show three in the gallery if you're more 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:27.099
 of human beings shows that the 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:27.099
 family of a shock
