00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
on the laptop you see it takes a little

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:48.670 
on the laptop you see it takes a little
more<00:01:46.100> practice<00:01:46.869> but<00:01:47.869> the<00:01:48.080> trick<00:01:48.289> is<00:01:48.320> to<00:01:48.440> keep

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
more practice but the trick is to keep

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:59.270 
more practice but the trick is to keep
it

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.350 

actually<00:02:00.280> really<00:02:00.490> got<00:02:00.610> to<00:02:00.730> get<00:02:00.820> into<00:02:01.060> control

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
actually really got to get into control

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.190 
actually really got to get into control
you<00:02:02.020> get<00:02:02.140> just<00:02:02.350> been<00:02:02.470> spinning<00:02:02.680> too<00:02:03.010> much
