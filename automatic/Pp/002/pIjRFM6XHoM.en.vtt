wanted to take care of patients which is
one<00:00:15.929> of<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.049> reasons<00:00:16.350> why<00:00:16.470> I<00:00:16.500> left

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
one of the reasons why I left

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.000 
one of the reasons why I left
engineering<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:17.730> went<00:00:18.150> into<00:00:18.420> surgery<00:00:19.170> I<00:00:19.380> also

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
engineering and went into surgery I also

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.429 
engineering and went into surgery I also
like<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.580> technologic<00:00:21.480> aspects<00:00:21.960> of<00:00:22.109> it<00:00:22.260> and

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
like the technologic aspects of it and

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.410 
like the technologic aspects of it and
within<00:00:23.070> vascular<00:00:23.609> surgery<00:00:24.000> there's

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
within vascular surgery there's

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.109 
within vascular surgery there's
constantly<00:00:25.350> innovations<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.550> different

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
constantly innovations and and different

technologies that are evolving
developing<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.099> coming<00:00:29.400> out<00:00:30.349> and<00:00:31.349> I<00:00:31.800> like<00:00:31.980> the

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
developing and coming out and I like the

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
personal contact with people i think we

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.760 
personal contact with people i think we
treat<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.670> whole<00:00:38.820> patient<00:00:38.879> well<00:00:39.719> we<00:00:40.590> are<00:00:40.739> a

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
treat the whole patient well we are a

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.910 
treat the whole patient well we are a
surgical<00:00:41.399> group<00:00:41.629> we<00:00:42.629> don't<00:00:42.870> look<00:00:43.559> at<00:00:43.710> patients

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
surgical group we don't look at patients

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.560 
surgical group we don't look at patients
and<00:00:44.340> think<00:00:44.550> right<00:00:44.730> away<00:00:44.969> that<00:00:45.210> they<00:00:45.329> need<00:00:45.480> an

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
and think right away that they need an

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.369 
and think right away that they need an
innovation<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.590> intervention<00:00:47.360> we<00:00:48.360> take<00:00:49.200> our

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
innovation and intervention we take our

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.680 
innovation and intervention we take our
time<00:00:49.559> talk<00:00:49.980> with<00:00:50.160> them<00:00:50.360> figure<00:00:51.360> out<00:00:51.420> their

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
time talk with them figure out their

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.090 
time talk with them figure out their
problems<00:00:51.840> along<00:00:52.350> with<00:00:52.530> them<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:52.860> figure<00:00:53.039> out

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
problems along with them and figure out

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.619 
problems along with them and figure out
the<00:00:53.309> best<00:00:53.430> course<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.059> that<00:00:54.149> may<00:00:54.329> or<00:00:54.449> may<00:00:54.480> not

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
the best course and that may or may not

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.430 
the best course and that may or may not
be<00:00:55.079> an<00:00:55.920> intervention<00:00:56.520> we<00:00:57.180> do<00:00:57.329> operations<00:00:58.020> as

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
be an intervention we do operations as

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.189 
be an intervention we do operations as
well<00:00:58.469> as<00:00:59.180> percutaneous<00:01:00.180> interventions<00:01:00.870> which

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
well as percutaneous interventions which

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.399 
well as percutaneous interventions which
means<00:01:01.500> things<00:01:01.920> like<00:01:02.070> stents<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.969> balloons<00:01:03.409> so

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
means things like stents and balloons so

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.010 
means things like stents and balloons so
we<00:01:04.559> have<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:04.769> wide<00:01:05.100> array<00:01:05.670> of<00:01:05.909> tools<00:01:06.720> at<00:01:06.990> our

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
we have a wide array of tools at our

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.320 
we have a wide array of tools at our
disposal<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.710> treat<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.189> patients<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.729> we

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
disposal to treat the patients and we

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.149 
disposal to treat the patients and we
may<00:01:09.479> decide<00:01:09.780> after<00:01:10.170> talking<00:01:10.560> with<00:01:10.710> them<00:01:10.950> that

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
may decide after talking with them that

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.590 
may decide after talking with them that
they<00:01:11.250> may<00:01:11.430> not<00:01:11.580> want<00:01:11.820> an<00:01:11.880> intervention<00:01:12.420> and

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
they may not want an intervention and

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.870 
they may not want an intervention and
the<00:01:13.049> best<00:01:13.260> thing<00:01:13.470> would<00:01:13.650> be<00:01:13.880> conservative

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
the best thing would be conservative

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.230 
the best thing would be conservative

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
make this university of north carolina

health care system vascular surgery
division<00:01:27.950> so<00:01:28.950> we're<00:01:29.280> not<00:01:31.250> we'd<00:01:32.250> like<00:01:32.430> it<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:32.610> be

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820

division so we're not we'd like it to be
so<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:33.119> we<00:01:33.210> don't<00:01:33.360> consider<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.900> campus<00:01:34.259> is

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
so that we don't consider the campus is

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.280 
so that we don't consider the campus is
separate<00:01:34.829> but<00:01:35.430> more<00:01:35.880> or<00:01:36.000> less<00:01:36.180> one<00:01:36.390> group<00:01:36.689> that

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
separate but more or less one group that

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.920 
separate but more or less one group that
can<00:01:37.770> operate<00:01:38.009> both<00:01:38.670> in<00:01:38.970> Chapel<00:01:39.360> Hill<00:01:39.390> as<00:01:39.720> well

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
can operate both in Chapel Hill as well

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.399 
can operate both in Chapel Hill as well
as<00:01:40.110> in<00:01:40.320> wake<00:01:41.070> county<00:01:41.720> we<00:01:42.720> think<00:01:42.960> that<00:01:43.020> we<00:01:43.200> offer

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
as in wake county we think that we offer

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.679 
as in wake county we think that we offer
a<00:01:44.390> novel<00:01:45.390> skill<00:01:46.259> set<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:47.430> patients<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.119> I

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
a novel skill set of patients and I

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.130 
a novel skill set of patients and I
think<00:01:48.960> that<00:01:49.320> if<00:01:49.560> we<00:01:49.890> can<00:01:50.390> offer<00:01:51.390> patients<00:01:51.780> both

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
think that if we can offer patients both

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.440 
think that if we can offer patients both
in<00:01:52.380> wake<00:01:52.560> county<00:01:52.590> as<00:01:53.220> well<00:01:53.549> as<00:01:53.909> in<00:01:54.030> chapel<00:01:54.420> hill

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
in wake county as well as in chapel hill

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.950 
in wake county as well as in chapel hill
all<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.380> benefits<00:01:55.799> of<00:01:55.950> both<00:01:56.130> systems<00:01:56.430> I<00:01:57.329> think

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
all the benefits of both systems I think

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.300 
all the benefits of both systems I think
that'll<00:01:58.140> be<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.320> best<00:01:58.500> for<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.740> patients<00:01:59.159> I

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
that'll be the best for the patients I

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.670 
that'll be the best for the patients I
think<00:02:00.119> what<00:02:00.329> I've<00:02:00.450> learned<00:02:00.719> from<00:02:00.990> my<00:02:01.079> patients

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
think what I've learned from my patients

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.410 
think what I've learned from my patients
and<00:02:01.829> continue<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.310> learn<00:02:02.490> from<00:02:02.549> my<00:02:02.909> patients

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
and continue to learn from my patients

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.469 
and continue to learn from my patients
is<00:02:03.570> how<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:03.750> be<00:02:03.930> a<00:02:03.960> better<00:02:04.110> doctor<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:05.060> I<00:02:06.060> think

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
is how to be a better doctor and I think

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.900 
is how to be a better doctor and I think
part<00:02:07.110> of<00:02:07.290> it<00:02:07.439> as<00:02:07.649> it<00:02:07.920> evolves<00:02:08.160> is<00:02:08.489> figuring<00:02:08.910> out

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
part of it as it evolves is figuring out

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.869 
part of it as it evolves is figuring out
what<00:02:09.360> each<00:02:09.539> patient<00:02:10.190> what<00:02:11.190> their<00:02:11.430> needs<00:02:11.610> are

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
what each patient what their needs are

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.670 
what each patient what their needs are
and<00:02:12.209> how<00:02:12.810> we<00:02:12.870> can<00:02:13.050> be

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
and how we can be

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.830 
and how we can be
meet<00:02:13.980> those<00:02:14.159> needs<00:02:14.189> together<00:02:14.879> and<00:02:15.180> I<00:02:15.629> think

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
meet those needs together and I think

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.940 
meet those needs together and I think
that's<00:02:15.989> something<00:02:16.170> I'm<00:02:16.439> continually

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
that's something I'm continually

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.250 
that's something I'm continually
learning
