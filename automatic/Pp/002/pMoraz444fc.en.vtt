00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
only those two strings a little bit of a

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.630 
only those two strings a little bit of a
pro<00:01:08.039> tip<00:01:08.340> here<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:08.880> if<00:01:09.600> you<00:01:10.259> rest<00:01:11.100> one<00:01:11.399> of<00:01:11.520> your

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
pro tip here is if you rest one of your

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.399 
pro tip here is if you rest one of your
fingers<00:01:12.060> maybe<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.600> second<00:01:12.990> finger<00:01:13.170> which

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
fingers maybe the second finger which

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.859 
fingers maybe the second finger which
I'm<00:01:13.560> using<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:14.009> fret<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.220> cord<00:01:14.549> with<00:01:14.869> across

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
I'm using to fret the cord with across

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.510 
I'm using to fret the cord with across
the<00:01:16.140> thinner<00:01:16.380> strings<00:01:16.740> across<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.189> highest

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
the thinner strings across the highest

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.779 
the thinner strings across the highest
strings<00:01:17.759> in<00:01:17.909> other<00:01:18.090> words<00:01:18.560> you<00:01:19.560> will<00:01:20.130> denim<00:01:20.520> if

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:20.789 
strings in other words you will denim if

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:23.120 
strings in other words you will denim if
you<00:01:20.909> hit<00:01:21.180> them<00:01:21.240> accidentally<00:01:21.869> which<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:22.920> good

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
you hit them accidentally which is good

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.499 
you hit them accidentally which is good
that<00:01:23.310> means<00:01:23.580> instead<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:23.970> getting<00:01:24.300> something

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
that means instead of getting something

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.990 
that means instead of getting something
like<00:01:25.220> you're<00:01:26.220> going<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.399> get<00:01:26.520> something<00:01:26.850> like

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
like you're going to get something like

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.550 
like you're going to get something like
me<00:01:27.440> which<00:01:28.440> isn't<00:01:29.069> so<00:01:29.369> noticeable<00:01:30.049> so<00:01:31.049> again<00:01:31.380> we

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
me which isn't so noticeable so again we

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.039 
me which isn't so noticeable so again we
have<00:01:32.960> like<00:01:33.960> so<00:01:34.940> now<00:01:35.940> the<00:01:36.030> next<00:01:36.750> thing<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:36.899> we

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
have like so now the next thing that we

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.990 
have like so now the next thing that we
have<00:01:37.080> is<00:01:37.319> a<00:01:37.350> small<00:01:37.649> amount<00:01:37.860> of<00:01:38.069> vibrato<00:01:38.549> on<00:01:38.880> the

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
have is a small amount of vibrato on the

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.940 
have is a small amount of vibrato on the
note<00:01:39.179> of<00:01:39.209> D<00:01:39.600> which<00:01:39.840> is<00:01:39.869> on<00:01:40.080> the<00:01:40.200> fifth<00:01:40.409> fret<00:01:40.590> of

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
note of D which is on the fifth fret of

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.820 
note of D which is on the fifth fret of
the<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.100> string<00:01:41.190> and<00:01:42.110> is<00:01:43.110> played<00:01:43.350> with<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.530> single

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
the a string and is played with a single

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.080 
the a string and is played with a single
down<00:01:44.009> stroke<00:01:45.979> and<00:01:46.979> then<00:01:47.369> we<00:01:47.490> go<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.940> note

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
down stroke and then we go to the note

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.419 
down stroke and then we go to the note
of<00:01:48.330> a<00:01:48.450> which<00:01:48.750> is<00:01:48.899> on<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.110> fifth<00:01:49.319> fret<00:01:49.470> of<00:01:49.830> the<00:01:49.890> E

00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:50.429 
of a which is on the fifth fret of the E

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:52.699 
of a which is on the fifth fret of the E
string<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.330> again<00:01:51.840> we<00:01:52.080> need<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.229> small<00:01:52.530> amount

00:01:52.699 --> 00:01:52.709 
string and again we need a small amount

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:56.840 
string and again we need a small amount
of<00:01:52.860> vibrato<00:01:53.280> there<00:01:54.770> now<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.829> vibrato<00:01:56.460> which

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
of vibrato there now the vibrato which

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.990 
of vibrato there now the vibrato which
is<00:01:56.969> used<00:01:57.439> is<00:01:58.439> pretty<00:01:58.920> typical<00:01:59.130> low<00:01:59.640> string

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
is used is pretty typical low string

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.760 
is used is pretty typical low string
Biograph<00:02:00.539> told<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:01.020> is<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.350> say<00:02:01.530> I'm<00:02:01.649> getting

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
Biograph told that is to say I'm getting

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.010 
Biograph told that is to say I'm getting
fingers<00:02:02.399> one<00:02:02.939> two<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:03.299> three<00:02:03.479> on<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.750> string

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
fingers one two and three on the string

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.959 
fingers one two and three on the string
here<00:02:04.289> and<00:02:04.469> I'm<00:02:04.890> deflating<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.759> string

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
here and I'm deflating the string

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.270 
here and I'm deflating the string
slightly<00:02:06.659> downwards<00:02:07.170> letting<00:02:07.829> it<00:02:07.950> return

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
slightly downwards letting it return

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.120 
slightly downwards letting it return
back<00:02:08.549> to<00:02:08.729> its<00:02:08.789> original<00:02:09.000> point<00:02:09.600> so<00:02:10.560> it's<00:02:10.709> not<00:02:10.859> a

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
back to its original point so it's not a

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.280 
back to its original point so it's not a
case<00:02:11.340> of<00:02:11.370> pushing<00:02:11.820> the<00:02:11.940> string<00:02:12.209> as<00:02:12.420> you<00:02:12.690> really

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
case of pushing the string as you really

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.720 
case of pushing the string as you really
don't<00:02:13.470> have<00:02:13.620> so<00:02:13.829> much<00:02:13.950> room<00:02:14.250> on<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.549> lower

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
don't have so much room on the lower

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.000 
don't have so much room on the lower
strings<00:02:14.970> and<00:02:15.780> you<00:02:15.989> certainly<00:02:16.260> don't<00:02:16.590> fully

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
strings and you certainly don't fully

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.650 
strings and you certainly don't fully
bend<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:17.880> string<00:02:18.150> like<00:02:18.570> this<00:02:18.600> for<00:02:18.870> example

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
bend the string like this for example

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.520 
bend the string like this for example
but<00:02:21.660> we're<00:02:21.780> just<00:02:21.810> looking<00:02:21.959> to<00:02:22.140> remove<00:02:22.380> the

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
but we're just looking to remove the

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.770 
but we're just looking to remove the
street<00:02:22.739> ever<00:02:22.950> so<00:02:23.130> slightly<00:02:23.370> down<00:02:23.670> let<00:02:24.540> it<00:02:24.660> back

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
street ever so slightly down let it back

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.810 
street ever so slightly down let it back
again<00:02:25.109> and<00:02:25.350> repeat<00:02:25.680> that<00:02:25.890> motion<00:02:26.160> you'll

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
again and repeat that motion you'll

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.170 
again and repeat that motion you'll
notice<00:02:27.239> also<00:02:27.600> as<00:02:27.840> well<00:02:28.049> I<00:02:28.079> have<00:02:29.090> contact<00:02:30.090> with

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
notice also as well I have contact with

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.370 
notice also as well I have contact with
the<00:02:30.239> edge<00:02:30.329> of<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.510> fingerboard<00:02:30.840> just<00:02:31.200> here

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
the edge of the fingerboard just here

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.199 
the edge of the fingerboard just here
which<00:02:31.560> acts<00:02:31.829> as<00:02:32.010> a<00:02:32.040> pivots<00:02:32.549> and<00:02:32.700> helps<00:02:32.970> me<00:02:33.090> to

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
which acts as a pivots and helps me to

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.090 
which acts as a pivots and helps me to
get<00:02:33.329> that<00:02:33.480> vibrato<00:02:33.890> anyway

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
get that vibrato anyway

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.740 
get that vibrato anyway
we<00:02:35.280> don't<00:02:35.459> spend<00:02:35.730> too<00:02:35.910> long<00:02:36.090> on<00:02:36.239> the<00:02:36.359> Biograph

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
we don't spend too long on the Biograph

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.930 
we don't spend too long on the Biograph
tour<00:02:37.019> because<00:02:37.260> these<00:02:37.410> two<00:02:37.620> notes<00:02:37.890> go<00:02:38.130> by<00:02:38.310> go<00:02:38.790> by

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
tour because these two notes go by go by

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.509 
tour because these two notes go by go by
rather<00:02:39.329> quickly

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
rather quickly

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.070 
rather quickly
so<00:02:42.519> just<00:02:42.970> that's<00:02:43.090> a<00:02:43.239> little<00:02:43.510> bit<00:02:43.780> of<00:02:43.870> something

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
so just that's a little bit of something

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.910 
so just that's a little bit of something
to<00:02:44.260> them<00:02:44.650> so<00:02:45.579> the<00:02:45.670> first<00:02:45.909> part<00:02:46.120> there<00:02:46.390> is

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.970 

alright<00:02:50.920> so<00:02:52.200> there<00:02:53.200> is<00:02:53.290> that<00:02:53.409> the<00:02:53.530> second<00:02:53.829> half

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
alright so there is that the second half

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.880 
alright so there is that the second half
to<00:02:54.189> this<00:02:54.340> face<00:02:54.840> and<00:02:55.840> we<00:02:56.019> have<00:02:56.140> the<00:02:56.260> same<00:02:56.470> open<00:02:56.799> e

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
to this face and we have the same open e

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.430 
to this face and we have the same open e
power<00:02:57.159> chord<00:02:57.280> again<00:02:57.730> so<00:02:57.909> that's<00:02:58.090> the<00:02:58.329> open<00:02:58.780> low

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
power chord again so that's the open low

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.780 
power chord again so that's the open low
E<00:02:59.470> string<00:02:59.620> the<00:02:59.980> thickest<00:03:00.310> string<00:03:00.549> in

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
E string the thickest string in

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.910 
E string the thickest string in
conjunction<00:03:01.360> with<00:03:01.599> the<00:03:01.840> second<00:03:02.319> fret<00:03:02.590> of<00:03:02.860> the

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
conjunction with the second fret of the

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.190 
conjunction with the second fret of the
a<00:03:03.069> string<00:03:03.159> again<00:03:03.549> so<00:03:04.180> that's<00:03:04.360> the<00:03:04.510> beep<00:03:04.690> sorry

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
a string again so that's the beep sorry

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:12.449 
a string again so that's the beep sorry
the<00:03:05.349> e<00:03:05.379> power<00:03:05.739> chord<00:03:07.829> with<00:03:08.829> it<00:03:08.950> down<00:03:09.900> again<00:03:11.459> how

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
the e power chord with it down again how

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.869 
the e power chord with it down again how
we<00:03:12.519> then<00:03:13.120> play<00:03:13.359> the<00:03:13.599> third<00:03:13.870> fret<00:03:14.140> of<00:03:14.170> the<00:03:14.349> a

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:14.879 
we then play the third fret of the a

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:19.710 
we then play the third fret of the a
string<00:03:15.879> which<00:03:16.390> is<00:03:16.540> C<00:03:18.000> maybe<00:03:19.000> a<00:03:19.120> little<00:03:19.239> vibrato

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
string which is C maybe a little vibrato

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.240 
string which is C maybe a little vibrato
there<00:03:20.170> too<00:03:20.349> with<00:03:20.560> the<00:03:20.620> first<00:03:20.859> string<00:03:21.040> of<00:03:21.129> this

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
there too with the first string of this

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.670 
there too with the first string of this
time<00:03:21.810> and<00:03:22.810> then<00:03:22.900> a<00:03:22.930> technique<00:03:23.379> called<00:03:23.409> the

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
time and then a technique called the

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.460 
time and then a technique called the
hammer<00:03:23.950> on<00:03:24.040> from<00:03:24.819> the<00:03:24.970> note<00:03:25.120> of<00:03:25.329> C<00:03:25.629> to<00:03:26.200> the<00:03:26.230> note

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
hammer on from the note of C to the note

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.860 
hammer on from the note of C to the note
of<00:03:26.680> D<00:03:26.859> so<00:03:27.459> from<00:03:27.670> the<00:03:27.849> third<00:03:28.090> fret<00:03:28.359> to<00:03:28.569> the<00:03:28.659> fifth

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
of D so from the third fret to the fifth

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.259 
of D so from the third fret to the fifth
fret<00:03:29.019> of<00:03:29.079> the<00:03:29.230> a<00:03:29.319> string<00:03:29.470> and<00:03:30.040> the<00:03:30.970> hammer<00:03:31.180> on

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
fret of the a string and the hammer on

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:35.190 
fret of the a string and the hammer on
is<00:03:32.040> really<00:03:33.040> a<00:03:33.280> method<00:03:33.549> of<00:03:33.790> getting<00:03:33.849> a<00:03:34.480> higher

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
is really a method of getting a higher

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.330 
is really a method of getting a higher
note<00:03:35.530> to<00:03:35.799> sound<00:03:36.480> whilst<00:03:37.480> not<00:03:37.750> having<00:03:38.170> to<00:03:38.379> pluck

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
note to sound whilst not having to pluck

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.259 
note to sound whilst not having to pluck
the<00:03:39.519> string<00:03:39.790> again

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
the string again

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:42.899 
the string again
so<00:03:40.420> we<00:03:40.629> are<00:03:40.750> there<00:03:40.989> really<00:03:41.349> is<00:03:41.920> a<00:03:42.430> C<00:03:42.879> note

00:03:42.899 --> 00:03:42.909 
so we are there really is a C note

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:47.789 
so we are there really is a C note
played<00:03:43.409> with<00:03:44.409> the<00:03:44.530> down<00:03:44.709> stroke<00:03:46.260> the<00:03:47.260> C<00:03:47.590> note

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
played with the down stroke the C note

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:52.800 
played with the down stroke the C note
played<00:03:47.829> again<00:03:48.699> with<00:03:49.180> a<00:03:49.209> Down<00:03:49.480> stroke<00:03:51.660> but<00:03:52.660> with

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
played again with a Down stroke but with

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.430 
played again with a Down stroke but with
the<00:03:52.900> third<00:03:53.169> finger<00:03:53.849> primarily<00:03:55.260> working<00:03:56.260> now

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
the third finger primarily working now

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.470 
the third finger primarily working now
on<00:03:56.650> to<00:03:56.769> the<00:03:56.859> string<00:03:57.099> there<00:03:57.370> on<00:03:57.669> the<00:03:58.120> fifth<00:03:58.359> fret

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
on to the string there on the fifth fret

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.080 
on to the string there on the fifth fret
so<00:03:58.930> we<00:03:59.019> have<00:03:59.109> a<00:03:59.139> movement<00:03:59.620> which<00:03:59.739> is

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
so we have a movement which is

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.360 
so we have a movement which is
relatively<00:04:01.379> tricky<00:04:02.379> to<00:04:02.620> do<00:04:02.769> for<00:04:02.980> some<00:04:03.099> people

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
relatively tricky to do for some people

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:04.949 
relatively tricky to do for some people
at<00:04:03.489> first<00:04:03.699> but<00:04:03.970> do<00:04:04.120> persevere<00:04:04.629> with<00:04:04.750> this

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
at first but do persevere with this

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:07.110 
at first but do persevere with this
because<00:04:05.260> you'll<00:04:05.410> use<00:04:05.440> it<00:04:05.829> a<00:04:05.949> lot<00:04:06.099> we're<00:04:06.940> gonna

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
because you'll use it a lot we're gonna

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.080 
because you'll use it a lot we're gonna
take<00:04:07.870> that<00:04:08.019> third<00:04:08.290> finger<00:04:08.760> particularly<00:04:09.760> and

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
take that third finger particularly and

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.199 
take that third finger particularly and
go<00:04:11.049> from<00:04:11.349> maybe<00:04:11.650> two<00:04:12.069> three<00:04:12.519> centimeters

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
go from maybe two three centimeters

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:15.599 
go from maybe two three centimeters
broke<00:04:13.359> the<00:04:13.480> string<00:04:13.769> which<00:04:14.769> is<00:04:14.799> a<00:04:15.160> federal

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:15.609 
broke the string which is a federal

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:17.830 
broke the string which is a federal
distance

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
and the force of the finger slamming

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.890 
and the force of the finger slamming
onto<00:04:21.799> the<00:04:22.040> string<00:04:22.340> should<00:04:22.669> make<00:04:22.850> that<00:04:23.060> denotes

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
onto the string should make that denotes

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:30.210 
onto the string should make that denotes
on<00:04:24.199> the<00:04:24.320> fifth<00:04:24.500> fret<00:04:24.680> sound<00:04:25.010> so<00:04:25.970> that<00:04:26.180> would<00:04:26.300> be

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.290 

that's<00:04:31.220> obviously<00:04:31.610> slower<00:04:31.940> than<00:04:32.210> the

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
that's obviously slower than the

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.580 
that's obviously slower than the
original<00:04:32.600> hope<00:04:33.050> to<00:04:33.169> speed<00:04:33.410> out<00:04:33.590> man

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
original hope to speed out man

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:47.200 
original hope to speed out man
right<00:04:36.590> so<00:04:36.830> so<00:04:37.580> in<00:04:37.699> total<00:04:37.910> we<00:04:38.240> would<00:04:38.449> have

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.579 

so<00:04:48.210> there<00:04:48.389> you<00:04:48.419> have<00:04:48.509> the<00:04:48.689> intro<00:04:49.199> riff<00:04:49.379> to

00:04:49.579 --> 00:04:49.589 
so there you have the intro riff to

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:51.920 
so there you have the intro riff to
workingman<00:04:50.129> by<00:04:50.339> brush<00:04:50.610> I<00:04:50.909> can<00:04:51.330> a<00:04:51.360> classic

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
workingman by brush I can a classic

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.010 
workingman by brush I can a classic
piece<00:04:52.289> of<00:04:52.699> epic<00:04:53.699> minor<00:04:54.029> riff<00:04:54.509> for<00:04:54.719> me<00:04:54.809> in<00:04:54.930> the

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
piece of epic minor riff for me in the

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.719 
piece of epic minor riff for me in the
way<00:04:55.139> that<00:04:55.349> I<00:04:55.379> think<00:04:55.499> only<00:04:55.800> mid<00:04:56.189> seventies

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:56.729 
way that I think only mid seventies

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:59.540 
way that I think only mid seventies
songs<00:04:57.119> can<00:04:57.479> do<00:04:57.770> it's<00:04:58.770> in<00:04:58.979> the<00:04:59.039> key<00:04:59.189> of<00:04:59.219> E<00:04:59.369> minor

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
songs can do it's in the key of E minor

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.540 
songs can do it's in the key of E minor
it's<00:04:59.999> relatively<00:05:00.659> simple<00:05:01.319> although<00:05:02.309> it<00:05:02.399> does

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
it's relatively simple although it does

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:03.709 
it's relatively simple although it does
have<00:05:02.699> a<00:05:02.729> couple<00:05:02.969> of<00:05:03.029> techniques<00:05:03.389> in<00:05:03.569> there

00:05:03.709 --> 00:05:03.719 
have a couple of techniques in there

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:04.790 
have a couple of techniques in there
which<00:05:03.899> might<00:05:04.110> take<00:05:04.349> a<00:05:04.379> little<00:05:04.529> bit<00:05:04.740> of

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
which might take a little bit of

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.969 
which might take a little bit of
practice<00:05:05.039> but<00:05:05.279> as<00:05:05.610> ever<00:05:06.409> persevere<00:05:07.409> pay

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:07.979 
practice but as ever persevere pay

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:09.230 
practice but as ever persevere pay
attention<00:05:08.490> to<00:05:08.610> detail

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
attention to detail

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.559 
attention to detail
and<00:05:09.330> you'll<00:05:09.569> get<00:05:09.719> that<00:05:09.930> good<00:05:10.379> look
