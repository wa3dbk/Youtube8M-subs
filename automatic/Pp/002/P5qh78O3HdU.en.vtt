00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 hello you love is the thirteenth 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.770
 december and it's crisp cold her 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.060
 hear my voice is also one 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.189
 cracked a little bit 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.330
 That's why I want one with you today 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.219
 knit hose scarf 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.250
 all you need is one 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.680
 scissors and wool either 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.390
 The thicker wool you need with seven needles 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.970
 can knit something from seven 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:25.130
 Needles is okay or several 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.060
 Thinner threads you can do that 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.160
 possible now with the thinner ones 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.720
 but I will work for you 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.640
 afterwards also show the scarf 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.660
 I knitted with the thicker wool 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.059
 have and then we're off we go 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.219
 take us the three drives or just the 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.690
 1 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:45.090
 on the same length and make 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.739
 first of all, a loop-the one 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.780
 means I first make a knot 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:53.910
 such a loose and then I pull 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:57.960
 a bend through and come now 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:00.149
 on the thumb on right hand or 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.250
 left hand is the question if your right 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.080
 or left behind since I am 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.930
 right-handed and take on the left 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.030
 hand and now the thread behind the 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.610
 forefinger in front of middle finger 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.729
 behind the ring finger and from the small one 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:18.540
 finger carried and then on the 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:22.380
 other side back so always pay attention 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:26.939
 around the fingers arise then feel the 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:32.729
 thread once behind the fingers and long 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:34.680
 lie over the loops and now 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.630
 pull the loop a bit high and 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.579
 pokes his finger through so the Sun 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:46.549
 that the colors of the bend 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:48.960
 is enclosed draw little tight 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:51.869
 and then all over again 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.570
 that is what we are very much now 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:58.680
 make frequent shows you again 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.920
 so over the loop the thread long 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.920
 lie 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.479
 and then always with the fingers over the 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:20.209
 working thread and through the loops 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:22.700
 of course, I'll do it now 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:25.580
 a bit slower but usually 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.010
 It works very fast and you can do that 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.630
 a pretty long hose stole in 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.630
 only knit for an hour 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.680
 and now that's enough then also first 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.700
 let's take the loop from 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:18.010
 finger on thumb and move in 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.330
 little bit in the back so that you 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.210
 already sees that there is a small boat 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.520
 so to speak, gives the thread hanging 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.810
 then let it loose 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.650
 anything we need also 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:32.350
 afterwards to tie together 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.700
 I 'll put my tuber under 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.209
 the table that works then I think 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.920
 much easier and now we do 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.780
 as I said for a while 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.750
 I will not quite agree with this 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.970
 I must say the end strictly because I 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.959
 already a tube scarf and this 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.959
 are rather wool rests 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:12.610
 and when the treasure is so long 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:13.810
 how we would like to have this piece 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.640
 are we now submit the first 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.640
 I knitted in less than ten minutes 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.010
 Then it's time to remove the stitches 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.380
 that means that we are the thread 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:33.310
 we cut off a good one 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:34.540
 piece of thread hanging so that we afterwards 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.169
 can still knot and now 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:42.820
 take off the stitches neatly 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:49.330
 We can put all threads from above 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:52.690
 through the mesh and then take it 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.770
 first off the little finger and then 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.699
 we do it all on the ring finger 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:05:03.789
 so again from the top through the lax 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:12.250
 through the stitches and the ring again 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:14.820
 lose weight and here again from above 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.820
 by 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:34.960
 and then finally place four 

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:39.639
 we only need the two 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:44.499
 remove knotted together 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:46.270
 At the beginning the chance is such a small yes 

00:05:44.499 --> 00:05:48.759
 such a small loop with emerged 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.490
 that happens at the beginning like the 

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:52.779
 you can knot with 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:55.930
 You can easily do this bend there 

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:58.770
 with knotting and then I'll do it now 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:02.349
 a very simple double knot rhine 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:04.589
 and the extra ends I cut 

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:04.589
 then on 

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:39.119
 that is already our hose scarf 

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:39.119
 I'm taking my wrist now 

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:57.469
 and this is the scarf that I'm about to do 

00:06:54.439 --> 00:07:01.539
 knitted some time already there 

00:06:57.469 --> 00:07:01.539
 I knitted it for about 45 minutes 

00:07:01.719 --> 00:07:06.620
 and I think he is long and cuddly 

00:07:04.219 --> 00:07:09.219
 that is as I said with the 

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:13.310
 thicker wool 

00:07:09.219 --> 00:07:15.069
 there you see him again completely and so 

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:20.509
 It looks good when I see them 

00:07:15.069 --> 00:07:21.800
 So had already occupied in loops 

00:07:20.509 --> 00:07:26.900
 I think it is a very good fat 

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:28.370
 I hope you have one now 

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:31.789
 Have fun and you will stay 

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:33.169
 Declaration that I have now fun and he 

00:07:31.789 --> 00:07:36.159
 I wish you much fun knitting 

00:07:33.169 --> 00:07:36.159
 till tomorrow
