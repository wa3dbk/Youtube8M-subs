00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
lightweight yarn now for the pattern

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.610 
lightweight yarn now for the pattern
itself<00:00:56.789> we<00:00:57.149> start<00:00:57.449> with<00:00:57.829> 46<00:00:59.239> chains<00:01:00.239> but<00:01:01.199> if

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
itself we start with 46 chains but if

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
you're using a different weight of yarn

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.609 
you're using a different weight of yarn
or<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.420> just<00:01:03.600> want<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.780> different<00:01:03.899> width<00:01:04.229> it's

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
or you just want a different width it's

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.830 
or you just want a different width it's
basically<00:01:05.159> any<00:01:05.430> multiple<00:01:05.939> of<00:01:06.060> two<00:01:06.240> so<00:01:06.659> any

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
basically any multiple of two so any

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.219 
basically any multiple of two so any
even<00:01:07.260> number<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.590> chains<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.960> here<00:01:09.960> I'm<00:01:10.110> just

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
even number of chains and here I'm just

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.020 
even number of chains and here I'm just
going<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.560> show<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.920> couple<00:01:11.310> of<00:01:11.580> sample

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
going to show you a couple of sample

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.270 
going to show you a couple of sample
rows<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:13.110> you<00:01:13.170> can<00:01:13.290> see<00:01:13.409> how<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.619> first<00:01:14.010> half

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
rows so you can see how the first half

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.590 
rows so you can see how the first half
of<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.520> pattern<00:01:14.820> comes<00:01:15.090> together<00:01:17.299> so<00:01:18.299> what

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
of the pattern comes together so what

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.160 
of the pattern comes together so what
we're<00:01:18.750> going<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.049> do<00:01:19.350> is<00:01:19.740> I<00:01:20.640> am<00:01:20.909> going<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.479> make

we're going to do is I am going to make

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.050 
we're going to do is I am going to make
a<00:01:22.229> puff<00:01:22.619> stitch<00:01:22.650> in<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.400> fourth<00:01:23.670> chain<00:01:24.000> from

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
a puff stitch in the fourth chain from

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.990 
a puff stitch in the fourth chain from
the<00:01:24.270> hook<00:01:24.470> which<00:01:25.470> is<00:01:25.500> right<00:01:25.860> there<00:01:26.369> I<00:01:26.580> like<00:01:26.820> to

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
the hook which is right there I like to

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.760 
the hook which is right there I like to
work<00:01:27.119> into<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.479> bottom<00:01:27.840> of<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.229> chain<00:01:28.470> here

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
work into the bottom of the chain here

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.880 
work into the bottom of the chain here
if<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.520> prefer<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:29.850> work<00:01:30.000> in<00:01:30.119> that<00:01:30.420> top<00:01:30.659> V<00:01:30.930> you

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
now there are lots of versions of the

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.700 
now there are lots of versions of the
puff<00:01:36.180> stitch<00:01:36.210> they<00:01:36.689> all<00:01:36.780> have<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.049> basic<00:01:37.170> form

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
puff stitch they all have the basic form

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.399 
puff stitch they all have the basic form
really<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.729> differences<00:01:39.240> come<00:01:39.570> trying<00:01:40.350> to

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
really the differences come trying to

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.319 
really the differences come trying to
find<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.740> fourth<00:01:41.009> loop<00:01:41.520> again<00:01:41.790> here<00:01:42.030> there<00:01:42.210> we

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
find the fourth loop again here there we

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.270 
find the fourth loop again here there we
go<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.960> difference<00:01:43.290> comes<00:01:43.530> in<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.770> number<00:01:44.100> of

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
go the difference comes in the number of

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.420 
go the difference comes in the number of
times<00:01:44.700> that<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:45.329> pull<00:01:45.899> up<00:01:46.020> loops<00:01:46.250> for<00:01:47.250> this

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
times that you pull up loops for this

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.670 
times that you pull up loops for this
particular<00:01:48.030> version<00:01:48.299> we're<00:01:49.259> going<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.530> pull

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
particular version we're going to pull

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.929 
particular version we're going to pull
out<00:01:49.860> flukes<00:01:50.189> three<00:01:50.460> times

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
out flukes three times

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.499 
out flukes three times
so<00:01:51.060> I've<00:01:51.149> yarn<00:01:51.390> Dover<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:51.990> go<00:01:52.259> into<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.680> stitch

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
so I've yarn Dover I go into the stitch

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:58.459 
so I've yarn Dover I go into the stitch
pull<00:01:54.509> up<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.750> loop<00:01:54.780> like<00:01:55.790> so<00:01:57.140> and<00:01:58.140> I<00:01:58.229> want<00:01:58.409> to

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
pull up a loop like so and I want to

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.660 
pull up a loop like so and I want to
pull<00:01:58.590> it<00:01:58.680> up<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.890> about<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.189> height<00:01:59.340> of<00:01:59.520> the

pull it up to about the height of the
puff<00:01:59.880> stitch<00:01:59.909> so<00:02:00.479> I<00:02:00.509> don't<00:02:00.869> keep<00:02:01.020> it<00:02:01.170> down

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
puff stitch so I don't keep it down

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.700 
puff stitch so I don't keep it down
close<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.860> keep<00:02:02.070> it<00:02:02.250> a<00:02:02.460> little<00:02:02.939> higher<00:02:03.710> working

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
close I keep it a little higher working

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.319 
close I keep it a little higher working
it<00:02:04.799> into<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.040> chains<00:02:05.369> can<00:02:05.670> be<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.820> little<00:02:06.119> a

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
it into the chains can be a little a

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.850 
it into the chains can be a little a
little<00:02:06.780> odd<00:02:07.079> it<00:02:07.290> gets<00:02:07.439> easier<00:02:07.770> with

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
little odd it gets easier with

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.309 
little odd it gets easier with
subsequent<00:02:08.789> rows<00:02:08.940> so<00:02:09.840> I'll<00:02:09.899> yarn<00:02:10.110> over<00:02:10.289> again

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
subsequent rows so I'll yarn over again

wonky a little strange in this Jean but
it'll<00:02:21.849> get<00:02:21.940> better<00:02:22.120> as<00:02:22.330> you<00:02:22.360> go

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
it'll get better as you go

four<00:02:33.849> five<00:02:34.300> six<00:02:34.599> seven<00:02:34.870> so<00:02:35.620> I'm<00:02:35.680> going<00:02:35.830> to<00:02:35.860> go

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
four five six seven so I'm going to go

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.890 
four five six seven so I'm going to go
ahead<00:02:36.099> and<00:02:36.459> yarn<00:02:36.730> over<00:02:37.060> and<00:02:37.090> pull<00:02:37.269> through<00:02:37.480> all

ahead and yarn over and pull through all
seven<00:02:38.290> loops<00:02:38.910> okay

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
seven loops okay

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.039 
seven loops okay
then<00:02:40.480> I'm<00:02:40.599> going<00:02:40.780> to<00:02:40.870> chain<00:02:41.140> one<00:02:42.450> like<00:02:43.450> so<00:02:43.750> then

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
then I'm going to chain one like so then

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:46.199 
then I'm going to chain one like so then
I<00:02:44.140> will<00:02:44.290> skip<00:02:44.590> the<00:02:44.769> next<00:02:44.920> chain<00:02:45.129> and<00:02:45.640> work<00:02:46.090> a

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
I will skip the next chain and work a

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:47.880 
I will skip the next chain and work a
puff<00:02:46.420> stitch<00:02:46.450> right<00:02:47.110> into<00:02:47.380> the<00:02:47.470> next<00:02:47.709> chain

puff stitch right into the next chain
after<00:02:48.040> that<00:02:48.900> so<00:02:49.900> let's<00:02:50.200> do<00:02:50.349> that<00:02:50.380> again<00:02:50.590> I

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
after that so let's do that again I

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.580 
after that so let's do that again I

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
one more time in that same chain pull it

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.880 
one more time in that same chain pull it

through<00:03:09.310> all<00:03:09.400> the<00:03:09.549> loops<00:03:09.670> and<00:03:10.230> those<00:03:11.230> are<00:03:11.829> two

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
through all the loops and those are two

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.520 
through all the loops and those are two
puff<00:03:12.220> stitches<00:03:12.540> and<00:03:13.540> I'll<00:03:13.660> chain<00:03:13.930> one<00:03:14.110> skip

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
puff stitches and I'll chain one skip

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.370 
puff stitches and I'll chain one skip
one<00:03:14.680> and<00:03:15.040> continue<00:03:15.459> on<00:03:15.670> down<00:03:16.030> until<00:03:16.900> I<00:03:16.930> come<00:03:17.290> to

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
one and continue on down until I come to

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.759 
one and continue on down until I come to
the<00:03:17.470> end<00:03:17.680> of<00:03:17.920> my<00:03:18.069> chain<00:03:18.510> when<00:03:19.510> I<00:03:19.540> get<00:03:19.989> to<00:03:20.680> the

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
the end of my chain when I get to the

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.300 
the end of my chain when I get to the
end<00:03:20.970> there<00:03:21.970> will<00:03:22.180> be<00:03:22.209> one<00:03:23.139> chain<00:03:23.530> remaining<00:03:24.010> so

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
end there will be one chain remaining so

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.699 
end there will be one chain remaining so
let's<00:03:25.150> pretend<00:03:25.630> I've<00:03:26.019> gotten<00:03:26.350> all<00:03:26.470> the<00:03:26.560> way<00:03:26.620> to

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
let's pretend I've gotten all the way to

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.470 
let's pretend I've gotten all the way to
the<00:03:26.799> end<00:03:26.920> of<00:03:27.010> this<00:03:27.100> row<00:03:27.340> there<00:03:28.060> would<00:03:28.150> be<00:03:28.180> only

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
the end of this row there would be only

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.660 
the end of this row there would be only
two<00:03:28.660> chains<00:03:28.959> remaining<00:03:29.530> so<00:03:30.160> I<00:03:30.190> would<00:03:30.370> skip

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
two chains remaining so I would skip

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.280 
two chains remaining so I would skip
that<00:03:30.850> one<00:03:30.910> just<00:03:31.329> as<00:03:31.450> we<00:03:31.540> did<00:03:31.660> before<00:03:31.720> and<00:03:32.230> just

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
that one just as we did before and just

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.410 
that one just as we did before and just
work<00:03:32.560> a<00:03:32.650> double<00:03:32.859> crochet<00:03:33.010> in<00:03:33.700> the<00:03:33.910> one<00:03:34.060> after

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
work a double crochet in the one after

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:40.500 
work a double crochet in the one after
that<00:03:36.900> like<00:03:37.900> so<00:03:38.700> like<00:03:39.700> I<00:03:39.790> said<00:03:39.880> this<00:03:40.060> is<00:03:40.180> a<00:03:40.209> very

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
that like so like I said this is a very

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.479 
that like so like I said this is a very
small<00:03:40.900> sample<00:03:41.350> but<00:03:41.470> it<00:03:41.590> shows<00:03:41.829> you<00:03:42.069> the<00:03:42.250> stitch

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
small sample but it shows you the stitch

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:45.930 
small sample but it shows you the stitch
pattern<00:03:43.500> alright<00:03:44.500> so<00:03:44.980> we've<00:03:45.190> got<00:03:45.430> our<00:03:45.639> double

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
pattern alright so we've got our double

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:46.770 
pattern alright so we've got our double
crochet<00:03:45.970> there

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
crochet there

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.879 
crochet there
so<00:03:47.380> to<00:03:47.440> begin<00:03:47.859> row<00:03:48.579> two<00:03:49.350> I'm<00:03:50.350> going<00:03:50.500> to<00:03:50.620> chain

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:50.889 
so to begin row two I'm going to chain

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:54.390 
so to begin row two I'm going to chain
three<00:03:51.220> and<00:03:51.250> turn<00:03:52.590> now<00:03:53.590> because<00:03:54.040> I<00:03:54.069> tend<00:03:54.310> to

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
three and turn now because I tend to

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.150 
three and turn now because I tend to
write<00:03:54.519> my<00:03:54.810> instructions<00:03:55.810> in<00:03:56.049> what<00:03:56.260> I<00:03:56.290> think<00:03:56.500> is

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
write my instructions in what I think is

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.309 
write my instructions in what I think is
the<00:03:57.370> most<00:03:57.489> standard<00:03:57.819> way<00:03:58.209> according<00:03:58.569> to<00:03:58.720> yarn

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 
the most standard way according to yarn

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:01.559 
the most standard way according to yarn
standards<00:03:59.920> I<00:04:00.130> always<00:04:00.819> say<00:04:01.000> turn<00:04:01.239> and<00:04:01.480> then

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:01.569 
standards I always say turn and then

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:03.569 
standards I always say turn and then
chain<00:04:01.870> for<00:04:02.410> the<00:04:02.470> next<00:04:02.500> row<00:04:02.889> but<00:04:03.400> I<00:04:03.430> actually

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579 
chain for the next row but I actually

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:05.819 
chain for the next row but I actually
like<00:04:03.849> to<00:04:03.880> chain<00:04:04.180> and<00:04:04.450> then<00:04:04.630> turn<00:04:04.959> I<00:04:05.170> just<00:04:05.410> feel

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:05.829 
like to chain and then turn I just feel

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:07.559 
like to chain and then turn I just feel
it's<00:04:06.010> a<00:04:06.040> little<00:04:06.220> bit<00:04:06.340> easier<00:04:06.370> it<00:04:07.329> doesn't

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:07.569 
it's a little bit easier it doesn't

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:08.610 
it's a little bit easier it doesn't
really<00:04:07.690> matter<00:04:07.870> as<00:04:08.079> long<00:04:08.139> as<00:04:08.260> you're<00:04:08.440> heading

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
really matter as long as you're heading

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:09.900 
really matter as long as you're heading
back<00:04:08.769> the<00:04:08.920> right<00:04:09.069> direction<00:04:09.220> when<00:04:09.579> all<00:04:09.700> said

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
back the right direction when all said

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.110 
back the right direction when all said
and<00:04:10.030> done<00:04:10.090> so<00:04:11.079> now<00:04:11.260> what<00:04:11.980> I'm<00:04:12.130> going<00:04:12.400> to<00:04:12.489> do<00:04:12.819> is

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
and done so now what I'm going to do is

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.180 
and done so now what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:04:13.329> going<00:04:13.359> to<00:04:13.510> work<00:04:13.690> a<00:04:13.959> chain<00:04:14.290> or<00:04:14.739> excuse<00:04:15.010> me<00:04:15.160> a

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
I'm going to work a chain or excuse me a

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.460 
I'm going to work a chain or excuse me a
puff<00:04:15.459> in<00:04:15.760> the<00:04:16.359> chain<00:04:16.599> space<00:04:16.780> remember<00:04:17.260> we

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
puff in the chain space remember we

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:18.810 
puff in the chain space remember we
chained<00:04:17.739> one<00:04:17.979> right<00:04:18.250> before<00:04:18.370> that<00:04:18.579> double

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
chained one right before that double

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.020 
chained one right before that double
crochet<00:04:19.239> so<00:04:20.169> that'll<00:04:20.380> be<00:04:20.470> right<00:04:20.739> here<00:04:21.190> in<00:04:21.820> that

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
crochet so that'll be right here in that

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.690 
crochet so that'll be right here in that
first<00:04:22.360> chain<00:04:22.810> space<00:04:23.099> so<00:04:24.099> I<00:04:24.159> pull<00:04:24.340> up<00:04:24.370> my<00:04:24.520> loops

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
first chain space so I pull up my loops

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.660 
first chain space so I pull up my loops
nice<00:04:24.940> and<00:04:25.150> high<00:04:25.240> again

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
nice and high again

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.920 
nice and high again
yarn<00:04:27.670> over<00:04:27.880> and<00:04:27.910> pull<00:04:28.060> up<00:04:28.270> a<00:04:28.330> loop<00:04:28.420> until<00:04:28.810> I've

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
yarn over and pull up a loop until I've

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.280 
yarn over and pull up a loop until I've
got<00:04:29.110> seven<00:04:29.590> loops<00:04:29.830> on<00:04:30.130> the<00:04:30.400> hook<00:04:30.900> all<00:04:31.900> working

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290 
got seven loops on the hook all working

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:33.750 
got seven loops on the hook all working
right<00:04:32.470> in<00:04:32.590> that<00:04:32.740> chain<00:04:33.010> space<00:04:33.370> so<00:04:33.580> I<00:04:33.610> don't

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
right in that chain space so I don't

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:34.590 
right in that chain space so I don't
need<00:04:33.850> to<00:04:33.910> worry<00:04:34.060> about<00:04:34.210> going<00:04:34.300> into<00:04:34.480> the

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
need to worry about going into the

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.390 
need to worry about going into the
actual<00:04:34.930> chain<00:04:35.140> I<00:04:35.170> can<00:04:35.470> just<00:04:35.620> go<00:04:35.740> in<00:04:35.860> that<00:04:35.950> space

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
actual chain I can just go in that space

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.710 
actual chain I can just go in that space
in<00:04:36.820> between<00:04:37.570> the<00:04:38.080> stitches<00:04:39.150> of<00:04:40.150> course<00:04:40.420> yarn

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
in between the stitches of course yarn

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.370 
in between the stitches of course yarn
over<00:04:41.080> and<00:04:41.820> pull<00:04:42.820> through<00:04:43.000> all<00:04:43.360> then<00:04:43.810> chain<00:04:44.080> one

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
over and pull through all then chain one

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.160 
over and pull through all then chain one
skip<00:04:45.220> the<00:04:45.580> next<00:04:45.850> puff<00:04:46.120> right<00:04:46.420> there<00:04:46.870> when<00:04:47.110> I

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:47.170 
skip the next puff right there when I

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:48.960 
skip the next puff right there when I
could<00:04:47.290> work<00:04:47.440> into<00:04:47.590> the<00:04:47.680> puff<00:04:47.920> this<00:04:48.730> is<00:04:48.850> what

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
could work into the puff this is what

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.000 
could work into the puff this is what
makes<00:04:49.150> this<00:04:49.360> stitch<00:04:49.960> pattern<00:04:50.380> so<00:04:50.650> fun<00:04:50.860> and

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
makes this stitch pattern so fun and

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.650 
makes this stitch pattern so fun and
easy<00:04:51.190> and<00:04:51.520> then<00:04:51.970> we<00:04:52.030> go<00:04:52.150> right<00:04:52.180> into<00:04:52.360> that

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
easy and then we go right into that

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:58.280 
easy and then we go right into that
chain<00:04:52.930> space<00:04:53.290> there<00:04:54.270> and<00:04:55.270> work<00:04:55.420> another<00:04:55.600> puff

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:00.600 

like<00:04:59.290> I<00:04:59.380> said<00:04:59.530> this<00:04:59.620> is<00:04:59.740> obviously<00:05:00.100> a<00:05:00.160> very

like I said this is obviously a very
very<00:05:00.730> small<00:05:01.270> sample<00:05:01.750> really<00:05:02.260> working<00:05:02.650> two

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
very small sample really working two

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.610 
very small sample really working two
puffs<00:05:03.100> per<00:05:03.580> row<00:05:03.790> here<00:05:04.120> in<00:05:04.300> the<00:05:04.380> madly<00:05:05.380> in<00:05:05.590> love

puffs per row here in the madly in love

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.220 
puffs per row here in the madly in love
pattern<00:05:06.430> you<00:05:07.150> would<00:05:07.270> have<00:05:07.420> twenty-one<00:05:07.930> puffs

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:08.230 
pattern you would have twenty-one puffs

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:12.960 
pattern you would have twenty-one puffs
but<00:05:09.130> they're<00:05:09.310> all<00:05:09.430> the<00:05:09.820> same<00:05:10.830> chain<00:05:11.830> one<00:05:12.040> now

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:12.970

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
we come to the end of row two so we've

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:18.240
