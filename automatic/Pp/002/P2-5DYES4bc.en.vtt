this<00:01:55.890> is<00:01:55.950> just<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.310> single<00:01:56.729> sheet<00:01:56.939> bypass

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
this is just a single sheet bypass

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.679 
this is just a single sheet bypass
feeder<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:58.130> to<00:01:59.130> get<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.549> toners<00:02:00.119> there<00:02:00.450> is

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
feeder and to get to the toners there is

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.440 
feeder and to get to the toners there is
a<00:02:00.719> switch<00:02:01.110> here<00:02:01.380> on<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.590> right-hand<00:02:01.770> side

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
a switch here on the right-hand side

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.880 
a switch here on the right-hand side
when<00:02:03.450> you<00:02:03.630> squeeze<00:02:04.439> a<00:02:04.500> switch<00:02:06.170> the<00:02:07.170> lid<00:02:07.560> lifts

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
when you squeeze a switch the lid lifts

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.830 
when you squeeze a switch the lid lifts
up<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:08.310> locks<00:02:08.520> into<00:02:08.789> place<00:02:08.940> like<00:02:09.390> this<00:02:09.660> so

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
up and it locks into place like this so

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.029 
up and it locks into place like this so
you're<00:02:09.959> not<00:02:10.020> going<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.259> trap<00:02:10.470> your<00:02:10.649> fingers

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
you're not going to trap your fingers

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.190 
you're not going to trap your fingers
while<00:02:11.220> you're<00:02:11.640> getting<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.330> toners<00:02:12.780> out<00:02:12.930> so

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
while you're getting the toners out so

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.809 
while you're getting the toners out so
the<00:02:13.290> tone

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
the tone

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.009 
the tone
simply<00:02:14.480> pull<00:02:14.719> out<00:02:14.870> like<00:02:15.109> so<00:02:16.120> you'll<00:02:17.120> notice<00:02:17.719> a

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
simply pull out like so you'll notice a

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:20.800 
simply pull out like so you'll notice a
common<00:02:18.739> theme<00:02:19.040> with<00:02:19.549> a<00:02:19.579> Lexmark<00:02:20.180> design<00:02:20.599> they

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
common theme with a Lexmark design they

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.839 
common theme with a Lexmark design they
do<00:02:20.959> have<00:02:21.200> printers<00:02:21.769> that<00:02:22.310> work<00:02:22.519> in<00:02:22.730> exactly

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 
do have printers that work in exactly

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.479 
do have printers that work in exactly
the<00:02:23.299> same<00:02:23.540> way<00:02:23.870> so<00:02:24.139> there<00:02:24.829> are<00:02:25.099> the<00:02:25.280> four

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
the same way so there are the four

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.270 
the same way so there are the four
toners<00:02:26.180> you<00:02:26.959> could<00:02:27.139> pull<00:02:27.349> the<00:02:27.439> front<00:02:27.680> of<00:02:27.980> the

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
toners you could pull the front of the

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.179 
toners you could pull the front of the
printer<00:02:28.430> down<00:02:28.700> like<00:02:28.999> so<00:02:29.420> and<00:02:29.629> here<00:02:30.469> you<00:02:30.859> have

00:02:31.179 --> 00:02:31.189 
printer down like so and here you have

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:33.520 
printer down like so and here you have
access<00:02:31.790> to<00:02:32.000> where<00:02:32.329> the<00:02:32.450> paper<00:02:32.659> comes<00:02:32.989> out<00:02:33.230> and

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
access to where the paper comes out and

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.009 
access to where the paper comes out and
through<00:02:34.280> and<00:02:34.579> out<00:02:34.969> of<00:02:35.329> the<00:02:35.540> back<00:02:35.780> of<00:02:35.930> the

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
through and out of the back of the

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:38.440 
through and out of the back of the
machine<00:02:36.379> if<00:02:36.680> you<00:02:36.950> get<00:02:37.069> a<00:02:37.099> paper<00:02:37.340> jam<00:02:37.700> you<00:02:38.269> can

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
machine if you get a paper jam you can

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.229 
machine if you get a paper jam you can
access<00:02:38.900> that<00:02:39.109> from<00:02:39.409> there<00:02:39.709> and<00:02:40.010> then<00:02:40.579> let<00:02:41.120> me

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
access that from there and then let me

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:45.789 
access that from there and then let me
just<00:02:41.419> get<00:02:41.599> round<00:02:41.900> this<00:02:42.319> side<00:02:44.109> this<00:02:45.109> side<00:02:45.169> panel

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
just get round this side this side panel

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:50.129 
just get round this side this side panel
comes<00:02:46.040> off<00:02:46.370> so<00:02:46.849> when<00:02:47.209> we<00:02:47.359> take<00:02:47.540> saipin<00:02:48.019> off

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:50.139 
comes off so when we take saipin off

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:55.839 
comes off so when we take saipin off
like<00:02:51.139> so<00:02:53.349> we<00:02:54.349> can<00:02:54.379> get<00:02:54.650> to<00:02:55.069> the<00:02:55.280> waste<00:02:55.489> toner

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:55.849 
like so we can get to the waste toner

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:59.589 
like so we can get to the waste toner
bottle<00:02:56.359> which<00:02:56.900> comes<00:02:57.230> out<00:02:57.969> just<00:02:58.969> by<00:02:59.120> pushing

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
bottle which comes out just by pushing

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:02.409 
bottle which comes out just by pushing
the<00:02:59.959> green<00:03:00.169> switches<00:03:00.590> this<00:03:01.489> is<00:03:01.609> empty<00:03:01.909> when<00:03:02.299> it

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:02.419 
the green switches this is empty when it

00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:03.789 
the green switches this is empty when it
fills<00:03:02.599> up<00:03:02.810> you<00:03:03.139> buy<00:03:03.260> a<00:03:03.290> new<00:03:03.500> one<00:03:03.590> from

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
fills up you buy a new one from

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:06.009 
fills up you buy a new one from
printerbase<00:03:04.099> and<00:03:04.250> you<00:03:05.239> can<00:03:05.359> slot<00:03:05.540> it<00:03:05.689> back<00:03:05.810> in

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
printerbase and you can slot it back in

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:11.379 
printerbase and you can slot it back in
quite<00:03:06.349> easily<00:03:07.480> you<00:03:08.480> also<00:03:08.719> have<00:03:09.319> here<00:03:10.389> the

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:11.389 
quite easily you also have here the

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:14.379 
quite easily you also have here the
imaging<00:03:12.049> kit<00:03:12.500> now<00:03:12.980> you<00:03:13.609> have<00:03:13.790> talked<00:03:14.060> about

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:14.389 
imaging kit now you have talked about

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:17.080 
imaging kit now you have talked about
this<00:03:14.569> previously<00:03:14.989> so<00:03:15.829> the<00:03:16.069> imaging<00:03:16.459> kit<00:03:16.730> is

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
this previously so the imaging kit is

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.140 
this previously so the imaging kit is
what<00:03:18.049> actually<00:03:18.229> cuts<00:03:18.739> the<00:03:19.009> toner<00:03:19.340> onto<00:03:20.060> the

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
what actually cuts the toner onto the

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.659 
what actually cuts the toner onto the
paper<00:03:20.359> itself<00:03:20.870> and<00:03:21.199> they<00:03:22.040> do<00:03:22.159> last<00:03:22.370> quite<00:03:22.609> a

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:22.669 
paper itself and they do last quite a

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:24.789 
paper itself and they do last quite a
long<00:03:22.790> time<00:03:23.120> so<00:03:23.509> most<00:03:23.810> users<00:03:24.259> won't<00:03:24.409> need<00:03:24.650> to

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
long time so most users won't need to

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:26.649 
long time so most users won't need to
replace<00:03:25.099> them<00:03:25.489> where<00:03:25.909> you<00:03:26.000> can<00:03:26.030> see<00:03:26.359> that<00:03:26.569> if

00:03:26.649 --> 00:03:26.659 
replace them where you can see that if

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:28.659 
replace them where you can see that if
you<00:03:26.810> do<00:03:26.959> need<00:03:27.259> to<00:03:27.290> replace<00:03:27.500> them<00:03:27.979> they<00:03:28.489> all

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:28.669 
you do need to replace them they all

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:31.240 
you do need to replace them they all
come<00:03:28.909> out<00:03:29.030> very<00:03:29.239> easily<00:03:29.720> and<00:03:30.199> slot<00:03:30.859> back<00:03:31.069> in

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
come out very easily and slot back in

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:32.740 
come out very easily and slot back in
I'm<00:03:31.400> not<00:03:31.519> going<00:03:31.639> to<00:03:31.699> go<00:03:31.759> into<00:03:32.000> too<00:03:32.239> much<00:03:32.269> detail

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
I'm not going to go into too much detail

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.960 
I'm not going to go into too much detail
on<00:03:33.379> these<00:03:34.189> units<00:03:34.970> here<00:03:35.239> but<00:03:35.689> we<00:03:35.780> do<00:03:36.019> have<00:03:36.379> a<00:03:36.970> cs3

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
on these units here but we do have a cs3

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.240 
on these units here but we do have a cs3
10<00:03:38.329> video<00:03:38.750> which<00:03:39.409> is<00:03:39.620> just<00:03:39.829> the<00:03:39.889> printer

version<00:03:40.549> of<00:03:40.639> this<00:03:40.759> multifunction<00:03:41.540> machine

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
version of this multifunction machine

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.229 
version of this multifunction machine
and<00:03:42.109> I<00:03:42.470> go<00:03:42.650> into<00:03:42.829> quite<00:03:43.220> a<00:03:43.250> lot<00:03:43.519> of<00:03:43.549> detail<00:03:43.819> in

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
and I go into quite a lot of detail in

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:46.390 
and I go into quite a lot of detail in
that<00:03:44.599> video<00:03:44.780> so<00:03:44.930> take<00:03:45.319> a<00:03:45.349> look<00:03:45.650> if<00:03:46.040> you<00:03:46.340> are

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
that video so take a look if you are

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.270 
that video so take a look if you are
interested<00:03:47.299> in<00:03:47.930> the<00:03:48.199> inner<00:03:48.409> workings<00:03:49.009> of<00:03:49.129> this

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
interested in the inner workings of this

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.949 
interested in the inner workings of this
machine<00:03:49.669> so<00:03:49.879> I<00:03:49.909> could<00:03:50.150> just<00:03:50.239> flop<00:03:50.540> this<00:03:50.750> all

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
machine so I could just flop this all

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.979 
machine so I could just flop this all
back<00:03:51.169> together<00:03:51.379> now<00:03:51.799> for<00:03:52.159> you<00:03:52.720> it's<00:03:53.720> just

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
back together now for you it's just

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:55.990 
back together now for you it's just
hopeful<00:03:54.379> gives<00:03:54.620> you<00:03:54.769> a<00:03:54.799> bit<00:03:54.919> of<00:03:55.009> an<00:03:55.099> idea<00:03:55.669> of

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.689 
hopeful gives you a bit of an idea of
how<00:03:56.719> easy<00:03:56.750> this<00:03:57.319> machine<00:03:57.680> is<00:03:57.859> to<00:03:57.889> maintain<00:03:58.519> so

00:03:58.689 --> 00:03:58.699 
how easy this machine is to maintain so

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:00.369 
how easy this machine is to maintain so
they're<00:03:58.819> all<00:03:58.939> color-coded<00:03:59.509> so<00:04:00.019> this<00:04:00.139> is<00:04:00.290> the

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:00.379 
they're all color-coded so this is the

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:02.589 
they're all color-coded so this is the
magenta<00:04:00.949> and<00:04:01.489> that<00:04:01.699> will<00:04:01.819> go<00:04:01.939> into<00:04:02.389> the

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:02.599 
magenta and that will go into the

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:06.420 
magenta and that will go into the
magenta<00:04:03.049> slot<00:04:03.400> okay<00:04:04.400> the<00:04:04.519> black<00:04:04.790> is<00:04:05.229> their

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
magenta slot okay the black is their

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.069 
magenta slot okay the black is their
yellow<00:04:07.430> as<00:04:08.120> you<00:04:08.180> can<00:04:08.419> see<00:04:08.599> it<00:04:08.689> doesn't<00:04:08.840> matter

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:09.079 
yellow as you can see it doesn't matter

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:13.509 
yellow as you can see it doesn't matter
which<00:04:09.409> order<00:04:09.709> you<00:04:10.699> put<00:04:10.879> them<00:04:11.000> in<00:04:11.150> and<00:04:12.519> down

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
which order you put them in and down

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:18.719 
which order you put them in and down
finally<00:04:14.769> we'll<00:04:15.769> pop<00:04:15.979> the<00:04:16.310> side<00:04:17.000> door<00:04:17.299> back<00:04:17.509> on

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:18.729 
finally we'll pop the side door back on

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:23.290 
finally we'll pop the side door back on
close<00:04:19.729> the<00:04:20.299> front<00:04:21.370> as<00:04:22.370> I<00:04:22.520> said<00:04:22.699> this<00:04:22.820> is<00:04:23.029> locked

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
close the front as I said this is locked

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.019 
close the front as I said this is locked
so<00:04:23.690> all<00:04:23.840> we<00:04:23.930> do<00:04:24.050> is<00:04:24.199> squeeze<00:04:24.500> again<00:04:24.919> and<00:04:25.789> goes

00:04:26.019 --> 00:04:26.029 
so all we do is squeeze again and goes

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:27.180 
so all we do is squeeze again and goes
down

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
down

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.160 
down
back<00:04:27.700> into<00:04:27.910> place<00:04:28.120> let<00:04:28.330> me<00:04:28.420> just<00:04:28.600> spin<00:04:28.900> the

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:29.170 
back into place let me just spin the

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.380 
back into place let me just spin the
machine<00:04:29.500> round<00:04:29.800> for<00:04:30.130> you<00:04:30.220> just<00:04:30.430> to<00:04:30.520> take<00:04:30.670> you

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
machine round for you just to take you

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.300 
machine round for you just to take you
for<00:04:31.600> a<00:04:31.660> walk<00:04:31.840> around<00:04:32.020> the<00:04:32.380> machine<00:04:32.710> it's<00:04:32.950> quite

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
for a walk around the machine it's quite

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.960 
for a walk around the machine it's quite
heavy<00:04:33.880> and<00:04:34.690> it<00:04:35.230> has<00:04:35.470> rubber<00:04:35.860> feet<00:04:35.980> so<00:04:36.520> it<00:04:36.760> is

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
heavy and it has rubber feet so it is

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.960 
heavy and it has rubber feet so it is
difficult<00:04:37.270> to<00:04:37.630> spin<00:04:38.020> round<00:04:38.320> there<00:04:39.280> we<00:04:39.520> get<00:04:39.730> so

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
difficult to spin round there we get so

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:41.430 
difficult to spin round there we get so
here's<00:04:40.480> the<00:04:40.600> back<00:04:40.750> of<00:04:40.780> the<00:04:40.900> machine<00:04:41.140> got<00:04:41.350> the

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
here's the back of the machine got the

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.460 
here's the back of the machine got the
network<00:04:41.650> connection<00:04:42.520> there<00:04:42.730> USB<00:04:43.660> and<00:04:43.960> if<00:04:44.380> you

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
network connection there USB and if you

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.230 
network connection there USB and if you
go<00:04:44.590> for<00:04:44.740> the<00:04:44.800> Wi-Fi<00:04:45.220> dongle<00:04:45.490> that<00:04:45.730> just<00:04:46.030> plugs

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
go for the Wi-Fi dongle that just plugs

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.510 
go for the Wi-Fi dongle that just plugs
in<00:04:46.420> there<00:04:46.600> power<00:04:47.350> socket<00:04:47.770> in<00:04:47.920> there

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
in there power socket in there

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.450 
in there power socket in there
spin<00:04:49.090> it<00:04:49.210> around<00:04:49.270> a<00:04:49.390> bit<00:04:49.420> further<00:04:49.750> and<00:04:50.290> you<00:04:51.280> can

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
spin it around a bit further and you can

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.220 
spin it around a bit further and you can
see<00:04:51.640> the<00:04:51.880> power<00:04:52.060> switch<00:04:52.240> there<00:04:52.600> on<00:04:52.780> that<00:04:52.930> side

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.230 
see the power switch there on that side

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
see the power switch there on that side
I<00:04:53.580> think<00:04:54.580> that<00:04:55.560> gives<00:04:56.560> you<00:04:56.740> a<00:04:56.770> bit<00:04:57.010> of<00:04:57.040> an

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
I think that gives you a bit of an

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.610 
I think that gives you a bit of an
overview<00:04:57.580> of<00:04:57.910> the<00:04:58.240> machine<00:04:58.570> if<00:04:58.780> you<00:04:59.440> would

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
overview of the machine if you would

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.410 
overview of the machine if you would
like<00:04:59.800> more<00:04:59.980> information<00:05:00.040> than<00:05:00.760> obviously<00:05:01.210> get

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:01.420 
like more information than obviously get

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:02.700 
like more information than obviously get
