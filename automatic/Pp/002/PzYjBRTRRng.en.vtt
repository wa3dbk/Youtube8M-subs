00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.519

 now from the conclusion of the reunion 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.310
 there is much to tell 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.539
 Anna joined us three years ago 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.300
 Business Informatics started with 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.399
 weekend all roar presence uni do 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.270
 not easy job and study too 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.520
 arrange 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.620
 the study has been twice already 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.840
 extended by a whole semester 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.540
 because you are not at a klausur 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.670
 could attend and on an appointment 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.980
 at the prof, she has to wait almost as long 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.170
 as for your graduation 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.160
 Max is already here but he is 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.199
 dissatisfied 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.539

 graduation as an economic engineer 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.930
 For his career, this has been preserved 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.090
 not worth it and Lisa 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.730
