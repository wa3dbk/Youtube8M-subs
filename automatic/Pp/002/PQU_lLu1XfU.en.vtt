maybe<00:00:55.130> like<00:00:55.310> an<00:00:55.430> H&amp;K<00:00:55.730> for<00:00:56.120> 1/7<00:00:56.540> so<00:00:56.690> find<00:00:56.900> that

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
maybe like an H&amp;K for 1/7 so find that

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.640 
maybe like an H&amp;K for 1/7 so find that
someone's<00:00:57.380> suppressed<00:00:57.740> maybe<00:00:59.500> one<00:01:00.500> of<00:01:00.530> the

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
reasons why we like Medal of Honor so

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.240 
reasons why we like Medal of Honor so
much<00:01:02.450> is<00:01:02.630> because<00:01:02.810> of<00:01:03.050> the<00:01:03.110> realism<00:01:03.440> because

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
much is because of the realism because

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.280 
much is because of the realism because
of<00:01:04.370> the<00:01:04.460> choice<00:01:04.699> of<00:01:04.940> weaponry<00:01:05.270> and<00:01:05.900> because<00:01:06.170> of

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
of the choice of weaponry and because of

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:07.840 
of the choice of weaponry and because of
the<00:01:06.350> realistic<00:01:06.530> nature<00:01:06.890> of<00:01:07.190> the<00:01:07.340> war<00:01:07.490> fighters

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850

the realistic nature of the war fighters
involved<00:01:08.420> and<00:01:08.600> we<00:01:08.720> can<00:01:08.870> really<00:01:09.050> get<00:01:09.260> into<00:01:09.410> a

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
involved and we can really get into a

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.700 
involved and we can really get into a
game<00:01:09.770> that<00:01:09.980> has<00:01:10.430> had<00:01:10.820> very<00:01:11.119> good<00:01:11.810> back-end<00:01:12.380> and

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
game that has had very good back-end and

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.890 
game that has had very good back-end and
consulting<00:01:13.580> to<00:01:13.760> make<00:01:13.910> a<00:01:13.940> very<00:01:14.300> real<00:01:14.690> to<00:01:14.869> life

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
game the video games these days

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.400 
game the video games these days
especially<00:01:17.420> middle<00:01:17.840> one<00:01:18.020> was<00:01:18.140> great<00:01:18.320> because

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:18.410 
especially middle one was great because

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:19.810 
especially middle one was great because
it<00:01:18.590> is<00:01:18.680> so<00:01:18.830> realistic<00:01:19.040> in<00:01:19.369> the<00:01:19.460> war<00:01:19.610> fighting

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
it is so realistic in the war fighting

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.090 
it is so realistic in the war fighting
role<00:01:20.090> what<00:01:20.720> you<00:01:20.840> don't<00:01:21.080> see<00:01:21.320> is<00:01:21.470> I<00:01:21.619> was<00:01:21.740> sort<00:01:22.040> of

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
role what you don't see is I was sort of

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.390 
role what you don't see is I was sort of
I<00:01:22.190> guess

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
I guess

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.250 
I guess
off<00:01:22.580> camera<00:01:22.910> moments<00:01:23.360> like<00:01:23.780> the<00:01:23.900> non<00:01:24.080> war

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 
off camera moments like the non war

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.100 
off camera moments like the non war
fighting<00:01:24.530> I<00:01:24.770> mean<00:01:24.950> war<00:01:25.280> is<00:01:25.460> a<00:01:25.490> 95%<00:01:26.330> boredom<00:01:26.930> and

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
fighting I mean war is a 95% boredom and

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.920 
fighting I mean war is a 95% boredom and
5%<00:01:27.740> kind<00:01:28.280> of<00:01:28.340> controllable<00:01:28.820> action<00:01:29.119> we're

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
5% kind of controllable action we're

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.350 
5% kind of controllable action we're
also<00:01:30.050> really<00:01:30.650> difficult<00:01:30.920> to<00:01:31.460> play<00:01:32.119> video

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
also really difficult to play video

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.940 
also really difficult to play video
games<00:01:32.420> and<00:01:32.810> watch<00:01:32.900> action<00:01:33.470> films<00:01:33.740> with

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
games and watch action films with

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.320 
games and watch action films with
because<00:01:34.820> we<00:01:35.030> sit<00:01:35.210> there<00:01:35.360> and<00:01:35.420> pick<00:01:35.600> it<00:01:35.630> apart

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
because we sit there and pick it apart

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.940 
because we sit there and pick it apart
you<00:01:38.330> couldn't<00:01:38.630> really<00:01:38.810> have<00:01:39.350> a<00:01:39.380> a<00:01:39.650> game

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
you couldn't really have a a game

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.560 
you couldn't really have a a game

featuring<00:01:42.289> Australia<00:01:42.710> I<00:01:42.770> mean<00:01:42.950> it'd<00:01:43.670> just<00:01:43.850> be

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
featuring Australia I mean it'd just be

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.760
