designs here is an example of a design
by<00:00:12.090> minecraft<00:00:12.540> pg5<00:00:13.019> when<00:00:13.889> you<00:00:13.950> press<00:00:14.130> the

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
by minecraft pg5 when you press the

by minecraft pg5 when you press the
button<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.670> door<00:00:14.880> will<00:00:15.030> stay<00:00:15.240> open<00:00:15.269> until<00:00:15.719> you

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.010 
button the door will stay open until you
walk<00:00:16.619> all<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:16.920> way<00:00:16.949> through<00:00:17.190> and<00:00:17.750> I<00:00:18.750> think

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
walk all the way through and I think

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.480 
walk all the way through and I think
it's<00:00:19.140> a<00:00:19.230> really<00:00:19.320> cool<00:00:19.650> design<00:00:19.680> it's<00:00:20.189> super

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
it's a really cool design it's super

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.980 
it's a really cool design it's super
compact<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.180> redstone<00:00:21.539> is<00:00:21.570> really<00:00:21.869> easy

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
compact and the redstone is really easy

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.439 
compact and the redstone is really easy
to<00:00:22.230> wire<00:00:22.380> up<00:00:22.410> but<00:00:23.279> i<00:00:23.430> thought<00:00:23.670> i'd<00:00:23.910> share<00:00:24.180> two

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
to wire up but i thought i'd share two

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.330 
to wire up but i thought i'd share two
designs<00:00:24.810> of<00:00:25.050> my<00:00:25.199> own<00:00:25.350> now<00:00:25.590> these<00:00:26.160> are

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
designs of my own now these are

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.950 
designs of my own now these are
definitely<00:00:26.519> not<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.029> best<00:00:27.269> goodguide<00:00:27.779> door

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
definitely not the best goodguide door

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.660 
definitely not the best goodguide door
designs<00:00:28.289> but<00:00:28.710> they<00:00:28.830> are<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.130> cheapest<00:00:29.519> and

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
designs but they are the cheapest and

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.759 
designs but they are the cheapest and
the<00:00:29.849> most<00:00:29.970> compact<00:00:30.300> that<00:00:30.449> I've<00:00:30.570> seen<00:00:30.840> so<00:00:31.710> you

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
the most compact that I've seen so you

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.200 
the most compact that I've seen so you
can<00:00:31.920> probably<00:00:32.130> tell<00:00:32.550> how<00:00:32.730> it<00:00:32.850> works<00:00:33.000> already

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
can probably tell how it works already

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.120 
can probably tell how it works already
but<00:00:33.690> when<00:00:33.780> you<00:00:33.840> press<00:00:34.050> this<00:00:34.170> button<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.559> error

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
but when you press this button and error

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.770 
but when you press this button and error
was<00:00:35.340> simply<00:00:35.640> shot<00:00:35.820> at<00:00:35.940> that<00:00:35.969> wooden<00:00:36.390> button<00:00:36.660> in

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
was simply shot at that wooden button in

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.720 
was simply shot at that wooden button in
there<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.739> door<00:00:37.860> won't<00:00:38.129> close<00:00:38.190> until<00:00:38.340> you

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
there and the door won't close until you

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.240 
there and the door won't close until you
walk<00:00:38.940> through<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.300> pick<00:00:39.420> up<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.660> arrow<00:00:40.250> the

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
walk through and pick up the arrow the

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.130 
walk through and pick up the arrow the
other<00:00:41.430> design<00:00:41.760> is<00:00:41.969> very<00:00:42.030> similar<00:00:42.450> the

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
other design is very similar the

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.810 
other design is very similar the
dispenser<00:00:43.590> is<00:00:43.739> more<00:00:43.950> hidden<00:00:44.190> but<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.579> button

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
dispenser is more hidden but the button

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.760 
dispenser is more hidden but the button
is<00:00:44.910> placed<00:00:45.149> up<00:00:45.390> here<00:00:45.690> so<00:00:46.320> when<00:00:46.410> you<00:00:46.469> press<00:00:46.649> this

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
is placed up here so when you press this

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.139 
is placed up here so when you press this
button<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.219> arrow<00:00:47.489> is<00:00:47.700> shot<00:00:47.730> at<00:00:48.030> this

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
button and arrow is shot at this

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.060 
button and arrow is shot at this
pressure<00:00:48.420> plate<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.350> works<00:00:49.530> in<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.770> exact

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
pressure plate and it works in the exact

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.610 
pressure plate and it works in the exact
same<00:00:50.250> way<00:00:50.399> so<00:00:50.460> this<00:00:50.789> won't<00:00:51.090> close<00:00:51.989> until<00:00:52.230> you

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
same way so this won't close until you

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.779 
same way so this won't close until you
walk<00:00:52.800> through<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.219> I<00:00:53.280> like<00:00:53.430> this<00:00:53.520> one<00:00:53.610> better

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
walk through and I like this one better

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.130 
walk through and I like this one better
because<00:00:54.180> when<00:00:54.449> you're<00:00:54.539> actually<00:00:54.660> standing<00:00:54.989> on

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
because when you're actually standing on

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.750 
because when you're actually standing on
the<00:00:55.230> pressure<00:00:55.379> plate<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:56.250> door<00:00:56.460> won't<00:00:56.640> close

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
the pressure plate the door won't close

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.279 
the pressure plate the door won't close
until<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.360> go<00:00:57.480> all<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.780> way<00:00:57.809> through<00:00:58.079> and

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
until you go all the way through and

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.830 
until you go all the way through and
these<00:00:58.949> designs<00:00:59.520> are<00:00:59.730> both<00:00:59.910> extremely<00:01:00.270> cheap

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
these designs are both extremely cheap

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.779 
these designs are both extremely cheap
and<00:01:01.020> compact<00:01:01.530> so<00:01:02.160> as<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.340> can<00:01:02.430> see<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:02.760> just

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
and compact so as you can see it just

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.140 
and compact so as you can see it just
fits<00:01:03.149> into<00:01:03.390> this<00:01:03.780> 2<00:01:04.110> x<00:01:04.320> 3<00:01:04.350> x<00:01:04.739> 3<00:01:04.920> area<00:01:05.640> which<00:01:06.000> is

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
fits into this 2 x 3 x 3 area which is

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.460 
fits into this 2 x 3 x 3 area which is
really<00:01:06.360> great<00:01:06.510> i<00:01:06.780> think<00:01:07.049> this<00:01:07.140> is<00:01:07.200> the

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
really great i think this is the

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.170 
really great i think this is the
smallest<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:07.890> can<00:01:07.920> get<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:09.030> actually

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
smallest you can get it and it actually

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.179 
smallest you can get it and it actually
doesn't<00:01:09.540> use<00:01:09.900> any<00:01:10.110> redstone<00:01:10.619> unless<00:01:11.040> you

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
doesn't use any redstone unless you

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.000 
doesn't use any redstone unless you
consider<00:01:11.490> these<00:01:11.820> buttons<00:01:12.119> as<00:01:12.299> dispensers

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
consider these buttons as dispensers

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.550 
consider these buttons as dispensers
redstone<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.790> build<00:01:14.970> them<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:15.330> just<00:01:15.360> need<00:01:15.990> an

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
redstone to build them you just need an

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.410 
redstone to build them you just need an
i<00:01:16.710> endure<00:01:17.009> some<00:01:17.610> building<00:01:17.909> blocks<00:01:17.939> a

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
i endure some building blocks a

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.570 
i endure some building blocks a
dispenser<00:01:18.990> some<00:01:19.560> arrows<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.130> either<00:01:20.430> a

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
dispenser some arrows and either a

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.700 
dispenser some arrows and either a
button<00:01:21.030> or<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.270> pressure<00:01:21.720> plate<00:01:21.869> so<00:01:22.619> they're

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
button or a pressure plate so they're

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.740 
button or a pressure plate so they're
really<00:01:22.920> really<00:01:22.979> simple<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.430> make<00:01:24.060> like<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:24.689> said

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
really really simple to make like I said

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.810 
really really simple to make like I said
I<00:01:25.049> don't<00:01:25.259> believe<00:01:25.560> these<00:01:25.830> are<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.280> best<00:01:26.490> good

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
I don't believe these are the best good

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.429 
I don't believe these are the best good
guide<00:01:26.970> door<00:01:27.150> designs<00:01:27.450> out<00:01:27.570> there<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.960> lot<00:01:28.409> of

guide door designs out there a lot of

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.499 
guide door designs out there a lot of
them<00:01:28.650> such<00:01:28.890> as<00:01:29.009> this<00:01:29.130> one<00:01:29.369> have<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:30.030> lot<00:01:30.299> more

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
them such as this one have a lot more
