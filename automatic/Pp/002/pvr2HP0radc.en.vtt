to make it open um no this is this is

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.270 
to make it open um no this is this is
not<00:02:24.390> a<00:02:24.450> no<00:02:24.630> -<00:02:24.690> this<00:02:25.080> is<00:02:25.200> not<00:02:25.320> your<00:02:25.500> no<00:02:25.800> just<00:02:26.130> use

not a no - this is not your no just use
some<00:02:26.520> similar<00:02:26.880> parts<00:02:27.330> yeah<00:02:27.510> but<00:02:27.660> it<00:02:27.810> yoga<00:02:28.260> tree

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
some similar parts yeah but it yoga tree

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.840 
some similar parts yeah but it yoga tree
is<00:02:28.500> totally<00:02:28.740> different<00:02:29.070> right<00:02:29.280> yeah<00:02:29.670> there's

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
is totally different right yeah there's

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.910 
is totally different right yeah there's
only<00:02:29.940> so<00:02:30.210> many<00:02:30.900> ways<00:02:31.020> you<00:02:31.170> can<00:02:31.470> do<00:02:31.590> something

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
only so many ways you can do something

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.470 
only so many ways you can do something
correctly<00:02:32.010> so<00:02:32.460> there<00:02:32.850> is<00:02:33.030> gonna<00:02:33.210> be<00:02:33.300> some

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
correctly so there is gonna be some

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.300 
correctly so there is gonna be some
things<00:02:33.690> that<00:02:33.840> overlap<00:02:34.110> between<00:02:34.560> our<00:02:34.890> two<00:02:35.100> and

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
things that overlap between our two and

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.740 
things that overlap between our two and
that's<00:02:35.490> basically<00:02:35.910> than<00:02:36.120> you<00:02:36.180> have<00:02:36.300> in<00:02:36.330> a<00:02:36.480> park

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
that's basically than you have in a park

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.810 
that's basically than you have in a park
right<00:02:37.020> that<00:02:38.010> you're<00:02:38.160> gonna<00:02:38.250> have<00:02:38.430> to<00:02:38.520> overlap

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
right that you're gonna have to overlap

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.090 
right that you're gonna have to overlap
some<00:02:39.060> kind<00:02:39.270> of<00:02:39.300> designs<00:02:39.600> so<00:02:39.990> but<00:02:40.500> no<00:02:40.710> we<00:02:40.890> didn't

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
some kind of designs so but no we didn't

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.280

about a hundred of these sitting ready

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.780 
about a hundred of these sitting ready
to<00:03:15.600> go<00:03:15.750> so<00:03:16.110> that<00:03:17.010> for<00:03:17.130> those<00:03:17.190> time<00:03:17.370> to<00:03:17.460> go<00:03:17.550> sold

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.190 
to go so that for those time to go sold
as<00:03:18.180> long<00:03:18.330> as<00:03:18.480> I<00:03:18.510> mean<00:03:18.750> if<00:03:18.840> we<00:03:18.930> don't<00:03:19.080> get

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
as long as I mean if we don't get

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.170 
as long as I mean if we don't get
anything<00:03:19.440> made<00:03:20.280> your<00:03:20.460> feedback<00:03:20.820> then<00:03:21.030> we'll

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
anything made your feedback then we'll

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.120 
anything made your feedback then we'll
keep<00:03:21.270> it<00:03:21.450> and<00:03:21.630> we'll<00:03:21.750> launch<00:03:21.960> it<00:03:22.170> soon<00:03:22.950> after

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
keep it and we'll launch it soon after

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.280 
keep it and we'll launch it soon after
but<00:03:23.850> if<00:03:24.060> we<00:03:24.150> get<00:03:24.300> some<00:03:24.450> requests<00:03:24.900> or<00:03:25.080> whatever

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
but if we get some requests or whatever

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.110 
but if we get some requests or whatever
we'll<00:03:25.530> we'll<00:03:25.920> change<00:03:26.160> it<00:03:26.310> and<00:03:26.460> push<00:03:26.850> it<00:03:26.970> back<00:03:27.000> a

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
we'll we'll change it and push it back a

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.580 
we'll we'll change it and push it back a
little<00:03:27.210> bit<00:03:27.420> and<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:28.050> feed<00:03:28.200> it<00:03:28.320> comes<00:03:28.470> with

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
little bit and the feed it comes with

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:29.690 
little bit and the feed it comes with
fee<00:03:28.710> but<00:03:28.890> they're<00:03:28.980> not<00:03:29.070> on<00:03:29.310> there<00:03:29.490> when<00:03:29.610> you

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
fee but they're not on there when you

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:30.980 
fee but they're not on there when you
get<00:03:29.820> it<00:03:29.940> right<00:03:30.090> you're<00:03:30.240> right<00:03:30.420> among<00:03:30.600> yourself

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:30.990 
get it right you're right among yourself

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:32.540 
get it right you're right among yourself
so<00:03:31.200> you<00:03:31.410> want<00:03:31.560> it<00:03:31.620> to<00:03:31.740> be<00:03:31.890> a<00:03:31.920> little<00:03:32.190> bit<00:03:32.340> more

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
so you want it to be a little bit more

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.000 
so you want it to be a little bit more
sleek<00:03:33.420> but<00:03:33.630> I<00:03:33.660> mean<00:03:33.810> you<00:03:34.110> could<00:03:34.290> use<00:03:34.560> this<00:03:34.770> as<00:03:34.830> a

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
sleek but I mean you could use this as a

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.530 
sleek but I mean you could use this as a
desktop<00:03:35.370> amplifier<00:03:35.940> because<00:03:36.150> it<00:03:36.240> does<00:03:36.360> have<00:03:36.450> a

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
desktop amplifier because it does have a

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.100 
desktop amplifier because it does have a
1<00:03:36.690> or<00:03:36.990> a<00:03:37.020> 15<00:03:37.350> volt<00:03:38.040> input<00:03:38.310> on<00:03:38.520> the<00:03:38.580> back<00:03:38.730> yep<00:03:39.110> you

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
1 or a 15 volt input on the back yep you

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.210 
1 or a 15 volt input on the back yep you
don't<00:03:40.290> have<00:03:40.440> to<00:03:40.560> run<00:03:40.680> those<00:03:40.830> the<00:03:40.890> batteries

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
don't have to run those the batteries

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.860 
don't have to run those the batteries
you<00:03:41.250> can<00:03:41.730> have<00:03:41.940> the<00:03:42.240> betta<00:03:42.390> completely<00:03:42.780> out

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
you can have the betta completely out

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.590 
you can have the betta completely out
and<00:03:42.900> plug<00:03:43.410> in<00:03:43.560> the<00:03:43.650> 15<00:03:43.950> volt<00:03:44.130> power<00:03:44.280> supply<00:03:44.600> and

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
and plug in the 15 volt power supply and

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.270 
and plug in the 15 volt power supply and
have<00:03:45.810> it<00:03:45.990> I<00:03:46.080> mean<00:03:46.380> it's<00:03:46.620> basically<00:03:46.740> you<00:03:47.040> know

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
have it I mean it's basically you know

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.420 
have it I mean it's basically you know
tube<00:03:47.520> that's<00:03:47.960> 30<00:03:48.960> 40<00:03:49.200> bucks<00:03:49.320> cheaper<00:03:49.500> it<00:03:50.100> would

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
tube that's 30 40 bucks cheaper it would

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.130 
tube that's 30 40 bucks cheaper it would
there<00:03:50.550> be<00:03:50.580> a<00:03:50.670> reason<00:03:50.880> to<00:03:51.060> buy<00:03:51.300> an<00:03:51.540> o2<00:03:51.690> over<00:03:52.020> this

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
there be a reason to buy an o2 over this

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.460 
there be a reason to buy an o2 over this
the<00:03:52.680> o2<00:03:52.980> has<00:03:53.370> a<00:03:53.670> little<00:03:53.940> bit<00:03:54.030> more<00:03:54.290> power<00:03:55.290> than

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
the o2 has a little bit more power than

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:56.540 
the o2 has a little bit more power than
this<00:03:55.590> if<00:03:55.710> you<00:03:55.800> want<00:03:55.920> to<00:03:55.950> write<00:03:56.100> something<00:03:56.280> and

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
this if you want to write something and

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.370 
this if you want to write something and
insane<00:03:57.030> but<00:03:57.510> for<00:03:57.960> the<00:03:58.020> majority<00:03:58.200> of

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
insane but for the majority of

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.380 
insane but for the majority of
headphones<00:03:58.710> as<00:03:58.830> you<00:03:58.980> can<00:03:59.130> tell<00:03:59.280> the<00:03:59.550> DTE<00:03:59.850> yeah

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
headphones as you can tell the DTE yeah

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:01.820 
headphones as you can tell the DTE yeah
I'll<00:04:00.630> have<00:04:00.720> to<00:04:00.780> try<00:04:01.050> it<00:04:01.080> with<00:04:01.260> a<00:04:01.320> pair<00:04:01.560> of<00:04:01.590> that

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
I'll have to try it with a pair of that

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.500 
I'll have to try it with a pair of that
are<00:04:01.980> a<00:04:02.010> 600<00:04:02.550> to<00:04:02.610> have<00:04:02.760> more<00:04:02.940> bass<00:04:03.150> because

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
are a 600 to have more bass because

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.450 
are a 600 to have more bass because
that's<00:04:03.660> the<00:04:03.750> thing<00:04:03.960> like<00:04:03.990> sometimes<00:04:04.650> if<00:04:05.280> it

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:05.460 
that's the thing like sometimes if it

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.160 
that's the thing like sometimes if it
doesn't<00:04:05.670> have<00:04:05.760> enough<00:04:05.820> power<00:04:06.240> you'll<00:04:06.900> hear<00:04:07.080> it

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
doesn't have enough power you'll hear it

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.450 
doesn't have enough power you'll hear it
more<00:04:07.290> in<00:04:07.380> the<00:04:07.440> base<00:04:07.710> whereas<00:04:08.130> this<00:04:08.280> is<00:04:08.430> a

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:08.460 
more in the base whereas this is a

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.850 
more in the base whereas this is a
treble<00:04:08.880> cannon<00:04:09.210> right<00:04:09.510> so<00:04:10.020> I<00:04:10.050> don't<00:04:10.530> have<00:04:10.650> any

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
treble cannon right so I don't have any

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:11.930 
treble cannon right so I don't have any
600<00:04:11.340> ohm

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
600 ohm

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.740 
600 ohm
you<00:04:12.300> know<00:04:12.450> bassy<00:04:13.020> headphones<00:04:13.790> but<00:04:14.790> it<00:04:15.390> sounded

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
you know bassy headphones but it sounded

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.030 
you know bassy headphones but it sounded
pretty<00:04:15.870> good<00:04:16.020> and<00:04:16.350> cleaned<00:04:16.620> it<00:04:16.770> sounded

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
pretty good and cleaned it sounded

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.039 
pretty good and cleaned it sounded
almost<00:04:17.160> like<00:04:17.430> the<00:04:17.549> o2<00:04:17.700> but<00:04:18.150> again<00:04:18.390> treble

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
almost like the o2 but again treble

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.220 
almost like the o2 but again treble
cannon<00:04:19.380> so<00:04:19.970> maybe<00:04:20.970> the<00:04:21.120> o2<00:04:21.390> if<00:04:21.510> you<00:04:21.600> have<00:04:21.750> 600

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.230 
cannon so maybe the o2 if you have 600

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.560 
cannon so maybe the o2 if you have 600
ohm<00:04:22.490> LCD<00:04:23.490> 2's<00:04:23.730> or<00:04:23.940> something<00:04:24.210> like<00:04:24.300> that

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
ohm LCD 2's or something like that

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.410 
ohm LCD 2's or something like that
right<00:04:24.780> yes<00:04:25.200> even<00:04:25.530> 600<00:04:25.740> ohm<00:04:25.980> no<00:04:26.640> they<00:04:26.910> are<00:04:27.090> low

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
right yes even 600 ohm no they are low

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.030 
right yes even 600 ohm no they are low
impedance<00:04:28.350> and<00:04:28.620> they're<00:04:28.710> also<00:04:28.830> low

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
impedance and they're also low

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.200 
impedance and they're also low
sensitivity<00:04:29.310> that's<00:04:29.670> what<00:04:29.790> makes<00:04:29.940> them<00:04:30.000> hard

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
sensitivity that's what makes them hard

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.330 
sensitivity that's what makes them hard
to<00:04:30.240> drive<00:04:30.450> so<00:04:30.890> we<00:04:31.890> get<00:04:32.010> to<00:04:32.100> give<00:04:32.190> these<00:04:32.310> things

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
to drive so we get to give these things

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.900 
to drive so we get to give these things
away<00:04:32.520> right

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
away right

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.850 
away right
yes<00:04:33.060> one<00:04:33.480> of<00:04:33.510> them<00:04:33.690> right<00:04:33.810> one<00:04:34.020> yep<00:04:34.290> all<00:04:34.740> right

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
yes one of them right one yep all right
