to<00:00:17.070> be<00:00:17.190> a<00:00:17.220> pretty<00:00:17.430> basic<00:00:17.609> video<00:00:18.090> so<00:00:18.390> all<00:00:18.539> I<00:00:18.570> have

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
to be a pretty basic video so all I have

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.460 
to be a pretty basic video so all I have
is<00:00:19.260> I'm<00:00:19.770> using<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.130> crushed<00:00:20.369> walnut<00:00:20.910> for<00:00:21.359> a

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470 
is I'm using the crushed walnut for a

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.990 
is I'm using the crushed walnut for a
base<00:00:22.470> you<00:00:22.680> could<00:00:22.859> probably<00:00:23.070> use<00:00:23.310> sand<00:00:23.670> I<00:00:23.789> just

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
base you could probably use sand I just

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.460 
base you could probably use sand I just
use<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.150> crushed<00:00:24.449> walnut<00:00:24.900> because<00:00:25.080> I<00:00:25.140> find<00:00:25.350> it's

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
use a crushed walnut because I find it's

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.859 
use a crushed walnut because I find it's
not<00:00:25.619> too<00:00:25.769> dusty<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.580> doesn't<00:00:27.210> every<00:00:27.689> time

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
not too dusty and doesn't every time

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.349 
not too dusty and doesn't every time
that<00:00:28.019> I<00:00:28.080> go<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.260> scoop<00:00:28.590> it<00:00:28.710> up<00:00:28.890> it<00:00:29.550> doesn't<00:00:29.939> like

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
that I go to scoop it up it doesn't like

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.720 
that I go to scoop it up it doesn't like
make<00:00:30.660> all<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.109> sand<00:00:31.380> start<00:00:32.130> flying<00:00:32.430> in<00:00:32.640> the

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
make all the sand start flying in the

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.990 
make all the sand start flying in the
air<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.090> then<00:00:33.180> get<00:00:33.390> dust<00:00:33.690> everywhere<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:35.000> as

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
air and then get dust everywhere and as

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.250 
air and then get dust everywhere and as
long<00:00:36.180> as<00:00:36.300> they're<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.450> decent<00:00:36.840> size<00:00:37.020> you

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
long as they're a decent size you

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.389 
long as they're a decent size you
shouldn't<00:00:37.620> really<00:00:37.739> have<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:38.070> worry<00:00:38.250> about

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
shouldn't really have to worry about

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.760 
shouldn't really have to worry about
impactions<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.420> I<00:00:39.930> feed<00:00:40.170> them<00:00:40.290> from<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.559> bowl

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
impactions and I feed them from a bowl

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.330 
impactions and I feed them from a bowl
as<00:00:41.040> well<00:00:41.180> so<00:00:42.180> that<00:00:42.480> they<00:00:43.140> don't<00:00:43.350> eat<00:00:43.559> they<00:00:43.980> make

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
as well so that they don't eat they make

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.770 
as well so that they don't eat they make
it<00:00:44.489> some<00:00:44.760> sand<00:00:45.030> in<00:00:45.180> them<00:00:45.300> but<00:00:45.450> for<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.660> most

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
it some sand in them but for the most

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.080 
it some sand in them but for the most
part<00:00:45.930> they're<00:00:46.200> not<00:00:46.320> going<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.500> get<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.649> lot<00:00:47.090> and

personally<00:01:53.549> use<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:53.880> on<00:01:54.000> 12<00:01:54.299> because<00:01:54.659> they'll

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
personally use it on 12 because they'll

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.270 
personally use it on 12 because they'll
go<00:01:54.990> in<00:01:55.170> there<00:01:55.350> hide<00:01:55.500> if<00:01:55.740> they<00:01:55.860> don't<00:01:56.040> want<00:01:56.189> to

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
go in there hide if they don't want to

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.679 
go in there hide if they don't want to
bask<00:01:56.430> anymore<00:01:57.500> and<00:01:58.610> I<00:01:59.610> used<00:01:59.880> it<00:02:00.090> at<00:02:00.299> they

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
bask anymore and I used it at they

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.359 
bask anymore and I used it at they
should<00:02:00.930> start<00:02:01.229> basking<00:02:01.740> more<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.009> more<00:02:02.189> as

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
should start basking more and more as

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.800 
should start basking more and more as
they<00:02:02.579> get<00:02:02.790> more<00:02:02.850> used<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.420> because<00:02:03.689> they've

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
they get more used to it because they've

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.330 
they get more used to it because they've
only<00:02:03.899> been<00:02:04.170> in<00:02:04.290> here<00:02:04.320> for<00:02:04.619> a<00:02:04.649> few<00:02:04.890> days<00:02:04.920> now<00:02:05.310> I

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
only been in here for a few days now I

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.670 
only been in here for a few days now I
also<00:02:05.700> have<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:06.360> I've<00:02:06.780> been<00:02:06.869> using<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.259> bulb<00:02:07.500> on

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
also have it I've been using the bulb on

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.279 
also have it I've been using the bulb on
my<00:02:07.860> beardies<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:08.610> it's<00:02:09.149> exact<00:02:09.479> same<00:02:09.720> bulb<00:02:09.989> and

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
my beardies and it's exact same bulb and

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.559 
my beardies and it's exact same bulb and
I've<00:02:10.709> had<00:02:10.890> it<00:02:10.920> for<00:02:11.220> probably<00:02:11.310> about<00:02:11.580> a

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
I've had it for probably about a

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.899 
I've had it for probably about a
at<00:02:12.629> least<00:02:12.840> vote<00:02:13.159> three<00:02:14.159> or<00:02:14.249> four<00:02:14.430> months<00:02:14.730> now

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:14.909 
at least vote three or four months now

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:18.619 
at least vote three or four months now
and<00:02:15.620> it<00:02:16.620> works<00:02:16.769> great<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.639> only<00:02:17.849> problem<00:02:18.239> is<00:02:18.359> a

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
and it works great the only problem is a

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:20.780 
and it works great the only problem is a
lot<00:02:18.989> of<00:02:19.109> people<00:02:19.409> I<00:02:19.709> guess<00:02:20.069> they<00:02:20.459> think<00:02:20.519> it

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
lot of people I guess they think it

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.280 
lot of people I guess they think it
burns<00:02:21.030> out<00:02:21.269> but<00:02:21.540> it<00:02:21.629> doesn't<00:02:21.900> actually<00:02:21.989> burn

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
burns out but it doesn't actually burn

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.869 
burns out but it doesn't actually burn
out<00:02:22.409> when<00:02:22.530> you<00:02:22.620> turn<00:02:22.769> it<00:02:22.920> off<00:02:23.010> you<00:02:23.219> have<00:02:23.249> to<00:02:23.370> if

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 
out when you turn it off you have to if

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:25.970 
out when you turn it off you have to if
you<00:02:23.999> turn<00:02:24.209> it<00:02:24.299> off<00:02:24.450> when<00:02:24.629> it's<00:02:24.780> warm<00:02:25.079> I'll<00:02:25.769> do

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
you turn it off when it's warm I'll do

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.679 
you turn it off when it's warm I'll do
it<00:02:26.099> right<00:02:26.249> now<00:02:26.489> as<00:02:26.760> you<00:02:27.030> can<00:02:27.150> see<00:02:27.209> here's<00:02:27.629> the

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:27.689 
it right now as you can see here's the

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:30.890 
it right now as you can see here's the
thing<00:02:27.810> a<00:02:28.019> switch<00:02:28.469> when<00:02:29.099> you<00:02:29.129> turn<00:02:29.219> it<00:02:29.519> off<00:02:29.900> and

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
thing a switch when you turn it off and

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.720 
thing a switch when you turn it off and
you<00:02:31.019> go<00:02:31.109> to<00:02:31.170> turn<00:02:31.319> it<00:02:31.469> back<00:02:31.620> on<00:02:31.650> it<00:02:32.159> won't<00:02:32.370> turn

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
you go to turn it back on it won't turn

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.759 
you go to turn it back on it won't turn
back<00:02:33.000> on<00:02:33.239> but<00:02:33.629> what<00:02:33.780> you<00:02:33.810> have<00:02:34.079> to<00:02:34.109> do<00:02:34.349> is<00:02:34.560> wait

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
back on but what you have to do is wait

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.289 
back on but what you have to do is wait
for<00:02:34.799> it<00:02:35.010> to<00:02:35.159> cool<00:02:35.340> down<00:02:35.400> it'll<00:02:36.120> take

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
for it to cool down it'll take

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:39.170 
for it to cool down it'll take
approximately<00:02:36.420> ten<00:02:37.349> minutes<00:02:37.379> or<00:02:37.859> so<00:02:37.889> and<00:02:38.280> then

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
approximately ten minutes or so and then

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.179 
approximately ten minutes or so and then
after<00:02:39.840> its<00:02:39.989> cooled<00:02:40.290> down<00:02:40.560> you'll<00:02:40.829> be<00:02:40.859> able<00:02:40.980> to

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:41.189 
after its cooled down you'll be able to

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:42.559 
after its cooled down you'll be able to
turn<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.459> light<00:02:41.609> back<00:02:41.790> on<00:02:42.030> because<00:02:42.239> as<00:02:42.419> you

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
turn the light back on because as you

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.720 
turn the light back on because as you
can<00:02:42.659> see<00:02:42.719> the<00:02:43.650> light's<00:02:43.889> not<00:02:44.099> turning<00:02:44.459> on<00:02:44.579> at

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
can see the light's not turning on at

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:45.140 
can see the light's not turning on at
all

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
all

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.440 
all
that's<00:02:45.959> just<00:02:46.319> how<00:02:46.439> I<00:02:46.469> turned<00:02:46.799> it<00:02:46.919> off<00:02:47.450> I'll

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
that's just how I turned it off I'll

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.119 
that's just how I turned it off I'll
actually<00:02:48.719> turn<00:02:49.079> off<00:02:49.109> this<00:02:49.379> video<00:02:49.560> and<00:02:49.950> come

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:50.129 
actually turn off this video and come

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:51.920 
actually turn off this video and come
back<00:02:50.250> in<00:02:50.519> ten<00:02:50.699> minutes<00:02:50.879> and<00:02:51.269> turn<00:02:51.599> it<00:02:51.719> back<00:02:51.780> on

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
back in ten minutes and turn it back on

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.170 
back in ten minutes and turn it back on
and<00:02:52.409> the<00:02:53.010> light<00:02:53.189> will<00:02:53.370> actually<00:02:53.519> turn<00:02:53.790> back<00:02:54.000> on

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
and the light will actually turn back on

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.369 
and the light will actually turn back on
but<00:02:54.329> what<00:02:54.449> you're<00:02:54.540> gonna<00:02:54.659> need<00:02:54.840> to<00:02:54.959> do<00:02:55.079> is<00:02:55.230> make

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:55.379 
but what you're gonna need to do is make

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:57.439 
but what you're gonna need to do is make
sure<00:02:55.409> that<00:02:55.590> you<00:02:55.799> either<00:02:55.949> unplug<00:02:56.519> the<00:02:56.699> light<00:02:56.909> or

00:02:57.439 --> 00:02:57.449 
sure that you either unplug the light or

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:59.750 
sure that you either unplug the light or
turn<00:02:57.780> it<00:02:57.930> off<00:02:58.079> and<00:02:58.379> then<00:02:58.439> turn<00:02:59.219> it<00:02:59.370> back<00:02:59.400> on

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
turn it off and then turn it back on

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.240 
turn it off and then turn it back on
because<00:02:59.969> the<00:03:00.209> light<00:03:00.359> just<00:03:00.629> won't<00:03:00.840> come<00:03:01.019> on

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
because the light just won't come on

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.830 
because the light just won't come on
actually<00:03:02.250> I<00:03:02.280> can't<00:03:02.879> guarantee<00:03:03.120> that<00:03:03.359> it<00:03:03.629> may

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
actually I can't guarantee that it may

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.509 
actually I can't guarantee that it may
just<00:03:04.079> come<00:03:04.260> back<00:03:04.409> on<00:03:04.469> by<00:03:04.799> itself<00:03:05.069> actually<00:03:05.340> I

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
just come back on by itself actually I

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.640 
just come back on by itself actually I
guess<00:03:05.669> I<00:03:05.790> can<00:03:05.939> just<00:03:05.969> try<00:03:06.359> I'm<00:03:06.599> gonna<00:03:06.810> set<00:03:07.530> that

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
guess I can just try I'm gonna set that

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.649 
guess I can just try I'm gonna set that
down<00:03:07.919> but<00:03:08.609> I<00:03:08.639> know<00:03:08.730> for<00:03:09.000> a<00:03:09.030> fact<00:03:09.090> that<00:03:09.359> if<00:03:09.569> you

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:09.659 
down but I know for a fact that if you

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:11.300 
down but I know for a fact that if you
turn<00:03:09.870> it<00:03:09.989> off<00:03:10.109> or<00:03:10.349> unplug<00:03:10.469> the<00:03:10.829> light<00:03:11.010> and<00:03:11.189> wait

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
turn it off or unplug the light and wait

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.879 
turn it off or unplug the light and wait
ten<00:03:11.549> minutes<00:03:11.699> it'll<00:03:12.180> come<00:03:12.449> back<00:03:12.480> on<00:03:12.659> but<00:03:13.620> I'm

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:13.889 
ten minutes it'll come back on but I'm

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:15.470 
ten minutes it'll come back on but I'm
just<00:03:13.980> gonna<00:03:14.129> leave<00:03:14.370> it<00:03:14.430> on<00:03:14.639> and<00:03:14.909> see<00:03:15.090> if<00:03:15.120> it

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
just gonna leave it on and see if it

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.809 
just gonna leave it on and see if it
comes<00:03:15.719> back<00:03:15.870> on<00:03:16.079> automatically<00:03:16.799> if<00:03:17.489> it

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
comes back on automatically if it

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.390 
comes back on automatically if it
doesn't<00:03:18.239> then<00:03:18.680> that's<00:03:19.680> probably<00:03:19.949> one<00:03:20.250> of<00:03:20.280> the

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
doesn't then that's probably one of the

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.219 
doesn't then that's probably one of the
reasons<00:03:20.699> why<00:03:20.970> a<00:03:21.000> lot<00:03:21.269> of<00:03:21.419> people<00:03:21.540> are<00:03:21.840> bitching

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:22.229 
reasons why a lot of people are bitching

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:24.439 
reasons why a lot of people are bitching
but<00:03:22.709> uh<00:03:22.739> if<00:03:23.340> you<00:03:23.489> figure<00:03:23.790> it<00:03:23.909> out

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:24.449 
but uh if you figure it out

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:26.210 
but uh if you figure it out
if<00:03:24.870> you<00:03:24.959> just<00:03:25.079> wait<00:03:25.229> the<00:03:25.409> 10<00:03:25.590> minutes<00:03:25.919> and<00:03:26.099> then

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
if you just wait the 10 minutes and then

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.490 
if you just wait the 10 minutes and then
turn<00:03:26.579> it<00:03:26.639> back<00:03:26.849> on<00:03:27.030> it'll<00:03:27.359> turn<00:03:27.509> on<00:03:27.750> and<00:03:28.019> these

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
turn it back on it'll turn on and these

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.800 
turn it back on it'll turn on and these
bulbs<00:03:28.739> last<00:03:29.009> forever<00:03:29.250> there<00:03:29.699> I<00:03:30.120> believe

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
bulbs last forever there I believe

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.860 
bulbs last forever there I believe
mercury<00:03:31.500> vapor<00:03:31.739> bulbs<00:03:32.250> and<00:03:32.509> they<00:03:33.509> are<00:03:33.599> so

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
mercury vapor bulbs and they are so

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.140 
mercury vapor bulbs and they are so
ballast<00:03:34.409> so<00:03:34.799> I<00:03:35.099> don't<00:03:35.519> know<00:03:35.579> they're<00:03:35.819> just<00:03:35.849> you

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
ballast so I don't know they're just you

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.349 
ballast so I don't know they're just you
just<00:03:36.269> throw<00:03:36.599> them<00:03:36.750> right<00:03:36.810> into<00:03:37.199> the<00:03:38.359> regular

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
just throw them right into the regular

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:42.499 
just throw them right into the regular
heat<00:03:39.780> lamp<00:03:40.019> thing<00:03:40.259> you<00:03:40.409> can<00:03:40.590> buy<00:03:40.739> a<00:03:41.239> large<00:03:42.239> one

00:03:42.499 --> 00:03:42.509 
heat lamp thing you can buy a large one

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:44.089 
heat lamp thing you can buy a large one
I<00:03:42.540> peed<00:03:42.810> thirty<00:03:43.109> four<00:03:43.349> dollars<00:03:43.530> from<00:03:43.919> this

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099 
I peed thirty four dollars from this

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:48.800 
I peed thirty four dollars from this
from<00:03:44.370> a<00:03:44.400> big<00:03:44.790> house<00:03:44.939> and<00:03:47.000> it's<00:03:48.000> like<00:03:48.209> the<00:03:48.449> super

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
from a big house and it's like the super

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.110 
from a big house and it's like the super
large<00:03:49.379> dome<00:03:49.709> that<00:03:50.009> will<00:03:50.489> actually<00:03:50.879> have<00:03:51.090> a

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
large dome that will actually have a

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.960 
large dome that will actually have a
house<00:03:51.449> the<00:03:51.720> bulb<00:03:51.930> and<00:03:52.109> give<00:03:52.259> you<00:03:52.409> some<00:03:52.620> extra

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
house the bulb and give you some extra

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.209 
house the bulb and give you some extra
space<00:03:54.079> so<00:03:55.079> that<00:03:55.259> you<00:03:55.349> don't<00:03:55.530> need<00:03:55.650> to<00:03:55.709> cut<00:03:56.099> the

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:56.219 
space so that you don't need to cut the

00:03:56.219 --> 00:04:00.199 
space so that you don't need to cut the
screen<00:03:56.400> or<00:03:56.669> anything<00:03:57.680> and<00:03:58.819> yeah<00:03:59.819> I<00:03:59.849> don't<00:04:00.060> know

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
screen or anything and yeah I don't know

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.089 
screen or anything and yeah I don't know
that's<00:04:00.389> about<00:04:00.569> it<00:04:00.840> so<00:04:01.109> I'm<00:04:01.439> gonna<00:04:01.620> be<00:04:01.769> back<00:04:01.919> in

then for the ball all I do is just place
it<00:05:02.350> on<00:05:02.620> top<00:05:02.830> and<00:05:03.160> then<00:05:03.250> have<00:05:03.910> the<00:05:04.240> log<00:05:04.630> on<00:05:05.020> a

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
it on top and then have the log on a

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.860 
it on top and then have the log on a
angle<00:05:06.100> so<00:05:06.640> that<00:05:06.670> they<00:05:06.970> can<00:05:07.180> go<00:05:07.360> higher<00:05:07.570> and

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
angle so that they can go higher and

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.230 
angle so that they can go higher and
lower<00:05:08.050> on<00:05:08.380> the<00:05:08.830> so<00:05:09.580> you<00:05:09.640> get<00:05:09.760> more<00:05:09.940> heat<00:05:10.120> and

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
lower on the so you get more heat and

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.080 
lower on the so you get more heat and
less<00:05:10.510> heat<00:05:10.750> and<00:05:11.100> they<00:05:12.100> can<00:05:12.250> also<00:05:12.370> go<00:05:12.610> down<00:05:12.760> here

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
less heat and they can also go down here

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.580 
less heat and they can also go down here
and<00:05:13.240> then<00:05:13.360> on<00:05:13.480> this<00:05:13.510> side<00:05:13.690> I<00:05:13.870> have<00:05:14.110> absolutely

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
and then on this side I have absolutely

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.230 
and then on this side I have absolutely
nothing<00:05:14.800> I<00:05:15.070> don't<00:05:15.220> have<00:05:15.340> any<00:05:15.520> heat<00:05:15.790> maps<00:05:16.030> on

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
nothing I don't have any heat maps on

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.780 
nothing I don't have any heat maps on
the<00:05:16.330> bottom<00:05:16.630> or<00:05:16.720> anything<00:05:17.310> on<00:05:18.310> this<00:05:18.460> side<00:05:18.640> this

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:18.790 
the bottom or anything on this side this

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:20.520 
the bottom or anything on this side this
is<00:05:18.850> the<00:05:19.000> cool<00:05:19.360> side<00:05:19.600> so<00:05:19.930> if<00:05:20.050> they're<00:05:20.200> too<00:05:20.320> hot

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
is the cool side so if they're too hot

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.050 
is the cool side so if they're too hot
from<00:05:20.830> over<00:05:21.100> here<00:05:21.280> they<00:05:21.490> can<00:05:21.610> just<00:05:21.760> move<00:05:21.940> over

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.060 
from over here they can just move over

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.660 
from over here they can just move over
here<00:05:22.480> and<00:05:22.630> cool<00:05:22.900> down<00:05:23.140> on<00:05:23.620> average<00:05:24.340> my<00:05:24.520> house

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:24.670 
here and cool down on average my house

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:28.890 
here and cool down on average my house
is<00:05:24.850> probably<00:05:25.060> about<00:05:25.450> 24<00:05:26.050> so<00:05:27.120> like<00:05:28.120> the<00:05:28.360> base

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
is probably about 24 so like the base

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.360 
is probably about 24 so like the base
temperature<00:05:29.410> I<00:05:29.440> keep<00:05:29.950> them<00:05:30.070> that<00:05:30.160> would<00:05:30.340> be

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
temperature I keep them that would be

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.030 
temperature I keep them that would be
around<00:05:31.030> 24<00:05:31.480> degrees<00:05:31.810> they<00:05:32.110> can<00:05:32.290> go<00:05:32.440> higher<00:05:32.650> my

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:33.040 
around 24 degrees they can go higher my

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.220 
around 24 degrees they can go higher my
house<00:05:33.310> goes<00:05:33.880> all<00:05:34.060> the<00:05:34.090> way<00:05:34.210> up<00:05:34.390> to<00:05:34.510> like<00:05:34.630> 26

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:35.230 
house goes all the way up to like 26

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:38.370 
house goes all the way up to like 26
sometimes<00:05:36.300> 26<00:05:37.300> degrees<00:05:37.660> Celsius

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
sometimes 26 degrees Celsius

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:42.090 
sometimes 26 degrees Celsius
um<00:05:38.440> and<00:05:39.420> then<00:05:40.420> for<00:05:40.690> the<00:05:40.840> light<00:05:41.290> they<00:05:41.590> will<00:05:41.800> just

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:42.100 
um and then for the light they will just

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.460 
um and then for the light they will just
adjust<00:05:42.850> their<00:05:43.180> temperature<00:05:43.570> themselves<00:05:44.140> by

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.470 
adjust their temperature themselves by

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.890 
adjust their temperature themselves by
going<00:05:45.040> up<00:05:45.160> and<00:05:45.280> down<00:05:45.430> the<00:05:45.580> log<00:05:45.760> and<00:05:46.090> moving<00:05:46.780> on

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
going up and down the log and moving on

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.410 
going up and down the log and moving on
the<00:05:47.020> sand<00:05:47.260> or<00:05:47.410> wherever<00:05:47.590> they<00:05:47.830> want<00:05:48.040> to<00:05:48.160> bask

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:48.420 
the sand or wherever they want to bask

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:51.750 
the sand or wherever they want to bask
so<00:05:49.420> for<00:05:49.780> the<00:05:49.870> most<00:05:50.050> part<00:05:50.320> I<00:05:50.700> wouldn't<00:05:51.700> even

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:51.760 
so for the most part I wouldn't even

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.120 
so for the most part I wouldn't even
recommend<00:05:52.410> checking<00:05:53.410> the<00:05:53.710> temperature<00:05:54.040> of

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.130 
recommend checking the temperature of

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:55.350 
recommend checking the temperature of
the<00:05:54.220> heat<00:05:54.400> you<00:05:54.430> can<00:05:54.730> if<00:05:54.820> you<00:05:54.910> want<00:05:55.090> though

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 
the heat you can if you want though

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.850 
the heat you can if you want though
because<00:05:55.690> if<00:05:55.810> it's<00:05:55.960> too<00:05:56.140> hot<00:05:56.350> they<00:05:56.560> will<00:05:56.590> just

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:56.860 
because if it's too hot they will just

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:58.440 
because if it's too hot they will just
lay<00:05:57.040> they<00:05:57.250> won't<00:05:57.430> ever<00:05:57.580> bask<00:05:57.940> and<00:05:58.270> then<00:05:58.360> if

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:58.450 
lay they won't ever bask and then if

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:59.760 
lay they won't ever bask and then if
they're<00:05:58.600> doing<00:05:58.720> that<00:05:58.870> you<00:05:59.110> most<00:05:59.320> likely<00:05:59.590> know

00:05:59.760 --> 00:05:59.770 
they're doing that you most likely know

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:03.810 
they're doing that you most likely know
that<00:06:00.280> it's<00:06:00.910> too<00:06:01.240> hot<00:06:01.450> for<00:06:01.690> them<00:06:02.640> yeah<00:06:03.640> I<00:06:03.670> don't

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:03.820 
that it's too hot for them yeah I don't

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:05.570 
that it's too hot for them yeah I don't
know<00:06:04.000> that's<00:06:04.180> pretty<00:06:04.360> much<00:06:04.510> it<00:06:04.750> my<00:06:04.900> tank<00:06:05.230> is<00:06:05.500> a

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.580 
know that's pretty much it my tank is a

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.330 
know that's pretty much it my tank is a
36<00:06:06.580> by<00:06:07.030> 12<00:06:07.840> verse<00:06:08.200> I<00:06:08.530> mean<00:06:08.740> I<00:06:08.770> don't<00:06:09.070> even<00:06:09.190> know

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:09.340 
36 by 12 verse I mean I don't even know

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.550 
36 by 12 verse I mean I don't even know
something<00:06:09.700> like<00:06:09.820> that<00:06:10.030> something<00:06:10.960> you<00:06:11.470> know<00:06:11.530> I

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:11.560 
something like that something you know I

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.210 
something like that something you know I
think<00:06:11.680> it's<00:06:11.920> like<00:06:11.980> 36<00:06:12.460> by<00:06:12.640> 18<00:06:13.090> and<00:06:13.380> then<00:06:14.380> I<00:06:14.890> may

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:15.220 
think it's like 36 by 18 and then I may

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:17.580 
think it's like 36 by 18 and then I may
upgrade<00:06:15.670> them<00:06:15.850> to<00:06:15.880> like<00:06:16.120> a<00:06:16.150> 46<00:06:16.810> one<00:06:17.080> that's

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:17.590 
upgrade them to like a 46 one that's

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:20.730 
upgrade them to like a 46 one that's
recommended<00:06:19.170> yeah<00:06:20.170> I<00:06:20.200> don't<00:06:20.380> know<00:06:20.530> that's

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:20.740 
recommended yeah I don't know that's

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.830 
recommended yeah I don't know that's
about<00:06:20.920> it<00:06:21.130> I<00:06:21.160> have<00:06:21.520> a<00:06:21.850> bunch<00:06:22.240> more<00:06:22.300> stuff<00:06:22.690> on

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:22.840 
about it I have a bunch more stuff on

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.570 
about it I have a bunch more stuff on
the<00:06:22.900> way<00:06:23.110> I<00:06:23.140> got<00:06:23.500> a<00:06:23.530> new<00:06:23.740> hand<00:06:23.920> below<00:06:24.190> we<00:06:24.340> paint

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:24.580 
the way I got a new hand below we paint

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:25.830 
the way I got a new hand below we paint
the<00:06:24.730> community<00:06:25.150> and<00:06:25.240> I<00:06:25.300> got<00:06:25.420> a<00:06:25.450> bunch<00:06:25.660> of<00:06:25.720> new

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.840

stuff<00:06:26.110> so<00:06:26.440> I<00:06:26.710> don't<00:06:27.220> know<00:06:27.340> I<00:06:27.400> guess<00:06:27.550> I'll<00:06:27.700> be

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:27.790 
stuff so I don't know I guess I'll be

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:29.720 
stuff so I don't know I guess I'll be
making<00:06:28.060> more<00:06:28.180> videos<00:06:28.240> and<00:06:28.870> I<00:06:28.990> also<00:06:29.110> have<00:06:29.380> some

hopefully I'm going to be getting some

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:33.930 
hopefully I'm going to be getting some
