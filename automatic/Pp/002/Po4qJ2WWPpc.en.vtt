 very important breakfast that goes 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.989
 bring you the necessary forces to 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.299
 start the day

 you can eat a grain product a 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.079
 dairy product a fruit and a drink 

00:01:08.459 --> 00:01:11.759
 for example there is obviously the 

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:14.999
 lunch that you can make vegetables 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:17.099
 starchy foods of meat or fish and 

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:19.439
 especially always water at will 

00:01:17.099 --> 00:01:21.509
 it is the drink at table and for 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.829
 finish the dinner that can be 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.479
 similar to lunch 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:26.490
 if you ever get a little hungry in the after 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.679
 noon you can taste while staying 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.139
 measured of course ah yes last point 

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:33.090
 take the time to eat to chew 

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:34.200
 that's also important especially for the 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.270
 digestion 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.860
 yes in life there are those for whom 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.850
 cook and is a passion and those 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.369
 for whom it is a chore 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.710
 yet with some good reflexes 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.890
 can cook quickly and healthily 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.460
 economically for example consuming 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.679
 seasonal products 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.549
 it costs less and respects the 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:52.409
 rhythm of nature 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.000
 think about preserves and products 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.759
 frozen their nutritional qualities 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.560
 are close to fresh produce for that 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.179
 to cook from Vienna to pleasure 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.119
 not to vary the shapes and the recipes 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:04.520
 gratin pie in mashed potatoes or 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.740
 compote 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.660

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.910
 have to eat everything everyday in 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.709
 reasonable amount of everything are 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.239
 of course the fruits the vegetables the 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.829
 dairy products meat fish 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.840
 starchy eggs 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:20.370
 but we must also limit the 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.290
 fat sweet products and salt 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.790
 as for water and sport it's up to 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.790
