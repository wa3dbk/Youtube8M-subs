tonight<00:00:06.450> I<00:00:06.480> mean<00:00:06.839> the<00:00:07.020> thing<00:00:07.200> is<00:00:07.319> is<00:00:07.470> this<00:00:07.589> is

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
tonight I mean the thing is is this is

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.440 
tonight I mean the thing is is this is
all<00:00:07.890> gonna<00:00:08.069> lead<00:00:08.460> into<00:00:08.849> the<00:00:08.940> morning<00:00:09.240> commute

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
all gonna lead into the morning commute

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:10.910 
all gonna lead into the morning commute
and<00:00:09.599> it's<00:00:09.750> gonna<00:00:09.840> tail<00:00:10.200> off<00:00:10.469> during<00:00:10.740> the

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
and it's gonna tail off during the

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.410 
and it's gonna tail off during the
commute<00:00:11.309> so<00:00:11.550> I<00:00:11.580> think<00:00:11.700> that<00:00:11.940> that's<00:00:12.090> good<00:00:12.300> to

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
commute so I think that that's good to

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.570 
commute so I think that that's good to
get<00:00:12.509> a<00:00:12.840> chance<00:00:13.139> for<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:13.799> crews<00:00:14.040> to<00:00:14.219> jump<00:00:14.460> on

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
get a chance for the crews to jump on

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:15.980 
get a chance for the crews to jump on
top<00:00:14.730> of<00:00:14.790> it<00:00:15.030> later<00:00:15.210> tonight<00:00:15.570> and<00:00:15.660> treat<00:00:15.870> the

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
top of it later tonight and treat the

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.840 
top of it later tonight and treat the
roads<00:00:16.170> outside<00:00:16.770> we<00:00:16.890> go<00:00:17.010> right<00:00:17.190> now<00:00:17.220> we<00:00:17.430> have

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
dry conditions but I mean you can even

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.040 
dry conditions but I mean you can even

this one falls into that category this

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:54.860 
this one falls into that category this
instead<00:00:53.940> of<00:00:54.000> your<00:00:54.149> amounts<00:00:54.480> of<00:00:54.570> snow<00:00:54.780> are

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870

go into this Friday and Saturday threat

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.310 
go into this Friday and Saturday threat
I<00:01:00.000> think<00:01:00.120> you're<00:01:00.510> probably<00:01:00.690> gonna<00:01:00.899> be<00:01:01.050> able<00:01:01.199> to

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.410 
I think you're probably gonna be able to
take<00:01:01.559> this<00:01:01.739> band<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.309> put<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.820> little<00:01:03.090> farther

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
take this band and put a little farther

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.479 
take this band and put a little farther
to<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.750> north<00:01:04.110> that<00:01:04.530> snow<00:01:04.860> is<00:01:05.010> looking<00:01:05.309> more

to the north that snow is looking more

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.340

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
hours a little more bark than bite with

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.399 
hours a little more bark than bite with
radar<00:01:27.030> right<00:01:27.210> now<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.869> then<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:27.990> stray<00:01:28.380> flurry

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
radar right now and then a stray flurry

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.200 
radar right now and then a stray flurry
the<00:01:29.130> bulk<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.430> this<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:29.670> not<00:01:29.820> reaching<00:01:29.880> the

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
the bulk of this is not reaching the

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.130 
the bulk of this is not reaching the
ground<00:01:30.329> even<00:01:30.540> where<00:01:30.720> it<00:01:30.780> looks<00:01:30.900> like<00:01:30.960> it's

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
ground even where it looks like it's

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.929 
ground even where it looks like it's
heavier<00:01:31.470> in<00:01:31.680> Philly<00:01:31.950> they're<00:01:32.430> not<00:01:32.670> reporting

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
heavier in Philly they're not reporting

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.730 
heavier in Philly they're not reporting
snowfall<00:01:33.479> yet<00:01:33.659> but<00:01:33.840> just<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.350> south<00:01:34.560> and

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
snowfall yet but just to the south and

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.620 
snowfall yet but just to the south and
west<00:01:34.920> here<00:01:35.400> I<00:01:35.579> think<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.060> snow<00:01:36.270> is<00:01:36.450> starting

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
west here I think the snow is starting

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.600 
west here I think the snow is starting
to<00:01:36.810> fall<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.500> will<00:01:37.920> continue<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.430> spread

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
to fall and will continue to spread

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.999 
to fall and will continue to spread
northward<00:01:39.030> so<00:01:39.329> it'll<00:01:39.479> be<00:01:39.630> snow<00:01:40.290> showers<00:01:40.799> and

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
northward so it'll be snow showers and

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.800 
northward so it'll be snow showers and
kind<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.280> setting<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.820> table<00:01:42.030> moistening

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
kind of setting the table moistening

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.240 
kind of setting the table moistening
things<00:01:43.049> up<00:01:43.229> during<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.680> evening<00:01:43.979> hours<00:01:44.070> and

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
things up during the evening hours and

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.069 
things up during the evening hours and
then<00:01:44.759> we'll<00:01:44.880> get<00:01:45.000> into<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.360> steadier<00:01:45.720> period

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
then we'll get into the steadier period

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.649 
then we'll get into the steadier period
of<00:01:46.140> snow<00:01:46.259> later<00:01:46.619> if<00:01:47.579> you<00:01:47.759> watch<00:01:48.060> this<00:01:48.360> loop

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
of snow later if you watch this loop

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.660 
of snow later if you watch this loop
though<00:01:48.899> not<00:01:49.530> only<00:01:49.860> is<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:50.009> moving<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.549> the

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
though not only is it moving to the

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.700 
though not only is it moving to the
north<00:01:50.909> but<00:01:51.270> it's<00:01:51.420> sort<00:01:51.540> of<00:01:51.600> sliding<00:01:52.320> eastward

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
north but it's sort of sliding eastward

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.740 
north but it's sort of sliding eastward
as<00:01:52.950> well<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.460> that's<00:01:53.820> really<00:01:54.180> gonna<00:01:54.329> put<00:01:54.630> the

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
as well and that's really gonna put the

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.749 
as well and that's really gonna put the
steadier<00:01:55.079> snow<00:01:55.170> just<00:01:55.829> off<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.250> south<00:01:56.520> and

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
steadier snow just off to the south and

patchy snow that will be steady at times

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.200 
patchy snow that will be steady at times
we'll<00:02:01.530> get<00:02:01.740> north<00:02:02.100> of<00:02:02.310> i-80<00:02:02.759> but<00:02:03.060> you'll

we'll get north of i-80 but you'll

some heavier pockets down to the south
and<00:02:24.210> one<00:02:24.600> thing<00:02:24.840> you<00:02:24.960> notice<00:02:25.170> here<00:02:25.560> and<00:02:25.650> this

and one thing you notice here and this

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.260 
and one thing you notice here and this
may<00:02:25.860> be<00:02:25.920> a<00:02:26.040> little<00:02:26.370> quick<00:02:26.700> on<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:26.970> part<00:02:27.150> of<00:02:27.210> the

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
may be a little quick on the part of the

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.420 
may be a little quick on the part of the
Futurecast<00:02:27.600> but<00:02:28.020> between<00:02:28.500> five<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:28.920> seven<00:02:29.250> in

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
Futurecast but between five and seven in

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.840 
Futurecast but between five and seven in
the<00:02:29.490> morning

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
the morning

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.490 
the morning
now<00:02:30.240> the<00:02:30.300> brunt<00:02:30.690> of<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:30.870> storm<00:02:30.900> is<00:02:31.290> starting

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
now the brunt of the storm is starting

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.590 
now the brunt of the storm is starting
to<00:02:31.830> move<00:02:31.980> eastward<00:02:32.460> and<00:02:32.700> as<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.150> commute<00:02:33.450> wear

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
to move eastward and as the commute wear

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.780 
to move eastward and as the commute wear
is<00:02:33.720> on<00:02:33.870> conditions<00:02:34.740> are<00:02:34.860> actually<00:02:34.980> improving

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
is on conditions are actually improving

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.670 
is on conditions are actually improving
so<00:02:35.970> a<00:02:36.000> lot<00:02:36.240> of<00:02:36.270> the<00:02:36.420> accumulation<00:02:36.900> is<00:02:37.200> going<00:02:37.620> to

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
so a lot of the accumulation is going to

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.920 
so a lot of the accumulation is going to
happen<00:02:38.160> before<00:02:38.760> sunrise<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:39.540> then<00:02:39.720> there's

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
happen before sunrise and then there's

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.660 
happen before sunrise and then there's
just<00:02:40.110> snow<00:02:40.200> showers<00:02:40.710> tapering<00:02:41.070> to<00:02:41.220> flurries

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
just snow showers tapering to flurries

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.630 
just snow showers tapering to flurries
after<00:02:42.420> that<00:02:42.570> in<00:02:43.500> terms<00:02:43.710> of<00:02:43.860> snowfall<00:02:44.010> amounts

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
after that in terms of snowfall amounts

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.180 
after that in terms of snowfall amounts
about<00:02:45.300> a<00:02:45.330> half<00:02:45.600> inch<00:02:45.840> to<00:02:46.440> two<00:02:46.710> inches<00:02:47.040> and<00:02:47.160> I

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
about a half inch to two inches and I

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.080 
about a half inch to two inches and I
think<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.400> bulk<00:02:47.580> of<00:02:47.640> the<00:02:47.730> area<00:02:47.850> is<00:02:47.970> between

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
think the bulk of the area is between

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.640
