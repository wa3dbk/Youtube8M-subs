00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:07.399
 Yes, hello today. 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:10.580
 I 'm thinking of requesting before . 

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:14.990
 Ask me to give you some tips on downstrokes. 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:18.680
 Today is a simple double stroke once and for all I know 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:23.630
 I'll also be giving time to have a short description 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:28.550
 Once you have a lot of strokes in the stroke 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:31.519
 I need to know the relationship between the beat and the beat that breaks in that beat . 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:36.550
 Express Eunpyeong 56 minutes * deungdeungdeung 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:36.550
 Even if you try, a word is now 4 minutes operator jump 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:51.580
 You can have my dog's strokes as big as four. 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.580
 I'm going to split it by half and have an eighth note. 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:01.359
 w 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:04.629
 In this way, your idioms say things like callis, shuffles, etc. 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:08.409
 There are various ways to play 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:11.170
 And when once this side now have more copies thereof quarter quadruple 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:14.830
 In a song, double stroke 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:18.659
 Now I see it splitting it thinner 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.659
 For example , 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.060
 222 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:37.350
 That's how it works. 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:42.270
 There are double strokes like this. 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:47.189
 It's free, but if I give you one tip, 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:51.090
 It can be a dirty skill that will reverse the very good atmosphere that effect 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:54.929
 But when you write it wrong , 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:58.740
 It is rather that they do not make a mess 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:02:03.270
 Yes . It is one of the skills that you can listen to. 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.979
 Hasyeotgo I've used this in mind hasyeoseo fast as the slow songs, no matter 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.420
 Highlights of you 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:12.780
 In other words, when you give an accent, 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:16.850
 If you use it, you can show more dramatic effect 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.850
 For example, I try to spend only Korea 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.159
 Oh 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:35.739

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.280
 tote 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:26.270
 It's often used only in highlights. 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:28.130

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:32.590
