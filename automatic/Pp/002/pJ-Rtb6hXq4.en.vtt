are<00:01:48.030> gold-plated<00:01:48.390> these<00:01:48.899> are<00:01:48.990> going<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.170> go

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
are gold-plated these are going to go

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.440 
are gold-plated these are going to go
directly<00:01:49.590> into<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:50.250> headphones<00:01:50.640> as<00:01:50.850> so<00:01:51.299> i'll

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
directly into the headphones as so i'll

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.660 
directly into the headphones as so i'll
go<00:01:51.570> ahead<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.750> demonstrate<00:01:51.960> that<00:01:52.520> you<00:01:53.520> just

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
go ahead and demonstrate that you just

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.580 
go ahead and demonstrate that you just
plug<00:01:53.850> that<00:01:53.880> in<00:01:54.210> right<00:01:54.450> there<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:55.259> you<00:01:55.320> plug

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
plug that in right there and you plug

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.310 
plug that in right there and you plug
this<00:01:55.890> one<00:01:55.950> in<00:01:56.159> right<00:01:57.000> there<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.570> then<00:01:58.170> they're

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
this one in right there and then they're

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.109 
this one in right there and then they're
good<00:01:58.469> to<00:01:58.590> go<00:01:58.619> right<00:01:58.890> there<00:01:59.100> so<00:01:59.700> that's<00:01:59.820> how<00:02:00.060> you

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
good to go right there so that's how you

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.539 
good to go right there so that's how you
connect<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.719> wire<00:02:01.469> to<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.710> headphones<00:02:01.920> and

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
connect the wire to the headphones and

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:03.709 
connect the wire to the headphones and
then<00:02:02.759> moving<00:02:02.909> down<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.210> wire<00:02:03.360> you<00:02:03.479> can<00:02:03.509> see

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
then moving down the wire you can see

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.530 
then moving down the wire you can see
that<00:02:03.840> we<00:02:03.930> have<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:04.350> little<00:02:05.040> our<00:02:06.030> microphone

what's really cool about these

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.620 
what's really cool about these
headphones<00:03:53.460> is<00:03:53.760> the<00:03:53.790> fact<00:03:54.060> that<00:03:54.150> the<00:03:54.330> actual

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
headphones is the fact that the actual

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.600 
headphones is the fact that the actual
headphone<00:03:55.050> engines<00:03:55.440> can<00:03:55.710> come<00:03:55.950> right<00:03:55.980> off<00:03:56.250> the

headphone engines can come right off the
headband<00:03:56.940> right<00:03:57.150> there<00:03:57.300> so<00:03:57.480> you<00:03:57.540> can<00:03:57.660> see<00:03:58.130> they

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
headband right there so you can see they

headband right there so you can see they
come<00:03:59.340> off<00:03:59.550> and<00:03:59.790> that's<00:04:00.210> why<00:04:00.330> I<00:04:00.360> said<00:04:00.600> the

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
come off and that's why I said the

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.630 
come off and that's why I said the
headband<00:04:01.170> is<00:04:01.320> swappable<00:04:01.770> because<00:04:02.370> you<00:04:02.520> can

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
headband is swappable because you can

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.640

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
comfortable leather out to say it felt

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:16.760 
comfortable leather out to say it felt
it<00:04:15.570> feels<00:04:15.780> good<00:04:15.960> when<00:04:16.170> you<00:04:16.320> have<00:04:16.350> them<00:04:16.620> on<00:04:16.739> your

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:16.770 
it feels good when you have them on your

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:17.819 
it feels good when you have them on your

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
head it's not going to feel

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:20.610 
head it's not going to feel
or<00:04:18.220> anything<00:04:18.459> like<00:04:18.579> that<00:04:18.729> um<00:04:19.449> so<00:04:20.079> let's<00:04:20.439> take<00:04:20.560> a

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
or anything like that um so let's take a

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.140 
or anything like that um so let's take a
closer<00:04:20.829> look<00:04:20.919> at<00:04:21.159> the<00:04:21.280> engines<00:04:21.729> they<00:04:21.939> are<00:04:22.120> a

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
closer look at the engines they are a

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.939 
closer look at the engines they are a
glossy<00:04:22.479> finish<00:04:22.659> on<00:04:22.990> the<00:04:23.080> outside<00:04:23.110> this<00:04:23.620> is<00:04:23.680> is

00:04:23.939 --> 00:04:23.949 
glossy finish on the outside this is is

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:26.369 
glossy finish on the outside this is is
good<00:04:24.490> but<00:04:24.729> because<00:04:25.090> it<00:04:25.210> looks<00:04:25.360> awesome<00:04:25.810> but<00:04:25.990> it

00:04:26.369 --> 00:04:26.379 
good but because it looks awesome but it

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:27.689 
good but because it looks awesome but it
is<00:04:26.469> bad<00:04:26.620> because<00:04:26.830> as<00:04:27.129> you<00:04:27.250> can<00:04:27.280> see<00:04:27.400> it

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:27.699 
is bad because as you can see it

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:30.179 
is bad because as you can see it
collects<00:04:28.000> a<00:04:28.150> lot<00:04:28.180> of<00:04:28.629> fingerprints<00:04:29.409> so<00:04:29.979> this

00:04:30.179 --> 00:04:30.189 
collects a lot of fingerprints so this

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:31.679 
collects a lot of fingerprints so this
is<00:04:30.250> going<00:04:30.340> to<00:04:30.400> be<00:04:30.520> a<00:04:30.550> huge<00:04:30.849> fingerprint<00:04:31.509> magnet

00:04:31.679 --> 00:04:31.689 
is going to be a huge fingerprint magnet

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:34.260 
is going to be a huge fingerprint magnet

the little engines on these but they do

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.209 
the little engines on these but they do

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:40.389 
opinion it feels very comfortable and

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:42.119 
opinion it feels very comfortable and
very<00:04:40.599> soft<00:04:40.930> on<00:04:41.139> your<00:04:41.259> ears<00:04:41.530> it's<00:04:41.770> not<00:04:41.919> going<00:04:42.039> to

00:04:42.119 --> 00:04:42.129 
very soft on your ears it's not going to

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:43.379 
very soft on your ears it's not going to
make<00:04:42.219> them<00:04:42.370> hurt<00:04:42.580> too<00:04:42.759> much<00:04:42.909> or<00:04:43.090> anything<00:04:43.360> like

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:43.389 
make them hurt too much or anything like

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:45.719 
make them hurt too much or anything like
that<00:04:43.539> and<00:04:44.199> I<00:04:44.319> think<00:04:44.530> that<00:04:44.770> they<00:04:45.009> are<00:04:45.039> it<00:04:45.580> is

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:45.729 
that and I think that they are it is

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:47.219 
that and I think that they are it is
very<00:04:45.939> nice<00:04:46.150> leather<00:04:46.419> and<00:04:46.629> I<00:04:46.659> definitely<00:04:46.960> like

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:47.229 
very nice leather and I definitely like

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:49.980 
very nice leather and I definitely like
it<00:04:47.259> does<00:04:47.919> come<00:04:48.129> from<00:04:48.219> one<00:04:48.400> you<00:04:48.520> have<00:04:48.669> on<00:04:49.030> now<00:04:49.300> on

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
it does come from one you have on now on

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.869 
it does come from one you have on now on
the<00:04:50.440> reason<00:04:50.710> that<00:04:50.860> they<00:04:50.979> the<00:04:51.250> wire<00:04:51.490> is

00:04:51.869 --> 00:04:51.879 
the reason that they the wire is

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:53.339 
the reason that they the wire is
actually<00:04:52.180> connecting<00:04:52.509> to<00:04:52.599> both<00:04:52.750> earphones<00:04:53.169> is

00:04:53.339 --> 00:04:53.349 
actually connecting to both earphones is

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:54.809 
actually connecting to both earphones is
because<00:04:53.710> it's<00:04:53.860> not<00:04:54.009> actually<00:04:54.370> connected<00:04:54.759> to

00:04:54.809 --> 00:04:54.819 
because it's not actually connected to

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:56.580 
because it's not actually connected to
this<00:04:54.940> headband<00:04:55.389> so<00:04:55.960> you<00:04:56.020> are<00:04:56.110> gonna<00:04:56.349> have<00:04:56.469> to

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
this headband so you are gonna have to

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.469 
this headband so you are gonna have to
have<00:04:56.680> two<00:04:56.889> inputs<00:04:57.099> personally<00:04:57.789> I<00:04:57.909> like<00:04:58.240> the

00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479 
have two inputs personally I like the

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:01.589 
have two inputs personally I like the
wire<00:04:59.440> coming<00:04:59.740> only<00:04:59.919> out<00:05:00.190> of<00:05:00.310> one<00:05:00.520> ear<00:05:00.819> like<00:05:01.419> on

00:05:01.589 --> 00:05:01.599 
wire coming only out of one ear like on

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:03.959 
wire coming only out of one ear like on
the<00:05:02.259> beats<00:05:02.440> by<00:05:02.590> dre<00:05:02.830> and<00:05:02.979> stuff<00:05:03.159> like<00:05:03.280> that<00:05:03.340> but

00:05:03.959 --> 00:05:03.969 
the beats by dre and stuff like that but

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:05.879 
the beats by dre and stuff like that but
um<00:05:04.270> the<00:05:04.629> wire<00:05:04.810> doesn't<00:05:05.080> get<00:05:05.319> too<00:05:05.500> much<00:05:05.650> in<00:05:05.800> the

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:05.889 
um the wire doesn't get too much in the

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:07.020 
um the wire doesn't get too much in the
way<00:05:05.919> when<00:05:06.159> you<00:05:06.280> listen<00:05:06.550> to<00:05:06.580> these<00:05:06.759> headphones

headphones come like this because I

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.659 
headphones come like this because I

thought that it would put a lot of

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:47.579 
thought that it would put a lot of
pressure<00:05:45.969> in<00:05:46.150> your<00:05:46.180> head<00:05:46.419> but<00:05:47.110> it<00:05:47.409> actually

pressure in your head but it actually

00:05:47.589 --> 00:05:49.740
