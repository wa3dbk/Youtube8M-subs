00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:12.890
 I like I hope that but well the same 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:17.150
 electro gave this video 

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:21.510
 to double children like two fingers and good 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:24.000
 They are very comfortable and 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.100
 and we can do it in our cases and the 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.020
 true that it is very fashionable and it comes out very 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.570
 expensive has been seeing the company with 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.850
 head for a warning 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.410
 it's kind of stupid, that's good but 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.760
 see how the house is located mind and 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.890
 man 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.140
 easy so good stay in this 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.469
 video to see how they are made and we go with 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.129
 the materials to make these rings 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:46.050
 We are mainly going to make a 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.750
 ornament for our rings can be 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.640
 both cloth 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:54.470
 an ornament that may have old or what 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.120
 can buy in haberdasheries that are 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.130
 super cheap and they have so many 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.250
 models the second we scream is a 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:03.080
 key ring or two rings of these 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.670
 which are more serious are very 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.440
 easy to get but good to use a 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.869
 hinge because it appeared much easier 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.400
 get it in my house and in third and 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.560
 last place told them that they are going to remove 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.150
 glue you use the droplet people 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.619
 pretty good I'm going with that but good 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.479
 if you have a strong glue in 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.670
 their houses for a boy also and for 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.710
 give a little more wave to the ring what 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.259
 What I did was paint it with black enamel 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.000
 and I used some glitter to the last 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:27.530
 I find as I said it well fingers 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.729
 all the materials now let's see 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.729
 how these rings are made 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.790
 as you see here I have several ornaments for 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.140
 choosing has fabric how important it is 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.570
 that we're not going to hit it obviously 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.270
 that we are going to choose it with thread and needle 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.620
 it's a step surely I'm going to choose this 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.020
 adornment so good I'll have the 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.120
 ring of knowing these two things and what 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.190
 we are going to set aside the case 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.500
 I use rings instead of the ring 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.210
 know or grabbing services and in case of 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.000
 that are ground rings what I have 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.250
 what to do is open it as here has the 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.930
 fold this man looks good 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.200
 contrary under the back 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.330
 is to open it until there are two circles 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.820
 you can do it with a 100 clamp very 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.710
 hard this material or can you say it 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.360
 someone to help them see how 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:18.420
 we are going to open and they are doing 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.420
 like two circuits there is 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.769
 is to measure type very large subjects or very 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.800
 little ones for our fingers we are going to 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:29.020
 measure it that I plan to put it here 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.660
 how do you see very big where 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:35.580
 cause is to adjust it with this 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.580
 it had always cost squeezing 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.860
 we are going to take it out and we will go squeezing 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.819
 in this way and that way we're going to 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.819
 go adjusting 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.420
 as this is something that you with the 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.400
 I made a pizza because it cost me a lot 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.710
 quite carry this material but they have 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.090
 have to make sure it's enough 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:56.380
 I adjust your fingers or put a 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.380
 little bit of glue 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.560
 what would be all the milestone fold 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:08.609
 we support you 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.980
 and now what we do is wait for the 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:12.900
 glue a little bit ten minutes we have 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.849
 been dry and there we will see another 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.469
 ring made remember that the glue 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:17.790
 I said quite strong because this one 

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:19.650
 is going to make it not go away at all 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.569
 be careful with the glue because 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.549
 hits a lot obviously because the 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:29.829
 glue 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:32.230
 and is that we have two double facts is 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:34.889
 decorate it or paint it with enamel to 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.889
 black nails 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.519
 well as ben alÃ­ I painted everything with 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.930
 black enamel 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:43.360
 use a little glitter 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.909
 glue to decorate some areas 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.659
 as the antennas as before and good 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:48.659
 good 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:56.090
 horizontina above 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.330
 it is lovely liked are super easy to 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.330
 do 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.300
 42 and guys I hope you have 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.830
 understood and that the those authors because of 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.450

 how did you choose so that all 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.860
 the passions our services and let's see 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.780
 if we are all rigorous because 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.090
 we have at least three years at least 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.560
 of 250 and good as had been said in 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.780
 facebook that despite with videos of 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.850
 recycling and this is like the first 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.710
 let's say we can use things from 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.500
 our cases or for less than two pesos 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:31.180
 towards two very cute 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.710

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.450
 bloopers for the two thousand subscribers and 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.860
 I could not post the many sides because 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.960

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:35.439
 that leads them to say 

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:35.439

 through the chain 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.360

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.900
