00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
together will maximize our life our

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.119 
together will maximize our life our
light<00:00:53.579> area<00:00:54.379> once<00:00:55.379> we<00:00:55.500> get<00:00:55.620> all<00:00:55.739> four<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.010> these

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
light area once we get all four of these

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.860 
light area once we get all four of these
fixtures<00:00:56.910> hung<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.949> we'll<00:00:58.949> go<00:00:59.070> from<00:00:59.160> there<00:00:59.309> so

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
fixtures hung and we'll go from there so

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.569 
fixtures hung and we'll go from there so
these<00:01:00.870> are<00:01:01.050> bulkhead<00:01:01.469> adaptors<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:01.920> I'll

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
these are bulkhead adaptors and I'll

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.219 
these are bulkhead adaptors and I'll
talk<00:01:02.699> about<00:01:02.730> those<00:01:02.969> in<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.210> second<00:01:03.539> I<00:01:03.660> just<00:01:04.080> want

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.080 
talk about those in a second I just want
to<00:01:04.320> say<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.470> guys<00:01:04.559> these<00:01:04.739> grow<00:01:04.920> beds<00:01:05.100> are

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
to say you guys these grow beds are

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.000 
to say you guys these grow beds are
these<00:01:06.299> containers<00:01:06.780> what<00:01:07.140> we<00:01:07.200> did<00:01:07.350> they<00:01:07.799> were

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
these containers what we did they were

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.530 
these containers what we did they were
there<00:01:08.220> initially<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.610> transparent<00:01:09.360> container

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
there initially a transparent container

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.690 
there initially a transparent container
but<00:01:10.470> we<00:01:10.530> painted<00:01:10.770> them<00:01:10.830> on<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.040> outside<00:01:11.400> to

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
but we painted them on the outside to

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.850 
but we painted them on the outside to
minimize<00:01:12.060> algae<00:01:12.390> growth<00:01:12.600> so<00:01:13.500> we<00:01:13.560> don't<00:01:13.710> want

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
minimize algae growth so we don't want

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.480 
minimize algae growth so we don't want
Howze<00:01:14.130> robbing<00:01:14.490> our<00:01:14.580> system<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:14.939> any<00:01:15.060> nutrient

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.920 
running into the tank a lot so in order
to<00:01:29.210> put<00:01:30.210> that<00:01:30.329> I'm<00:01:30.420> gonna<00:01:30.509> go<00:01:30.630> ahead<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:30.780> buy

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
to put that I'm gonna go ahead and buy

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.289 
to put that I'm gonna go ahead and buy
some<00:01:31.170> large<00:01:31.590> PVC<00:01:32.430> fittings<00:01:32.909> or<00:01:33.060> something

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
themselves so put this back down pH

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.340 
themselves so put this back down pH
testing<00:01:42.030> kit<00:01:42.210> I<00:01:42.360> did<00:01:42.689> this<00:01:42.780> just<00:01:43.140> did<00:01:43.259> the

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
testing kit I did this just did the

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.139 
testing kit I did this just did the

water last night just to give it a

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.219 
water last night just to give it a
little<00:01:45.299> test<00:01:45.540> cuz<00:01:45.780> I've<00:01:45.869> never<00:01:46.020> done<00:01:46.170> it

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
little test cuz I've never done it

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.149 
little test cuz I've never done it
before<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.670> our<00:01:47.670> pH<00:01:48.000> is<00:01:48.530> on<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.680> high<00:01:49.829> it's

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
before and our pH is on the high it's

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.289 
before and our pH is on the high it's
about<00:01:50.220> seven<00:01:50.670> point<00:01:50.880> six

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299 
about seven point six

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:53.880 
about seven point six
our<00:01:52.479> ammonia<00:01:52.930> is<00:01:53.079> still<00:01:53.289> zero<00:01:53.560> parts<00:01:53.829> per

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
our ammonia is still zero parts per

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.649 
our ammonia is still zero parts per
million<00:01:54.130> so<00:01:54.850> that's<00:01:55.030> good

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
million so that's good

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:57.330 
million so that's good
aerator<00:01:56.200> still<00:01:56.439> running<00:01:56.679> good<00:01:56.799> that's<00:01:57.280> the

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
aerator still running good that's the

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.919 
aerator still running good that's the
fish<00:01:57.490> food<00:01:57.700> we're<00:01:57.880> using<00:01:58.000> it's<00:01:58.570> just<00:01:58.630> what<00:01:58.840> we

Vulcan adaptors they're pretty they're a
little<00:02:30.910> pricey<00:02:31.120> online<00:02:31.930> but<00:02:32.500> we<00:02:32.590> got<00:02:32.709> I<00:02:32.950> think

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
little pricey online but we got I think

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.839 
little pricey online but we got I think
10<00:02:33.700> of<00:02:33.819> them<00:02:34.079> in<00:02:35.079> case<00:02:36.010> you<00:02:36.099> needed<00:02:36.610> any<00:02:36.819> extra

but it'll hit something like that a hose

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.930 
but it'll hit something like that a hose
will<00:02:39.819> come<00:02:39.970> down<00:02:40.319> through<00:02:41.319> the<00:02:41.470> bottom<00:02:41.739> and

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.720 
the height of the bell siphon will you
know<00:02:50.230> that's<00:02:51.069> how<00:02:51.190> we'll<00:02:51.340> play<00:02:51.459> with<00:02:51.579> our

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
know that's how we'll play with our

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.270 
know that's how we'll play with our
water<00:02:51.849> levels<00:02:52.209> but<00:02:52.840> those<00:02:53.230> will<00:02:53.410> run<00:02:53.560> up<00:02:53.739> to

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
water levels but those will run up to

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.729 
water levels but those will run up to
the<00:02:54.670> bell<00:02:54.819> siphon<00:02:55.000> you'll<00:02:55.720> fill<00:02:55.959> up<00:02:55.989> and<00:02:56.319> that

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
the bell siphon you'll fill up and that

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:58.559 
the bell siphon you'll fill up and that
will<00:02:56.920> select<00:02:57.130> turn<00:02:57.700> back<00:02:57.910> and<00:02:58.060> do<00:02:58.120> some<00:02:58.359> tank

will select turn back and do some tank

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.509 
will select turn back and do some tank
which<00:02:58.840> is<00:02:58.870> right<00:02:59.109> here<00:02:59.139> and<00:02:59.769> from<00:03:00.220> the<00:03:00.310> sump

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
which is right here and from the sump

which is right here and from the sump
tank<00:03:01.079> back<00:03:02.079> to<00:03:02.350> the<00:03:02.440> Grove<00:03:03.269> the<00:03:04.269> line<00:03:04.450> will

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
tank back to the Grove the line will

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.660 
tank back to the Grove the line will
come<00:03:04.840> out<00:03:04.989> it's<00:03:05.859> going<00:03:05.950> to<00:03:06.010> be<00:03:06.130> really<00:03:06.400> neat

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
come out it's going to be really neat

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.190 
come out it's going to be really neat
and<00:03:06.790> clean<00:03:06.940> so<00:03:07.299> it'll<00:03:07.510> come<00:03:07.630> out<00:03:07.750> you<00:03:08.109> know

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
and clean so it'll come out you know

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.330 
and clean so it'll come out you know
about<00:03:08.500> the<00:03:08.590> center<00:03:08.889> a<00:03:09.280> hose<00:03:09.970> will<00:03:10.120> run<00:03:10.269> down

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
about the center a hose will run down

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.849 
about the center a hose will run down
across<00:03:12.340> this<00:03:12.549> here<00:03:13.319> and<00:03:14.319> we'll<00:03:14.440> just<00:03:14.470> split<00:03:14.709> it

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:14.859 
across this here and we'll just split it

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:16.379 
across this here and we'll just split it
up<00:03:14.920> into<00:03:15.069> a<00:03:15.160> four<00:03:15.430> way<00:03:15.579> section<00:03:16.000> where<00:03:16.180> you

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:16.389 
up into a four way section where you

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:19.289 
up into a four way section where you
know<00:03:16.739> each<00:03:17.739> grow<00:03:17.980> bed<00:03:18.160> will<00:03:18.310> be<00:03:18.430> will<00:03:19.209> be

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
know each grow bed will be will be

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:24.120 
know each grow bed will be will be
filled<00:03:21.510> but<00:03:22.510> yeah<00:03:22.630> that's<00:03:23.049> that's<00:03:23.739> what's

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
filled but yeah that's that's what's

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.930 
filled but yeah that's that's what's
going<00:03:24.400> on<00:03:24.489> that<00:03:25.180> our<00:03:25.630> pumps<00:03:26.459> we<00:03:27.459> got<00:03:27.609> a<00:03:27.639> great

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
going on that our pumps we got a great

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.780 
going on that our pumps we got a great
deal<00:03:28.180> on<00:03:28.239> these<00:03:28.540> on<00:03:29.079> this<00:03:29.319> pump<00:03:29.889> with<00:03:30.519> a<00:03:30.549> float

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
deal on these on this pump with a float

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.400 
deal on these on this pump with a float
I<00:03:31.030> think<00:03:31.540> this<00:03:31.630> is<00:03:31.780> something<00:03:31.930> like<00:03:32.079> forty

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
I think this is something like forty

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:33.930 
I think this is something like forty
bucks<00:03:32.590> and<00:03:32.829> thirty<00:03:33.220> four<00:03:33.430> hundred<00:03:33.459> gallons

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
bucks and thirty four hundred gallons

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.990 
bucks and thirty four hundred gallons
per<00:03:34.030> hour<00:03:34.410> pump<00:03:35.410> and<00:03:35.889> that<00:03:36.190> will<00:03:36.310> go<00:03:36.819> in<00:03:36.880> or

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
per hour pump and that will go in or

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.420 
per hour pump and that will go in or
some<00:03:37.180> tank<00:03:37.419> and<00:03:38.079> then<00:03:38.440> because<00:03:39.190> of<00:03:39.220> the<00:03:39.340> way

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
some tank and then because of the way

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:40.589 
some tank and then because of the way
our<00:03:39.459> system<00:03:39.669> is<00:03:39.940> set<00:03:40.090> up<00:03:40.150> because<00:03:40.359> of<00:03:40.540> the

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:40.599 
our system is set up because of the

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:41.759 
our system is set up because of the
height<00:03:40.750> of<00:03:40.930> the<00:03:40.989> tank<00:03:41.169> and<00:03:41.349> the<00:03:41.440> height<00:03:41.590> of<00:03:41.620> the

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
height of the tank and the height of the

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:44.009 
height of the tank and the height of the
beds<00:03:42.000> we<00:03:43.000> didn't<00:03:43.299> we're<00:03:43.660> not<00:03:43.780> going<00:03:43.900> to<00:03:43.930> be

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
beds we didn't we're not going to be

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:45.509 
beds we didn't we're not going to be
doing<00:03:44.139> a<00:03:44.319> gravity<00:03:44.680> fed<00:03:44.859> system<00:03:45.069> because<00:03:45.459> you

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
doing a gravity fed system because you

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:46.710 
doing a gravity fed system because you
don't<00:03:45.669> want<00:03:45.790> to<00:03:45.849> put<00:03:45.940> any<00:03:46.090> more<00:03:46.120> holes<00:03:46.389> in<00:03:46.599> or

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
don't want to put any more holes in or

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.930 
don't want to put any more holes in or
into<00:03:47.139> our<00:03:47.169> fish<00:03:47.410> tank<00:03:47.530> Julia<00:03:48.459> sighs<00:03:48.609> screw<00:03:48.880> it

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
we might be looking at a different pump

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.449 
we might be looking at a different pump
but<00:04:04.030> and<00:04:04.299> I'm<00:04:05.019> sorry<00:04:05.260> I'm<00:04:05.409> I'm<00:04:06.069> sure<00:04:06.280> this'll

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
but and I'm sorry I'm I'm sure this'll

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:07.860 
but and I'm sorry I'm I'm sure this'll
be<00:04:06.609> arrived<00:04:06.819> but<00:04:06.969> 1,400<00:04:07.480> gallons<00:04:07.569> per<00:04:07.810> hour

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
be arrived but 1,400 gallons per hour

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.819 
be arrived but 1,400 gallons per hour
will<00:04:08.170> supply<00:04:08.470> the<00:04:08.530> water<00:04:09.459> in<00:04:09.760> and<00:04:10.060> the<00:04:10.829> $3,400

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829 
will supply the water in and the $3,400

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:14.759 
will supply the water in and the $3,400
per<00:04:11.950> hour<00:04:12.040> will<00:04:12.400> take<00:04:12.970> the<00:04:13.090> water<00:04:13.590> back<00:04:14.590> into

per hour will take the water back into

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:17.909 
per hour will take the water back into
the<00:04:14.859> fish<00:04:14.950> tank<00:04:15.069> itself<00:04:15.549> so<00:04:16.650> that's<00:04:17.650> pretty

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
the fish tank itself so that's pretty

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:18.449 
the fish tank itself so that's pretty
much<00:04:18.009> it

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
much it

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.159 
much it
like<00:04:18.820> I<00:04:18.910> said<00:04:19.090> I<00:04:19.120> ran<00:04:19.269> out<00:04:19.419> of<00:04:19.449> them<00:04:19.600> are<00:04:19.810> we<00:04:19.989> ran

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
like I said I ran out of them are we ran

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:23.249 
like I said I ran out of them are we ran
out<00:04:20.259> of<00:04:20.320> money<00:04:21.389> this<00:04:22.389> week<00:04:22.600> so<00:04:22.930> we<00:04:23.050> won't<00:04:23.199> be

00:04:23.249 --> 00:04:23.259 
out of money this week so we won't be

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:29.490 
out of money this week so we won't be
doing<00:04:23.410> any<00:04:24.250> too<00:04:24.849> much<00:04:24.880> more<00:04:27.449> but<00:04:28.449> we<00:04:28.570> might<00:04:29.259> do

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
doing any too much more but we might do

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.560 
doing any too much more but we might do
the<00:04:29.680> the<00:04:30.610> plumbing<00:04:30.940> of<00:04:31.000> the<00:04:31.090> system<00:04:31.360> but<00:04:31.449> I'm

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
the the plumbing of the system but I'm

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.040 
the the plumbing of the system but I'm
not<00:04:31.720> sure<00:04:31.900> yet<00:04:32.050> but<00:04:33.690> as<00:04:34.690> far<00:04:34.870> as<00:04:34.900> like<00:04:34.990> the
