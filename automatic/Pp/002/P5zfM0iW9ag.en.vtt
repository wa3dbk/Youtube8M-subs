00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
your doctor yet so taking another look

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.460 
your doctor yet so taking another look
at<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:25.910> microvasculature<00:02:26.510> we're<00:02:27.080> able<00:02:27.260> to

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
at the microvasculature we're able to

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.440 
at the microvasculature we're able to
