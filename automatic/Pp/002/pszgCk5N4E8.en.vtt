00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:05.400
 hybris today i tell you how i like this 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.710
 just blow up updos 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.410
 I came first 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.450
 Making hair out of a 60 makes me 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.549
 years a braid when you daily 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.670
 simply a vacuum by what 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.350
 is transparent with the second band 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.250
 I'm wrong on the 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.109
 same height now a second braid 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:30.570
 I share the first zoff in two 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:33.030
 halves and the second pot high 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.460
 and just pin it with a pinch 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.610
 above 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:41.460
 This creates a ring from the first Zoff 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.520
 around the second braid this left over 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.829
 remaining hair I find with a 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.590
 little new brain to a third braid 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.530
 together now I admit the second one 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.780
 fall and get this back in two 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.590
 the same parts share a ring 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:05.250
 So create and plait in two equal 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:08.090
 parts divide the third pot on the head 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.090
 stick 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:16.720
 and make a ring around the braid again 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:20.770
 give something to hair and a new 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:24.000
 do a job and be so handy until the 2nd 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.000
 just pull through 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.810
 after being with a second only 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.550
 Once we have arrived , we draw our things 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.440
 strongly apart 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.200
 Often we hide the hair ties 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.800
 surround our updo a lot 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.800
 lost 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.930
 Now we want the remaining hair 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.260
 and hide it under our house 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:52.300
 piece for so and fasten that with the 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:53.900
 hair spa and our first step is 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.000
 finished 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:59.380
 for the second hairstyle two pair us 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.380
 our crown 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.440
 Now we divide our hair in four 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:11.770
 same-sized actions on scope one 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.770
 simple three string braid 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.620
 the front of songs free 12 14 we forward 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.160
 and the back two 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:32.580
 rollvi flat on the back of a head 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:35.340
 circle and hide the ends under the 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:41.250
 plaited plait and attach it with 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:43.470
 the cock on the basis of our 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.470
 updo we now put the 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:49.920
 cross over both front pigtails 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:53.130
 on top of each other and hide the ends and 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.320
 stuck the whole thing with the hague 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.530
 cling or hairpins depending on what 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.530
 you want to 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.770
 I hope this video I liked 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.980
 give me a thumbs up around 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.980
 soon
