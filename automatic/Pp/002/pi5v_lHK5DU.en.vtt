00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.679 
humbucker here's our clean tone now
let's<00:01:03.870> get<00:01:04.019> engage<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.680> effect<00:01:05.040> here<00:01:05.540> we<00:01:06.540> turn

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
let's get engage the effect here we turn

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.899 
let's get engage the effect here we turn
it<00:01:06.840> on<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.229> we're<00:01:07.500> gonna<00:01:07.680> keep<00:01:07.979> our<00:01:08.189> gain<00:01:08.610> up

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
it on and we're gonna keep our gain up

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.969 
it on and we're gonna keep our gain up
our<00:01:09.330> tone<00:01:09.750> control<00:01:10.200> right<00:01:10.409> in<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.590> middle<00:01:10.770> and

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
our tone control right in the middle and

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.010 
our tone control right in the middle and
the<00:01:11.549> clean<00:01:11.820> we're<00:01:11.970> going<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.180> keep<00:01:12.330> down<00:01:12.630> for

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
the clean we're going to keep down for

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.170 
the clean we're going to keep down for
now<00:01:13.200> our<00:01:13.470> output<00:01:14.010> volume<00:01:14.130> will<00:01:14.520> just<00:01:14.700> set<00:01:14.909> you

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
now our output volume will just set you

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:31.600 
now our output volume will just set you
know<00:01:15.299> right<00:01:15.509> about<00:01:15.630> neutral<00:01:16.170> here

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.990 

so<00:01:32.390> pretty<00:01:32.630> great<00:01:32.960> sounding<00:01:33.530> gain<00:01:34.000> or

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
so pretty great sounding gain or

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.300 
so pretty great sounding gain or
overdriving<00:01:35.720> we<00:01:36.560> turn<00:01:36.770> the<00:01:36.890> gain<00:01:37.100> down<00:01:37.250> a

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
overdriving we turn the gain down a

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:46.480 
overdriving we turn the gain down a
little<00:01:37.580> bit<00:01:37.760> here<00:01:44.890> it's<00:01:45.890> got<00:01:46.070> a<00:01:46.100> really<00:01:46.310> nice

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
little bit here it's got a really nice

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.510 
little bit here it's got a really nice
range<00:01:46.820> on<00:01:47.030> it<00:01:47.170> sounds<00:01:48.170> very<00:01:48.410> natural<00:01:48.920> sounds

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
range on it sounds very natural sounds

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.830 
range on it sounds very natural sounds
very<00:01:49.580> much<00:01:49.730> like<00:01:49.790> an<00:01:50.060> over<00:01:50.270> driven<00:01:50.480> amp

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
very much like an over driven amp

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.870 
very much like an over driven amp
okay<00:01:51.530> let's<00:01:51.710> crank<00:01:51.920> the<00:01:52.070> gain<00:01:52.220> again<00:01:52.490> and

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
okay let's crank the gain again and

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.420 
okay let's crank the gain again and
start<00:01:53.630> to<00:01:53.690> bring<00:01:53.810> in<00:01:53.930> the<00:01:53.990> clean<00:01:54.260> tone<00:01:54.500> now<00:01:55.310> as

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
start to bring in the clean tone now as

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.760 
start to bring in the clean tone now as
we<00:01:55.550> bring<00:01:55.790> in<00:01:56.030> clean<00:01:56.330> here<00:01:56.810> actually<00:01:57.650> I'll

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
we bring in clean here actually I'll

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.820 
we bring in clean here actually I'll
play<00:01:57.980> a<00:01:58.010> note<00:01:58.280> while<00:01:59.060> I<00:01:59.090> bring<00:01:59.420> it<00:01:59.510> in<00:02:02.680> you<00:02:03.680> can

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
play a note while I bring it in you can

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.030 
play a note while I bring it in you can
see<00:02:03.979> as<00:02:04.100> you<00:02:04.220> sweep<00:02:04.430> across<00:02:04.700> the<00:02:04.940> frequency

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
see as you sweep across the frequency

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.630 
see as you sweep across the frequency
it's<00:02:07.040> really<00:02:07.460> like<00:02:07.640> a<00:02:07.670> wet<00:02:08.030> dry<00:02:08.420> mix<00:02:09.310> so<00:02:10.310> if<00:02:10.459> we

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
it's really like a wet dry mix so if we

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.780 
it's really like a wet dry mix so if we
have<00:02:10.940> it<00:02:11.660> all<00:02:11.900> the<00:02:11.990> way<00:02:12.080> clean<00:02:12.580> almost<00:02:13.580> got

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
have it all the way clean almost got

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.120 
have it all the way clean almost got
like<00:02:13.850> a<00:02:13.910> clean<00:02:14.300> boost<00:02:14.630> going<00:02:14.930> on<00:02:15.170> if<00:02:15.770> we<00:02:15.980> bring

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
like a clean boost going on if we bring

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.050 
like a clean boost going on if we bring
it<00:02:16.250> right<00:02:16.370> in<00:02:16.490> the<00:02:16.550> middle<00:02:16.850> a<00:02:18.700> really<00:02:19.700> sort<00:02:20.030> of

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
it right in the middle a really sort of

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.440 
it right in the middle a really sort of
unique<00:02:20.390> blend<00:02:20.900> of<00:02:21.280> this<00:02:22.280> excellent<00:02:22.940> sounding

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
unique blend of this excellent sounding

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.780 
unique blend of this excellent sounding
gain<00:02:23.660> structure<00:02:24.170> and<00:02:24.350> your<00:02:25.070> sort<00:02:25.490> of<00:02:25.550> pure

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
gain structure and your sort of pure

00:02:25.790 --> 00:03:02.170 
gain structure and your sort of pure
glean<00:02:26.150> clean<00:02:26.780> tone

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.180 

it<00:03:03.180> also<00:03:03.330> lets<00:03:03.630> this<00:03:03.810> pedal<00:03:04.110> act<00:03:04.350> as<00:03:04.590> a<00:03:04.650> clean

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
it also lets this pedal act as a clean

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:17.540 
it also lets this pedal act as a clean
boost<00:03:05.460> if<00:03:05.670> you<00:03:05.760> need<00:03:15.230> there<00:03:16.230> you<00:03:16.320> go<00:03:16.410> so<00:03:17.370> that
