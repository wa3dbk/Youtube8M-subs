00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
the hard drive up but that's just

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.730 
the hard drive up but that's just
something<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.979> remember<00:01:14.570> so<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:16.170> basically

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
something to remember so I basically

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.810 
something to remember so I basically
just<00:01:16.979> poked<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.549> screwdriver<00:01:18.030> right<00:01:18.900> through

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
just poked the screwdriver right through

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:27.560

tube<00:01:20.820> off<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.360> screw<00:01:21.570> out<00:01:25.670> all<00:01:26.670> right<00:01:26.820> this

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
tube off the screw out all right this

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.109 
tube off the screw out all right this
part<00:01:27.900> is<00:01:28.080> kind<00:01:28.710> of<00:01:28.890> tricky<00:01:29.130> sometimes<00:01:29.729> are

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
part is kind of tricky sometimes are

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.539 
part is kind of tricky sometimes are
easier<00:01:30.450> than<00:01:30.509> others<00:01:30.799> but<00:01:31.799> basically<00:01:32.250> you<00:01:32.400> can

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
easier than others but basically you can

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.270 
easier than others but basically you can
see<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.850> shell<00:01:33.090> has<00:01:33.360> two<00:01:33.570> halves<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.280> you're

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
see the shell has two halves and you're

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.270 
see the shell has two halves and you're
just<00:01:35.430> trying<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:36.689> get<00:01:37.680> these<00:01:37.799> apart<00:01:38.130> without

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
just trying to get these apart without

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.760 
just trying to get these apart without
breaking<00:01:38.729> anything<00:01:39.079> it's<00:01:40.079> me<00:01:40.200> kind<00:01:40.439> of<00:01:40.500> hard

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
breaking anything it's me kind of hard

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.520 
breaking anything it's me kind of hard
because<00:01:41.040> there<00:01:41.460> is<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.670> little<00:01:42.000> bit<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.180> force

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
because there is a little bit of force

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.740 
because there is a little bit of force
and<00:01:43.530> old<00:01:43.829> actually<00:01:44.759> just<00:01:45.030> set<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.420> camera

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
and old actually just set the camera

00:01:45.750 --> 00:02:00.740 
and old actually just set the camera
down<00:01:47.090> so<00:01:48.090> I<00:01:48.149> can

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.820 

all<00:02:01.750> right<00:02:02.160> everything<00:02:03.160> came<00:02:03.370> out<00:02:03.550> clean

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.660 
all right everything came out clean

latch and a screw but if you're like me
you'll<00:02:22.270> probably<00:02:22.300> have<00:02:22.840> it<00:02:22.990> fall<00:02:23.200> off<00:02:23.230> at<00:02:23.710> some

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
you'll probably have it fall off at some

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.850 
you'll probably have it fall off at some
point<00:02:24.390> so<00:02:25.390> you've<00:02:25.570> got<00:02:25.600> to<00:02:25.900> know<00:02:25.960> how<00:02:26.020> to<00:02:26.200> get

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
point so you've got to know how to get

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.250 
point so you've got to know how to get
it<00:02:27.040> back<00:02:27.160> together<00:02:27.400> and<00:02:27.910> the<00:02:28.510> way<00:02:28.630> you<00:02:28.690> do<00:02:29.020> that

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
it back together and the way you do that

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:35.640 
it back together and the way you do that
is<00:02:29.560> you<00:02:30.250> put<00:02:30.850> the<00:02:31.000> spring<00:02:31.720> on<00:02:31.900> here<00:02:32.260> and<00:02:34.650> this

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
is you put the spring on here and this

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.370 
is you put the spring on here and this
is<00:02:35.830> a<00:02:35.860> lot<00:02:36.070> easier<00:02:36.100> if<00:02:36.490> you<00:02:36.580> have<00:02:36.670> two<00:02:36.850> hands

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
is a lot easier if you have two hands

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:43.660 
is a lot easier if you have two hands
sit<00:02:38.380> alongside

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.470 

so<00:02:44.240> you're<00:02:44.390> just<00:02:44.450> going<00:02:44.750> to<00:02:46.120> stick<00:02:47.120> that<00:02:47.300> on

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
so you're just going to stick that on

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.589 
so you're just going to stick that on
that<00:02:47.860> so<00:02:48.860> the<00:02:48.980> spring<00:02:49.250> lines<00:02:49.489> up<00:02:49.730> and<00:02:52.420> going<00:02:53.420> to

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:53.599 
that so the spring lines up and going to

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:55.900 
that so the spring lines up and going to
stick<00:02:54.110> your<00:02:54.260> button<00:02:54.680> right<00:02:55.489> back<00:02:55.670> in<00:02:55.819> the

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
stick your button right back in the

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.910 
stick your button right back in the
notch<00:02:56.590> alright<00:02:57.590> so<00:02:58.160> the<00:02:58.280> next<00:02:58.310> step<00:02:58.700> is<00:02:59.920> pretty

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
notch alright so the next step is pretty

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.110 
notch alright so the next step is pretty
obvious<00:03:01.130> you're<00:03:01.550> going<00:03:01.700> to<00:03:01.760> switch

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
obvious you're going to switch

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.930 
obvious you're going to switch
screwdriver<00:03:02.810> bits<00:03:03.140> to<00:03:03.920> a<00:03:04.450> t10<00:03:06.700> which<00:03:07.700> should

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
screwdriver bits to a t10 which should

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.780 
screwdriver bits to a t10 which should
let<00:03:08.060> you<00:03:08.150> open<00:03:08.239> these<00:03:08.450> black<00:03:08.750> screws<00:03:09.050> here<00:03:09.790> so

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
let you open these black screws here so

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.580 
let you open these black screws here so
let's<00:03:11.030> find<00:03:11.239> the<00:03:11.450> t10<00:03:11.900> that's<00:03:12.440> it<00:03:14.560> so<00:03:15.560> I'm

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
let's find the t10 that's it so I'm

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.800 
let's find the t10 that's it so I'm
going<00:03:15.890> to<00:03:15.920> undo<00:03:16.250> these<00:03:16.400> four<00:03:16.670> screws<00:03:16.819> and<00:03:17.390> cut

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
going to undo these four screws and cut

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.740 
going to undo these four screws and cut
back<00:03:18.019> and<00:03:18.170> down<00:03:18.440> all<00:03:19.310> right<00:03:19.580> all<00:03:19.880> four<00:03:20.360> screws

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
back and down all right all four screws

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.720 
back and down all right all four screws
and<00:03:20.989> then<00:03:21.080> taking<00:03:21.260> off<00:03:21.500> so<00:03:22.069> we're<00:03:22.519> just<00:03:22.549> going

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
and then taking off so we're just going

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.330 
and then taking off so we're just going
to<00:03:22.790> pull<00:03:23.030> this<00:03:23.060> metal<00:03:23.569> piece<00:03:23.720> away<00:03:24.130> as<00:03:25.130> you<00:03:25.250> can

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
to pull this metal piece away as you can

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.100 
to pull this metal piece away as you can
see<00:03:25.549> the<00:03:25.670> hard<00:03:25.910> drive<00:03:26.120> is<00:03:26.150> connected<00:03:26.840> to<00:03:27.080> a

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
see the hard drive is connected to a

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.270 
see the hard drive is connected to a
power<00:03:27.590> and<00:03:28.040> SATA<00:03:28.750> connector<00:03:29.750> so<00:03:30.709> what<00:03:31.130> you're

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
power and SATA connector so what you're

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.729 
power and SATA connector so what you're
going<00:03:31.370> to<00:03:31.430> do<00:03:31.840> preferably<00:03:32.840> with<00:03:33.140> two<00:03:33.500> hands<00:03:34.010> is

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
going to do preferably with two hands is

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:39.190 
going to do preferably with two hands is
slide<00:03:36.739> that<00:03:36.920> off<00:03:37.069> and<00:03:37.850> then<00:03:38.510> you're<00:03:39.019> going<00:03:39.140> to

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
slide that off and then you're going to

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.470 
slide that off and then you're going to
have<00:03:39.260> to<00:03:39.410> kind<00:03:39.620> of<00:03:39.680> lift<00:03:39.950> up<00:03:40.190> on<00:03:40.370> the<00:03:40.400> metal<00:03:40.700> to

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
have to kind of lift up on the metal to

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.949 
have to kind of lift up on the metal to
get<00:03:41.600> the<00:03:41.720> drive<00:03:41.959> out<00:03:42.200> and<00:03:43.450> just<00:03:44.450> pull<00:03:44.720> that<00:03:44.930> out

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
get the drive out and just pull that out

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.860 
get the drive out and just pull that out
and<00:03:45.200> you<00:03:45.530> can<00:03:45.560> see<00:03:45.830> this<00:03:45.980> is<00:03:46.190> a<00:03:46.420> stock<00:03:47.420> see<00:03:47.840> a

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
and you can see this is a stock see a

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.690 
and you can see this is a stock see a
28-year<00:03:48.590> by<00:03:48.739> drive<00:03:49.040> that's<00:03:49.850> the<00:03:50.030> frame<00:03:50.299> I

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
28-year by drive that's the frame I

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.680 
28-year by drive that's the frame I
shouldn't<00:03:52.700> actually<00:03:52.790> throw<00:03:53.209> it<00:03:53.359> in<00:03:53.450> the<00:03:53.540> trash

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
shouldn't actually throw it in the trash

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.970 
shouldn't actually throw it in the trash
that's<00:03:54.049> probably<00:03:54.500> a<00:03:54.590> bad<00:03:54.769> idea<00:03:54.940> and<00:03:56.829> so<00:03:57.829> this

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
that's probably a bad idea and so this

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.960 
that's probably a bad idea and so this
is<00:03:58.190> our<00:03:58.579> western<00:03:59.540> digital<00:03:59.959> babs<00:04:00.230> drop<00:04:00.970> pre

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
is our western digital babs drop pre

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:08.800 
is our western digital babs drop pre
flashed<00:04:02.769> and<00:04:04.329> we<00:04:05.329> just<00:04:05.540> slide<00:04:06.440> it<00:04:06.680> in<00:04:07.810> the

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
flashed and we just slide it in the

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.060 
flashed and we just slide it in the
metal<00:04:09.670> getting<00:04:10.670> up<00:04:10.760> the<00:04:10.880> lift<00:04:11.090> up<00:04:11.269> a<00:04:11.420> little

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.070 
metal getting up the lift up a little

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.080 
metal getting up the lift up a little
just<00:04:13.070> like<00:04:13.250> when<00:04:13.400> you're<00:04:13.609> pulling<00:04:13.820> the<00:04:13.940> other

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
just like when you're pulling the other

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.190 
just like when you're pulling the other
one<00:04:14.180> out<00:04:15.669> and<00:04:16.669> then<00:04:16.910> I<00:04:16.940> stick<00:04:17.600> this<00:04:17.720> connector

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
one out and then I stick this connector

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.590 
one out and then I stick this connector
back<00:04:18.380> on<00:04:18.590> and<00:04:19.489> I'm<00:04:19.669> going<00:04:19.940> to<00:04:20.000> set<00:04:20.209> the<00:04:20.299> camera

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
back on and I'm going to set the camera

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:34.380 
back on and I'm going to set the camera
down<00:04:20.630> for<00:04:20.959> this

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:40.540 

alright<00:04:35.530> so<00:04:36.530> I<00:04:37.870> reconnected<00:04:38.870> that<00:04:39.310> so<00:04:40.310> you<00:04:40.430> can

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
alright so I reconnected that so you can

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.420 
alright so I reconnected that so you can
see<00:04:40.820> it<00:04:41.450> lines<00:04:41.690> up<00:04:41.840> nice<00:04:42.020> and<00:04:42.050> flush<00:04:42.500> now

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
see it lines up nice and flush now

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.570 
see it lines up nice and flush now
you're<00:04:43.580> going<00:04:43.760> to<00:04:43.850> want<00:04:43.970> to<00:04:44.150> slide<00:04:44.420> the<00:04:44.780> drive

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
you're going to want to slide the drive

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.570 
you're going to want to slide the drive
so<00:04:46.580> you<00:04:46.850> know<00:04:46.970> slide<00:04:47.390> the<00:04:47.540> drive<00:04:47.750> over<00:04:48.430> you<00:04:49.430> can

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
so you know slide the drive over you can

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.050 
so you know slide the drive over you can
see<00:04:49.760> how<00:04:49.940> the<00:04:50.780> pieces<00:04:51.020> of<00:04:51.230> plastic<00:04:51.590> over

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
see how the pieces of plastic over

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.750 
see how the pieces of plastic over
because<00:04:53.060> that<00:04:53.810> pushes<00:04:54.290> down<00:04:54.560> on<00:04:54.620> the<00:04:55.550> part

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
because that pushes down on the part

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.280 
because that pushes down on the part
that<00:04:55.910> goes<00:04:56.000> into<00:04:56.210> the<00:04:56.330> 360<00:04:56.870> so<00:04:57.020> you<00:04:57.080> got<00:04:57.200> to

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290 
that goes into the 360 so you got to

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.980 
that goes into the 360 so you got to
make<00:04:57.380> sure<00:04:57.440> that's<00:04:57.860> covered<00:04:58.220> up<00:04:58.370> and<00:04:58.990> it's

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
make sure that's covered up and it's

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.310 
make sure that's covered up and it's
also<00:05:00.170> so<00:05:00.500> these<00:05:00.650> screw<00:05:01.100> holes<00:05:01.370> long<00:05:01.640> enough<00:05:02.320> so

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 
trying to get this piece back on which

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.530 
trying to get this piece back on which
is<00:05:51.940> kind<00:05:52.940> of<00:05:53.060> tricky<00:05:54.640> all<00:05:55.640> right<00:05:55.970> actually<00:05:56.270> I

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:56.540 
is kind of tricky all right actually I

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.210 
is kind of tricky all right actually I
that<00:05:56.690> on<00:05:56.810> camera<00:05:57.050> basically<00:05:58.040> you're<00:05:58.190> just

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:58.220 
that on camera basically you're just

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.540 
that on camera basically you're just
gonna<00:05:58.490> you<00:05:58.790> guys<00:05:58.970> push<00:05:59.870> forward<00:06:00.680> so<00:06:01.310> you<00:06:01.400> gotta

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:01.550 
gonna you guys push forward so you gotta

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.950 
gonna you guys push forward so you gotta
push<00:06:01.790> like<00:06:02.030> that<00:06:02.980> and<00:06:04.420> there's<00:06:05.420> little<00:06:05.690> hooks

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:05.960 
push like that and there's little hooks

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.140 
push like that and there's little hooks
that<00:06:06.560> you<00:06:06.680> have<00:06:06.770> to<00:06:06.920> want<00:06:07.100> up<00:06:07.310> basically<00:06:07.820> and

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:08.150 
that you have to want up basically and

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.600 
that you have to want up basically and
then<00:06:08.810> that<00:06:09.140> just<00:06:09.350> snaps<00:06:09.590> together<00:06:09.770> and<00:06:10.370> unless

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:10.610 
then that just snaps together and unless

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:14.290 
then that just snaps together and unless
you<00:06:10.730> have<00:06:10.850> that<00:06:11.350> Phil<00:06:12.350> drive<00:06:12.650> is<00:06:13.120> pretty<00:06:14.120> much

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:14.300 
you have that Phil drive is pretty much

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.640 
you have that Phil drive is pretty much
secure<00:06:16.180> that<00:06:17.180> part<00:06:17.420> is<00:06:17.570> these<00:06:17.960> have<00:06:18.320> to<00:06:18.470> put

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:18.650 
secure that part is these have to put

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:22.000 
secure that part is these have to put
the<00:06:18.680> screws<00:06:19.010> back<00:06:19.040> in<00:06:19.280> so<00:06:20.680> put<00:06:21.680> all<00:06:21.800> four

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:22.010 
the screws back in so put all four

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:23.290 
the screws back in so put all four
industries<00:06:22.430> back<00:06:22.640> in<00:06:22.670> and<00:06:22.940> you<00:06:23.090> have<00:06:23.180> to

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:23.300 
industries back in and you have to

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.000 
industries back in and you have to
switch<00:06:23.540> bits<00:06:23.840> again<00:06:24.170> obviously<00:06:24.890> because

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:25.010 
switch bits again obviously because

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:28.930 
switch bits again obviously because
these<00:06:25.190> are<00:06:25.370> smaller<00:06:25.870> screws<00:06:27.640> but<00:06:28.640> that<00:06:28.760> pretty

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:28.940 
these are smaller screws but that pretty

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:32.500 
these are smaller screws but that pretty
much<00:06:29.090> sums<00:06:29.390> it<00:06:29.570> up<00:06:30.490> I'm<00:06:31.490> going<00:06:31.610> to<00:06:31.670> finish<00:06:32.000> this

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:32.510 
much sums it up I'm going to finish this

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:34.600 
much sums it up I'm going to finish this
drive<00:06:32.870> up<00:06:33.110> and<00:06:33.260> then<00:06:33.770> I'll<00:06:34.040> come<00:06:34.280> back<00:06:34.430> with

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:34.610 
drive up and then I'll come back with

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:36.080 
drive up and then I'll come back with
some<00:06:34.910> final

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:36.090
