00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
in the manual happy birthday to me stage

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.830 
in the manual happy birthday to me stage
one<00:03:11.220> looks<00:03:12.220> to<00:03:12.370> be<00:03:12.519> the<00:03:12.790> Joker<00:03:13.180> as<00:03:13.299> well<00:03:13.480> so

that's<00:03:14.140> the<00:03:14.560> same<00:03:15.420> this<00:03:16.420> is<00:03:16.570> the<00:03:16.690> same<00:03:16.930> but

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
that's the same this is the same but

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:19.349 
that's the same this is the same but
then<00:03:17.230> in<00:03:17.350> different<00:03:17.680> languages<00:03:18.100> two<00:03:19.030> sided

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:19.359 
then in different languages two sided

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:21.960 
then in different languages two sided
stories<00:03:19.959> so<00:03:20.170> that's<00:03:20.350> probably<00:03:20.709> two<00:03:21.370> faced<00:03:21.670> in

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
stories so that's probably two faced in

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.420

the<00:03:22.810> second<00:03:23.230> level<00:03:23.410> which<00:03:23.739> is<00:03:23.920> not<00:03:24.100> the<00:03:24.220> same

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
the second level which is not the same

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.009 
the second level which is not the same
then<00:03:25.329> the<00:03:25.359> third<00:03:25.720> level<00:03:25.900> we<00:03:26.500> have<00:03:26.769> tea<00:03:27.640> time

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.720 
then the third level we have tea time
which<00:03:29.019> is<00:03:29.200> again<00:03:29.530> not<00:03:29.920> the<00:03:30.130> same<00:03:30.370> because<00:03:30.579> this

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
which is again not the same because this

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.759 
which is again not the same because this
is<00:03:30.910> one<00:03:31.150> of<00:03:31.180> those<00:03:31.420> bad<00:03:31.750> guys<00:03:31.930> based<00:03:32.260> on<00:03:32.440> Alice
