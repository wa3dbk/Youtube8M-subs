then<00:02:38.239> we'll<00:02:38.390> hit<00:02:38.629> a<00:02:38.660> lob<00:02:38.900> snap<00:02:40.810> then<00:02:42.040> come<00:02:43.040> up

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
then we'll hit a lob snap then come up

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:50.559 
then we'll hit a lob snap then come up
we're<00:02:45.769> going<00:02:45.890> to<00:02:45.950> take<00:02:46.190> this<00:02:46.819> and<00:02:49.360> push<00:02:50.360> it

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
we're going to take this and push it

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.680 
we're going to take this and push it
down<00:02:50.750> his<00:02:51.049> head<00:02:51.170> will<00:02:51.290> come<00:02:51.440> out<00:02:52.599> there's<00:02:53.599> a

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
down his head will come out there's a

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.470 
down his head will come out there's a
white<00:02:54.170> tab<00:02:54.380> right<00:02:54.590> here<00:02:54.620> and<00:02:55.209> rotate<00:02:56.209> this

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
white tab right here and rotate this

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.940 
white tab right here and rotate this
around<00:02:56.540> and<00:02:56.989> this<00:02:57.769> really<00:02:57.980> adds<00:02:59.950> difference

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
around and this really adds difference

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.119 
around and this really adds difference

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.759 

we<00:03:10.010> take<00:03:10.220> the<00:03:10.340> arms<00:03:10.579> around<00:03:11.500> pull<00:03:12.500> out<00:03:12.650> the

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
we take the arms around pull out the

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:17.830 
we take the arms around pull out the
hands<00:03:14.319> unhinge<00:03:15.319> the<00:03:15.440> panels<00:03:16.810> rotate<00:03:17.810> the

his robot mode I really like this figure
this<00:03:36.859> figure<00:03:37.099> is<00:03:37.489> at<00:03:38.420> least<00:03:38.599> in<00:03:38.840> my<00:03:39.049> own

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
this figure is at least in my own

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.849
