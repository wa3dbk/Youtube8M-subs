hey guys this is crunch part 3 and this
time<00:00:03.929> I<00:00:04.140> make<00:00:04.350> a<00:00:04.380> little<00:00:04.500> smaller<00:00:05.009> the<00:00:05.250> screen

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
time I make a little smaller the screen

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.930 
time I make a little smaller the screen
I'm<00:00:05.700> trying<00:00:06.029> new<00:00:06.299> techniques<00:00:06.629> now<00:00:07.109> of

I'm trying new techniques now of

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.910 
I'm trying new techniques now of
adapting<00:00:08.940> this<00:00:09.090> movie<00:00:09.809> adapting<00:00:10.500> some<00:00:10.710> things

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
I'm making it to it anyways a a lot of

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.300 
I'm making it to it anyways a a lot of
time<00:00:14.700> has<00:00:14.880> passed<00:00:14.969> as<00:00:15.500> it's<00:00:16.500> possible<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:17.100> see

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
time has passed as it's possible to see

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.220 
time has passed as it's possible to see
and<00:00:18.170> I've<00:00:19.170> conquered<00:00:19.619> that<00:00:20.689> bottom<00:00:21.689> island<00:00:22.140> to

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
and I've conquered that bottom island to

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.710 
and I've conquered that bottom island to
the<00:00:22.289> left<00:00:22.529> there<00:00:23.000> I'll<00:00:24.000> try<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.359> make<00:00:24.570> the

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
the left there I'll try to make the

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.330 
the left there I'll try to make the
screen<00:00:25.050> little<00:00:25.289> smaller<00:00:25.650> here<00:00:25.920> so<00:00:26.099> you<00:00:26.160> can

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
screen little smaller here so you can

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.390 
screen little smaller here so you can
see<00:00:26.369> it<00:00:26.609> better<00:00:26.760> there<00:00:27.210> you<00:00:27.390> go<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:28.220> you<00:00:29.220> can

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
see it better there you go and you can

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.189 
see it better there you go and you can
see<00:00:29.580> I'm<00:00:29.939> just<00:00:30.060> finishing<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.869> game<00:00:31.050> right

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
these transports my two main islands my

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.139 
these transports my two main islands my
main<00:00:43.379> island<00:00:43.920> now<00:00:44.070> because<00:00:44.579> if<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.850> hoover

made it what made it possible for this

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.340 
made it what made it possible for this
to<00:01:15.119> happen<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.420> can<00:01:15.630> see<00:01:15.750> just<00:01:15.780> pushing<00:01:16.290> me

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
to happen you can see just pushing me

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.719 
to happen you can see just pushing me
dis<00:01:16.530> transport<00:01:17.040> saying<00:01:17.220> I<00:01:17.310> was<00:01:17.460> able<00:01:17.580> to

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
dis transport saying I was able to

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.370 
dis transport saying I was able to
connect<00:01:17.970> them<00:01:18.090> straight<00:01:18.900> from<00:01:19.110> Mile<00:01:19.290> Island

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
connect them straight from Mile Island

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.070 
connect them straight from Mile Island
their<00:01:20.040> Island<00:01:20.460> here<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:20.850> one<00:01:21.689> round<00:01:21.930> because

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
their Island here and one round because

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.800 
their Island here and one round because
if<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:22.500> technique<00:01:23.340> which<00:01:23.549> can<00:01:23.820> transport<00:01:24.390> units

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
if I technique which can transport units

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.200 
if I technique which can transport units
from<00:01:25.080> one<00:01:25.290> transport<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:25.979> other<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.430> so

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
from one transport to the other and so

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.560 
from one transport to the other and so
on<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.509> so<00:01:27.570> forth<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:29.180> now<00:01:30.180> I'm<00:01:30.390> just

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
on and so forth and now I'm just

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.080 
on and so forth and now I'm just
conquering<00:01:31.020> all<00:01:31.200> these<00:01:31.700> cities<00:01:32.700> young<00:01:32.909> guy

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
conquering all these cities young guy

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.190 
conquering all these cities young guy
guntown<00:01:33.840> Beijing<00:01:34.470> Nanking<00:01:35.430> or<00:01:36.360> whatever<00:01:36.869> i'm

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
guntown Beijing Nanking or whatever i'm

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.149 
guntown Beijing Nanking or whatever i'm
not<00:01:37.409> an<00:01:37.860> expert<00:01:38.100> in<00:01:38.340> pronouncing<00:01:39.890> city<00:01:40.890> name

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
not an expert in pronouncing city name

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.820 
not an expert in pronouncing city name
so

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.900 

anyways<00:01:44.830> and<00:01:46.440> this<00:01:47.440> if<00:01:47.830> this<00:01:48.370> video<00:01:48.580> actually

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:48.910 
anyways and this if this video actually

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.200 
anyways and this if this video actually
works<00:01:49.420> it<00:01:50.050> will<00:01:50.140> be<00:01:50.430> quite<00:01:51.430> longer<00:01:51.940> than<00:01:52.090> the

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
works it will be quite longer than the

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.510 
works it will be quite longer than the
other<00:01:52.330> one<00:01:52.510> and<00:01:52.690> possibly<00:01:53.020> i<00:01:53.440> will<00:01:53.950> keep<00:01:54.160> using

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
other one and possibly i will keep using

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.820 
other one and possibly i will keep using
this<00:01:54.940> style<00:01:55.660> of<00:01:55.870> video<00:01:56.050> even<00:01:56.440> though<00:01:56.470> it<00:01:56.710> may

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
this style of video even though it may

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.620 
this style of video even though it may
be<00:01:56.890> not<00:01:57.100> as<00:01:57.310> pleasant<00:01:57.700> to<00:01:58.030> view<00:01:58.210> as<00:01:58.390> the<00:01:58.510> other

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
be not as pleasant to view as the other

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.270 
be not as pleasant to view as the other
one<00:01:58.810> is<00:01:58.920> then<00:01:59.920> what<00:02:00.040> the<00:02:00.280> best<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:01.540> be<00:02:01.690> used<00:02:02.280> so

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
one is then what the best to be used so

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.920 
one is then what the best to be used so
