buildings<00:00:29.369> aren't<00:00:29.609> glued<00:00:30.060> down<00:00:30.330> I've<00:00:30.660> put

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
buildings aren't glued down I've put

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.870 
buildings aren't glued down I've put
them<00:00:30.960> on<00:00:31.080> there<00:00:31.230> so<00:00:31.410> you<00:00:31.470> can<00:00:32.460> sort<00:00:32.610> of<00:00:32.640> get<00:00:32.820> an

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
them on there so you can sort of get an

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.190 
them on there so you can sort of get an
idea<00:00:32.940> of<00:00:33.210> how<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.450> board<00:00:33.660> will<00:00:33.840> look<00:00:33.960> when

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
idea of how the board will look when

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.209 
idea of how the board will look when
it's<00:00:34.350> done<00:00:34.700> so<00:00:35.700> that's<00:00:35.850> all<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.210> towns<00:00:37.219> you

can<00:00:38.370> see<00:00:38.520> us<00:00:38.670> all<00:00:39.020> around<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.170> edges<00:00:40.290> just

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
can see us all around the edges just

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.610 
can see us all around the edges just
sort<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:40.980> waved<00:00:41.760> it<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.030> bit<00:00:42.210> just<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.750> I'm<00:00:43.440> gonna

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
can see there how they're being done so

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.200

no<00:01:28.049> windows<00:01:28.409> no<00:01:28.590> doors<00:01:28.619> painted<00:01:29.159> that<00:01:30.030> would

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
no windows no doors painted that would

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.420 
no windows no doors painted that would
just<00:01:30.450> dual<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.290> attention<00:01:31.710> away<00:01:31.799> from<00:01:31.950> the

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
just dual the attention away from the

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.090 
just dual the attention away from the
sort<00:01:33.119> of<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.329> scope<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.869> board<00:01:34.049> I<00:01:34.259> don't

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
sort of the scope of the board I don't

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.170 
sort of the scope of the board I don't
really<00:01:35.220> want<00:01:35.430> that<00:01:35.490> so<00:01:36.530> they<00:01:37.530> just<00:01:37.560> sort<00:01:37.920> of

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
really want that so they just sort of

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.670 
really want that so they just sort of
give<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.299> impression<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.689> buildings<00:01:40.079> which

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
give the impression of buildings which

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.480 
give the impression of buildings which
from<00:01:40.950> this<00:01:41.159> distance<00:01:41.579> I<00:01:41.899> think<00:01:42.950> okay<00:01:43.950> looks

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
from this distance I think okay looks

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.179 
from this distance I think okay looks
quite<00:01:44.729> good<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.810> especially<00:01:46.320> once<00:01:46.710> all<00:01:47.009> those

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
quite good and especially once all those

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.600 
quite good and especially once all those
ones<00:01:47.399> are<00:01:47.520> done<00:01:47.640> I<00:01:49.280> think<00:01:50.280> it<00:01:50.369> should<00:01:50.490> be<00:01:50.549> a

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
ones are done I think it should be a

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.580 
ones are done I think it should be a
pretty<00:01:50.850> impressive<00:01:51.060> looking<00:01:51.479> board<00:01:51.720> yeah<00:01:52.439> so

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
pretty impressive looking board yeah so

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
pretty impressive looking board yeah so
