because<00:04:06.319> the<00:04:07.319> first<00:04:07.560> time<00:04:07.799> tethering<00:04:08.190> was

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
because the first time tethering was

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.039 
because the first time tethering was
available<00:04:08.609> is<00:04:08.970> out<00:04:09.150> in<00:04:09.329> the<00:04:09.359> app<00:04:09.599> store<00:04:09.629> for

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
available is out in the app store for

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:14.390 
available is out in the app store for
about<00:04:10.319> two<00:04:10.799> minutes<00:04:10.980> on<00:04:11.510> I'm<00:04:12.510> assuming<00:04:13.049> and<00:04:13.400> I

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
about two minutes on I'm assuming and I

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.569 
about two minutes on I'm assuming and I
guess<00:04:14.609> the<00:04:14.730> developer<00:04:15.239> I<00:04:15.709> said<00:04:16.709> hey<00:04:16.889> here<00:04:17.340> I

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
guess the developer I said hey here I

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.180 
guess the developer I said hey here I
want<00:04:18.299> this<00:04:18.419> to<00:04:18.599> happen<00:04:18.780> and<00:04:19.289> Apple<00:04:19.829> getting

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
want this to happen and Apple getting

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.730 
want this to happen and Apple getting
check<00:04:20.639> it<00:04:20.789> over<00:04:20.940> good<00:04:21.329> with<00:04:21.570> 18<00:04:21.989> G's<00:04:22.229> contract

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
check it over good with 18 G's contract

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.430 
check it over good with 18 G's contract
or<00:04:22.919> whatever<00:04:23.190> and<00:04:23.550> it<00:04:24.360> was<00:04:24.479> an<00:04:24.630> app<00:04:24.810> store<00:04:25.110> I'm

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
or whatever and it was an app store I'm

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.379 
or whatever and it was an app store I'm
assuming<00:04:26.039> for<00:04:26.190> about<00:04:26.370> 10<00:04:26.729> minutes

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
assuming for about 10 minutes

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:31.420 
assuming for about 10 minutes
so<00:04:28.310> they<00:04:29.310> were<00:04:29.370> they<00:04:30.060> took<00:04:30.270> it<00:04:30.360> out<00:04:30.479> basically

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
so they were they took it out basically

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.730 
so they were they took it out basically
if<00:04:32.430> it<00:04:32.699> could<00:04:32.879> be<00:04:33.030> supported<00:04:33.629> then<00:04:33.840> why<00:04:34.469> can't

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
if it could be supported then why can't

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.209 
if it could be supported then why can't
they<00:04:34.860> be<00:04:35.009> supported<00:04:35.550> now<00:04:35.699> I<00:04:36.439> don't<00:04:37.439> know<00:04:37.949> they

00:04:38.209 --> 00:04:38.219 
they be supported now I don't know they

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:40.670 
they be supported now I don't know they
