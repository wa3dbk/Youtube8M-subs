00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.559
 fresh clean air gives us one 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:11.650
 healthy basis and contributes significantly to 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:13.420
 regeneration of our body at 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.400
 However, we spend our widths 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.279
 an average of two-thirds of the day 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.960
 fresh in buildings and vehicles 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:22.239
 indoor climate enhances ours 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.840
 satisfaction and therefore also ours 

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:28.119
 Productivity usually you should 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.290
 her house three to four times a day for 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:33.280
 ventilate for at least ten minutes 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.350
 irregular ventilation arise 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.500
 poor air quality and too high 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.969
 humidity 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.890
 these room conditions form one 

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:43.890
 ideal nutrient medium for mold 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.030
 in fact, about 50 are aired 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:51.129
 percent of heating heat through the windows 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.260
 and lost by infiltration 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:54.519
 The money literally becomes a window 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.460
 kicked out 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:59.679
 the supply of fresh air and promotion 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.629
 from hygienic living spaces do not wear 

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:03.789
 only relevant to our health 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:05.250
 but help us beyond that 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:07.870
 save energy 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.300
 Dense building envelope and sealed 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.250
 lower window heating costs lead but 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.070
 also for the massive reduction of one 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.410
 free air exchange 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.390
 controlled ventilation system creates 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.550
 remedy 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.650
 a classic ventilation system 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:28.000
 located in the basement or storeroom 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:30.490
 your building gets fresh air from 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.340
 outside on a clock in the house and 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.830
 via pipelines in the living spaces 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.420
 transported the plant transported the 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.930
 fresh air through the house in the 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.760
 individual rooms classic Zuluft 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.130
 areas are for example the 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:49.780
 living room office or bedroom 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:52.000
 clean air is poured in here 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.220
 exhaust air like kitchen or bathroom 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.200
 toilet where humidity increases 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.030
 occurs, for example, by cooking 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.660
 or shower the damp air 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.190
 sucked 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.960
 the used air will be over 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.670
 pipe system and last through the 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.520
 heat exchanger back outside 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:12.300
 transported and fresh new air passes 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.280
 into the house through the one and dispel the 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.590
 heat exchanger gets the cold 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:21.000
 fresh air the heat flowing by 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:23.190
 the already heated exhaust air a good 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.350
 Sophisticated ventilation system increases 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.750
 noticeable the quality in your living and 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.120
 workrooms and in comparison to 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.650
 Airing over open windows goes with it 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.650
 hardly any heat energy lost 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.640
 a ventilation system is 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.350
 However, space saving should be one 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.820
 whole system already during the 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.700
 planning phase of the building 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.890
 be taken into account 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:50.220
 the ventilation system offers 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.020
 Clean air without them around the clock 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.410
 Ventilation becomes a mold 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.720
 free living atmosphere guaranteed by 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.670
 they protect the targeted air exchange 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.980
