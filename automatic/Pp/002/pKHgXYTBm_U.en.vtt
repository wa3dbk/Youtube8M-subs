00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:41.049 
turn up the decay a little bit there so

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:55.350 
turn up the decay a little bit there so

aterna and then we will switch to the

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.460 
aterna and then we will switch to the
big<00:02:02.330> room<00:02:02.539> with<00:02:02.570> a<00:02:02.840> view<00:02:03.939> and<00:02:05.110> go<00:02:06.110> with<00:02:06.259> those

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
big room with a view and go with those

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:25.650 
big room with a view and go with those
settings<00:02:06.860> for<00:02:07.759> that<00:02:07.909> here<00:02:08.509> is<00:02:08.720> the<00:02:08.989> eternity<00:02:09.649> n

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:49.180 

and<00:02:26.660> the<00:02:27.500> big<00:02:27.710> room<00:02:27.950> with<00:02:27.980> a<00:02:28.220> view<00:02:28.340> tone

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:03:27.060 

you

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.370 

and<00:03:28.070> that<00:03:28.910> of<00:03:29.120> course<00:03:29.150> on<00:03:29.660> the<00:03:29.840> aterna<00:03:30.170> is

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
and that of course on the aterna is

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.200 
and that of course on the aterna is
actually<00:03:30.710> not<00:03:30.830> using<00:03:31.190> much<00:03:31.430> of<00:03:31.700> the<00:03:31.850> shimmer

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:32.210 
actually not using much of the shimmer

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.030 
actually not using much of the shimmer
so<00:03:32.870> let's<00:03:33.020> just<00:03:33.080> crank<00:03:33.470> that<00:03:33.650> a<00:03:33.710> little<00:03:33.980> bit

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
so let's just crank that a little bit

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.220 
so let's just crank that a little bit
and<00:03:34.250> you'll<00:03:34.460> begin<00:03:34.700> to<00:03:34.760> see<00:03:34.960> some<00:03:35.960> more<00:03:36.110> the

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
and you'll begin to see some more the

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:43.730 
and you'll begin to see some more the
capabilities<00:03:36.800> of<00:03:36.830> the<00:03:37.070> aterna

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:43.740 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:50.470 

you

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.830 

and<00:03:52.220> then<00:03:53.220> I'll<00:03:53.460> crank<00:03:53.790> the<00:03:53.970> mix<00:03:54.210> and<00:03:54.450> the

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
and then I'll crank the mix and the

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.710 
and then I'll crank the mix and the
aterna<00:03:55.200> does<00:03:55.500> a<00:03:55.910> 100-percent<00:03:56.910> wet<00:03:57.060> signal<00:03:57.510> so

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
aterna does a 100-percent wet signal so

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.660 
aterna does a 100-percent wet signal so
they'll<00:03:57.930> only<00:03:58.200> be<00:03:58.350> the<00:03:58.590> affected<00:03:59.190> guitar

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
they'll only be the affected guitar

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:14.059 
they'll only be the affected guitar
signal<00:03:59.850> coming<00:04:00.180> through<00:04:00.270> now

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:16.490 

and<00:04:14.159> let's<00:04:15.030> see<00:04:15.269> if<00:04:15.510> these<00:04:15.689> tone<00:04:16.019> prints<00:04:16.350> do

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
and let's see if these tone prints do

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:27.090 
and let's see if these tone prints do
that

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:33.990 

I<00:04:31.410> could<00:04:32.410> still<00:04:32.560> hear<00:04:32.760> some<00:04:33.760> of<00:04:33.790> the<00:04:33.910> original

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
I could still hear some of the original

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.970 
I could still hear some of the original
guitar<00:04:34.570> signal<00:04:34.780> it<00:04:35.080> may<00:04:35.230> be<00:04:35.290> hard<00:04:35.590> to<00:04:35.650> hear

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:35.980 
guitar signal it may be hard to hear

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.190 
guitar signal it may be hard to hear
because<00:04:36.130> it's<00:04:36.490> basically<00:04:36.900> maxing<00:04:37.900> out<00:04:37.990> the

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
because it's basically maxing out the

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.340 
because it's basically maxing out the
amount<00:04:38.440> of<00:04:39.000> reverb<00:04:40.000> or<00:04:40.420> wet<00:04:40.780> signal<00:04:41.200> you<00:04:41.320> can

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
amount of reverb or wet signal you can

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.640 
amount of reverb or wet signal you can
have<00:04:41.650> on<00:04:41.830> top<00:04:42.330> let's<00:04:43.330> switch<00:04:43.630> to<00:04:43.660> the<00:04:44.020> e1

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
have on top let's switch to the e1

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.270 
have on top let's switch to the e1
setting<00:04:45.130> and<00:04:45.900> just<00:04:46.900> increase<00:04:47.320> the<00:04:47.350> decay<00:04:47.950> so

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
setting and just increase the decay so

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.340 
setting and just increase the decay so
it's<00:04:48.490> a<00:04:48.580> little<00:04:48.700> bit<00:04:48.790> more<00:04:49.000> fair<00:04:49.360> find<00:04:50.110> the

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
it's a little bit more fair find the

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.320 
it's a little bit more fair find the
decay<00:04:51.100> is<00:04:51.280> not<00:04:51.430> as<00:04:51.580> strong<00:04:51.850> in<00:04:52.000> this<00:04:52.120> setting

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
decay is not as strong in this setting

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.860 
decay is not as strong in this setting
and<00:04:52.540> I'll<00:04:52.990> crank<00:04:53.230> the<00:04:53.380> mix<00:04:53.590> let's<00:04:54.430> just<00:04:54.520> see

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
and I'll crank the mix let's just see

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:06.750 
and I'll crank the mix let's just see
how<00:04:55.870> the<00:04:55.930> e1<00:04:56.320> setting<00:04:56.680> compares

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.410 

so<00:05:07.760> both<00:05:08.330> of<00:05:08.360> those<00:05:08.630> tone<00:05:09.200> prints<00:05:09.560> the<00:05:09.650> e1<00:05:10.010> and

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:10.420 
so both of those tone prints the e1 and

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.030 
so both of those tone prints the e1 and
the<00:05:11.420> big<00:05:11.600> room<00:05:11.780> with<00:05:11.930> view<00:05:12.200> do<00:05:12.350> not<00:05:12.530> do<00:05:12.770> one

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:13.040 
the big room with view do not do one

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.850 
the big room with view do not do one
hundred<00:05:13.370> percent<00:05:13.400> wet<00:05:13.820> and<00:05:14.740> there's<00:05:15.740> a

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
hundred percent wet and there's a

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.080 
hundred percent wet and there's a
comparison<00:05:16.310> for<00:05:16.460> you<00:05:16.550> folks<00:05:16.700> thanks<00:05:17.060> for
