00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:09.120
 brought here and in this video I will show how 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:13.200
 make infinite brilliant green on any 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:16.740
 server which maybe i'm a trolley or 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:20.760
 the boat is so first well for starters us 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.560
 first you need a trolley here since we 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.140
 surround 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.949
 everything is clear further we need potions or 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.869
 a vein of experience 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:32.579
 that is what we will do our own 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:34.410
 infinitely and one chest when we want 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.129
 make endless we 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:42.090
 we include yurik year sit down in 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:44.040
 we open the trolley 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:49.590
 the cursor on zilya 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:56.280
 our friend floats a chest breaking well we 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:59.300
 yedinichku times through two three 4 5 6 7 8 9 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:03.090
 you can calmly pick them up at the post 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:06.450
 To not screw it up you first need to go out 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.820
 from the trolley and the flow and spring it and how 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:13.049
 we see that we have endless 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:16.409
 business here they are infinitely leh yu 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.450
 I'll add my main Raspletina 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.090
 friend's chest write creams on it 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:25.560
 otherwise he will not be able to break this 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:28.710
 the main thing and how to go ashore and we are clearly 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.610
 endless spice products can be thrown 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.610
 as fast as possible 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.170
 as we see and sat down and started to stack 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.840
 here at the moment in the opinion of 100 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.590
 weeks it's not scary don't be afraid 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.659
 just about throw them to the end like we 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.000
 we see potions come to zero 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.149
 close enough war 2 potions of heaven not 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.700
 worry it's not scary we throw 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:54.540
 potions disappear for one second and back 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:57.390
 in inventory and onwards so grips and behold 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.890
 so here is the flizelin that we did with 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.009
 using a family name 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.049
 by the way after we did it 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.700
 we have also a step knocked off glasses and 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:09.479
 potions but states 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.910
 they are somehow better than infinitely 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.930
 because it's infinite if you throw it away 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:18.599
 here and then not to catch 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:23.400
 no worse not to try try to 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:26.160
 do not drink the same I can not take them and here 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.260
 By this, I myself will prove to him that to raise them 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.160
 can not a glass of potion they like 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:35.340
 end but this is bad but plus something 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:39.950
 that if you die then ate these then 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:44.030
 can pick up and also in this release i 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:46.530
 I can tell you for sure that these potions are 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.750
 absolutely infinite they never 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.090
 run out of nowhere if you donâ€™t 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:56.940
 transmit if you don't perry go in and out 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:58.890
 games and they will not die not throw out 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.280
 Yes, if we do not throw them out or drank 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:05.209
 go inside and with you was a cactus all 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.209
 good luck everyone
