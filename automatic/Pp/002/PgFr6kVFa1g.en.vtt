00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
heat it up a little bit more just kind

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.010 
heat it up a little bit more just kind
of<00:04:12.680> grazing<00:04:13.040> the<00:04:13.250> heat<00:04:13.430> over<00:04:13.700> it<00:04:13.820> too<00:04:14.600> I'm

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:15.020 
of grazing the heat over it too I'm

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:26.020 
of grazing the heat over it too I'm
loosen<00:04:15.500> the<00:04:15.590> glue<00:04:15.770> and<00:04:24.520> you're<00:04:25.520> going<00:04:25.730> to<00:04:25.820> push

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
loosen the glue and you're going to push

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.230 
loosen the glue and you're going to push
it<00:04:26.210> through<00:04:27.190> that<00:04:28.190> hole<00:04:28.520> that<00:04:28.670> you've<00:04:28.820> made

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
it through that hole that you've made

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.310 
it through that hole that you've made
and<00:04:29.680> you<00:04:30.680> should<00:04:30.920> see<00:04:31.330> the<00:04:32.330> pan<00:04:32.630> is<00:04:32.900> starting

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
and you should see the pan is starting

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:43.350 
and you should see the pan is starting
to<00:04:33.530> lift<00:04:33.800> out<00:04:34.190> of<00:04:34.930> the<00:04:35.930> little<00:04:36.110> container<00:04:36.470> guy

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.480 

and<00:04:44.360> now<00:04:44.570> the<00:04:44.630> pandas<00:04:45.620> metal<00:04:46.070> part<00:04:46.250> is<00:04:46.340> going

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
and now the pandas metal part is going

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.960 
and now the pandas metal part is going
to<00:04:46.580> be<00:04:46.640> hot<00:04:46.970> because<00:04:48.070> yeah<00:04:49.070> but<00:04:49.340> it<00:04:49.520> does<00:04:49.760> have

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
to be hot because yeah but it does have

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.740 
to be hot because yeah but it does have
the<00:04:50.120> glue<00:04:50.330> on<00:04:50.360> it<00:04:51.130> as<00:04:52.130> you<00:04:52.460> can<00:04:52.610> see<00:04:53.030> there<00:04:53.480> it

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
the glue on it as you can see there it

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.650 
the glue on it as you can see there it
is<00:04:53.810> out<00:04:54.260> there<00:04:55.100> is<00:04:55.220> very<00:04:55.490> minimal<00:04:55.970> damage<00:04:56.210> to

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
is out there is very minimal damage to

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.530 
is out there is very minimal damage to
this<00:04:57.050> pan<00:04:57.470> which<00:04:57.920> is<00:04:58.100> good<00:04:58.340> because<00:04:58.550> that<00:04:58.940> way

00:04:59.530 --> 00:04:59.540 
this pan which is good because that way

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:04.780 
this pan which is good because that way
you<00:05:00.790> can<00:05:01.790> still<00:05:02.060> back<00:05:02.240> to<00:05:02.450> Mack<00:05:02.660> it<00:05:03.430> so<00:05:04.430> the<00:05:04.550> pan

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
you can still back to Mack it so the pan

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.630 
you can still back to Mack it so the pan
is<00:05:04.970> out<00:05:05.260> then<00:05:06.260> just<00:05:06.500> take<00:05:06.710> the<00:05:06.920> silverton<00:05:07.430> this

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:07.640 
is out then just take the silverton this

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.670 
is out then just take the silverton this
one<00:05:07.850> is<00:05:07.970> from<00:05:08.120> Coastal<00:05:08.510> Scents<00:05:08.630> fits<00:05:09.320> right<00:05:09.530> in

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
one is from Coastal Scents fits right in

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.300 
one is from Coastal Scents fits right in
there<00:05:09.800> perfectly<00:05:09.980> pop<00:05:10.940> it<00:05:11.150> back<00:05:11.180> in<00:05:11.690> and<00:05:12.310> it

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
there perfectly pop it back in and it

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:14.950 
there perfectly pop it back in and it
just<00:05:13.580> looks<00:05:13.880> like<00:05:14.210> you<00:05:14.420> finished<00:05:14.840> the

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
just looks like you finished the

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.110 
just looks like you finished the
eyeshadow<00:05:15.410> and<00:05:15.710> it's<00:05:16.610> still<00:05:16.820> perfectly

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
eyeshadow and it's still perfectly

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.140 
eyeshadow and it's still perfectly
intact<00:05:17.780> so<00:05:18.260> you<00:05:18.320> are<00:05:18.770> able<00:05:19.070> to<00:05:19.670> back<00:05:19.910> to<00:05:20.120> back

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
intact so you are able to back to back

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:25.630 
intact so you are able to back to back
in<00:05:21.130> there<00:05:22.130> you<00:05:22.220> go<00:05:23.680> then<00:05:24.680> what<00:05:25.070> I<00:05:25.100> like<00:05:25.190> to<00:05:25.490> do

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:25.640 
in there you go then what I like to do

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.950 
in there you go then what I like to do
is<00:05:25.910> I<00:05:25.940> just<00:05:26.210> take<00:05:26.390> that<00:05:26.660> glue<00:05:26.960> off<00:05:28.840> because<00:05:29.840> it

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
is I just take that glue off because it

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.560 
is I just take that glue off because it
gets<00:05:30.080> really<00:05:30.260> annoying<00:05:30.970> you<00:05:31.970> can<00:05:32.120> heat<00:05:32.360> it<00:05:32.390> up

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:32.570 
gets really annoying you can heat it up

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:35.620 
gets really annoying you can heat it up
and<00:05:32.810> it<00:05:32.870> will<00:05:32.990> come<00:05:33.230> off<00:05:33.260> easier<00:05:33.860> but<00:05:34.630> peeling

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:35.630 
and it will come off easier but peeling

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:40.210 
and it will come off easier but peeling
off<00:05:35.750> sometimes<00:05:36.170> works<00:05:36.410> as<00:05:36.590> well<00:05:38.470> okay<00:05:39.470> now

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:40.220 
off sometimes works as well okay now

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:41.830 
off sometimes works as well okay now
you'll<00:05:40.460> see<00:05:40.670> that<00:05:40.760> there<00:05:40.940> is<00:05:40.970> still<00:05:41.330> the<00:05:41.480> label

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 
you'll see that there is still the label

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.570 
you'll see that there is still the label
on<00:05:41.930> the<00:05:41.990> back<00:05:42.200> I<00:05:42.410> do<00:05:42.470> want<00:05:42.860> the<00:05:43.010> label<00:05:43.310> on<00:05:43.520> there

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:45.580 
on the back I do want the label on there

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:50.950 
on the back I do want the label on there
want<00:05:46.580> it<00:05:46.880> to<00:05:47.090> be<00:05:47.240> magnetic<00:05:49.300> so<00:05:50.300> in<00:05:50.570> order<00:05:50.840> to

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960 
want it to be magnetic so in order to

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.360 
want it to be magnetic so in order to
make<00:05:51.140> a<00:05:51.200> magnetic<00:05:51.740> we<00:05:51.860> are<00:05:51.980> taking<00:05:52.190> the

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:52.370 
make a magnetic we are taking the

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.150 
make a magnetic we are taking the
magnets<00:05:52.820> and<00:05:53.150> this<00:05:53.690> deserves<00:05:54.080> I'm<00:05:54.860> pretty

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:55.160 
magnets and this deserves I'm pretty

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.390 
magnets and this deserves I'm pretty
good<00:05:55.340> at<00:05:55.400> just<00:05:55.700> guesstimating<00:05:56.060> how<00:05:56.630> big<00:05:56.930> the

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 
good at just guesstimating how big the

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.860 
good at just guesstimating how big the
thing<00:05:58.400> needs<00:05:58.669> to<00:05:58.820> be<00:05:58.940> cut<00:05:59.150> the<00:05:59.390> magnet<00:05:59.780> you

00:05:59.860 --> 00:05:59.870 
thing needs to be cut the magnet you

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:01.480 
thing needs to be cut the magnet you
just<00:06:00.080> want<00:06:00.230> to<00:06:00.260> cut<00:06:00.470> it<00:06:00.590> a<00:06:00.680> little<00:06:00.710> bit<00:06:01.190> smaller

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
just want to cut it a little bit smaller

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:12.880 
just want to cut it a little bit smaller
than<00:06:02.560> the<00:06:03.560> pan<00:06:04.060> size<00:06:07.060> cut<00:06:08.060> a<00:06:08.090> circle<00:06:08.480> there

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:12.890 

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:18.500 

stick<00:06:13.890> it<00:06:14.010> on<00:06:14.160> that<00:06:16.910> way<00:06:17.910> it<00:06:18.000> will<00:06:18.060> stick<00:06:18.300> into

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:18.510 
stick it on that way it will stick into

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:23.570 
stick it on that way it will stick into
the<00:06:18.690> mac<00:06:18.870> palette<00:06:19.350> and<00:06:20.450> then<00:06:21.890> to<00:06:22.890> get<00:06:23.040> this<00:06:23.250> off

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580 
the mac palette and then to get this off

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:28.840 
the mac palette and then to get this off
I<00:06:23.940> just<00:06:24.510> heat<00:06:24.810> up<00:06:24.990> the<00:06:25.230> end<00:06:25.440> of<00:06:27.350> the<00:06:28.350> needle

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:28.850 
I just heat up the end of the needle

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:32.840 
I just heat up the end of the needle
make<00:06:29.850> it<00:06:30.000> warm<00:06:30.270> and<00:06:30.510> then<00:06:31.190> you<00:06:32.190> can<00:06:32.370> just<00:06:32.640> kind

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:32.850 
make it warm and then you can just kind

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:39.440 
make it warm and then you can just kind
of<00:06:32.940> run<00:06:33.240> the<00:06:33.660> edge<00:06:33.840> along<00:06:36.020> the<00:06:37.020> label<00:06:37.470> and<00:06:38.450> it

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:39.450 
of run the edge along the label and it

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:44.540 
of run the edge along the label and it
kind<00:06:39.690> of<00:06:39.720> keeps<00:06:39.900> the<00:06:40.110> glue<00:06:40.320> underneath<00:06:40.530> it<00:06:43.550> and

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:44.550 
kind of keeps the glue underneath it and

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:47.420 
kind of keeps the glue underneath it and
then<00:06:45.090> once<00:06:45.450> you<00:06:45.630> have<00:06:45.780> a<00:06:45.810> little<00:06:46.200> lip<00:06:46.890> you<00:06:47.280> can

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:47.430 
then once you have a little lip you can

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:57.100 
then once you have a little lip you can
just<00:06:47.610> peel<00:06:47.850> it<00:06:47.970> off

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:57.110 

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:58.960 

feel<00:06:57.710> like<00:06:57.830> then<00:06:58.010> you<00:06:58.190> know<00:06:58.400> this<00:06:58.580> is<00:06:58.730> being

00:06:58.960 --> 00:06:58.970 
feel like then you know this is being

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:14.750 
feel like then you know this is being
have<00:06:59.210> nail<00:06:59.420> camera

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:14.760 

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:19.950 

so<00:07:15.760> there's<00:07:16.150> the<00:07:16.510> label<00:07:18.300> with<00:07:19.300> the<00:07:19.449> name<00:07:19.660> on<00:07:19.840> it

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:19.960 
so there's the label with the name on it
