the<00:00:13.730> dinger<00:00:14.360> look<00:00:14.629> like<00:00:14.929> in<00:00:15.200> a<00:00:15.379> cadion

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:16.330

remember<00:00:17.330> in<00:00:17.920> Sumerian<00:00:19.090> we<00:00:20.090> had<00:00:20.390> it<00:00:21.050> looking<00:00:21.920> a

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.130 
remember in Sumerian we had it looking a

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.689 
remember in Sumerian we had it looking a
lot<00:00:22.550> like<00:00:22.609> an<00:00:23.150> asterisk<00:00:24.039> that<00:00:25.039> was<00:00:25.279> what<00:00:25.550> was

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:25.699 
lot like an asterisk that was what was

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:31.630 
lot like an asterisk that was what was
known<00:00:26.000> as<00:00:26.330> the<00:00:26.779> dinger<00:00:27.640> or<00:00:28.640> on<00:00:30.310> which<00:00:31.310> means

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
known as the dinger or on which means

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.130 
known as the dinger or on which means
God<00:00:33.070> and<00:00:34.070> a<00:00:34.879> cadion<00:00:35.390> it's<00:00:35.600> a<00:00:35.719> little<00:00:36.020> bit

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
God and a cadion it's a little bit

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.790 
God and a cadion it's a little bit
different<00:00:36.590> when<00:00:36.800> it<00:00:36.920> evolved<00:00:37.899> when<00:00:38.899> King

little bit short Newton we have more

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:49.240 
little bit short Newton we have more
efficient<00:00:47.809> way<00:00:48.050> of<00:00:48.260> representing<00:00:49.039> it<00:00:49.190> as

China<00:00:49.789> still<00:00:50.210> looks<00:00:50.480> like<00:00:50.600> a<00:00:50.750> star<00:00:51.440> and<00:00:52.340> this

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
China still looks like a star and this

00:00:52.670 --> 00:01:05.830 
China still looks like a star and this
was<00:00:53.420> known<00:00:53.750> as<00:00:55.000> on<00:00:56.260> in<00:00:57.260> a<00:00:57.710> cadion

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.020 

we're<00:01:06.470> now<00:01:06.590> gonna<00:01:06.829> attempt<00:01:07.340> the<00:01:07.520> second

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
we're now gonna attempt the second

symbol<00:01:09.040> another<00:01:10.040> symbol<00:01:10.490> called<00:01:10.850> the<00:01:11.270> zoo<00:01:11.710> the

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
symbol another symbol called the zoo the

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.539 
symbol another symbol called the zoo the
zoo<00:01:12.740> looks<00:01:13.310> a<00:01:13.430> little<00:01:13.549> bit<00:01:13.820> like<00:01:13.970> the<00:01:14.149> BA<00:01:15.549> these

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
zoo looks a little bit like the BA these

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:20.830 
zoo looks a little bit like the BA these
strokes<00:01:16.970> are<00:01:17.360> very<00:01:17.390> similar<00:01:18.079> and<00:01:19.119> dense<00:01:20.119> put

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
strokes are very similar and dense put

strokes are very similar and dense put
another<00:01:21.049> wedge<00:01:21.320> stroke<00:01:21.680> coming<00:01:22.039> across<00:01:22.280> and

another wedge stroke coming across and

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:25.270 
another wedge stroke coming across and
the<00:01:23.929> only<00:01:24.289> difference<00:01:24.710> is<00:01:24.890> that<00:01:24.920> there's

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
the only difference is that there's

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.950 
the only difference is that there's
another<00:01:25.520> parallel<00:01:26.000> wedge<00:01:26.360> stroke<00:01:26.659> coming

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
another parallel wedge stroke coming

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:33.340 
another parallel wedge stroke coming
down<00:01:27.670> so<00:01:28.670> that<00:01:28.909> is<00:01:29.240> pronounced<00:01:29.990> zoo<00:01:31.509> now<00:01:32.509> what

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
down so that is pronounced zoo now what

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.600 
down so that is pronounced zoo now what
the<00:01:33.679> zoo<00:01:33.950> I<00:01:34.869> happen<00:01:35.869> to<00:01:35.899> be<00:01:36.079> in<00:01:36.289> what<00:01:37.280> happens

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
the zoo I happen to be in what happens

to be in the Akkadian word spider and
the<00:01:42.679> way<00:01:42.830> you<00:01:42.890> would<00:01:43.220> write<00:01:43.399> that<00:01:43.670> is<00:01:44.090> to<00:01:44.750> first

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
the way you would write that is to first

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:50.230 
the way you would write that is to first
write<00:01:45.560> the<00:01:45.830> dinger<00:01:46.450> which<00:01:47.450> looks<00:01:47.990> like<00:01:48.590> this<00:01:49.240> -

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
write the dinger which looks like this -

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.350 
write the dinger which looks like this -
short<00:01:50.750> wedge<00:01:51.259> strokes<00:01:51.799> with<00:01:52.459> one<00:01:52.759> coming

short wedge strokes with one coming
straight<00:01:53.689> down<00:01:53.750> that's<00:01:54.560> the<00:01:54.740> dinner<00:01:54.950> or<00:01:56.439> what

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
straight down that's the dinner or what
