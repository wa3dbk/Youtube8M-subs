00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.770
 in the uis amiguis 

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:06.819
 hi my name is dj and this time 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.790
 he wants to teach you how to make a 

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:13.330
 closeup with newspaper but 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:15.519
 decorated with crepe paper here I have a 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.920
 model of how we would stay 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:20.560
 portal portrait I want to teach us 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.810
 it would be something like that the picture is portrayed 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.950
 for a photo of about 15 years that's why 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.350
 of 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.480
 I have chosen the red crepe paper 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:31.180
 and pink and I've decorated it with some 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:35.200
 little flowers in sweet wire as we can 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:37.330
 see here and here then if you like 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.160
 like this one carries the portrait stay 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.580
 watching the video and we see each other 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.580
 next 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.110
 Well, the first thing we are going to do is 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.079
 that we are going to take a cardboard 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:59.130
 and we are going to measure 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.850
 our photography in this way 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:04.710
 and we are going to cut our cardboard 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.570
 approximately one and a half centimeters 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.870
 On each side 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.460
 I mean the photo and half is left 1 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:16.090
 centimeter and a half more cardboard 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:18.600
 let's mark our picture here as 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.600
 we see here 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:27.100
 then we are going to take another cardboard and go 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:27.100
 to measure what we already had about this 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.600
 let us stay 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.570
 two centimeters 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.240
 d 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.700
 bigger than the other and the same goes 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.520
 to do as if for photography we are going 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.399
 to mark it 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:49.290
 at two centimeters let's go back to 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:51.890
 do this same with another cardboard 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:55.810
 make it bigger 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:58.729
 and the same thing that is two centimeters 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.979
 larger than the other that we have left 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.320
 this way like two little steps 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:08.000
 centimeters two centimeters centimeter and 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:11.000
 medium and our photography 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.520
 that we stay like this 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.430
 so now what we are going to do is 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:19.000
 that we are going to stick our three cards 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.730
 in this way 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.710
 for this we are going to use silicone 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.250
 hot 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.250
 I 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.540
 do not 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.650
 juventus had the union 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.549
 and we are left in this way 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.490
 good already having this 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:05.640
 what we are going to do is that we are going to 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:05.640
 need newspaper tubes 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:13.379
 and we will start to paste 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:15.800
 around our portrait portal 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:19.600
 in this way 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.600
 let's put silicone 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.220
 and we are going to paste 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.870
 Now we are going to paste silicones with 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:49.670
 and we are going to make pressure here 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.670
 to bend it and to upload 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:59.540
 Now here we are going to do the same thing 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:03.170
 to cast silicone we make pressure we double 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.170
 and we paste 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:14.550
 here we call silicon we do pressure 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:14.550
 we bend and paste 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:24.390
 here we take silicone 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:27.300
 if we have pressure here forgiveness before 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:30.770
 double what we're going to do is we 're going 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.770
 to take another roll 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:33.360
 Y 

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:39.469
 here in this little hole we are going to put the 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:39.469
 other 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.630
 in this way 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.570
 and so we are going to double 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:55.800
 and we will continue rolling and rolling 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:58.380
 and we are going to follow the same procedure 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:02.090
 when we finish the tip we're going 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.090
 introducing another and we will continue 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:08.880
 bending hitting until we finish 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:12.900
 all the photo frame we finished 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:15.120
 paste our newspaper and we have left 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.850
 this way 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:20.850
 so now what we are going to do is 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:23.520
 We are going to paint it with white tempera 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:25.260
 acrylic so that when you paste 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.810
 our little paper so you do not notice 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:30.750
 then words and letters that has 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:33.000
 our newspaper then we are going to 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:36.890
 start painting 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.890
 all our portrait portal 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.169
 well here we have our portal 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:44.379
 portrait 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:46.870
 is already painted and dry then now what 

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:50.180
 what are we going to do is we are going to cut 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:53.240
 colorful pieces of paper if you want to use 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.820
 napkin some thin paper what 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.230
 let's start in small squares 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:06:01.010
 this time I have split two 

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:03.800
 colors this color as rosadito creampie 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:05.980
 and this green and we will go hitting 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:08.720
 intercalary 

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:12.139
 with a little color 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:14.629
 good so let's go 

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:16.550
 taking on our paper and we're going 

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:19.730
 hitting 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:23.470
 very carefully corner and then 

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:23.470
 we take a little bit of glue 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.169
 and we're sticking it 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:32.930
 marking the lines of the paper very well 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:32.930
 Newspaper 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.930
 in this way 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:43.810
 so and so we go like this we are staying 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:45.340
 in this way then now what 

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:48.990
 let's do 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:53.440
 is that we are going to take a small ribbon 

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:58.169
 let's do it as well as a 

00:06:53.440 --> 00:07:01.630
 nudito and we're going to hit it here back 

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:04.830
 let's see what we have left 

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:04.830
 in the middle 

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:14.050
 and we stick our ribbon 

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:16.180
 that we will be focused now what 

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:18.250
 we're going to do is we're going to cut a 

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:20.680
 Foami paper box and we're going to 

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:25.860
 paste from behind our portal 

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:25.860
 portrait that fits us like this 

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:33.140
 and after having our photo frame 

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:35.420
 already with the paper font and stuck to the back 

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:38.060
 what we are going to do is that we are going to 

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:41.200
 take our picture 

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:41.200
 we are going to put it 

00:07:44.969 --> 00:07:50.339
 and we are going to cut an acetate box 

00:07:47.819 --> 00:07:54.360
 the same size in our photo and it's the 

00:07:50.339 --> 00:07:57.649
 let's put on as protection and 

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:57.649
 we are left this way 

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:03.240
 you can decorate it with the shape 

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:07.620
 that you want 

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:11.310
 it's already in your imagination then 

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:15.800
 this is our portrait portal 

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:15.800
 the hole Ã¡vila
