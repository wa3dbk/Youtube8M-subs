track<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.629> if<00:00:33.629> I<00:00:33.720> was<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:33.989> choose<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.500> race

there<00:00:35.280> again<00:00:35.550> I<00:00:35.840> absolutely<00:00:36.840> love<00:00:37.019> to<00:00:37.170> do<00:00:37.590> that

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
there again I absolutely love to do that

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:48.020 
there again I absolutely love to do that
I<00:00:44.989> think<00:00:45.989> so<00:00:46.199> I<00:00:46.230> mean<00:00:46.440> I<00:00:46.769> started<00:00:47.280> in<00:00:47.430> go-karts

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
I think so I mean I started in go-karts

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.240 
I think so I mean I started in go-karts
quite<00:00:48.449> young<00:00:48.690> age<00:00:48.870> maybe<00:00:49.199> nine<00:00:49.500> years<00:00:49.769> old<00:00:49.979> and

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
quite young age maybe nine years old and

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.710 
quite young age maybe nine years old and
kind<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.330> progressed<00:00:51.750> through<00:00:53.390> and<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.479> guess

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:54.720 
kind of progressed through and I guess

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.149 
kind of progressed through and I guess
it<00:00:54.870> wasn't<00:00:55.019> until<00:00:55.260> I<00:00:55.320> started<00:00:55.530> winning<00:00:55.830> races

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:56.159 
it wasn't until I started winning races

00:00:56.159 --> 00:00:58.310 
it wasn't until I started winning races
I<00:00:56.370> realized<00:00:57.239> that<00:00:57.390> there<00:00:57.570> was<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.690> chance<00:00:57.989> of

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
I realized that there was a chance of

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.410 
I realized that there was a chance of
maybe<00:00:59.159> progressing<00:00:59.879> on<00:01:00.000> forward<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:01.339> guess

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
maybe progressing on forward and I guess

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.820 
maybe progressing on forward and I guess
halfway<00:01:03.420> through<00:01:03.869> my<00:01:03.930> career<00:01:04.049> in<00:01:04.379> carts<00:01:04.710> I

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
halfway through my career in carts I

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.910 
halfway through my career in carts I
realized<00:01:05.250> that<00:01:06.020> the<00:01:07.020> chance<00:01:07.320> was<00:01:07.530> there<00:01:07.740> to

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
realized that the chance was there to

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.590 
realized that the chance was there to
progress<00:01:08.220> forward<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.650> in<00:01:10.650> 2008<00:01:11.640> i<00:01:11.670> was<00:01:12.030> given

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
progress forward and in 2008 i was given

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.840 
progress forward and in 2008 i was given
or<00:01:13.020> rewarded<00:01:13.770> my<00:01:13.920> first<00:01:14.189> drive<00:01:14.520> in<00:01:14.700> single

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
or rewarded my first drive in single

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.160 
or rewarded my first drive in single
seaters<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.540> I<00:01:15.600> guess<00:01:16.400> 2007<00:01:17.400> was<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.580> year<00:01:17.820> I

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
seaters and I guess 2007 was a year I

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.540 
seaters and I guess 2007 was a year I
realized<00:01:19.170> things<00:01:19.710> were<00:01:19.920> happening<00:01:20.070> things

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:20.550 
realized things were happening things

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.690 
realized things were happening things
are<00:01:20.700> possible<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:22.010> yeah<00:01:23.010> it<00:01:23.190> just<00:01:23.220> progressed

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
are possible and yeah it just progressed

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:30.690 
are possible and yeah it just progressed
from<00:01:23.820> there<00:01:23.910> really

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.520 

yeah<00:01:31.700> I<00:01:31.729> mean<00:01:32.120> I<00:01:32.750> find<00:01:33.020> it<00:01:33.140> strange<00:01:33.229> when

something<00:02:12.950> I'll<00:02:13.070> always<00:02:13.100> remember

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
something I'll always remember

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:23.800 
something I'll always remember
definitely<00:02:20.320> and<00:02:21.320> not<00:02:22.100> so<00:02:22.640> much<00:02:22.700> i<00:02:23.180> mean<00:02:23.360> the

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
definitely and not so much i mean the

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.240 
definitely and not so much i mean the
formula<00:02:24.230> 1<00:02:24.380> and<00:02:24.560> the<00:02:24.620> GP<00:02:24.920> two<00:02:25.040> are<00:02:25.220> very

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
formula 1 and the GP two are very

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.229 
formula 1 and the GP two are very
different<00:02:25.489> cars<00:02:26.890> physically<00:02:27.890> you<00:02:28.130> feel<00:02:28.400> the

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
different cars physically you feel the

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:30.880 
different cars physically you feel the
effect<00:02:29.630> in<00:02:29.810> different<00:02:30.110> muscles<00:02:30.470> I<00:02:30.620> think<00:02:30.830> in

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
effect in different muscles I think in

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.310 
effect in different muscles I think in
the<00:02:30.980> formula<00:02:31.370> one<00:02:31.489> especially<00:02:31.790> is<00:02:32.150> it's<00:02:32.630> much

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
the formula one especially is it's much

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.650 
the formula one especially is it's much
more<00:02:33.940> physical<00:02:34.940> on<00:02:35.329> your<00:02:35.450> neck<00:02:35.630> muscles

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
more physical on your neck muscles

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.020 
more physical on your neck muscles
purely<00:02:36.440> because<00:02:36.590> of<00:02:36.739> more<00:02:37.010> g-force<00:02:37.579> more

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
purely because of more g-force more

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.740 
purely because of more g-force more
corner<00:02:38.450> speeds<00:02:39.160> I<00:02:40.160> think<00:02:40.940> the<00:02:41.120> the<00:02:41.360> hardest

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
corner speeds I think the the hardest

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.660 
corner speeds I think the the hardest
task<00:02:42.110> for<00:02:42.470> me<00:02:42.590> was<00:02:42.769> mentally<00:02:43.250> preparing

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
task for me was mentally preparing

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.229 
task for me was mentally preparing
mentally<00:02:44.230> visualizing<00:02:45.760> going<00:02:46.760> back<00:02:46.970> into<00:02:47.150> the

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
mentally visualizing going back into the

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.210 
mentally visualizing going back into the
gp2<00:02:47.690> because<00:02:48.260> they're<00:02:48.410> a<00:02:48.440> good<00:02:48.680> eight<00:02:48.860> to<00:02:49.010> ten

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
gp2 because they're a good eight to ten

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.920 
gp2 because they're a good eight to ten
seconds<00:02:49.730> off<00:02:49.820> the<00:02:49.850> pace<00:02:49.970> of<00:02:50.360> the<00:02:50.420> Formula<00:02:50.780> One

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
seconds off the pace of the Formula One

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.340 
seconds off the pace of the Formula One
car<00:02:50.959> and<00:02:51.880> I<00:02:52.880> just<00:02:53.450> needed<00:02:53.780> a<00:02:53.840> good<00:02:54.049> ten<00:02:54.320> minutes

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
car and I just needed a good ten minutes

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.490 
car and I just needed a good ten minutes
of<00:02:54.920> thinking<00:02:55.640> through<00:02:55.910> a<00:02:56.239> lap<00:02:56.780> and<00:02:56.930> a<00:02:57.019> GP<00:02:57.350> to

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
of thinking through a lap and a GP to

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.710 
of thinking through a lap and a GP to
cart<00:02:57.860> because<00:02:58.070> obviously<00:02:58.370> like<00:02:59.239> I<00:02:59.269> said<00:02:59.570> the

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
cart because obviously like I said the

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.500 
cart because obviously like I said the
breakpoints<00:03:00.290> are<00:03:00.380> completely<00:03:00.860> different<00:03:01.510> and

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
breakpoints are completely different and

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:03.880 
breakpoints are completely different and
that<00:03:02.660> was<00:03:02.780> the<00:03:02.870> biggest<00:03:03.079> thing<00:03:03.260> to<00:03:03.350> adapt<00:03:03.650> to

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
that was the biggest thing to adapt to

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.220 
that was the biggest thing to adapt to
but<00:03:04.160> actually<00:03:05.090> I<00:03:05.120> surprised<00:03:05.600> how<00:03:05.840> well<00:03:06.049> it

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
but actually I surprised how well it

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.620 
but actually I surprised how well it
went<00:03:06.380> I<00:03:06.620> was<00:03:06.860> able<00:03:07.010> to<00:03:07.250> jump<00:03:08.030> out<00:03:08.180> the<00:03:08.329> formula

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
went I was able to jump out the formula

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.720 
went I was able to jump out the formula
one<00:03:08.870> jump<00:03:09.230> in<00:03:09.350> the<00:03:09.440> gb<00:03:09.769> tomb<00:03:09.950> within<00:03:10.280> two<00:03:10.459> laps

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
one jump in the gb tomb within two laps

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.430 
one jump in the gb tomb within two laps
I<00:03:11.920> was<00:03:12.920> put<00:03:13.190> ours<00:03:13.459> on<00:03:13.489> the<00:03:13.579> pace<00:03:13.820> so<00:03:14.320> it<00:03:15.320> gives

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
I was put ours on the pace so it gives

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.009 
I was put ours on the pace so it gives
me<00:03:15.620> confidence<00:03:15.799> going<00:03:16.370> forward<00:03:16.489> for<00:03:17.180> for<00:03:17.930> the

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
me confidence going forward for for the

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:25.830 
me confidence going forward for for the
upcoming<00:03:18.350> free<00:03:18.709> practice<00:03:18.890> sessions

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.839 

it's<00:03:26.840> a<00:03:26.930> big<00:03:27.170> jump<00:03:27.439> like<00:03:27.739> I<00:03:27.890> said<00:03:27.950> I<00:03:28.219> think

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:28.849 
it's a big jump like I said I think

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:31.720 
it's a big jump like I said I think
getting<00:03:29.209> out<00:03:29.420> there<00:03:29.719> on<00:03:30.409> track<00:03:31.189> before<00:03:31.400> the

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
getting out there on track before the

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.030 
getting out there on track before the
gp2<00:03:32.060> of<00:03:32.450> course<00:03:32.750> is<00:03:32.900> an<00:03:33.019> advantage<00:03:33.379> if<00:03:33.859> there's

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
gp2 of course is an advantage if there's

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.910 
gp2 of course is an advantage if there's
any<00:03:34.159> track<00:03:34.489> changes<00:03:35.349> which<00:03:36.349> it<00:03:36.379> tends<00:03:36.739> to<00:03:36.829> be

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
any track changes which it tends to be

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.550 
any track changes which it tends to be
from<00:03:37.280> year<00:03:37.459> to<00:03:37.519> year<00:03:37.640> so<00:03:38.230> just<00:03:39.230> to<00:03:39.290> be<00:03:39.349> able<00:03:39.439> to

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
from year to year so just to be able to

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:40.809 
from year to year so just to be able to
get<00:03:39.680> a<00:03:39.709> few<00:03:39.920> laps<00:03:40.159> under<00:03:40.340> my<00:03:40.519> belt<00:03:40.730> before

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819 
get a few laps under my belt before

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:43.770 
get a few laps under my belt before
jumping<00:03:41.329> in<00:03:41.569> the<00:03:41.659> gb<00:03:41.930> to<00:03:42.079> is<00:03:42.230> certainly

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
jumping in the gb to is certainly

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:52.410 
jumping in the gb to is certainly
certainly<00:03:44.780> helpful<00:03:45.170> that's<00:03:45.469> for<00:03:45.650> sure<00:03:45.769> I

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.940

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
course it's emotional is such a big

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:21.550 
course it's emotional is such a big
thing<00:04:19.639> there's<00:04:20.209> so<00:04:20.389> many<00:04:20.479> people<00:04:20.810> around<00:04:21.139> in

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
the team and it's just just huge but as

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.850 
the team and it's just just huge but as
times<00:04:26.210> gone<00:04:26.479> on<00:04:26.539> as<00:04:26.900> I've<00:04:27.020> integrated<00:04:27.289> with

times gone on as I've integrated with
sahara<00:04:28.789> force<00:04:29.090> india<00:04:29.510> i<00:04:29.539> think<00:04:29.870> it's<00:04:30.080> just

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
sahara force india i think it's just

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:36.650 
sahara force india i think it's just
become<00:04:30.590> more<00:04:30.800> natural

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.480 

it's<00:04:37.660> a<00:04:37.720> good<00:04:37.870> question<00:04:38.070> it's<00:04:39.070> hard<00:04:39.220> to<00:04:39.280> answer

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
it's a good question it's hard to answer

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.960 
it's a good question it's hard to answer
because<00:04:40.710> from<00:04:41.710> an<00:04:41.860> early<00:04:42.100> age<00:04:42.130> had<00:04:42.460> just<00:04:42.880> been
