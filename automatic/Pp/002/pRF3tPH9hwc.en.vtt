and<00:00:59.039> it's<00:00:59.370> ready<00:00:59.699> all<00:00:59.969> we<00:01:00.390> need<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.719> do<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:01.140> stir

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
and it's ready all we need to do is stir

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.850 
and it's ready all we need to do is stir
in<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.680> coconut<00:01:02.930> you<00:01:03.930> want<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.199> stir<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.680> mix

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
in the coconut you want to stir and mix

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.080 
in the coconut you want to stir and mix
this<00:01:05.129> until<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.939> is<00:01:05.970> very<00:01:06.780> evenly<00:01:07.439> blended<00:01:08.159> the

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
this until it is very evenly blended the

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.570 
this until it is very evenly blended the
next<00:01:09.420> step<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:10.159> to<00:01:11.159> drop<00:01:11.549> this<00:01:11.939> into<00:01:12.979> 12<00:01:13.979> even

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
next step is to drop this into 12 even

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.130 
next step is to drop this into 12 even
size<00:01:14.880> mounds<00:01:15.509> on<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.049> wax<00:01:16.530> paper<00:01:16.860> line<00:01:17.369> tray<00:01:17.759> I

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
size mounds on a wax paper line tray I

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.170 
size mounds on a wax paper line tray I
think<00:01:19.140> these<00:01:19.259> are<00:01:19.320> pretty<00:01:19.650> even<00:01:20.040> now<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.729> so

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
think these are pretty even now and so

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.700 
think these are pretty even now and so
what<00:01:21.360> I'll<00:01:21.479> do<00:01:21.780> now<00:01:22.080> is<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:24.200> use<00:01:25.939> wet<00:01:26.939> fingers

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
what I'll do now is to use wet fingers

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.740 
what I'll do now is to use wet fingers
and<00:01:28.710> you're<00:01:28.860> going<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.189> shape<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:29.880> mold<00:01:29.909> your

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
and you're going to shape and mold your

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.170 
and you're going to shape and mold your
little<00:01:31.740> nest<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.759> reason<00:01:33.090> you're

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
little nest and the reason you're

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.179 
little nest and the reason you're
wetting<00:01:33.420> your<00:01:33.630> fingers<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:34.320> so<00:01:34.829> that<00:01:35.040> the

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
wetting your fingers is so that the

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.560 
wetting your fingers is so that the
coconut<00:01:35.460> mixture<00:01:35.820> doesn't<00:01:36.270> stick<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:37.049> them<00:01:38.570> so

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
coconut mixture doesn't stick to them so

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.719 
coconut mixture doesn't stick to them so
these<00:01:39.720> are<00:01:39.869> ready<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.320> go<00:01:40.500> all<00:01:40.829> you<00:01:41.159> need<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.520> do

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
is give them a few hours to air dry so

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.830 
is give them a few hours to air dry so
that<00:01:44.430> they're<00:01:44.579> firm<00:01:44.850> enough<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.360> hold<00:01:45.509> your
