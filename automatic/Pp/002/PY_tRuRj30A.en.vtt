00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.620
 striped managed 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:14.780
 this is a pedestrian crossing 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:17.760
 signs zebra everything is in place you can go 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:22.230
 just be careful how are we this thing not you 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:26.189
 kicked out because of what often dies 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.470
 pedestrians that you can learn by heart to 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.509
 survive on the wilds and when compliance 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.509
 rules do not guarantee safety 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.330
 these shocking shots are very similar friend 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.210
 on friend 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:43.460
 one car skips going on a zebra 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:49.460
 pedestrian but the driver in the next row 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:50.800
 not even going to slow down by 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.060
 rules if before unregulated 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.950
 crossing adjacent rows begin 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.380
 to brake cars drivers of others 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.450
 machines should slow down and even 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.210
 stop and continue moving 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.170
 can only make sure that the transition 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.560
 no pedestrians 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.750
 but the reality is more severe these pedestrians 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:13.729
 hoped they would miss 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:16.220
 and so boldly stepped forward pedestrians 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:18.530
 moving in an unspecified place outside the zone 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.150
 crosswalk goes to 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.240
 red traffic signal 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.940
 and why be afraid of a fine of only 200 rubles 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.430
 even if green is on, see 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:33.369
 the sides and the grandson over the drivers decide 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.369
 slip yellow or red 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.950
 attentive war 

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:40.960
 country hotel, remember that the driver can 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:45.030
 and do not know what is ahead of the transition 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:47.710
 look winter games are almost not visible on 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.920
 the infamous transition in Bryansk 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:54.250
 There were no zebras at all, but two signs 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.979
 laid on the guest was only one with 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.189
 right side of the road and it closed in 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:59.189
 Tom 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:05.390
 who is to blame the police road builders whether you 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.330
 yourself after death you will not care 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:17.180
 so before you step on the roadway 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:18.020
 protect yourself and loved ones by 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.430
 statistics 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.370
 peak crashes involving pedestrians 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:25.460
 accounted for at night therefore 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:29.390
 your clothes should be noticeable even in 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:31.940
 the darkness beyond the borders have long understood 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:35.740
 you want you don't want such a pedestrian 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.740
 notice is simply impossible 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:40.549
 Adults on the jacket can be hung 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:42.709
 kopeeshny color returning stickers 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:43.640
 strips can be bought for about 30 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.420
 rubles per meter 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:51.170
 in all fabric stores sew and 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:52.790
 forward this driver reacted too 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.579
 late he began to slow down 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:58.790
 I realized that I do not have time and traveled by a pedestrian 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:01.420
 0 weight or the driver slowed down in advance 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.159
 but the car would be priced 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.980
 if you have a baby before you go 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:08.829
 the street take his hand better like this 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.840
 not for mitten 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:14.510
 otherwise he will be able to escape while on the road 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.760
 deadly to walk and must 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.159
 understand that a pedestrian can jump out 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.500
 from anywhere and be ready for it 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:23.750
 sure sign if the cars are in the next 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.870
 row or in front of you slow down means 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.750
 the pedestrian is already on the crossing and in a second 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.709
 he would be in front of your hood 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.709
 stop 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:41.290
 but more often the drivers do this if 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.980
 the man in front of you and you do not brake 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.590
 have time 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.050
 try to go around it you need to go around 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.090
 know if you try to overtake the front 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:51.760
 panic pedestrian may rush right to you 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.290
 I repeat, even if they miss 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.450
 relax early 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.930
 take a look at the river to brake before 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:01.209
 crossing over and then beating him from behind 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.810
 pedestrians barely dodged but similar 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:04.390
 situation 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.760
 elena kisuli on sitting behind the wheel of this 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:10.000
 cars do not regret for a second that 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.770
 slowed down the transition because hitting 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.840
 on a pedestrian much heavier 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.840
 the consequences of a sword there is a broken car 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:23.510
 they let us reach the middle 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:26.320
 and now how we teach the school we look to the right 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.320
 purely 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:33.509
 take a look at the exit rules 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:36.630
 the band is prohibited but the violator is not 

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:39.150
 stops such situations alas not 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.720
 rare and need to be able to provide and 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.530
 such a 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:45.539
 and do not be lazy every time crossing the road 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:48.509
 explain to the kid these simple rules 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:51.360
 let him learn how to do it safely 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:54.050
 even when he grows up this skill more than once 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.050
 he will come in handy
