00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.950 

it's<00:00:13.980> a<00:00:14.040> weird<00:00:14.310> one<00:00:14.520> I<00:00:14.790> was<00:00:15.000> thinking<00:00:15.360> are<00:00:15.780> they

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
it's a weird one I was thinking are they

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.500 
it's a weird one I was thinking are they
chaleur<00:00:16.500> because<00:00:16.830> everybody<00:00:17.160> died<00:00:17.430> ah<00:00:17.940> and

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
chaleur because everybody died ah and

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.870 
chaleur because everybody died ah and
then<00:00:19.380> I<00:00:19.410> realized<00:00:19.800> that<00:00:19.890> it<00:00:20.010> was<00:00:20.160> kind<00:00:20.670> of<00:00:20.730> the

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
then I realized that it was kind of the

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.580 
then I realized that it was kind of the
same<00:00:21.090> movie<00:00:21.720> but<00:00:21.930> from<00:00:22.200> a<00:00:22.380> different

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
same movie but from a different

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.220 
same movie but from a different
perspective<00:00:22.880> so<00:00:23.880> it's<00:00:24.689> like<00:00:24.930> kind<00:00:24.960> of

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
perspective so it's like kind of

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.080 
perspective so it's like kind of
flipping<00:00:25.950> the<00:00:26.130> ball<00:00:26.279> over<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:26.820> you're<00:00:26.939> like

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
flipping the ball over and you're like

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.089 
flipping the ball over and you're like
oh<00:00:27.240> ok<00:00:27.660> now<00:00:27.810> we're<00:00:27.960> standing<00:00:28.140> here<00:00:28.320> on<00:00:28.950> the

oh ok now we're standing here on the
globe<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.520> looking<00:00:30.210> at<00:00:30.300> it<00:00:30.329> from<00:00:30.509> this<00:00:30.779> way

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:31.020

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
and you see these crazy sea battles that

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.139 
and you see these crazy sea battles that
we<00:00:34.680> didn't<00:00:34.890> see<00:00:35.010> in<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.160> first<00:00:35.370> one<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:35.790> also

Leonidas

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:53.700 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.580 

it's<00:00:54.700> a<00:00:54.790> little<00:00:55.030> weird<00:00:55.210> to<00:00:55.570> know<00:00:56.230> it<00:00:56.440> because

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:56.590 
it's a little weird to know it because

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.260 
it's a little weird to know it because
they<00:00:56.710> kind<00:00:56.950> of<00:00:56.980> they<00:00:57.040> build<00:00:57.370> a<00:00:57.670> like<00:00:57.820> a<00:00:57.850> half<00:00:58.150> a

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:58.270 
they kind of they build a like a half a

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.960 
they kind of they build a like a half a
ship<00:00:58.510> which<00:00:58.720> is<00:00:58.870> huge<00:00:59.350> unlike<00:01:00.309> these<00:01:00.460> Gimbels

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:00.970 
ship which is huge unlike these Gimbels

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.420 
ship which is huge unlike these Gimbels
so<00:01:01.300> you're<00:01:01.420> kind<00:01:01.600> of<00:01:01.690> moving<00:01:02.020> around<00:01:02.440> and<00:01:02.770> then

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
so you're kind of moving around and then

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.180 
so you're kind of moving around and then
tons<00:01:04.180> of<00:01:04.390> wind<00:01:04.570> machines<00:01:04.930> so<00:01:05.890> you<00:01:05.950> have

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.190 
tons of wind machines so you have

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:07.830 
tons of wind machines so you have
something<00:01:06.430> that's<00:01:06.550> your<00:01:06.940> kind<00:01:07.150> of<00:01:07.240> pushing

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
something that's your kind of pushing

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.410 
something that's your kind of pushing

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
against a little bit and then also you

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.210 
against a little bit and then also you
have<00:01:10.690> you<00:01:10.840> know<00:01:10.990> the<00:01:11.380> the<00:01:11.619> painters<00:01:12.009> in<00:01:12.040> the

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
background with the cigarettes on their

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:15.180 
background with the cigarettes on their
iPhone<00:01:13.810> so<00:01:14.050> that<00:01:14.229> was<00:01:14.410> like<00:01:14.440> you<00:01:14.830> have<00:01:14.979> this
