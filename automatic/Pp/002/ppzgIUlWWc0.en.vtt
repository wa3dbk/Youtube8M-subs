I guess external microphone for their
new<00:00:15.809> cameras<00:00:16.850> third<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:18.090> D<00:00:18.240> 3100<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.410> 5100

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
new cameras third the D 3100 the 5100

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.750 
new cameras third the D 3100 the 5100
and<00:00:20.520> also<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.180> D<00:00:21.330> 7000<00:00:22.109> all<00:00:22.260> have<00:00:25.189> video<00:00:26.189> so

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
and also to D 7000 all have video so

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.099 
and also to D 7000 all have video so
obviously<00:00:27.090> with<00:00:27.269> video<00:00:27.539> you're<00:00:27.720> also<00:00:27.869> gonna

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
obviously with video you're also gonna

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.990 
obviously with video you're also gonna
want<00:00:28.380> some<00:00:29.250> better<00:00:29.429> audio<00:00:30.199> the<00:00:31.399> 5100<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.550> also

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
want some better audio the 5100 and also

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.660 
want some better audio the 5100 and also
these<00:00:33.290> 7000<00:00:34.290> all<00:00:34.559> both<00:00:34.860> have<00:00:35.100> external

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
these 7000 all both have external

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.030 
these 7000 all both have external
microphone<00:00:36.090> ports<00:00:36.420> so<00:00:37.290> we<00:00:37.500> will<00:00:37.680> be<00:00:37.829> able<00:00:37.890> to

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
microphone ports so we will be able to

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.000 
microphone ports so we will be able to
go<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.430> use<00:00:38.640> this<00:00:38.940> external<00:00:39.300> microphone<00:00:40.010> to

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
go and use this external microphone to

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.560 
go and use this external microphone to
better<00:00:41.219> our<00:00:41.430> audio<00:00:41.790> as<00:00:41.969> far<00:00:42.149> as<00:00:42.270> getting<00:00:42.420> a

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
better our audio as far as getting a

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.940 
better our audio as far as getting a
little<00:00:42.690> bit<00:00:42.840> farther<00:00:43.079> having<00:00:43.620> just<00:00:43.770> better

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
little bit farther having just better

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.610 
little bit farther having just better
audio<00:00:44.280> quality<00:00:44.550> as<00:00:44.910> well<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:46.079> directional

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
audio quality as well the directional

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.660 
audio quality as well the directional
mic<00:00:46.800> on<00:00:47.010> here<00:00:47.550> is<00:00:48.559> a<00:00:49.559> little<00:00:49.890> bit<00:00:50.100> smaller<00:00:50.430> than

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
mic on here is a little bit smaller than

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.490 
mic on here is a little bit smaller than
we've<00:00:50.879> seen<00:00:50.910> on<00:00:51.329> let's<00:00:51.570> say<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.809> ads<00:00:51.989> in<00:00:52.230> model

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
we've seen on let's say the ads in model

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.740 
we've seen on let's say the ads in model
that<00:00:52.620> we<00:00:52.710> saw<00:00:52.860> before<00:00:53.180> just<00:00:54.180> have<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.539> boom

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
that we saw before just have the boom

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.979 
that we saw before just have the boom
cover<00:00:55.050> so<00:00:55.379> we<00:00:55.500> can<00:00:55.649> actually<00:00:55.800> soften<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.989> on

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
cover so we can actually soften that on

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.990 
cover so we can actually soften that on
the<00:00:58.379> back<00:00:58.559> here<00:00:58.949> you<00:00:59.129> do<00:00:59.280> also<00:00:59.460> have<00:00:59.579> a

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
the back here you do also have a

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.319 
the back here you do also have a
selector<00:01:00.660> for<00:01:01.100> low-cut<00:01:02.100> so<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:03.000> could<00:01:03.180> get

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
selector for low-cut so you could get

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.270 
selector for low-cut so you could get
rid<00:01:03.449> of<00:01:03.480> lighting<00:01:03.780> background<00:01:04.110> noises<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.710> we

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
rid of lighting background noises and we

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.800 
rid of lighting background noises and we
have<00:01:05.460> flat<00:01:05.729> so<00:01:05.970> we<00:01:06.030> could<00:01:06.210> just<00:01:06.330> flatten<00:01:06.689> out

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
have flat so we could just flatten out

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.770 
have flat so we could just flatten out
the<00:01:07.909> audio<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:09.090> we're<00:01:09.210> getting<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.570> really

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
the audio that we're getting and really

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.679 
the audio that we're getting and really
just<00:01:09.990> get<00:01:10.140> all<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.650> audio<00:01:10.950> quality<00:01:11.100> there<00:01:11.689> it

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
just get all the audio quality there it

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.609 
just get all the audio quality there it
does<00:01:12.960> have<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.260> standard<00:01:14.060> 3.5<00:01:15.619> millimeter

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
does have a standard 3.5 millimeter

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.620 
does have a standard 3.5 millimeter
headphone<00:01:16.680> jack<00:01:17.280> so<00:01:17.520> we<00:01:18.150> don't<00:01:18.299> have<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.479> worry

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
headphone jack so we don't have to worry

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.450 
headphone jack so we don't have to worry
about<00:01:18.750> possibly<00:01:19.259> using<00:01:19.590> this<00:01:19.680> with<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:19.950> canning

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
about possibly using this with a canning

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.330 
about possibly using this with a canning
or<00:01:21.350> panasonic<00:01:22.350> v<00:01:22.530> like<00:01:22.770> that<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.070> might<00:01:23.220> need

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
or panasonic v like that you might need

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.660 
or panasonic v like that you might need
an<00:01:23.460> adapter<00:01:23.970> but<00:01:24.150> it's<00:01:24.509> really<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.810> standard

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
an adapter but it's really a standard

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.910 
an adapter but it's really a standard
connection<00:01:26.670> so<00:01:26.880> we<00:01:26.909> have<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.299> worry<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.930> it

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
connection so we have to worry and it

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.460 
connection so we have to worry and it
will<00:01:29.070> tilt<00:01:29.460> so<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:29.909> can<00:01:30.030> actually<00:01:30.119> get

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
will tilt so you can actually get

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.859 
will tilt so you can actually get
different<00:01:31.470> angles<00:01:31.770> of<00:01:32.180> the<00:01:33.180> audio<00:01:33.479> so<00:01:33.570> if<00:01:33.750> you

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
different angles of the audio so if you

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.499 
different angles of the audio so if you
wanna<00:01:34.020> get<00:01:34.259> something<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:34.950> little<00:01:35.100> bit<00:01:35.189> more

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
wanna get something a little bit more

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:37.460 
wanna get something a little bit more
listen<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.630> yourself<00:01:36.960> or<00:01:37.200> something<00:01:37.409> like

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
listen to yourself or something like

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
that or maybe something a little bit

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.760 
that or maybe something a little bit
higher<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:39.119> can<00:01:39.689> do<00:01:39.840> so<00:01:40.020> with<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.229> directional

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
higher you can do so with a directional

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:41.920 
higher you can do so with a directional
mic

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930
