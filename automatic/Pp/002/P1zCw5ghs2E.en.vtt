one because naming it
sharknado<00:02:13.900> 2<00:02:14.170> does<00:02:14.650> not<00:02:14.680> indicate<00:02:15.130> that<00:02:15.370> it's

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
advocate of how funny this movie was

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:21.870

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
sharks in the tornado and I think that's

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.660 
sharks in the tornado and I think that's
how<00:03:24.730> they<00:03:24.880> got<00:03:25.030> so<00:03:25.240> popular<00:03:26.070> because<00:03:27.070> he<00:03:27.490> was
