arms out and collapse the head down and

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:14.869 
arms out and collapse the head down and
they'll<00:02:07.229> snap<00:02:07.649> into<00:02:07.800> place<00:02:08.009> right<00:02:08.310> there<00:02:13.879> and

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
they'll snap into place right there and

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.820 
they'll snap into place right there and
there's<00:02:15.150> mindset<00:02:15.870> doesn't<00:02:16.379> look<00:02:16.530> a<00:02:16.560> whole<00:02:16.800> lot

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
there's mindset doesn't look a whole lot

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.699 
there's mindset doesn't look a whole lot
like<00:02:17.069> aside<00:02:17.580> from<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:18.080> slightly<00:02:19.080> bluish<00:02:19.410> car

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
like aside from the slightly bluish car

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.080 
like aside from the slightly bluish car
and<00:02:19.860> even<00:02:19.920> then<00:02:20.129> I<00:02:20.160> think<00:02:20.220> mindset<00:02:20.849> and<00:02:21.000> that

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
and even then I think mindset and that

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.550 
and even then I think mindset and that
g2<00:02:21.450> comic<00:02:21.750> was<00:02:21.840> a<00:02:21.870> little<00:02:22.019> bit<00:02:22.109> greener<00:02:22.379> than

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
g2 comic was a little bit greener than

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.530 
g2 comic was a little bit greener than
this<00:02:23.030> but<00:02:24.030> there's<00:02:24.599> mindset<00:02:25.489> in<00:02:26.489> robot<00:02:26.939> mode

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
this but there's mindset in robot mode

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.539 
this but there's mindset in robot mode
to<00:02:28.409> be<00:02:28.500> a<00:02:28.530> little<00:02:28.620> difficult<00:02:28.860> to<00:02:29.099> stand<00:02:29.340> with

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
to be a little difficult to stand with

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:32.360 
to be a little difficult to stand with
the<00:02:29.640> backpack<00:02:30.890> especially<00:02:31.890> fold<00:02:32.099> it<00:02:32.219> down

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
the backpack especially fold it down

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.670 
the backpack especially fold it down
like<00:02:32.400> that<00:02:32.549> no<00:02:32.879> official<00:02:33.780> transformation<00:02:34.590> you

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
like that no official transformation you

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.220 
like that no official transformation you
want<00:02:34.829> to<00:02:34.890> rotate<00:02:35.129> the<00:02:35.340> backpack<00:02:35.730> around<00:02:36.230> open

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
want to rotate the backpack around open

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.599 
want to rotate the backpack around open
it<00:02:37.319> up<00:02:37.549> and<00:02:38.549> then<00:02:39.019> lift<00:02:40.019> these<00:02:40.290> up<00:02:40.370> like<00:02:41.370> this

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:41.609 
it up and then lift these up like this

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:46.160 
it up and then lift these up like this
and<00:02:42.530> then<00:02:43.530> fold<00:02:44.189> them<00:02:44.370> up<00:02:44.519> and<00:02:44.700> around<00:02:45.170> and

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
and then fold them up and around and

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.780 
and then fold them up and around and
then<00:02:47.069> so<00:02:47.340> they<00:02:47.459> each<00:02:47.609> peg<00:02:47.939> on<00:02:49.489> to<00:02:50.489> each<00:02:50.670> of

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
then so they each peg on to each of

00:02:50.790 --> 00:03:00.849

I<00:03:14.489> do<00:03:14.549> with<00:03:14.730> hailstorm<00:03:15.239> and<00:03:15.419> then<00:03:15.900> just<00:03:16.109> as<00:03:16.260> a

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
I do with hailstorm and then just as a

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.309 
I do with hailstorm and then just as a
quick<00:03:16.560> comparison<00:03:16.769> between<00:03:17.370> the<00:03:17.639> two

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
quick comparison between the two

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:22.330 
quick comparison between the two
you<00:03:19.319> know<00:03:19.409> there's<00:03:19.620> hail<00:03:19.829> storm<00:03:20.159> with<00:03:20.989> mindset

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
you know there's hail storm with mindset

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.520 
you know there's hail storm with mindset
and<00:03:23.340> like<00:03:23.519> I<00:03:23.609> said<00:03:23.790> I<00:03:23.970> think<00:03:24.629> hail<00:03:24.930> storm<00:03:25.260> just

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
and like I said I think hail storm just

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.949 
and like I said I think hail storm just
looks<00:03:26.010> better<00:03:26.220> overall<00:03:26.970> as<00:03:27.090> a<00:03:27.120> figure<00:03:29.810> so<00:03:30.810> yeah

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
looks better overall as a figure so yeah

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:31.759 
looks better overall as a figure so yeah
if<00:03:31.049> you're<00:03:31.139> only<00:03:31.230> gonna<00:03:31.379> get<00:03:31.560> one<00:03:31.620> I

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
if you're only gonna get one I

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.580 
if you're only gonna get one I
definitely<00:03:32.129> get<00:03:32.340> hailstorm<00:03:32.819> of<00:03:32.909> the<00:03:33.060> two<00:03:33.590> but

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
definitely get hailstorm of the two but

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.020 
definitely get hailstorm of the two but
if<00:03:34.680> you<00:03:34.769> if<00:03:35.010> you<00:03:35.069> only<00:03:35.190> collect<00:03:35.370> Autobots<00:03:35.909> then

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
if you if you only collect Autobots then

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.530 
if you if you only collect Autobots then
mindset<00:03:36.810> might<00:03:36.989> be<00:03:37.139> an<00:03:37.199> option<00:03:37.349> for<00:03:37.530> you<00:03:38.540> so

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
mindset might be an option for you so

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.020 
mindset might be an option for you so
yeah<00:03:39.659> I<00:03:39.810> don't<00:03:40.260> really<00:03:40.379> have<00:03:40.620> a<00:03:40.650> lot<00:03:40.949> I'm<00:03:41.849> not

super<00:03:42.629> enthused<00:03:42.959> about<00:03:43.109> the<00:03:43.349> figure<00:03:43.560> he's<00:03:43.709> not

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859 
super enthused about the figure he's not

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:45.559 
super enthused about the figure he's not
bad

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
bad

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:48.439 
bad
they<00:03:46.500> said<00:03:46.739> I<00:03:46.769> kind<00:03:47.430> of<00:03:47.519> liked<00:03:47.729> the<00:03:47.819> squat<00:03:48.209> roof

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:48.449 
they said I kind of liked the squat roof

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:50.000 
they said I kind of liked the squat roof
design<00:03:48.659> but<00:03:49.139> like<00:03:49.260> I<00:03:49.349> said<00:03:49.409> I<00:03:49.560> think<00:03:49.709> hail

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
design but like I said I think hail

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.180 
design but like I said I think hail
storm<00:03:50.310> does<00:03:50.579> it<00:03:50.729> much<00:03:50.940> better<00:03:51.120> and<00:03:51.449> I<00:03:52.440> just

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
storm does it much better and I just

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.149 
storm does it much better and I just
can't<00:03:53.370> recommend<00:03:53.519> mindset<00:03:54.090> over<00:03:54.299> hail<00:03:54.449> storm

00:03:55.149 --> 00:03:55.159 
can't recommend mindset over hail storm

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:59.300 
can't recommend mindset over hail storm
but<00:03:56.159> there<00:03:56.280> you<00:03:56.340> go<00:03:56.459> there<00:03:56.760> is<00:03:56.940> the<00:03:58.129> reveal<00:03:59.129> the

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
but there you go there is the reveal the

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.810
