this is Karen Ramsey and I would like to
talk<00:00:09.760> about<00:00:10.120> nutrient<00:00:11.020> density<00:00:11.710> and<00:00:12.210> also

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:13.210 
talk about nutrient density and also

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.130 
talk about nutrient density and also
weight<00:00:13.570> loss<00:00:14.160> okay<00:00:15.270> when<00:00:16.270> we<00:00:16.540> eat<00:00:16.869> an

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:17.140 
weight loss okay when we eat an

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.370 
weight loss okay when we eat an
abundance<00:00:17.830> of<00:00:18.040> fruits<00:00:18.430> and<00:00:18.640> vegetables<00:00:19.509> we

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:20.380 
abundance of fruits and vegetables we

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.249 
abundance of fruits and vegetables we
are<00:00:20.829> getting<00:00:21.460> the<00:00:21.880> nutrient<00:00:22.450> density<00:00:22.899> that

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:23.259 
are getting the nutrient density that

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:28.429 
are getting the nutrient density that
our<00:00:23.470> body<00:00:23.980> craves<00:00:25.770> today<00:00:26.770> in<00:00:27.220> modern<00:00:27.640> world

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
our body craves today in modern world

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.950 
our body craves today in modern world
most<00:00:29.439> people<00:00:29.619> are<00:00:30.250> living<00:00:30.460> on<00:00:30.849> a<00:00:31.119> lot<00:00:31.630> of

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960 
most people are living on a lot of

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.340 
most people are living on a lot of
process<00:00:32.710> and<00:00:32.950> refined<00:00:33.430> foods<00:00:34.000> and<00:00:34.570> what

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
process and refined foods and what

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.260 
process and refined foods and what
happens<00:00:35.800> with<00:00:36.010> the<00:00:36.100> process<00:00:36.399> and<00:00:36.820> refined

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:37.270 
happens with the process and refined

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.710 
happens with the process and refined
foods<00:00:37.780> is<00:00:38.230> that<00:00:39.010> the<00:00:39.610> vitamins<00:00:40.180> and<00:00:40.570> the

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:40.720 
foods is that the vitamins and the

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.890 
foods is that the vitamins and the
minerals<00:00:40.930> are<00:00:41.470> all<00:00:41.590> depleted<00:00:42.310> so<00:00:43.150> what<00:00:43.750> they

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:43.900 
minerals are all depleted so what they

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.470 
minerals are all depleted so what they
do<00:00:43.960> instead<00:00:44.500> is<00:00:44.560> they<00:00:44.890> add<00:00:45.100> them<00:00:45.670> back<00:00:46.000> in

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.480 
do instead is they add them back in

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.000 
do instead is they add them back in
synthetic<00:00:47.200> form<00:00:48.040> so<00:00:48.700> that<00:00:48.730> you're<00:00:49.450> getting

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
synthetic form so that you're getting

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.910 
synthetic form so that you're getting
all<00:00:51.010> of<00:00:51.250> these<00:00:51.780> nutrients<00:00:52.780> in<00:00:52.990> a<00:00:53.650> synthetic

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
all of these nutrients in a synthetic

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.220 
all of these nutrients in a synthetic
form<00:00:54.190> that<00:00:54.730> the<00:00:54.850> body<00:00:55.120> has<00:00:55.660> a<00:00:55.690> hard<00:00:56.140> time

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.230 
form that the body has a hard time

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.510 
form that the body has a hard time
absorbing<00:00:57.190> and<00:00:57.730> especially<00:00:58.950> vitamin<00:00:59.950> C

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.520 
absorbing and especially vitamin C

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.819 
absorbing and especially vitamin C
vitamin<00:01:01.290> b1<00:01:02.290> and<00:01:02.940> folate<00:01:03.940> are<00:01:04.649> going<00:01:05.649> to<00:01:05.710> be

00:01:05.819 --> 00:01:05.829 
vitamin b1 and folate are going to be

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:08.850 
vitamin b1 and folate are going to be
void<00:01:06.100> even<00:01:06.790> if<00:01:07.030> they<00:01:07.240> are<00:01:07.509> added<00:01:08.110> back<00:01:08.350> they

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
void even if they are added back they

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.700 
void even if they are added back they
just<00:01:09.250> cannot<00:01:09.700> be<00:01:10.000> absorbed<00:01:10.600> from<00:01:11.140> synthetic

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
just cannot be absorbed from synthetic

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.700 
just cannot be absorbed from synthetic
sources<00:01:12.580> and<00:01:12.909> so<00:01:13.750> we<00:01:13.900> want<00:01:14.200> to<00:01:14.320> get<00:01:14.500> our

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
sources and so we want to get our

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.610 
sources and so we want to get our
nutrients<00:01:15.550> from<00:01:16.180> the<00:01:16.360> plant<00:01:16.690> foods<00:01:17.110> that<00:01:17.440> we

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:17.620 
nutrients from the plant foods that we

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.050 
nutrients from the plant foods that we
eat<00:01:17.650> and<00:01:18.220> we<00:01:18.640> need<00:01:18.909> to<00:01:18.940> be<00:01:19.180> eating<00:01:19.690> them<00:01:19.900> fresh

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
eat and we need to be eating them fresh

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.600 
eat and we need to be eating them fresh
so<00:01:22.060> I<00:01:22.420> highly<00:01:22.810> recommend<00:01:23.080> the<00:01:23.979> nutrient

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
so I highly recommend the nutrient

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.500 
so I highly recommend the nutrient
density<00:01:25.090> of<00:01:25.420> a<00:01:25.810> raw<00:01:26.110> food<00:01:26.950> diet<00:01:26.979> hua<00:01:27.850> vegan

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 
density of a raw food diet hua vegan

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
density of a raw food diet hua vegan
diet<00:01:29.340> so<00:01:30.340> the<00:01:30.520> fruits<00:01:30.850> and<00:01:31.000> the<00:01:31.299> vegetables

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
diet so the fruits and the vegetables

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.969 
diet so the fruits and the vegetables
especially<00:01:32.530> green<00:01:33.190> leafy<00:01:34.060> vegetables<00:01:34.979> now

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
especially green leafy vegetables now

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.020 
especially green leafy vegetables now
when<00:01:36.220> I<00:01:36.250> first<00:01:36.670> went<00:01:36.970> to<00:01:37.150> raw<00:01:37.450> foods<00:01:37.840> I<00:01:38.110> lost<00:01:38.560> a

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
when I first went to raw foods I lost a

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.090 
when I first went to raw foods I lost a
significant<00:01:40.030> amount<00:01:40.090> of<00:01:40.600> weight<00:01:40.659> i'm<00:01:41.560> not<00:01:42.040> a

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
significant amount of weight i'm not a

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.719 
significant amount of weight i'm not a
huge<00:01:42.490> person<00:01:43.119> to<00:01:43.270> begin<00:01:43.450> with<00:01:43.930> and<00:01:44.260> so<00:01:45.220> I<00:01:45.549> was

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
huge person to begin with and so I was

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.649 
huge person to begin with and so I was
about<00:01:46.950> 115<00:01:47.950> pounds<00:01:48.310> at<00:01:48.909> the<00:01:49.090> time<00:01:49.360> that<00:01:49.600> I

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
about 115 pounds at the time that I

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:52.910 
about 115 pounds at the time that I
transitioned<00:01:50.530> to<00:01:51.070> a<00:01:51.310> raw<00:01:51.640> food<00:01:51.909> lifestyle

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
transitioned to a raw food lifestyle

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.710 
transitioned to a raw food lifestyle
about<00:01:53.920> 19<00:01:54.460> years<00:01:54.490> ago<00:01:55.240> and<00:01:56.580> that<00:01:57.720> transition

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
about 19 years ago and that transition

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.710 
about 19 years ago and that transition
over<00:01:59.290> time<00:01:59.820> caused<00:02:00.820> me<00:02:01.030> to<00:02:01.210> lose<00:02:01.240> an

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
over time caused me to lose an

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.740 
over time caused me to lose an
incredible<00:02:02.350> amount<00:02:02.530> of<00:02:02.979> weight<00:02:03.280> and<00:02:03.580> a<00:02:04.540> lot<00:02:04.720> of

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
incredible amount of weight and a lot of

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.780 
incredible amount of weight and a lot of
people<00:02:05.110> were<00:02:05.229> noticing<00:02:05.890> and<00:02:06.159> they<00:02:06.729> were

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
people were noticing and they were

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.080 
people were noticing and they were
recommending<00:02:07.479> that<00:02:07.509> I<00:02:07.630> start

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
recommending that I start

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.790 
recommending that I start
eating<00:02:08.300> cooked<00:02:08.569> food<00:02:08.869> again<00:02:09.170> and<00:02:09.379> even<00:02:09.649> they

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
eating cooked food again and even they

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.300 
eating cooked food again and even they
were<00:02:09.860> recommending<00:02:10.519> animal<00:02:11.030> foods<00:02:11.300> to<00:02:11.599> me<00:02:12.310> and

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
were recommending animal foods to me and

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.820 
were recommending animal foods to me and
of<00:02:13.459> course<00:02:13.489> I<00:02:13.819> wouldn't<00:02:14.360> do<00:02:14.690> that<00:02:14.720> because<00:02:15.260> I

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
of course I wouldn't do that because I

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.750 
of course I wouldn't do that because I
had<00:02:16.400> been<00:02:16.519> vegan<00:02:16.790> already<00:02:17.300> for<00:02:17.569> so<00:02:17.750> many<00:02:17.870> years

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
had been vegan already for so many years

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.199 
had been vegan already for so many years
and<00:02:19.760> I<00:02:20.480> believed<00:02:21.319> in<00:02:21.530> veganism<00:02:22.010> for<00:02:22.760> moral

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
and I believed in veganism for moral

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.770 
and I believed in veganism for moral
ethical<00:02:23.930> reasons<00:02:24.849> but<00:02:25.849> I<00:02:25.879> did<00:02:26.209> not<00:02:26.360> want<00:02:26.569> to<00:02:26.629> go

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
ethical reasons but I did not want to go

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.920 
ethical reasons but I did not want to go
back<00:02:26.989> to<00:02:27.019> eating<00:02:27.680> cooked<00:02:28.129> food<00:02:28.459> even<00:02:29.269> though<00:02:29.480> I

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
back to eating cooked food even though I

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.470 
back to eating cooked food even though I
had<00:02:30.260> lost<00:02:30.560> a<00:02:30.769> lot<00:02:30.950> of<00:02:30.980> weight<00:02:31.310> I<00:02:31.640> had<00:02:31.970> gone<00:02:32.120> down

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
had lost a lot of weight I had gone down

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.559 
had lost a lot of weight I had gone down
to<00:02:32.870> under<00:02:33.769> just<00:02:34.400> under<00:02:34.670> 100<00:02:35.060> pounds<00:02:35.989> and<00:02:36.310> so

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
to under just under 100 pounds and so

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.870 
to under just under 100 pounds and so
what<00:02:38.569> I<00:02:38.599> did<00:02:38.750> was<00:02:38.989> I<00:02:39.680> asked<00:02:40.519> a<00:02:40.579> number<00:02:40.730> of

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
what I did was I asked a number of

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.030 
what I did was I asked a number of

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
important for getting more calories I

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:10.579 
seeds a day I was still very thin I

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:13.210 
seeds a day I was still very thin I
couldn't<00:03:11.239> gain<00:03:11.480> weight<00:03:11.900> and<00:03:12.260> so<00:03:12.859> why<00:03:13.160> the

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
couldn't gain weight and so why the

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.759 
couldn't gain weight and so why the
people<00:03:13.880> who<00:03:14.060> go<00:03:14.269> to<00:03:14.299> the<00:03:14.540> raw<00:03:14.750> food<00:03:15.079> lifestyle

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
people who go to the raw food lifestyle

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:17.500 
people who go to the raw food lifestyle
and<00:03:16.069> are<00:03:16.160> eating<00:03:16.549> all<00:03:16.730> these<00:03:16.910> high<00:03:17.150> fatty

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
and are eating all these high fatty

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.470 
and are eating all these high fatty
foods<00:03:17.900> not<00:03:18.230> gain<00:03:18.560> weight<00:03:18.590> from<00:03:19.250> it<00:03:19.489> I<00:03:19.670> think

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
foods not gain weight from it I think

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.650 
foods not gain weight from it I think
what's<00:03:20.690> happening<00:03:21.230> is<00:03:21.440> that<00:03:21.530> the<00:03:21.799> body

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
what's happening is that the body

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.379 
what's happening is that the body
because<00:03:23.660> nut<00:03:24.109> is<00:03:24.260> not<00:03:24.470> able<00:03:24.680> to<00:03:24.980> absorb<00:03:25.670> all<00:03:26.329> of

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:26.389 
because nut is not able to absorb all of

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:31.089 
because nut is not able to absorb all of
those<00:03:26.900> fats<00:03:27.440> and<00:03:28.120> so<00:03:29.120> when<00:03:29.389> I<00:03:29.420> went<00:03:30.319> to<00:03:30.530> a<00:03:30.650> lower

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:31.099 
those fats and so when I went to a lower

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:33.970 
those fats and so when I went to a lower
fat<00:03:31.549> diet<00:03:31.940> and<00:03:32.420> still<00:03:32.750> incorporated<00:03:33.500> nuts<00:03:33.739> and

seeds and avocado but just lower amounts

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.849
