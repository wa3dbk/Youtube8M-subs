 Not really in the new but I did not do anything different 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:34.739
 it has become bad that at last more people recognize 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.960
 The guests had actually been clear for days 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.980
 Kartnig a coach at that time I was spotted eleven years old and asked if I 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.100
 that the legs are coming 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.280

 Rasmus Cup out 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.420
 I always liked to go to school just because I have a lot of friends and 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.170
 School had the mint-subjects sports course but also math 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.500
 warning words have arrived 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.500

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.970

 Advertising partners which is downtown 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.620

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.360
 the mouth water together 

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:17.059
 I think that we have a total of the first senior team 

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:20.059
 which can still learn a lot 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:29.430
 like the spine also on high level of the m10 on little things around the 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.430
 Game pretty big role and the important role 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.989
 yes, the whole world can be pretty much squeezed flour 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.999
 footballing has become the nations 

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:45.759

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:49.049
