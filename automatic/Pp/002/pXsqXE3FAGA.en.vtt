00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.000
 Hello and welcome to a degradation video guide from DPS - stingy points 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.909
 Marz idea helps crucial Biotop Bacher to discard 

00:00:11.909 --> 00:00:15.049
 in this video Burma briefly explain which successful ex-master 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:19.720
 Works with patch 4 2 06 Schaan usually went with the single fieldbuses 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.070
 do 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.960
 this galt does not only refer to ex-master but also 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.569
 all classes succeeded us 

00:00:25.569 --> 00:00:29.259
 So this video explains in general how to cost Michels succeeded one 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:30.720
 Class above a certain word 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.500
 Masses of crowds 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.830
 so it can not hurt the mirroring give Foam with it 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.860
 all games can think about it 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.000
 Advanced players we recommend our video already to the program for 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.420
 Spawn force with which to simulate boss fights and lists well there 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.180
 Can create many more video chats, there are only rent arrears or 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.210
 directly on our website www point dts - stinginess point de 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.260
 In addition, we are looking for employees who already have to create and next 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.290
 give our forum the opportunity to search as well as players the 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.670
 Possibility to search for a guild 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.680
 So we come to how it leads out which succeeded in which bus on 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.680
 strongest is 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.000
 To do this we use the website poses on the PS2 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.590
 late on the PSP honored the abandoned without a fight on the website will be on 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.610
 lure com upload and thus the averages based on the troop 200 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.990
 Player with a boss 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.990
 so who is visiting PSP com 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.340
 only the top right leads into a menu 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.580
 in the first except fixed Petersberg one can enter 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.490
 which data should be used 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.189
 only since the last patch 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.750
 or all since then the current one was online 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.760
 o'barry clear 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.070
 when teaching current results 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.830
 one gets only the dates since the last patch so here cheers here points 6 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.700
 the next option is the world's largest talk time 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.530
 Here you can distinguish between ten players and 25 games as well as between 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.530
 normal and Hartmut 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.530
 the Hartmut h Meinhard behind the number of players 

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:11.639
 the next option will be 

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:13.629
 determines the number of dates 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:17.279
 there is a choice between the evaluation of the data of the best 200 

00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:19.789
 and the best 40 players every kilo 

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:23.949
 this was extreme Scribd or crowded DPS guys with the Zivis Hi 

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:27.579
 River sends the best 40 results to a distortion of the Dow 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:28.680
 Lock values ​​can lead 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.680
 you should choose top 200 

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:35.819
 Last but not least you have the choice if you look at the values ​​for 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:37.989
 DDS Schranz where summer 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:39.019
 Hailer 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:42.450
 and let text ads let us exclude it entrenched where 

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:44.019
 Thing 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.019
 after clicking on seed you raise the desired tables 

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:59.299
 the first table on the left is called Oberrot Topuz 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:00.640
 So overall rating 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.969
 and returns averages for all t11 boss bouts 

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:07.639
 because the keep the PS as strong as in other bosses deviates and thus one 

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:10.629
 perfect image of the strength of individual classes we succeeded 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:15.229
 is there still the table daily Ropertz so adjusted total score 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:19.489
 This table covers all offenders could walk outside 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:23.149
 but also this table should not be overestimated 

00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:26.659
 the tables of each boss fights continue nonsense four more meaningful 

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:33.409
 Let's go with the Hechinger descent 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:37.349
 Sport makes Moroder Sony could Chimera Styling System and Aqua Med is Milo 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:40.349
 Explore Fahrion are listed here 

00:03:44.999 --> 00:03:47.089
 DS in parentheses few VG 

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:50.209
 Arthur g stands for English he regrets and means nothing more than 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:51.359
 average value 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:54.359
 the columns to the right show the media and the standard deviation 

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:58.379
 into the meaning of these values ​​and what now 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:02.220
 It should be short on Wikipedia or according to a commercial statistics book 

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:03.949
 look up 

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:08.049
 The percent column indicates how much percent this saved or saved 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:11.329
 Class compared to the strongest class made us successful at the boss 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:14.659
 then, make it so blunt copywriters cut only 7 90 percent of 

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:16.689
 Break Texas damage 

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:20.939
 Max down doers at certain bono bumps 70 percent of the damage a destruction 

00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:23.939
 6 on 

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:30.270
 one must also interpret the duty here in order to be valued correctly 

00:04:30.269 --> 00:04:31.879
 may have something more to know 

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:36.189
 this case about the boss and the mechanics of Affliction copywriter bombs at Max 

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:40.099
 Moor with the fire blatter corruption on the parasites and consumption from too 

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:43.520
 hold and thus also overall more charm still Bossen skeletons to make 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.379
 The same applies to the destruction of the Six Shadow flames on the parasites 

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:48.370
 Spells with this range are 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.800
 to save immediately at 9000 and more 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.789
 on that they make Omron of devastation 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:56.899
 this damage easily makes 4 million of total damage compared 

00:04:56.899 --> 00:05:00.229
 to Hamburg let out what of course the DPS in astronomical heights 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:01.419
 shoot 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:05.180
 Such tips such great cabinet can be found in our forum at www prompt the 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.240
 PFPO Skype points 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.450
 the last second temple simply indicates how many players are using the 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:11.060
 Skillung 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.580
 contributed to the displayed works 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.979
 you can see how many players go pop and how disgusting they are 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:19.900
 Bus x4 all play come to a short conclusion 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.090
 If you look at the values ​​for the technique, the tan has the destruction 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:26.009
 except at al-awlaki always from infirmity and monologues 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:29.770
 Luber MA Lohberg is by far the best in front of infirmities and monologues 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.499
 destruction 

00:05:31.499 --> 00:05:34.929
 the values ​​for the bastion of twilight the throne of the four winds and 

00:05:34.929 --> 00:05:38.399
 Albert can look at each one himself that has generally been decided since 

00:05:38.399 --> 00:05:40.039
 looking for the appearance of this video 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:43.039
 Newspaper from patch 4 2 06 could have changed a lot 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.860
 Incidentally, changes to Pettersson Optics can also be had with champagne on dts 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.159
 comprehend 

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:55.319
 the tenant table, there is a left track IT two weeks 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.849
 there you can see the graphs for the course of the DPS over the last two 

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:04.439
 Weeks leave ads 

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:07.659
 Normally, the blackboard should always rise slightly 

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:10.999
 As the grid player steadily improves, so does the player 

00:06:10.999 --> 00:06:13.050
 Fight to get to know each other better over time 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:17.750
 However, Salome's upward or downward increase may have 2 intimations 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.940
 either Vienna is significantly more or significantly less good players this 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.749
 enough or it gave you one of an extremely dpa or just classes 

00:06:24.749 --> 00:06:28.530
 when created priests would be patch 4 2 06 an extremely creek got 

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:31.530
 you could see this beautiful 

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:36.809
 The rankings Probost can also be found there since I have leg loads 

00:06:36.809 --> 00:06:37.830
 our print 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.830
 a few occurred 

00:06:42.789 --> 00:06:45.789
 so it's already come as anadys like itching 

00:06:46.809 --> 00:06:49.929
 if now fallen again and the soil is we would be happy if you 

00:06:49.929 --> 00:06:53.019
 on the thumbs up symbol under the video libraries wolves that will be ours 

00:06:53.019 --> 00:06:55.520
 Work and motivate people to make such videos 

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.970
 To Loeper critics will speak or otherwise has dozens of suggestions 

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:02.580
 Comment function under this video or directly our forum at www and 

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:06.520
 GPS - irritant point de also it makes sense our medium sized but 

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.050
 never because and also because I moved in America to look at our city
