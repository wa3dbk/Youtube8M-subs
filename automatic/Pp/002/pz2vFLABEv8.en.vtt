00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.870
 many wonder if the 

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:06.040
 rebalancing exists on foot 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.870
 so I called the after-sales service 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:26.579
 10 and sports to ask them the question 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:28.689
 answer now yes hello sir 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:32.920
 so I play did a little but the 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:35.800
 team 14 and actually I bought some 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.020
 fifa points i bought fifa breads 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:42.250
 so I could with luck in the 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:45.370
 packs have good players but what 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.980
 I do not understand that after I 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.980
 so I could make a nice team but 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.420
 I have a hard time winning 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.719
 before I got better at winning I 'll 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:58.179
 know friends told me about the du 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:59.920
 rebalancing what is it for 

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:01.899
 I do not understand and badly I want 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:10.560
 to know if it existed if I had him 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:10.560
 better sell but joel me all the time 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:18.520
 not that it's something that are 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.180
 behind me the balances whatever 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:27.000
 thing that makes it just I did not know 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.000
 what can their match and you have them 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.650
 workers low long it would have taken advantage 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.140
 My opinion 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.690
 I think that in fact everything is said or 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.960
 win me this is my chance to cias to 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:46.000
 it may be because sometimes 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.970
 we expect to play well with a team 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.890
 like that and in the end we have time 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.890
 is struggling and we wonder why they 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.100
 okay the German tanit did not deliver 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:07.840
 the 8th is a little male but you are fighting 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.440
 ok ok thank you very much sir and 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.489
