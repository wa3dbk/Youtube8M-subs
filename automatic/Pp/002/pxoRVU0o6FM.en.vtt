00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.600
 good he says today this part of 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.130
 fishing she's going to be a little bit 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.840
 particular in the sense that we are going 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.970
 to be interested in something other than 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.039
 material for the wii for fishing 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.839
 sea predator the bar in this case 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.009
 it takes guns give up their course 

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:24.499
 trace reels etc 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:27.079
 but what is important above all 

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:29.989
 already at the level of safety and for fishing 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:30.979
 in my opinion is indispensable it is 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:32.480
 the electronic device 

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:34.460
 the electronic instrumentation nation 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.789
 of an electronic patient gps and 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.829
 pollsters or combined sonar gps so the 

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:42.130
 program it's simple we'll try to 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:45.850
 understand the information that 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:47.920
 will give us the sounder change the 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.490
 interpret for fishing the fishery 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.350
 draw conclusions marked posts 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:55.330
 discover posts analyze the 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.800
 cartography these are its functions that we 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.350
 can use the placement in the 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.500
 drift his cards and weppes 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.900
 points 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.200
 the small setting I would say enough 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:08.330
 succinct but essential to enter 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.840
 the details throughout this part 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.660
 fishing 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.840
 quite and then we'll see and we'll 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.040
 prove that it's an element it's in 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.090
 any case it is a guarantee of success a 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.280
 pledge of success is an element 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.930
 essential that that's for sure ok bah 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.040
 listen I hope the birds will be 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.640
 to the rendezvous as we can 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:29.100
 to please in 20 years I want to hold 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.900
 so there lately 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.670
 I managed to take some beautiful 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.710
 fish on the surface so I know you 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.600
 like it for that but we'll see also 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.479
 the pollster's interest in fishing for 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.100
 vertical and fishing on the fly we go 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.270
 target in twenty six targeted funds 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.509
 different fish did really 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.770
 here is a little luck it does not change 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.210
 never won advanced never won 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.310
 advanced but this time of the year 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.840
 there is still there is no problem 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.960
 what's interesting is that we're going 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.430
 able to go fishing on everything 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.720
 down they are all layers of water 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.580
 we'll see what the pollster tells us 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.110
 announcement be there and we'll try to 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.240
 work as well with jig kohler 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.679
 very rounded soft can fall into peach 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.039
 on the fly which is all fishing all 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:08.220
 peach 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:08.720
 he's going to serve here we're going to serve this 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.959
 apparatus 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.959
 it's gone 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:23.080
 potiche is happy to be with you 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:24.790
 again it's true so the homeland roof 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.340
 when we went out naked we are not 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.530
 not far away there are funds slightly 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.150
 sandy is playing well it's dirty 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.890
 it's sand with a little bit of 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.090
 thanks to above and before there are some 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.400
 branches that are well drawn 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.050
 on the map aulas so we will put some 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.730
 a few small strokes the second time 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.320
 can be good not his beautiful physio 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.040
 fish that pass you a little 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.910
 detection we are in a little water but 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.070
 they usually are fish to 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.970
 his little ones okay but he's already me 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.040
 arrived we will take 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.540
 among the small and big of a little water 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.130
 you obviously do not know it as my 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.170
 time like this and see it well 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.760
 surprises that can play what so the 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.470
 listen I'm lying to you 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.390
 stay at the surface surface I'm going 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.870
 start in surface agree and light 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:07.540
 please 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:09.750
 go it's gone the waters are very 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.750
 clear 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:19.380
 the others in the clear is good we see 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.610
 the background anything wrong for ical was the 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.160
 luck right now with his winds there that's 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.819
 allows to have others is very clear 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.819
 and it's really super nice 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:37.530
 and so nothing yeah there's a few 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:40.410
 individuals normally 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.700
 I always take a little here no 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.990
 when it's brewing too much on the other side so 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.450
 you want me to fold often twice 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.800
 on this coastline there because 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.200
 in spite of all that allows to have fun what 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.460
 yeah I laughed have some 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.760
 keys like that at the beginning of the game 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.380
 peach 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.450
 yeah that's it when it's funny 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:59.550
 Funny to tell you that it conditions 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:00.510
 here is May 7 in mouthing and I 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.270
 believe that I had I think I had 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.200
 a little stv2 not ok ok 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.190
 listen to me I've been fishing across a bit 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.990
 on the back because the current 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.010
 slightly behind us yeah so I 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:11.550
 will try to swing a little bit there 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.960
 to see what that gives fish in 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.310
 attack ben you see I have no time to 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:17.220
 finish the awesome sentence probed everything from 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.810
 next it's not you look dog gp 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.890
 saw nothing but saw nothing now I was 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.670
 went backwards and back to 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:21.870
 the rear 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.780
 I was squarely on the back of the 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.670
 boat and I fished a little bit to 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.290
 do you see what the current of 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.900
 our side no no it should go 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.710
 is not very big but I think he 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.710
 may be a bit stung 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:44.650
 either by acquitting yeah that's not it 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:59.820
 which was helpful on the surface and more 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:59.820
 awesome to read part is great 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:17.610

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.910
 so it's super fun to tactics 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.310
 put down they are all calibers and 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:44.010

 with but it's a doping product 

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:44.480
 nothing for granted

 ah yeah double-pointed attack to oneself 

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:12.379
 even the first good ones are feared 

00:07:08.289 --> 00:07:14.830
 move from the political phase 

00:07:12.379 --> 00:07:19.270
 Great 

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:21.700
