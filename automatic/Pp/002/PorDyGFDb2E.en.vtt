00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 Hello dear friends with you panda 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.500
 fx all we will have a review on in pharmacy 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.860
 herd see in their screens price tag 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.080
 of this player on pk rolls over 3 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.630
 million and actually you today 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.300
 will tell whether he is worth his money and 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.689
 in general, how is he a little more than that 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.000
 Imagine yourself actually go like this 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.300
 played about ten by this player 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.760
 matches and now in order will sort 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.640
 each summary of a given football player 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.670
 let's start speed speed basically so 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.309
 and it feels 92 it's just something 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.340
 unreal neither is walcott 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.940
 96 but also very very powerful speed 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.710
 throws like a cock you stop you stop 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.110
 also the trebulink of it is just 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.120
 delightful more than once circled in three 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.399
 four people feel in 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.350
 the trebulink is just amazing and it's 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.420
 generally the best footballer who 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.510
 in general when I either played in the plan 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.350
 dribbling so with this he has no 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.619
 of problems 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.000
 his blows are of course something that is not what 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.970
 you drink with your left foot 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.670
 somewhere 40 meters from thirty in general 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.460
 whatever scott distance beat his left 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.180
 foot young fucks almost everything in 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.150
 target 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.299
 in 90 percent of cases it falls into 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.860
 gates and goal flies shorter 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:25.049
 there are no problems with blows too 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.000
 no and if it does not touch the right foot 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.369
 he has no right leg at all, so 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.590
 never beat on you foot is 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.979
 feeling like forever food is not three 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.740
 stars one star if even total 0 so 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.680
 that he unfortunately 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.350
 us one-legged football player turns left-handed 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.659
 this is not the coolest 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.729
 the worst thing can be a footballer is 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.220
 working left foot because none in 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:52.640
 polis hides it with a foot not anyway 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:55.759
 did not play move quark rate him 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.369
 such high protection is average but clean 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:01.640
 likes to teach somewhere in the center of the field but in 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:03.500
 basically he hangs out somewhere latakia there like 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.110
 source in principle u can only 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.090
 use it over yourself in any way 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.280
 don't represent well and let's actually 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.380
 let's move on to the total stand and leonel 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.989
 messi its three million of course not 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:18.200
 worth the maximum price given by football players 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:21.350
 this thousand two hundred three hundred because i 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.360
 In this case, comparable to the aguero, I'm a game 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.220
 how would emission aguero in one team 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.900
 how would all these matches be bright 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.780
 much better show yourself first 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.280
 moisture era even the left foot somehow 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.739
 a worker, that is, there are four stars 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.890
 as far as I know it in the first in the second 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.720
 City body is much nicer harder 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.850
 shit everybody feel i mean he can 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.850
 break even though the analysis 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:46.900
 just stuck in defenders and everything 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:49.549
 there is a force 61 this is an extremely small force 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.230
 by the way in real football it is not bad so 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:54.230
 It behaves that is normal to that 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.690
 push and never falls Fesenko 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.239
 something to fall into the camp throw him well 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.519
 if he really is not going to have the washi 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.829
 only hitting is better than just the left 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:05.630
 a foot which i didn’t always fall and 3 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:09.829
 clay is essentially an ancient city ​​already 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:11.989
 okhuitelny so overpay 24 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:12.940
 million at the expense of three wrap of the left foot 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.240
 me and 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:19.300
 no point so there are such things 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:22.510
 football player is good but the goal is defined 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:25.090
 very high and unrealistic for such 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.700
 skill is just my opinion he can not 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.020
 agree with you duty panda fx put 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.280
