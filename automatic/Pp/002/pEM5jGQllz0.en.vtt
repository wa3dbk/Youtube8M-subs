seven eighths inch squares I've placed

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.429 
seven eighths inch squares I've placed
these<00:01:40.530> with<00:01:40.890> right<00:01:41.189> sides<00:01:41.520> together<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:42.439> then

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
these with right sides together and then

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.340 
these with right sides together and then
drawn<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:43.950> line<00:01:44.220> along<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.820> diagonal<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:45.750> so

that line then when you cut along the

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.999 
that line then when you cut along the
line<00:01:51.390> so<00:01:51.689> that<00:01:51.720> you<00:01:51.899> left<00:01:52.079> with<00:01:52.259> two<00:01:52.439> triangles

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
line so that you left with two triangles

up to give you two half square triangles

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.200 
up to give you two half square triangles
like<00:01:58.229> this<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.799> these<00:01:59.460> are<00:01:59.520> four<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.180> half

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
like this and these are four and a half

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.510 
like this and these are four and a half
inch<00:02:00.600> squares<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.560> now<00:02:01.799> that's<00:02:02.040> one<00:02:02.280> of<00:02:02.430> the

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
inch squares and now that's one of the

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.830 
inch squares and now that's one of the
main<00:02:02.729> blocks<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:04.259> other<00:02:04.409> one<00:02:04.680> is<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:05.369> a<00:02:06.000> to

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
main blocks and the other one is a a to

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.440 
main blocks and the other one is a a to
patch<00:02:07.140> now<00:02:07.920> what<00:02:08.310> I've<00:02:08.489> done<00:02:08.700> here<00:02:08.759> is<00:02:09.119> I've

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
patch now what I've done here is I've

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.380 
patch now what I've done here is I've
sewn<00:02:10.050> together<00:02:10.259> Turner<00:02:10.830> half<00:02:11.099> inch<00:02:11.280> strips<00:02:11.670> of

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
sewn together Turner half inch strips of

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.649 
sewn together Turner half inch strips of
colored<00:02:13.390> and<00:02:13.659> white<00:02:13.720> and<00:02:14.349> then<00:02:15.340> I've<00:02:15.640> cut<00:02:16.450> them

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:16.659 
colored and white and then I've cut them

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:18.479 
colored and white and then I've cut them
across<00:02:16.930> at<00:02:17.290> two<00:02:17.500> and<00:02:17.590> a<00:02:17.680> half<00:02:17.830> inch<00:02:18.099> intervals

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
across at two and a half inch intervals

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:23.580 
across at two and a half inch intervals
so<00:02:19.330> I<00:02:20.069> can<00:02:21.069> now<00:02:21.220> take<00:02:21.280> these<00:02:21.940> and<00:02:22.269> place<00:02:23.230> them

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
so I can now take these and place them

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.380 
so I can now take these and place them
like<00:02:24.099> this<00:02:24.340> if<00:02:24.580> I<00:02:24.670> just<00:02:24.879> turn<00:02:25.090> them<00:02:25.269> around

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
like this if I just turn them around

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.780 
like this if I just turn them around
that's<00:02:25.810> the<00:02:26.049> way<00:02:26.200> they<00:02:26.830> came<00:02:27.069> off<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:27.489> strip

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
that's the way they came off the strip

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.399 
that's the way they came off the strip
and<00:02:28.030> if<00:02:29.019> I<00:02:29.640> flip<00:02:30.640> one<00:02:31.000> then<00:02:31.870> you<00:02:31.900> see<00:02:32.230> you've

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:32.409 
and if I flip one then you see you've

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:34.770 
and if I flip one then you see you've
got<00:02:32.530> a<00:02:32.590> four<00:02:33.069> patch<00:02:33.310> unit<00:02:33.790> now<00:02:34.299> in<00:02:34.450> this<00:02:34.569> one

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
got a four patch unit now in this one

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.539 
got a four patch unit now in this one
I've<00:02:34.989> got<00:02:35.170> the<00:02:35.290> same<00:02:35.500> fabric<00:02:36.010> because<00:02:36.190> I<00:02:36.370> took

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
I've got the same fabric because I took

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:38.670 
I've got the same fabric because I took
them<00:02:36.879> both<00:02:37.000> from<00:02:37.239> this<00:02:37.480> strip<00:02:37.810> but<00:02:38.379> in<00:02:38.500> fact

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
them both from this strip but in fact

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.490 
them both from this strip but in fact
you<00:02:38.920> can<00:02:39.190> use<00:02:39.489> the<00:02:40.060> different<00:02:40.209> strips<00:02:40.690> so<00:02:41.319> that

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
you can use the different strips so that

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.170 
you can use the different strips so that
you<00:02:41.650> get<00:02:41.799> more<00:02:42.010> variety<00:02:42.489> within<00:02:42.730> your<00:02:42.970> full

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
you get more variety within your full

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.479 
you get more variety within your full
patch<00:02:43.420> so<00:02:43.989> now<00:02:44.200> I've<00:02:44.349> got<00:02:44.560> the<00:02:44.709> full<00:02:44.890> patch<00:02:45.099> and

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
patch so now I've got the full patch and

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.720 
patch so now I've got the full patch and
the<00:02:46.060> heart<00:02:46.629> of<00:02:46.750> a<00:02:46.810> triangle<00:02:47.079> and<00:02:47.349> I<00:02:48.129> can<00:02:48.549> start

to<00:02:48.910> build<00:02:48.940> the<00:02:49.269> closer<00:02:49.629> curled<00:02:50.260> blocks<00:02:51.269> this

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
to build the closer curled blocks this

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.509 
to build the closer curled blocks this
is<00:02:52.450> the<00:02:52.599> quilt<00:02:52.840> block<00:02:53.079> and<00:02:53.799> if<00:02:54.040> I<00:02:54.129> come<00:02:54.340> in<00:02:54.370> a

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
is the quilt block and if I come in a

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:55.979 
is the quilt block and if I come in a
bit<00:02:54.640> closer<00:02:54.879> you'll<00:02:55.150> be<00:02:55.299> able<00:02:55.390> to<00:02:55.510> see<00:02:55.750> how

except sit here the white squares are

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.210 
except sit here the white squares are
going<00:03:55.030> that<00:03:55.180> way<00:03:55.389> because<00:03:55.949> still<00:03:56.949> trying<00:03:57.160> to

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
going that way because still trying to

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.780 
going that way because still trying to
keep<00:03:57.400> to<00:03:57.609> the<00:03:57.730> diagonals<00:03:58.209> so<00:03:58.959> that<00:03:59.319> is<00:03:59.560> the<00:03:59.980> the

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
keep to the diagonals so that is the the

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.720 
keep to the diagonals so that is the the
basic<00:04:01.180> block<00:04:01.329> and<00:04:01.750> I've<00:04:02.590> made<00:04:02.919> nine<00:04:03.370> of<00:04:03.579> these

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
basic block and I've made nine of these

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.210 
basic block and I've made nine of these
for<00:04:04.120> this<00:04:04.239> quilt<00:04:04.540> just<00:04:05.290> a<00:04:05.500> quick<00:04:05.829> word<00:04:06.040> about

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
for this quilt just a quick word about

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.819 
for this quilt just a quick word about
how<00:04:06.579> I've<00:04:06.730> got<00:04:07.030> the<00:04:07.269> how<00:04:08.019> I<00:04:08.049> sewed<00:04:08.410> the<00:04:08.590> blocks

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:08.829 
how I've got the how I sewed the blocks

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:10.920 
how I've got the how I sewed the blocks
together<00:04:09.040> in<00:04:09.370> order<00:04:09.519> to<00:04:09.760> get<00:04:09.910> this<00:04:10.120> particular

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
together in order to get this particular

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.000 
together in order to get this particular
pattern<00:04:11.590> in<00:04:12.579> here<00:04:12.970> on<00:04:13.090> the<00:04:13.239> top<00:04:13.859> left<00:04:14.859> hand

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
pattern in here on the top left hand

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.129 
pattern in here on the top left hand
corner<00:04:15.220> I've<00:04:15.730> got<00:04:15.879> the<00:04:16.030> whites<00:04:16.239> diagonal<00:04:17.019> of

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139 
corner I've got the whites diagonal of

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:20.310 
corner I've got the whites diagonal of
the<00:04:17.289> blog<00:04:17.500> going<00:04:17.889> upwards<00:04:18.609> like<00:04:18.729> that<00:04:19.199> in<00:04:20.199> the

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
the blog going upwards like that in the

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.779 
the blog going upwards like that in the
one<00:04:20.469> next<00:04:20.650> to<00:04:20.829> it<00:04:20.919> I've<00:04:21.280> got<00:04:21.310> the<00:04:21.669> white

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:21.789 
one next to it I've got the white

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:23.379 
one next to it I've got the white
diagonal<00:04:22.270> coming<00:04:22.570> down

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:23.389 
diagonal coming down

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:24.879 
diagonal coming down
and<00:04:23.479> in<00:04:23.629> the<00:04:23.780> third<00:04:23.810> 1<00:04:24.259> i've<00:04:24.319> got<00:04:24.650> the<00:04:24.770> white

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:24.889 
and in the third 1 i've got the white

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:27.399 
and in the third 1 i've got the white
diagonal<00:04:25.430> going<00:04:25.729> up<00:04:25.939> so<00:04:26.449> that's<00:04:26.719> created<00:04:27.229> that

00:04:27.399 --> 00:04:27.409 
diagonal going up so that's created that

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:31.059 
diagonal going up so that's created that
sort<00:04:27.650> of<00:04:27.740> zigzag<00:04:28.219> now<00:04:28.939> in<00:04:29.330> the<00:04:29.599> row<00:04:30.439> underneath

00:04:31.059 --> 00:04:31.069 
sort of zigzag now in the row underneath

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:38.019 
sort of zigzag now in the row underneath
that<00:04:31.129> i've<00:04:32.889> started<00:04:33.889> here<00:04:34.490> with<00:04:34.729> the<00:04:37.029> diagonal

00:04:38.019 --> 00:04:38.029 
that i've started here with the diagonal

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:41.170 
that i've started here with the diagonal
coming<00:04:38.389> down<00:04:38.659> and<00:04:39.020> then<00:04:39.529> it<00:04:39.680> goes<00:04:39.889> up<00:04:40.129> and<00:04:40.490> then

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
coming down and then it goes up and then

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.510 
coming down and then it goes up and then
it<00:04:41.360> comes<00:04:41.569> down<00:04:41.840> again<00:04:42.199> so<00:04:42.650> i've<00:04:42.949> also<00:04:43.129> got<00:04:43.490> a

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
it comes down again so i've also got a

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.909 
it comes down again so i've also got a
zigzag<00:04:43.969> here<00:04:44.210> again<00:04:44.569> but<00:04:45.110> i'm<00:04:45.229> starting<00:04:45.499> with

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 
zigzag here again but i'm starting with

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:47.739 
zigzag here again but i'm starting with
first<00:04:46.490> of<00:04:46.610> all<00:04:46.699> one<00:04:46.849> going<00:04:47.180> up<00:04:47.300> and<00:04:47.539> then<00:04:47.659> the

00:04:47.739 --> 00:04:47.749 
first of all one going up and then the

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:49.809 
first of all one going up and then the
one<00:04:47.870> beneath<00:04:48.020> it<00:04:48.289> going<00:04:48.560> down<00:04:48.800> and<00:04:49.069> then<00:04:49.610> for

00:04:49.809 --> 00:04:49.819 
one beneath it going down and then for

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:51.820 
one beneath it going down and then for
the<00:04:49.909> third<00:04:50.120> row<00:04:50.389> I've<00:04:50.659> got<00:04:50.900> the<00:04:51.229> diagonal

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
the third row I've got the diagonal

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.489 
the third row I've got the diagonal
going<00:04:52.129> up<00:04:52.550> like<00:04:52.969> that<00:04:53.270> and<00:04:53.569> then<00:04:53.960> down<00:04:54.199> and

00:04:54.489 --> 00:04:54.499 
going up like that and then down and

00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:57.189 
going up like that and then down and
then<00:04:54.610> up<00:04:55.610> there<00:04:56.330> are<00:04:56.509> of<00:04:56.659> course<00:04:56.689> lots<00:04:57.020> of

00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:57.199 
then up there are of course lots of

00:04:57.199 --> 00:04:58.269 
then up there are of course lots of
different<00:04:57.469> ways<00:04:57.590> that<00:04:57.620> you<00:04:57.800> could<00:04:58.039> pull<00:04:58.250> it

00:04:58.269 --> 00:04:58.279 
different ways that you could pull it

00:04:58.279 --> 00:05:00.040 
different ways that you could pull it
together<00:04:58.460> but<00:04:59.150> that's<00:04:59.360> what<00:04:59.659> will<00:04:59.810> give<00:04:59.930> you

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
together but that's what will give you

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.879 
together but that's what will give you
this<00:05:00.199> design<00:05:00.979> that<00:05:01.430> I've<00:05:01.669> used<00:05:01.909> I've

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:02.889 
this design that I've used I've

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:05.439 
this design that I've used I've
certainly<00:05:03.889> quilt<00:05:04.159> locks<00:05:04.370> together<00:05:04.550> in<00:05:05.029> three

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:05.449 
certainly quilt locks together in three

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:07.510 
certainly quilt locks together in three
rows<00:05:05.629> of<00:05:05.689> three<00:05:05.960> now<00:05:06.469> so<00:05:06.740> I've<00:05:06.889> got<00:05:07.069> a<00:05:07.099> square

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
rows of three now so I've got a square

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.119 
rows of three now so I've got a square
the<00:05:08.240> first<00:05:08.270> border<00:05:09.020> I've<00:05:09.080> made<00:05:09.289> using<00:05:09.680> two<00:05:10.009> and

at forty eight and a half inches across

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:19.929 
at forty eight and a half inches across
the<00:05:16.129> chopper<00:05:16.339> bottom<00:05:16.819> and<00:05:17.770> two<00:05:18.770> at<00:05:19.099> fifty<00:05:19.759> two

the chopper bottom and two at fifty two
and<00:05:20.060> a<00:05:20.089> half<00:05:20.210> inches<00:05:20.360> to<00:05:20.779> go<00:05:20.900> down<00:05:21.110> the<00:05:21.229> sides

00:05:21.959 --> 00:05:21.969 
and a half inches to go down the sides

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:24.459 
and a half inches to go down the sides
for<00:05:22.969> the<00:05:23.089> second<00:05:23.449> border<00:05:23.749> I<00:05:23.779> wanted<00:05:24.169> to<00:05:24.259> use

00:05:24.459 --> 00:05:24.469 
for the second border I wanted to use

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:26.709 
for the second border I wanted to use
the<00:05:24.740> same<00:05:25.669> shapes<00:05:25.939> that<00:05:26.060> are<00:05:26.180> used<00:05:26.449> in<00:05:26.599> the

00:05:26.709 --> 00:05:26.719 
the same shapes that are used in the

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:28.390 
the same shapes that are used in the
quilt<00:05:26.990> so<00:05:27.229> that's<00:05:27.409> the<00:05:27.560> hospital<00:05:28.069> I<00:05:28.129> angles

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
quilt so that's the hospital I angles

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.510 
quilt so that's the hospital I angles
and<00:05:28.610> the<00:05:28.669> ball<00:05:29.449> patch<00:05:29.629> units<00:05:30.050> so<00:05:30.770> I've<00:05:31.129> made<00:05:31.490> a

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
and the ball patch units so I've made a

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:32.950 
and the ball patch units so I've made a
lot<00:05:31.819> of<00:05:31.879> these<00:05:32.089> and<00:05:32.330> sewing<00:05:32.539> them<00:05:32.719> together

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 
lot of these and sewing them together

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.079 
lot of these and sewing them together
like<00:05:33.259> this<00:05:33.620> so<00:05:33.889> that<00:05:34.039> they<00:05:34.189> form<00:05:34.250> a<00:05:34.580> larger

00:05:35.079 --> 00:05:35.089 
like this so that they form a larger

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:39.369 
like this so that they form a larger
black<00:05:35.750> triangle<00:05:36.610> and<00:05:37.610> for<00:05:38.389> each<00:05:38.539> side<00:05:38.930> you'll

00:05:39.369 --> 00:05:39.379 
black triangle and for each side you'll

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:43.510 
black triangle and for each side you'll
need<00:05:40.240> six<00:05:41.240> of<00:05:41.509> these<00:05:41.740> larger<00:05:42.740> triangles<00:05:43.279> so

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 
need six of these larger triangles so

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.409 
need six of these larger triangles so
that's<00:05:43.729> 12<00:05:44.509> individual<00:05:45.379> ha<00:05:45.529> square<00:05:45.800> triangles

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:46.419 
that's 12 individual ha square triangles

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:49.209 
that's 12 individual ha square triangles
and<00:05:47.419> then<00:05:47.839> at<00:05:48.020> the<00:05:48.080> end<00:05:48.169> of<00:05:48.439> each<00:05:48.589> you<00:05:48.979> need<00:05:49.189> a
