00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.060 

well<00:00:27.630> as<00:00:27.929> we<00:00:28.079> can<00:00:28.169> see<00:00:28.380> gone<00:00:28.560> over<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.859> footage

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
well as we can see gone over the footage

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.979 
well as we can see gone over the footage
Ben<00:00:29.820> left<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.119> start<00:00:30.359> line<00:00:30.570> obviously<00:00:30.900> the

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:30.989 
Ben left the start line obviously the

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:33.200 
Ben left the start line obviously the
run<00:00:31.140> before<00:00:31.289> he'd<00:00:32.219> run<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.399> world<00:00:32.640> record<00:00:33.000> and

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
run before he'd run a world record and

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.610 
run before he'd run a world record and
he<00:00:33.329> probably<00:00:33.570> wanted<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.079> repeat<00:00:34.320> that'll

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
he probably wanted to repeat that'll

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.259 
he probably wanted to repeat that'll
step<00:00:34.800> it<00:00:34.890> up<00:00:34.949> a<00:00:35.070> bit<00:00:35.100> so<00:00:35.399> he's<00:00:35.820> on<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:35.970> cutting

00:00:36.259 --> 00:00:36.269 
step it up a bit so he's on the cutting

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:38.240 
step it up a bit so he's on the cutting
edge<00:00:36.390> of<00:00:36.510> those<00:00:36.750> those<00:00:37.410> cars<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.890> run<00:00:38.040> in<00:00:38.160> the

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
edge of those those cars to run in the

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.090 
edge of those those cars to run in the
race<00:00:38.399> track<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.899> so<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.440> car<00:00:40.649> left<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:40.920> line

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
race track and so the car left the line

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.649 
race track and so the car left the line
dead<00:00:41.370> straight<00:00:41.579> that<00:00:41.699> cars<00:00:41.940> been<00:00:42.030> in<00:00:42.180> behavior

dead straight that cars been in behavior

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:44.210 
dead straight that cars been in behavior
well<00:00:42.839> he<00:00:43.260> got<00:00:43.409> it<00:00:43.470> he<00:00:43.620> just<00:00:43.769> loyally<00:00:44.070> just

well he got it he just loyally just
punched<00:00:44.489> in<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.670> third<00:00:44.850> year<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.809> car

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
punched in the third year and the car

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.990 
punched in the third year and the car
lifted<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.680> take<00:00:46.860> off<00:00:47.010> again<00:00:47.159> just<00:00:47.730> like<00:00:47.850> some

lifted to take off again just like some

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.280 
lifted to take off again just like some
air<00:00:48.149> got<00:00:48.329> underneath<00:00:48.540> the<00:00:48.720> car<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.050> lifted

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.290 
air got underneath the car and lifted

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:50.840 
air got underneath the car and lifted
the<00:00:49.350> car<00:00:49.530> off<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.680> ground<00:00:49.800> obviously<00:00:50.729> then

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
the car off the ground obviously then

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.700 
the car off the ground obviously then

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
the controls are of no use to you at all

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.979 
the controls are of no use to you at all
it<00:00:53.010> went<00:00:53.250> up<00:00:53.370> on<00:00:53.489> its<00:00:53.610> left<00:00:53.850> crossed<00:00:54.629> over<00:00:54.870> the

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
it went up on its left crossed over the

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.139 
it went up on its left crossed over the
racetrack<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.680> that<00:00:55.949> what<00:00:56.399> above<00:00:56.640> Ben's<00:00:56.879> head

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
racetrack and that what above Ben's head

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.479 
racetrack and that what above Ben's head
is<00:00:57.269> where<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:57.540> impacted<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.140> wall<00:00:58.289> so<00:00:58.620> it's

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
is where it impacted the wall so it's

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.069 
is where it impacted the wall so it's
probably<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.789> worst<00:00:59.940> case<00:01:00.329> scenario<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:00.899> him

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
probably the worst case scenario of him

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.500 
probably the worst case scenario of him
at<00:01:01.199> that<00:01:01.320> at<00:01:01.530> that<00:01:01.559> point

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
at that at that point

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.050 
at that at that point
now<00:01:03.510> obviously<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:04.410> the<00:01:05.100> that's<00:01:05.519> an<00:01:05.640> NHRA

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
now obviously the the that's an NHRA

these cars are built from the

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.660 
these cars are built from the
information<00:01:12.750> that<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.259> NHRA<00:01:13.800> gather<00:01:14.340> over

hundreds and hundreds of runs and dozens
and<00:01:17.100> dozens<00:01:17.190> of<00:01:17.580> accidents<00:01:18.149> so<00:01:18.330> they<00:01:19.050> know

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
and dozens of accidents so they know

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.930 
and dozens of accidents so they know
where<00:01:19.440> to<00:01:19.470> put<00:01:19.679> the<00:01:19.770> crushed<00:01:20.009> points<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.550> you

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 
where to put the crushed points and you

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.460 
where to put the crushed points and you
know<00:01:21.060> where<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.450> put<00:01:21.630> this<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.020> so<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.289> car

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
know where to put this and so the car

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.649 
know where to put this and so the car
breaks<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.860> lot<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.130> takes<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.429> impact<00:01:23.789> and

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
breaks a lot and takes the impact and

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.240 
breaks a lot and takes the impact and
saves<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.140> drives<00:01:25.319> all<00:01:25.500> about<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.860> drive<00:01:26.069> and

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
saves the drives all about the drive and

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.800 
saves the drives all about the drive and
saving<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.700> driver<00:01:26.940> in<00:01:27.300> this<00:01:27.569> type<00:01:27.780> of

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
your bodies basically that way and then

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.389 
your bodies basically that way and then
all<00:02:01.229> of<00:02:01.259> a<00:02:01.320> sudden<00:02:01.590> gets<00:02:01.770> thrown<00:02:01.979> back<00:02:02.039> that

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
way so in into the roll cage and that's

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.429 
way so in into the roll cage and that's
the<00:02:06.000> type<00:02:06.180> of<00:02:06.329> injury<00:02:06.600> that<00:02:06.750> Ben's<00:02:06.930> got<00:02:07.200> there

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
that is to do with the type of impact

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.040 
that is to do with the type of impact
the<00:02:43.970> expecting<00:02:44.450> to<00:02:44.510> have<00:02:44.630> obviously<00:02:44.960> an

the expecting to have obviously an

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.200 
the expecting to have obviously an
accident<00:02:45.410> you<00:02:45.470> can't<00:02:45.710> you<00:02:46.490> know<00:02:46.580> predict<00:02:47.090> what

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.210 
accident you can't you know predict what

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.000 
accident you can't you know predict what
sort<00:02:47.390> of<00:02:47.420> impact<00:02:47.660> you're<00:02:47.810> gonna<00:02:47.960> have<00:02:48.140> but<00:02:48.620> you

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
sort of impact you're gonna have but you

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.320 
sort of impact you're gonna have but you
know<00:02:49.100> neck<00:02:49.310> braces<00:02:49.610> and<00:02:49.910> all<00:02:50.000> the<00:02:50.090> stuff<00:02:50.300> that

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
know neck braces and all the stuff that

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.240 
know neck braces and all the stuff that
we<00:02:50.540> do<00:02:50.690> where<00:02:50.930> obviously<00:02:51.560> it<00:02:51.890> would<00:02:52.010> have<00:02:52.040> all

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
we do where obviously it would have all

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.940 
we do where obviously it would have all
helped<00:02:52.570> the<00:02:53.570> initial<00:02:54.230> impact<00:02:54.590> event<00:02:54.860> would

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
helped the initial impact event would

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.170 
helped the initial impact event would
have<00:02:55.040> done<00:02:55.160> most<00:02:55.400> of<00:02:55.550> the<00:02:55.610> damage<00:02:55.910> that<00:02:55.940> he's

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
have done most of the damage that he's

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.240 
have done most of the damage that he's
sustained<00:02:56.600> and<00:02:56.840> then<00:02:57.200> rond<00:02:57.590> revolving<00:02:58.190> around

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
sustained and then rond revolving around

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:59.860 
sustained and then rond revolving around
the<00:02:58.430> track<00:02:58.670> probably<00:02:59.000> you<00:02:59.420> know<00:02:59.570> it<00:02:59.630> scared

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
the track probably you know it scared

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.270 
the track probably you know it scared
the<00:02:59.960> piss<00:03:00.080> out<00:03:00.290> of<00:03:00.320> him<00:03:00.470> I<00:03:00.560> suppose<00:03:00.800> and<00:03:01.100> it

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
the piss out of him I suppose and it

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.220 
the piss out of him I suppose and it
wouldn't<00:03:01.490> be<00:03:01.550> very<00:03:01.580> pleasant<00:03:02.120> at<00:03:02.180> all<00:03:02.270> but<00:03:02.510> you

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
wouldn't be very pleasant at all but you

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.600 
wouldn't be very pleasant at all but you
know<00:03:03.350> the<00:03:03.500> initial<00:03:03.770> impact<00:03:04.040> is<00:03:04.190> what<00:03:04.340> happened

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
know the initial impact is what happened

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.160 
know the initial impact is what happened
and<00:03:04.730> when<00:03:05.120> the<00:03:05.240> car's<00:03:05.480> not<00:03:05.720> built<00:03:05.930> to<00:03:05.960> take

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
and when the car's not built to take

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:07.960 
and when the car's not built to take
that<00:03:06.380> type<00:03:06.590> of<00:03:06.620> impact<00:03:06.830> the<00:03:07.160> only<00:03:07.550> damage<00:03:07.850> to

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
that type of impact the only damage to

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.820 
that type of impact the only damage to
the<00:03:08.060> car<00:03:08.270> basically<00:03:08.930> other<00:03:09.320> than<00:03:09.410> you<00:03:09.710> know

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
the car basically other than you know

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.980 
the car basically other than you know
fiberglass<00:03:10.520> and<00:03:10.640> stuff<00:03:10.910> is<00:03:11.090> that<00:03:11.330> bar

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990 
fiberglass and stuff is that bar

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.460 
fiberglass and stuff is that bar
straight<00:03:12.410> above<00:03:12.680> his<00:03:12.800> head<00:03:12.950> so<00:03:13.960> it<00:03:14.960> wasn't<00:03:15.410> a

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
straight above his head so it wasn't a

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.200 
straight above his head so it wasn't a
normal<00:03:15.860> type<00:03:16.280> of<00:03:16.400> accident<00:03:16.760> but<00:03:16.850> I<00:03:16.910> mean<00:03:17.120> you

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:17.210 
normal type of accident but I mean you

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:18.700 
normal type of accident but I mean you
can<00:03:17.360> never<00:03:17.420> predict<00:03:17.810> anything<00:03:18.050> can<00:03:18.290> happen<00:03:18.350> in

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:18.710 
can never predict anything can happen in

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.280 
can never predict anything can happen in
race<00:03:19.220> cars<00:03:19.460> so<00:03:19.610> I<00:03:20.000> think<00:03:20.570> but<00:03:20.840> all<00:03:20.930> the<00:03:21.050> safety

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
race cars so I think but all the safety

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.110 
race cars so I think but all the safety

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.240 
it was just a rare type of accident

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.390 
it was just a rare type of accident
he<00:03:32.240> has<00:03:32.630> three<00:03:32.870> fractured<00:03:33.560> vertebrae<00:03:33.980> one

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
he has three fractured vertebrae one

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.450 
he has three fractured vertebrae one
seriously<00:03:34.970> and<00:03:35.530> he<00:03:36.530> has<00:03:36.710> six<00:03:37.100> broken<00:03:37.280> ribs

with multiple breaks I have swollen

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.580 
with multiple breaks I have swollen
lungs<00:03:39.890> and<00:03:40.250> they<00:03:41.150> inhaled<00:03:41.750> probably<00:03:42.320> I<00:03:42.560> think

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
lungs and they inhaled probably I think

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:43.960 
lungs and they inhaled probably I think
the<00:03:42.800> four<00:03:43.040> extinguisher<00:03:43.550> or<00:03:43.610> something<00:03:43.880> like

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
the four extinguisher or something like

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.340 
the four extinguisher or something like
that<00:03:44.180> now<00:03:44.510> they're<00:03:44.720> treating<00:03:44.870> that<00:03:45.080> as<00:03:45.140> they

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
that now they're treating that as they

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:46.960 
that now they're treating that as they
go<00:03:45.530> it<00:03:45.710> sort<00:03:45.950> of<00:03:46.040> I<00:03:46.220> mean<00:03:46.580> obviously<00:03:46.820> they're

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
go it sort of I mean obviously they're

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.760 
go it sort of I mean obviously they're
concerned<00:03:47.270> about<00:03:47.420> all<00:03:47.690> these<00:03:47.780> injuries<00:03:48.230> but

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:48.770 
concerned about all these injuries but

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.520 
concerned about all these injuries but
he<00:03:49.580> they're<00:03:50.210> more<00:03:50.450> concerned<00:03:50.780> about<00:03:50.870> the<00:03:51.230> the

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
he they're more concerned about the the

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.020 
he they're more concerned about the the
spinal<00:03:51.980> injury<00:03:52.220> than<00:03:52.340> they<00:03:52.430> are<00:03:52.460> about<00:03:52.790> any<00:03:52.970> of

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
spinal injury than they are about any of

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.370 
spinal injury than they are about any of
the<00:03:53.090> other<00:03:53.210> stuff<00:03:53.420> I<00:03:53.570> think<00:03:53.630> the<00:03:54.050> other<00:03:54.170> stuff

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
the other stuff I think the other stuff

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
the other stuff I think the other stuff
I<00:03:54.440> think<00:03:54.590> they<00:03:54.680> understand<00:03:55.220> where<00:03:55.310> that's

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
I think they understand where that's

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.300 
I think they understand where that's
going<00:03:55.550> to<00:03:55.610> go<00:03:55.700> and<00:03:56.030> they<00:03:56.420> can't<00:03:56.660> treat<00:03:56.870> it<00:03:57.020> all

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
going to go and they can't treat it all

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.890 
going to go and they can't treat it all
he<00:03:58.310> also<00:03:58.490> has<00:03:58.670> grazes<00:03:59.150> obviously<00:03:59.540> in<00:03:59.630> his<00:03:59.660> head

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
he also has grazes obviously in his head

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.360 
he also has grazes obviously in his head
his<00:04:00.110> face<00:04:00.140> and<00:04:00.470> he's<00:04:00.590> chin<00:04:00.830> that<00:04:01.010> from<00:04:01.220> the

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
his face and he's chin that from the

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.130 
his face and he's chin that from the
helmet<00:04:01.730> so<00:04:01.880> he<00:04:02.360> obviously<00:04:02.450> took<00:04:02.750> a<00:04:02.840> pretty

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
helmet so he obviously took a pretty

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.660 
helmet so he obviously took a pretty
good<00:04:03.350> whack<00:04:03.500> when<00:04:03.710> he<00:04:03.800> sort<00:04:04.010> of<00:04:04.070> when<00:04:04.520> he<00:04:04.580> got

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
good whack when he sort of when he got

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.990 
good whack when he sort of when he got
the<00:04:04.820> wall<00:04:04.970> inside<00:04:05.330> the<00:04:05.450> helmet<00:04:05.630> so<00:04:06.640> as<00:04:07.640> far<00:04:07.940> as

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
the wall inside the helmet so as far as

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.490 
the wall inside the helmet so as far as
his<00:04:08.210> prognosis<00:04:08.450> goes<00:04:08.990> well<00:04:09.200> they're<00:04:09.320> still

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
his prognosis goes well they're still

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
his prognosis goes well they're still
doing<00:04:09.620> a<00:04:09.710> little<00:04:09.830> bit<00:04:09.950> touring<00:04:10.250> this<00:04:10.340> is<00:04:10.430> only

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:10.520 
doing a little bit touring this is only

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.120 
doing a little bit touring this is only
early<00:04:10.760> days<00:04:11.030> they've<00:04:11.960> done<00:04:12.170> some<00:04:12.530> scans<00:04:12.890> and

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
early days they've done some scans and

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:14.410 
early days they've done some scans and
that<00:04:13.220> mobile<00:04:13.610> information<00:04:13.790> they<00:04:14.210> need

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
that mobile information they need

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.780 
that mobile information they need
they've<00:04:15.080> had<00:04:15.200> a<00:04:15.230> few<00:04:15.560> orthopedic<00:04:16.280> doctors<00:04:16.670> and

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
they've had a few orthopedic doctors and

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.400 
they've had a few orthopedic doctors and
surgeons<00:04:17.180> have<00:04:17.299> a<00:04:17.330> good<00:04:17.750> look<00:04:17.870> at<00:04:17.989> him<00:04:18.080> to<00:04:18.200> talk

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
surgeons have a good look at him to talk

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.380 
surgeons have a good look at him to talk
about<00:04:18.530> it<00:04:18.830> and<00:04:19.040> I<00:04:19.310> think<00:04:19.400> tomorrow<00:04:19.790> at<00:04:20.150> this

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390 
about it and I think tomorrow at this

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.300 
about it and I think tomorrow at this
stage<00:04:20.690> they're<00:04:21.350> going<00:04:21.500> to<00:04:21.590> try<00:04:21.830> and<00:04:21.950> stand<00:04:22.130> him

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
stage they're going to try and stand him

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.130 
stage they're going to try and stand him
up<00:04:22.430> and<00:04:22.550> take<00:04:22.730> some<00:04:22.760> more<00:04:23.030> images<00:04:23.150> to<00:04:23.450> get<00:04:24.110> a

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140 
up and take some more images to get a

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.540 
up and take some more images to get a
really<00:04:24.410> good<00:04:24.530> idea<00:04:24.590> of<00:04:24.950> how<00:04:25.040> badly<00:04:25.310> that

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
really good idea of how badly that

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.880 
really good idea of how badly that
multiple<00:04:26.060> damaged<00:04:26.620> vertebra<00:04:27.620> isn't<00:04:27.830> a

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:27.890 
multiple damaged vertebra isn't a

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:29.470 
multiple damaged vertebra isn't a
treatment<00:04:28.190> they<00:04:28.340> can<00:04:28.490> take<00:04:28.700> it<00:04:28.820> from<00:04:28.880> there<00:04:29.120> is

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:29.480 
treatment they can take it from there is

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.290 
treatment they can take it from there is
an<00:04:29.600> operation<00:04:30.140> that<00:04:30.320> they<00:04:31.070> can<00:04:31.250> do<00:04:31.430> to<00:04:31.670> in<00:04:32.090> this

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
an operation that they can do to in this

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.140 
an operation that they can do to in this
sort<00:04:32.930> of<00:04:32.990> instance<00:04:33.350> but<00:04:33.920> apparently<00:04:34.670> it's<00:04:35.060> not

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
sort of instance but apparently it's not

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.390 
sort of instance but apparently it's not
a<00:04:35.270> great<00:04:36.140> operation<00:04:36.500> have<00:04:36.800> done<00:04:36.980> to<00:04:37.070> yourself

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
a great operation have done to yourself

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.560 
a great operation have done to yourself
and<00:04:37.580> the<00:04:37.640> doctors<00:04:37.940> don't<00:04:38.090> seem<00:04:38.330> to<00:04:38.450> really

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
and the doctors don't seem to really

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.300 
and the doctors don't seem to really
like<00:04:38.750> doing<00:04:38.960> it<00:04:39.170> if<00:04:39.470> they<00:04:39.680> don't<00:04:39.890> have<00:04:40.010> to<00:04:40.130> so

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
like doing it if they don't have to so

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.310 
like doing it if they don't have to so
they're<00:04:40.490> currently<00:04:41.210> trying<00:04:41.510> to<00:04:41.600> just<00:04:42.110> get<00:04:42.290> a

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
they're currently trying to just get a

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.650 
they're currently trying to just get a
better<00:04:42.530> picture<00:04:42.800> of<00:04:43.130> the<00:04:44.000> damage<00:04:44.180> that<00:04:44.360> been

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
better picture of the damage that been

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.050 
better picture of the damage that been
sustained<00:04:45.170> on<00:04:45.350> these<00:04:45.470> on<00:04:45.680> their<00:04:45.830> main<00:04:46.060> damaged

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:22.160

how injured he actually was me or him

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.740 
how injured he actually was me or him
but<00:07:25.370> we've<00:07:25.940> already<00:07:26.210> did<00:07:26.419> a<00:07:26.449> run<00:07:26.600> at<00:07:26.720> that

but we've already did a run at that

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:28.180 
but we've already did a run at that

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:28.190 
stage so that would have been the second

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:32.140 
stage so that would have been the second
run<00:07:28.280> after<00:07:28.550> the<00:07:28.639> accident<00:07:28.970> and<00:07:29.620> it<00:07:30.620> was<00:07:30.770> um<00:07:31.150> it

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:32.150
