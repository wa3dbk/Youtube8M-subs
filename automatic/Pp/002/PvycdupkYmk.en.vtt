rikon<00:00:39.420> being<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:40.020> fictional<00:00:40.410> character<00:00:40.800> that

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
rikon being the fictional character that

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.830 
rikon being the fictional character that
I<00:00:40.950> created<00:00:41.399> in<00:00:41.610> my<00:00:41.640> Dragon<00:00:42.120> Ball<00:00:42.239> Z<00:00:42.360> universe

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
I created in my Dragon Ball Z universe

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.959 
I created in my Dragon Ball Z universe
being<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.469> son<00:00:43.649> of<00:00:43.680> broli<00:00:44.040> I<00:00:44.399> don't<00:00:44.700> think

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
being the son of broli I don't think

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.819 
being the son of broli I don't think
rikon<00:00:45.629> would<00:00:45.809> stand<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.200> chance<00:00:46.410> at<00:00:46.680> this

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
rikon would stand the chance at this

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.270 
rikon would stand the chance at this
base<00:00:47.100> level<00:00:48.170> rikon<00:00:49.170> pretty<00:00:49.500> much<00:00:49.770> when<00:00:50.160> he

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
base level rikon pretty much when he

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.549 
base level rikon pretty much when he
goes<00:00:50.489> Super<00:00:50.879> Saiyan<00:00:51.120> 3<00:00:51.210> he's<00:00:51.690> equivalent<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.530> a

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
goes Super Saiyan 3 he's equivalent to a

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.580 
goes Super Saiyan 3 he's equivalent to a
super<00:00:53.190> vegeto<00:00:53.670> but<00:00:54.270> fighting<00:00:54.989> on<00:00:55.230> Super

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
super vegeto but fighting on Super

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.650 
super vegeto but fighting on Super
Saiyan<00:00:55.860> 4<00:00:56.039> go<00:00:56.219> Gina's<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.610> massacre<00:00:57.239> of<00:00:57.270> itself

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
Saiyan 4 go Gina's a massacre of itself

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.720 
Saiyan 4 go Gina's a massacre of itself
so<00:00:57.899> I<00:00:57.930> think<00:00:58.079> I<00:00:58.530> think<00:00:58.800> definitely<00:00:59.219> Gogeta

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
so I think I think definitely Gogeta

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.029 
so I think I think definitely Gogeta
would<00:00:59.910> win<00:01:00.120> even<00:01:00.539> if<00:01:00.960> rikon<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:01.500> able<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.859> pull

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
would win even if rikon is able to pull

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.529 
would win even if rikon is able to pull
off<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.219> spear<00:01:02.640> bomb<00:01:02.879> or<00:01:03.090> something<00:01:03.359> like<00:01:03.449> that

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
off a spear bomb or something like that

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.660 
off a spear bomb or something like that
I<00:01:03.899> doubt<00:01:04.409> that<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.710> will<00:01:04.830> have<00:01:04.979> such<00:01:05.280> an<00:01:05.400> effect

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
I doubt that it will have such an effect

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.370 
I doubt that it will have such an effect
that<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:06.000> did<00:01:06.119> on<00:01:06.240> everybody<00:01:06.570> else<00:01:06.780> but<00:01:06.990> let<00:01:07.290> me

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
that it did on everybody else but let me

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.450

it's<00:02:27.180> always<00:02:27.390> a<00:02:27.420> question<00:02:27.720> you<00:02:28.019> know<00:02:28.110> what<00:02:28.349> if

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
it's always a question you know what if

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.620 
it's always a question you know what if
Rowley<00:02:28.920> did<00:02:29.160> have<00:02:29.310> a<00:02:29.340> son<00:02:29.640> you<00:02:30.090> know<00:02:30.209> he<00:02:30.450> would

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
Rowley did have a son you know he would

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.050

be<00:02:30.660> 10<00:02:31.500> times<00:02:31.530> more<00:02:32.069> evil<00:02:32.280> than<00:02:32.459> Broly<00:02:32.819> he

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
be 10 times more evil than Broly he

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.600 
be 10 times more evil than Broly he
would<00:02:33.150> be<00:02:33.239> 10<00:02:33.420> times<00:02:33.450> more<00:02:33.810> stronger<00:02:34.560> so<00:02:34.830> it

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
would be 10 times more stronger so it

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:36.949 
would be 10 times more stronger so it
just<00:02:35.849> it<00:02:36.000> just<00:02:36.030> goes<00:02:36.390> where<00:02:36.569> I<00:02:36.630> was<00:02:36.750> showing

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959
