with these amazing new colors for their
cream<00:00:20.580> lip<00:00:20.789> stains<00:00:21.060> I<00:00:21.300> had<00:00:21.449> always<00:00:21.750> been<00:00:21.990> a

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
cream lip stains I had always been a

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.800 
cream lip stains I had always been a
massive<00:00:22.590> massive<00:00:22.800> fan<00:00:23.279> of<00:00:23.310> their<00:00:23.880> cream<00:00:24.630> lip

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
massive massive fan of their cream lip

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.300 
massive massive fan of their cream lip
stains<00:00:25.080> and<00:00:25.230> I<00:00:25.260> just<00:00:25.470> think<00:00:25.619> they<00:00:25.740> have<00:00:25.949> such<00:00:26.279> a

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
stains and I just think they have such a

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.970 
stains and I just think they have such a
good<00:00:26.580> formula<00:00:26.910> it's<00:00:27.300> so<00:00:27.539> creamy<00:00:27.930> and<00:00:28.230> it<00:00:28.769> dries

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
good formula it's so creamy and it dries

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.370 
good formula it's so creamy and it dries
to<00:00:29.010> a<00:00:29.220> total<00:00:29.640> not<00:00:29.789> finish<00:00:30.179> it<00:00:30.599> does<00:00:30.779> not<00:00:30.960> dry<00:00:31.199> my

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
to a total not finish it does not dry my

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.639 
to a total not finish it does not dry my
lips<00:00:31.560> as<00:00:31.800> much<00:00:32.009> as<00:00:32.219> other<00:00:32.489> lip<00:00:32.759> stains<00:00:33.059> do<00:00:33.649> and

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
lips as much as other lip stains do and

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.830 
lips as much as other lip stains do and
it<00:00:35.430> just<00:00:35.610> lasts<00:00:35.850> so<00:00:36.090> well<00:00:36.300> throughout<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.690> day

402 classic beige which they

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.940 
402 classic beige which they

lost<00:01:46.280> it<00:01:46.610> incidentally<00:01:47.390> and<00:01:47.660> all<00:01:48.110> great<00:01:48.350> they

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.410 
lost it incidentally and all great they

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.790 
lost it incidentally and all great they
you<00:01:49.190> know<00:01:49.310> stopped<00:01:50.240> producing<00:01:50.570> that<00:01:50.869> color<00:01:51.200> so

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800 
you know stopped producing that color so

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.910 
you know stopped producing that color so
I<00:01:52.670> still<00:01:53.540> think<00:01:53.780> this<00:01:53.840> is<00:01:53.900> very<00:01:54.170> nice<00:01:54.530> it's

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
I still think this is very nice it's

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.280 
I still think this is very nice it's
just<00:01:55.130> that<00:01:55.310> one<00:01:55.490> is<00:01:55.610> obviously<00:01:56.090> more<00:01:56.450> beige

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
just that one is obviously more beige

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.880 
just that one is obviously more beige
and<00:01:57.680> this<00:01:57.860> is<00:01:58.070> definitely<00:01:58.280> a<00:01:58.670> pinkish<00:01:59.330> nude

obviously in the new colors I definitely

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.030 
obviously in the new colors I definitely
do<00:03:43.280> like<00:03:43.310> it<00:03:43.730> it's<00:03:43.850> just<00:03:44.060> that<00:03:44.180> it<00:03:44.300> took<00:03:44.450> two

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
do like it it's just that it took two

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.729 
do like it it's just that it took two
coats<00:03:46.040> of<00:03:46.250> this<00:03:46.459> to<00:03:46.819> get<00:03:47.000> this<00:03:47.239> color<00:03:47.569> and<00:03:47.870> it

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
coats of this to get this color and it

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:49.870 
coats of this to get this color and it
makes<00:03:48.890> me<00:03:49.010> think<00:03:49.220> that<00:03:49.250> there's<00:03:49.520> something

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
makes me think that there's something

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.309 
makes me think that there's something
different<00:03:50.060> in<00:03:50.540> the<00:03:50.900> way<00:03:50.989> that<00:03:51.200> they

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 
different in the way that they

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:53.350 
different in the way that they
formulated<00:03:51.890> this<00:03:52.069> I<00:03:52.280> generally<00:03:53.060> think<00:03:53.090> it's

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
formulated this I generally think it's

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.270 
formulated this I generally think it's
harder<00:03:53.720> to<00:03:53.840> find<00:03:54.080> it<00:03:54.230> opaque<00:03:54.500> oranges<00:03:55.100> they're

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
harder to find it opaque oranges they're

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.240 
harder to find it opaque oranges they're
either<00:03:55.430> too<00:03:55.790> sheer<00:03:56.150> or<00:03:56.450> they're<00:03:56.660> too<00:03:56.989> matte<00:03:57.260> I

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
either too sheer or they're too matte I

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.220 
either too sheer or they're too matte I
definitely<00:03:59.000> do<00:03:59.180> like<00:03:59.209> the<00:03:59.630> color<00:03:59.840> that<00:04:00.080> this

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
definitely do like the color that this

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:01.870 
definitely do like the color that this
is<00:04:00.440> bringing<00:04:00.620> out<00:04:00.950> I'm<00:04:01.160> just<00:04:01.220> worried<00:04:01.670> about

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
is bringing out I'm just worried about

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.400 
is bringing out I'm just worried about
it<00:04:02.060> getting<00:04:02.239> a<00:04:02.390> little<00:04:02.420> more<00:04:02.810> dry<00:04:03.140> because

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
it getting a little more dry because

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.920 
it getting a little more dry because
you're<00:04:03.769> putting<00:04:04.070> two<00:04:04.310> layers<00:04:04.580> on<00:04:04.910> as<00:04:05.510> opposed

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
you're putting two layers on as opposed

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.570 
you're putting two layers on as opposed
to<00:04:06.019> one<00:04:06.290> so<00:04:06.500> that's<00:04:06.620> going<00:04:06.890> to<00:04:06.950> be<00:04:07.070> make<00:04:07.400> your

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
to one so that's going to be make your

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.240 
to one so that's going to be make your
lips<00:04:07.760> a<00:04:07.880> little<00:04:08.000> more<00:04:08.330> dry<00:04:08.630> otherwise<00:04:09.590> I<00:04:10.130> do

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
lips a little more dry otherwise I do

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.460 
lips a little more dry otherwise I do
really<00:04:10.670> like<00:04:10.880> that<00:04:10.940> so<00:04:11.750> the<00:04:11.840> last<00:04:11.930> color<00:04:12.200> is

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
really like that so the last color is

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.650 
really like that so the last color is
the<00:04:12.739> number<00:04:12.950> fifteen<00:04:13.400> polished<00:04:13.970> purple<00:04:14.390> and

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
the number fifteen polished purple and

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.960 
the number fifteen polished purple and
this<00:04:15.380> is<00:04:15.440> the<00:04:15.620> darkest<00:04:15.980> color<00:04:16.010> that<00:04:16.549> they<00:04:16.730> came

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
this is the darkest color that they came

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.250 
this is the darkest color that they came
out<00:04:17.269> with<00:04:18.340> it<00:04:19.340> took<00:04:19.760> three<00:04:20.000> coats<00:04:20.269> for<00:04:20.780> it<00:04:21.019> to

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
out with it took three coats for it to

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.200 
out with it took three coats for it to
get<00:04:21.410> to<00:04:21.470> this<00:04:21.919> color<00:04:22.250> because<00:04:22.520> it<00:04:22.790> is<00:04:22.820> a<00:04:22.940> little

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
get to this color because it is a little

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.900 
get to this color because it is a little
bit<00:04:23.419> sheer<00:04:23.780> it's<00:04:24.410> not<00:04:24.650> exactly<00:04:25.130> that<00:04:25.460> when<00:04:25.760> it

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
bit sheer it's not exactly that when it

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.820 
bit sheer it's not exactly that when it
dries<00:04:26.090> I<00:04:26.570> mean<00:04:26.750> the<00:04:26.840> feel<00:04:27.050> of<00:04:27.080> it<00:04:27.350> isn't<00:04:27.710> that

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
dries I mean the feel of it isn't that

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.700 
dries I mean the feel of it isn't that
but<00:04:28.220> if<00:04:28.430> you<00:04:28.580> like<00:04:28.790> from<00:04:28.970> that<00:04:29.000> look<00:04:29.510> then<00:04:30.169> this

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
but if you like from that look then this

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.010 
but if you like from that look then this
does<00:04:31.190> not<00:04:31.370> do<00:04:31.610> that<00:04:31.790> because<00:04:32.060> it<00:04:32.390> has<00:04:32.570> more<00:04:32.870> of

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
does not do that because it has more of

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.200 
does not do that because it has more of
it<00:04:33.260> kind<00:04:33.500> of<00:04:33.650> has<00:04:33.860> little<00:04:34.220> specks<00:04:34.610> in<00:04:34.820> it<00:04:34.940> which

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
it kind of has little specks in it which

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.890 
it kind of has little specks in it which
show<00:04:36.460> it's<00:04:37.460> important<00:04:37.970> to<00:04:38.030> know<00:04:38.180> that<00:04:38.479> these

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
show it's important to know that these

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.980 
show it's important to know that these
lip<00:04:39.169> stains<00:04:39.500> ask<00:04:40.280> to<00:04:40.520> get<00:04:40.700> more<00:04:41.120> dry<00:04:41.419> they<00:04:41.780> get

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
lip stains ask to get more dry they get

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.650 
lip stains ask to get more dry they get
a<00:04:42.020> little<00:04:42.289> bit<00:04:42.560> darker<00:04:43.039> so<00:04:43.280> you<00:04:44.180> need<00:04:44.479> to

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
a little bit darker so you need to

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.180 
a little bit darker so you need to
assess<00:04:45.020> the<00:04:45.200> color<00:04:45.440> right<00:04:45.650> then<00:04:45.860> like<00:04:46.010> when<00:04:46.160> I

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
assess the color right then like when I

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:47.770 
assess the color right then like when I
put<00:04:46.400> this<00:04:46.490> color<00:04:46.700> on<00:04:46.789> initially<00:04:47.419> I<00:04:47.450> was<00:04:47.660> like

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
put this color on initially I was like

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.240 
put this color on initially I was like
okay<00:04:48.050> this<00:04:48.169> does<00:04:48.350> not<00:04:48.530> look<00:04:48.770> like<00:04:48.800> the<00:04:49.070> color

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
okay this does not look like the color

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.580 
okay this does not look like the color
in<00:04:49.430> the<00:04:49.520> tube<00:04:49.760> it<00:04:50.030> is<00:04:50.150> so<00:04:50.360> light<00:04:50.630> but<00:04:50.930> now<00:04:51.440> it

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
in the tube it is so light but now it

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.820 
in the tube it is so light but now it
has<00:04:51.620> actually<00:04:52.070> become<00:04:52.220> that<00:04:52.729> exact<00:04:53.060> color<00:04:53.830> so

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
has actually become that exact color so

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.540
