 scorer for his team with 12 points 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.790

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.790
 16 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.260
 then a three-point shot from lamar 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.450
 gives more to vernon besides this 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.940
 will be the last because the teammates of the

 an imprecise pass lemazurier offers a 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:45.600
 possibility to Vernon initiated by secret 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:47.010

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.040
 two minutes from the end of third 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.050
 quarter time the nvb lead 29 to 9 which 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.730
 means that reds do not have 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:57.090

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.500
