00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
way I could exclude Alakazam from this

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.250 
way I could exclude Alakazam from this
list<00:04:23.040> and<00:04:23.250> that's<00:04:23.550> why<00:04:23.850> he<00:04:24.120> makes<00:04:24.390> it<00:04:24.600> as<00:04:24.720> one

range in other words it can communicate

range in other words it can communicate
just<00:04:41.190> like<00:04:41.430> a<00:04:41.460> human<00:04:41.910> using<00:04:42.450> our<00:04:42.600> language<00:04:43.080> to

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
just like a human using our language to

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.680 
just like a human using our language to
do<00:04:43.620> so<00:04:43.830> your<00:04:44.190> average<00:04:44.310> slow<00:04:44.730> King<00:04:44.940> is<00:04:45.120> actually

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
do so your average slow King is actually

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.780 
do so your average slow King is actually
more<00:04:45.990> intelligent<00:04:46.710> than<00:04:46.890> your<00:04:47.070> average<00:04:47.190> human

other Pokemon can understand what we're

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.530 
other Pokemon can understand what we're
saying<00:04:49.650> but<00:04:50.310> slow<00:04:50.550> King<00:04:50.820> can<00:04:51.030> respond<00:04:51.420> with

saying but slow King can respond with

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.170 
saying but slow King can respond with
the<00:04:51.840> same<00:04:51.870> if<00:04:52.320> not<00:04:52.800> more<00:04:52.860> wisdom<00:04:53.520> than<00:04:53.850> your

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
the same if not more wisdom than your

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.240 
the same if not more wisdom than your

average person now that's smart and

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.310 
average person now that's smart and
that's<00:04:56.610> why<00:04:56.790> slow<00:04:57.090> king<00:04:57.330> is<00:04:57.510> number<00:04:57.810> three<00:04:58.110> on

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
that's why slow king is number three on

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.280 
that's why slow king is number three on
this<00:04:58.680> list<00:04:58.980> number<00:04:59.610> two<00:04:59.820> oopsie<00:05:00.540> oopsie<00:05:00.750> is
