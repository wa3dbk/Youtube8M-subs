00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.300
 You must know that it's like 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.539
 the use of hashish is Japanese and hashim 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.980
 shrinking will flame in Portuguese 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.619
 it's small, right? 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.630
 was one of the readers that asked and I 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.550
 I was thinking, there must be other people. 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.189
 who have the same question same 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.260
 then how about teaching the 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.570
 correct manner or at least in the manner 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.320
 that I learned then for who wants 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.170
 learn 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.770
 stay tuned I have four here to 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.629
 Tim this one is iron. 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.860
 these attacks are most commonly used in 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:52.379
 Korean sensors are good, it's iron 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:56.100
 this is also iron was heavier 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:58.199
 okay and has this digest size quadradinho 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.410
 here is the bamboo that optimizes for 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.470
 cooking and here is also that you 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:08.100
 you find in the restaurant that this is 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.020
 of bamboo but tends wood places in the 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.860
 half to use that always comes 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.140
 inside a little bag there let's teach 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.750
 the step by step of the first thing you 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.390
 will get one of the palettiins as if you 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:26.189
 to write you write like this 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:28.979
 where you safe here in the not 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:33.980
 very noted do not like in 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:37.550
 low but less 80% here is so too 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:42.650
 and another wine the other breath already came 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:44.930
 here below and he will lean on 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.780
 thumb and in the ring 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:53.630
 now this beautiful one up here will stay 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:55.850
 it will stay between your three fingers and you 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.260
 will make this move to insure a 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.260
 object 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:03.230
 Well I hope this down stick 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:06.800
 He stands for it and you just 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:08.600
 move the talent from above, it's a question 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.130
 of much training 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.620
 [Music] 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.630
 in the beginning it will be difficult and I found 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:23.590
 as it will be difficult to show 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:29.860
 that my hand left the supporter should 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.860
 happen and you will end up doing this 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:38.610
 [Music] 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:40.870
 I was stopped is he lives the same 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:44.980
 that I'm not used to as a 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:48.489
 around but over time the opel can 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:51.470
 quite let try to get that beans 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:57.190
 beans have institution 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:03:00.010
 [Music] 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.920
 you wind up losing strength and you drop 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.739
 this way I 'm showing you the 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:11.769
 Right, I make this name super good. 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:14.440
 super ténéré profiles with training more 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:17.970
 can catch with the right hand is well 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.970
 easier and just right 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:26.609
 I've seen people holding this way. 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:30.420
 supported here on the middle finger 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:32.340
 holding with both ends making 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.769
 this movement only with these 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.469
 two devices but I do not feel much 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:41.239
 security very firmly know is that in this 

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:46.799
 At the moment there are people who also 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:48.659
 people who support the 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:53.489
 beautiful to make a move 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:58.650
 the media is too short 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:04:02.219
 Anyway , there are people who 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:06.150
 hand to hold a little stick like this 

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:08.639
 I find it very difficult to do so because 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.409
 when it is not closed from or 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:13.859
 stay very long here you go 

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:16.560
 lose what he and I think I do not 

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:19.289
 I can do this because I'm very tired 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:23.009
 here the joint should also leave 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:24.750
 close right tip the correct or incorrect 

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:29.040
 the most popular right 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:32.640
 reject this format 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.270
 the bag is a matter of training people 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.950
 OK 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:39.290
 I hope you trust I hope that 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:39.290
 You liked it and until the next
