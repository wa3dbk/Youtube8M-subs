ipad application number one is seeing

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.029 
ipad application number one is seeing
our<00:00:47.940> design<00:00:48.359> sort<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:48.870> come<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.260> life<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.710> how

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
our design sort of come to life and how

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.979 
our design sort of come to life and how
users<00:00:50.550> interact<00:00:50.579> with<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.420> it's<00:00:51.870> the

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
users interact with it it's the

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.259 
users interact with it it's the
interactivity<00:00:52.530> without<00:00:53.429> even<00:00:53.699> realizing

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:54.269 
interactivity without even realizing

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:55.849 
interactivity without even realizing
there's<00:00:54.420> interactivity<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.559> know<00:00:55.649> that's

00:00:55.849 --> 00:00:55.859 
there's interactivity you know that's

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:57.590 
there's interactivity you know that's
the<00:00:56.039> sweet<00:00:56.370> spot<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:56.760> think<00:00:57.089> we<00:00:57.179> want<00:00:57.359> to<00:00:57.449> hit

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
the sweet spot I think we want to hit

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.869 
the sweet spot I think we want to hit
because<00:00:57.989> we<00:00:58.379> can<00:00:58.559> connect<00:00:58.979> you<00:00:59.159> so<00:00:59.579> deep<00:00:59.850> so

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
designing for it is the idea that there

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.499 
designing for it is the idea that there
is<00:01:37.259> no<00:01:37.409> wrong<00:01:37.590> way<00:01:37.649> to<00:01:37.829> hold<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.509> that's
