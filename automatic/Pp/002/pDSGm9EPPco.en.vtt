00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
memories were not I just think that

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.009 
memories were not I just think that
quote<00:00:41.160> sums<00:00:41.430> up<00:00:41.580> the<00:00:41.699> entire<00:00:41.790> story<00:00:42.390> so<00:00:42.750> well

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:43.019 
quote sums up the entire story so well

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:44.570 
quote sums up the entire story so well
so<00:00:43.559> let's<00:00:43.739> get<00:00:43.860> started<00:00:44.160> with<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.400> project

using<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.850> marker<00:01:03.149> here<00:01:03.450> so<00:01:03.660> that<00:01:03.809> you<00:01:03.930> can<00:01:04.140> see

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:04.410 
using a marker here so that you can see

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.350 
using a marker here so that you can see
what<00:01:04.589> I'm<00:01:04.710> doing<00:01:05.039> on<00:01:05.220> camera<00:01:05.729> but<00:01:06.210> you'll

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
what I'm doing on camera but you'll

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.180 
what I'm doing on camera but you'll
actually<00:01:06.570> want<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:07.050> use<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.229> pencil<00:01:07.590> so<00:01:08.039> that

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
actually want to use a pencil so that

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:09.740 
actually want to use a pencil so that
your<00:01:08.310> buildings<00:01:08.670> don't<00:01:08.850> have<00:01:09.090> black<00:01:09.330> edges

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
your buildings don't have black edges

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.840 
your buildings don't have black edges
I'm<00:01:10.020> switching<00:01:10.920> up<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.100> heights<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.640> the

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
I'm switching up the heights and the

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.060 
I'm switching up the heights and the
shapes<00:01:12.060> of<00:01:12.240> my<00:01:12.360> buildings<00:01:12.780> as<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:13.170> go<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.619> I'm

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
shapes of my buildings as I go and I'm

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.160 
shapes of my buildings as I go and I'm
also<00:01:14.310> making<00:01:14.430> sure<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:15.210> only<00:01:15.420> make<00:01:15.720> buildings

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
also making sure to only make buildings

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.920 
also making sure to only make buildings
out<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.380> text<00:01:16.890> not<00:01:17.310> pictures<00:01:17.759> this<00:01:18.540> isn't

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
out of text not pictures this isn't

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.330 
out of text not pictures this isn't
essential<00:01:19.200> but<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.560> think<00:01:19.830> that<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.040> makes<00:01:20.220> the

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
essential but I think that it makes the

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.950 
essential but I think that it makes the
final<00:01:20.520> piece<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:20.970> art<00:01:21.150> look<00:01:21.420> much<00:01:21.720> more

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
final piece of art look much more

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.740 
final piece of art look much more
cohesive<00:01:22.729> once<00:01:23.729> you<00:01:23.880> have<00:01:24.000> several<00:01:24.330> buildings

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
cohesive once you have several buildings

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.910 
cohesive once you have several buildings
cut<00:01:25.110> them<00:01:25.260> out<00:01:26.689> again<00:01:27.689> I'm<00:01:28.170> cutting<00:01:28.560> off<00:01:28.680> any

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
cut them out again I'm cutting off any

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.100 
cut them out again I'm cutting off any
pieces<00:01:29.250> that<00:01:29.670> don't<00:01:29.909> have<00:01:30.210> text

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.810 

this<00:01:35.110> is<00:01:35.380> the<00:01:35.710> picture<00:01:35.890> frame<00:01:36.160> backing<00:01:36.520> I'm

this is the picture frame backing I'm

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.120 
this is the picture frame backing I'm
using<00:01:37.390> it<00:01:37.630> to<00:01:37.750> determine<00:01:38.050> how<00:01:38.410> much<00:01:38.560> cardstock

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
using it to determine how much cardstock

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.340 
using it to determine how much cardstock
I'll<00:01:39.340> need<00:01:39.490> for<00:01:39.790> the<00:01:39.850> background<00:01:40.240> I<00:01:40.540> used<00:01:41.050> four

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
I'll need for the background I used four

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.140 
I'll need for the background I used four
sheets<00:01:41.620> of<00:01:41.800> eight-and-a-half<00:01:42.430> by<00:01:42.640> 11<00:01:43.000> inch

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
cardstock there's a lot of overlap but

cardstock there's a lot of overlap but

now it's time to lay down all of the
buildings<00:01:59.270> I<00:01:59.540> tried<00:02:00.260> to<00:02:00.380> alternate<00:02:00.770> between

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
buildings I tried to alternate between

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.190 
buildings I tried to alternate between
different<00:02:01.400> heights<00:02:01.670> and<00:02:01.940> shapes<00:02:02.270> and<00:02:02.510> as<00:02:03.050> you

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
different heights and shapes and as you

different heights and shapes and as you
can<00:02:03.320> see<00:02:03.560> I'm<00:02:03.830> using<00:02:03.860> the<00:02:04.280> buildings<00:02:04.670> to<00:02:04.760> cover

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
can see I'm using the buildings to cover

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.820 
can see I'm using the buildings to cover
up<00:02:05.240> that<00:02:05.270> weird<00:02:05.690> line<00:02:05.960> where<00:02:06.260> the<00:02:06.350> two<00:02:06.380> pieces

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
up that weird line where the two pieces

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.770 
up that weird line where the two pieces
of<00:02:06.860> cardstock<00:02:07.250> meet<00:02:07.700> I<00:02:08.000> started<00:02:08.540> with<00:02:08.630> 10

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
of cardstock meet I started with 10

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.690 
of cardstock meet I started with 10
buildings<00:02:09.140> but<00:02:09.470> this<00:02:09.650> left<00:02:09.950> a<00:02:10.070> little<00:02:10.280> gap<00:02:10.520> at

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
buildings but this left a little gap at

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.120 
buildings but this left a little gap at
the<00:02:10.729> end<00:02:10.820> so<00:02:11.600> I<00:02:11.630> replaced<00:02:12.050> one<00:02:12.260> of<00:02:12.290> them<00:02:12.560> with<00:02:12.890> a

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
the end so I replaced one of them with a

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.950 
the end so I replaced one of them with a
slightly<00:02:13.400> wider<00:02:13.730> building<00:02:14.270> once<00:02:14.750> you're

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
slightly wider building once you're

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.780 
slightly wider building once you're
