00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
roll stability of handling

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.930 
roll stability of handling
maneuverability<00:01:29.530> in<00:01:29.800> all<00:01:30.340> in<00:01:30.520> one<00:01:30.700> package

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 
maneuverability in all in one package

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.740 
maneuverability in all in one package
and<00:01:31.390> by<00:01:31.720> really<00:01:32.350> taking<00:01:33.130> these<00:01:33.360> really<00:01:34.360> fun<00:01:34.630> to

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
and by really taking these really fun to

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.540 
and by really taking these really fun to
drive<00:01:34.929> attributes<00:01:35.530> of<00:01:35.710> the<00:01:35.770> Giulietta<00:01:36.280> and

customizing to fit the dart and the

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:42.870 
customizing to fit the dart and the
American<00:01:41.259> roads<00:01:41.500> I<00:01:41.830> think<00:01:42.160> we've<00:01:42.280> got<00:01:42.459> really

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
American roads I think we've got really

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.920 
American roads I think we've got really
a<00:01:42.910> great<00:01:43.300> car<00:01:43.600> to<00:01:43.720> drive

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
a great car to drive

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.810 

because<00:01:46.930> we<00:01:47.110> have<00:01:47.290> a<00:01:47.320> variety<00:01:47.860> of<00:01:48.130> gasoline

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
because we have a variety of gasoline

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.480 
because we have a variety of gasoline
power<00:01:49.090> trains<00:01:49.480> were<00:01:49.990> able<00:01:50.410> to<00:01:50.680> really

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
power trains were able to really

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.240 
power trains were able to really
optimize<00:01:51.640> both<00:01:52.330> performance<00:01:53.250> affordability

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
optimize both performance affordability

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.090 
optimize both performance affordability
and<00:01:54.670> fuel<00:01:55.330> economy<00:01:55.450> and<00:01:55.960> really<00:01:56.650> offer<00:01:56.830> the

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
and fuel economy and really offer the

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.030 
and fuel economy and really offer the
customer<00:01:57.280> a<00:01:58.210> whole<00:01:58.840> host<00:01:59.110> of<00:01:59.320> combinations

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
customer a whole host of combinations

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.100 
customer a whole host of combinations
depending<00:02:00.190> on<00:02:00.610> what<00:02:00.790> they<00:02:00.940> want<00:02:01.240> in<00:02:01.900> addition

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
depending on what they want in addition

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.530 
depending on what they want in addition
to<00:02:02.350> the<00:02:02.470> arrow<00:02:02.680> model<00:02:03.130> that<00:02:03.340> yields<00:02:03.820> 41<00:02:04.300> miles

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
to the arrow model that yields 41 miles

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.050 
to the arrow model that yields 41 miles
per<00:02:04.780> gallon<00:02:05.160> we<00:02:06.160> have<00:02:06.370> I'll<00:02:06.580> say<00:02:06.760> a<00:02:06.790> very

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
per gallon we have I'll say a very

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.960 
per gallon we have I'll say a very
normal<00:02:07.420> package<00:02:08.080> of<00:02:08.380> the<00:02:08.680> 1.4<00:02:09.310> liter<00:02:09.580> engine

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
normal package of the 1.4 liter engine

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.820 
normal package of the 1.4 liter engine
that<00:02:10.150> yields<00:02:10.540> 39<00:02:11.020> miles<00:02:11.260> per<00:02:11.500> gallon<00:02:11.680> highway

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
that yields 39 miles per gallon highway

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.040 
that yields 39 miles per gallon highway
so<00:02:12.400> there's<00:02:13.000> not<00:02:13.180> a<00:02:13.240> large<00:02:13.690> difference

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
so there's not a large difference

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.000 
so there's not a large difference
between<00:02:14.590> the<00:02:14.710> two<00:02:15.180> but<00:02:16.180> we<00:02:16.450> think<00:02:16.660> that

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
between the two but we think that

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.790 
between the two but we think that
offering<00:02:18.010> our<00:02:18.190> customers<00:02:18.370> really<00:02:18.910> a<00:02:19.870> host<00:02:20.530> of

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
offering our customers really a host of

offering our customers really a host of
combinations<00:02:21.670> of<00:02:21.790> fuel<00:02:22.060> economy<00:02:22.540> and

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
combinations of fuel economy and

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.160 
combinations of fuel economy and
affordability<00:02:23.170> and<00:02:23.530> content<00:02:24.780> really<00:02:25.780> covers
