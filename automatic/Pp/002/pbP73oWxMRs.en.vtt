00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
it was worth it that sets maybe my

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.460 
it was worth it that sets maybe my
competitive<00:05:13.440> side<00:05:14.400> that<00:05:14.820> is<00:05:14.940> nice<00:05:15.750> talking

oh<00:05:28.199> ok<00:05:29.199> have<00:05:29.379> an<00:05:29.530> idea<00:05:29.800> this<00:05:30.520> is<00:05:30.669> why<00:05:30.940> i<00:05:30.970> don't

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180 
oh ok have an idea this is why i don't

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.629 
oh ok have an idea this is why i don't
really<00:05:31.599> like<00:05:31.690> I<00:05:32.020> used<00:05:32.680> to<00:05:32.800> don't<00:05:33.250> like<00:05:33.490> the

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:33.639 
really like I used to don't like the

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:37.140 
really like I used to don't like the
soul<00:05:34.050> it's<00:05:35.050> really<00:05:35.830> because<00:05:36.129> it's<00:05:36.759> as<00:05:36.909> much

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
soul it's really because it's as much

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.129 
soul it's really because it's as much
with<00:05:37.509> more<00:05:37.750> recoil<00:05:38.139> to<00:05:38.550> send<00:05:39.550> miss<00:05:40.150> rate<00:05:40.990> of

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:41.139 
with more recoil to send miss rate of

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:44.839 
with more recoil to send miss rate of
fire<00:05:41.319> but<00:05:41.560> way<00:05:42.129> much<00:05:42.430> more<00:05:42.460> recoil<00:05:43.030> since<00:05:43.840> the

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:44.849 
fire but way much more recoil since the

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:48.330 
fire but way much more recoil since the
PKM<00:05:45.849> and<00:05:46.030> the<00:05:46.180> mg36<00:05:46.720> you<00:05:47.530> can<00:05:47.680> see<00:05:47.889> the<00:05:48.009> revised

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:48.340 
PKM and the mg36 you can see the revised
