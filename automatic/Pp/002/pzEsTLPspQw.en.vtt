00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
minute why that is this is kind of like

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.650 
minute why that is this is kind of like
a<00:03:12.680> faux<00:03:13.010> leather<00:03:13.250> that<00:03:13.820> they<00:03:13.970> put<00:03:14.150> on<00:03:14.209> or<00:03:14.420> maybe

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
a faux leather that they put on or maybe

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.440 
a faux leather that they put on or maybe
real<00:03:15.050> other<00:03:15.230> but<00:03:15.470> I<00:03:15.500> think<00:03:15.650> it's<00:03:15.769> fake<00:03:15.980> and

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
real other but I think it's fake and

real other but I think it's fake and
works<00:03:17.450> great

a long time ago and that's when they

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.280 
a long time ago and that's when they
didn't<00:03:42.880> have<00:03:43.000> the<00:03:43.090> likeness<00:03:43.450> right<00:03:43.690> so<00:03:44.020> the

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
didn't have the likeness right so the

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.470 
didn't have the likeness right so the
face<00:03:44.500> looked<00:03:44.770> completely<00:03:44.830> different<00:03:45.340> and<00:03:46.060> it

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
face looked completely different and it

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.030 
face looked completely different and it
was<00:03:46.510> still<00:03:46.780> cool<00:03:46.990> everyone's<00:03:47.440> excited<00:03:47.710> about

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
it but just wasn't there so they made

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:57.440 
it but just wasn't there so they made
another<00:03:56.260> one<00:03:56.650> they<00:03:56.800> finally<00:03:57.130> got<00:03:57.250> the

tongue-tied<00:04:00.010> there<00:04:00.460> and<00:04:01.230> came<00:04:02.230> up<00:04:02.380> with<00:04:02.410> a

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
tongue-tied there and came up with a

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.680 
tongue-tied there and came up with a
better<00:04:02.710> sculpt<00:04:03.310> but<00:04:03.700> then<00:04:03.880> they<00:04:04.000> said<00:04:04.180> we're

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690

mobility<00:05:07.839> here's<00:05:08.709> the<00:05:08.889> head<00:05:09.659> he<00:05:10.659> can't<00:05:10.929> turn

00:05:11.489 --> 00:05:11.499 
mobility here's the head he can't turn

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:13.350 
mobility here's the head he can't turn
like<00:05:11.709> this<00:05:11.889> so<00:05:12.249> really<00:05:12.459> like<00:05:12.699> this<00:05:12.939> it's<00:05:13.270> just

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
like this so really like this it's just

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.409 
like this so really like this it's just
really<00:05:13.719> standard<00:05:14.199> because<00:05:14.469> of<00:05:14.619> the<00:05:14.709> neck<00:05:15.419> one

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:16.419 
really standard because of the neck one

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:17.669 
really standard because of the neck one
thing<00:05:16.569> you<00:05:16.629> won't<00:05:16.719> be<00:05:16.839> careful<00:05:17.229> which<00:05:17.379> is<00:05:17.529> one

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:17.679 
thing you won't be careful which is one

00:05:17.679 --> 00:05:20.339 
thing you won't be careful which is one
of<00:05:17.770> the<00:05:17.830> first<00:05:18.009> things<00:05:18.129> I<00:05:18.399> did<00:05:18.429> was<00:05:19.110> push<00:05:20.110> down

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:20.349 
of the first things I did was push down

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:23.010 
of the first things I did was push down
on<00:05:20.379> the<00:05:20.589> head<00:05:20.709> to<00:05:20.860> try<00:05:21.069> get<00:05:21.389> just<00:05:22.389> squash<00:05:22.689> more

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
on the head to try get just squash more

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.019 
on the head to try get just squash more
and<00:05:23.229> as<00:05:23.379> you<00:05:23.529> can<00:05:23.679> see<00:05:23.709> it's<00:05:24.069> left<00:05:24.249> a<00:05:24.580> little

00:05:25.019 --> 00:05:25.029 
and as you can see it's left a little

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:27.329 
and as you can see it's left a little
invitation<00:05:25.809> from<00:05:26.169> that<00:05:26.559> pressure<00:05:26.860> so<00:05:27.249> you

00:05:27.329 --> 00:05:27.339 
invitation from that pressure so you

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:30.359 
invitation from that pressure so you
might<00:05:27.490> want<00:05:27.669> to<00:05:27.759> be<00:05:27.819> careful<00:05:27.849> with<00:05:28.330> that<00:05:29.369> the

00:05:30.359 --> 00:05:30.369 
might want to be careful with that the

00:05:30.369 --> 00:05:34.350 
might want to be careful with that the
inside<00:05:30.699> of<00:05:30.759> the<00:05:30.969> head<00:05:31.740> comes<00:05:32.740> as<00:05:32.919> a<00:05:32.949> socket<00:05:33.429> and

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
inside of the head comes as a socket and

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.509 
inside of the head comes as a socket and
I<00:05:34.479> will<00:05:34.659> show<00:05:34.869> you<00:05:34.929> how<00:05:35.019> to<00:05:35.110> remove<00:05:35.559> that<00:05:35.619> one

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:36.519 
I will show you how to remove that one

00:05:36.519 --> 00:05:39.709 
I will show you how to remove that one
modification<00:05:36.909> is<00:05:37.360> to<00:05:37.509> remove<00:05:37.749> the<00:05:37.809> socket<00:05:38.349> and

00:05:39.709 --> 00:05:39.719 
modification is to remove the socket and

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:42.629 
modification is to remove the socket and
chip<00:05:40.719> away<00:05:40.749> and<00:05:41.289> cut<00:05:41.649> parts<00:05:41.979> away<00:05:42.129> to<00:05:42.279> make<00:05:42.519> the

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:42.639 
chip away and cut parts away to make the

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:45.749 
chip away and cut parts away to make the
neck<00:05:42.849> quicker<00:05:43.539> but<00:05:43.839> if<00:05:43.959> you<00:05:44.199> want<00:05:44.469> to<00:05:44.759> keep

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:48.399 
your figure in mint condition maybe fill

00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:50.730 
your figure in mint condition maybe fill
it<00:05:48.519> down<00:05:48.699> the<00:05:48.849> line<00:05:49.169> I'll<00:05:50.169> show<00:05:50.379> you<00:05:50.439> a<00:05:50.529> way<00:05:50.709> to

it down the line I'll show you a way to

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.040 
it down the line I'll show you a way to
modify<00:05:51.279> it<00:05:51.580> without<00:05:52.059> having<00:05:52.269> to<00:05:52.539> do<00:05:52.809> that

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.050 
modify it without having to do that

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.679 
modify it without having to do that
which<00:05:53.319> I<00:05:53.469> would<00:05:53.679> recommend<00:05:53.979> because<00:05:54.789> once<00:05:55.479> you

00:05:55.679 --> 00:05:55.689 
which I would recommend because once you

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:57.959 
which I would recommend because once you
cut<00:05:55.899> it<00:05:56.050> up<00:05:56.199> and<00:05:56.439> mess<00:05:56.949> it<00:05:56.979> up<00:05:57.189> he's<00:05:57.490> not<00:05:57.519> going

00:05:57.959 --> 00:05:57.969 
cut it up and mess it up he's not going

00:05:57.969 --> 00:05:59.969 
cut it up and mess it up he's not going
to<00:05:58.029> be<00:05:58.119> the<00:05:58.240> same<00:05:58.419> ever<00:05:58.689> again<00:05:58.779> unless<00:05:59.229> you

00:05:59.969 --> 00:05:59.979 
to be the same ever again unless you

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:01.920 
to be the same ever again unless you
glue<00:06:00.249> the<00:06:00.429> pieces<00:06:00.669> back<00:06:00.909> together<00:06:01.269> which<00:06:01.749> I

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 
glue the pieces back together which I

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.859 
glue the pieces back together which I
wouldn't<00:06:02.559> recommend<00:06:03.509> it's<00:06:04.509> probably<00:06:04.749> going

00:06:04.859 --> 00:06:04.869 
wouldn't recommend it's probably going

00:06:04.869 --> 00:06:07.589 
wouldn't recommend it's probably going
to<00:06:04.930> be<00:06:04.990> the<00:06:05.050> safest<00:06:05.469> way<00:06:05.800> to<00:06:05.829> do<00:06:06.159> it<00:06:06.279> and<00:06:06.599> what

00:06:07.589 --> 00:06:07.599 
to be the safest way to do it and what

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:09.689 
to be the safest way to do it and what
you'll<00:06:07.839> need<00:06:08.110> is<00:06:08.169> some<00:06:08.889> needle<00:06:09.189> nose<00:06:09.219> pliers

00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:09.699 
you'll need is some needle nose pliers

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:15.809 
you'll need is some needle nose pliers
and<00:06:10.199> a<00:06:11.199> hairdryer<00:06:12.809> so
