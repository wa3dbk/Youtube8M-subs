00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
initialization that's the american

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.890

that<00:01:26.190> this<00:01:26.400> was<00:01:26.580> a<00:01:26.610> good<00:01:26.940> idea<00:01:27.080> for<00:01:28.080> when<00:01:28.290> you

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.410 
that this was a good idea for when you

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.200 
that this was a good idea for when you
get<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.620> new<00:01:28.800> product<00:01:29.220> that<00:01:29.400> it<00:01:29.700> would<00:01:29.850> just<00:01:29.970> sit

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
get a new product that it would just sit

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.000 
get a new product that it would just sit
there<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.479> be<00:01:30.750> totally<00:01:30.990> unusable<00:01:31.470> doing<00:01:31.920> its

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.010 
there and be totally unusable doing its

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.719 
there and be totally unusable doing its
own<00:01:32.160> thing<00:01:32.190> for<00:01:32.760> seven<00:01:33.270> whole<00:01:33.450> minutes

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
own thing for seven whole minutes

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.719 
own thing for seven whole minutes
initialization<00:01:35.729> is<00:01:36.240> complete<00:01:36.720> apparently<00:01:37.729> so

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
initialization is complete apparently so

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.730 
initialization is complete apparently so
apparently<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.750> printer<00:01:40.020> can<00:01:40.229> be<00:01:40.500> used

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
apparently that the printer can be used

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.660 
apparently that the printer can be used
I<00:01:41.070> guess<00:01:42.020> until<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.290> know<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.410> next

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
I guess until you know the next

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.040 
I guess until you know the next
inevitable<00:01:44.670> error<00:01:45.150> message<00:01:45.509> tells<00:01:45.780> me<00:01:45.930> that

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
inevitable error message tells me that

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.560 
inevitable error message tells me that
it<00:01:46.140> can't<00:01:46.320> be<00:01:46.410> used<00:01:46.850> so<00:01:47.850> what<00:01:48.090> do<00:01:48.180> we<00:01:48.240> try<00:01:48.509> and

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
it can't be used so what do we try and

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:58.670 
it can't be used so what do we try and
print<00:01:48.869> something<00:01:49.170> with<00:01:49.830> our<00:01:51.110> printer<00:01:55.460> um<00:01:57.680> is

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
print something with our printer um is

print something with our printer um is

this might be it I think I may have
finally<00:03:30.250> figured<00:03:30.670> it<00:03:30.849> out<00:03:31.000> this<00:03:31.750> is<00:03:31.989> the

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
finally figured it out this is the

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.250 
finally figured it out this is the
output<00:03:32.349> tray<00:03:33.390> have<00:03:34.390> i<00:03:34.510> mentioned<00:03:34.540> i<00:03:34.959> don't<00:03:35.140> use

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
output tray have i mentioned i don't use

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.520 
output tray have i mentioned i don't use
printers<00:03:35.590> often<00:03:35.950> and<00:03:36.099> that's<00:03:36.970> i<00:03:37.330> just<00:03:37.810> true

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
printers often and that's i just true

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:39.660 
printers often and that's i just true
and<00:03:38.680> a<00:03:38.709> whole<00:03:38.799> lot<00:03:38.920> of<00:03:39.040> paper<00:03:39.220> and<00:03:39.459> pressed

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
and a whole lot of paper and pressed

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.699 
and a whole lot of paper and pressed
another<00:03:39.910> button<00:03:41.640> so<00:03:42.640> i<00:03:43.060> think<00:03:43.269> now<00:03:43.959> if<00:03:44.290> we<00:03:44.560> get

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
another button so i think now if we get

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:46.410 
another button so i think now if we get
an<00:03:44.830> error<00:03:45.010> it'll<00:03:45.370> probably<00:03:45.459> be<00:03:45.730> about<00:03:45.879> ink<00:03:46.120> or

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
an error it'll probably be about ink or

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:54.710 
an error it'll probably be about ink or
maybe<00:03:46.900> it'll<00:03:47.110> work<00:03:47.549> so<00:03:51.630> yeah<00:03:52.630> we're<00:03:53.019> so<00:03:53.440> close

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
maybe it'll work so yeah we're so close

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.110 
maybe it'll work so yeah we're so close
