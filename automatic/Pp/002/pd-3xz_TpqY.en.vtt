 present the menu that will allow you 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.220
 to navigate inside the site 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.110
 for example right now I'm on the 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:04.860
 homepage just click on 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.530

 which are located on the right page and 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.500

 to access the books that have been published 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.320
 by members so this part to 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.740
 three sub parts it can be 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.570
 category books validated and book published if 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:36.020
 we go in the category category the asu 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:38.420
 part category there at all 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.920
 parties all categories of the site or 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.659
 for example you can go see 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.950
 books classified in the youth part 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:49.399
 my youth category manga bedimo des 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:52.490
 novels and news for example there are 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.740
 then a subset book that validated 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.409
 will allow you to access all 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.399
 books that have been validated by the 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.429
 site moderators 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:04.420
 you have to know that there is a community 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:07.030
 of moderator monks who are going to have 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.440
 the possibility of validating or not 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.850
 certain levels so there would be a 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.480
 life a next video for you 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:17.269
 to understand what is the purpose of 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.390
 validation and how to validate his 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:19.390
 nest 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:28.810
 published book part which corresponds to little 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:31.190
 close to the category free party validated 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.930
 except that it's books that are not 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.880
 not necessarily validated so there will be 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:39.230
 validated books and non 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:41.630
 validated inside then there is a 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.790
 ranking part so the ranking of 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.290
 books by reading or contest 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.780
 writing 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:51.380
 so we're going to see in ranking 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:54.530
 books by reading it's very simple 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.830
 it's a classification of books by the 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.820
 number of readings that have been 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.920
 made by a members of the site 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.290
 so more your book is he who will 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.959
 back in the rankings 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:10.010
 Then there is a competition 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:13.359
 writing that will allow you to 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.359
 participate in writing competitions 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:20.420
 for example last contest it's you 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.420
 take a plane and crash 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.960
 this theme is created a book specially 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.640
 for this contest to participate in this 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.430
 contest has already passed but you can 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:34.989
 already voted for 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.989
 for books that have been registered 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:42.680
 then then there is the forum part and 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:45.959
 chat so the forum allows to discuss 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:48.920
 more serenely a subject for example 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:51.130
 will do but like this 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.420
 and we can go for example in the 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:57.739
 in the critical subject and the improvement 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:04:00.440
 of your books and then sharing 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:03.410
 of experiences 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:06.020
 the author if water for example has created a 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.760
 subject sharing experiences after that 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:12.280
 you can read what he wrote and 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.280
 commented by going all the way to the end 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:19.370
 his message is then and a cat 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:26.080
 it allows to discuss 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:28.270
 instant and it's pretty nice of 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.449
 discuss with people who 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.770
 share the same passion and it's 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:33.129
 really much more responsive than the 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.770
 forum 

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:38.139
 but that allows it to allow less 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.729
 ask a subject anyway but that's 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:42.669
 really very nice the evening ago 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:44.259
 a lot of people on the chat there are 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:48.699
 then the alerts that will allow 

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:50.620
 to know the said the latest subject 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:54.430
 in the forum that were created last 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:56.229

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:59.319
 you click on it you can know 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:00.729
