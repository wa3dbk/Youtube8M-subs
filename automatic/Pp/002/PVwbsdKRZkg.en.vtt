unlike the mudras or hand gestures that

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.660 
unlike the mudras or hand gestures that
we<00:03:24.420> see<00:03:24.629> in<00:03:24.659> earlier<00:03:25.109> art<00:03:25.409> these<00:03:26.129> ones<00:03:26.459> the

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
we see in earlier art these ones the

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.180 
we see in earlier art these ones the
artist<00:03:27.030> herself<00:03:27.150> has<00:03:27.569> made<00:03:27.810> up<00:03:27.989> so<00:03:28.530> one<00:03:28.799> hand

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
artist herself has made up so one hand

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.240 
artist herself has made up so one hand
is<00:03:29.459> posed<00:03:29.879> as<00:03:30.180> if<00:03:30.449> receiving<00:03:31.379> information<00:03:31.709> and

is posed as if receiving information and

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.520 
is posed as if receiving information and
the<00:03:32.669> other<00:03:32.849> hand<00:03:33.269> is<00:03:33.449> closed<00:03:33.720> as<00:03:33.959> if<00:03:33.989> giving<00:03:34.440> it

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
the other hand is closed as if giving it

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.349 
the other hand is closed as if giving it
away<00:03:34.650> so<00:03:35.370> this<00:03:35.579> is<00:03:35.699> really<00:03:35.879> about<00:03:36.180> the

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
away so this is really about the

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:38.659 
away so this is really about the
transmission<00:03:36.959> of<00:03:37.079> knowledge<00:03:37.290> about<00:03:37.829> oral
