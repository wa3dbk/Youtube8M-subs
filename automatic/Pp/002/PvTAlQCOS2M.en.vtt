00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:06.220
 michiel kramer yes that few know 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:07.990
 people on us too few people 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.400
 just a boy from rotterdam who 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.990
 ado plays for people thinking he is coming 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.150
 from volendam or where that say a lot 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.029
 people year started i'm just 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.500
 born and raised rotterdammer so yes and 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:18.939
 then you don't have that stuff 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.009
 Rotterdam club Feyenoord Sparta 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:23.680
 Excelsior and the youth I even added 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:25.750
 and when i went to nac and 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.610
 now via detour I have had again 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.170
 come back and with it the top scorer 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:33.480
 currently from the premier league 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:35.710
 handsome if your house is your 16th state one 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.300
 personally that goes well and it is 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.500
 just nice and clear the glue 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.790
 just 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.830
 I am quite happy that it is the 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.000
 personally goes so well with me completely 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.010
 glad to have three points now 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.840
 partner that was really necessary 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.370
 ramses today you win with 2 0 out of 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.840
 dordrecht you score the first goal 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.040
 your head is difficult 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.930
 I also found that I liked that we do 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.360
 whole started that might come later 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.880
 really on a very single article 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.340
 lost it for a while and but we have 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.750
 no no rest in our game we have 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.119
 We quickly lost the ball which we passed 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.280
 divers then have to run after them 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:08.380
 it just becomes awkward and 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.880
 but luckily i didn't get it whole 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.450
 a lot of great opportunities, but some possibilities 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.390
 but not very big opportunities and 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.890
 yes after those two well if it did play 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.990
 think everything you do nowadays 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.810
 touch changes to gold it stays that way 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.460
 do you think or is this incident 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.600
 he also wants matches between the goods 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.640
 you might score that 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.840
 maybe i can miss so so that 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.710
 contest will no doubt be in between 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.240
 sit alone 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.470
 I just hope one insertion is 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.640
 me personally to Indra's explained 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.170
 to make 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.000
 that is my approach and where that 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.259
 we will see that at the beginning of 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.210
 the year then you didn't have much in it 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.569
 henk frÃ¤ser said among other things 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.030
 U.S 

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:43.939
 feyenoord is looking for a striker there 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.259
 you have to look at it 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:47.909
 yes that is just nice moment i would 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.200
 so say 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.670
 but yes what i just say i can say i 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.049
 wants feyenoord but it is also one 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.090
 minute I just want a year first 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.979
 show and then this year can 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.649
 I say we go higher or what and dementia 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.299
 me then they would like a dream for them 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.450
 assured about Rotterdam and then it seems 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.450
 that makes sense
