00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 greet you friends on michael channel 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:08.580
 h and as I promised I show you my 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:12.059
 attacks by magicians only mages i can 62 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:15.150
 me 55 my 5 leveled honestly 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.210
 brewed magicians 7 magicians 6 liters in my 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.550
 the clan caste shared someone from the cycle of us 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.189
 in the immortal clan the king is queen 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.230
 300 frail one raid and here it is mine 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.449
 enemy 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:30.269
 which i will attack you see super 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.450
 root + even my bonus to 65 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.730
 gold litery 300 units of black from me 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.370
 will be here two and a half thousand almost 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.379
 black is just a sin not to take such 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.600
 adversary yes and pdf see it not really 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.160
 heavily pumped so left and right 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.920
 release of the king with the queen 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.980
 so they cleaned up a little 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.840
 this circle so my magicians don't go around 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.140
 bases and still broke through the middle 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.079
 so we are the first spell i already kill 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.420
 because there is danger from the tower 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.140
 no archers failed mage I don't want 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.629
 give up 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.700
 left really very uncomfortable with me 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.350
 magicians ran oh well I still have 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.000
 a handful of man who will run 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.479
 right now I will throw a rage 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:17.130
 even a second spell last or rather sang 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:19.500
 health i already used you see 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.229
 very quickly everything is demolished instantly 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.659
 just do not have time to respond virgins 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:29.670
 now I would surely not hurt me 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:34.020
 hill sang did not get another store 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.970
 with the elixir and die die without singing in 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.549
 my magicians are very fast big damage 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:43.619
 causes and mortars and of course the tower 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:48.299
 wizards cannons in general all steel yes 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:52.229
 so but fine though a star I took a bow I 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.659
 took it cool but very long to do 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.090
 the junction of the army is very expensive anna that is 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.700
 on magicians only 200 thousand roughly 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.590
 elixir goes away plus 4 more sang it still 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.370
 a hundred thousand or about 300 thousand 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:09.420
 elixir we spend on and of course 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:13.140
 more profitable to take something like 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:15.120
 golems or at least giants in general 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.480
 those units that will take on 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:23.880
 the main blow and the magicians will perform already 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:25.500
 the role of cleaning up buildings and of course you 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.810
 you understand they do not cause damage 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.060
 they have little health 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.770
 so where is my second opponent one in 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.950
 only one wife army at the Planck 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:37.950
 Me this magicians 6 leveled 55 my magicians 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.440
 family one-to-one in the same Spilka 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.660
 I don't see me as a buyer 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.270
 I don't take it 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.400
 jump sang because magicians are very fast 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.860
 destroy any fence especially in such 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:55.350
 the number of magicians they are with any fence 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:03:00.720
 cope and so where are we 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:03.530
 where is my opponent too little for everyone 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.530
 too 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.890
 there is nothing at all black 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.220
 I and a half to get there will be 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.220
 attack 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:26.570
 very little of everything and pdf and uninteresting 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:28.370
 bases perfectly or at least give me with 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.410
 a large lot of someone maximum 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.140
 pumped over 8 m x would be 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.150
 cool to carry it here now he's my 9 x 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.640
 interesting way so I wanted to base 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.860
 hands on but for gold 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:43.010
 Elixir is nothing but there is little black 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:46.240
 2000 black elixir and so same 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:49.480
 strategy at the top left we throw the king 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:53.810
 let us interrupt the circle well and below 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:56.720
 right we also throw we queens q well 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.530
 the rest of the magicians drove to clear 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.530
 territory 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.250
 so there is a lot of magicians left to do 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.790
 somehow compensate for all perfect 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:10.190
 that pony in the middle all went so far 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.170
 the king itself distracts df magicians very 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.360
 quickly destroyed 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:16.280
 I already sang a tower with magicians 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.709
 used now for work I have one more 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.170
 why did I throw it there at the mercy well 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:24.110
 why did they run off with cheese right now 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:26.900
 I would throw out a speech now kimovich and in 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:30.020
 the middle girl I would have a movie another sang 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:34.630
 Now health and dick would have demolished this 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:37.610
 base of plant bombs all my magicians died 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:41.360
 okay black I managed to take one star 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:44.570
 managed a bonus goal got all those satisfied 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:47.030
 magic of course is very, very cunning 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:49.040
 guys so i think there will be more video 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:52.340
 probably with magicians because I put them on 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:54.490
 many, if interested, we will lay out everything to everyone 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.490
 until
