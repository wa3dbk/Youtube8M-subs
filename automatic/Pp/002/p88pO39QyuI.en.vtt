00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.989
 year we tackled the theme of the circus as 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.090
 I had talked to someone somewhere 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.390
 reportage the theme of the circus is very 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.610
 broad and is a very subject that calls 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.339
 much to the family is an excellent subject 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:01.500
 actually a lot of colorful and it does not help 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:04.710
 that is to present a show of how 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:08.240
 I said a lot that allows us a great 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.800
 performance fan staged 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.000
 we talk about the importance they have 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.250
 the floats that are being made 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.950
 here obviously it's not all yet 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.960
 mounted but that is going to be what most 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.479
 work will also lead him to finish 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.390
 to assemble each of the figures that 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.789
 are wanting to express with art yes 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.030
 yes yes yes they are actually floats 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:32.070
 towering are gigantic sculptures and 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.350
 that are worked in different parts in 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.210
 reality or you have to work with 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.729
 a lot of crane and assembly takes us one day 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.100
 completely practically they are so 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.470
 imposing so awesome that good or a 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.430
 muds at about 12 meters 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.680
 I want to add that good to this year 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.240
 adding is speaking of the circus we are going to 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.880
 also address the circus criollo also 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.009
 that is the circus in the different stages 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.770
 the circus from what is the part of the 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:03.659
 Argentine circus with what the story 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:05.640

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.600
 let's work with the european circus 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.850
 after 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.330
 the different stages of the circus that was 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.280
 evolving we see many workers 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.280
 working collaborating with what is the 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:24.160
 work that you have designed trying to 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.320
 translate what I say this happens day after day 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.260
 and it intensifies when it goes 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.570
 approaching the date yes yes that is a 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.130
 work that is from the part of 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.840
 carpentry in the blacksmith part of 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.410
 the part of sculpture the part of 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.580
 cloth work the part is a different 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.260
 processes that are being carried out to 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.080
 build such a monster in reality 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.670
 it is in the part of illumina also 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.140
 that after good what the end is the 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.670
 part of lighting that is what 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.320
 also embellishes the theme of the theme of 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.810
 good carriage I forgot about the painter 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.400
 we have a painter who comes to help 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.930
 with us that is from gualeguaychÃº that 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.810
 he is an excellent person too and good 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.360
 because nothing would be a sculpture if not 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.970
 has a good paint finish yet 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.550
 these floats will not be exposed 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.710
 December 8 just what 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.660
 will do is present part of the 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.760
 the choreography dances but this does not 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.040
 is going to read until January no no no no no 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.020
 this is actually a surprise in 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.460
 reality is something that is presented to 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.960
 end is something that people expect with 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.930
 a lot of anxiety are really 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.790
 so great monuments that what good 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.410
 That saved until the end and already 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.670
 start talking about the carnival of what 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.260
 It is going to see you in January 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.270
 they also work throughout the year 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.530
 for us we work all the time 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.970
 the year we are working that is the 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.390
 project starts in March more or less 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.910
 with all that is the part of sketches 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.680
 and then you start to develop the 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.170
 theme of the sketch with the work team 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.209
 that is to say, this carnival does not 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.940
 it's only a float with a pirogue 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.860
 everything wears the costume party 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.750
 that is impressive impressive the 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.400
 clothes that are making stuffed animals 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.920
