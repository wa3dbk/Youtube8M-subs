00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 how to make oriental furniture with 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.560
 bamboo and lacquers the far east is 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.120
 increasingly closer and their styles objects 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.010
 and furniture have made their way in the 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.300
 Western world 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.820
 anyone can bring an air 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.680
 Asian table by a movable one 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.380
 armchair or a shelf using the 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.300
 bamboo as elementary material ones 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.189
 Lacquered boards for the realization of 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.529
 flat surfaces will contribute to even 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.150
 more to this oriental setting that is 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.970
 you can get for a price nothing 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.309
 exaggerated for all those who are 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.710
 tired of the wood this material may 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.440
 be a great solution to be manufactured 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.420
 some furniture made from bamboo 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.460
 precisely bamboo is characterized by 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.350
 its surface irregularity and its knots 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.510
 spaced which provides you 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.480
 character and its interesting effect of 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.070
 exoticism on the other hand 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.340
 construction is extraordinarily 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.199
 simple the main job consists 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.989
 in cutting the bamboo canes to size 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.609
 exact required for each item 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.980
 the bamboo that is offered in different 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:05.100
 thicknesses should be purchased in stores 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.750
 Specialized products straw 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.360
 reeds and similar 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.190
 directly in according to what cases in 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.890
 stores dedicated to products for the 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.540
 garden and orchard since bamboo 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.490
 is a material that does not tolerate well 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.770
 nails and screws is not easy to in 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.510
 casting strips should be used 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.220
 leather about three millimeters wide 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.070
 and not too thick to perform the 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.780
 joints of the elements this material 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.850
 will be acquired in establishments 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.910
 leather goods and leather 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.170
 the DIY and in department stores 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:36.540
 if these strips are not already 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.369
 elaborated oneself can get them 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.920
 cutting with a cutter a piece of 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:44.369
 leather especially one whose condition 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:47.160
 be softer for cuts to make 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.110
 of a metal rule the way to do 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.910
 the unions between two or more elements of 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.119
 Bamboo is well illustrated in the photos 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.710
 following where you see the detail for 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.330
 achieve a perfect hole you have to 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.970
 hold the piece of bamboo before 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.910
 act with the drill the drill 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.740
 effects in two phases first a 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.950
 small diameter hole and then the 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.630
 second drilling of definitive size 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.640
 also the edge of the hole is hazelnut 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.560
 lightly with a strawberry 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.690
 it is very important that the element that 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.480
 acts of crossbars stay exactly 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.130
 in a hole of its same diameter 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.930
 so much can very well that because of the 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.940
 irregularity in thickness along the 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.000
 cane should be made holes 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.620
 different caliber for both ends 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.270
 the leather strips are soaked during 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.520
 one hour in warm water so that when 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.250
 dry they shrink and tighten the 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.140
 elements that join in the photos that are 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.730
 accompany they look perfectly like 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.340
 arrange them knotted so that they 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.989
 match the crossbars in 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.550
 regarding the construction of the table 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.440
 to keep in mind to unite all 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.050
 elements up to the fourth crossbar 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.910
 top place then the boards 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.480
 lacquered from the bottom and fix and 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.650
 knot the corresponding crossbars 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.140
 finally the two boards are provided 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.959
 from above securing those from below by 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.670
 medium pulls bamboo stalk 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.489
 It is placed between two slats and 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.410
 holds firmly with a prison 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.600
 carefully drill the tube with a 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.420
 10 millimeter drill bit making it 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.400
 Slowly advance a rasp milling cutter 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.740
 abellÃ¡n to the edges to facilitate the 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.870
 entrance of the cane that crosses it 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:21.450
 to avoid hard ripping on the stem of 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.040
 bamboo give very little slack before the 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.830
 bound with a leather strip must 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.870
 Soak the strips with warm water 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.510
 Proportionate elasticity becomes 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.070
 in a seized when the 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.320
 basic frame for the table 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.940
 desk because of the ligatures with 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.100
 Leather is very stable to the structure 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.980
 take care of the separation of the legs and 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.840
 they unite the two bodies together 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.670
 boards are presented to check the 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.700
 lace before proceeding to the final 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.740
 tied of the elements to receive each 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.440

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.360
 saw the edges of the drills of 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.930
 the reeds and edges should be sanded 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.100

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.110
 introduce the bamboo then once 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.300
 sewn some notches with hems
