00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.950
 Hello friends 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.480
 the easter party is approaching and how 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.059
 it is better to prepare a beautiful one 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:20.710
 torta pasqualina ok follow this one 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:24.579
 search or was the base 300 g of 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:27.550
 flour half then 150 of butter and 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:29.980
 liquid to paola what you need for 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:33.370
 form a ball then lies 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:36.370
 it takes 800 grams of the filling 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.830
 spinach or good taste I've already 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.280
 boiled in salted water and well squeezed 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.420
 to remove the process three eggs 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:48.970
 I do it a bit special because 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:52.840
 inside I put 6 quail covers then 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:55.450
 it takes 250 g of fresh ricotta 100 g 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.570
 of grated walnut cheese 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.570
 nutmeg 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.940
 first we put our own 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.570
 flour on pastry board such as note butter 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:10.050
 g 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:10.050
 so price a base on loose 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:19.150
 we start to pass are ingredients 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:21.790
 very quickly and then we join a 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:25.350
 little milk to form our ball 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.350
 by logic 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.570
 here you see we have formed ours 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:34.060
 veiled ball have put just little is 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:37.330
 half of what was not even type 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.010
 4 4 tablespoons but also to 5 tablespoons ok 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.750
 now the pasta to what you have learned see 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:46.260
 this consistency we do not work from 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:49.210
 we put it in the fridge too you see 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:52.810
 in the refrigerator to rest for half an hour 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.990
 see you in the film 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.990
 a bit 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.540
 meanwhile our dough 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:04.240
 rest in the fridge we prepare 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:12.210
 we say our ricotta seems to me 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:12.210
 fresh ricotta 250 as I told you no 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:28.660
 add our two eggs 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:31.560
 the third place to turn off the bas then a 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.560
 bit of nutmeg 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:49.080
 salt does not emit because my spinach 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:52.980
 they are already excellent ingredients now not 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:55.230
 we are adding projects to the police station 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:03:01.440
 of a spinach game you can use 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:03.690
 even the referees then is a door that yes 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.640
 It is generally between Easter treats 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.870
 however it will be if to do low in 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.870
 situation because the mind 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.420
 Yup 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:23.080
 and very close and then now we have to 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.090
 push the dough to face ours 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.040
 basis 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:31.450
 we sell our pasta and remove one 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:34.270
 bit and then we will always put to which 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:40.180
 then I could put some flour on the 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:44.440
 pastry board to roll out apples and let's go 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:46.420
 asti to begin to take the 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:50.320
 Our pasta, you see how well it is spent 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:56.320
 it's a couple of millimeters we put it that way 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:59.580
 and export comes now let's go to 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.580
 vote for charity 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:08.590
 right 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:22.170
 once leveled well we now have to 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:27.000
 him some holes to put our 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:29.820
 quail eggs made our holes 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.420
 as you say I helped myself with a 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:35.490
 spoon I do side so when 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:38.390
 we cut the slice you will see just everything 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:42.320
 the egg now gently 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:42.320
 let's go to bed 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:55.740
 at this point you see how solo and 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:59.490
 eggs then the other piece I said 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:05.870
 that I have put you down here and with 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:09.260
 I sell this job to him 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.260
 all the data 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:19.470
 just the last one left 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:25.520
 now we're going to brush for the 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:30.020
 ours will not fix a nice say all 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:30.020
 that we make our pasta a little bit 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:46.010
 now the world 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:46.010
 50 gr of 55 thousand 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:56.110
 we come later here is the pasqualina cake 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:58.060
 with quail eggs and very good fruit 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:00.210
 now they cut me a party to do 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.210
 to live 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.849
