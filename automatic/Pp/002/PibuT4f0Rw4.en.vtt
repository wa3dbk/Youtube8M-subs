00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:09.150
 hi youtube friends are killer 666 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.460
 and today I am here again on armor ed 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.960
 keane and as promised I will talk to you a little 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.059
 of the c 130 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.830
 in particular how it works as you do 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.529
 use and above all I will give you some 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.449
 advice on how to break it down before 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.670
 we all have to see how it works 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.369
 then the c130 as many of you 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.300
 they will know it is driven by a bot and not by 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.830
 a person 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.840
 this is both good and bad 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.719
 because a bang is better than a person 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.570
 unknown that so much can be good and 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.750
 so it is not but it is also true that the 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.640
 c130 follows a linear path without ever 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.719
 change trajectory and it is a lot 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.760
 predictable even if in my opinion the c130 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.219
 it's perfect enough to know it 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.680
 managing many call it over power 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.420
 while others under power 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.449
 it all depends if we know how to manage it e 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.180
 that is the fact then the difficulty not 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.280
 is to say let's kill people there 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.199
 difficulty while remaining the most 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.479
 long possible in life because it is a lot 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.790
 vulnerable and above all predictable 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.930
 since as we have already said it is 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.390
 driven by a bot 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.970
 as many have told me in the comments 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.090
 armor and who perhaps is fantastic just for 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.490
 pc but on console and a bit boring me 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.590
 this I had already imagined because on 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.590
 console as we know the maximum of 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.780
 players is 24 but you want to give a 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.060
 i recommend try rush which is a 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.979
 much more fun mode there 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.740
 many players are needed to do so many 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.909
 kill also for fun 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.530
 the only thing that leaves me a little 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.680
 puzzled is that the acid trend 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.210
 available only for attackers and is a 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.869
 big advantage indeed all the 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.610
 games I did in rush and from 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.860
 I practically attacked and I always won e 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.200
 always made absurd scores like 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.049
 we can see these eleven 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.329
 this clip, however, you don't think that 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.920
 this is the most monstrous grippe I have 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.600
 unfortunately done guys I did one 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.220
 clip with 44 kg 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.509
 and zero day how can we see it 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.970
 screen unfortunately I was not 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:10.350
 recording the game is over 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:12.120
 70 73 so really a nice game 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:16.020
 obviously these results do not 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.360
 you get if you defend because precisely the 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:23.700
 c130 is something absurd 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:26.160
 especially the rush that no one there 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.150
 find teammates who 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.980
 they are stupid they don't use league ha 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:35.100
 practically it was c130 flutters 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.920
 quietly and never threw it and never 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.810
 in fact, when he defends use 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.450
 I always enjoy the jet a lot e 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:46.500
 I do forget some nice little 10 kg 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:50.519
 lunde a2 dives more because me 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:53.400
 enjoy killing the ac 130 and the members 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:55.230
 jet depends if that is good is a bit 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.450
 more difficult but usually not 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.890
 very good uses the jet that is 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.650
 difficult to find a person enough 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.150
 expert as in the subjects 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.100
 ok now i want to give you some 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.590
 advice on how to prolong yours 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.079
 stay on the c 130 first of all 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.239
 you have to know that the c130 with two 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:14.760
 stations the one you are seeing in 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:17.340
 video in my opinion is the most lethal to do 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.320
 king the second in my opinion who the 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.269
 uses should defend more 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:24.299
 trend emphasis using the 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:26.430
 yard site supplied then a 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:28.859
 other advice I can give you is 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.780
 to get the flare fired first 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:32.850
 your partner if you don't know him 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:36.870
 obviously because if you know him livid 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:38.700
 via ts skype or if you communicate on 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.950
 I don't know how playstation works 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.019
 obviously communicate the companies you hear 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.630
 shot or I shoot because you maybe 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:48.600
 gel and fired so you can 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.640
 quietly shoot these two flares 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.310
 once one is once gives another 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.890
 while if it happens almost always to me too 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.480
 that I don't know the person or why the 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.370
 my friend failed to get on 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.600
 c chen zhen or why I was playing from 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.120
 only 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:06.329
 the thing I noticed is that people 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.940
 will always shoot flare immediately then you 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:11.160
 let your ally shoot first and 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.740
 then you will shoot 1 like that 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.500
 hard net a little more 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:18.110
 the c130 another advice I give you is 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.180
 that of killing the people who are still there 

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:22.280
 people for me why me 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.680
 when they see two people or three people 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.630
 who are running 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:29.930
 let's say I'm tempted to kill them 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.730
 because I make myself 3 kg easy however easy 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.790
 if I see a person stop I shoot a 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:36.920
 that and not to the other three for which 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.720
 reason why that person stops is 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.790
 the one that is hooking me with Libya 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.260
 because you have to know that there is if 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.390
 we use league is not that there 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:48.140
 let's run about jumping like heidi 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:50.540
 and then we stop and engage 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:53.780
 we wait for the 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.430
 our goal is practically me what 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.410
 I always shoot these people 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.390
 most of these people stop 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:03.290
 they are always in their base just 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:05.650
 at the expo one change assault kit 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:08.030
 they pass to gender is practically 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.190
 using them glass and they obviously hide 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.350
 so you guys have to be a lot 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.450
 watch out for these people because it's true 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:16.400
 there are people who eat the boxes ate 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:19.670
 up to a certain point because used 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:22.370
 the antiaircraft and break down quietly 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:25.160
 while the people with league are many 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:27.110
 Sometimes it happened to me that I was seven 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.870
 gla missiles came to me is 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:33.230
 I could practically do nothing 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:36.290
 because I had already fired before 

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:38.660
 practically the flare and nothing then i 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:40.580
 guys pay close attention to 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:43.190
 people using league the why 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:45.050
 they are the deadliest ones ok after having you 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:46.250
 given some advice on how to use the 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.960
 c130 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:50.750
 now I want to give you some advice on 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.550
 how to break down the c130 as we know 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:55.250
 being very large it won't be much 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:57.530
 difficult not to hit it with the jet but 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:00.200
 the fundamental advice I want you 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:02.510
 giving is to attack the c130 from 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:04.720
 low up we look at these 

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:04.720
 images 

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:16.259
 why stick it from the bottom up 

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:18.509
 because as we will remember the c130 with two 

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:19.469
 aerial doors supplied and we would be the 

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:21.599
 easy targets 

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:22.529
 so we must never exceed it by 

00:06:21.599 --> 00:06:24.329
 quote 

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:25.979
 then sits like me dissatisfied with 

00:06:24.329 --> 00:06:28.789
 you can always fly with the jet 

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:28.789
 try this
