00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
this is an LED bulb and trim it's going

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.880 
this is an LED bulb and trim it's going
to<00:00:04.170> replace<00:00:04.620> the<00:00:05.009> trim<00:00:05.279> and<00:00:05.520> bulb<00:00:05.759> and<00:00:06.089> the

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:06.890 
to replace the trim and bulb and the

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.259 
to replace the trim and bulb and the
under<00:00:07.890> the<00:00:07.919> porch<00:00:08.250> that<00:00:08.460> I<00:00:08.490> already<00:00:08.730> have<00:00:08.940> here

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
under the porch that I already have here

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.990 
under the porch that I already have here
I<00:00:09.450> don't<00:00:10.050> really<00:00:10.230> like<00:00:10.500> complex<00:00:11.250> compact

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
I don't really like complex compact

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.910 
I don't really like complex compact
fluorescents<00:00:12.690> so<00:00:13.290> I'm<00:00:13.349> going<00:00:13.500> to<00:00:13.559> put<00:00:13.679> in<00:00:13.769> this

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
fluorescents so I'm going to put in this

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.040 
fluorescents so I'm going to put in this
one<00:00:14.070> and<00:00:14.219> said<00:00:14.370> this<00:00:14.519> is<00:00:14.730> a<00:00:14.759> 65<00:00:15.389> watt<00:00:15.420> it<00:00:18.020> is<00:00:19.020> a

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
one and said this is a 65 watt it is a

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.080 
one and said this is a 65 watt it is a
warm<00:00:19.439> white<00:00:19.740> and<00:00:20.010> you'll<00:00:20.490> want<00:00:20.850> to<00:00:20.939> pay

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
warm white and you'll want to pay

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.980 
warm white and you'll want to pay
attention<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:23.090> these<00:00:24.090> little<00:00:24.150> numbers<00:00:24.689> here

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
attention to these little numbers here

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.109 
attention to these little numbers here
you<00:00:25.080> can<00:00:25.230> see<00:00:25.410> that<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.769> color<00:00:26.490> temperature

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
you can see that the color temperature

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.720 
you can see that the color temperature
is<00:00:27.150> represented<00:00:28.050> in<00:00:28.880> K<00:00:29.880> here<00:00:30.420> so<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:31.730> generally

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
is represented in K here so I generally

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.780 
is represented in K here so I generally
prefer<00:00:32.910> something<00:00:33.420> around<00:00:33.780> here<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.489> I<00:00:35.489> hate

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
prefer something around here and I hate

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.200 
prefer something around here and I hate
the<00:00:36.059> kind<00:00:36.600> of<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.840> light<00:00:37.050> that<00:00:37.380> these<00:00:38.210> color

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
the kind of the light that these color

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.920 
the kind of the light that these color
bulbs<00:00:39.600> give<00:00:39.809> off<00:00:40.020> this<00:00:40.410> kind<00:00:40.890> of<00:00:40.980> daylight<00:00:41.930> so

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
bulbs give off this kind of daylight so

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.720 
bulbs give off this kind of daylight so
when<00:00:43.530> you<00:00:43.649> buy<00:00:43.800> bulbs<00:00:44.219> you'll<00:00:44.399> want<00:00:44.610> to

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
when you buy bulbs you'll want to

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.660 
when you buy bulbs you'll want to
remember<00:00:45.230> the<00:00:46.230> ones<00:00:46.410> you<00:00:46.559> like<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:46.950> always

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
remember the ones you like and always

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.709 
remember the ones you like and always
match<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.680> color<00:00:49.680> temperature<00:00:50.449> so<00:00:51.449> here's

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
match the color temperature so here's

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.799 
match the color temperature so here's
the<00:00:51.870> new<00:00:51.989> Truman<00:00:52.440> bulb<00:00:52.730> you<00:00:53.730> can<00:00:53.910> see<00:00:54.149> it's<00:00:54.570> got

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
the new Truman bulb you can see it's got

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.889 
the new Truman bulb you can see it's got
a<00:00:54.840> little<00:00:55.260> plug<00:00:56.129> there<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:57.629> gives<00:00:57.780> you

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
a little plug there and it gives you

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.560 
a little plug there and it gives you
this<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.260> screw<00:00:58.500> in<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.710> socket<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.539> what<00:01:00.539> I

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
this to screw in the socket and what I

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.049 
this to screw in the socket and what I
like<00:01:00.809> about<00:01:00.989> this<00:01:01.320> is<00:01:01.649> especially<00:01:02.579> for<00:01:02.760> under

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
like about this is especially for under

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.660 
like about this is especially for under
the<00:01:03.180> porch<00:01:03.449> there's<00:01:03.780> nowhere<00:01:04.019> for<00:01:04.430> bugs<00:01:05.430> and

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
the porch there's nowhere for bugs and

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.370 
the porch there's nowhere for bugs and
spiders<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:06.299> go<00:01:06.420> in<00:01:06.540> there<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:06.780> die<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.170> hide

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
spiders to go in there and die and hide

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.260 
spiders to go in there and die and hide
and<00:01:07.590> make<00:01:07.680> quickly<00:01:08.310> looking<00:01:08.580> cobwebs<00:01:09.090> and
