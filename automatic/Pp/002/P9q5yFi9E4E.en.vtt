00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.680
 Hello together, viewers love 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.110
 we come with him 

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.569
 Förste Epson or Förster 2 

00:00:09.569 --> 00:00:13.369
 we'll just show my follow-up minutes as we do 

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:15.209
 for a photo-cd action 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:19.369
 approached in Kippel in the portrait area clarified for this would be calm as a model 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:20.739
 wanted many thanks again 

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:24.140
 we stand the gate through the whole series with us 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.590
 we are here ready camera is there 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.619
 Of course, 500e knows with the kit lens 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:31.289
 and we want to do that now 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.730
 Step by step they show how to take pictures how we build up the whole picture 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.070
 and there we would already be the first film theme that would be the camera 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.570
 Mode find the camera turned on INTERSCHALT so look forward then put 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.770
 you have to decide forcibly if he is now 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.480
 or Brooks Modest now stops and that is now the first question to clarify 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.040
 gives 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.320
 The rescuers at this point say that they are not photographs in every film 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.690
 or take pictures though 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.070
 we are the latest at this whole 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.600
 systematically through 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.450
 Kammerer mode 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:03.449
 actually 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.340
 for this work only second meaningful modes and that would be AG aperture preselection 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.860
 The manual mode and the difference between the two agree on something 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.910
 on the hand in the aperture code that would be here s.der camera the mode 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:17.820
 Count v 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.740
 because you bring a screen before the creative factor that's me 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.180
 Define if I and Hare Blurs background if I want to 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.980
 in a lot of sharpness in the picture 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.200
 and I wanted to get lost 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.980
 and the camera then tries the correct shutter bar 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.580
 these are set to achieve and not in manual mode 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:37.500
 how so 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.150
 Exposure Steitz 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.310
 The aperture in front of each and the camera makes nothing more than Schaaf 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.000
 set and trigger 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.770
 and percent of the difference had addressed the goods for this one 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:49.580
 very logical 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.750
 By having the mode one has continuity one always has the same photos when the 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.750
 Conditions around it are the same 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.970
 It can not be a reason, so to speak, it is a real percent work 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.560
 that means every picture that comes out of the chamber 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.320
 gave 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.320
 the same property and you know what you get when you pull back 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.489
 Continuity, of course, can also be at the beginning of St for when 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.569
 the environment when the brightness changes 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:15.349
 for example, in itself 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:18.239
 he wanted to push back in front of the sun then of course the brightness stand 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.209
 not the camera does not fit 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.059
 and that bwin and the illuminated 

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:25.569
 because then, for example, the aperture code would be the better solution 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:26.470
 that would become 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.439
 each adapt 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:31.650
 I would like to show you the light situation and that for a short time 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.359
 make some photos in this one in this movie here i just got it 

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:36.059
 times 

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:39.459
 put the band off by itself and just make my name real Closer 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.200
 Portrait the correction 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.740
 the comrade exposure compensation I have completely disabled it again so 0 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.980
 she makes simple correctly exposed picture 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.980
 yes I try to reach the chamber 

00:02:51.779 --> 00:02:56.589
 and we clearly see the camera has a single one here 

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:59.850
 Fiftieth aperture 5 6 worked at ISO 100 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.110
 and that was shopping for the camera endorses the picture if I am now 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.679
 really go back times 

00:03:04.679 --> 00:03:06.169
 and I do full-body 

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:08.879
 Picture of Raul 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:12.519
 we are very clear hor the camera attitude would become one 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:14.049
 512 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:16.899
 same aperture of 5 6 at ISO 100 why 

00:03:16.899 --> 00:03:18.510
 Raul was wearing a white shirt 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.290
 that knows dispute the hl and the camera just did not see that I know 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.989
 would like to photograph that Raul has white on and has accordingly the 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:27.799
 Exposure went down a bit worldwide 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:31.219
 This reflects light from the white shirt, the camera was just too much to see 

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:33.790
 So I'm only half a meter backwards so far had pulled 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.219
 you took the picture and the shot is completely different 

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:40.579
 why that is so? "We clarify that in the second film, but it remains to be said 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:42.179
 for this first part 

00:03:42.179 --> 00:03:43.210
 but Odos 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.070
 yes the aperture code for 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.270
 will change the association situation and keep everyone political drama was still to come 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.800
 Things to do and the manual mode when you're safe in the 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.920
 Settings has found the setting and really continuity 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.240
 continuity 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.599
 yes would like to take pictures with continuity 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:00.909
 that will be first 

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:01.670
 until the next movie
