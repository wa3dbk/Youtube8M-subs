00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.469 

my<00:00:45.300> fork<00:00:45.719> doesn't<00:00:46.379> change<00:00:46.670> so<00:00:47.670> it's<00:00:48.030> not<00:00:48.239> like

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:48.479 
my fork doesn't change so it's not like

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:54.220 
my fork doesn't change so it's not like
it's<00:00:48.659> any<00:00:48.809> easier<00:00:49.429> I<00:00:50.429> just<00:00:51.239> have<00:00:51.479> to<00:00:51.719> think<00:00:51.989> of

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
it's any easier I just have to think of

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.560 

a<00:00:54.440> different<00:00:55.160> way<00:00:55.489> to<00:00:55.850> approach<00:00:56.000> the

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
a different way to approach the

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.660 
a different way to approach the
character<00:00:57.140> of<00:00:57.380> its<00:00:57.500> totally<00:00:58.309> different

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
character of its totally different

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.090 
character of its totally different
perspective<00:00:59.380> and<00:01:00.380> it<00:01:00.530> deals<00:01:00.770> with<00:01:01.750> a

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
perspective and it deals with a

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.080 
perspective and it deals with a
character<00:01:04.100> who<00:01:04.430> really<00:01:04.879> was<00:01:05.059> so<00:01:05.239> powerful<00:01:07.090> the

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
character who really was so powerful the

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.540 
character who really was so powerful the
last<00:01:08.630> latter<00:01:09.260> half<00:01:09.619> of<00:01:09.800> the<00:01:09.950> past<00:01:10.250> couple
