Hi, my name's Dan Jenkins from Science and Plants for Schools.

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.290
I'm going to talk about
plant defences and

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.469
adaptations today and we've got a really
easy and interesting practical for your 
students to do

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.679
using the stinging nettle.
A stinging nettle

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.390
has got a fantastic adaptation. If you think
about how many times you have been stung

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.970
by them

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.470
it's just a brilliant one to use with your students. 
And we're going to get your students

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.660
look at the mechanism by which stings
work

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.310
For us we know that on the
underside of the leaves are

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:29.060
modified cells

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.230
which have needle-like projections which
contain formic acid

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.850
the very same acid that ant bites
cause irritation with

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.600
on your skin. 
It's a very simple investigation for them to look at.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.000
All they need to do is to grab a stinging
nettle leaf. And you should be able to find

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.200
a stinging nettle some where in the school grounds.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.420
They're everywhere.
You take a slice

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.840
of your stinging nettle leaf

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:57.090
on your slide
I'm wearing gloves to do this for obvious reasons.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.199
and you put the lowermost

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:05.570
surface of the leaf facing you on the slide.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.799
Take a piece of universal indicator 
paper

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:13.740
And you're going to dip that into tap water

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.380
just to moisten it, and then you lay it over

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.070
your stinging nettle and using a
piece of acetate

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.500
- OHP material - just cut to the size of your slide

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.549
you press that over the slide

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.700
pressing down on the universal indicator paper.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.150
As you do that you'll be breaking those fragile stings.
and if you have a look at

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.990
the universial indicator paper and hold it up to the light

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.840
you'll see there are colour changes.
Little blotches of colour where the stings have burst.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.890
and because it's acid we've got little yellow blotches there.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.049
You can get your students to analyze whether the

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.560
stings are more prevalent on that higher leaves or on the lower leaves

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.530
We've got loads of other
investigations to do with plant adaptations

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:00.530
available on our website

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.740
If you go to www.saps.org.uk

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.290
We've got student sheets for this practical

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.129
We've got teacher notes on this and we've got technician sheets.

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.020
Go have a look, and see what you find.
