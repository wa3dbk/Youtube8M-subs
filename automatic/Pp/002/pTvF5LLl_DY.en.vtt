and<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.549> combined<00:01:21.330> number<00:01:21.840> is<00:01:21.990> multiplied

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
and that combined number is multiplied

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
prize pool well let's say for example

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.819 
prize pool well let's say for example
that<00:01:56.430> is<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.729> hundred<00:01:57.180> gold<00:01:57.390> if<00:01:57.689> one<00:01:58.530> of<00:01:58.680> you

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
that is a hundred gold if one of you

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.770 
that is a hundred gold if one of you
manages<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.399> land<00:01:59.520> on<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.820> sweet<00:02:00.119> spot<00:02:00.450> on<00:02:00.630> the

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
perfect number dies the person wings

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.330 
perfect number dies the person wings
double<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.020> price<00:02:04.229> ball<00:02:04.560> so<00:02:05.070> that<00:02:05.189> would<00:02:05.310> be

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
double the price ball so that would be

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.330 
double the price ball so that would be
200<00:02:05.939> gold<00:02:06.180> if<00:02:06.810> you<00:02:07.110> exceed<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:08.009> maximum

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.880 
pool which in this case was 100 gold
next<00:02:21.610> up<00:02:21.760> is<00:02:21.970> the<00:02:22.210> Deirdre<00:02:22.750> challenge<00:02:23.350> which

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
next up is the Deirdre challenge which

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.310 
next up is the Deirdre challenge which
you<00:02:24.040> sort<00:02:24.340> of<00:02:24.430> like<00:02:24.700> snakes<00:02:25.120> and<00:02:25.390> ladders<00:02:25.570> each

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
you sort of like snakes and ladders each

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.290 
you sort of like snakes and ladders each
player<00:02:26.770> will<00:02:26.950> automatically<00:02:27.670> roll<00:02:27.880> their<00:02:28.090> two

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
player will automatically roll their two

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.600 
player will automatically roll their two
dice<00:02:28.600> and<00:02:28.960> move<00:02:29.260> their<00:02:29.500> piece<00:02:29.830> across<00:02:30.310> the

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
dice and move their piece across the

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.910 
dice and move their piece across the
board<00:02:30.880> which<00:02:31.360> is<00:02:31.540> dependent<00:02:32.080> on<00:02:32.170> number<00:02:32.620> old

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
board which is dependent on number old

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.060 
board which is dependent on number old
so<00:02:33.550> if<00:02:33.730> you<00:02:33.910> roll<00:02:34.270> to<00:02:34.630> force<00:02:35.020> you<00:02:35.410> will<00:02:35.530> move<00:02:35.740> up

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
so if you roll to force you will move up

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.090 
so if you roll to force you will move up
a<00:02:36.370> places<00:02:37.150> if<00:02:37.360> either<00:02:38.110> of<00:02:38.410> you<00:02:38.620> land<00:02:38.860> on<00:02:38.980> the

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
a places if either of you land on the

rolls the two dies say you roll 10 from

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.220 
rolls the two dies say you roll 10 from
here<00:03:06.580> you<00:03:06.820> must<00:03:07.030> decide<00:03:07.390> if<00:03:07.540> your<00:03:07.690> opponent's

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
here you must decide if your opponent's

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.500 
here you must decide if your opponent's
role<00:03:08.500> will<00:03:09.070> be<00:03:09.100> either<00:03:09.340> lower<00:03:09.730> higher<00:03:10.210> or

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
role will be either lower higher or

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.320 
role will be either lower higher or
equal<00:03:10.960> to<00:03:11.140> your<00:03:11.410> rule<00:03:11.650> if<00:03:11.950> you<00:03:12.610> take<00:03:12.850> the<00:03:13.030> risk

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
equal to your rule if you take the risk

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.020 
equal to your rule if you take the risk
and<00:03:13.570> decide<00:03:14.020> to<00:03:14.200> bound<00:03:14.380> equal<00:03:14.980> then<00:03:15.490> your<00:03:15.730> bet

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
and decide to bound equal then your bet

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.380 
and decide to bound equal then your bet
is<00:03:16.210> tripled<00:03:16.750> so<00:03:17.500> if<00:03:17.680> you<00:03:17.860> sticked<00:03:18.400> 10<00:03:18.790> gold<00:03:19.120> on

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
is tripled so if you sticked 10 gold on

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.140 
is tripled so if you sticked 10 gold on
this<00:03:19.630> round<00:03:19.930> and<00:03:20.230> you<00:03:20.740> guessed<00:03:21.010> equal<00:03:21.550> your

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
this round and you guessed equal your

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.930 
this round and you guessed equal your
stick<00:03:22.510> is<00:03:22.720> now<00:03:22.990> 30<00:03:23.380> goals<00:03:23.770> for<00:03:24.160> this<00:03:24.280> round<00:03:24.580> and

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
stick is now 30 goals for this round and

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.449 
stick is now 30 goals for this round and
if<00:03:25.330> you<00:03:25.510> lose<00:03:25.840> your<00:03:26.470> opponent<00:03:26.950> gets<00:03:27.070> it<00:03:27.310> all

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
if you lose your opponent gets it all

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.880 
if you lose your opponent gets it all
from<00:03:28.209> my<00:03:28.420> testing<00:03:28.720> I<00:03:29.140> believe<00:03:29.440> the<00:03:29.590> winner<00:03:29.800> of

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
from my testing I believe the winner of

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.470 
from my testing I believe the winner of
a<00:03:30.040> round<00:03:30.280> gets<00:03:30.670> what<00:03:30.850> the<00:03:30.970> other<00:03:31.150> player<00:03:31.390> has

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
a round gets what the other player has

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.720 
a round gets what the other player has
staked<00:03:31.990> for<00:03:32.380> that<00:03:32.530> round<00:03:32.770> so<00:03:33.459> if<00:03:33.610> your

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
staked for that round so if your

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.030 
staked for that round so if your
opponent's<00:03:34.270> take<00:03:34.420> five<00:03:34.720> gold<00:03:35.050> you<00:03:35.650> would<00:03:35.830> win

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
opponent's take five gold you would win

a<00:04:31.360> simple<00:04:31.690> formula<00:04:32.169> let's<00:04:33.160> say<00:04:33.370> the<00:04:33.520> bet<00:04:33.699> was

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
a simple formula let's say the bet was

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.600 
a simple formula let's say the bet was
100<00:04:34.419> gold<00:04:34.660> we<00:04:35.289> then<00:04:35.500> have<00:04:35.650> two<00:04:35.800> times<00:04:36.130> this<00:04:36.400> by

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
100 gold we then have two times this by

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.659 
100 gold we then have two times this by
45<00:04:37.300> and<00:04:37.630> then<00:04:38.139> divide<00:04:38.590> that<00:04:38.830> number<00:04:38.889> by<00:04:39.280> 100

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
45 and then divide that number by 100

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:41.879 
45 and then divide that number by 100
which<00:04:40.479> would<00:04:40.690> mean<00:04:40.870> the<00:04:41.050> cost<00:04:41.319> to<00:04:41.530> roll<00:04:41.740> in

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:41.889 
which would mean the cost to roll in

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:44.790 
which would mean the cost to roll in
this<00:04:42.099> case<00:04:42.370> would<00:04:42.880> be<00:04:42.940> 45<00:04:43.720> gold<00:04:44.080> and<00:04:44.349> this
