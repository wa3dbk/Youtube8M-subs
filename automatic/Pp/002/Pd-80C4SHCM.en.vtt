let's<00:00:27.829> take<00:00:27.980> a<00:00:28.009> really<00:00:28.489> quick<00:00:28.579> look<00:00:28.849> at<00:00:29.000> how<00:00:29.090> it

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:29.180 
let's take a really quick look at how it

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.720 
let's take a really quick look at how it
works<00:00:29.529> now<00:00:30.529> you<00:00:30.590> can<00:00:30.919> go<00:00:31.099> ahead<00:00:31.220> and<00:00:31.430> apply

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
works now you can go ahead and apply

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.479 
works now you can go ahead and apply
this<00:00:32.000> adjustment<00:00:32.750> right<00:00:33.050> to<00:00:33.260> footage<00:00:33.590> or<00:00:33.800> use

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
this adjustment right to footage or use

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:36.670 
this adjustment right to footage or use
it<00:00:34.520> as<00:00:34.790> an<00:00:35.060> adjustment<00:00:35.450> layer<00:00:35.600> I'm<00:00:36.440> going<00:00:36.620> to

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
it as an adjustment layer I'm going to

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.200 
it as an adjustment layer I'm going to
go<00:00:36.769> ahead<00:00:36.859> and<00:00:37.039> use<00:00:37.430> the<00:00:37.609> adjustment<00:00:38.149> layer

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
go ahead and use the adjustment layer

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.670 
go ahead and use the adjustment layer
option<00:00:38.840> because<00:00:39.019> I<00:00:39.079> find<00:00:39.350> that<00:00:39.440> to<00:00:39.500> be<00:00:39.649> a

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
option because I find that to be a

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.979 
option because I find that to be a
little<00:00:39.980> more<00:00:40.129> flexible<00:00:40.670> we<00:00:41.480> can<00:00:41.629> then<00:00:41.750> choose

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
little more flexible we can then choose

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.209 
little more flexible we can then choose
effects<00:00:43.210> synthetic<00:00:44.210> aperture<00:00:44.679> color<00:00:45.679> finesse

00:00:46.209 --> 00:00:46.219 
effects synthetic aperture color finesse

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:49.810 
effects synthetic aperture color finesse
and<00:00:46.809> this<00:00:47.809> applies<00:00:48.170> it<00:00:48.500> and<00:00:48.649> you<00:00:48.920> see<00:00:49.219> that<00:00:49.519> by

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
and this applies it and you see that by

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.970 
and this applies it and you see that by
default<00:00:50.000> nothing<00:00:50.660> happens<00:00:51.050> and<00:00:51.230> that's<00:00:51.679> on

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
default nothing happens and that's on

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.130 
default nothing happens and that's on
purpose<00:00:52.190> when<00:00:52.820> you<00:00:52.910> apply<00:00:53.269> a<00:00:53.300> color<00:00:53.629> grading

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
purpose when you apply a color grading

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.410 
purpose when you apply a color grading
effect<00:00:54.440> nothing<00:00:55.100> should<00:00:55.339> happen<00:00:55.399> until<00:00:55.910> you

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
effect nothing should happen until you

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.930 
effect nothing should happen until you
start<00:00:56.660> to<00:00:56.749> tweak<00:00:56.960> it<00:00:57.140> now<00:00:58.039> if<00:00:58.219> you<00:00:58.339> twirl<00:00:58.699> down

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
start to tweak it now if you twirl down

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.360 
start to tweak it now if you twirl down
here<00:00:59.269> you<00:00:59.420> can<00:00:59.539> get<00:00:59.629> a<00:00:59.660> simplified<00:01:00.530> sort<00:01:01.280> of

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
here you can get a simplified sort of

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.369 
here you can get a simplified sort of
interface<00:01:01.879> and<00:01:02.120> this<00:01:02.510> allows<00:01:02.839> you<00:01:03.109> to<00:01:03.199> go

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
interface and this allows you to go

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:06.190 
interface and this allows you to go
after<00:01:03.589> the<00:01:03.920> shadows<00:01:04.699> or<00:01:05.210> the<00:01:05.330> highlights<00:01:05.870> here

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
after the shadows or the highlights here

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.440 
after the shadows or the highlights here
and<00:01:06.409> notice<00:01:07.159> how<00:01:07.190> we<00:01:07.430> could<00:01:07.730> be<00:01:07.820> changing<00:01:08.330> the

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
and notice how we could be changing the

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.060 
and notice how we could be changing the
color<00:01:08.750> balance<00:01:09.230> for<00:01:09.380> different<00:01:09.650> areas<00:01:09.860> so<00:01:09.980> in

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
color balance for different areas so in

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.830 
color balance for different areas so in
this<00:01:10.130> case<00:01:10.340> putting<00:01:10.970> a<00:01:11.030> little<00:01:11.150> bit<00:01:11.300> more<00:01:11.450> blue

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
this case putting a little bit more blue

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.440 
this case putting a little bit more blue
into<00:01:12.200> the<00:01:12.290> shadows<00:01:12.770> and<00:01:13.010> a<00:01:13.730> little<00:01:13.970> more<00:01:14.090> read

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
into the shadows and a little more read

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.720 
into the shadows and a little more read
into<00:01:14.810> the<00:01:15.080> highlights<00:01:15.530> to<00:01:15.800> warm<00:01:16.220> those<00:01:16.430> up<00:01:16.460> a

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:16.730 
into the highlights to warm those up a

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.630 
into the highlights to warm those up a
bit<00:01:16.940> or<00:01:17.600> the<00:01:17.630> mid-tones<00:01:18.260> there<00:01:18.620> and<00:01:18.830> notice

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
bit or the mid-tones there and notice

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.340 
bit or the mid-tones there and notice
how<00:01:19.850> we<00:01:19.910> can<00:01:20.120> go<00:01:20.270> after<00:01:20.690> and<00:01:20.870> make<00:01:21.020> a<00:01:21.050> pretty

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
how we can go after and make a pretty

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.950 
how we can go after and make a pretty
pronounced<00:01:21.890> adjustment<00:01:22.400> you<00:01:23.330> also<00:01:23.510> have<00:01:23.840> an

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
pronounced adjustment you also have an

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.290 
pronounced adjustment you also have an
auto<00:01:24.260> option<00:01:24.890> that<00:01:25.160> will<00:01:25.280> analyze<00:01:25.820> the<00:01:26.030> image

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
auto option that will analyze the image

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.480 
auto option that will analyze the image
and<00:01:26.450> attempt<00:01:26.900> to<00:01:26.960> fix<00:01:27.290> color<00:01:27.710> and<00:01:28.010> exposure

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
and attempt to fix color and exposure

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.940 
and attempt to fix color and exposure
for<00:01:29.060> you<00:01:29.270> let's<00:01:30.080> go<00:01:30.230> ahead<00:01:30.410> and<00:01:30.500> just<00:01:30.590> reset

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
for you let's go ahead and just reset

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.650 
for you let's go ahead and just reset
that<00:01:31.100> quickly<00:01:31.400> another<00:01:32.000> thing<00:01:32.210> that<00:01:32.240> I<00:01:32.360> really

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:32.660 
that quickly another thing that I really

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.780 
that quickly another thing that I really
like<00:01:32.840> is<00:01:32.870> the<00:01:33.080> ability<00:01:33.350> to<00:01:33.590> click<00:01:33.800> load<00:01:34.160> preset

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
like is the ability to click load preset

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.160 
like is the ability to click load preset
and<00:01:35.000> this<00:01:35.300> actually<00:01:35.660> lets<00:01:35.840> you<00:01:35.930> go<00:01:36.110> to

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
and this actually lets you go to

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.690 
and this actually lets you go to
particular<00:01:36.800> color<00:01:37.040> settings<00:01:37.460> that<00:01:37.580> you've

all sorts of other controls hsl RGB and
a<00:02:04.550> great<00:02:04.940> limiter<00:02:05.480> that<00:02:05.930> allows<00:02:06.230> you<00:02:06.440> to<00:02:06.470> go

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
a great limiter that allows you to go

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.729 
a great limiter that allows you to go
ahead<00:02:06.830> and<00:02:07.370> set<00:02:07.850> broadcast<00:02:08.660> limiting<00:02:09.170> so<00:02:09.590> this

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
ahead and set broadcast limiting so this

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:11.229 
ahead and set broadcast limiting so this
isn't<00:02:10.009> going<00:02:10.129> to<00:02:10.190> be<00:02:10.280> too<00:02:10.310> bright<00:02:10.819> for<00:02:11.090> a

isn't going to be too bright for a
particular<00:02:11.390> color<00:02:11.959> system<00:02:12.280> but<00:02:13.280> the<00:02:13.310> coolest

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
particular color system but the coolest

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.020 
particular color system but the coolest
thing<00:02:14.000> is<00:02:14.180> this<00:02:14.750> color<00:02:15.680> finesse<00:02:16.130> has<00:02:16.370> its<00:02:16.580> own
