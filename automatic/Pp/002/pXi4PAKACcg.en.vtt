black homes are hollow grind with a
stretch<00:01:37.380> on<00:01:37.560> top<00:01:39.320> you<00:01:40.320> can<00:01:40.470> also<00:01:40.670> open<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.820> with

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:50.569 
stretch on top you can also open it with
the<00:01:42.649> thumb<00:01:43.649> step<00:01:44.960> but<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:47.000> prefer<00:01:48.649> open<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:49.799> with

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
the thumb step but I prefer open it with

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.460 
the thumb step but I prefer open it with
a<00:01:50.939> flipper<00:01:51.210> it's<00:01:52.020> much<00:01:52.649> faster<00:01:52.860> and

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
a flipper it's much faster and

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:00.300 
a flipper it's much faster and
effortless

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.580 

the<00:02:01.310> way<00:02:01.520> it<00:02:01.580> is<00:02:01.790> about<00:02:02.060> I<00:02:02.600> don't<00:02:03.260> have<00:02:03.470> the

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
the way it is about I don't have the

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.480 
the way it is about I don't have the
exact<00:02:03.890> weight<00:02:04.180> but<00:02:05.180> I<00:02:05.210> think<00:02:05.630> it's<00:02:06.460> close<00:02:07.460> to

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
exact weight but I think it's close to

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.550 
exact weight but I think it's close to
five<00:02:08.060> point<00:02:08.590> five<00:02:09.590> five<00:02:10.340> point<00:02:10.580> six<00:02:11.260> for<00:02:12.260> the

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
five point five five point six for the

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.850 
five point five five point six for the
four<00:02:13.040> ablative<00:02:13.520> size<00:02:13.900> it's<00:02:14.900> actually<00:02:15.320> not

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
four ablative size it's actually not

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.790 
four ablative size it's actually not
that<00:02:15.920> heavy<00:02:16.540> because<00:02:17.540> this<00:02:17.900> this<00:02:18.440> thing<00:02:18.680> is

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
that heavy because this this thing is

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:27.900 
that heavy because this this thing is
huge<00:02:19.010> I<00:02:19.480> have<00:02:20.480> a<00:02:20.510> medium<00:02:20.960> to<00:02:21.260> large<00:02:21.500> hands<00:02:22.010> and

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.900 

carriage<00:02:28.910> verify<00:02:29.330> in<00:02:29.390> the<00:02:29.540> pocket<00:02:29.870> but<00:02:30.910> it's

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
carriage verify in the pocket but it's

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.530 
carriage verify in the pocket but it's
really<00:02:32.090> strong<00:02:32.770> noble<00:02:33.770> I<00:02:33.980> played<00:02:34.250> absolutely

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:43.330 

and<00:02:38.540> come<00:02:38.780> comes<00:02:39.260> extremely<00:02:39.620> sharp<00:02:42.250> there's<00:02:43.250> a

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
and come comes extremely sharp there's a

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.740 
and come comes extremely sharp there's a
special<00:02:44.000> feature<00:02:45.010> that<00:02:46.010> I<00:02:46.070> don't<00:02:46.310> see<00:02:46.490> in<00:02:46.750> many

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
special feature that I don't see in many

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:54.100 
special feature that I don't see in many
knives<00:02:48.520> which<00:02:49.520> is<00:02:49.820> a<00:02:50.860> stainless<00:02:52.120> insert<00:02:53.120> for

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110

the<00:02:55.630> lock<00:02:56.630> bar<00:02:57.760> the<00:02:58.760> reason<00:02:59.120> behind<00:02:59.240> that<00:02:59.600> I'm

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
the lock bar the reason behind that I'm

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.330 
the lock bar the reason behind that I'm
really<00:03:00.890> sure<00:03:01.250> but<00:03:01.580> I<00:03:01.610> think<00:03:01.730> it<00:03:02.890> so<00:03:03.890> the<00:03:04.070> blade

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
really sure but I think it so the blade

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:10.510 
really sure but I think it so the blade
doesn't<00:03:04.580> need<00:03:04.850> up<00:03:05.030> the<00:03:06.640> titanium<00:03:09.340> every<00:03:10.340> time

blasted<00:04:04.660> same<00:04:05.660> as<00:04:05.870> with<00:04:06.140> the<00:04:06.580> screws<00:04:10.900> it<00:04:11.900> I

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
blasted same as with the screws it I

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.270 
blasted same as with the screws it I
think<00:04:13.910> it<00:04:14.180> has<00:04:14.420> the<00:04:14.450> a<00:04:14.930> really<00:04:15.440> nice<00:04:15.650> detail<00:04:15.920> in

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
think it has the a really nice detail in

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.920 
think it has the a really nice detail in
it

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:26.170 

by<00:04:21.470> the<00:04:21.530> time<00:04:21.829> of<00:04:21.889> these<00:04:23.770> preview<00:04:24.790> they<00:04:25.790> are

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
by the time of these preview they are

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.390 
by the time of these preview they are
all<00:04:26.780> sold<00:04:27.169> out<00:04:29.770> but<00:04:30.770> I<00:04:30.830> think<00:04:30.979> they<00:04:31.190> are<00:04:31.220> going

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
all sold out but I think they are going

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.110 
all sold out but I think they are going
to<00:04:31.490> make<00:04:31.990> another<00:04:32.990> batch<00:04:33.229> so<00:04:34.009> you<00:04:34.729> can<00:04:34.910> get

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
to make another batch so you can get

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:41.370 
to make another batch so you can get
onto<00:04:35.270> the<00:04:35.570> website<00:04:35.600> and<00:04:36.160> pre-order<00:04:37.160> it

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.999

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:46.009 
the blade is completely completely hand

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:53.020 
the blade is completely completely hand
grounded<00:04:46.460> by<00:04:46.850> the<00:04:46.910> maker<00:04:49.150> only<00:04:50.150> the<00:04:51.759> the<00:04:52.759> the

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
grounded by the maker only the the the

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:58.870 
grounded by the maker only the the the
handle<00:04:53.470> it's<00:04:54.490> CNC<00:04:55.690> out<00:04:56.690> sourced<00:04:57.520> but<00:04:58.520> they

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
handle it's CNC out sourced but they

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:04.689 
handle it's CNC out sourced but they
also<00:04:59.410> under<00:05:00.580> detent<00:05:01.580> skills<00:05:03.039> but<00:05:04.039> most<00:05:04.340> part

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:04.699 
also under detent skills but most part

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:09.760 
also under detent skills but most part
these<00:05:05.419> nine<00:05:05.720> bits<00:05:06.020> are<00:05:08.050> they<00:05:09.050> call<00:05:09.260> it<00:05:09.380> meat

tech<00:05:10.100> but<00:05:10.910> I<00:05:10.960> for<00:05:11.960> me<00:05:12.110> it's<00:05:12.320> a<00:05:12.410> custom<00:05:12.830> because

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
tech but I for me it's a custom because

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.790 
tech but I for me it's a custom because
they<00:05:14.270> put<00:05:14.449> a<00:05:14.510> lot<00:05:14.690> of<00:05:14.840> work<00:05:15.050> in<00:05:15.229> it<00:05:15.380> it's<00:05:15.680> not

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
they put a lot of work in it it's not

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.499 
they put a lot of work in it it's not
just<00:05:18.430> everything<00:05:19.430> else<00:05:19.520> hoes<00:05:19.820> and<00:05:20.150> they<00:05:20.300> just

just everything else hoes and they just

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:24.520 
just everything else hoes and they just
put<00:05:20.900> it<00:05:20.990> together<00:05:21.490> they<00:05:22.490> may<00:05:23.169> put<00:05:24.169> a<00:05:24.199> lot<00:05:24.410> of

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530

bar<00:05:24.740> working<00:05:25.099> it<00:05:26.199> one<00:05:27.199> thing<00:05:27.440> I<00:05:27.740> think<00:05:28.130> I<00:05:30.400> have

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 
bar working it one thing I think I have

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.080 
bar working it one thing I think I have
problem<00:05:31.789> with<00:05:31.820> with<00:05:32.690> it<00:05:32.930> the<00:05:33.490> its<00:05:34.490> unlocking

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.090 
problem with with it the its unlocking

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:39.070 
problem with with it the its unlocking
the<00:05:35.380> lock<00:05:36.380> bar<00:05:37.120> because<00:05:38.120> everything<00:05:38.900> is<00:05:38.990> so

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
the lock bar because everything is so

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.550 
the lock bar because everything is so
smooth<00:05:39.440> here<00:05:39.680> and<00:05:40.840> so<00:05:41.840> you<00:05:41.930> have<00:05:42.080> to<00:05:42.169> really

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 
smooth here and so you have to really

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.790 
smooth here and so you have to really
get<00:05:42.830> into<00:05:43.010> it<00:05:43.479> to<00:05:44.479> unlock<00:05:44.659> it<00:05:45.050> but<00:05:45.590> I<00:05:45.650> don't

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 
get into it to unlock it but I don't

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.379 
get into it to unlock it but I don't
think<00:05:46.039> that<00:05:46.220> that's<00:05:46.729> outside<00:05:47.330> because

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:49.389 
think that that's outside because

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:54.670 
think that that's outside because
prevent<00:05:50.389> you<00:05:50.539> from<00:05:50.650> unlocking<00:05:51.650> it<00:05:53.260> by<00:05:54.260> by

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 
prevent you from unlocking it by by

00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:02.520 
prevent you from unlocking it by by
accident

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:02.530 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:09.840 

I<00:06:02.560> think<00:06:03.220> it's<00:06:03.370> people<00:06:03.580> or<00:06:07.680> mr.<00:06:08.680> Alicia<00:06:09.670> with

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:09.850 
I think it's people or mr. Alicia with

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:16.730 
I think it's people or mr. Alicia with
design<00:06:14.220> and<00:06:15.220> if<00:06:15.430> I'm<00:06:15.580> not<00:06:15.730> being<00:06:15.940> mistaken

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:16.740 
design and if I'm not being mistaken

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:24.810 
design and if I'm not being mistaken
this<00:06:17.740> is<00:06:17.980> a<00:06:18.480> mr.<00:06:19.480> George<00:06:19.720> first<00:06:20.370> flipper<00:06:23.820> he

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:24.820 
this is a mr. George first flipper he

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:32.170 
this is a mr. George first flipper he
makes<00:06:25.030> an<00:06:25.210> excellent<00:06:25.660> knife

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:32.180 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:51.450 

perfectly<00:06:33.180> centered<00:06:38.330> lining<00:06:39.330> fast<00:06:39.600> action

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:51.460 

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.180 

oh<00:06:51.870> no<00:06:52.870> jimping<00:06:53.320> but<00:06:53.620> I<00:06:53.650> don't<00:06:53.860> think<00:06:54.070> it's

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:54.190 
oh no jimping but I don't think it's

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:56.730 
oh no jimping but I don't think it's
needed<00:06:54.490> because<00:06:55.300> the<00:06:55.690> the<00:06:55.990> blades<00:06:56.230> actually

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:56.740 
needed because the the blades actually

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:01.280 
needed because the the blades actually
below<00:06:57.730> the<00:06:57.760> handle<00:06:58.290> there's<00:06:59.290> a<00:06:59.350> little<00:06:59.710> bit<00:06:59.860> of

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:01.290 
below the handle there's a little bit of

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:17.629 
below the handle there's a little bit of
upward<00:07:02.370> design<00:07:03.370> here<00:07:11.280> works<00:07:12.280> fine<00:07:12.520> actually
