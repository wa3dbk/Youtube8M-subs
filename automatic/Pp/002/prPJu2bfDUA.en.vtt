00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.930 
I do not adapt that philosophy because
it<00:04:00.480> is<00:04:00.600> very<00:04:00.660> hypocritical<00:04:01.280> now<00:04:02.280> do<00:04:02.340> i<00:04:02.610> condemn

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
it is very hypocritical now do i condemn

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.050 
it is very hypocritical now do i condemn
backbreaker<00:04:03.720> I<00:04:03.840> do<00:04:04.020> not<00:04:04.380> I've<00:04:05.280> given<00:04:05.820> it<00:04:05.940> its

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
credit I've also picked out the flaws so

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.030 
credit I've also picked out the flaws so
I<00:04:09.300> hope<00:04:09.480> people<00:04:09.840> understand<00:04:10.290> exactly<00:04:10.440> what's

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
I hope people understand exactly what's

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.340 
I hope people understand exactly what's

reason<00:04:13.739> you<00:04:13.829> can't<00:04:14.070> give<00:04:14.250> back<00:04:14.489> breaker

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
reason you can't give back breaker

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.180 
reason you can't give back breaker
us<00:04:15.450> because<00:04:16.019> there's<00:04:16.410> a<00:04:16.470> logical<00:04:16.950> fallacy

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
being compared to matted will turn

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.720 
being compared to matted will turn
around<00:04:56.550> and<00:04:57.000> say<00:04:57.210> well<00:04:57.960> you<00:04:58.530> can't<00:04:58.890> compare<00:04:59.460> it

00:04:59.720 --> 00:04:59.730 
around and say well you can't compare it

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:02.240 
around and say well you can't compare it
to<00:04:59.940> Madame<00:05:00.390> it's<00:05:00.750> his<00:05:00.900> first<00:05:01.169> season<00:05:01.620> you

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
to Madame it's his first season you

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.460 
to Madame it's his first season you
can't<00:05:02.520> be<00:05:02.640> too<00:05:02.850> hard<00:05:03.150> on<00:05:03.360> the<00:05:03.480> game<00:05:03.690> you<00:05:04.260> have

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
can't be too hard on the game you have

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.420 
can't be too hard on the game you have
to<00:05:04.500> give<00:05:04.830> it<00:05:04.980> a<00:05:05.040> pass<00:05:05.280> I<00:05:05.700> find<00:05:06.090> that<00:05:06.270> very<00:05:06.330> very

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
to give it a pass I find that very very

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.360 
to give it a pass I find that very very
funny<00:05:08.430> and<00:05:09.330> my<00:05:09.570> last<00:05:09.810> reason<00:05:10.140> why<00:05:10.530> backbreaker

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
funny and my last reason why backbreaker

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.150 
funny and my last reason why backbreaker
does<00:05:11.940> not<00:05:12.150> deserve<00:05:12.570> and<00:05:12.780> pass<00:05:12.990> is<00:05:13.650> because

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
does not deserve and pass is because

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.370 
does not deserve and pass is because
once<00:05:14.580> you<00:05:14.730> give<00:05:14.940> it<00:05:15.120> a<00:05:15.210> pass<00:05:15.390> its<00:05:15.750> first<00:05:16.050> year

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
once you give it a pass its first year

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.530 
once you give it a pass its first year
then<00:05:16.890> you'll<00:05:17.130> give<00:05:17.370> it<00:05:17.490> a<00:05:17.580> pass<00:05:17.760> at<00:05:18.090> second

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:18.540 
then you'll give it a pass at second

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.020 
then you'll give it a pass at second
year<00:05:18.780> then<00:05:19.680> you'll<00:05:19.890> give<00:05:20.100> it<00:05:20.220> a<00:05:20.280> pass<00:05:20.490> in<00:05:20.760> third

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
year then you'll give it a pass in third

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.810 
year then you'll give it a pass in third
year<00:05:21.180> and<00:05:21.750> then<00:05:22.500> its<00:05:22.710> fourth<00:05:23.010> year<00:05:23.100> and<00:05:23.550> then

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820 
year and then its fourth year and then

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.670 
year and then its fourth year and then
its<00:05:24.030> fifth<00:05:24.300> year<00:05:24.390> and<00:05:24.810> it's<00:05:25.169> another<00:05:25.410> reason

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
its fifth year and it's another reason

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.760 
its fifth year and it's another reason
why<00:05:25.950> Madden<00:05:26.520> is<00:05:26.669> in<00:05:26.820> the<00:05:26.940> shape<00:05:27.180> it's<00:05:27.390> in

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
why Madden is in the shape it's in

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.620 
why Madden is in the shape it's in
because<00:05:28.770> people<00:05:29.100> kept<00:05:29.310> giving<00:05:29.550> it<00:05:29.820> passes<00:05:30.330> and

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630 
because people kept giving it passes and

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.320 
because people kept giving it passes and
once<00:05:30.840> you<00:05:30.990> give<00:05:31.169> it<00:05:31.320> a<00:05:31.380> pass<00:05:31.669> then<00:05:32.669> where<00:05:33.120> does

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 
once you give it a pass then where does

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.510 
once you give it a pass then where does
it<00:05:33.390> stop<00:05:33.720> when<00:05:34.560> do<00:05:34.770> you<00:05:34.800> then<00:05:35.070> make<00:05:35.370> the

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 
it stop when do you then make the

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.590 
it stop when do you then make the
decision<00:05:36.030> to<00:05:36.060> withdraw<00:05:36.390> on<00:05:36.870> the<00:05:37.110> passes
