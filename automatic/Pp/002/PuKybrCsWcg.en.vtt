 yes 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:24.330
 this side the reason to all logic of 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.090
 street where there are findings of hours of 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.920
 agave cooking processes 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.150
 distillation clay pots that have been 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.340
 found because a lot of people say that 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.410
 the distillation arrived in mexico with the 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.850
 Spaniards arrived since 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.960
 thousands of years ago there was already 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.700
 mud distillation that currently in 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.110
 other places tutoring occurs from 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.110
 this rudimentary form 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:55.160
 he is one of the teachers who worked 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.160
 a lot with wild 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:07.350

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.490
 who work with with serious crumb 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.750
 wild storm of all crises 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.940
 I would see the quality of the sagas 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.850
 that we have take wasp dimes and 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:22.110

 yellowish they have look like mango 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:30.390
 premium agave that we started to 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.280
 feel anything in this crop that we're going to 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.180
 start producing excellent mix not 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.920
 for the liberators 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.320
 maritza I do not know our idea 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.270
 fertilizers simply fertilizers 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.510
 organic or livestock manure 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.820
 that's why they are serious and grow from 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.740
 not organic way and there also the 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.220
 quality of the merchants that are 100% 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.220
