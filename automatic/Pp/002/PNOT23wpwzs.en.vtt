00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.060
 ah ah 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.580
 hello to all and lease no case I hope 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.990
 that you're fine 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.630
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.490
 new video on gta 5 online for 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.329
 open our gifts remember you I 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.369
 you made a little video 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:27.109
 previously for you to inform you 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.810
 in fact that rockstar for the day of 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:31.519
 Christmas was going to surprise us 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.900
 and it's time we got them in 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:34.400
 plus what is really practical 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.050
 is that if ever you can not 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.760
 play today you just have to you 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.320
 connect about 3 minutes and you 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.089
 receive your gifts that you do not have 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.230
 no need to play an hour to go 

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:44.000
 look for crates or stuff like 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.559
 that's what it really gives itself 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.629
 automatically as soon as you log in 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:48.710
 so here it is gone look and we will 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:50.449
 discover that together 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.399
 so here I logged in and look 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:54.530
 I will receive my gifts so here we 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:56.359
 can see that we get a low mask 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.949
 so as debate sticks in my opinion 

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:59.030
 it's the red mask that I had you 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:00.530
 presented in video 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.170
 so we had a little leak 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.449
 then here we get protection 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.920
 bulletproof so a bulletproof vest 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.330
 three proximity mines so which are 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.759
 the new little bombs that had 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.899
 in the christmas dlc then there are some 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:13.520
 three molotov cocktails 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:15.590
 then here we have a launcher 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.570
 pyrotechnic with five fireworks 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.979
 that's really not bad for 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.810
 those who did not buy him 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.790
 have it free and for those who already have 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.360
 bought you will have 5 fireworks that 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.400
 is really cool 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.909
 then here we also get with that a 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.619
 rifle with 200 bullets will not say that 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:31.880
 it's just little things but 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.409
 frankly it's nice we did not 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.610
 buy them and it's always cool 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:36.619
 to have small gifts like that of 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.909
 little more we'll say in a game it's 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:40.189
 it's nice to see that they think about 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.350
 we and so here it is left looked at gvt 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:44.240
 and in the menu incidental interactions 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.100
 there I go in mass and I'm going 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.030
 look for my new mask look 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.770
 frankly I find it really 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.500
 beautiful too stylish for robberies 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.000
 it's okay it's going to really make stylus and 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.780
 So here we come to the end of this 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.490
 video as I tell you frankly 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.200
 it's really fast to receive your 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.729
 gifts you connect three 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.469
 minutes to break everything and you go 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.210
 receive a little message like what 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:03.890
 rockstar offers you gifts for this 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.869
 day and frankly we will not spit 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.520
 above and here we come to the end of 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.630
 this video so you if these little ones 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.369
 gifts made you happy 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.590
 not to let go a little blue thumb on the 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.120
 video to show it do not hesitate no 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.380
 more to say in comment what you 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.959
 so think of what they gave us 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.639
 bulletproof vest pyrotechnic launcher 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.180
 proximity mines frankly I feel 

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:22.650
 that it's stuff that's still 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.200
 it's cool they could have been 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.129
 offer the new missile launcher to 70 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.290
 thousand dollars maybe it's the small 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:28.769
 all negative let's say I 'm said 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.390
 could offer it 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.980
 and so that's me I 'll leave you 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.090
 on these images I say them I hope 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.980
 really that this little video you 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.439
 will have pleased me I wanted it is on these 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.299
 images take advantage of this dlc which is this 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:40.349

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:41.909
