paid<00:00:30.660> job<00:00:30.689> ever<00:00:32.059> it<00:00:33.059> looks<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.360> lot<00:00:33.480> better<00:00:33.540> from

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
paid job ever it looks a lot better from

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.020 
paid job ever it looks a lot better from
a<00:00:33.930> distance<00:00:33.980> but<00:00:34.980> it's<00:00:35.280> not<00:00:35.460> bad

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
a distance but it's not bad

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.389 
a distance but it's not bad
I<00:00:36.059> used<00:00:36.390> dirt<00:00:36.690> coat<00:00:36.989> actually<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.829> dirt<00:00:38.100> bake

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
I used dirt coat actually the dirt bake

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.500 
I used dirt coat actually the dirt bake
and<00:00:38.780> I<00:00:39.800> put<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.980> shock<00:00:41.370> wave<00:00:41.640> technologies

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
and I put the shock wave technologies

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.700 
and I put the shock wave technologies
Raptor<00:00:43.110> grip<00:00:43.379> on<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.809> this<00:00:45.809> makes<00:00:46.469> this

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
Raptor grip on it and this makes this

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
using dummy rounds this is something

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.350 
using dummy rounds this is something
that<00:00:51.690> I<00:00:52.079> actually<00:00:52.260> do<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.559> review<00:00:52.949> on<00:00:53.360> Brownells

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
that I actually do a review on Brownells

let's<00:01:16.259> go<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.590> my<00:01:16.799> modifications<00:01:17.220> here<00:01:17.909> first

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
let's go to my modifications here first

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.630 
let's go to my modifications here first
modification<00:01:19.080> is<00:01:19.650> I<00:01:19.799> put<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.040> shock<00:01:20.430> wave

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
modification is I put a shock wave

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.899 
modification is I put a shock wave
technologies<00:01:21.509> raptor<00:01:22.229> grip<00:01:22.500> on<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:22.979> this

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
technologies raptor grip on it and this

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.490 
technologies raptor grip on it and this
greatly<00:01:24.659> reduces<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.560> recoil<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:27.140> in<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.320> to

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
greatly reduces the recoil and in it to

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.609 
greatly reduces the recoil and in it to
me<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.710> just<00:01:28.829> looks<00:01:29.100> cooler<00:01:29.369> but<00:01:30.380> I'll<00:01:31.380> put<00:01:31.560> a

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
me it just looks cooler but I'll put a

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.590 
me it just looks cooler but I'll put a
link<00:01:31.799> up<00:01:32.009> where<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.340> can<00:01:32.610> take<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.240> look<00:01:33.450> at

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
link up where you can take a look at

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.710 
link up where you can take a look at
that<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.710> also<00:01:35.100> on<00:01:35.400> shockwave<00:01:35.970> technologies

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
that and also on shockwave technologies

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.890 
that and also on shockwave technologies
they<00:01:36.960> actually<00:01:37.439> show<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:37.909> how<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:38.970> do<00:01:39.720> this

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
they actually show you how to do this

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.010 
they actually show you how to do this
modification<00:01:40.320> now<00:01:41.220> I<00:01:41.280> paid<00:01:41.670> in<00:01:41.820> mine<00:01:42.060> with

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
modification now I paid in mine with

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.190 
modification now I paid in mine with
dura<00:01:43.290> bake<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:44.399> it<00:01:45.270> turned<00:01:45.570> out<00:01:45.720> really<00:01:45.780> good

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
dura bake and it turned out really good

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.200 
dura bake and it turned out really good
for<00:01:46.439> my<00:01:46.530> first<00:01:46.710> paint<00:01:47.040> job<00:01:47.310> ever<00:01:47.640> in<00:01:47.880> my<00:01:47.970> entire

inch<00:02:03.750> barrel<00:02:04.020> now<00:02:04.829> I'm<00:02:05.159> not<00:02:05.340> going<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.549> get

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
inch barrel now I'm not going to get

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.229 
inch barrel now I'm not going to get
into<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:05.880> legalities<00:02:06.600> of<00:02:06.630> this<00:02:07.079> whole<00:02:08.239> barrel

when you get to the magazine tube it's
very<00:03:25.920> difficult<00:03:26.430> because<00:03:26.910> they<00:03:27.180> have<00:03:27.360> this

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
very difficult because they have this

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.930 
very difficult because they have this
thing<00:03:27.810> sealed<00:03:28.350> and<00:03:28.680> there<00:03:29.100> is<00:03:29.250> no<00:03:29.430> way<00:03:29.610> you<00:03:29.670> can

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
you might need to use a vise and just

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.120 
you might need to use a vise and just
always<00:03:44.490> remember<00:03:45.090> that<00:03:45.740> towards<00:03:46.740> the<00:03:46.920> end

always remember that towards the end

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.430 
always remember that towards the end
here<00:03:47.490> it's<00:03:47.760> going<00:03:47.910> to<00:03:47.970> be<00:03:48.090> a<00:03:48.120> lot<00:03:48.360> tougher<00:03:48.660> if

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440
