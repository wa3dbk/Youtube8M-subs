into the run box and you don't have

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.899 
into the run box and you don't have
doing<00:01:16.110> that<00:01:16.229> quite<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.439> lot<00:01:16.530> but<00:01:17.520> they're<00:01:17.729> all

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
doing that quite a lot but they're all

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.030 
doing that quite a lot but they're all
in<00:01:18.180> one<00:01:18.420> place<00:01:18.570> about<00:01:18.990> device<00:01:19.259> manager<00:01:19.710> of<00:01:19.920> our

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
in one place about device manager of our

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.550 
in one place about device manager of our
services<00:01:20.580> or<00:01:21.150> computer<00:01:21.600> management<00:01:21.900> here<00:01:22.350> and

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
services or computer management here and

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.320 
services or computer management here and
it's<00:01:23.100> all<00:01:23.310> in<00:01:23.549> one<00:01:23.700> place<00:01:23.820> they<00:01:24.150> obviously

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
it's all in one place they obviously

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.539 
it's all in one place they obviously
have<00:01:24.689> their<00:01:24.840> own<00:01:24.900> little<00:01:24.960> drop<00:01:25.350> downs<00:01:25.590> if<00:01:25.920> you

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
have their own little drop downs if you

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.060 
have their own little drop downs if you
need<00:01:26.759> under<00:01:27.390> their<00:01:27.600> specific<00:01:28.380> category<00:01:28.829> so

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
need under their specific category so

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.980 
need under their specific category so
that<00:01:29.640> pretty<00:01:29.790> much<00:01:29.909> covers<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.659> be<00:01:30.750> honest

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
that pretty much covers it to be honest
