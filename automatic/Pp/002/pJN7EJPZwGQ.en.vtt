the hay feeder out of a 55-gallon drum
that's<00:00:34.890> thrown<00:00:35.219> away<00:00:35.450> it<00:00:36.450> is<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.750> little<00:00:37.020> bit

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
that's thrown away it is a little bit

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.869 
that's thrown away it is a little bit
too<00:00:38.340> wide<00:00:38.579> right<00:00:39.030> here<00:00:40.430> let<00:00:41.430> me<00:00:41.460> get<00:00:41.730> up<00:00:41.850> here

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
too wide right here let me get up here

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.180 
too wide right here let me get up here
you<00:00:42.600> notice<00:00:42.899> this<00:00:43.320> is<00:00:43.500> where<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.770> goat<00:00:43.980> will

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
you notice this is where the goat will

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.240 
you notice this is where the goat will
put<00:00:44.340> its<00:00:44.489> head<00:00:44.700> in<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.710> slide<00:00:46.710> her<00:00:46.860> neck<00:00:47.039> down

put its head in and slide her neck down

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.630 
put its head in and slide her neck down
here<00:00:47.750> so<00:00:48.750> she<00:00:48.780> cannot<00:00:49.200> easily<00:00:49.559> draw<00:00:50.129> her<00:00:50.370> head

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.330 
here so she cannot easily draw her head
out<00:00:51.199> now<00:00:52.199> I'm<00:00:52.289> going<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.530> narrow<00:00:52.739> this<00:00:53.010> up<00:00:53.219> a

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
out now I'm going to narrow this up a

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.369 
out now I'm going to narrow this up a
little<00:00:53.460> bit<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:54.180> actually<00:00:54.449> only<00:00:54.899> needs<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.350> be

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
little bit it actually only needs to be

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.160 
little bit it actually only needs to be
about<00:00:56.000> three<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.180> half<00:00:57.210> four<00:00:57.719> inches<00:00:58.109> wide

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
about three and a half four inches wide

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.580 
about three and a half four inches wide
I<00:00:58.410> got<00:00:58.859> it<00:00:58.980> too<00:00:59.160> wide<00:00:59.690> but<00:01:00.690> if<00:01:01.020> you<00:01:01.170> narrow<00:01:01.440> it

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
I got it too wide but if you narrow it

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.139 
I got it too wide but if you narrow it
down<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.770> get<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.100> goat<00:01:02.520> we'll<00:01:02.699> put<00:01:02.850> its<00:01:03.000> head

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
down to get the goat we'll put its head

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.600 
down to get the goat we'll put its head
in<00:01:03.359> through<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.719> keyhole<00:01:04.110> get<00:01:04.979> down<00:01:05.189> into<00:01:05.430> the

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
in through the keyhole get down into the

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.810 
in through the keyhole get down into the
hay<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.710> therefore<00:01:07.710> she<00:01:08.100> can't<00:01:08.310> just<00:01:08.520> yank

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
hay and therefore she can't just yank

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.870 
hay and therefore she can't just yank
her<00:01:09.030> head<00:01:09.240> in<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.570> out<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:10.250> mean<00:01:11.250> she'll<00:01:11.430> have

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
her head in and out I mean she'll have

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.950 
her head in and out I mean she'll have
to<00:01:11.970> stand<00:01:12.240> up<00:01:12.420> on<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.900> brick<00:01:13.280> to<00:01:14.280> get<00:01:14.430> in<00:01:14.580> there

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
to stand up on the brick to get in there

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.270 
to stand up on the brick to get in there
go<00:01:15.960> ahead<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.259> demonstrate<00:01:16.409> for<00:01:16.979> us<00:01:17.009> goat

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
go ahead and demonstrate for us goat

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.160 
go ahead and demonstrate for us goat
she<00:01:20.280> goes<00:01:20.490> it's<00:01:21.479> kind<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.689> hard<00:01:21.900> for<00:01:21.930> her<00:01:22.110> to

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
she goes it's kind of hard for her to

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.070 
she goes it's kind of hard for her to
get<00:01:22.290> her<00:01:22.380> ears<00:01:22.619> in<00:01:23.210> so<00:01:24.210> instead<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:24.810> pulling

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
get her ears in so instead of pulling

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.810 
get her ears in so instead of pulling
her<00:01:25.259> head<00:01:25.439> in<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:25.950> out<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.159> just<00:01:26.310> dragging

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
her head in and out and just dragging

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.719 
her head in and out and just dragging
hay<00:01:27.000> out<00:01:27.560> she'll<00:01:28.560> eat<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.729> climb<00:01:30.540> in<00:01:31.729> that's

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
hay out she'll eat and climb in that's

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.609 
hay out she'll eat and climb in that's
why<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.000> need<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.360> make<00:01:33.509> that<00:01:33.689> that<00:01:34.590> a

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
why I need to make that that a

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.280 
why I need to make that that a
little<00:01:35.340> bit<00:01:35.490> narrower<00:01:35.869> but<00:01:36.869> as<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.140> can<00:01:37.229> see

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
little bit narrower but as you can see

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.230 
little bit narrower but as you can see
even<00:01:37.680> with<00:01:37.860> they're<00:01:38.159> trying<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.729> get<00:01:38.880> in<00:01:39.030> there

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
even with they're trying to get in there

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.020 
even with they're trying to get in there
like<00:01:39.420> that<00:01:39.890> it's<00:01:40.890> much<00:01:41.220> harder<00:01:41.490> for<00:01:41.670> her<00:01:42.000> to

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
like that it's much harder for her to

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.080 
like that it's much harder for her to
waste<00:01:42.329> hay<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:42.899> you<00:01:43.740> know<00:01:43.920> how<00:01:44.220> notorious
