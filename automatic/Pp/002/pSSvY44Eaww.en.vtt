past<00:00:37.090> about<00:00:37.510> halfway<00:00:37.900> through<00:00:38.110> season<00:00:38.739> two<00:00:38.830> so

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 
past about halfway through season two so

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.939 
past about halfway through season two so
now<00:00:40.420> that<00:00:40.480> that's<00:00:40.660> cleared<00:00:40.989> up<00:00:41.080> who<00:00:41.770> do<00:00:41.860> you

00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:41.949 
now that that's cleared up who do you

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:43.680 
now that that's cleared up who do you
play<00:00:42.100> the<00:00:42.250> role<00:00:42.340> of<00:00:42.400> a<00:00:42.879> guy<00:00:43.330> that's<00:00:43.570> not

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690 
play the role of a guy that's not

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.990 
play the role of a guy that's not
actually<00:00:43.930> in<00:00:44.170> the<00:00:44.260> show<00:00:44.470> which<00:00:45.280> I<00:00:45.550> really

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
actually in the show which I really

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.889 
actually in the show which I really
didn't<00:00:46.210> like<00:00:46.300> at<00:00:46.480> first

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:46.899 
didn't like at first

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:48.440 
didn't like at first
because<00:00:47.170> everything's<00:00:47.560> already<00:00:47.649> set<00:00:48.040> up<00:00:48.070> but

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
because everything's already set up but

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.030 
because everything's already set up but
once<00:00:49.450> the<00:00:49.720> new<00:00:49.870> survivors<00:00:50.410> story<00:00:50.739> kind<00:00:50.980> of

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.040 
once the new survivors story kind of

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.639 
once the new survivors story kind of
unravels<00:00:51.640> I<00:00:51.850> actually<00:00:52.660> like<00:00:52.960> the<00:00:53.110> idea<00:00:53.170> of<00:00:53.440> a

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:53.649 
unravels I actually like the idea of a

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:54.990 
unravels I actually like the idea of a
new<00:00:53.739> guide<00:00:53.920> for<00:00:54.160> the<00:00:54.220> game<00:00:54.399> not<00:00:54.670> for<00:00:54.790> the<00:00:54.850> show

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
new guide for the game not for the show

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.120 
new guide for the game not for the show
obviously<00:00:55.149> but<00:00:55.720> anyway<00:00:56.020> it's<00:00:56.860> kind<00:00:57.040> of

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:57.130 
obviously but anyway it's kind of

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.270 
obviously but anyway it's kind of
confusing<00:00:57.309> at<00:00:57.700> first<00:00:58.620> until<00:00:59.620> you<00:00:59.829> realize

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
confusing at first until you realize

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.740 
confusing at first until you realize
that<00:01:01.050> you<00:01:02.050> are<00:01:02.079> in<00:01:02.260> fact<00:01:03.100> a<00:01:03.489> guy<00:01:04.089> who<00:01:04.149> isn't<00:01:04.540> in

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
that you are in fact a guy who isn't in

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:05.249 
that you are in fact a guy who isn't in
the<00:01:04.839> show

00:01:05.249 --> 00:01:05.259 
the show

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:06.480 
the show
which<00:01:05.470> isn't<00:01:05.740> totally<00:01:05.979> clear<00:01:06.340> at<00:01:06.460> first

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
which isn't totally clear at first

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.160 
which isn't totally clear at first
because<00:01:06.910> they're<00:01:07.240> from<00:01:07.660> all<00:01:07.780> the<00:01:07.930> kind<00:01:08.110> of

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
because they're from all the kind of

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.980 
because they're from all the kind of
muddies<00:01:08.440> but<00:01:08.619> anyway<00:01:09.060> story<00:01:10.060> as<00:01:10.270> expected<00:01:10.660> is

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
muddies but anyway story as expected is

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.800 
muddies but anyway story as expected is
definitely<00:01:11.590> the<00:01:11.710> game<00:01:11.830> strong<00:01:12.190> point<00:01:12.810> your

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
definitely the game strong point your

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.330 
definitely the game strong point your
character<00:01:14.229> as<00:01:14.440> with<00:01:14.619> every<00:01:14.830> character<00:01:14.979> in<00:01:15.250> the

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
character as with every character in the

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.460 
character as with every character in the
actual<00:01:15.580> show<00:01:15.820> could<00:01:16.210> possibly<00:01:16.600> be<00:01:16.869> like<00:01:17.320> their

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
actual show could possibly be like their

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.680 
actual show could possibly be like their
own<00:01:17.619> miniseries<00:01:18.280> himself<00:01:18.729> just<00:01:19.180> uncover

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
own miniseries himself just uncover

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.039 
own miniseries himself just uncover
their<00:01:19.869> past<00:01:20.110> and<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:22.119> is<00:01:22.150> up<00:01:22.540> to<00:01:22.659> par<00:01:22.869> with<00:01:22.900> a

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
their past and it is up to par with a

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:25.170 
their past and it is up to par with a
lot<00:01:23.229> of<00:01:23.260> the<00:01:23.500> the<00:01:24.280> in<00:01:24.520> the<00:01:24.670> actual<00:01:24.970> show

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
lot of the the in the actual show

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.820 
lot of the the in the actual show
characters<00:01:25.630> past<00:01:25.840> so<00:01:26.200> you'll<00:01:26.710> have

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
characters past so you'll have

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.679 
characters past so you'll have
flashbacks<00:01:27.430> just<00:01:27.729> like<00:01:27.850> in<00:01:27.970> the<00:01:28.030> show<00:01:28.240> during

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:28.689 
flashbacks just like in the show during

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:29.820 
flashbacks just like in the show during
the<00:01:28.810> flashbacks<00:01:29.229> you'll<00:01:29.470> have<00:01:29.590> to<00:01:29.680> use<00:01:29.710> a

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
the flashbacks you'll have to use a

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.920 
the flashbacks you'll have to use a
camera<00:01:30.130> to<00:01:30.340> take<00:01:30.460> a<00:01:30.610> picture<00:01:30.880> at<00:01:31.540> the<00:01:31.750> right

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
camera to take a picture at the right

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.140 
camera to take a picture at the right
moment<00:01:32.439> to<00:01:32.920> trigger<00:01:33.220> your<00:01:33.460> blurry<00:01:33.760> memory

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
moment to trigger your blurry memory

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.850 
moment to trigger your blurry memory
into<00:01:34.479> a<00:01:34.510> full<00:01:34.780> memory<00:01:35.020> that's<00:01:35.409> basically<00:01:35.680> the

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
into a full memory that's basically the

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.800 
into a full memory that's basically the
cutscene<00:01:36.220> that's<00:01:37.000> like<00:01:37.119> a<00:01:37.180> flashback<00:01:37.420> in<00:01:37.750> the

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
cutscene that's like a flashback in the

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.899 
cutscene that's like a flashback in the
show<00:01:37.990> the<00:01:38.619> camera<00:01:38.950> I<00:01:39.220> know<00:01:39.280> it<00:01:39.490> sounds<00:01:39.729> kind<00:01:39.880> of

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
show the camera I know it sounds kind of

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:41.940 
show the camera I know it sounds kind of
out<00:01:40.060> of<00:01:40.090> context<00:01:40.659> but<00:01:40.840> it<00:01:40.930> won't<00:01:41.170> sound<00:01:41.619> out<00:01:41.830> of

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
out of context but it won't sound out of

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.620 
out of context but it won't sound out of
context<00:01:42.400> once<00:01:42.580> you've<00:01:42.729> played<00:01:43.000> the<00:01:43.119> game<00:01:43.150> and

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
need it that'd be dumb so Byron tore
