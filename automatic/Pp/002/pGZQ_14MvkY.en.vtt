the first process is the molding we use

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.650 
the first process is the molding we use
female<00:03:02.240> molds<00:03:02.690> and<00:03:02.780> as<00:03:02.900> you<00:03:03.020> can<00:03:03.140> see<00:03:04.660> the

female molds and as you can see the

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.450 
female molds and as you can see the

and the reason we use a pocket boom it's
because<00:04:18.989> it<00:04:19.110> keeps<00:04:19.260> people<00:04:19.620> off<00:04:19.830> the<00:04:20.040> deck<00:04:20.280> and

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
because it keeps people off the deck and

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.010 
because it keeps people off the deck and
even<00:04:20.880> sees<00:04:21.090> because<00:04:21.420> you<00:04:21.510> can<00:04:21.630> drop<00:04:21.840> your

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
fall right into the pocket boom and then

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:31.590 
fall right into the pocket boom and then
you<00:04:25.170> zip<00:04:25.410> it<00:04:25.530> up<00:04:25.590> and<00:04:25.710> you're<00:04:25.860> done
