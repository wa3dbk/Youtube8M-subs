00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.150
 brought him so well good but have tournament chick 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:11.730
 I manage to do it just like a breath 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.440
 disassembled now 84 jumped into firefox 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.210
 depot 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.910
 try but this and saw just over 100 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.230
 rub for 100 meters she runs so tired 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.050
 just how much 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.789
 as the preparation of the night is probably just 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.439
 reason for reflection because 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.560
 world cup on cannonade something 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.449
 choose one that's where but then i'm not even 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.550
 I know that Carmelite join them 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.540
 with everything in healing your injuries 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.070
 that is, I think that here service 33 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.210
 too heavy 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.700
 what does she count on and put and 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.879
 to fall or a block of glass everywhere 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.829
 Well, it's all number 4, although the settings 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.079
 or four that get into the baton 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.510
 short 4 just realizing this is ours 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.430
 of course hard and be on just a finger in 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.829
 Basically it all but you have a petunia 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.899
 a chance to hurt what you can not clean 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.989
 be easier to even win your 200 meters 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.730
 q for example what to fight for victory in 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.549
 Relay with Jamaica is also not so 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.010
 they just recently often 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.110
 im losing 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.630
 so here you can that prize 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.120
 place but you understand the prize 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.510
 and mania 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:20.390
 not April on him far and long for 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.710
 these people only win 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.830
 but nothing less bothers you 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.930
 read our money yes I really don't know 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.180
 how do they dance it all paid 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:34.410
 they are a little different system than 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:38.430
 we do not know whether there is such a battle for these 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:41.790
 prize who where when where to run well in 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:44.370
 anyway of course there is no get it well 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.850
 what a terrific hundred meters 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:49.950
 girls than answer 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:53.430
 strong half gatling just new 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:57.090
 form handsome all so bright i can 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:02:00.050
 straight fire to michael rogers place carter 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.050
 ryan were 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.759
 on tyson will of course there was 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:09.429
 run it is a completely different weather yes 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:11.739
 now there is a bit of a gift to practice 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.480
 here now would show our 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:17.680
 Of course, it was not lucky for him that he 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:20.849
 certainly well prepared to go into this 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:24.370
 he hit course the wind tunnel 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:31.360
 cold weather is certainly not lucky 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:35.769
 he doesnâ€™t sleep and color doesnâ€™t sponsor 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:38.230
 adidas moscow understand lying there here 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:39.750
 somehow did not work out I do not know the volume of the house 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.420
 I did not see him 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.700
 musin run maybe somewhere in 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.920
 next tournament some well and now 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:57.510
 look at justin he this year was 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:57.510
 very good I must say very reliable 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.780
 9th edition 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:11.140
 clicked on 990 one in peking 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:16.660
 but look how they became but win of course 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:20.980
 and 988 26 the view is even stronger and stronger channel 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:24.040
 but the closer the day is before it heats up 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.870
 I want division at walk Komi well 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.030
 modicum okay okay so how to run 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.220
 feel the speed however we 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:34.420
 can compare before red belly was also 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:36.940
 second new york for tyson yes and here 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.080
 also 2 that is, well , somewhere to warn 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.060
 lonely it seems to me that the level 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.890
 readiness new de tout equally good 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:47.319
 it would be interesting to see of course them 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:49.510
 together well tyson 986 with you remember with 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:52.400
 normal wind ran there 02 just something 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:55.220
 was therefore 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:59.870
 right here maria rogers rogers 2 were 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:02.349
 darnitsu so they all of course ran out 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:05.599
 out of 10 seconds let's see the time now 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:08.209
 rogers by the way ran 996 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:10.010
 In Beijing, we just our viewers 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.829
 announced them but the result of the winner 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:15.109
 michael there already looked like this is that tournament 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:17.539
 was three days after shanghai 

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:19.459
 Beijing and no one showed him but 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:21.829
 no less result and they announced to you and 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.840
 michael rogers was there too 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:25.280
 not bad we somehow got used yes to it 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.710
 mainly navigate in winter 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:31.310
 of small stature runs well 60 meters 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:33.889
 like a hundred never yes here at 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:36.380
 least these big guys did not win 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:41.620
 Us see right riddle on a paid 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:46.490
 well never mind the wind is not evening 8888 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:55.180
 the result will be stamped 94500 yes 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:55.180
 rogers killed 1000 and exactly sump 03 

00:04:56.689 --> 00:05:01.869
 the rest could have this wind 0 out of 300 

00:04:59.029 --> 00:05:04.219
 or the victim has sprained xfce 

00:05:01.869 --> 00:05:07.249
 let's look from this angle yet 

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:09.469
 but justin times in good condition 

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:11.869
 let's say through cool runs very 

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:13.759
 reliable i must say here and when not 

00:05:11.869 --> 00:05:15.919
 produces it by some very and 

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:18.129
 ease but that would be tighter but not 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:19.759
 less he runs from start to finish without 

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:22.939
 some failures 

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:25.759
 and the start is good and the ending he holds 

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:27.289
 the account of it is better yes very exactly cow 

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:30.429
 reliably all distance you about 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:30.429
 pushes pushes
