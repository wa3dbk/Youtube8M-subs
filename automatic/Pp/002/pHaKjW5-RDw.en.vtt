00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
used to seal these up but I guess they

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.950 
used to seal these up but I guess they
don't<00:01:40.409> do<00:01:40.650> that<00:01:40.829> anymore<00:01:41.040> so<00:01:41.520> all<00:01:42.420> right<00:01:42.570> also

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.630 
don't do that anymore so all right also
the<00:01:43.079> deck<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.470> not<00:01:43.649> in<00:01:43.829> order<00:01:43.950> so<00:01:44.399> if<00:01:44.520> that's

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
the deck is not in order so if that's

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.280
