worldwide watching this today and we

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.850 
worldwide watching this today and we
have<00:00:12.360> two<00:00:12.540> tropical<00:00:12.840> cyclones<00:00:13.500> down<00:00:13.650> in<00:00:13.769> the

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
have two tropical cyclones down in the

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.950 
have two tropical cyclones down in the
Southern<00:00:14.160> Pacific<00:00:14.280> right<00:00:14.759> now<00:00:14.910> we<00:00:14.969> have<00:00:15.269> Wilma

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
Southern Pacific right now we have Wilma

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.930 
Southern Pacific right now we have Wilma
just<00:00:16.230> off<00:00:16.379> screen<00:00:16.920> here<00:00:17.190> I'll<00:00:17.340> towards<00:00:17.789> the

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
just off screen here I'll towards the

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.160 
just off screen here I'll towards the
east<00:00:18.119> here<00:00:18.390> kind<00:00:18.660> of<00:00:18.720> seeing<00:00:18.869> some<00:00:19.020> of<00:00:19.109> the

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
east here kind of seeing some of the

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.050 
east here kind of seeing some of the
outflow<00:00:19.500> rate<00:00:19.650> on<00:00:19.800> here<00:00:20.070> and<00:00:20.340> also<00:00:20.670> we<00:00:20.939> have

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
outflow rate on here and also we have

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.370 
outflow rate on here and also we have
anthony<00:00:21.570> r<00:00:21.600> now<00:00:21.810> this<00:00:21.960> is<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.170> one<00:00:22.260> we're

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
anthony r now this is the one we're

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.689 
anthony r now this is the one we're
going<00:00:22.470> to<00:00:22.529> talk<00:00:22.710> about<00:00:22.859> in<00:00:23.039> this<00:00:23.160> update<00:00:23.369> rate

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
going to talk about in this update rate

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.370 
going to talk about in this update rate
in<00:00:23.820> here<00:00:24.029> because<00:00:24.300> it<00:00:24.449> is<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.689> closest<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.350> a

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
in here because it is the closest to a

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.380 
in here because it is the closest to a
large<00:00:25.650> population<00:00:25.890> right<00:00:26.519> now<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:26.939> it

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
large population right now and it

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.790 
large population right now and it
actually<00:00:27.539> looks<00:00:27.900> like<00:00:28.019> it's<00:00:28.199> going<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.680> be

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
actually looks like it's going to be

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.890 
actually looks like it's going to be
making<00:00:29.130> landfall<00:00:29.460> in<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:30.090> long<00:00:30.390> term<00:00:30.630> here

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
making landfall in the long term here

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.950 
making landfall in the long term here
very<00:00:31.109> potential<00:00:31.769> for<00:00:31.980> I<00:00:32.009> have<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.399> pretty

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
very potential for I have a pretty

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.389 
very potential for I have a pretty
significant<00:00:33.960> cyclone<00:00:34.440> making<00:00:34.710> landfall<00:00:34.920> here

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
significant cyclone making landfall here

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.100

tropical storm out here but the

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.980 
tropical storm out here but the
organization<00:01:33.119> is<00:01:33.270> there<00:01:33.570> for<00:01:33.780> further

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
organization is there for further

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.480 
organization is there for further
development<00:01:34.530> actually<00:01:34.650> showing<00:01:34.950> some<00:01:35.220> of<00:01:35.369> the

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
development actually showing some of the

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.190 
development actually showing some of the
microwave<00:01:35.970> imagery<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.540> here<00:01:36.689> you<00:01:36.810> can<00:01:37.020> see

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
microwave imagery and here you can see

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.840 
microwave imagery and here you can see
those<00:01:37.380> are<00:01:37.590> lower<00:01:37.799> bands<00:01:38.130> right<00:01:38.430> in<00:01:38.579> here

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
those are lower bands right in here

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.370 
those are lower bands right in here
showing<00:01:39.060> those<00:01:39.270> thunderstorm<00:01:39.840> clouds<00:01:40.170> right

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
showing those thunderstorm clouds right

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.289 
showing those thunderstorm clouds right
in<00:01:40.470> here<00:01:40.650> some<00:01:41.100> precipitation<00:01:41.549> air<00:01:42.030> showing

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
in here some precipitation air showing

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.730 
in here some precipitation air showing
the<00:01:42.390> higher<00:01:42.540> amount<00:01:42.899> of<00:01:42.990> precipitation<00:01:43.290> you

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
the higher amount of precipitation you

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.889 
the higher amount of precipitation you
can<00:01:43.950> see<00:01:44.159> that<00:01:44.189> overall<00:01:44.579> rotation<00:01:45.210> here<00:01:45.479> it's

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
can see that overall rotation here it's

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.840 
can see that overall rotation here it's
all<00:01:46.020> just<00:01:46.439> offshore<00:01:46.649> of<00:01:47.009> cans<00:01:47.310> right<00:01:47.520> in<00:01:47.670> here

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
where is this storm going to go and

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.930 
where is this storm going to go and
what's<00:02:25.680> going<00:02:25.860> to<00:02:25.920> happen<00:02:26.220> with<00:02:26.400> this<00:02:26.550> as<00:02:26.760> far

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
what's going to happen with this as far

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.120 
what's going to happen with this as far
as<00:02:27.060> it<00:02:27.180> making<00:02:27.450> landfall<00:02:27.630> on<00:02:27.900> cans<00:02:28.710> and<00:02:28.980> when's

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
as it making landfall on cans and when's

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.250 
as it making landfall on cans and when's
that<00:02:29.220> going<00:02:29.550> to<00:02:29.640> happen<00:02:29.790> well<00:02:30.150> this<00:02:30.960> is<00:02:31.080> just

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
that going to happen well this is just

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.770 
that going to happen well this is just
my<00:02:31.410> thoughts<00:02:31.710> on<00:02:32.010> it<00:02:32.040> I<00:02:32.430> took<00:02:32.490> a<00:02:33.090> combination

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
my thoughts on it I took a combination

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.150 
my thoughts on it I took a combination
of<00:02:33.840> several<00:02:34.050> models<00:02:34.530> also<00:02:34.770> looked<00:02:35.070> at

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
of several models also looked at

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.620 
of several models also looked at
streamline<00:02:35.610> analysis<00:02:36.150> and<00:02:36.300> kind<00:02:36.420> of<00:02:36.480> threw

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
streamline analysis and kind of threw

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.090 
streamline analysis and kind of threw
together<00:02:36.900> a<00:02:37.110> couple<00:02:37.320> charts<00:02:37.680> right<00:02:37.830> in<00:02:37.920> here

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
together a couple charts right in here

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.620 
together a couple charts right in here
well<00:02:38.250> right<00:02:38.700> now<00:02:38.730> we<00:02:38.910> do<00:02:39.090> have<00:02:39.270> this<00:02:39.450> are

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
well right now we do have this are

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.180 
well right now we do have this are
tropical<00:02:39.840> storm<00:02:40.320> reading<00:02:40.680> here<00:02:40.920> is<00:02:41.040> our

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
tropical storm reading here is our

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.090 
tropical storm reading here is our
tropical<00:02:41.430> cyclone<00:02:42.090> it's<00:02:42.300> engulfed<00:02:42.690> in<00:02:42.810> the

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
tropical cyclone it's engulfed in the

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.620 
tropical cyclone it's engulfed in the
monsoonal<00:02:44.100> trough<00:02:44.160> located<00:02:45.060> throughout<00:02:45.420> this

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
monsoonal trough located throughout this

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.570 
monsoonal trough located throughout this
area<00:02:45.870> rate<00:02:46.260> in<00:02:46.470> here<00:02:46.740> and<00:02:46.860> also<00:02:47.010> I'm<00:02:47.220> an<00:02:47.310> area

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
area rate in here and also I'm an area

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:48.920 
area rate in here and also I'm an area
of<00:02:47.610> high<00:02:47.670> pressure<00:02:47.760> farther<00:02:48.420> door<00:02:48.630> in<00:02:48.720> South

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
of high pressure farther door in South

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.720 
of high pressure farther door in South
here<00:02:49.140> now<00:02:49.320> typically<00:02:50.070> the<00:02:50.190> storm<00:02:50.460> is<00:02:50.550> going<00:02:50.670> to

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
here now typically the storm is going to

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.580 
here now typically the storm is going to
drift<00:02:50.940> off<00:02:51.150> towards<00:02:51.630> the<00:02:51.690> south<00:02:51.960> but<00:02:52.230> actually

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
drift off towards the south but actually

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.660 
drift off towards the south but actually
it<00:02:52.710> looks<00:02:52.860> like<00:02:52.980> is<00:02:53.040> going<00:02:53.070> to<00:02:53.250> track<00:02:53.430> back

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
it looks like is going to track back

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:54.950 
it looks like is going to track back
towards<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.090> west<00:02:54.270> and<00:02:54.510> that's<00:02:54.690> mainly

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
towards the west and that's mainly

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.660 
towards the west and that's mainly
because<00:02:55.080> as<00:02:55.440> it<00:02:55.470> begins<00:02:55.770> to<00:02:55.920> track<00:02:56.250> towards

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
because as it begins to track towards

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:57.770 
because as it begins to track towards
the<00:02:56.760> south<00:02:56.970> here<00:02:57.180> it's<00:02:57.300> actually<00:02:57.390> going<00:02:57.690> to

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
the south here it's actually going to

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.600 
the south here it's actually going to
bump<00:02:57.960> right<00:02:58.200> into<00:02:58.260> this<00:02:58.770> high<00:02:58.950> pressure<00:02:59.310> rate

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
bump right into this high pressure rate

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.610 
bump right into this high pressure rate
in<00:02:59.760> here<00:03:00.000> and<00:03:00.090> it<00:03:00.180> began<00:03:00.360> to<00:03:00.420> basically<00:03:01.200> can't

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
in here and it began to basically can't

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.260 
in here and it began to basically can't
go<00:03:01.740> back<00:03:01.950> towards<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.370> north<00:03:02.610> here<00:03:02.850> towards

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
go back towards the north here towards

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.270 
go back towards the north here towards
the<00:03:03.360> lowest<00:03:03.840> pressure<00:03:04.200> now<00:03:04.620> I<00:03:04.650> like<00:03:04.890> to<00:03:05.040> think

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
the lowest pressure now I like to think

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.750 
the lowest pressure now I like to think
of<00:03:05.490> tropical<00:03:06.450> cyclones<00:03:07.020> as<00:03:07.310> basically<00:03:08.310> water

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
of tropical cyclones as basically water

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.980 
of tropical cyclones as basically water
running<00:03:09.150> downhill<00:03:09.330> it's<00:03:09.600> never<00:03:09.780> going<00:03:09.900> to

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
running downhill it's never going to

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.240 
running downhill it's never going to
want<00:03:10.110> to<00:03:10.260> go<00:03:10.350> towards<00:03:10.680> this<00:03:10.770> area<00:03:10.980> of<00:03:11.130> high

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
want to go towards this area of high

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.290 
want to go towards this area of high
pressure<00:03:11.280> is<00:03:11.700> going<00:03:11.730> to<00:03:11.880> want<00:03:12.030> to<00:03:12.060> go<00:03:12.150> back

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
pressure is going to want to go back

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.270 
pressure is going to want to go back
towards<00:03:12.540> that<00:03:12.780> troughing<00:03:13.110> so<00:03:13.530> you're<00:03:14.160> going

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
towards that troughing so you're going

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.710 
towards that troughing so you're going
to<00:03:14.340> actually<00:03:14.490> see<00:03:14.790> a<00:03:14.820> southeasterly

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
to actually see a southeasterly

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:16.940 
to actually see a southeasterly
progression<00:03:16.290> that<00:03:16.380> it's<00:03:16.530> actually<00:03:16.650> going<00:03:16.860> to

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
progression that it's actually going to

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.290 
progression that it's actually going to
turn<00:03:17.190> around<00:03:17.280> and<00:03:17.580> head<00:03:17.700> back<00:03:17.760> towards<00:03:18.240> the

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
turn around and head back towards the

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.940 
turn around and head back towards the
north<00:03:18.540> and<00:03:18.690> eventually<00:03:19.140> back<00:03:19.320> towards<00:03:19.770> a

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
north and eventually back towards a

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.010 
north and eventually back towards a
Queensland<00:03:20.790> up<00:03:20.940> here<00:03:21.150> and<00:03:21.300> then<00:03:21.570> coming<00:03:21.840> out

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
Queensland up here and then coming out

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.590 
Queensland up here and then coming out
into<00:03:22.200> the<00:03:22.440> 25th<00:03:23.250> and<00:03:23.459> possibly<00:03:23.790> into<00:03:24.030> the<00:03:24.090> 26

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
into the 25th and possibly into the 26

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.060 
into the 25th and possibly into the 26
you're<00:03:24.750> going<00:03:24.870> to<00:03:24.930> actually<00:03:25.050> see<00:03:25.410> the<00:03:25.680> system

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
you're going to actually see the system

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.650 
you're going to actually see the system
develop<00:03:26.580> up<00:03:26.670> towards<00:03:26.970> cyclone<00:03:27.360> strength

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
develop up towards cyclone strength

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.930 
develop up towards cyclone strength
that's<00:03:27.840> why<00:03:27.959> it's<00:03:28.110> colored<00:03:28.380> in<00:03:28.620> now<00:03:28.940> basically

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
that's why it's colored in now basically

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.630 
that's why it's colored in now basically
due<00:03:30.360> to<00:03:30.540> even<00:03:30.959> more<00:03:31.170> Equatoria<00:03:31.890> outflow<00:03:32.340> up<00:03:32.490> in

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
due to even more Equatoria outflow up in

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.800 
due to even more Equatoria outflow up in

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
here wind shear is going to start to

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.150 
here wind shear is going to start to
subside<00:03:33.990> it's<00:03:34.440> still<00:03:34.650> going<00:03:34.770> to<00:03:34.860> have<00:03:34.980> this

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
subside it's still going to have this

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.400 
subside it's still going to have this

relatively<00:03:37.860> stationary<00:03:38.310> but<00:03:38.880> it's<00:03:39.360> going<00:03:39.570> to

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
relatively stationary but it's going to

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.690 
relatively stationary but it's going to
develop<00:03:39.959> even<00:03:40.350> strong<00:03:40.740> then<00:03:41.130> even<00:03:41.430> looking

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
develop even strong then even looking

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.510 
develop even strong then even looking

a large potential of change right now

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
precipitation extending out this is this

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.490 
precipitation extending out this is this
basically<00:04:15.090> cloud<00:04:15.420> band<00:04:15.750> showing<00:04:16.140> where<00:04:16.320> that

this month right now and also looking at

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.950 
this month right now and also looking at
winds<00:04:22.940> definitely<00:04:23.940> up<00:04:24.060> in<00:04:24.180> that<00:04:24.330> cyclone<00:04:24.900> or

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
winds definitely up in that cyclone or

65 gusting up to 70 knots and even
higher<00:04:29.789> at<00:04:30.090> times<00:04:30.300> it's<00:04:30.539> very<00:04:30.599> possible<00:04:30.960> but

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
higher at times it's very possible but

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.379 
higher at times it's very possible but
here<00:04:31.740> looking<00:04:32.009> at<00:04:32.099> JTWC<00:04:32.849> that's<00:04:33.030> a<00:04:33.120> Joint

Typhoon Warning Center out of Pearl

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:36.830 
Typhoon Warning Center out of Pearl
Harbor<00:04:35.520> and<00:04:35.550> showing<00:04:36.000> their<00:04:36.180> warning<00:04:36.569> on<00:04:36.690> it

Harbor and showing their warning on it

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.779 
Harbor and showing their warning on it
they<00:04:37.199> do<00:04:37.349> have<00:04:37.500> that<00:04:37.680> easterly<00:04:38.159> progression

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:38.789 
they do have that easterly progression

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:40.909 
they do have that easterly progression
on<00:04:38.879> the<00:04:38.970> 24th<00:04:39.389> 25th<00:04:39.750> by<00:04:40.349> the<00:04:40.409> time<00:04:40.620> it<00:04:40.710> starts

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
on the 24th 25th by the time it starts

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:42.920 
on the 24th 25th by the time it starts
to<00:04:40.979> bump<00:04:41.159> into<00:04:41.280> high<00:04:41.520> pressure<00:04:41.879> it'll<00:04:42.629> swing

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
to bump into high pressure it'll swing

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.020 
to bump into high pressure it'll swing
back<00:04:43.169> around<00:04:43.199> out<00:04:43.710> towards<00:04:44.099> the<00:04:44.250> west<00:04:44.520> here

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
back around out towards the west here

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.270 
back around out towards the west here
and<00:04:45.180> they<00:04:45.539> have<00:04:45.720> this<00:04:45.840> very<00:04:46.169> very<00:04:46.560> large<00:04:46.830> cone

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
and they have this very very large cone

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.740 
and they have this very very large cone
they're<00:04:47.580> pretty<00:04:47.849> confident<00:04:48.419> on<00:04:48.569> the

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
they're pretty confident on the

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.270 
they're pretty confident on the
turnaround<00:04:49.259> here<00:04:49.440> coming<00:04:49.770> back<00:04:49.889> towards<00:04:50.190> the

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
turnaround here coming back towards the

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.939 
turnaround here coming back towards the
west<00:04:50.400> but<00:04:50.669> the<00:04:50.759> cone<00:04:50.970> extends<00:04:51.419> all<00:04:51.599> the<00:04:51.659> way

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:51.949 
west but the cone extends all the way

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:54.680 
west but the cone extends all the way
just<00:04:52.949> north<00:04:53.220> of<00:04:53.400> the<00:04:53.550> Townsville<00:04:54.210> here<00:04:54.509> all

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
just north of the Townsville here all

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.300 
just north of the Townsville here all
the<00:04:54.810> way<00:04:54.840> out<00:04:54.900> towards<00:04:55.199> cans<00:04:55.680> and<00:04:55.860> even<00:04:56.190> out

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
the way out towards cans and even out

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:57.950 
the way out towards cans and even out
towards<00:04:56.610> Papua<00:04:56.909> New<00:04:56.940> Guinea<00:04:57.180> very<00:04:57.509> possible

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
towards Papua New Guinea very possible

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.869 
towards Papua New Guinea very possible
the<00:04:58.080> storm<00:04:58.319> makes<00:04:58.560> its<00:04:58.710> way<00:04:58.860> up<00:04:58.979> there<00:04:59.129> if<00:04:59.430> it

00:04:59.869 --> 00:04:59.879 
the storm makes its way up there if it

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:01.459 
the storm makes its way up there if it
does<00:05:00.090> go<00:05:00.300> eventually<00:05:00.629> go<00:05:00.930> back<00:05:00.960> to<00:05:01.229> this<00:05:01.289> way

00:05:01.459 --> 00:05:01.469 
does go eventually go back to this way

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:04.040 
does go eventually go back to this way
I've<00:05:01.710> really<00:05:02.430> not<00:05:02.580> seen<00:05:02.879> a<00:05:02.909> storm<00:05:03.210> go<00:05:03.569> towards

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
I've really not seen a storm go towards

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.570 
I've really not seen a storm go towards
the<00:05:04.110> equator<00:05:04.259> like<00:05:04.740> that<00:05:04.979> and<00:05:05.190> it's<00:05:05.400> not

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
the equator like that and it's not

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.959 
the equator like that and it's not
really<00:05:06.469> likely<00:05:07.469> but<00:05:08.069> if<00:05:08.310> it<00:05:08.460> does<00:05:08.699> it

00:05:08.959 --> 00:05:08.969 
really likely but if it does it

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:11.089 
really likely but if it does it
eventually<00:05:09.240> will<00:05:09.449> fizzle<00:05:10.080> out<00:05:10.199> due<00:05:10.590> to<00:05:10.620> lack

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:11.099 
eventually will fizzle out due to lack

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:12.980 
eventually will fizzle out due to lack
of<00:05:11.129> Coriolis<00:05:11.909> up<00:05:12.120> there<00:05:12.360> just<00:05:12.569> turn<00:05:12.750> into<00:05:12.960> a

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
of Coriolis up there just turn into a

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.230 
of Coriolis up there just turn into a
big<00:05:13.169> blob<00:05:13.440> of<00:05:13.469> convection<00:05:13.919> likely<00:05:14.430> but<00:05:14.669> rain

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
big blob of convection likely but rain

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.119 
big blob of convection likely but rain
now<00:05:15.449> from<00:05:16.080> what<00:05:16.199> I'm<00:05:16.379> seeing<00:05:16.409> where<00:05:17.039> the

00:05:17.119 --> 00:05:17.129 
now from what I'm seeing where the

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:18.409 
now from what I'm seeing where the
models<00:05:17.460> are<00:05:17.520> showing<00:05:17.580> it<00:05:17.969> with<00:05:18.090> the<00:05:18.180> stream

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
models are showing it with the stream

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:19.939 
models are showing it with the stream
lines<00:05:18.629> indicating<00:05:19.080> it<00:05:19.319> looks<00:05:19.560> like<00:05:19.770> it's

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:19.949 
lines indicating it looks like it's

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:21.409 
lines indicating it looks like it's

Queensland rate up in this area now I

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:25.459 
Queensland rate up in this area now I
really<00:05:24.120> do<00:05:24.300> want<00:05:24.509> to<00:05:24.569> note<00:05:24.629> that<00:05:24.750> the<00:05:25.169> bureau

really do want to note that the bureau

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:27.770 
really do want to note that the bureau
of<00:05:25.560> meteorology<00:05:25.949> out<00:05:26.490> of<00:05:26.610> australia<00:05:27.300> is<00:05:27.479> not

of meteorology out of australia is not
picking<00:05:28.169> up<00:05:28.229> on<00:05:28.409> this<00:05:28.560> just<00:05:28.740> yet<00:05:28.919> they

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
actually but they're only going out

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.779 
actually but they're only going out
about<00:05:30.509> 48<00:05:31.110> hours<00:05:31.289> right<00:05:31.710> now<00:05:31.889> this<00:05:32.130> is<00:05:32.310> 23rd

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:32.789 
about 48 hours right now this is 23rd

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:35.240 
about 48 hours right now this is 23rd
right<00:05:33.000> now<00:05:33.150> about<00:05:33.389> this<00:05:33.539> timer<00:05:33.810> in<00:05:34.080> here<00:05:34.409> so

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
right now about this timer in here so

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:36.620 
right now about this timer in here so
eventually<00:05:35.759> going<00:05:36.029> to<00:05:36.090> see<00:05:36.240> this<00:05:36.360> move<00:05:36.509> out

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
eventually going to see this move out

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.390 
eventually going to see this move out
towards<00:05:36.840> the<00:05:36.990> 25th<00:05:37.560> now<00:05:37.740> I'm<00:05:37.860> not<00:05:37.979> expecting

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
towards the 25th now I'm not expecting

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.159 
towards the 25th now I'm not expecting
that<00:05:38.430> swing<00:05:38.789> around<00:05:38.909> towards<00:05:39.449> the<00:05:39.539> 20<00:05:39.810> until

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:40.169 
that swing around towards the 20 until

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:42.350 
that swing around towards the 20 until
the<00:05:40.349> 25th<00:05:40.800> into<00:05:41.099> the<00:05:41.190> 26<00:05:41.789> where<00:05:42.000> it<00:05:42.090> will<00:05:42.180> start

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
the 25th into the 26 where it will start

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.300 
the 25th into the 26 where it will start
coming<00:05:42.599> back<00:05:42.630> towards<00:05:42.990> the<00:05:43.050> west<00:05:43.229> so<00:05:43.979> beer

amount of mere outage we being kind of a

00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:49.459 
amount of mere outage we being kind of a
conservative<00:05:47.009> at<00:05:47.400> this<00:05:47.580> time<00:05:47.849> but<00:05:48.120> we<00:05:49.080> look

into tonight into tomorrow to see if

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:53.629 
into tonight into tomorrow to see if
they're<00:05:52.199> going<00:05:52.289> to<00:05:52.380> start<00:05:52.620> making<00:05:52.889> that<00:05:53.099> swing

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:53.639 
they're going to start making that swing

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:55.939 
they're going to start making that swing
and<00:05:53.849> making<00:05:54.569> the<00:05:54.659> storm<00:05:54.900> eventually<00:05:55.529> tracking

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:55.949 
and making the storm eventually tracking

00:05:55.949 --> 00:05:57.619 
and making the storm eventually tracking
back<00:05:56.069> towards<00:05:56.430> the<00:05:56.550> west<00:05:56.699> here<00:05:56.969> now<00:05:57.150> I<00:05:57.180> do<00:05:57.300> want

00:05:57.619 --> 00:05:57.629 
back towards the west here now I do want

00:05:57.629 --> 00:05:59.480 
back towards the west here now I do want
to<00:05:57.779> note<00:05:57.810> that<00:05:57.990> they<00:05:58.319> do<00:05:58.379> have<00:05:58.620> a<00:05:58.680> slowdown<00:05:59.279> in

00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.490 
to note that they do have a slowdown in

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:00.619 
to note that they do have a slowdown in
the<00:05:59.520> storm<00:05:59.849> used<00:06:00.029> to<00:06:00.150> actually<00:06:00.389> see<00:06:00.539> the

00:06:00.619 --> 00:06:00.629 
the storm used to actually see the

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:01.820 
the storm used to actually see the
difference<00:06:00.960> from<00:06:01.080> the<00:06:01.139> twenty-third<00:06:01.650> and

difference from the twenty-third and
twenty-fourth<00:06:02.460> here<00:06:02.729> and<00:06:03.180> then<00:06:03.300> 24<00:06:03.870> into<00:06:04.139> the

00:06:04.459 --> 00:06:04.469 
twenty-fourth here and then 24 into the

twenty-fourth here and then 24 into the
25th<00:06:05.370> the<00:06:05.610> storm<00:06:06.479> really<00:06:07.199> starts<00:06:07.500> to<00:06:07.590> slow

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860 
25th the storm really starts to slow

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.430 
25th the storm really starts to slow
down<00:06:08.069> between<00:06:08.370> those<00:06:08.789> two<00:06:09.029> times<00:06:09.330> so<00:06:09.750> that

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:10.440 
down between those two times so that

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.499 
down between those two times so that
could<00:06:10.800> be<00:06:10.830> the<00:06:11.099> first<00:06:11.310> step<00:06:11.460> of<00:06:11.789> them<00:06:11.940> step<00:06:12.300> of

00:06:12.499 --> 00:06:12.509 
could be the first step of them step of

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:14.480 
could be the first step of them step of
them<00:06:12.659> actually<00:06:12.870> making<00:06:13.319> that<00:06:13.650> first<00:06:13.830> warning

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 
them actually making that first warning

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:15.890 
them actually making that first warning
where<00:06:14.639> the<00:06:14.759> storm<00:06:15.000> will<00:06:15.150> start<00:06:15.360> to<00:06:15.449> swing<00:06:15.690> back

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:15.900

strong coming from the south at this

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.820 
strong coming from the south at this

time now the wind flow going off towards
the<00:06:49.860> southeast<00:06:50.250> I'm<00:06:51.090> really<00:06:51.630> starting<00:06:51.990> to

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 
the southeast I'm really starting to

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.300 
the southeast I'm really starting to
break<00:06:52.200> down<00:06:52.260> it's<00:06:52.710> going<00:06:52.830> to<00:06:52.920> be<00:06:52.980> going<00:06:53.100> out

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:53.310 
break down it's going to be going out

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:54.620 
break down it's going to be going out
towards<00:06:53.490> the<00:06:53.670> north<00:06:53.940> and<00:06:54.090> if<00:06:54.180> we<00:06:54.270> even<00:06:54.420> go

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:54.630 
towards the north and if we even go

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:56.240 
towards the north and if we even go
farther<00:06:54.960> out<00:06:55.260> towards<00:06:55.740> the<00:06:55.830> actually<00:06:56.130> I'm

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:56.250 
farther out towards the actually I'm

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:58.160 
farther out towards the actually I'm
just<00:06:56.460> going<00:06:56.580> to<00:06:56.610> scroll<00:06:56.910> down<00:06:56.970> here<00:06:57.690> out

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:58.170 
just going to scroll down here out

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:01.550 
just going to scroll down here out
towards<00:06:58.800> the<00:06:59.270> 26<00:07:00.270> here<00:07:00.480> you<00:07:00.630> really<00:07:00.900> began<00:07:01.410> to

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:01.560 
towards the 26 here you really began to

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:02.840 
towards the 26 here you really began to
see<00:07:01.740> that<00:07:01.890> wind<00:07:02.130> flow<00:07:02.310> coming<00:07:02.550> from<00:07:02.730> the

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:02.850 
see that wind flow coming from the

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:04.520 
see that wind flow coming from the
southeast<00:07:03.240> the<00:07:03.510> overall<00:07:03.870> background<00:07:04.320> flow

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:04.530 
southeast the overall background flow

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:06.620 
southeast the overall background flow
and<00:07:04.770> this<00:07:05.430> is<00:07:05.610> what<00:07:05.790> I<00:07:05.820> believe<00:07:05.970> is<00:07:06.390> going<00:07:06.510> to

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:06.630 
and this is what I believe is going to

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:08.600 
and this is what I believe is going to
pick<00:07:06.810> this<00:07:06.840> storm<00:07:07.290> up<00:07:07.440> by<00:07:07.590> the<00:07:07.650> 26<00:07:08.190> into<00:07:08.520> the

pick this storm up by the 26 into the

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:10.790 
pick this storm up by the 26 into the
27th<00:07:09.330> and<00:07:09.570> eventually<00:07:10.170> move<00:07:10.350> it<00:07:10.470> out<00:07:10.560> towards

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:10.800 
27th and eventually move it out towards

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.130 
27th and eventually move it out towards
the<00:07:10.980> the<00:07:11.370> West<00:07:11.610> but<00:07:12.180> that<00:07:12.330> is<00:07:12.450> all<00:07:12.600> I<00:07:12.630> got<00:07:12.720> for
