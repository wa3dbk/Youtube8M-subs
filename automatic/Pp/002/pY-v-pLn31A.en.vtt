that<00:00:04.440> is<00:00:04.560> a<00:00:04.589> really<00:00:04.950> well-built<00:00:08.690> piece<00:00:09.690> of

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
that is a really well-built piece of

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.520 
that is a really well-built piece of
machinery<00:00:10.139> right<00:00:10.410> there

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:12.530 
machinery right there

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.450 
machinery right there
now<00:00:13.530> on<00:00:13.710> to<00:00:13.889> the

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:16.460 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.420 

throttles<00:00:17.270> here<00:00:17.890> I've<00:00:18.890> done<00:00:19.100> it<00:00:19.130> a

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:19.430 
throttles here I've done it a

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.600 
throttles here I've done it a
test-fitting<00:00:20.390> of<00:00:20.630> the<00:00:20.720> panel<00:00:21.110> here<00:00:21.610> it's

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:22.610 
test-fitting of the panel here it's

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.050 
test-fitting of the panel here it's
going<00:00:22.760> to<00:00:22.820> go<00:00:23.110> over<00:00:24.220> the<00:00:25.220> new<00:00:25.400> stage<00:00:25.700> six

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 
going to go over the new stage six

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.160 
going to go over the new stage six
throttle<00:00:28.060> and<00:00:29.060> this<00:00:29.390> is<00:00:29.540> just<00:00:29.780> to<00:00:29.930> show<00:00:30.140> people

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170 
throttle and this is just to show people

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:37.090 
throttle and this is just to show people
what<00:00:31.090> it<00:00:32.090> looks<00:00:32.330> like<00:00:34.989> how<00:00:35.989> much<00:00:36.140> work<00:00:36.770> has<00:00:36.920> got

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
what it looks like how much work has got

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.479 
what it looks like how much work has got
to<00:00:37.160> be<00:00:37.250> done<00:00:37.400> to<00:00:38.080> make<00:00:39.080> the<00:00:39.110> the<00:00:39.770> throttle<00:00:40.160> fit

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
to be done to make the the throttle fit

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:43.570 
to be done to make the the throttle fit
I<00:00:40.730> don't<00:00:41.660> need<00:00:42.080> to<00:00:42.200> start<00:00:42.500> her<00:00:42.590> button<00:00:42.890> and

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:43.580 
I don't need to start her button and

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.370 
I don't need to start her button and
that<00:00:44.270> is<00:00:44.300> that's<00:00:44.690> part<00:00:44.870> of<00:00:44.989> the<00:00:45.050> throttle

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:45.380 
that is that's part of the throttle

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.660 
that is that's part of the throttle
right<00:00:45.530> there<00:00:45.800> absolutely

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670

chrome piece I don't need to start a

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.470 
chrome piece I don't need to start a
button<00:00:49.309> because<00:00:49.580> the<00:00:49.699> starter<00:00:50.030> will<00:00:50.150> not<00:00:50.269> work

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480

on<00:00:50.750> this<00:00:51.379> big<00:00:51.620> engine<00:00:51.890> it's<00:00:52.010> gotta<00:00:52.160> be

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
on this big engine it's gotta be

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:02.890 
next in the quest to make the throttle
fit<00:01:00.589> and<00:01:00.860> you<00:01:01.760> can<00:01:01.909> see<00:01:02.120> the<00:01:02.330> throttle<00:01:02.720> line

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:02.900 
fit and you can see the throttle line

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.550 
fit and you can see the throttle line
right<00:01:03.320> here<00:01:03.620> goes<00:01:04.489> down<00:01:04.930> it's<00:01:05.930> the<00:01:06.350> right

and<00:01:42.880> take<00:01:43.880> you<00:01:44.030> out<00:01:44.090> just<00:01:45.580> a<00:01:46.580> little<00:01:46.610> bit<00:01:46.850> right

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
and take you out just a little bit right

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.520 
and take you out just a little bit right
along<00:01:47.330> here<00:01:47.570> I<00:01:47.600> want<00:01:47.900> to<00:01:47.930> make<00:01:48.050> it<00:01:48.200> look<00:01:48.350> as

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
along here I want to make it look as

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.340 
along here I want to make it look as
stock<00:01:48.800> as<00:01:49.040> possible<00:01:49.640> and<00:01:49.910> not<00:01:50.870> have<00:01:51.080> it<00:01:51.110> look

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
stock as possible and not have it look

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.750 
stock as possible and not have it look
all<00:01:51.470> butchered<00:01:51.860> up<00:01:51.980> or<00:01:52.220> anything

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:52.760 
all butchered up or anything

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.750 
all butchered up or anything
so<00:01:53.570> if<00:01:54.020> I<00:01:54.200> took<00:01:54.260> out<00:01:54.590> just<00:01:54.830> a<00:01:54.950> little<00:01:54.980> bit<00:01:55.310> here

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:55.760 
so if I took out just a little bit here

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.530 
so if I took out just a little bit here
along<00:01:56.270> here<00:01:56.300> and<00:01:56.780> this<00:01:57.410> bottom<00:01:57.770> edge<00:01:58.030> then<00:01:59.030> I

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
along here and this bottom edge then I

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.750 
along here and this bottom edge then I
think<00:02:00.320> I<00:02:00.470> can<00:02:00.650> get<00:02:00.830> to<00:02:00.980> fit<00:02:01.190> better<00:02:01.370> and<00:02:01.490> what

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
think I can get to fit better and what

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:08.469 
think I can get to fit better and what
I'll<00:02:01.880> do<00:02:02.030> is<00:02:02.150> I'll<00:02:02.300> slowly<00:02:05.530> do<00:02:06.530> that

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
I'll do is I'll slowly do that

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.680 
I'll do is I'll slowly do that
you<00:02:09.050> know<00:02:09.170> using<00:02:09.619> a<00:02:10.009> metal<00:02:10.489> car<00:02:10.610> might<00:02:10.819> get<00:02:11.090> bit

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
you know using a metal car might get bit

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.660 
you know using a metal car might get bit
on<00:02:13.060> that<00:02:14.590> and<00:02:15.590> I<00:02:15.680> want<00:02:15.799> to<00:02:15.920> show<00:02:16.040> you<00:02:16.099> I'm<00:02:16.459> gonna

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
have switched hands here to show you how

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.630 
have switched hands here to show you how
well<00:02:19.489> the<00:02:19.610> throttle<00:02:20.000> works<00:02:20.560> on<00:02:21.560> this<00:02:21.890> this<00:02:22.459> is

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
well the throttle works on this this is

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.330 
well the throttle works on this this is
set<00:02:22.909> in<00:02:23.090> the<00:02:23.239> middle<00:02:23.269> point<00:02:24.069> and<00:02:25.069> the<00:02:25.190> one

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
set in the middle point and the one

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.949 
set in the middle point and the one
thing<00:02:25.519> I<00:02:25.670> really<00:02:25.910> like<00:02:26.060> about<00:02:26.090> this<00:02:26.450> throttle

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
thing I really like about this throttle

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:33.910 
thing I really like about this throttle
is<00:02:27.280> that<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:30.459> it<00:02:31.459> fits<00:02:31.849> right<00:02:32.150> up<00:02:32.299> against<00:02:32.920> the

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
is that the it fits right up against the

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:37.820 

these<00:04:35.960> throttles<00:04:36.960> which<00:04:37.110> these<00:04:37.319> are<00:04:37.379> stick

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
these throttles which these are stick

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.879 
these throttles which these are stick
our<00:04:37.979> grips<00:04:38.580> these<00:04:38.789> are<00:04:38.940> extended<00:04:39.330> an<00:04:39.419> inch

our grips these are extended an inch
this<00:04:40.889> will<00:04:41.190> be<00:04:41.310> this<00:04:42.270> throttle<00:04:43.199> right<00:04:43.620> here

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
this will be this throttle right here

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.189 
this will be this throttle right here
will<00:04:44.099> be<00:04:44.220> about<00:04:44.400> three<00:04:45.180> quarters<00:04:45.569> or<00:04:45.599> seven<00:04:46.080> or

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:46.199 
will be about three quarters or seven or

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:48.980 
will be about three quarters or seven or
eight<00:04:46.289> millimeters<00:04:47.099> longer<00:04:47.699> on<00:04:47.879> this<00:04:48.780> side

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
eight millimeters longer on this side

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:55.040 
eight millimeters longer on this side
this<00:04:49.560> way<00:04:53.240> so<00:04:54.240> I'm<00:04:54.360> going<00:04:54.539> to<00:04:54.599> break<00:04:54.780> out<00:04:54.870> my

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
this way so I'm going to break out my

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.309 
this way so I'm going to break out my
drum<00:04:55.289> Owen<00:04:56.300> see<00:04:57.300> if<00:04:57.389> we<00:04:57.509> can<00:04:57.659> get<00:04:57.810> this<00:04:57.960> to<00:04:58.110> fit

00:04:58.309 --> 00:04:58.319 
drum Owen see if we can get this to fit

00:04:58.319 --> 00:04:59.809 
drum Owen see if we can get this to fit
I<00:04:58.560> think<00:04:58.590> it's<00:04:58.919> gonna<00:04:59.069> fit<00:04:59.250> and<00:04:59.430> really<00:04:59.580> work

00:04:59.809 --> 00:04:59.819 
I think it's gonna fit and really work

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:03.619
