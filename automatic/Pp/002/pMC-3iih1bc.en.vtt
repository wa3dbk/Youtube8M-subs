00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 hold together how do you look like 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.400
 just like me extremely fast 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.410
 storage media in your computer 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.870
 if so, then you certainly use 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.340
 Such a commercial ssd like 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.900
 actually almost never come to light 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.370
 if it goes of course still far 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.670
 faster and with such a 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.199
 so-called ampunkt two ssd everything 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.330
 her to the point two ssd technology 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.130
 there must be in today 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:29.869
 combination with a review on samsung 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.869
 xp 941 am point two ssd let's go 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.170
 point two also known as next 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.510
 generation form factor denotes today 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.470
 extremely fast storage media such as 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.390
 for example, this xp 941 ssd 11.2 is true 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.460
 also as successor of sata or also 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.930
 mini sata and is represented for the first time 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.740
 since the introduction of interest 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.290
 refresh platform for example on 697 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:00.390
 97 and later on the x79 platform 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.580
 but why the whole thing has been there since 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.290
 a felt eternity present and 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.020
 After three generations, the limit is 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.330
 the sata technology reaches to sat 1 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.460
 followed 2 and 3, the latter then a 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.369
 data rate of six gigabits per second 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.470
 that's 7 in theory 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.360
 only 50 megabytes per second being 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.440
 the practice also clearly shows 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:25.229
 even with this pro ssd is at 550 5 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.610
 160 megabyte per second circuit-down 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.860
 it does not even do that at all 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.369
 fastest sata ssd on the planet too 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.200
 to buy 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.900
 because that is still benevolent 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.729
 expressed in modern pcs is easy 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.710
 the shitty sata 6 gb s 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.509
 interface a fucking bottles 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.119
 has such a crap but now I have 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.759
 such a fast ssd so and what new now 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.560
 at the endpoint two ssd first of all 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.390
 the connection will be over a special one 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.820
 interface makes it possible 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.770
 currently distinguished between b &amp; m k 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.360
 Household appliances only support one 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.429
 This pillow from the two modules with 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.979
 recesses in the positions b &amp; m 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:01.350
 use a maximum of two pci express lanes 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.270
 while endpoint 2 come only for gm 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.640
 suitable are up to four pci express 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.729
 Lanes use as synonymous samsung 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.970
 xp 941 the case is then there is still 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:17.010
 the form factor such as endpoint 2 22 42 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:19.500
 22 60 or even 22 80 the 22 stands for 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.480
 The connection width of 22 mm and 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.490
 for example, the 80 for a length of 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.290
 ssd of 80 millimeters based on the 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.970
 you can already have a form factor 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.240
 even the maximum possible bandwidth 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.100
 make out during endpoint 222 80 over 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.630
 the pci express protocol tethered 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.450
 I'll get to the logs soon 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:39.720
 again the others are ampunkt 2 22 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.680
 42 and 22 60 ssds only about the 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.420
 sata protocol 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.489
 tied up to here, yes, no 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.469
 the problem lies in the detail 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.239
 what a detail and that in the 

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:50.010
 protocol there is once the sata 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.840
 protocol and the already mentioned 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.090
 previously express protocol 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.549
 The pci express products was so far only 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.250
 at enterprise ssd to find the direct 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:02.549
 about pci express a good choice around that 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.530
 annoying sata 64 bit interface to work around 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:06.060
 an endpoint two ssd with sata 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.280
 protocol is then basically nothing 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.680
 other than a commercial ssd and 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.790
 This is the advantage of a point 2 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.250
 is it opposite one 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.810
 commercial ssd equal to zero and that 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.400
 You should definitely keep that in mind 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.299
 keep even if the prices are relative 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.010
 are identical 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:22.319
 the advantage is actually equal to only 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.049
 and that is point 2 with sata 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.980
 protocol absolutely uninteresting 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:28.400
 So interesting are actually only 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.319
 the ampunkt two ssds with pci-express 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.959
 protocol here an example one 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:37.439
 samsung 850 pro is about sata 6 gigabit 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:39.989
 offered per second like samsung xp 941 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:42.450
 is offered via pci express 2.0 x4 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:43.349
 So with a bandwidth of 16 megabits 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.900
 per second 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:47.729
 the ampunkt two ssd is almost with 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.310
 the triple bandwidth offered 

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:52.709
 compared to the sata ssd means more 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.629
 Bandwidth equal to higher performance 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.919
 cool to pci express protocol is the 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:58.290
 scalability for even higher 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:04:01.500
 Bandwidths such as pci express 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:04.139
 3.0 x4 the result then one 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.180
 incredible bandwidth of 32 gigabit 

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:08.519
 per second and that's pretty much 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.620
 fast and also pretty cool 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:12.090
 installing a ampunkt two ssd is 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.609
 so simple that one again 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.470
 the ssd is almost too simple 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:18.000
 obliquely inserts purely in the slot 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.340
 slide and then by means of 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.560
 screw fix so much 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.840
 first to point 2 technology and now 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:28.830
 Let's take a look at this point for the first time 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:32.130
 two samsung xp 941 ssb on 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:37.159
 Let's go xp 941 is optional 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:38.789
 with 128 over 256 up to 512 gigabytes 

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:42.240
 regardless of the memory size 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:44.400
 the samsung xp 941 uses the pci 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.770
 Express protocol with a maximum 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.690
 bandwidth of 16 gigabits per second 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.639
 both of which is called mlc memory as well 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.880
 the ex controller come from samsung 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:54.530
 the cash amounts to 2 0 65 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.870
 megabyte and otherwise there are five 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.340
 years warranty that was the theory after all 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.170
 as it looks in practice that 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.580
 Of course, we'll take a look now 

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:03.440
 First of all, it shows that mine 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.910
 chosen sport only over a 10 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.500
 gigabit per second interface 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.900
 Of course that still is 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:11.210
 more than 64 bit per second but always 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.440
 even less than the possible 16 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.990
 gigabit per second 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.960
 The result is 830 megabytes 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:19.670
 per second reading and 464 megabytes 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.230
 per second in writing the fact 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:22.850
 that my mainboard only has one 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:24.890
 10 gigabits per second interface 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:25.880
 of course I was from the beginning 

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:27.890
 been aware 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.870
 That's why I sometimes fix it completely 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:32.210
 This adapter card worried with the it 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.490
 possible is the up two ssd over the 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:36.020
 to operate regular pci express slot 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.360
 and the result is and here I am 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:41.110
 not otherwise expected full 16 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:43.750
 gigabit per second or in other words 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:46.550
 1055 megabytes per second reading and 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:48.500
 450 megabits per second in writing 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:50.690
 striking here is the relative 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.400
 low writing rate measured on the 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:54.950
 Leseratte but here again meets 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:57.560
 a classic ssd principle in power what 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:59.840
 it was already at sata and yes 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.330
 now synonymous with the point 2 and indeed 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:05.720
 this law states that smaller ssds 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:07.820
 So with smaller memory 128 gb to 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.480
 example about a lower writing rate 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.120
 feature 

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.320
 of course there are the 256 gb of 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.410
 and then offers one 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:17.450
 write rate of up to 850 megabytes per 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:18.680
 second and that's it again 

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:20.660
 pretty cool 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:25.070
 the biggest negative is simple 

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:26.600
 the price 128 gigabytes cost 110 euro 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:29.030
 That's measured by the performance 

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.620
 Okay, okay, I'm not saying that now 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:33.170
 SGS or phenomenal 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:35.720
 but of course it's okay one 

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:37.760
 commercial ampunkt two sata 6 gbit 

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:39.170
 per second connected ssd costs 

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:42.110
 as much as an example 

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:44.210
 Location ssd brand does not matter 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:46.160
 but basically one such ssd 

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:48.140
 completely useless since they are the same 

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:50.540
 performance offers like a normal sata 

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:52.280
 ssd and definitely you should 

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:54.260
 keep an update worthwhile 

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:57.230
 itself from a normal disk 

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:59.930
 an endpoint two ssd of course absolutely 

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:03.500
 if you have that on an update from eynatten 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:04.440
 samsung 48 58 years can become an in 

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:06.480
 point 2 

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:09.000
 tailed ssd about it can be 

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:10.680
 known fight but now it was 

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.210
 have been with the whole strap here 

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:14.340
 and that's why I'm interested now 

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:16.620
 your opinion to endpoint two ssd 

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:18.720
 Technology in combination with this 

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:22.830
 review on this review on this 

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:25.200
 review on samsung xp 941 two point 

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:26.850
 ssd liked it then thumb after 

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.590
 above and see you next 

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:31.400
 video again that is already in the 

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:35.660
 start and then until recently 

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:38.690
 such an endpoint two ssd motto 

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:41.350
 adapter of this express module card 

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:41.350
 concerned
