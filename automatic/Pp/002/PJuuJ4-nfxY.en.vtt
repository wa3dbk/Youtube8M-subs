00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.470 

I<00:00:00.890> think<00:00:01.890> it<00:00:01.979> really<00:00:02.070> depends<00:00:02.490> on<00:00:02.730> the<00:00:03.149> table

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
I think it really depends on the table

raises with from the big blind also if

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.720 
raises with from the big blind also if
you're<00:00:58.050> for<00:00:58.500> instance<00:00:58.559> in<00:00:58.890> my<00:00:59.160> heads-up<00:00:59.489> if

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
you're for instance in my heads-up if

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.880 
you're for instance in my heads-up if
you<00:00:59.820> recall<00:01:00.030> there<00:01:00.180> was<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.300> hand<00:01:00.570> where<00:01:00.899> um<00:01:01.140> my

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
you recall there was a hand where um my

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.429 
you recall there was a hand where um my
opponent<00:01:02.579> calls<00:01:02.969> with<00:01:03.210> 3/8<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:03.899> diamonds<00:01:04.379> I

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
opponent calls with 3/8 of diamonds I

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.960 
opponent calls with 3/8 of diamonds I
think<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.739> was<00:01:04.860> from<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.220> button<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.640> he

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
think it was from the button and he

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.370 
think it was from the button and he
should<00:01:06.119> have<00:01:06.210> raised<00:01:06.420> there<00:01:06.659> here's<00:01:06.930> why<00:01:07.110> if

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
should have raised there here's why if

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.630 
should have raised there here's why if
you're<00:01:07.560> not<00:01:07.710> going<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:07.890> fold<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.280> hand<00:01:08.460> and

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
you're not going to fold the hand and

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.789 
you're not going to fold the hand and
it's<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.150> bad<00:01:09.390> hand<00:01:09.630> like<00:01:09.840> 3/8<00:01:10.200> from<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.560> button

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
it's a bad hand like 3/8 from the button

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.500 
it's a bad hand like 3/8 from the button
he's<00:01:11.220> probably<00:01:11.430> calling<00:01:11.670> because<00:01:12.000> he<00:01:12.150> knows

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
he's probably calling because he knows

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.630 
he's probably calling because he knows
that<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:13.200> button<00:01:13.439> is<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.560> huge<00:01:13.770> advantage<00:01:14.100> the

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
that the button is a huge advantage the

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.980 
that the button is a huge advantage the
thing<00:01:14.790> is<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:14.970> want<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.180> give<00:01:15.450> me<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.600> chance<00:01:15.869> to

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
thing is you want to give me a chance to

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.020 
thing is you want to give me a chance to
fold<00:01:16.320> preflop<00:01:16.890> if<00:01:17.159> he<00:01:17.490> had<00:01:17.580> just<00:01:17.610> raised

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
fold preflop if he had just raised

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.749 
fold preflop if he had just raised
preflop<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:18.659> would<00:01:18.840> have<00:01:18.930> folded<00:01:19.080> my<00:01:19.350> 95<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:20.130> he

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
preflop I would have folded my 95 and he

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.010 
preflop I would have folded my 95 and he
would<00:01:20.880> have<00:01:20.970> won<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.210> hand<00:01:21.390> instead<00:01:21.750> he<00:01:21.840> gives

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
would have won the hand instead he gives

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 
because it's easier you know like either

I'm in or I'm out but calling that's a

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.090 
I'm in or I'm out but calling that's a
little<00:05:24.110> trickier<00:05:24.530> and<00:05:24.710> it's<00:05:24.800> a<00:05:24.830> little<00:05:24.979> more

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:25.100 
little trickier and it's a little more

into<00:05:25.430> you<00:05:25.789> know<00:05:25.910> high<00:05:26.479> end<00:05:26.720> so<00:05:27.050> that's<00:05:27.260> what<00:05:27.440> I

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:27.470 
into you know high end so that's what I

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.850

from you know being physically fit is
your<00:05:38.530> mental<00:05:38.830> state<00:05:39.130> so<00:05:39.820> I<00:05:39.850> spend<00:05:40.210> a<00:05:40.270> lot<00:05:40.300> of

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:40.450 
your mental state so I spend a lot of

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:41.970 
your mental state so I spend a lot of
time<00:05:40.660> and<00:05:40.840> energy<00:05:41.200> on<00:05:41.230> emotional

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:41.980 
time and energy on emotional

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:43.950 
time and energy on emotional
intelligence<00:05:42.190> on<00:05:42.670> making<00:05:42.970> sure<00:05:43.000> that<00:05:43.210> I'm

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 
intelligence on making sure that I'm

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.080 
intelligence on making sure that I'm
clear<00:05:44.650> on<00:05:44.770> what<00:05:44.920> I<00:05:44.950> want<00:05:45.220> to<00:05:45.280> do<00:05:45.400> my<00:05:45.640> intention

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
clear on what I want to do my intention

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:47.610 
clear on what I want to do my intention
is<00:05:46.180> clear<00:05:46.270> when<00:05:46.540> I<00:05:46.600> sit<00:05:46.810> down<00:05:46.930> on<00:05:46.990> the<00:05:47.170> table<00:05:47.500> my

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:47.620 
is clear when I sit down on the table my

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.310 
is clear when I sit down on the table my
intention<00:05:47.950> is<00:05:48.040> to<00:05:48.070> win<00:05:48.340> all<00:05:48.640> my<00:05:49.060> actions<00:05:49.570> must

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320 
intention is to win all my actions must

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.050 
intention is to win all my actions must
lead<00:05:50.650> towards<00:05:51.040> that<00:05:51.280> and<00:05:51.550> if<00:05:51.610> there<00:05:51.760> don't

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:52.060 
lead towards that and if there don't

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.520 
lead towards that and if there don't
then<00:05:52.390> that<00:05:52.420> means<00:05:52.930> I'm<00:05:53.050> probably<00:05:53.230> not<00:05:53.410> going

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:53.530 
then that means I'm probably not going

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:54.840 
then that means I'm probably not going
to<00:05:53.590> win<00:05:53.710> and<00:05:53.950> it<00:05:54.190> really<00:05:54.340> comes<00:05:54.550> also<00:05:54.730> from

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:54.850 
to win and it really comes also from

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:56.910 
to win and it really comes also from
belief<00:05:55.270> like<00:05:55.750> actually<00:05:56.230> believing<00:05:56.560> that<00:05:56.830> you

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:56.920 
belief like actually believing that you

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.530 
belief like actually believing that you
will<00:05:57.160> win<00:05:57.400> that's<00:05:57.730> super<00:05:58.120> important<00:05:58.450> in

00:05:58.530 --> 00:05:58.540 
will win that's super important in

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.560 
will win that's super important in
whatever<00:05:58.750> it<00:05:58.960> is<00:05:59.050> you<00:05:59.170> do<00:05:59.320> I<00:06:00.240> really<00:06:01.240> equally

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:01.570 
whatever it is you do I really equally

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:04.230 
whatever it is you do I really equally
on<00:06:01.660> math<00:06:01.870> and<00:06:01.900> instincts<00:06:02.800> my<00:06:03.760> decisions<00:06:04.150> of

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.240 
on math and instincts my decisions of

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.480 
on math and instincts my decisions of
course<00:06:04.450> will<00:06:04.840> seem<00:06:05.170> very<00:06:05.350> mathematical<00:06:05.980> but

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:06.490 
course will seem very mathematical but

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:08.460 
course will seem very mathematical but
if<00:06:06.850> you<00:06:07.090> watch<00:06:07.420> me<00:06:07.570> play<00:06:07.690> you<00:06:07.780> see<00:06:08.080> how<00:06:08.200> much<00:06:08.320> I

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:08.470 
if you watch me play you see how much I

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.320 
if you watch me play you see how much I
rely<00:06:08.860> on<00:06:08.890> my<00:06:08.980> physical<00:06:09.370> reads<00:06:09.550> of<00:06:09.700> people<00:06:10.000> and

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:10.330 
rely on my physical reads of people and

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.840 
rely on my physical reads of people and
a<00:06:10.750> lot<00:06:10.780> of<00:06:11.020> that<00:06:11.200> is<00:06:11.320> instinct<00:06:11.710> pace<00:06:11.890> so<00:06:12.820> I

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:12.850 
a lot of that is instinct pace so I

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:14.700 
a lot of that is instinct pace so I
would<00:06:13.270> say<00:06:13.390> that<00:06:13.420> those<00:06:13.990> two<00:06:14.200> factors<00:06:14.530> really

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:14.710 
would say that those two factors really

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:17.000 
would say that those two factors really
come<00:06:14.980> to<00:06:15.100> play<00:06:15.250> equally<00:06:15.550> for<00:06:15.730> me

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.010 
come to play equally for me

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:19.380 
come to play equally for me
there's<00:06:18.010> a<00:06:18.100> couple<00:06:18.280> of<00:06:18.520> ones<00:06:18.730> but<00:06:19.000> that's<00:06:19.240> the

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:19.390 
there's a couple of ones but that's the

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:21.270 
there's a couple of ones but that's the
one<00:06:19.540> I<00:06:19.600> have<00:06:19.780> in<00:06:19.930> mind<00:06:20.170> would<00:06:20.320> be<00:06:20.530> people<00:06:20.980> and
