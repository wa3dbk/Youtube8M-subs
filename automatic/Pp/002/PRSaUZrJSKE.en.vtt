starting<00:00:04.410> with<00:00:04.500> a<00:00:04.560> rectangle<00:00:05.130> fold<00:00:05.460> up<00:00:05.580> and

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
starting with a rectangle fold up and

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:12.220 
starting with a rectangle fold up and
half<00:00:05.879> long<00:00:06.089> ways<00:00:08.690> and<00:00:09.690> fold<00:00:10.139> in<00:00:10.260> half<00:00:10.440> again

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:12.230 
half long ways and fold in half again

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.369 
half long ways and fold in half again
open<00:00:13.230> it<00:00:13.320> up<00:00:13.410> and<00:00:14.540> fold<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.690> right<00:00:15.839> corner<00:00:16.230> to

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
open it up and fold the right corner to

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:28.150 
open it up and fold the right corner to
this<00:00:16.500> crease<00:00:20.000> then<00:00:21.000> fill<00:00:21.359> up<00:00:21.600> on<00:00:21.869> this<00:00:22.020> point

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:35.959 

then<00:00:29.160> fold<00:00:29.460> up<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:29.910> that<00:00:30.060> line<00:00:34.610> now<00:00:35.610> you<00:00:35.670> fold

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
then fold up to that line now you fold

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:42.229 
then fold up to that line now you fold
the<00:00:36.120> sides<00:00:36.300> in<00:00:36.540> for<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.809> center<00:00:40.850> fold<00:00:41.850> up<00:00:42.059> on

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
the sides in for the center fold up on

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.680 
the sides in for the center fold up on
that<00:00:42.360> line<00:00:43.640> then<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:44.850> fall<00:00:45.030> from<00:00:45.210> this<00:00:45.420> corner

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
that line then you fall from this corner

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.360 
that line then you fall from this corner
to<00:00:45.809> this<00:00:45.930> corner<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.620> this<00:00:46.920> corner<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.250> this

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
to this corner and this corner to this

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.090 
to this corner and this corner to this
corner<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.969> make<00:00:48.090> an<00:00:48.239> X<00:00:48.710> so<00:00:49.710> you<00:00:49.770> fall<00:00:49.980> from

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
corner to make an X so you fall from

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.779 
corner to make an X so you fall from
bottom<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.550> top<00:00:51.920> so<00:00:52.920> don't<00:00:53.160> fold<00:00:53.370> like<00:00:53.550> that

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
bottom to top so don't fold like that

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:54.830 
bottom to top so don't fold like that
because<00:00:53.910> then<00:00:54.149> you'll<00:00:54.270> be<00:00:54.300> creasing<00:00:54.750> the

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
because then you'll be creasing the

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.450 
because then you'll be creasing the
bottom<00:00:55.079> layer<00:00:55.230> so<00:00:55.770> you're<00:00:55.920> just<00:00:56.039> creasing

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
bottom layer so you're just creasing

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:09.410 
bottom layer so you're just creasing
this<00:00:56.760> layer<00:01:04.549> then<00:01:05.549> you<00:01:05.700> unfold<00:01:07.700> and<00:01:08.700> you

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
this layer then you unfold and you

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:17.120 
this layer then you unfold and you
extend<00:01:09.689> these<00:01:09.990> diagonal<00:01:10.560> lines<00:01:15.950> then<00:01:16.950> you

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
extend these diagonal lines then you

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.899 
extend these diagonal lines then you
fold<00:01:17.340> this<00:01:17.580> in<00:01:17.850> stop<00:01:18.540> at<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.840> center<00:01:19.640> fold<00:01:20.640> on

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
fold this in stop at the center fold on

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.820 
fold this in stop at the center fold on
the<00:01:20.939> center<00:01:21.390> line<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:22.350> there<00:01:22.560> should<00:01:22.740> be

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
the center line and there should be

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.679 
the center line and there should be
another<00:01:23.040> crease<00:01:23.340> here<00:01:23.549> which<00:01:24.150> matches<00:01:24.540> up

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
another crease here which matches up

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.170 
another crease here which matches up
with<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.960> star<00:01:25.200> goal<00:01:25.409> line<00:01:25.850> fold<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:27.030> down

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.190 

and<00:01:30.180> then<00:01:30.390> fold<00:01:30.689> at<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:30.930> center<00:01:31.350> line<00:01:31.500> again

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
and then fold at the center line again

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.270 
and then fold at the center line again
there<00:01:34.200> should<00:01:34.350> also<00:01:34.439> be<00:01:34.650> another<00:01:35.009> diagonal

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
there should also be another diagonal

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.830 
there should also be another diagonal
crease<00:01:35.729> which<00:01:36.060> matches<00:01:36.420> up<00:01:36.540> with<00:01:36.659> this

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
crease which matches up with this

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.749 
crease which matches up with this
diagonal<00:01:37.320> line<00:01:38.869> fold<00:01:39.869> that<00:01:40.079> down<00:01:40.610> so<00:01:41.610> you're

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
diagonal line fold that down so you're

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.300 
diagonal line fold that down so you're
creative<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.450> flips<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.799> same<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.189> the

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
creative to flips to the same to the

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:55.289 
creative to flips to the same to the
other<00:01:44.369> side

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:58.510 

now<00:01:56.299> you've<00:01:56.420> got<00:01:56.600> a<00:01:56.630> triangle<00:01:57.280> fold<00:01:58.280> this

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
now you've got a triangle fold this

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.690 
now you've got a triangle fold this
point<00:01:58.820> down<00:01:59.030> to<00:01:59.210> the<00:01:59.330> bottom<00:01:59.510> line<00:02:03.549> now<00:02:04.549> you're

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
point down to the bottom line now you're

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.010 
point down to the bottom line now you're
going<00:02:04.850> to<00:02:04.940> sink<00:02:05.150> and<00:02:05.390> the<00:02:05.450> tip<00:02:05.720> of<00:02:05.840> the

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
going to sink and the tip of the

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.080 
going to sink and the tip of the
triangle<00:02:06.229> so<00:02:07.220> you're<00:02:07.369> going<00:02:07.580> to<00:02:07.759> make<00:02:07.909> the

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
triangle so you're going to make the

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.910 
triangle so you're going to make the
best<00:02:08.239> flower<00:02:08.569> so<00:02:08.929> if<00:02:09.080> this<00:02:09.289> is<00:02:09.440> how<00:02:09.619> it<00:02:09.679> go<00:02:09.860> to

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
best flower so if this is how it go to

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.680 
best flower so if this is how it go to
this<00:02:10.100> tutorial<00:02:10.729> so<00:02:11.060> it<00:02:11.239> might<00:02:11.360> be<00:02:11.480> a<00:02:11.510> little

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
this tutorial so it might be a little

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.120 
this tutorial so it might be a little
bit<00:02:11.840> easier<00:02:12.170> and<00:02:12.440> it<00:02:12.590> will<00:02:12.709> give<00:02:12.860> you<00:02:12.950> more

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
experience on doing this so i'll just

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.870 
experience on doing this so i'll just
link<00:02:15.380> the<00:02:15.530> tutorial<00:02:16.069> for<00:02:16.220> this<00:02:16.370> and<00:02:16.640> the<00:02:16.700> box

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
link the tutorial for this and the box

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.120 
link the tutorial for this and the box
below<00:02:17.180> the<00:02:17.209> video<00:02:17.590> so<00:02:18.590> you're<00:02:18.709> going<00:02:18.830> to<00:02:18.920> sink

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
below the video so you're going to sink

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:25.090 
below the video so you're going to sink
em<00:02:19.310> this<00:02:19.489> tip<00:02:20.560> so<00:02:21.560> unfold<00:02:22.280> it<00:02:23.739> crease<00:02:24.739> along

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
em this tip so unfold it crease along

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.310 
em this tip so unfold it crease along
here<00:02:25.400> put<00:02:26.000> your<00:02:26.150> thumb<00:02:26.510> and<00:02:26.750> finger

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
here put your thumb and finger

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.410 
here put your thumb and finger
underneath<00:02:27.590> so<00:02:28.550> that<00:02:28.580> will<00:02:28.880> make<00:02:29.000> it<00:02:29.120> easier

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
underneath so that will make it easier

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:40.720 
underneath so that will make it easier
to<00:02:29.480> crease<00:02:29.810> this<00:02:38.980> so<00:02:39.980> now<00:02:40.190> you<00:02:40.250> got<00:02:40.519> your

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
to crease this so now you got your

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:53.140 
to crease this so now you got your
octagon<00:02:42.190> sink<00:02:43.190> in<00:02:43.430> that<00:02:43.459> point<00:02:52.000> so<00:02:53.000> after

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
octagon sink in that point so after

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.060 
octagon sink in that point so after
sinking<00:02:53.690> in<00:02:53.780> that<00:02:53.810> point<00:02:54.230> you<00:02:54.410> grab<00:02:54.620> these<00:02:54.799> two

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
sinking in that point you grab these two

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.210 
sinking in that point you grab these two
flaps<00:02:55.340> of<00:02:55.549> the<00:02:55.610> front<00:02:56.739> hold<00:02:57.739> it<00:02:57.860> like<00:02:57.980> that

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
flaps of the front hold it like that

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.720 
flaps of the front hold it like that
then<00:02:58.540> you're<00:02:59.540> going<00:02:59.690> to<00:02:59.750> reverse<00:03:00.140> this<00:03:00.670> so<00:03:01.670> you

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
then you're going to reverse this so you

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:09.400 
then you're going to reverse this so you
have<00:03:01.940> to<00:03:02.120> pop<00:03:02.299> these<00:03:02.480> down<00:03:07.810> and<00:03:08.810> keep<00:03:09.049> holding

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
have to pop these down and keep holding

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.560 
have to pop these down and keep holding
that<00:03:12.519> now<00:03:13.519> on<00:03:13.700> the<00:03:13.820> sides<00:03:14.060> you've<00:03:14.239> got<00:03:14.420> this

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
that now on the sides you've got this

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.360 
that now on the sides you've got this
trapezium<00:03:14.810> you're<00:03:15.709> just<00:03:15.920> going<00:03:16.100> to<00:03:16.160> crease

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
trapezium you're just going to crease

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:26.660 
trapezium you're just going to crease
this<00:03:16.610> up

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:32.759 

so<00:03:27.670> it<00:03:27.879> should<00:03:28.060> look<00:03:28.209> like<00:03:28.269> that<00:03:31.739> then<00:03:32.739> you

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
so it should look like that then you

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:37.099 
so it should look like that then you
turn<00:03:33.040> this<00:03:33.219> page<00:03:33.810> fold<00:03:34.810> up<00:03:34.959> this<00:03:35.109> excess<00:03:35.530> paper

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
turn this page fold up this excess paper

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:40.020 
turn this page fold up this excess paper
fold<00:03:38.109> it<00:03:38.260> back<00:03:38.439> so<00:03:39.370> you're<00:03:39.489> just<00:03:39.579> making<00:03:39.939> a

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
fold it back so you're just making a

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.000 
fold it back so you're just making a
straight<00:03:40.269> line<00:03:40.450> on<00:03:40.629> the<00:03:40.719> trapezium<00:03:41.290> so<00:03:41.739> do<00:03:41.890> the

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
straight line on the trapezium so do the

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:48.030 
straight line on the trapezium so do the
same<00:03:42.250> to<00:03:42.400> the<00:03:42.489> other<00:03:42.549> side<00:03:46.739> now<00:03:47.739> turn<00:03:48.010> it

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
same to the other side now turn it

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.390 
same to the other side now turn it
around<00:03:48.599> and<00:03:49.599> then<00:03:49.629> turn<00:03:49.989> it<00:03:50.019> over<00:03:50.290> then<00:03:51.250> you

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
around and then turn it over then you

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.309 
around and then turn it over then you
fold<00:03:51.579> up<00:03:51.790> this<00:03:51.939> diagonal<00:03:52.450> edge<00:03:52.629> to<00:03:52.989> meet<00:03:53.170> this

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:53.319 
fold up this diagonal edge to meet this

00:03:53.319 --> 00:04:00.809 
fold up this diagonal edge to meet this
edge<00:03:57.480> and<00:03:58.480> crease<00:03:58.840> this<00:03:59.220> do<00:04:00.220> the<00:04:00.340> same<00:04:00.579> to<00:04:00.700> the

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
edge and crease this do the same to the

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:08.420 
edge and crease this do the same to the
other<00:04:00.849> side<00:04:01.180> so<00:04:01.419> you<00:04:01.480> get<00:04:01.629> a<00:04:01.659> triangle<00:04:02.079> shape

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.720 

then<00:04:09.430> you're<00:04:09.579> going<00:04:09.730> to<00:04:09.790> fold<00:04:09.970> it<00:04:10.180> in<00:04:10.299> half<00:04:10.650> and

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
then you're going to fold it in half and

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.670 
then you're going to fold it in half and
then<00:04:12.730> we<00:04:13.000> fold<00:04:13.359> it<00:04:13.510> that<00:04:13.629> triangle<00:04:13.959> shape<00:04:14.260> you

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
then we fold it that triangle shape you

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.099 
then we fold it that triangle shape you
fold<00:04:14.980> it<00:04:15.069> down<00:04:15.250> and<00:04:16.180> then<00:04:16.329> you<00:04:16.479> fold<00:04:16.660> the<00:04:16.780> flaps

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
fold it down and then you fold the flaps

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:26.700 
fold it down and then you fold the flaps
down<00:04:23.520> now<00:04:24.520> turn<00:04:24.759> it<00:04:24.789> over<00:04:25.050> you<00:04:26.050> put<00:04:26.289> this<00:04:26.440> bit

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
down now turn it over you put this bit

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.000 
down now turn it over you put this bit
now<00:04:27.280> in<00:04:27.460> between<00:04:27.940> these<00:04:28.240> Valley<00:04:28.599> folds<00:04:29.169> you're

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
now in between these Valley folds you're

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.029 
now in between these Valley folds you're
going<00:04:30.220> to<00:04:30.340> make<00:04:30.460> Mountain<00:04:30.909> folds<00:04:31.590> so<00:04:32.590> that's<00:04:32.860> a

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:33.039 
going to make Mountain folds so that's a

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:34.920 
going to make Mountain folds so that's a
valley<00:04:33.250> because<00:04:33.550> it's<00:04:33.849> like<00:04:34.000> a<00:04:34.030> V<00:04:34.240> shape<00:04:34.270> and

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
valley because it's like a V shape and

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.409 
valley because it's like a V shape and
then<00:04:35.260> a<00:04:35.320> mountain<00:04:35.710> fold<00:04:35.889> folding<00:04:36.460> it<00:04:36.610> out<00:04:36.729> so

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:37.419 
then a mountain fold folding it out so

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:39.950 
then a mountain fold folding it out so
that<00:04:37.630> it<00:04:37.750> sticks<00:04:37.960> out<00:04:38.169> like<00:04:38.229> a<00:04:38.409> mountain<00:04:38.800> and

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
that it sticks out like a mountain and

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.890 
that it sticks out like a mountain and
that's<00:04:40.960> valley-fold<00:04:42.419> you<00:04:43.419> do<00:04:43.659> another

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
that's valley-fold you do another

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:54.420 
that's valley-fold you do another
mountain<00:04:44.320> fold<00:04:50.699> that's<00:04:51.699> a<00:04:51.849> valley<00:04:52.060> fold<00:04:53.430> so

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
mountain fold that's a valley fold so

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:06.800 
mountain fold that's a valley fold so
you<00:04:54.520> do<00:04:54.669> the<00:04:54.699> same<00:04:54.970> to<00:04:55.180> the<00:04:55.270> other<00:04:55.300> side

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.080 

then<00:05:07.810> open<00:05:08.140> it<00:05:08.200> up<00:05:08.380> then<00:05:09.340> on<00:05:09.550> the<00:05:09.610> side<00:05:09.910> with

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
then open it up then on the side with

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.150 
then open it up then on the side with
the<00:05:10.120> flower<00:05:10.450> but<00:05:10.750> you're<00:05:11.260> going<00:05:11.530> to<00:05:11.680> fold<00:05:11.860> this

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 
the flower but you're going to fold this

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.970 
the flower but you're going to fold this
triangle<00:05:12.490> thing<00:05:12.910> so<00:05:13.720> from<00:05:14.020> this<00:05:14.230> crease<00:05:14.650> at

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:14.980 
triangle thing so from this crease at

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.970 
triangle thing so from this crease at
the<00:05:15.130> bottom<00:05:15.460> from<00:05:15.880> this<00:05:16.030> point<00:05:16.330> to<00:05:16.740> the<00:05:17.740> third

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:17.980 
the bottom from this point to the third

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:24.420 
the bottom from this point to the third
place<00:05:21.030> to<00:05:22.030> down<00:05:22.420> here<00:05:22.780> which<00:05:23.770> is<00:05:23.980> like<00:05:24.160> one

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
place to down here which is like one

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.700 
place to down here which is like one
centimeter<00:05:24.970> away<00:05:25.090> from<00:05:25.420> the<00:05:25.540> bottom<00:05:25.810> you're

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
centimeter away from the bottom you're

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.470 
centimeter away from the bottom you're
going<00:05:26.860> to<00:05:26.920> fold<00:05:27.040> a<00:05:27.190> triangle<00:05:27.430> shape<00:05:27.610> now<00:05:28.420> you

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:28.480 
going to fold a triangle shape now you

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.760 
going to fold a triangle shape now you
don't<00:05:28.720> have<00:05:28.750> to<00:05:28.870> draw<00:05:29.080> this<00:05:29.260> I'm<00:05:29.470> just<00:05:29.650> showing

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
don't have to draw this I'm just showing

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.190 
don't have to draw this I'm just showing
you<00:05:29.890> in<00:05:30.100> a<00:05:30.130> fold<00:05:30.400> in<00:05:30.640> from<00:05:31.480> this<00:05:31.690> point<00:05:31.960> you

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:32.200 
you in a fold in from this point you

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.610 
you in a fold in from this point you
make<00:05:32.380> a<00:05:32.410> valley<00:05:32.800> fold<00:05:33.840> in<00:05:34.840> a<00:05:34.960> mountain<00:05:35.380> code

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.620 
make a valley fold in a mountain code

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.620 
make a valley fold in a mountain code
and<00:05:35.950> then<00:05:36.220> a<00:05:36.250> valley<00:05:36.520> fold<00:05:36.610> so<00:05:37.420> you're<00:05:37.540> going

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630 
and then a valley fold so you're going

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.480 
and then a valley fold so you're going
to<00:05:37.720> fold<00:05:37.870> this<00:05:38.080> up<00:05:38.140> with<00:05:38.530> this<00:05:38.710> edge<00:05:39.040> meeting

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
to fold this up with this edge meeting

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:46.470 
to fold this up with this edge meeting
this<00:05:39.700> crease<00:05:44.460> so<00:05:45.460> that's<00:05:45.700> how<00:05:45.880> you<00:05:45.940> get<00:05:46.210> that

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:46.480 
this crease so that's how you get that

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.780 
this crease so that's how you get that
side<00:05:46.810> of<00:05:46.840> the<00:05:47.050> triangle<00:05:47.260> then<00:05:48.220> turn<00:05:48.520> it<00:05:48.550> and

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:48.790 
side of the triangle then turn it and

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:51.060 
side of the triangle then turn it and
then<00:05:48.970> fold<00:05:49.180> this<00:05:49.360> diagonally<00:05:49.930> and<00:05:50.110> just<00:05:50.860> leave

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:51.070 
then fold this diagonally and just leave

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:52.650 
then fold this diagonally and just leave
like<00:05:51.100> one<00:05:51.370> centimeter<00:05:52.060> strip<00:05:52.360> from<00:05:52.480> the

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:52.660 
like one centimeter strip from the

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:56.790 
like one centimeter strip from the
bottom<00:05:54.660> and<00:05:55.660> that's<00:05:55.930> how<00:05:56.110> you<00:05:56.170> get<00:05:56.350> that<00:05:56.560> side

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800 
bottom and that's how you get that side

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.560 
bottom and that's how you get that side
of<00:05:56.920> the<00:05:57.010> triangle<00:05:57.220> so<00:05:58.000> then<00:05:58.180> from<00:05:58.390> that<00:05:58.420> point

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:58.570 
of the triangle so then from that point

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:02.700 
of the triangle so then from that point
you<00:05:59.050> fold<00:05:59.290> up<00:05:59.410> a<00:05:59.500> valley<00:05:59.680> fold<00:06:01.440> and<00:06:02.440> when<00:06:02.590> you

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:02.710 
you fold up a valley fold and when you

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:04.200 
you fold up a valley fold and when you
fold<00:06:02.920> up<00:06:03.070> the<00:06:03.220> strip<00:06:03.460> thing<00:06:03.700> you<00:06:03.850> know<00:06:03.970> Rita

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:04.210 
fold up the strip thing you know Rita

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.990 
fold up the strip thing you know Rita
fold<00:06:04.480> the<00:06:04.570> other<00:06:04.600> strips<00:06:05.610> and<00:06:06.610> then<00:06:06.670> you<00:06:06.820> do

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.000 
fold the other strips and then you do

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.520 
fold the other strips and then you do
mountain<00:06:07.390> fold<00:06:07.660> and<00:06:08.350> then<00:06:09.130> a<00:06:09.160> valley<00:06:09.430> fold
