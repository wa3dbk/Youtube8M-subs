edit this part later we've got to make
the<00:00:43.320> actual<00:00:43.500> device<00:00:44.180> it's<00:00:45.180> three<00:00:45.480> tall<00:00:45.719> so

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
the actual device it's three tall so

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.690 
the actual device it's three tall so
you've<00:00:46.140> got<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.350> make<00:00:46.440> it<00:00:46.500> three<00:00:47.340> tall<00:00:47.550> of

course on the sides do this to both
sides<00:00:50.850> I<00:00:52.100> have<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.160> pre-measured<00:00:53.579> area<00:00:54.059> so<00:00:54.210> I

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
sides I have a pre-measured area so I

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.700 
sides I have a pre-measured area so I
know<00:00:54.329> exactly<00:00:54.510> how<00:00:54.989> why<00:00:55.170> it's<00:00:55.350> going<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.559> be

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
know exactly how why it's going to be

now<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:56.730> put<00:00:57.210> two<00:00:57.510> blocks<00:00:57.809> in<00:00:58.079> word<00:00:58.260> on<00:00:58.440> each

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
now you put two blocks in word on each

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:05.299 
now you put two blocks in word on each
side<00:00:59.300> give<00:01:00.300> me<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.510> sec<00:01:03.739> looks<00:01:04.739> like<00:01:04.860> an<00:01:04.979> H<00:01:05.129> with
