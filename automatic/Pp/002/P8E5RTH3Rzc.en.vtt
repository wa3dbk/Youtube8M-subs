00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.590
 so they fall in with another one 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:26.200
 red imagination again from 112 tech and 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:29.110
 Although a sick and fertilizer spreader for 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.550
 helicopter's working width is 36 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.010
 meter but he does not want to believe it 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.350
 for the narrow thing but it clear that 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.410
 We measured from the air up to 2000 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:41.020
 with 2300 children maintenance costs 130 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.239
 euro a day use is of course the 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.400
 start of fertilizer lime for the yield 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:52.120
 to increase their harvest 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:54.820
 well the thing as 2100 euro I have to 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.500
 say that I stand here I have it 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.410
 not yet made the thing to the 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.440
 to hang helicopter one has down though 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:09.580
 This camera when hooking one also has 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:10.050
 a ground camera and I know it 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.300
 Not 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.680
 I have to practice a little bit more 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.850
 have not have done so with the 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.440
 sweden and so on 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.940
 that cares really well but that 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.360
 is precise and I have to go that far 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.240
 to practice 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.039
 I think he 'll get something soon 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.000
 but have read it at the car 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:29.470
 best to read automator 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.429
 I I grab the link in the course 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.709
 video description 1 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:37.030
 read the picture by standing by it 

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:38.530
 that it's the one you fly with 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.319
 melitta very much is the 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.179
 Fluctuations drastically changed 

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:44.890
 whatever I can imagine hangs 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:45.929
 partly including helicopter the picture 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.100
 is wavering 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:51.310
 you have to practice a bit but 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.720
 this is suitable for large fields 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.319
 Of course, it will of course also notice something 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:58.270
 make it schrebergarten bethel here 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:02:01.450
 Although forbid but helicopter 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:05.789
 renting fertilizer certainly will impress 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:08.660
 the neighboring countries is then it was and 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:10.190
 as I said I like it very much 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.480
 the helicopter also maybe the 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:16.640
 paint and so on deserts thaya 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.410
 but maybe it would be a bit happy too 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.070
 until something cheerful can do right 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.490
 but in itself that is a first horny 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.710
 part 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.910
 and as I said here it is now about 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:31.550
 a thin tax so already from 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:35.660
 europallette with hooks and so on 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:37.940
 it's nice to exhibit around the yard and have fun 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.430
 have and friends 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.560
 I wanted to show you that we'll see each other 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.070
 the next presentation until then is 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.070
