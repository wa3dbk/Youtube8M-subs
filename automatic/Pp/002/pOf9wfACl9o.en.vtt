thing<00:03:44.520> is<00:03:44.550> mainly<00:03:44.819> through<00:03:45.000> question<00:03:45.390> here

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
thing is mainly through question here

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.770 
thing is mainly through question here
from<00:03:45.569> talking<00:03:45.930> to<00:03:46.170> npcs<00:03:46.800> so<00:03:47.520> no<00:03:48.150> grinding

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
from talking to npcs so no grinding

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.680
