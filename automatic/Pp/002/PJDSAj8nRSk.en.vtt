7<00:00:07.379> and<00:00:08.040> this<00:00:08.910> is<00:00:09.120> the<00:00:09.330> worst<00:00:09.540> of<00:00:09.719> all<00:00:09.840> the<00:00:10.050> Iron

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
7 and this is the worst of all the Iron

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.150 
7 and this is the worst of all the Iron
Man<00:00:10.469> figures<00:00:10.950> I<00:00:11.190> was<00:00:12.030> hoping<00:00:12.330> that<00:00:12.389> because<00:00:12.870> he

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.160 
Man figures I was hoping that because he

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.799 
Man figures I was hoping that because he
he<00:00:14.160> was<00:00:14.429> definitely<00:00:14.700> a<00:00:14.969> different<00:00:15.360> mold<00:00:15.540> than

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
he was definitely a different mold than

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.189 
he was definitely a different mold than
the<00:00:16.130> first<00:00:17.130> one<00:00:17.310> that<00:00:17.460> got<00:00:17.670> repainted<00:00:18.449> into

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
the first one that got repainted into

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.650 
the first one that got repainted into
the<00:00:19.350> black<00:00:19.890> reactron<00:00:20.460> armored<00:00:20.910> Iron<00:00:21.119> Man<00:00:21.330> I

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
the black reactron armored Iron Man I

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.810 
the black reactron armored Iron Man I
was<00:00:22.529> hoping<00:00:22.830> this<00:00:22.980> one<00:00:23.160> would<00:00:23.279> be<00:00:23.310> somewhat

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
was hoping this one would be somewhat

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.460 
was hoping this one would be somewhat
different<00:00:24.029> because<00:00:24.240> it<00:00:24.539> is<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.900> different<00:00:25.230> mold

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
different because it is a different mold

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.080 
different because it is a different mold
like<00:00:25.710> rather<00:00:25.949> than<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.369> triangle<00:00:26.670> it's<00:00:27.000> a

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
like rather than the triangle it's a

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.750 
like rather than the triangle it's a
circle<00:00:27.449> but<00:00:27.630> no<00:00:28.529> this<00:00:28.980> is<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.250> worst<00:00:29.460> of<00:00:29.609> them

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
circle but no this is the worst of them

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.150 
circle but no this is the worst of them
all<00:00:29.910> first<00:00:30.330> of<00:00:30.510> all<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:31.109> big<00:00:31.500> problem<00:00:31.890> for<00:00:32.040> me

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
all first of all the big problem for me

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.630 
all first of all the big problem for me
is<00:00:32.340> you<00:00:33.059> see<00:00:33.239> how<00:00:33.360> it's<00:00:33.540> kind<00:00:33.780> of<00:00:33.809> looking<00:00:33.930> down

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
is you see how it's kind of looking down

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.209 
is you see how it's kind of looking down
that's<00:00:35.640> as<00:00:35.910> high<00:00:36.120> up<00:00:36.270> as<00:00:36.420> he<00:00:36.540> can<00:00:36.719> look<00:00:36.980> that<00:00:37.980> is

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
that's as high up as he can look that is

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.900 
that's as high up as he can look that is
unforgivable<00:00:38.820> almost<00:00:40.219> that<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.370> head<00:00:41.579> can't

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
unforgivable almost that the head can't

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.569 
unforgivable almost that the head can't
do<00:00:42.570> anything<00:00:42.780> for<00:00:43.230> no<00:00:43.559> reason<00:00:43.890> other<00:00:43.980> than<00:00:44.100> bad

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
do anything for no reason other than bad

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.940 
do anything for no reason other than bad
sculpting<00:00:45.329> then<00:00:45.989> he<00:00:46.079> has<00:00:46.200> all<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.559> same<00:00:46.739> bad

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
sculpting then he has all the same bad

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.279 
sculpting then he has all the same bad
poseability<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.030> other<00:00:48.660> Iron<00:00:49.050> Man

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
poseability of the other Iron Man

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.319 
poseability of the other Iron Man
figures<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:50.219> same<00:00:50.489> bad<00:00:50.760> stand<00:00:51.539> ability<00:00:52.079> and

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
figures the same bad stand ability and

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.700 
figures the same bad stand ability and
well<00:00:54.329> worth<00:00:54.690> standard<00:00:55.140> only<00:00:55.199> because<00:00:55.500> he<00:00:55.590> has

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
well worth standard only because he has

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.170 
well worth standard only because he has
awful<00:00:56.309> knees<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:58.100> yeah<00:00:59.100> this<00:00:59.250> figure<00:00:59.789> is<00:00:59.879> just

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180

thought<00:01:04.860> that<00:01:05.070> Iron<00:01:05.280> Man<00:01:05.519> figures<00:01:05.820> would<00:01:06.119> be

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
thought that Iron Man figures would be

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.109 
thought that Iron Man figures would be
you<00:01:07.979> know<00:01:08.100> cool<00:01:08.340> beans<00:01:08.580> they<00:01:08.729> would<00:01:08.850> sell<00:01:09.090> well

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
you know cool beans they would sell well

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.039 
you know cool beans they would sell well
because<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:10.430> house<00:01:11.430> were<00:01:11.640> made<00:01:11.880> of<00:01:12.119> three<00:01:12.930> of

specific<00:01:25.560> gimmick<00:01:26.040> for<00:01:26.220> this<00:01:26.460> one<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:26.880> he<00:01:27.000> has

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
specific gimmick for this one is he has

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.700 
specific gimmick for this one is he has
this<00:01:27.619> weird<00:01:29.090> shield<00:01:30.090> saw<00:01:30.720> blade<00:01:31.020> spinny<00:01:31.409> thing

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
this weird shield saw blade spinny thing

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.679 
this weird shield saw blade spinny thing
you<00:01:32.400> can<00:01:32.549> hold<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:32.820> in<00:01:32.909> his<00:01:33.030> hand

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
you can hold it in his hand

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.350 
you can hold it in his hand
laughably<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:35.400> can<00:01:35.579> clip<00:01:35.759> on<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.210> his

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
laughably and you can clip on to his

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.870 
laughably and you can clip on to his
wrist<00:01:36.659> clipping<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:37.619> on<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.890> his<00:01:38.009> wrist<00:01:38.250> is<00:01:38.520> the

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
wrist clipping it on to his wrist is the

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.080 
wrist clipping it on to his wrist is the
best<00:01:39.479> way<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.780> do<00:01:40.170> it<00:01:40.320> I<00:01:40.610> guess<00:01:41.610> then<00:01:41.820> it

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
best way to do it I guess then it

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.550 
best way to do it I guess then it
actually<00:01:42.270> kind<00:01:42.600> of<00:01:42.630> looks<00:01:42.810> like<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:42.990> shield<00:01:43.290> and

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
actually kind of looks like a shield and

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.789 
actually kind of looks like a shield and
that's<00:01:44.220> actually<00:01:47.570> excuse<00:01:48.570> me<00:01:48.799> that's

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
that's actually excuse me that's

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.319 
that's actually excuse me that's
actually<00:01:50.009> not<00:01:50.490> too<00:01:50.820> bad

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
actually not too bad

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:57.289 
actually not too bad
I<00:01:51.360> don't<00:01:51.689> mind<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:55.549> it's<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.790> it's<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.149> only

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
I don't mind it it's the it's the only

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.630 
I don't mind it it's the it's the only
saving<00:01:57.659> grace<00:01:57.780> of<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.170> figure<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.590> it's<00:01:59.549> a

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
saving grace of the figure and it's a

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.910 
saving grace of the figure and it's a
gimmick<00:01:59.939> that<00:01:59.969> was<00:02:00.329> done<00:02:00.810> better<00:02:01.079> by<00:02:01.380> Captain

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
gimmick that was done better by Captain

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.980 
gimmick that was done better by Captain
