00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
little later it's time to start our test

how<00:00:55.899> far<00:00:56.260> do<00:00:56.409> you<00:00:56.470> think<00:00:56.559> your<00:00:56.829> rocket<00:00:57.190> will<00:00:57.309> go

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
how far do you think your rocket will go

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.610 
how far do you think your rocket will go
do<00:00:58.570> you<00:00:58.659> think<00:00:58.690> it'll<00:00:59.079> make<00:00:59.170> any<00:00:59.500> difference

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
do you think it'll make any difference

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.680 
do you think it'll make any difference
when<00:01:00.309> the<00:01:00.430> nose<00:01:00.579> cone<00:01:00.850> and<00:01:01.059> fins<00:01:01.269> are<00:01:01.449> at<00:01:01.540> it

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
when the nose cone and fins are at it

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.290

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:04.300 
remember to make a fair test you should

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.820 
remember to make a fair test you should
try<00:01:04.629> to<00:01:04.690> launch<00:01:04.960> your<00:01:05.110> rocket<00:01:05.170> from<00:01:05.530> the<00:01:05.590> same

did the rocket go further when the fins
were<00:01:45.850> touched<00:01:47.009> now<00:01:48.009> you<00:01:48.070> need<00:01:48.340> to<00:01:48.460> add<00:01:48.580> a<00:01:48.610> nose

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
were touched now you need to add a nose

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:51.480 
were touched now you need to add a nose
cone<00:01:49.240> to<00:01:49.450> your<00:01:49.570> rocket<00:01:49.930> you<00:01:50.799> can<00:01:50.979> make<00:01:51.159> a<00:01:51.189> cone

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
cone to your rocket you can make a cone

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:52.859 
cone to your rocket you can make a cone
by<00:01:51.700> using<00:01:51.909> something<00:01:52.420> round

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
by using something round

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:55.840 
by using something round
to<00:01:52.960> cut<00:01:53.110> a<00:01:53.140> circular<00:01:53.439> piece<00:01:53.830> of<00:01:53.979> paper

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
to cut a circular piece of paper

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.510 
to cut a circular piece of paper
next<00:01:56.720> cut<00:01:57.290> a<00:01:57.320> slice<00:01:57.590> of<00:01:57.620> paper<00:01:57.979> out<00:01:58.250> of<00:01:58.400> the

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
next cut a slice of paper out of the

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.030 
next cut a slice of paper out of the
circle<00:01:58.909> overlap<00:01:59.750> the<00:01:59.930> edges<00:02:00.110> and<00:02:00.470> tape<00:02:00.890> them

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
circle overlap the edges and tape them

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.399 
circle overlap the edges and tape them
in<00:02:01.159> place<00:02:01.400> to<00:02:01.610> make<00:02:01.760> the<00:02:01.880> cone<00:02:02.200> use<00:02:03.200> some

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
in place to make the cone use some

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:05.290 
in place to make the cone use some
sellotape<00:02:03.740> to<00:02:04.100> stick<00:02:04.310> the<00:02:04.460> cone<00:02:04.670> onto<00:02:04.940> the<00:02:05.150> end

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
sellotape to stick the cone onto the end

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:11.520 
sellotape to stick the cone onto the end
of<00:02:05.390> your<00:02:05.540> rocket

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.950 

like<00:02:12.190> before<00:02:12.370> with<00:02:12.730> the<00:02:12.850> fins<00:02:13.090> launch<00:02:13.810> your

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
like before with the fins launch your

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.750 
like before with the fins launch your
rocket<00:02:14.020> three<00:02:14.500> times<00:02:14.800> and<00:02:15.160> measure<00:02:15.520> each

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
rocket three times and measure each

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.270 
rocket three times and measure each

far<00:02:18.310> did<00:02:18.730> the<00:02:18.820> rocket<00:02:19.120> go<00:02:19.240> this<00:02:19.480> time<00:02:19.560> why<00:02:20.560> do

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
far did the rocket go this time why do

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.050 
far did the rocket go this time why do
you<00:02:20.800> think<00:02:20.950> this<00:02:21.130> might<00:02:21.280> be<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.490> case

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.120 

can<00:02:24.750> you<00:02:24.840> think<00:02:24.990> of<00:02:25.140> other<00:02:25.319> things<00:02:25.709> you<00:02:25.980> could

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
can you think of other things you could

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.680 
can you think of other things you could
do<00:02:26.310> to<00:02:26.459> your<00:02:26.490> rocket<00:02:26.910> to<00:02:27.030> change<00:02:27.270> how<00:02:27.420> far<00:02:27.630> it

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
do to your rocket to change how far it

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.840 
do to your rocket to change how far it
