00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
we've been working together for 30 years

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.019 
we've been working together for 30 years
now<00:00:02.850> if<00:00:03.689> there's<00:00:04.080> three<00:00:04.710> ideas<00:00:05.220> presented<00:00:05.670> to

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
now if there's three ideas presented to

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.629 
now if there's three ideas presented to
both<00:00:06.240> of<00:00:06.420> us<00:00:06.509> we<00:00:07.500> pick<00:00:07.770> the<00:00:07.919> same<00:00:08.130> one<00:00:09.710> as<00:00:10.710> the

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
both of us we pick the same one as the

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.940 
both of us we pick the same one as the
years<00:00:12.059> went<00:00:12.300> on<00:00:12.450> and<00:00:12.900> we<00:00:13.139> made<00:00:13.349> more<00:00:13.590> and<00:00:13.740> more

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
years went on and we made more and more

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.250 
years went on and we made more and more
side-scrolling<00:00:14.580> games<00:00:14.880> we<00:00:15.599> had<00:00:15.780> to<00:00:15.900> create<00:00:16.170> a

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
side-scrolling games we had to create a

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.630 
side-scrolling games we had to create a
more<00:00:16.680> advanced<00:00:16.949> tool<00:00:17.310> to<00:00:17.580> design<00:00:17.880> them<00:00:18.029> with

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.340 

this<00:00:23.640> became<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.240> basis<00:00:24.630> of<00:00:24.810> Super<00:00:25.170> Mario

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
this became the basis of Super Mario

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.730 
this became the basis of Super Mario
maker<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:26.340> tool<00:00:26.550> got<00:00:26.760> so<00:00:27.150> good<00:00:27.480> that<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:28.529> more

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
maker the tool got so good that the more

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.410 
maker the tool got so good that the more
we<00:00:28.859> worked<00:00:29.099> with<00:00:29.310> it<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.640> more<00:00:29.820> we<00:00:30.000> realized

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
we worked with it the more we realized

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.420 
we worked with it the more we realized
we<00:00:30.720> could<00:00:30.960> also<00:00:31.230> turn<00:00:31.769> it<00:00:31.949> into<00:00:32.070> something

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
we could also turn it into something

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.850 
we could also turn it into something
everyone<00:00:33.000> could<00:00:33.270> enjoy<00:00:33.420> with<00:00:34.170> Super<00:00:34.620> Mario

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.980 

in<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.860> old<00:01:35.009> days<00:01:35.310> when<00:01:35.820> we<00:01:36.030> needed<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.420> fix<00:01:36.719> or

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
in the old days when we needed a fix or

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.929 
in the old days when we needed a fix or
change<00:01:37.350> part<00:01:37.680> of<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.860> course<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.640> would<00:01:38.820> get

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
change part of the course it would get

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.209 
change part of the course it would get
really<00:01:39.270> messy<00:01:39.719> if<00:01:39.899> we<00:01:40.049> tried<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.350> edit<00:01:40.860> the

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:41.219 
really messy if we tried to edit the

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:43.819 
really messy if we tried to edit the
original<00:01:41.670> drawing<00:01:41.960> so<00:01:42.960> we'd<00:01:43.229> put<00:01:43.590> this

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
original drawing so we'd put this

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.270 
original drawing so we'd put this
see-through<00:01:44.100> paper<00:01:44.520> on<00:01:44.729> top<00:01:44.969> to<00:01:45.179> make<00:01:45.210> edits<00:01:45.630> a

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
times I start by making a course I want

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:25.690 
times I start by making a course I want
to<00:03:19.769> play<00:03:20.090> which<00:03:21.090> is<00:03:21.120> usually<00:03:21.840> like<00:03:22.430> 2<00:03:23.430> 1<00:03:23.849> or<00:03:24.269> 2<00:03:24.870> 2

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
to play which is usually like 2 1 or 2 2

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.509 
to play which is usually like 2 1 or 2 2
once<00:03:26.700> that's<00:03:27.090> done<00:03:27.420> we<00:03:28.290> try<00:03:28.680> to<00:03:28.739> make<00:03:29.130> it<00:03:29.160> a

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
once that's done we try to make it a

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:34.220 
once that's done we try to make it a
little<00:03:29.970> easier<00:03:30.569> so<00:03:31.109> we<00:03:31.980> move<00:03:32.220> on<00:03:32.489> to<00:03:33.120> making<00:03:33.389> 1

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
little easier so we move on to making 1

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.550 
little easier so we move on to making 1
1<00:03:34.650> it's<00:03:35.340> always<00:03:35.730> like<00:03:35.940> that<00:03:35.970> I<00:03:36.419> may<00:03:37.349> come

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
1 it's always like that I may come

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.589 
1 it's always like that I may come
across<00:03:37.859> as<00:03:38.099> a<00:03:38.130> mean<00:03:38.430> person<00:03:38.700> by<00:03:39.090> saying<00:03:39.329> this

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 
across as a mean person by saying this

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:42.979 
across as a mean person by saying this
but<00:03:39.959> in<00:03:40.230> 1:1<00:03:41.189> there's<00:03:41.849> a<00:03:41.970> Goomba<00:03:42.599> which<00:03:42.840> is

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
but in 1:1 there's a Goomba which is

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:44.230 
but in 1:1 there's a Goomba which is
clearly<00:03:43.349> an<00:03:43.590> enemy

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:44.240 
clearly an enemy

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.090 
clearly an enemy
but<00:03:44.450> there's<00:03:44.630> also<00:03:44.810> a<00:03:45.020> super<00:03:45.500> mushroom<00:03:45.830> and

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
but there's also a super mushroom and

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.680 
but there's also a super mushroom and
you<00:03:46.490> might<00:03:46.700> run<00:03:47.180> when<00:03:47.510> you<00:03:47.630> first<00:03:47.900> see<00:03:48.290> it<00:03:49.690> you

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
you might run when you first see it you

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.930 
you might run when you first see it you
run<00:03:50.960> but<00:03:51.530> there's<00:03:51.710> a<00:03:51.770> block<00:03:52.040> above<00:03:52.400> so<00:03:52.880> you

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
run but there's a block above so you

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.390 
run but there's a block above so you
can't<00:03:53.240> run<00:03:53.450> so<00:03:54.110> if<00:03:54.230> you<00:03:54.350> jump<00:03:54.620> the<00:03:54.920> ceiling<00:03:55.280> is

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
can't run so if you jump the ceiling is

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:02.140 
can't run so if you jump the ceiling is
low<00:03:55.580> so<00:03:55.880> you<00:03:55.940> usually<00:03:56.210> hit<00:03:56.630> it<00:04:00.910> but<00:04:01.910> when<00:04:02.060> you

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
low so you usually hit it but when you

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:08.830 
low so you usually hit it but when you
do<00:04:02.390> you<00:04:03.320> grow<00:04:03.530> big<00:04:03.740> it's<00:04:04.400> a<00:04:04.490> surprise<00:04:07.840> there

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
first gap has a floor and the second one

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.160

is the one you want to avoid because

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:21.010 
is the one you want to avoid because
it's<00:04:18.680> bottomless<00:04:19.040> so<00:04:19.670> it's<00:04:19.940> a<00:04:20.150> tutorial<00:04:20.420> in<00:04:20.930> a

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:21.020 
it's bottomless so it's a tutorial in a

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:22.900 
it's bottomless so it's a tutorial in a
sense<00:04:21.260> we<00:04:21.890> put<00:04:22.070> a<00:04:22.100> lot<00:04:22.250> of<00:04:22.370> thought<00:04:22.550> into<00:04:22.580> those

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
sense we put a lot of thought into those

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.880 
sense we put a lot of thought into those
types<00:04:23.210> of<00:04:23.360> things<00:04:23.600> when<00:04:24.140> playing<00:04:24.410> a<00:04:24.590> Mario

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
because they can't make the jump but

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.730 
because they can't make the jump but
