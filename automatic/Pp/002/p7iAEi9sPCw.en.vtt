so<00:02:07.520> I<00:02:07.549> guess<00:02:07.820> rule<00:02:08.119> number<00:02:08.300> one<00:02:08.600> is<00:02:08.840> don't<00:02:08.979> fall

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
so I guess rule number one is don't fall

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.190 
so I guess rule number one is don't fall
off<00:02:10.160> your<00:02:10.369> bike<00:02:10.399> and<00:02:10.789> get<00:02:11.060> decapitated

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
off your bike and get decapitated

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.050
