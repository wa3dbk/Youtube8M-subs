am the Lord and I think it's very

am the Lord and I think it's very
important<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.789> take<00:00:47.940> this<00:00:48.149> look<00:00:48.450> but<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.780> take

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
important to take this look but to take

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.350 
important to take this look but to take
a<00:00:49.020> look<00:00:49.140> at<00:00:49.260> this<00:00:49.350> verse<00:00:49.559> in<00:00:49.829> context<00:00:50.550> because

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
a look at this verse in context because

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.200 
a look at this verse in context because
if<00:00:51.690> we<00:00:52.140> are<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.770> highlight<00:00:53.309> that<00:00:53.610> Scripture

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
if we are to highlight that Scripture

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.139 
if we are to highlight that Scripture
and<00:00:54.449> make<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.410> pretext<00:00:56.129> for<00:00:56.190> our<00:00:56.430> context

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
and make it a pretext for our context

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.819 
and make it a pretext for our context
we're<00:00:57.360> taking<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:57.780> scripture<00:00:58.140> out<00:00:58.289> of<00:00:58.350> text

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
we're taking that scripture out of text

00:00:58.829 --> 00:00:59.569 
we're taking that scripture out of text
and<00:00:58.920> that's<00:00:59.010> where<00:00:59.219> it<00:00:59.309> gets<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.550> little

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
and that's where it gets a little

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:00.380 
and that's where it gets a little
confusing

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
confusing

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.810 
confusing
now<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.620> scriptures<00:01:02.039> before<00:01:02.340> that<00:01:02.489> also

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
now the scriptures before that also

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.149 
now the scriptures before that also
speak<00:01:03.059> about<00:01:03.180> eating<00:01:03.690> non<00:01:03.899> kosher<00:01:04.140> meat<00:01:04.530> so

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
speak about eating non kosher meat so

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.250 
speak about eating non kosher meat so
are<00:01:05.549> you<00:01:05.670> gonna<00:01:05.790> give<00:01:06.000> up<00:01:06.150> like<00:01:06.360> chorizo<00:01:06.659> and

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
are you gonna give up like chorizo and

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.990 
are you gonna give up like chorizo and
hamburgers<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:07.740> pork<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.520> stuff<00:01:08.729> like<00:01:08.850> that

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
hamburgers and pork and stuff like that

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.859 
hamburgers and pork and stuff like that
or<00:01:09.150> are<00:01:09.210> you<00:01:10.369> not<00:01:11.369> gonna<00:01:11.640> trim<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.360> size<00:01:12.600> of

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
or are you not gonna trim the size of

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.539 
or are you not gonna trim the size of
your<00:01:12.990> hair<00:01:13.229> or<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.740> end<00:01:13.920> of<00:01:14.070> your<00:01:14.189> beards

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
your hair or the end of your beards

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.210 
your hair or the end of your beards
because<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:14.850> also<00:01:15.030> speaks<00:01:15.450> that<00:01:15.890> law<00:01:16.890> for<00:01:17.130> the

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
because it also speaks that law for the

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.850 
because it also speaks that law for the
Levites<00:01:17.580> so<00:01:18.479> it's<00:01:18.780> kind<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.049> important<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.439> a

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
Levites so it's kind of important that a

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.149 
Levites so it's kind of important that a
I'm<00:01:20.189> not<00:01:20.670> only<00:01:21.119> bite<00:01:21.330> but<00:01:21.869> also<00:01:22.259> take<00:01:22.590> in<00:01:22.799> the

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
I'm not only bite but also take in the

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.429 
I'm not only bite but also take in the
cultural<00:01:23.729> context<00:01:24.270> of<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.540> time<00:01:24.750> is<00:01:24.960> that

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
cultural context of the time is that

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.320 
cultural context of the time is that
this<00:01:25.619> was<00:01:25.890> mandated<00:01:26.850> because<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.119> Lord

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
this was mandated because the Lord

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.999 
this was mandated because the Lord
wanted<00:01:27.600> them<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.869> be<00:01:27.990> consecrated<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:28.829> set

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
wanted them to be consecrated and set

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.899 
wanted them to be consecrated and set
apart<00:01:29.310> from<00:01:30.560> the<00:01:31.560> pagan<00:01:31.979> idolatrous<00:01:32.850> worship

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
apart from the pagan idolatrous worship

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.969 
apart from the pagan idolatrous worship
that<00:01:33.360> was<00:01:33.450> going<00:01:33.720> on<00:01:33.840> at<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.140> time<00:01:34.170> so<00:01:34.950> I

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
that was going on at that time so I

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.069 
that was going on at that time so I
think<00:01:35.070> it's<00:01:35.220> really<00:01:35.460> important<00:01:36.000> she<00:01:36.450> really

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
think it's really important she really

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.940 
think it's really important she really
asked<00:01:37.590> is<00:01:37.710> is<00:01:38.869> tattooing<00:01:39.869> a<00:01:39.960> form<00:01:40.229> of<00:01:40.409> pagan

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
asked is is tattooing a form of pagan
