00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.480
 very good to all welcome to a 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.269
 new gifted video in which it will be 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.939
 another guide and this guide deals with blogs 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.850
 e iker how will you build blogs and iker and them 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.500
 I will explain what the good is about 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.890
 melee a carrier and a 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.899
 excellent hunter especially hunting the 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.450
 stands because they would be their prey more 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.610
 easy and good as knowing your powers 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.649
 okay now let's go with the first power 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.410
 of blog seiquer which would be fury 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.000
 bloody that affects the same hero and 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.149
 it can also affect a hero 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.160
 Allied this skill is magical 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.649
 and if it crosses the immunity of spells 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.840
 in itself what this skill is about 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.989
 that by placing it in blocks and iker 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.510
 grants 40% of the year plus and 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.210
 25% life regeneration 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.940
 kill the prey eg halal puig 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:16.980
 I speak taker took a lot of life and top 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:20.460
 is maximum is a year with his first 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:22.170
 he heals what he has lost, it serves him very much 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.540
 I speak taker because that's a good way 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.600
 hunter the second power of blogs and iker 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.490
 it is rite of blood this kind of hard damage 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.950
 and does not go through the immunity of spells 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.110
 that is to say with I fit I do not know that no 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.120
 would have any effect with his second and 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.420
 good in what the power consists is that 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:42.000
 draw a circle which silences the 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.820
 beings that are around him and if what 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.710
 you combine well with your first power you can 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.040
 get to heal the damage that you have 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:53.580
 done for example if you give your first 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:56.250
 sign to feel same and you put the circle and 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.200
 at the moment of killing the enemy you are 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.610
 healing everything you've lost and the 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.370
 the same time you have silenced your enemies 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.890
 thing that would be a very easy prey well 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.950
 the third power of blood seiquer is to be 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.899
 which is a passive ability that if 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.480
 traverses the immunity of spells in 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.250
 What this skill consists of is that 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.010
 moment of falling an enemy hero with 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.840
 very little life I know you will detect it by 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.990
 missing his blood thing that will take him 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.660
 directly towards him for example 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:28.770
 Seiquer cloud has much more speed 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.910
 being with being activated and it's easier 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.710
 clear for him 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.750
 thing that also activates its first 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.910
 you can heal and kill the enemy 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.920
 easily to think it from any 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.960
 part of the map that is not that 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.790
 you get to cure the room in time 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.700
 be the last and blogging and that the 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.830
 break this kind of pure damage and if 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.560
 crosses the immunity spells by 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.810
 example walks a wild hero walking 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.120
 quietly by his side and block 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.190
 Seiquer detects it so he activates his 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.080
 sixth this makes the enemy eros 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.880
 begins to bleed and thing that 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.310
 when he walks he starts to bleed more 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.680
 that makes the blog prey the kers 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.780
 be much easier for him now 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.850
 let's move on to how to arm blood seiquer 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.070
 well we are here with the lord of the 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.319
 store and the two courier to teach us 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:19.349
 how to love blood shayk 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:19.349
 first , power boots are recommended 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.290
 vladimir to be able to heal if they are in 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:28.090
 a battle 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:31.660
 upset and pass it to relieve me to unite 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.980
 and blood either with this will be 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.800
 armed as hunters 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.160
 professionals 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:42.030
 then they can pass 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:44.040

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:48.180
 you want to with the hormone rod do not 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:50.250
 will leave no guaranteed mixer 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.739
 and with radiants they can burn their 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:56.650
 objectives and they can be invisible or if 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:58.510
 they are within a very far reach of you 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.480
 which would also help them a lot 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:04.209
 I recommend you sincerely radiance 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.159
 and finally if there are many who have 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:09.310
 many problems a lot of magic can 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:12.459
 used fecal but if not then 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.530
 they can use a butterfly to make them 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:17.019
 giving my pure and never are they 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:20.109
