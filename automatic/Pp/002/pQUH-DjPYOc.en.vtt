00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:06.089
Before Andy Warhol was the Pop Art icon that
he is know as today, he was a commercial illustrator.

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:12.879
And, Quite a successful one too, known for
his blotted-ink drawings of shoes for advertisements,

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:15.089
and designs of album covers.

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.750
For years, he worked with pop motifs, and
admired the works of Robert Rauschenberg and

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:25.070
Jasper Johns, but always as an outsider. At
this time, he didn’t have his own subject

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:26.960
or style as a fine artist.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:33.590
Following the work of European Pop artists
Eduardo Paolozzi and Richard Hamilton, Warhol

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.950
made an artwork featuring a Coca Cola bottle.
But instead of collage or using the brand

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:44.210
as a component in the work as they had, the
bottle was the sole motif.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:50.150
Warhol simplified the bottle to a graphic
image, placed beside it’s recognizable logo.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.700
It was too subjective. Warhol couldn’t resist
the painterly brushstrokes that one would

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:03.060
associate with abstract expressionism. They
undermined the otherwise detached, coolness of the image.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:08.120
Warhol would continue to experiment with style
and subjects in his paintings: black and white

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.800
paintings of photos from a newspaper, allowing
drips of paint to fall from the text.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.450
He often asked for suggestions of what to
paint, and when one person suggested the most

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:25.240
pervasive piece of pop culture - like a dollar
bill or a stick of chewing gum - Warhol would

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.880
begin to take images that were already really
popular, and filled with mass appeal. He would

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.450
begin to make images as bold and brash as
the advertisements themselves.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.740
Warhol believed that there were were two ways
to interpret the icons and artifacts of the

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.729
consumer boom:
1. The idealized perfect people and objects

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:51.700
as cliches or classicism; or
2. seen as crass or exploitative.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.700
This “low” motif’s psychological tension
was full of possibilities.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:04.060
For twenty years, Warhol had the same exact
lunch every single day: A slice of bread and

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:10.520
a can of Campbell’s soup. And he decided
to paint the can of very variety of Campbell’s soup.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.950
While he couldn’t find a gallery that would
show his work in New York, he did find one

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:21.950
in Los Angeles. In July of 1962, at Irving
Blum’s Ferus Gallery, 32 paintings of Andy

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.459
Warhol’s Campbell's Soup Cans were exhibited.

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:33.260
They hung in a single horizontal line, supported
by a very shallow, white shelf. Not unlike

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.050
the shelf of a grocery store.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.030
For Warhol, these were the most literal depiction
of mass consumption.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.980
These paintings were silkscreened, which is
a printmaking method originally used for advertising.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:53.520
It’s a semi-mechanized process, in which
he can paint the base image of the can over

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:59.290
and over on different canvases. And then he
would go in and hand-paint or stencil the

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.239
individual names of the soup varieties.

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:06.680
Gone were the individual’s stokes from the
artist’s hands, it’s absence replaced

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.660
with a cold detachedness.

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:14.390
The repetitive nature parodies the methods
of modern advertising, the bombardment of

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:20.660
the same image over and over in order to infiltrate
the consumer’s consciousness.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:26.050
This uniformity also went against the traditional
art market - art was supposed to unique, and

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.440
rare and precious. Not mass produced.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.879
These soup cans would not only become the
defining work of Andy Warhol’s fine art

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:39.819
career, but Pop Art itself - it’s obsession
with mass production and consumer culture.
