for<00:02:48.519> me<00:02:48.640> as<00:02:48.880> a<00:02:49.209> development<00:02:49.720> engineer<00:02:50.170> was<00:02:50.380> he

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
for me as a development engineer was he

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.080 
for me as a development engineer was he
where<00:02:50.650> somebody<00:02:50.890> could<00:02:51.040> go<00:02:51.250> to<00:02:51.310> you<00:02:51.640> could<00:02:51.820> sit

where somebody could go to you could sit

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.390 
where somebody could go to you could sit
down<00:02:52.299> talk<00:02:52.600> about<00:02:52.900> an<00:02:53.049> idea<00:02:53.410> he<00:02:54.100> would<00:02:54.250> ask

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
down talk about an idea he would ask

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.479 
down talk about an idea he would ask
very<00:02:54.790> critical<00:02:55.299> questions<00:02:55.840> if<00:02:56.709> you<00:02:57.040> survive

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
very critical questions if you survive

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.090 
very critical questions if you survive
that<00:02:57.540> and<00:02:58.540> he<00:02:59.110> thought<00:02:59.350> it<00:02:59.530> it<00:02:59.799> was<00:02:59.890> the<00:02:59.980> right

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
that and he thought it it was the right

that and he thought it it was the right
thing<00:03:00.130> to<00:03:00.280> do<00:03:00.459> he<00:03:00.549> said<00:03:00.730> right<00:03:00.910> go<00:03:01.200> when<00:03:02.200> they

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
thing to do he said right go when they

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.390 
thing to do he said right go when they
got<00:03:02.470> together<00:03:03.060> it<00:03:04.060> was<00:03:04.090> this<00:03:04.360> winning

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
got together it was this winning

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.900 
got together it was this winning
objective<00:03:06.400> that<00:03:06.519> was<00:03:06.610> all<00:03:06.700> they<00:03:06.820> were

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
objective that was all they were

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.880 
objective that was all they were
concerned<00:03:07.239> about<00:03:07.360> and<00:03:07.840> hence<00:03:08.530> the<00:03:08.709> ground

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
concerned about and hence the ground

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.949 
concerned about and hence the ground
effects<00:03:09.280> idea<00:03:09.790> came<00:03:10.000> along<00:03:10.239> which<00:03:10.450> really<00:03:10.720> did

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
effects idea came along which really did

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.620 
effects idea came along which really did
dominate<00:03:11.380> Formula<00:03:11.799> One<00:03:11.920> for

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
dominate Formula One for

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.000 
dominate Formula One for
the<00:03:13.620> evolution<00:03:14.310> of<00:03:14.840> ground<00:03:15.840> effects<00:03:16.260> was

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
the evolution of ground effects was

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.010 
the evolution of ground effects was
really<00:03:17.340> beginning<00:03:17.640> to<00:03:17.760> take<00:03:17.880> off<00:03:18.270> in<00:03:18.510> 79

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
really beginning to take off in 79

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.160 
really beginning to take off in 79
nicely<00:03:19.770> I<00:03:20.010> mean<00:03:20.670> on<00:03:20.820> a<00:03:20.850> load<00:03:21.120> of<00:03:21.240> 79<00:03:21.750> which<00:03:21.990> is

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
nicely I mean on a load of 79 which is

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.420 
nicely I mean on a load of 79 which is
in<00:03:22.320> 78<00:03:23.270> that<00:03:24.270> became<00:03:24.900> my<00:03:25.500> favorite<00:03:25.980> car<00:03:26.220> for

in 78 that became my favorite car for

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.430 
in 78 that became my favorite car for
sure<00:03:26.460> and<00:03:27.000> I<00:03:27.150> said<00:03:27.420> because<00:03:29.390> it<00:03:30.390> was<00:03:31.200> right
