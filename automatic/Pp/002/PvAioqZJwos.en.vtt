00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:07.660
 welcome to the villa mata 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.599
 Today we make open tomato fillets 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.790
 in a Mediterranean way on the balance sheets 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:15.370
 beautiful of skin solve one with it 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.560
 balsamic thyme rosemary marinade 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:20.680
 brush in and in the oven 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:23.529
 ca about 20 minutes at 160 degrees completely in 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:26.289
 let the caramelize nicely 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:28.509
 You can eat cold to practice that 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:32.110
 partie can eat warm even in love 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:33.940
 main course calf-like and for you 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.770
 is the unanimous thing and say 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.400
 get started we have the tomatoes 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:42.250
 remove the stunk snow a cross 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:47.290
 unique pattern in the bottom 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:50.170
 but only the skin scoring the stream where 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:53.730
 the stream was there we cut one 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.730
 small circles inside 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:05.500
 Now we give the whole thing to the boiling 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.570
 water before salt water following us 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.399
 want to have the skin off the skin 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.429
 have removed and the distance 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:14.439
 we remove it by putting it all in 

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:16.659
 give boiling water and then in 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:18.999
 ice water quenched as long corners 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:21.850
 water until the first few tips 

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:24.939
 peel here and then we do the whole thing 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.560
 in ice water by the shock of the crime 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:30.219
 nevertheless skin peeled make easy 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:34.210
 ice water as strong water out and 

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:37.030
 Also like a big pinch of salt salt 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:42.219
 is simply the chemical reaction that 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:44.560
 salt and behave like this 

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:46.389
 ice melts through this energy which the 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.399
 it actually needs to be melted 

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:49.600
 temperature again by about 15 degrees - 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:51.490
 and of course we have one more 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.200
 they give greater temperature difference 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:58.319
 simply the tomatoes the boiling water 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:01.319
 in it you need about 10 15 seconds 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:01.319
 just 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:12.650
 when I start paying the first 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:17.300
 solve the problem with the tomatoes so here 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:27.879
 and dissuasive remove and 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:27.879
 then deters the tomato 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:47.930
 wonderfully wonderful peel they see 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:52.459
 it's easy to get rid of him now 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:55.069
 as the tomatoes and core them take 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.620
 We cautiously front and down above and 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:03.140
 cut off the whole thing below 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:05.709
 little pressure so fine filleting so 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.910
 Now that we have the tomatoes a lot 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.880
 finished cleaning in front of us 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:15.579
 beautiful before gutted and go today 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:21.579
 we put the whole in a shell 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:25.280
 tablespoon of honey into it 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:26.510
 not only because we want a 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.400
 let the glaze emerge 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.900
 next to just the spoon in the l fixed 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.829
 we have the firm honey it applies on 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:35.630
 taste most intense in this case 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:38.810
 Now just went the honey in the blue 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:43.040
 water and leave with the hot water 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:46.519
 mixture into the bowl and stir the 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:48.139
 whole village dissolves the hot water 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:51.200
 of course then against the sugar in the honey 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:56.470
 The whole thing becomes a little more fluid if we 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.470
 So far we are somewhat thyme 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:16.220
 as well as rosemary these wear completely 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:17.500
 Fine , we give this in the glaze 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.799
 in 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:28.850
 they like to salt the whole thing 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:38.800
 little pepper pure green the whole 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:38.800
 Nice creamy next to a brush 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:46.070
 The tomatoes we paint the 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:51.490
 have coated nicely strong 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:53.900
 sprinkle like this on the 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.520
 arched shell so no 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:59.990
 liquid can collect up in it 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:02.260
 and learn this evenly through this 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.260
 can 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:10.700
 after seeing like this can see 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:15.460
 the tomatoes from the top with the 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:15.460
 Dab remaining kazur bit 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:26.240
 These in turn salt a very small one 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:31.039
 little and spend at 160 degrees for 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:34.009
 about 20 minutes in the oven so after the 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:36.379
 tomatoes and cooked wonderfully in the oven 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:38.330
 are a light skin have formed 

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:40.430
 you can see it's wonderful 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.080
 caramel the sugar caramelizes it 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:47.330
 gives a wonderful floury 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:50.360
 Taste are now finished and indeed 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.860
