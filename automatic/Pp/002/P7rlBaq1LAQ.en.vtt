00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.719
 Sugarplum 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.070
 personal speech from youtube beauty who whom 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.710
 speaks to Professor David Fagundes to 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.859
 Another class on the channel is to copy and 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:24.810
 today one more radiation lesson, let's go 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:27.510
 speak perfect personal squares one 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.599
 natural number is perfect square 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:34.370
 when it is square of another number 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:37.430
 natural we illustrate here 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:45.500
 Next I want to know the numbers 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:45.500
 perfect squares of zero 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:01:16.610
 so ok then I'll go here 0 1 2 3 4 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:20.220
 5 6 7 8 9 and 10 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:23.400
 Personal what I said about squares 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.220
 perfect a natural number is square 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.680
 perfect when it is square of a 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:34.640
 other natural number 0 is the number 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:42.540
 then the square from 00 to 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:44.000
 square 0 then zero is a square 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:51.590
 Perfect 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:57.570
 now with the square 11 times 11 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:02:01.439
 so it's a perfect square 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:07.860
 Let's get the 2 squared 2 to the 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:13.670
 square is four then 4 is a square 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:19.320
 perfect 3 squared 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:22.110
 three times 39 then nine I can say 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:25.950
 also that it is a perfect square 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:29.610
 so let's get the square of 4th here 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:34.410
 square of 6 square of 6 square 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:43.890
 of 7 the square of 8 the square of 9 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:47.760
 a square of 10 4 squared 1616 is 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:52.470
 a perfect square 5 to five square 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:59.459
 times 5 25 then 25 is a square 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:03:01.830
 perfect 6 squared 36 then 36 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.690
 is also a perfect square notes 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.330
 person who always when the number 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:10.500
 natural square is the square of a 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:17.070
 natural number is a perfect square 7 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:24.780
 to square 4949 a perfect square 8 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:31.290
 squared 64 then 64 squared 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:35.489
 9 perfect to square 8181 is a 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:38.880
 square and 10 squared without 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:44.269
 100 is a perfect square square 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:56.400
 perfect from 0 to 100 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:58.920
 then 10 148 1625 3649 6481 and 100 are the 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:03.030
 perfect squares 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:07.380
 observe one thing by taking all these 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:09.989
 Perfect squares here I'll take one 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.070
 number for example 8 which is a number 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:13.680
 Natural 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:16.739
 he is not a perfect square because he 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:19.709
 does not have any number here that 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:26.390
 multiplied by itself the square 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:26.390
 of this number of eight then 8 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:35.860
 he is not perfect square 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.300
 8 is not a perfect square to be a 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:41.500
 perfect square 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:44.080
 once again remembering to be a 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:47.800
 perfect square has to be the number 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.820
 natural square to be a square 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.420
 Perfect 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:56.410
 Ok guys, we're here in this 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:59.920
 p class you did find out what is right 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:03.280
 are the perfect squares of zero 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:07.170
 So, in the next class, we'll get it. 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:10.570
 number and find out if it is a 

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:12.910
 perfect square personal beauty I hope 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.770
