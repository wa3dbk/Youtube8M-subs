00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
the chart by 16 months very interesting

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.230 
the chart by 16 months very interesting
it<00:02:04.049> shows<00:02:04.350> that<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.770> price<00:02:05.100> trends<00:02:05.610> in<00:02:06.180> the

essentially<00:02:12.860> we've<00:02:13.069> risen<00:02:13.280> at<00:02:13.489> the<00:02:13.580> same<00:02:13.819> rate

essentially we've risen at the same rate

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.660 
essentially we've risen at the same rate
and<00:02:14.360> you<00:02:15.230> would<00:02:15.319> argue<00:02:15.680> we're<00:02:15.980> about<00:02:16.189> to<00:02:16.340> fall

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
and you would argue we're about to fall

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.130 
and you would argue we're about to fall
at<00:02:16.970> the<00:02:17.209> same<00:02:17.239> rate<00:02:17.950> now<00:02:18.950> there's<00:02:19.189> a<00:02:19.280> couple<00:02:19.400> of

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
at the same rate now there's a couple of

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.089 
at the same rate now there's a couple of
implications<00:02:21.140> from<00:02:21.319> this<00:02:21.560> and<00:02:21.739> we'd<00:02:21.829> like<00:02:21.980> to

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
implications from this and we'd like to

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:24.880 
implications from this and we'd like to
