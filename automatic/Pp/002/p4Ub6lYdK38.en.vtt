00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:32.020
 hey I'm the f and today I'm off 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.630
 Watch out for you 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.980
 would like to prepare a small video 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:40.309
 because it is unfortunately not on my property 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.470
 I'm a bit pines there 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.840
 on the way would like a few pine needles 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.570
 do not collect a tea from it 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.090
 i would like to cook 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:54.650
 already tested the are good looking 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:56.630
 The pine needles would like too 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:00.200
 take advantage of the beautiful weather again 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:02.110
 all that beautiful winter next 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:06.190
 week, the temperatures are expected to rise 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.190
 the snow is probably right then 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.550
 I will probably not anymore 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.890
 then come to cook tea 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:18.520
 it's too late for that, what am I doing? 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.520
 then next time 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.390
 So do not be surprised if here 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:27.930
 suddenly everything looks different and the 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:31.920
 Snow is my old quarry 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.920
 and there are a lot of pines 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.530
 for example here 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.360
 ugh 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.090
 look now only a nice job 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.090
 where I go undisturbed 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.980
 yes, that is 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.950
 so are now fully collected the 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:33.430
 is not enough for my theater today 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.280
 create more 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.379
 but the time is running out I am 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.099
 crazy on it and that's why 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:40.720
 I'm sure 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:43.930
 you do not have to wait too long 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.239
 wait as soon as possible to do the video 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.519
 finished but when I'm out there 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:51.849
 I'll show you a few more 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:54.750
 things winter impressions such as 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:54.750
 example, this pine 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:09.000
 I love pine pines are mine 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.560
 absolute favorite films 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.920
 not only because needles with tea 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:18.160
 can make it absolutely because of their 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:21.810
 Ingenious growth in front than any pine 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:25.180
 totally different and unique 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.920
 best of all, it is but look at you 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.380
 a really hot summer day that one 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.360
 kilo gold goes the smell daily 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.390
 emit the essential oils 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:42.310
 that smells so fantastic I can 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:46.930
 not enough other ships 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:49.120
 solvent pine needles one each 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:52.260
 little bit of my pants pocket on the nicely 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.250
 you notice this typical smell 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:59.160
 throw the fucking drugs away 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.160
 by pine needles much better 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.300
 shelter construction and survival is 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.770
 obviously not just for adults 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:40.970
 interesting but also the children 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:48.230
 In any case, the tickle the scaffolding 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:51.890
 be so good as we give now 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:56.110
 on the way home and the part 2 not so 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:56.110
 fast as possible until then 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.789
 Hi 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.889
 it is only a few days later but the 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:25.430
 all snow is gone it is warmer 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:27.889
 become 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.810
 it was raining like crazy 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:32.030
 but still, nonetheless 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.229
 i want to take my tea out of the 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.500
 I make pine needles 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:35.500
 have 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:42.430
 milan spruce needle t even if the me 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:42.430
 here too only the needle 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.530
 I have a decent portion now 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:53.400
 Needed rhine given as I only have to 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:53.400
 wait until it cooks 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:04.680
 it's about time I'm already totally 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:05.640
 I'm excited , I've got it 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.640
 to let something go 

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:11.240
 now has cooled a bit 

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:14.910
 I would test what is better 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:17.390
 pine needles or spruce needles alike 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:17.390
 30 

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:39.370
 clearly the pine needles it better the 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:40.599
 spruce needles are good too but the 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:41.259
 pine needles is a lot more 

00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:45.520
 better 

00:06:41.259 --> 00:06:50.650
 it tastes even more aromatic almost like 

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:52.870
 a real t is unbelievable 

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:57.340
 my own again 

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:58.419
 favorite tree is and remains pine like 

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:00.599
 you have to see me already 

00:06:58.419 --> 00:07:04.060
 artificial do not help 

00:07:00.599 --> 00:07:05.800
 it's getting dark it's getting time 

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.900
 I drink my tea and go home 

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.190
 go 

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:11.490
 thanks for watching until next 

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:11.490
 times 

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:19.230
 a 

00:07:17.569 --> 00:07:24.380
 m 

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:24.380
 now he still has to switch off 

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:38.090
 he says it's very curious anyway 

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:38.090
 nothing more you are still there 

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:44.139
 switch off bush 

00:07:41.729 --> 00:07:45.999
 That's enough 

00:07:44.139 --> 00:07:49.240
 but if he's been there since when 

00:07:45.999 --> 00:07:51.419
 I have to get rid of the tea is 

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:54.150
 that's really good too 

00:07:51.419 --> 00:07:57.150
 but now you have enough information 

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:57.150
 switch off
