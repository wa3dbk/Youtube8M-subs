yeah<00:05:55.080> the<00:05:55.620> actual<00:05:56.190> animal<00:05:56.610> Ares

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:02.380 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:07.760 

primal<00:06:03.380> fight

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:07.770 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:15.469 

and<00:06:09.770> sorry<00:06:13.250> satyr<00:06:14.250> and<00:06:14.370> saw<00:06:14.669> these<00:06:14.940> three<00:06:15.270> ones

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:15.479 
and sorry satyr and saw these three ones

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:17.390 
and sorry satyr and saw these three ones
make<00:06:15.690> a<00:06:15.720> silver<00:06:16.169> because<00:06:16.860> the<00:06:16.889> miracle

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.400 
make a silver because the miracle

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.029 
make a silver because the miracle
doesn't<00:06:17.550> make<00:06:17.849> doesn't<00:06:18.840> connect<00:06:19.169> to<00:06:19.229> Ares

00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:20.039 
doesn't make doesn't connect to Ares

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:21.439 
doesn't make doesn't connect to Ares
that's<00:06:20.250> why<00:06:20.370> but<00:06:20.639> the<00:06:20.729> primal<00:06:21.060> fight<00:06:21.210> does

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:21.449 
that's why but the primal fight does

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:24.559 
that's why but the primal fight does
connect<00:06:21.750> to<00:06:21.870> it<00:06:21.990> and<00:06:22.199> that's<00:06:22.889> why<00:06:23.069> it<00:06:23.879> it<00:06:24.120> makes

00:06:24.559 --> 00:06:24.569 
connect to it and that's why it it makes

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:31.520 
connect to it and that's why it it makes
the<00:06:24.720> silver<00:06:29.330> but<00:06:30.330> okay<00:06:30.870> the<00:06:31.020> next<00:06:31.139> one<00:06:31.289> I'm

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:31.530 
the silver but okay the next one I'm

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:34.100 
the silver but okay the next one I'm
going<00:06:31.740> to<00:06:31.830> use<00:06:32.099> is<00:06:32.310> galleon<00:06:32.759> which<00:06:33.599> is<00:06:33.780> also<00:06:33.960> i

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:34.110 
going to use is galleon which is also i

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:36.830 
going to use is galleon which is also i
can<00:06:34.259> make<00:06:34.500> a<00:06:34.530> silver<00:06:34.919> out<00:06:35.069> of<00:06:35.190> him<00:06:35.340> so<00:06:36.300> silver

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:36.840 
can make a silver out of him so silver

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.629 
can make a silver out of him so silver
would<00:06:37.229> be<00:06:37.729> where's<00:06:38.729> the<00:06:38.909> actual<00:06:39.270> card<00:06:39.479> galleon

would be where's the actual card galleon
then<00:06:41.639> we<00:06:41.880> use<00:06:42.650> vicious<00:06:43.650> battle<00:06:46.520> after<00:06:47.520> that

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:48.530
