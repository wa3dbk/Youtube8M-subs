 geometric for any of these 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:31.800
 reasons the first step is to apply a 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:35.010
 base layer reinforcer to neil experts 3 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:38.280

 wear pro on the entire nail this will be the 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.450
 basis for any of the designs that

 choose polka dots are one more 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.370
 a must for this season 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.260
 Once the base is dry, you only have 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.950
 to download a few drops of enamel 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.050
 on a paper to take the product 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:58.380
 uses a stick the back of 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.390
 a brush or a needle paints the moles 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.910
 about the nails the size that you most 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.210

 will be in your hands for francesita 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.860
 I chose a tone that contrasts with the base 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.619
 and apply it on the tip bordering the nail 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.509
 very carefully it is important that 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.470
 load the brush a lot to achieve a 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.410
 couple texture 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.570
 both colors when you have finished the 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:24.240
 design can clean the cuticles with 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.880
 a swab soaked in neil nail polish remover 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.100
 experts 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.110
 the geometric style is simpler than 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.509
 do what it seems once the 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.220
 base is dry place a tape on the 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.470
 Nail section where you want 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.689
 preserve the base color after 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.450
 applies the enamel of the second neil tone 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:43.549
 webber but about the discovered area 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.250
 let it dry for a minute and remove the tape 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:48.229
 very carefully I chose colors 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:52.569
 contrast and use inverted colors 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:55.340
 for each nail only two more steps are missing 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:57.470
 after making the chosen design apply 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.259
 a protective coating of neil enamel 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.810
 experts 3 in one the same you applied 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.880
 in the first step this way fixed 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.360
 the style so that the mail art lasts longer 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.360
 weather 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.220
 Lastly place kuyt dry oil that dries 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.190
 your nails in 30 seconds and gives a 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.230
 smooth and shiny termination is already 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.269
 Now you can make the combinations of 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:21.370
 colors and shapes that you imagine and better 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:21.370
