 which allows you to navigate class 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.020

 do not end up hurting you can live 

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:15.749
 in the clinic but we have several years 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.279
 we have students leaving the university the Scottish bank after 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:23.480
 Specialization 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.179
 we have many years 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:28.310
 in the area of ​​administration and management 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.990
 the three or even in industrial kitchens which is an area that 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.440
 has an area that has also been growing 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.440
 in which we already have interests in the supply network 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.340
 I could tell true suleiman in the city shoe is a lot 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.840
 since then they are people 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:47.860
 had name 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.980
 there are companies that are supporting 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.580
 further thinking of the part of the event as we compatible 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.450
 words for what 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.110
 - gastronomy contest he is much more equipped 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.770
 equipment 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.230
 both courses as 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.100
 today due to these cities 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.720
 in the next weekend 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.770
 we have networking clinics in chile 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.010
 the part of the functionalism 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.700
 after doing 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.150
 the health part 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.700
 the curricular stages they are responsible for 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.200
 from university 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.590
 and within the effort we have net integrated projects are five 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.280
 home 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.190
 from the start 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.190
 one of the large areas said 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.790
 I say more the completion of course work also in May together 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.050
 the stage is mandatory of impurities 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.390
 three cities in the 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.870
 It's what we call compulsory contemplation. 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.650
 but the match 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.200
 and now with the pedagogical project 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.190
 he starts receiving intermediate certifications from the 3rd semester 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.180
 where could he be faster 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.620
 repeat the same order 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.670
 of some disciplinary measures that are still now invited 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:14.809
 is that he may have more chances of stature 

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:18.719
 he is practically learning his actress niece they like 

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:22.159
 they both like 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:24.389
 the course 

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:26.999
 the practical part is many wings 

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:27.989
 tactics 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.859
 that happens in the different disciplines over the 

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:31.819
 thereby 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.349
 They really like the stadiums. 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.719
 however if they did not realize 

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:39.479
 which area do they have majority 

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:41.079
 several times than they 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:43.249
 vianna terrorism 

00:02:43.249 --> 00:02:46.369
 not exactly what they expected 

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:48.709
 we have many years everything changed his mind 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:49.999
 on the last year 

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:51.469
 and can perceive 

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:54.499
 new consciousness 

00:02:54.499 --> 00:02:56.139
 another of the possibilities 

00:02:56.139 --> 00:03:00.620
 for many centuries he can do this, I do not want to continue doing it 

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:02.009
 what has already been done 

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:05.179
 but there is even more creative sampaense 

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:07.170
 and doing so has a lot of ambition 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.919
 that is the purpose 

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:10.399
 also interested 

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:13.689
 we twisted several names 

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:15.799
 Apparently farm 3 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:17.289
 began to be made 

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:21.149
 it is impression so we did not have for example genetics 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.410
 the future of nutrition must be sad 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.759
 monkey 17 genetics 

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:30.339
 very few people are the manager of idc and we are looking for 

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:33.569
 not enough they become 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:34.669
 the world today 

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:37.609
 He's also going to help us in the future. 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:40.249
 to work better participate 

00:03:40.249 --> 00:03:41.339
 the inquisition as 

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:42.689
 keep talking about 

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:44.699
 this justification 

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:47.069
 angie had before 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:48.929
 another differential we do not know 

00:03:48.929 --> 00:03:52.899
 it is a space in the course that the saulo print exercise part 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.549
 in it being a single artist version is a big joke 

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:00.859
 have very few people working with sports sciences 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:02.669
 exercise and health 

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:03.880
 is an area that has d 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:04.879
 so much to be done 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:08.890
 the talent and quality of life and now she has a space especially 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:12.039
 to make the scene 

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:14.019
 logical that allowed it by hand 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:16.309
 is a minimum requirement 

00:04:16.309 --> 00:04:19.719
 in the extension projects together with the 

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:22.370
 for who else has the mania that most pay 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:23.460
 to experience 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.599
 is piloted by percent in September 

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:27.490
 too much 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.050
 is once again the student 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.199
 nobody told me anything 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:32.680
 of the essay 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.759
 elineide cento are very sure 

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:37.379
 That's why he's going to hug. 

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:38.410
 click here 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.639
 part of health costs 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:44.449
 there is a basis that counts 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:47.449
 now the dispute 

00:04:49.309 --> 00:04:51.650
 the minister so we understand 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.699
 a theme that we develop 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:55.759
 talks about the area of ​​activity 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:59.900
 is a lot of people imagine that he must have read something in that year 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.770
 we will also go from traditional themes to the different areas of 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.469
 performance that will speak a little bit 

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:06.979
 what are they doing 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:09.000
 we really do have 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.960
 the first time contest 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.599
 so far it makes sense 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:15.719
 You really are 

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:18.550
 in a third incident 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.550
 and he is more sure indeed 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:26.490
 We're still trying to be born. 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.889
 the modality but we usually say 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:31.889
 khelil said iniesta lr a educator yes 

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:35.270
 independent of wealth 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.270
 it will be like this 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:41.949
 he is 

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:44.949
 he has to go 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:49.919
 he should like to study because conscience 

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:53.439
 with many possibilities that we say today 

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:56.969
 tomorrow is no longer proved 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:05:58.439
 the head 

00:05:58.439 --> 00:06:00.389
 a planet 

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:01.669
 end of last year 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:02.979
 the federal council 

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:06.699
 It is low a concierge allowing the news not even write what 

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:07.800
 want to 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.050
 in this sense 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.760
 erika people are putting up 

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.909
 the elective discipline curriculum 

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:15.900
 is that it can update itself after 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.800
 every document 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.909
 new things will emerge, but we have created this strategy in the sense that 

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:23.849
 however the 60 countries 

00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:26.849
 his party affiliations are currently offered 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.370
 this type of sound pressure 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:31.270
 in case of disability
