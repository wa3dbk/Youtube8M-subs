results<00:02:27.280> I<00:02:27.820> mean<00:02:28.570> real<00:02:29.440> life<00:02:29.920> changing<00:02:30.610> oh<00:02:30.820> I

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
results I mean real life changing oh I

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.640 
results I mean real life changing oh I
can<00:02:31.360> look<00:02:31.510> in<00:02:31.660> the<00:02:31.780> mirror<00:02:32.140> and<00:02:32.320> see<00:02:32.500> the

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
can look in the mirror and see the

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.750 
can look in the mirror and see the
difference<00:02:33.100> in<00:02:33.280> me<00:02:33.630> results<00:02:34.630> and<00:02:34.750> I<00:02:35.760> guess

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
difference in me results and I guess

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.530 
difference in me results and I guess
it's<00:02:36.970> the<00:02:37.090> same<00:02:37.330> thing<00:02:37.600> with<00:02:37.750> p90x<00:02:38.490> so<00:02:39.540> instead

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
it's the same thing with p90x so instead

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.570 
it's the same thing with p90x so instead
of<00:02:40.600> telling<00:02:40.870> myself<00:02:41.200> that<00:02:41.560> I'm<00:02:41.830> scared<00:02:42.250> of
