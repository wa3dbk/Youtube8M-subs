 this time our curious hands 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.149
 a device that has long deserved 

00:00:21.149 --> 00:00:23.269
 recognition of the SRs we call him for sure 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:25.779
 the rotor cannot be one of the most 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:28.130

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:33.760
 this device we did with a special 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.460
 food since the device 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.519
 really inspires a feeling 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:39.180

 jeep first version 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.079
 appearance is simple and practical but at the same 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.850
 time is quite pleasant which allows 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.409
 install the rotor and a visible housing 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:39.490
 made in horizontal 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.579

 on the wall of power practical matt 

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:44.999
 however if the device is hidden 

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:46.840
 under the table this factor does not matter 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.659
 the body is pretty impressive that 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:49.530
 quite logical considering 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.939
 the manufacturer has stuffing and 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:52.890
 necessary for cooling 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.439

 devices can send them 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.120
 practically in any direction and position 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.340
 as needed for better network coverage 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.340
 Wi-Fi 

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:46.989
 one of the best for today big mouth 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.419
 arafat asus undoubtedly has a wide 

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:51.209
 functional and more than enough for 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:52.369
 this performance 

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:54.839
 it is worth mentioning support to three hundred 

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:56.949
 thousand at the same time the entire network and many all 

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:57.950
 it becomes clear 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.170
 and this opportunity is just characterizing 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:01.640
 performance by value by 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.379
 order surpasses simpler models 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:04.819
 routers all thanks to 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:06.879
 filling manufacturer who 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:08.900
 appearance so 16 over a year ago 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.920
 became almost unprecedented with 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.580
 performance so sixteen 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.390
