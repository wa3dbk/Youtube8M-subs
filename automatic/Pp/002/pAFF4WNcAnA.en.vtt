00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:32.780
 old and I retire the excess and now I'm going 

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:32.780

 give her think about the mirror of this golden 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:51.689

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:14.790
 and now without cleaning the brush I will 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:16.890
 get a little bit of silver and I'm going to 

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:20.130
 give it but this dish I'm going to give 

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:22.500
 very very very very very superficially go 

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:25.560
 to do just taps so they see how 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:28.290
 you are seeing this I do not want 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:31.340
 It looks a lot and that's why I'm going to give it 

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:31.340
 well just a little bit 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:37.650

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:43.050
 What we are going to do is give one or two 

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:46.080
 layers of acrylic varnish we're going to give it 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:48.960

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.680

00:07:03.569 --> 00:07:08.419
 the very long stems you can 

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:11.939
 also put natural flowers because 

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:14.819
 As it is plastic inside it is not going 

00:07:11.939 --> 00:07:17.399
 to damage is not not covered with paper 

00:07:14.819 --> 00:07:20.110

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:25.540
 It is also simple economical and easy to 

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:27.910
