00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:13.700
 Hi, today I'm going to do a tutorial 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:16.760
 how to make covers in the hair but without 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:19.310
 without heat I do not know if it happens to you but now 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.490
 starting to come good weather to me 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.949
 the plates give me a terrible heat and 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.980
 I was overwhelmed and finished by not for not 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:29.810
 do nothing to me so good was 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.820
 looking on the internet I've seen a couple of 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:38.000
 ways to 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:40.879
 to be able to do the curls without heat and I'm going 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.800
 to show you one of the ways to 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:46.040
 start you will need a rubber band 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.890
 elastic can already be a headband that 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.150
 carry some ornament or of these that only 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:54.570
 They carry 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:57.320
 elastic in one in one of the two parts 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.500
 I'm going to take this and it's just 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.500
 ask you the 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:06.540
 head 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.540
 and tie a knot 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.200
 simple 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.490
 OK 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.570
 Let's see 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.570
 first we will look 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.690
 where we want to put the line that is 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.680
 more or less 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:34.860
 well defined and 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:38.530
 I'm going to get good, I have how can you 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.900
 see very wet hair 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.659
 either dried a bit by the part of 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:46.430
 down here but most are wet 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:49.250
 I take the 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:53.480
 to be a fluid that is very good for me 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:56.050
 the tips to hydrate it so it does not 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.050
 curl 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:04.189
 this part is also sites and I 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:06.700
 you do with plates you have protection 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:06.700
 thermal 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:23.020
 Well what we have to do is 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.020
 put on our our little band 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.060
 A) Yes 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.060
 and we start by taking 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.510
 a lock 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:47.200
 and we had it 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.200
 inside the band we take it 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.520
 another method 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:03:00.430
 we had it and so we are doing with everything 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.430
 with all the hair 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.210
 and with the other side 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:28.580
 the band 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.580
 and we had it 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:51.060
 if we wanted , we could also 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:53.440
 so leave miseries and a hairstyle type 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.800
 romantic that remains that is very nice 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:59.790
 or all for inside 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.790
 we go back to this side 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:54.100
 and we're going to screw everything until we 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.100
 everything is collected 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.900
 as you have seen the back 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:23.190
 we are screwing well 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.190
 to make it right 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:26.500
 all good 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:32.639
 has a threading in the area we could 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:35.129
 leave them like this 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:37.870
 if you like 

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:41.820
 a hairstyle like that 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.820
 old decorate it with some 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:47.600
 with some hairpin also if we 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:52.040
 let's leave like this I would recommend putting 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:52.040
 hairpins here for 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:59.900
 so that it will hold better and good one 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.670
 Once we have everything collected then if you 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.410
 you do it at night you go to sleep and 

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:05.690
 In the morning, she undoes it and if you do not 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:09.650
 you wait a while until you notice that everything 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:11.779
 the hair is dry and then you will see how 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:15.389
 as the mud is made 

00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:18.719
 but it's like that if you like it you could go to 

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:21.240
 work and then go back and undo 

00:06:18.719 --> 00:06:24.029
 wolves would be the curls as more os 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:28.229
 like it I 'll be back in a little while 

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:32.430
 Well, I have dry hair. 

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:34.580
 about four hours and I'm going to retire 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.580
 the 

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:38.140
 we remove the rubber 

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:08.790
 the truth I still have it a little bit 

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:08.790
 little humid but as you can see it takes 

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:14.979
 and welcomes form 

00:07:12.139 --> 00:07:14.979
 and in 

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:23.069
 I do not know, I like it 

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:26.249
 this one that remains if you want there is a 

00:07:23.069 --> 00:07:29.760
 little more disheveled the 

00:07:26.249 --> 00:07:31.600
 it looks a little like curls 

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:35.050
 and it is already 

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:39.340
 Well I hope you liked it and you see 

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:43.210
 which is very easy and if you have 

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:45.160
 The shorter hair is made the same if 

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:49.900
 He has not put up with you before with some 

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:52.690
 hairpins and that's it and it's good 

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:56.529
