00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.429 
the effectiveness of the paint will not
be<00:01:41.369> lowered<00:01:42.360> by<00:01:42.570> going<00:01:42.869> in<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.140> out<00:01:43.170> of<00:01:43.350> the

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
be lowered by going in and out of the

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.350 
be lowered by going in and out of the
water<00:01:43.649> as<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.130> would<00:01:44.310> be<00:01:44.520> with<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.700> traditional

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
water as it would be with a traditional

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.810 
water as it would be with a traditional
hard<00:01:45.570> paint<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.770> third<00:01:46.979> factor<00:01:47.460> is<00:01:47.610> it

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
hard paint and the third factor is it

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.850 
hard paint and the third factor is it
still<00:01:48.270> gives<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.659> good<00:01:48.840> performance<00:01:49.500> over

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
still gives you a good performance over

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.340 
still gives you a good performance over
time<00:01:49.909> so<00:01:50.909> what<00:01:51.479> we're<00:01:51.630> gonna<00:01:51.689> do<00:01:51.960> is<00:01:52.110> start

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
time so what we're gonna do is start

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.620 
time so what we're gonna do is start
with<00:01:52.470> 80<00:01:52.649> grit<00:01:52.740> sandpaper<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.729> starts<00:01:54.509> to

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
with 80 grit sandpaper and starts to

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.359 
with 80 grit sandpaper and starts to
smooth<00:01:54.869> this<00:01:55.049> surface<00:01:55.439> out<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:55.860> then<00:01:56.219> we'll

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
smooth this surface out and then we'll

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.740 
smooth this surface out and then we'll
build<00:01:56.549> it<00:01:56.729> up<00:01:56.820> with<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:57.030> new<00:01:57.240> antifouling<00:01:57.689> paint

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
build it up with a new antifouling paint

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.900 
build it up with a new antifouling paint
before<00:01:59.440> we<00:01:59.560> begin<00:01:59.860> sanding<00:02:00.190> we<00:02:00.640> carefully

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:00.910 
before we begin sanding we carefully

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.840 
before we begin sanding we carefully
taped<00:02:01.360> the<00:02:01.570> boats<00:02:01.780> waterline<00:02:02.640> sanding<00:02:03.640> should

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
taped the boats waterline sanding should

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.330 
taped the boats waterline sanding should
be<00:02:03.940> done<00:02:04.180> with<00:02:04.510> a<00:02:04.540> slow<00:02:04.990> orbital<00:02:05.650> sander<00:02:06.130> for

be done with a slow orbital sander for
optimum<00:02:07.210> control<00:02:08.520> imperfections<00:02:09.520> are<00:02:09.729> filled

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
optimum control imperfections are filled

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.420 
optimum control imperfections are filled
in<00:02:10.119> with<00:02:10.180> a<00:02:10.360> two-part<00:02:10.930> fairing<00:02:11.350> compound<00:02:11.830> it

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
in with a two-part fairing compound it

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.850 
in with a two-part fairing compound it
will<00:02:12.610> cure<00:02:12.910> in<00:02:13.030> a<00:02:13.120> few<00:02:13.420> hours<00:02:13.450> after<00:02:14.260> which<00:02:14.680> it

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
will cure in a few hours after which it

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.060 
will cure in a few hours after which it
can<00:02:15.070> be<00:02:15.100> sanded<00:02:16.110> we<00:02:17.110> then<00:02:17.290> apply<00:02:17.590> our<00:02:17.620> first

walking around the yard inspecting some

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.240 
walking around the yard inspecting some
of<00:02:34.360> these<00:02:34.480> other<00:02:34.690> vessels<00:02:35.200> let's<00:02:35.860> join<00:02:36.130> him

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
of these other vessels let's join him

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.199 
of these other vessels let's join him
and<00:02:36.400> see<00:02:36.520> what<00:02:36.640> he<00:02:36.700> found

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
and see what he found

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.480 
and see what he found
and<00:02:37.600> we're<00:02:37.690> looking<00:02:37.930> at<00:02:38.050> a<00:02:38.080> Donzi<00:02:39.040> go<00:02:39.190> fast

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
and we're looking at a Donzi go fast

and we're looking at a Donzi go fast
this<00:02:40.000> gentleman<00:02:40.720> probably<00:02:40.870> drive<00:02:41.380> stores<00:02:41.709> his

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
this gentleman probably drive stores his

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.670 
this gentleman probably drive stores his
boat<00:02:42.160> I<00:02:42.310> was<00:02:42.459> just<00:02:42.610> gonna<00:02:42.700> say<00:02:42.970> that<00:02:43.680> probably

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
boat I was just gonna say that probably

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.350 
boat I was just gonna say that probably
takes<00:02:44.890> it<00:02:45.040> out<00:02:45.130> of<00:02:45.190> the<00:02:45.280> water<00:02:45.400> every<00:02:45.640> day<00:02:45.790> yeah

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
takes it out of the water every day yeah

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.260 
takes it out of the water every day yeah
so<00:02:46.840> if<00:02:47.410> you<00:02:47.560> don't<00:02:47.740> have<00:02:47.860> that<00:02:48.010> option<00:02:48.270> you

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
so if you don't have that option you

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:50.940 
so if you don't have that option you
basically<00:02:49.720> have<00:02:50.020> to<00:02:50.260> have<00:02:50.290> some<00:02:50.650> sort<00:02:50.890> of

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
basically have to have some sort of

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.680 
basically have to have some sort of
bottom<00:02:51.280> paint<00:02:51.490> on<00:02:51.610> there<00:02:51.850> or<00:02:52.330> else<00:02:52.540> you're

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
bottom paint on there or else you're

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.690 
bottom paint on there or else you're
gonna<00:02:52.750> be<00:02:52.870> wiping<00:02:53.350> it<00:02:53.440> almost<00:02:53.680> every<00:02:54.070> day<00:02:54.100> is

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
gonna be wiping it almost every day is

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.520 
gonna be wiping it almost every day is
there<00:02:55.090> such<00:02:55.270> a<00:02:55.300> thing<00:02:55.420> as<00:02:55.810> a<00:02:55.840> kind<00:02:56.470> of

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
there such a thing as a kind of

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.050 
there such a thing as a kind of
combination<00:02:56.910> ablative<00:02:57.910> hard<00:02:58.600> bottom<00:02:59.290> paint

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
combination ablative hard bottom paint

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.850 
combination ablative hard bottom paint
application<00:03:01.060> well<00:03:01.660> yes<00:03:02.080> it<00:03:02.320> is<00:03:02.350> I<00:03:02.709> mean

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
application well yes it is I mean

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.729 
application well yes it is I mean
sometimes<00:03:03.100> we<00:03:03.910> use<00:03:04.120> a<00:03:04.150> hard<00:03:04.630> across<00:03:05.500> the

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
sometimes we use a hard across the

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.070 
sometimes we use a hard across the
bottom<00:03:05.980> and<00:03:06.489> an<00:03:06.940> ablative<00:03:07.300> on<00:03:07.600> the<00:03:07.750> waterline

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
bottom and an ablative on the waterline

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.259 
bottom and an ablative on the waterline
because<00:03:08.769> the<00:03:08.980> waterline<00:03:09.489> tends<00:03:09.790> to<00:03:09.970> be<00:03:10.090> much

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
because the waterline tends to be much

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.390 
because the waterline tends to be much
more<00:03:10.480> susceptible<00:03:10.900> to<00:03:11.260> getting<00:03:11.440> grass<00:03:12.010> growth

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
more susceptible to getting grass growth

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.220 
more susceptible to getting grass growth
right<00:03:13.030> oh<00:03:13.060> you<00:03:13.239> use<00:03:13.480> the<00:03:13.630> ablative<00:03:14.019> at<00:03:14.110> the

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
right oh you use the ablative at the

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.840 
right oh you use the ablative at the
waterline<00:03:14.530> and<00:03:14.800> that<00:03:14.980> wears<00:03:15.190> off<00:03:15.459> a<00:03:15.519> little

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
waterline and that wears off a little

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.000 
waterline and that wears off a little
faster<00:03:16.269> and<00:03:16.420> gives<00:03:16.630> your<00:03:16.780> boat<00:03:17.050> cleaner<00:03:17.380> but

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
faster and gives your boat cleaner but

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.740 
faster and gives your boat cleaner but
you<00:03:18.100> had<00:03:18.280> the<00:03:18.519> hard<00:03:18.760> paint<00:03:19.060> on<00:03:19.269> the<00:03:19.450> underneath

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
you had the hard paint on the underneath

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.960 
you had the hard paint on the underneath
which<00:03:20.560> really<00:03:20.920> is<00:03:21.220> where<00:03:21.400> a<00:03:21.430> lot<00:03:21.700> of<00:03:21.730> the

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
which really is where a lot of the

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.210 
which really is where a lot of the
pounding<00:03:22.570> is<00:03:22.720> coming<00:03:23.110> from<00:03:23.290> your<00:03:23.470> baggage<00:03:23.950> and

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
pounding is coming from your baggage and
