00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:12.629
 New York is a fantastic city one 

00:00:10.499 --> 00:00:15.450
 madhouse all day chaos 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:17.730
 fourth time it snapped out of here and it 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.710
 remains an experience every time 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.349
 I am now many fifth for the French 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.570
 times in new york and every time i have 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:26.220
 just really need a day to insist 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.130
 from the city 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.109
 I can every 5 you see it just 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.390
 otherwise again what is the state is theo 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.260
 tame in development and yes so any 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.260
 another experience 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.340
 the fact that I am with my brother in martin 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.350
 the orchestra is unique 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.180
 sometimes the big advantage is immediately 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.240
 a drawback that is that each other through and through 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.860
 by knowing and that makes it in the 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.900
 very easy to practice together 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:15.020
 We know each other exactly 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:18.130
 we feel room very well and 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.920
 Occasionally it is sometimes difficult 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.320
 maud works differently with each other 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.480
 as with a colleague 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.310
 you 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.140
 says some things 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.630
 easier against each other you take one 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.730
 easy politics and once you 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.050
 have enough of each other then it is 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:37.020
 good again next day is actually the 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.820
 only colleague that I sometimes catch on with 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.940
 because it's my brother's typical want 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.380
 it sometimes happen that i give stupid 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:46.980
 and I am the oldest so I owe parents 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.630
 but I would like you to 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.310

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.580

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.440

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.020
