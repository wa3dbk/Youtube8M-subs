00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:04.260
 i 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.670
 We are here in Miraflores on July 28 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.200
 in the meadow house until June 22 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.960
 to present a fair that is the 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.790
 requested expo of ccoo that I made of a 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.220
 international design salon that 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:27.050
 our proposed object architecture 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.690
 of piece design proposals 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.850
 artists architects of the estuary 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.080
 interiorism good many things and 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.580
 to start these tours I'm going to 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.330
 present to lisette de marcia with the 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.330
 paita's proposal 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.969
 with the gas issue and not necessarily 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:52.539
 in this proposal because they have a 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:53.980
 work to do as green walls very 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:56.680
 natural do not we on those walls 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:59.320
 worked vertically necessarily 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.420
 but to do is this green box 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.269
 back good we have tried to 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.610
 arm like two terraces and like this 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.470
 has a fund and this fair is for 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.560
 architects lima designers everything is 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.960
 growing up almost the majority of 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.360
 people no longer have tiered gardens 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.330
 then you can be in a super 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.190
 garden in a cute green space 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:25.319
 wonderful where all this area here 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.319
 back can be pure planters 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.409
 is another proposal that have been worked 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.060
 of reason a lonely to read the 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.920
 book 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.630
 It is a proposal of a terrace well 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.880
 I remove small for that also 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.720
 in a tiny terrace you can have 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.720
 a super nice atmosphere 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.329
 respect good taste of the city though 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:51.329
 we told you 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.680
 one of the environments that we are going to see 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.630
 now it is the restaurant's enter 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.790
 a gourmet concept that handles a whole 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.500
 concept of areas regions of 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.509
 Peru and for this three have come together 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.189
 architects that are carlos bruno and román 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.189
 and let us know so that people 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.739
 first to understand the concept that 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.550
 are our regions in the 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:26.830
 architecture I think of the transactions 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.230
 good the concept a bit the idea came up 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.930
 seeing a little the letter presented by 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.270
 the chef who is radio solórzano del medio 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.240
 groove in ingredients of the three 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:40.000
 regions a little the dishes will be with 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.590
 more the host the regional ones and that was 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.960
 point was a bit of the starting point 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.920
 moored with the spaces of this 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.920
 ambient 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.700
 is the space that represents a bit of 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.280
 home of the saw in conceptual way 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.220
 as i tell you problems i think 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.800
 simplifying a bit 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.340
 we have this wall that is hiding 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.650
 some rails that lived 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:10.810
 work with fiber blog trans elemental 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.810
 expanded represented 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:23.870
 the dining room the bar we are also 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:27.050
 we work on the subject of sodas this is 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:31.000
 much more organic is recreated a little 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.000
 I want to be flying
