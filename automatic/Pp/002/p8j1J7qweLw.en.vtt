really a Grateful warning of a larger

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.380 
really a Grateful warning of a larger
news<00:02:37.629> story<00:02:37.959> or<00:02:38.910> conversely<00:02:39.910> there's<00:02:40.120> kind<00:02:40.360> of

news story or conversely there's kind of

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:41.550 
news story or conversely there's kind of
always<00:02:40.690> going<00:02:40.810> to<00:02:40.840> be<00:02:40.900> situations<00:02:41.440> where

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
always going to be situations where

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.780 
always going to be situations where
you're<00:02:42.489> seeing<00:02:44.579> erroneous<00:02:45.579> information

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
you're seeing erroneous information

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.500 
you're seeing erroneous information
going<00:02:46.599> out<00:02:46.870> there<00:02:47.170> and<00:02:47.970> so<00:02:48.970> a<00:02:49.000> lot<00:02:49.329> of<00:02:49.359> it

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
going out there and so a lot of it

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.500 
going out there and so a lot of it
really<00:02:49.750> does<00:02:49.930> come<00:02:50.140> back<00:02:50.290> to<00:02:50.319> confirmation

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
really does come back to confirmation

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.990 
really does come back to confirmation
but<00:02:52.510> and<00:02:53.440> I<00:02:53.500> think<00:02:53.799> that<00:02:54.220> confirmation<00:02:54.910> that

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
but and I think that confirmation that

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.699 
but and I think that confirmation that
needs<00:02:55.239> to<00:02:55.420> come<00:02:55.629> and<00:02:55.989> you<00:02:56.200> need<00:02:56.349> to<00:02:56.500> vet

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
needs to come and you need to vet

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.190 
needs to come and you need to vet
whatever<00:02:57.040> you<00:02:57.190> hear<00:02:57.489> before<00:02:58.329> you<00:02:58.629> react<00:02:58.959> to<00:02:59.170> it

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
whatever you hear before you react to it

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.990 
whatever you hear before you react to it
through<00:02:59.859> it<00:02:59.980> as<00:03:00.099> many<00:03:00.250> different<00:03:00.459> sources<00:03:00.760> as

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
through it as many different sources as

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.309 
through it as many different sources as
you<00:03:01.030> can<00:03:01.329> I<00:03:01.359> think<00:03:01.510> there's<00:03:01.840> a<00:03:01.930> great<00:03:02.109> deal<00:03:02.230> of

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 
you can I think there's a great deal of

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:04.890 
you can I think there's a great deal of
importance<00:03:02.709> than<00:03:02.799> that<00:03:02.950> and<00:03:03.430> that<00:03:04.299> sometimes

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
importance than that and that sometimes

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.750 
importance than that and that sometimes
be<00:03:05.170> handled<00:03:05.410> through<00:03:05.470> social<00:03:05.799> media<00:03:05.829> more

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
be handled through social media more

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.550 
be handled through social media more
often<00:03:07.060> than<00:03:07.180> not<00:03:07.209> for<00:03:07.720> the<00:03:07.930> way<00:03:08.019> I<00:03:08.049> would<00:03:08.319> tend

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
often than not for the way I would tend

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.710 
often than not for the way I would tend
to<00:03:08.620> use<00:03:08.859> it<00:03:09.040> an<00:03:09.250> organization<00:03:10.239> tends<00:03:10.450> to<00:03:10.599> use

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
to use it an organization tends to use

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.479 
to use it an organization tends to use
it<00:03:10.870> that<00:03:11.440> confirmation<00:03:11.799> everything<00:03:12.280> needs<00:03:12.459> to

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
it that confirmation everything needs to

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.849 
it that confirmation everything needs to
come<00:03:12.549> through<00:03:13.150> a<00:03:13.419> lot<00:03:14.019> of<00:03:14.049> our<00:03:14.260> own<00:03:14.349> official

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:14.859 
come through a lot of our own official

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:17.970 
come through a lot of our own official
internal<00:03:15.220> communications<00:03:16.650> but<00:03:17.650> there's

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
internal communications but there's

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.650 
internal communications but there's
certainly<00:03:18.340> a<00:03:18.639> great<00:03:18.970> deal<00:03:19.120> of<00:03:19.209> utility<00:03:19.630> in

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
certainly a great deal of utility in

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.319 
certainly a great deal of utility in
scene<00:03:20.319> themes<00:03:20.709> arise<00:03:21.130> and<00:03:21.549> saying<00:03:21.790> alright

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
were and I saw this community kind of

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.500 
were and I saw this community kind of
build<00:05:04.260> up<00:05:04.410> around<00:05:04.590> that<00:05:05.300> starting<00:05:06.300> to<00:05:06.360> build

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
build up around that starting to build

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.240 
build up around that starting to build
and<00:05:06.780> people<00:05:06.990> were<00:05:07.080> we're<00:05:07.650> giving<00:05:07.919> this<00:05:08.040> person

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
and people were we're giving this person

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.130 
and people were we're giving this person
suggestions<00:05:08.940> of<00:05:09.090> how<00:05:09.240> to<00:05:09.300> get<00:05:09.480> around<00:05:09.630> it<00:05:09.960> I

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:10.140 
suggestions of how to get around it I

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:11.960 
suggestions of how to get around it I
guess<00:05:10.680> it's<00:05:10.860> a<00:05:10.919> common<00:05:11.250> occurrence<00:05:11.490> for<00:05:11.760> a<00:05:11.820> lot

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
guess it's a common occurrence for a lot

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.960 
guess it's a common occurrence for a lot
of<00:05:12.090> other<00:05:12.210> airlines<00:05:12.980> that<00:05:13.980> this<00:05:14.250> is<00:05:14.430> a<00:05:14.460> policy

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
of other airlines that this is a policy

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.210 
of other airlines that this is a policy
that's<00:05:15.150> kind<00:05:15.419> of<00:05:15.510> overlooked<00:05:16.020> and<00:05:16.860> so<00:05:17.070> people

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
that's kind of overlooked and so people

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.730 
that's kind of overlooked and so people
were<00:05:17.370> saying<00:05:17.610> oh<00:05:17.910> you're<00:05:18.120> supposed<00:05:18.419> to<00:05:18.740> tell
