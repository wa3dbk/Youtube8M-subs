honest there's a few times where I found
his<00:02:17.370> brother<00:02:17.520> to<00:02:17.849> be<00:02:18.090> pretty<00:02:18.750> annoying<00:02:19.080> and

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
his brother to be pretty annoying and

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.410 
his brother to be pretty annoying and

from<00:03:37.049> this<00:03:37.260> and<00:03:37.469> I<00:03:37.500> think<00:03:37.799> parents<00:03:38.400> would<00:03:39.000> be

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
from this and I think parents would be

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.059 
from this and I think parents would be
satisfied<00:03:39.750> like<00:03:39.989> maybe<00:03:40.260> parents<00:03:40.709> will<00:03:40.889> have

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
satisfied like maybe parents will have

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:44.149 
satisfied like maybe parents will have
kids<00:03:41.400> that<00:03:41.849> are<00:03:42.599> fighting<00:03:42.989> like<00:03:43.979> they're

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:44.159 
kids that are fighting like they're

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:45.559 
kids that are fighting like they're
telling<00:03:44.400> each<00:03:44.489> other<00:03:44.669> oh<00:03:44.759> I<00:03:44.939> wish<00:03:45.239> you<00:03:45.359> never

telling each other oh I wish you never
existed<00:03:45.720> I<00:03:46.229> wish<00:03:46.470> you<00:03:46.709> never<00:03:46.979> existed

existed I wish you never existed

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:49.969 
existed I wish you never existed
maybe<00:03:48.180> if<00:03:48.509> that's<00:03:48.750> happening<00:03:49.290> parents<00:03:49.859> would

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:49.979 
maybe if that's happening parents would

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:52.969 
maybe if that's happening parents would
show<00:03:50.220> kids<00:03:50.549> this<00:03:50.819> special<00:03:51.540> and<00:03:51.810> the<00:03:52.439> kids<00:03:52.709> can

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:52.979 
show kids this special and the kids can

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:54.349

heart<00:04:21.449> way<00:04:22.109> more<00:04:22.440> heart<00:04:22.740> than<00:04:22.800> the<00:04:22.949> original

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
heart way more heart than the original

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.999 
heart way more heart than the original
my<00:04:23.520> opinion<00:04:23.849> because<00:04:24.690> in<00:04:24.840> the<00:04:24.960> original<00:04:25.650> the

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:26.009 
my opinion because in the original the

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:28.670 
my opinion because in the original the
heart<00:04:26.340> felt<00:04:26.699> a<00:04:26.940> little<00:04:27.120> rushed<00:04:27.539> to<00:04:27.719> me<00:04:27.870> but<00:04:28.440> in

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
heart felt a little rushed to me but in

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.230 
heart felt a little rushed to me but in
this<00:04:29.009> special<00:04:29.789> I<00:04:30.060> was<00:04:30.659> actually<00:04:30.960> able<00:04:31.639> to<00:04:32.639> feel

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
this special I was actually able to feel

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.689 
this special I was actually able to feel
the<00:04:33.930> touching<00:04:34.590> heartwarming<00:04:35.280> moments

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:35.699 
the touching heartwarming moments

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:38.120 
the touching heartwarming moments
because<00:04:36.300> the<00:04:36.449> pacing<00:04:37.020> and<00:04:37.139> the<00:04:37.229> sequel<00:04:37.889> is

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
because the pacing and the sequel is

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.870 
because the pacing and the sequel is
actually<00:04:39.090> a<00:04:39.120> whole<00:04:39.599> lot<00:04:39.870> better<00:04:40.190> than<00:04:41.190> the

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
actually a whole lot better than the

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.719 
actually a whole lot better than the
original<00:04:42.590> even<00:04:43.590> though<00:04:43.710> this<00:04:43.860> is<00:04:44.039> 30<00:04:44.310> minutes

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:44.729 
original even though this is 30 minutes

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:47.600 
original even though this is 30 minutes
like<00:04:44.909> the<00:04:45.030> original<00:04:45.659> the<00:04:46.050> pacing<00:04:46.770> is<00:04:46.800> actually

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
like the original the pacing is actually

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.869 
like the original the pacing is actually
really<00:04:48.090> smooth<00:04:48.690> it<00:04:48.960> doesn't<00:04:49.830> feel<00:04:50.010> rushed

00:04:50.869 --> 00:04:50.879 
really smooth it doesn't feel rushed

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:52.999 
really smooth it doesn't feel rushed
maybe<00:04:51.209> towards<00:04:51.749> the<00:04:51.839> end<00:04:52.050> when<00:04:52.619> a<00:04:52.649> little

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:53.009 
maybe towards the end when a little

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:54.889 
maybe towards the end when a little
something<00:04:53.399> happens<00:04:54.029> it<00:04:54.270> does<00:04:54.479> feel<00:04:54.779> a<00:04:54.809> little

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:54.899 
something happens it does feel a little

00:04:54.899 --> 00:04:57.379 
something happens it does feel a little
rushed<00:04:55.379> but<00:04:56.099> not<00:04:56.459> compared<00:04:56.969> to<00:04:57.029> how<00:04:57.330> the

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:57.389 
rushed but not compared to how the

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:00.260 
rushed but not compared to how the
original<00:04:57.749> is<00:04:58.229> the<00:04:59.009> pacing<00:04:59.459> for<00:04:59.639> the<00:04:59.699> most<00:04:59.909> part

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
original is the pacing for the most part

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.040 
original is the pacing for the most part
it's<00:05:00.569> really<00:05:01.439> smooth<00:05:01.860> and<00:05:02.279> it's<00:05:03.029> just<00:05:03.330> so<00:05:03.749> well

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
it's really smooth and it's just so well

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.379 
it's really smooth and it's just so well
