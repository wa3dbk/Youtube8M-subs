because that's the that's the core of
catfishing<00:01:48.960> right<00:01:49.079> there<00:01:49.290> is<00:01:49.409> hooks<00:01:49.619> and

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
catfishing right there is hooks and

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.590 
catfishing right there is hooks and
weights<00:01:49.890> so<00:01:50.700> here<00:01:51.030> we're<00:01:51.149> going<00:01:51.240> take<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.450> look

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
weights so here we're going take a look

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.870 
weights so here we're going take a look
and<00:01:51.780> see<00:01:52.200> what<00:01:52.439> we<00:01:52.619> have<00:01:52.770> in<00:01:52.950> here<00:01:53.130> here<00:01:53.790> we

of these other hooks from ego paw offset
shiner<00:02:33.700> hook<00:02:35.040> so<00:02:36.040> as<00:02:36.190> you<00:02:36.280> can<00:02:36.370> see<00:02:36.640> here<00:02:37.570> it's

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
shiner hook so as you can see here it's

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.800 
shiner hook so as you can see here it's
got<00:02:38.850> doesn't<00:02:39.850> have<00:02:39.970> the<00:02:40.060> same<00:02:40.209> sort<00:02:40.450> of<00:02:40.540> curve

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
got doesn't have the same sort of curve

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.660 
got doesn't have the same sort of curve
as<00:02:40.989> a<00:02:41.080> server<00:02:41.350> circle<00:02:41.890> hook<00:02:42.010> does<00:02:42.220> pointing

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
as a server circle hook does pointing

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.040 
as a server circle hook does pointing
into<00:02:42.820> the<00:02:42.910> shank<00:02:43.150> instead<00:02:43.570> it's<00:02:43.720> got<00:02:43.870> a<00:02:43.900> nice

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
into the shank instead it's got a nice

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.620 
into the shank instead it's got a nice
wide<00:02:44.500> gap<00:02:44.890> to<00:02:45.190> it<00:02:45.340> great<00:02:45.940> for<00:02:46.150> holding<00:02:46.209> bait

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
wide gap to it great for holding bait

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.470 
wide gap to it great for holding bait
it's<00:02:47.170> real<00:02:47.800> big<00:02:48.070> and<00:02:48.220> broad<00:02:48.430> and<00:02:49.090> one<00:02:49.209> of<00:02:49.360> them

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
it's real big and broad and one of them

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.570 
it's real big and broad and one of them
as<00:02:49.720> you<00:02:49.750> can<00:02:49.959> also<00:02:50.110> see<00:02:50.230> it's<00:02:50.560> offset<00:02:51.160> so<00:02:51.459> it's

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
as you can also see it's offset so it's

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.610 
as you can also see it's offset so it's
bent<00:02:51.850> a<00:02:51.970> little<00:02:52.000> bit<00:02:52.330> so<00:02:52.840> when<00:02:53.080> the<00:02:53.170> fish<00:02:53.350> bites

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
bent a little bit so when the fish bites

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.530 
bent a little bit so when the fish bites

of my my rigs here I also got some three

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:38.759 
of my my rigs here I also got some three
ways<00:03:35.920> tools<00:03:36.390> which<00:03:37.390> now<00:03:38.200> serve<00:03:38.470> the<00:03:38.620> same

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
ways tools which now serve the same

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.220 
ways tools which now serve the same
purpose<00:03:39.190> but<00:03:39.850> there's<00:03:40.510> no<00:03:40.630> sliding<00:03:40.989> of<00:03:41.170> the

purpose but there's no sliding of the

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.340 
purpose but there's no sliding of the
weight<00:03:41.350> then<00:03:41.530> it's<00:03:42.489> all<00:03:42.840> static<00:03:43.840> sort<00:03:44.110> of<00:03:44.200> rig

you can do that too the bottom one here

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.240 
you can do that too the bottom one here
is<00:03:46.840> where<00:03:47.019> you<00:03:47.049> should<00:03:47.110> put<00:03:47.260> your<00:03:47.530> weight<00:03:47.709> so

notes and keeping the beer cozy the

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.180 
notes and keeping the beer cozy the
reason<00:04:24.300> for<00:04:24.420> that<00:04:24.450> is<00:04:24.600> is<00:04:25.020> you<00:04:25.710> know<00:04:25.830> the<00:04:25.950> older

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
reason for that is is you know the older

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.440 
reason for that is is you know the older
the<00:04:26.280> line<00:04:26.430> gets<00:04:26.640> the<00:04:26.850> more<00:04:27.030> it<00:04:27.120> has<00:04:27.300> the

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
the line gets the more it has the

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.510 
the line gets the more it has the
tendency<00:04:27.600> to<00:04:27.930> unspool<00:04:28.470> and<00:04:28.620> unravel<00:04:29.160> if

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
tendency to unspool and unravel if

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.040 
tendency to unspool and unravel if
you're<00:04:29.700> keeping<00:04:29.850> it<00:04:30.060> your<00:04:30.180> tackle<00:04:30.480> box<00:04:30.510> this

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
you're keeping it your tackle box this

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.050 
you're keeping it your tackle box this
can<00:04:31.200> become<00:04:31.320> a<00:04:31.440> mess<00:04:31.680> so<00:04:32.280> the<00:04:32.400> beer<00:04:32.550> cozy<00:04:32.880> keeps

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
can become a mess so the beer cozy keeps

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.340 
can become a mess so the beer cozy keeps
it<00:04:33.210> nice<00:04:33.330> and<00:04:33.570> tight<00:04:33.600> again<00:04:33.900> to<00:04:33.990> the<00:04:34.110> school

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
it nice and tight again to the school

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:35.870 
it nice and tight again to the school
but<00:04:34.620> then<00:04:34.740> you<00:04:34.800> can<00:04:34.920> just<00:04:35.040> pull<00:04:35.280> a<00:04:35.310> line<00:04:35.520> out<00:04:35.700> as

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
but then you can just pull a line out as

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.080 
but then you can just pull a line out as
you<00:04:36.300> need<00:04:36.450> it<00:04:36.480> just<00:04:37.410> kind<00:04:37.740> of<00:04:37.770> like<00:04:37.950> so<00:04:38.280> I<00:04:38.550> can

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
you need it just kind of like so I can

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:40.850 
you need it just kind of like so I can
suppose<00:04:39.390> much<00:04:39.690> as<00:04:39.810> I<00:04:39.870> want<00:04:40.050> clip<00:04:40.320> it<00:04:40.410> off<00:04:40.530> and

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
suppose much as I want clip it off and

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.680 
suppose much as I want clip it off and
just<00:04:41.550> find<00:04:41.820> the<00:04:41.910> end<00:04:42.090> whenever<00:04:42.360> you<00:04:42.510> need<00:04:42.660> it

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
just find the end whenever you need it

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.830 
just find the end whenever you need it
by<00:04:42.810> folding<00:04:43.320> back<00:04:43.500> a<00:04:43.530> lip<00:04:43.860> here<00:04:44.690> and<00:04:45.690> just

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
by folding back a lip here and just

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.540 
by folding back a lip here and just
grabbing<00:04:46.200> what<00:04:46.320> you<00:04:46.440> need<00:04:46.620> from<00:04:47.130> the<00:04:47.310> school

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
grabbing what you need from the school

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.940 
grabbing what you need from the school
so<00:04:48.150> good<00:04:48.660> tactic<00:04:49.110> something<00:04:49.680> I<00:04:49.710> learned<00:04:49.740> from

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
so good tactic something I learned from

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.970 
so good tactic something I learned from
southern<00:04:50.370> fishermen<00:04:51.710> definitely<00:04:52.710> something

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
southern fishermen definitely something

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.770 
southern fishermen definitely something
