00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
because working with real numbers we

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.199 
because working with real numbers we
have<00:04:15.530> to<00:04:15.650> find<00:04:15.830> a<00:04:15.950> way<00:04:16.070> to<00:04:16.130> include<00:04:16.549> all<00:04:16.880> of<00:04:16.910> the

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
have to find a way to include all of the

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.090 
have to find a way to include all of the

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
between those whole numbers and the way

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.460 
between those whole numbers and the way
to<00:04:21.739> do<00:04:21.950> that<00:04:22.100> is<00:04:22.340> with<00:04:22.550> shading<00:04:23.350> starting<00:04:24.350> at

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
to do that is with shading starting at

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:29.399 
to do that is with shading starting at
negative<00:04:24.650> one<00:04:25.130> we<00:04:25.580> shade

fractions and decimals are also part of

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:49.240 
fractions and decimals are also part of
the<00:04:46.729> answer<00:04:47.379> P<00:04:48.379> less<00:04:48.620> than<00:04:48.650> or<00:04:48.919> equal<00:04:48.979> to

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
the answer P less than or equal to

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.390 
the answer P less than or equal to
negative<00:04:49.400> three<00:04:49.879> negative<00:04:51.129> three<00:04:52.129> is<00:04:52.250> equal

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
negative three negative three is equal

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.830 
negative three negative three is equal
to<00:04:52.580> negative<00:04:52.669> three<00:04:53.090> so<00:04:53.270> it's<00:04:53.419> part<00:04:53.659> of<00:04:53.719> the

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
to negative three so it's part of the

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.559 
to negative three so it's part of the
answer<00:04:54.139> I<00:04:54.289> put<00:04:54.500> a<00:04:54.530> dot<00:04:54.939> all<00:04:55.939> of<00:04:56.150> the<00:04:56.240> numbers

00:04:56.559 --> 00:04:56.569 
answer I put a dot all of the numbers

00:04:56.569 --> 00:04:58.779 
answer I put a dot all of the numbers
less<00:04:56.840> than<00:04:56.870> negative<00:04:57.409> three<00:04:57.979> are<00:04:58.159> over<00:04:58.370> here

00:04:58.779 --> 00:04:58.789 
less than negative three are over here

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:01.600 
less than negative three are over here
so<00:04:59.030> using<00:04:59.389> shading<00:04:59.930> I<00:05:00.159> show<00:05:01.159> that<00:05:01.370> they<00:05:01.490> are

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
so using shading I show that they are

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.180 
so using shading I show that they are
part<00:05:01.849> of<00:05:01.909> the<00:05:02.030> answer<00:05:02.379> and<00:05:03.379> I<00:05:03.650> put<00:05:03.889> an<00:05:03.979> arrow

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
part of the answer and I put an arrow

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.860 
part of the answer and I put an arrow

shading<00:05:19.279> to<00:05:19.460> show<00:05:19.639> them<00:05:19.909> and<00:05:20.210> then<00:05:21.080> I<00:05:21.110> make<00:05:21.379> an

00:05:21.519 --> 00:05:21.529 
shading to show them and then I make an

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:24.189 
shading to show them and then I make an

less than or equal to one one is part of

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:28.869 
less than or equal to one one is part of
the<00:05:26.779> answer<00:05:27.110> I<00:05:27.139> put<00:05:27.500> a<00:05:27.529> dot<00:05:27.770> there<00:05:27.800> all<00:05:28.610> the

00:05:28.869 --> 00:05:28.879 
the answer I put a dot there all the

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:30.369 
the answer I put a dot there all the
numbers<00:05:29.180> less<00:05:29.240> than<00:05:29.629> one<00:05:29.779> are<00:05:29.990> part<00:05:30.199> of<00:05:30.259> the

00:05:30.369 --> 00:05:30.379 
numbers less than one are part of the

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:34.839 
numbers less than one are part of the
answer<00:05:30.529> so<00:05:30.889> I<00:05:30.919> use<00:05:31.189> shading<00:05:31.520> to<00:05:31.849> show<00:05:32.029> them<00:05:33.849> and

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:34.849 
answer so I use shading to show them and

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:38.230 
answer so I use shading to show them and
then<00:05:35.840> put<00:05:36.770> my<00:05:36.800> arrow<00:05:37.159> to<00:05:37.490> show<00:05:37.699> that<00:05:37.909> it<00:05:38.060> goes

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.240 
then put my arrow to show that it goes

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.080 
then put my arrow to show that it goes
on<00:05:38.629> and<00:05:39.620> on<00:05:39.710> and<00:05:39.770> on<00:05:40.039> forever<00:05:40.250> in<00:05:40.669> the<00:05:40.819> negative

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
on and on and on forever in the negative

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:46.059 
on and on and on forever in the negative
direction<00:05:43.960> now<00:05:44.960> it's<00:05:45.139> time<00:05:45.379> to<00:05:45.740> look<00:05:45.889> at

show<00:06:12.560> that<00:06:12.919> it<00:06:13.009> is<00:06:13.039> not<00:06:13.159> part<00:06:13.580> of<00:06:13.669> the<00:06:13.759> answer

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:14.120 
show that it is not part of the answer

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.779 
show that it is not part of the answer
what<00:06:14.719> we<00:06:14.870> do<00:06:15.050> is<00:06:15.349> we<00:06:15.830> put<00:06:16.069> what<00:06:16.310> we<00:06:16.430> call<00:06:16.639> an

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:16.789 
what we do is we put what we call an

00:06:16.789 --> 00:06:19.450 
what we do is we put what we call an
open<00:06:17.210> circle<00:06:17.690> around<00:06:17.779> it<00:06:18.110> we<00:06:18.800> don't<00:06:19.039> fill<00:06:19.310> in

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:19.460 
open circle around it we don't fill in

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.790 
open circle around it we don't fill in
the<00:06:19.580> center<00:06:19.909> of<00:06:19.969> the<00:06:20.120> circle<00:06:20.509> and<00:06:20.629> that<00:06:21.529> shows

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:21.800 
the center of the circle and that shows

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.860 
the center of the circle and that shows
that<00:06:22.520> we<00:06:22.639> are<00:06:22.759> saying<00:06:22.969> negative<00:06:23.240> 3<00:06:23.509> is<00:06:23.659> not

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:23.870 
that we are saying negative 3 is not

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:26.740 
that we are saying negative 3 is not
part<00:06:24.199> of<00:06:24.259> the<00:06:24.379> answer<00:06:24.740> but<00:06:25.400> we<00:06:26.060> are<00:06:26.210> shading

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:26.750 
part of the answer but we are shading

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:30.519 
part of the answer but we are shading
from<00:06:27.020> that<00:06:27.259> circle<00:06:28.120> all<00:06:29.120> the<00:06:29.449> way<00:06:29.599> in<00:06:29.990> the

00:06:30.519 --> 00:06:30.529 
from that circle all the way in the

00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:33.420 
from that circle all the way in the
positive<00:06:30.710> direction<00:06:31.039> and<00:06:31.819> putting<00:06:32.599> an<00:06:32.659> arrow

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:33.430 
positive direction and putting an arrow

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:36.010 
positive direction and putting an arrow
to<00:06:34.430> show<00:06:34.639> that<00:06:34.879> it<00:06:35.000> goes<00:06:35.150> on<00:06:35.389> forever<00:06:35.659> in<00:06:35.959> that

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:36.020 
to show that it goes on forever in that

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.829 
to show that it goes on forever in that
direction<00:06:36.610> this<00:06:37.610> allows<00:06:38.029> us<00:06:38.060> to<00:06:38.479> make<00:06:38.659> it

00:06:38.829 --> 00:06:38.839 
direction this allows us to make it

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:41.100 
direction this allows us to make it
clear<00:06:39.199> that<00:06:39.380> all<00:06:39.860> those<00:06:40.069> fractions<00:06:40.550> and<00:06:40.759> death

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:41.110 
clear that all those fractions and death

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:42.990 
clear that all those fractions and death
between<00:06:41.680> negative<00:06:41.919> 3<00:06:42.280> and<00:06:42.430> negative<00:06:42.460> 2<00:06:42.970> are

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:43.000 
between negative 3 and negative 2 are

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.719 
between negative 3 and negative 2 are
part<00:06:43.720> of<00:06:43.840> the<00:06:43.930> answer<00:06:44.229> they<00:06:44.740> are<00:06:45.039> all<00:06:45.310> numbers

00:06:45.719 --> 00:06:45.729 
part of the answer they are all numbers

00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:47.939 
part of the answer they are all numbers
that<00:06:46.210> are<00:06:46.419> real<00:06:46.720> and<00:06:47.020> that<00:06:47.439> are<00:06:47.590> greater<00:06:47.830> than

00:06:47.939 --> 00:06:47.949 
that are real and that are greater than

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:51.119 
that are real and that are greater than
negative<00:06:48.189> 3<00:06:48.610> but<00:06:49.389> negative<00:06:49.780> 3<00:06:49.990> itself<00:06:50.439> is<00:06:50.680> not

00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:51.129 
negative 3 but negative 3 itself is not

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:54.240 
negative 3 but negative 3 itself is not
part<00:06:51.430> of<00:06:51.520> the<00:06:51.580> answer<00:06:52.020> knowing<00:06:53.020> that<00:06:53.379> we<00:06:54.039> can

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:54.250 
part of the answer knowing that we can

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.129 
part of the answer knowing that we can
graph<00:06:54.460> cubed<00:06:54.969> less<00:06:55.330> than<00:06:55.569> negative<00:06:55.930> 1

00:06:56.129 --> 00:06:56.139 
graph cubed less than negative 1

00:06:56.139 --> 00:06:58.830 
graph cubed less than negative 1
negative<00:06:56.919> 1<00:06:57.219> is<00:06:57.639> not<00:06:57.849> less<00:06:58.060> than<00:06:58.090> itself<00:06:58.569> it's

00:06:58.830 --> 00:06:58.840 
negative 1 is not less than itself it's

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.390 
negative 1 is not less than itself it's
not<00:06:59.020> part<00:06:59.259> of<00:06:59.349> the<00:06:59.409> answer<00:06:59.740> if<00:06:59.860> we<00:07:00.009> put<00:07:00.189> an<00:07:00.280> open

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:00.400 
not part of the answer if we put an open

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.240 
not part of the answer if we put an open
circle<00:07:00.580> and<00:07:01.210> then<00:07:01.719> we<00:07:01.900> shade<00:07:02.469> all<00:07:02.770> the<00:07:02.949> numbers

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:03.250 
circle and then we shade all the numbers

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:08.339 
circle and then we shade all the numbers
less<00:07:03.490> than<00:07:03.520> it<00:07:03.939> and<00:07:04.620> put<00:07:05.620> an<00:07:05.860> arrow<00:07:07.349> showing
