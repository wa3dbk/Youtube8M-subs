attention<00:01:44.430> I<00:01:45.000> ask<00:01:45.270> patients<00:01:45.899> about<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.290> all

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
attention I ask patients about it all

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.340 
attention I ask patients about it all
the<00:01:46.619> time<00:01:47.119> it's<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.210> very<00:01:48.420> difficult<00:01:48.659> area

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
the time it's a very difficult area

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.310 
the time it's a very difficult area
because<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:49.770> think<00:01:50.100> even<00:01:50.430> one<00:01:50.880> supplement<00:01:51.810> by

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
because I think even one supplement by

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.969 
because I think even one supplement by
itself<00:01:52.740> perhaps<00:01:53.610> not<00:01:53.909> be<00:01:54.149> dangerous<00:01:54.829> but<00:01:55.829> we

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
itself perhaps not be dangerous but we

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.440 
itself perhaps not be dangerous but we
really<00:01:56.189> don't<00:01:56.310> know<00:01:56.520> what<00:01:56.790> happens<00:01:57.180> when<00:01:57.270> you

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
really don't know what happens when you

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.090 
really don't know what happens when you
combine<00:01:57.600> these<00:01:58.140> together<00:01:58.439> or<00:01:58.920> with

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
combine these together or with

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.730 
combine these together or with
prescription<00:01:59.759> medicines<00:02:00.299> so<00:02:01.110> I'd<00:02:01.409> be<00:02:01.500> curious

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
prescription medicines so I'd be curious

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.139 
prescription medicines so I'd be curious
to<00:02:02.460> find<00:02:03.420> out<00:02:03.810> what<00:02:03.869> people<00:02:04.460> are<00:02:05.460> seeing<00:02:05.939> in

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
to find out what people are seeing in

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.340 
to find out what people are seeing in
their<00:02:06.270> practices
