at<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.649> end<00:00:46.850> so<00:00:47.850> I<00:00:47.910> can<00:00:48.180> extrude<00:00:49.550> the<00:00:50.550> scrapple

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
at the end so I can extrude the scrapple

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.740 
at the end so I can extrude the scrapple
out<00:00:52.640> of<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.760> container<00:00:56.510> didn't<00:00:57.510> think<00:00:57.660> I

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
out of the container didn't think I

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.740 
out of the container didn't think I
could<00:00:57.780> cut<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.199> with<00:00:58.640> one<00:00:59.640> hand<00:00:59.670> to<00:01:00.390> open<00:01:00.629> it

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
could cut it with one hand to open it

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:07.940 
could cut it with one hand to open it
and<00:01:04.129> make<00:01:05.129> several<00:01:05.489> slices<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.960> I<00:01:07.170> got<00:01:07.740> him

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
and make several slices it I got him

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:25.080 
and make several slices it I got him
whoops<00:01:08.930> maybe<00:01:09.930> I'll<00:01:10.080> have<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:11.030> four<00:01:12.030> or<00:01:12.180> so

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.600 

over<00:02:03.900> here<00:02:04.350> is

over here is

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.330 
over here is
the<00:02:06.180> fragments<00:02:06.810> grapple<00:02:07.290> with<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:08.220> theater

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.540

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:31.309 

so<00:02:18.550> gotten<00:02:19.180> crispy<00:02:19.510> enough<00:02:19.570> to<00:02:19.840> talk<00:02:20.050> over

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.190 

the<00:02:32.219> wildest<00:02:32.579> graph<00:02:32.790> was<00:02:32.969> cooking<00:02:33.390> I'm<00:02:34.049> going

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
the wildest graph was cooking I'm going

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:40.390 
the wildest graph was cooking I'm going
to<00:02:34.260> put<00:02:34.670> the<00:02:35.670> remainder<00:02:37.129> into<00:02:38.129> a<00:02:38.159> plastic<00:02:38.430> bag

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
to put the remainder into a plastic bag

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.270 
to put the remainder into a plastic bag
for<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.790> preservation<00:02:42.569> for<00:02:43.530> another<00:02:44.040> day<00:02:44.249> of

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
for the preservation for another day of

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.729 
for the preservation for another day of
cooking<00:02:45.109> kind<00:02:46.109> of<00:02:46.170> hard<00:02:46.349> to<00:02:46.409> do<00:02:46.590> this

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
cooking kind of hard to do this

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.679 
cooking kind of hard to do this
one-handed<00:02:47.129> so<00:02:47.609> maybe<00:02:47.790> I'll<00:02:48.000> put<00:02:48.150> this<00:02:48.359> down

00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:48.689 
one-handed so maybe I'll put this down

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:54.410 
one-handed so maybe I'll put this down
here<00:02:50.269> let's<00:02:51.269> see<00:02:51.480> if<00:02:51.569> I<00:02:51.659> can<00:02:53.150> camera<00:02:54.150> shoot

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
here let's see if I can camera shoot

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:13.339 
here let's see if I can camera shoot
while<00:02:54.959> I<00:02:54.989> use<00:02:55.230> the<00:02:55.469> hands<00:03:02.150> zip<00:03:03.150> it<00:03:03.299> up<00:03:11.449> now<00:03:12.449> this

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
while I use the hands zip it up now this

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:15.229 
while I use the hands zip it up now this
will<00:03:13.500> be<00:03:13.590> preserved<00:03:14.010> for<00:03:14.459> future<00:03:14.730> use

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
will be preserved for future use

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:23.539 
will be preserved for future use
wouldn't<00:03:16.199> want<00:03:16.379> it<00:03:16.469> goin<00:03:16.709> bad<00:03:22.099> these<00:03:23.099> scrapple

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
wouldn't want it goin bad these scrapple

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:31.520 
wouldn't want it goin bad these scrapple
continues<00:03:23.969> to<00:03:24.090> cook<00:03:24.359> cook<00:03:28.400> a<00:03:29.400> little<00:03:30.150> bit<00:03:30.530> take

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
continues to cook cook a little bit take

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:51.030 
continues to cook cook a little bit take
it<00:03:31.650> easy<00:03:31.949> thickness

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.410 

and<00:03:52.040> I<00:03:52.160> think<00:03:52.430> to<00:03:52.489> go<00:03:52.760> with<00:03:52.910> the<00:03:53.030> scrapple

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
and I think to go with the scrapple

00:03:53.420 --> 00:04:04.900 
and I think to go with the scrapple
today<00:03:55.900> legs<00:04:02.920> I'll<00:04:03.920> be<00:04:04.069> back<00:04:04.099> when<00:04:04.549> it's<00:04:04.580> time

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
today legs I'll be back when it's time

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.720 
today legs I'll be back when it's time
to<00:04:05.030> flip<00:04:05.150> the<00:04:05.330> scrapple
