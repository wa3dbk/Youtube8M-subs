00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
which apparently gives you more volume

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.500 
which apparently gives you more volume
I<00:00:43.629> also<00:00:44.170> dry<00:00:44.559> the<00:00:45.280> other<00:00:45.429> way<00:00:45.760> first<00:00:46.120> the<00:00:46.300> box

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:58.910 
I also dry the other way first the box
that<00:00:47.019> gives<00:00:47.230> you<00:00:47.320> more<00:00:47.440> lift<00:00:47.710> as<00:00:47.920> well

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.550 

when<00:00:59.700> my<00:00:59.850> hair<00:01:00.060> is<00:01:00.090> almost<00:01:00.540> completely<00:01:01.020> dry<00:01:01.290> I

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:01.560 
when my hair is almost completely dry I

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.820 
when my hair is almost completely dry I
use<00:01:02.400> a<00:01:02.430> wax<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:03.120> make<00:01:04.020> it<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.230> bit<00:01:04.350> more<00:01:04.530> of<00:01:04.590> a<00:01:04.650> wet

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
use a wax to make it a bit more of a wet

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.070 
use a wax to make it a bit more of a wet
look<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.910> one<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.090> used<00:01:06.450> it<00:01:06.570> as<00:01:06.660> shockwaves

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
look the one I used it as shockwaves

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.380 
look the one I used it as shockwaves
it's<00:01:07.350> strong<00:01:07.740> so<00:01:08.370> it<00:01:08.490> also<00:01:08.730> helps<00:01:09.030> keep<00:01:09.270> the

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
it's strong so it also helps keep the

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.470 
it's strong so it also helps keep the
shape<00:01:09.600> as<00:01:09.780> long<00:01:10.640> small<00:01:11.640> amount<00:01:11.880> don't<00:01:12.300> want<00:01:12.420> to

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:12.480 
shape as long small amount don't want to

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:22.429 
shape as long small amount don't want to
weigh<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.660> hair<00:01:12.690> down

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.350

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
because my hair is naturally wavy I'll

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.389

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:26.399 
be using straighteners you might not

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:37.100 
be using straighteners you might not
have<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.640> do<00:01:26.700> that

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110
