violence our study specifically did show

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.929 
violence our study specifically did show
that<00:00:19.350> playing<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:19.920> violent<00:00:20.250> video<00:00:20.310> game<00:00:20.699> can

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
that playing a violent video game can

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.570 
that playing a violent video game can
desensitize<00:00:21.240> players<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.439> violence<00:00:22.830> so<00:00:23.369> there

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
desensitize players to violence so there

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.679 
desensitize players to violence so there
are<00:00:23.670> many<00:00:23.820> other<00:00:24.029> things<00:00:24.119> that<00:00:24.449> can
