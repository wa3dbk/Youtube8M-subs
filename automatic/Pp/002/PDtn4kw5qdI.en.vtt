00:02:11.929 --> 00:02:11.939 
little bit in doing that is it's just

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:13.410 
little bit in doing that is it's just
going<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.239> give<00:02:12.810> you<00:02:13.079> cancer

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
as sore as what it would as well in

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.130 
as sore as what it would as well in
their<00:02:24.340> case<00:02:24.580> in<00:02:24.910> the<00:02:25.209> case<00:02:25.390> if<00:02:25.569> you<00:02:25.660> roll<00:02:25.900> your

hand down still get a sore wrist you can

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.430 
hand down still get a sore wrist you can
obviously<00:02:28.150> shake<00:02:28.510> it<00:02:28.630> out<00:02:28.720> as<00:02:28.840> well<00:02:29.050> but<00:02:29.200> try

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
obviously shake it out as well but try

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.330 
obviously shake it out as well but try
that<00:02:29.680> one<00:02:29.890> as<00:02:30.040> well

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
that one as well

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.130 
that one as well
lowering<00:02:30.850> your<00:02:31.000> wrist<00:02:31.239> down<00:02:31.420> so<00:02:31.660> basically

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
lowering your wrist down so basically

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.809 
lowering your wrist down so basically
having<00:02:32.410> your<00:02:32.530> guitar<00:02:32.890> appear<00:02:33.130> and<00:02:33.340> just<00:02:33.640> kind

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
having your guitar appear and just kind

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:36.420 
having your guitar appear and just kind
of<00:02:33.880> rolling<00:02:34.150> your<00:02:34.450> wrist<00:02:34.660> down<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:36.160> next

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
of rolling your wrist down the next

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.040 
of rolling your wrist down the next
thing<00:02:36.580> that<00:02:36.610> you<00:02:37.030> can<00:02:37.060> try<00:02:37.390> and<00:02:37.660> do<00:02:37.810> is

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
thing that you can try and do is

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.199 
thing that you can try and do is
actually<00:02:38.500> pinch<00:02:38.830> the<00:02:39.010> guitar<00:02:39.370> neck<00:02:39.580> so<00:02:40.120> you

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
actually pinch the guitar neck so you

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.270 
actually pinch the guitar neck so you
can<00:02:40.420> see<00:02:40.569> my<00:02:40.750> when<00:02:41.319> I<00:02:41.350> play<00:02:41.590> bar<00:02:41.830> chords<00:02:42.160> my

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
can see my when I play bar chords my

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.490 
can see my when I play bar chords my
thumb<00:02:42.610> is<00:02:42.790> sitting<00:02:43.120> here<00:02:43.360> so<00:02:43.870> pinching<00:02:44.380> the

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
thumb is sitting here so pinching the

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.290 
thumb is sitting here so pinching the
guitar<00:02:44.860> neck<00:02:45.099> so<00:02:45.280> it's<00:02:45.400> almost<00:02:45.489> like<00:02:45.670> I've<00:02:45.940> got

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
guitar neck so it's almost like I've got

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.970 
guitar neck so it's almost like I've got
this<00:02:46.390> pinching<00:02:46.840> action<00:02:47.170> so<00:02:47.319> if<00:02:47.380> you<00:02:47.440> pinch<00:02:47.800> the

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
this pinching action so if you pinch the

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.580 
this pinching action so if you pinch the
guitar<00:02:48.340> neck<00:02:48.610> not<00:02:49.209> wrap<00:02:49.600> around<00:02:50.019> so<00:02:50.350> I'm<00:02:50.440> not

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
guitar neck not wrap around so I'm not

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.410 
guitar neck not wrap around so I'm not
wrapping<00:02:51.010> my<00:02:51.130> hand<00:02:51.370> around<00:02:51.580> like<00:02:51.700> that<00:02:51.970> just

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
wrapping my hand around like that just

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.660 
wrapping my hand around like that just
pinching<00:02:52.840> I<00:02:52.989> find<00:02:53.500> that<00:02:53.650> helps<00:02:53.830> too<00:02:54.220> so<00:02:54.459> it's

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
pinching I find that helps too so it's

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.910 
pinching I find that helps too so it's
almost<00:02:54.880> you<00:02:55.630> know<00:02:55.750> better<00:02:55.959> technique<00:02:56.500> can

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
almost you know better technique can

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.039 
almost you know better technique can
