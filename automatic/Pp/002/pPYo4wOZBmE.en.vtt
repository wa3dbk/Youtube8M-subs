00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
computer it's floating to the right

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:49.509 
computer it's floating to the right
that's<00:03:48.769> just<00:03:49.040> weird

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
brightens up they'll see the distance it

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:05.979 
brightens up they'll see the distance it
traveled<00:04:00.199> because<00:04:00.819> it's<00:04:01.819> gone<00:04:02.139> yeah<00:04:03.139> I<00:04:04.959> saw<00:04:05.959> it

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:07.629 
traveled because it's gone yeah I saw it
going<00:04:06.349> to<00:04:06.469> the<00:04:06.590> right<00:04:06.769> so<00:04:06.980> it<00:04:07.069> might<00:04:07.219> pop<00:04:07.459> up

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:07.639 
going to the right so it might pop up

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:11.920 
going to the right so it might pop up
again<00:04:07.819> over<00:04:08.120> here<00:04:08.239> to<00:04:08.870> this<00:04:09.019> side<00:04:10.780> that's<00:04:11.780> a

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
that no plane can do that because it was

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.159 
that no plane can do that because it was
floating<00:04:19.489> to<00:04:19.579> the<00:04:19.669> right<00:04:19.970> -<00:04:20.299> laughs<00:04:20.630> now<00:04:20.959> I'm
