00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:10.700 

but<00:00:09.570> I<00:00:09.630> think<00:00:09.840> there's<00:00:10.080> something<00:00:10.469> really

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
but I think there's something really

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.180 
but I think there's something really
fundamental<00:00:11.309> in<00:00:12.030> in<00:00:12.799> interpreting<00:00:13.799> French

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
fundamental in in interpreting French

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.720 
fundamental in in interpreting French
music<00:00:14.549> that<00:00:15.480> is<00:00:15.660> that<00:00:16.109> is<00:00:16.260> great<00:00:16.730> rhythmic

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
music that is that is great rhythmic

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.090 
music that is that is great rhythmic
energy<00:00:17.940> we<00:00:18.779> always<00:00:19.080> think<00:00:19.320> of<00:00:19.410> French<00:00:19.710> music

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
energy we always think of French music

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.010 
energy we always think of French music
as<00:00:20.250> maybe<00:00:20.520> something<00:00:21.000> that<00:00:21.240> we<00:00:21.539> qualify

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
as maybe something that we qualify

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.130 
as maybe something that we qualify
sometimes<00:00:22.500> as<00:00:22.939> impaired<00:00:23.939> impressionistic<00:00:24.630> I

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
sometimes as impaired impressionistic I

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.490 
sometimes as impaired impressionistic I
have<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.039> slightly<00:00:26.820> different<00:00:27.000> view<00:00:27.930> on<00:00:28.140> this<00:00:28.289> I

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
have a slightly different view on this I

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.410 
have a slightly different view on this I
think<00:00:28.859> you<00:00:29.189> create<00:00:29.609> that<00:00:29.789> illusion<00:00:30.150> of

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
think you create that illusion of

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.720 
think you create that illusion of
something<00:00:30.660> really<00:00:31.430> colorful<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:32.460> beautiful

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
something really colorful and beautiful

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.330 
something really colorful and beautiful
bike<00:00:33.270> by<00:00:33.840> actually<00:00:34.200> controlling<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.829> lot<00:00:35.070> of

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
bike by actually controlling a lot of

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.500 
bike by actually controlling a lot of
the<00:00:35.790> details<00:00:36.710> in<00:00:37.710> inside<00:00:38.610> this<00:00:38.760> music<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.300> and

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
the details in inside this music and and

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.930 
the details in inside this music and and
I<00:00:39.660> think<00:00:39.899> that's<00:00:40.079> why<00:00:40.290> what<00:00:41.250> yoga<00:00:41.550> has<00:00:41.790> been

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
I think that's why what yoga has been

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:49.220 
I think that's why what yoga has been
able<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.210> capture<00:00:42.510> very<00:00:42.930> well<00:00:43.140> in<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.440> bell

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.410 

I<00:00:49.260> mean<00:00:49.980> as<00:00:50.160> we<00:00:50.190> are<00:00:50.400> speaking<00:00:50.700> about<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.300> know

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
I mean as we are speaking about you know

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.420 
I mean as we are speaking about you know
the<00:00:51.570> work<00:00:51.750> we<00:00:51.960> do<00:00:52.140> with<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.530> sound<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.130> trying

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
the work we do with the sound and trying

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.320 
the work we do with the sound and trying
to<00:00:54.120> create<00:00:54.330> the<00:00:54.980> sound<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.130> is<00:00:56.280> rich<00:00:56.580> but<00:00:57.000> yet

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.330 
to create the sound that is rich but yet

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:02.060 
to create the sound that is rich but yet
as<00:00:58.110> as<00:00:58.470> as<00:00:59.450> air<00:01:00.450> in<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:01.110> know<00:01:01.200> I<00:01:01.230> I<00:01:01.410> like<00:01:01.860> I

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
as as as air in it you know I I like I

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.800 
as as as air in it you know I I like I
like<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.340> sound<00:01:02.700> that<00:01:02.820> has<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.030> richness<00:01:03.420> but

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:03.810 
like a sound that has a richness but

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.170 
like a sound that has a richness but
also<00:01:04.020> breathe<00:01:04.410> it<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.770> I<00:01:05.400> think<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.760> sentence

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
also breathe it and I think the sentence

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.540 
also breathe it and I think the sentence
is<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.870> ideal<00:01:07.350> reporter<00:01:07.830> for<00:01:08.040> this<00:01:08.190> because

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:08.550 
is the ideal reporter for this because

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.760 
is the ideal reporter for this because
if<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:08.820> think<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.330> slow<00:01:09.570> movement<00:01:09.990> you

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
if you think of the slow movement you

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.760 
if you think of the slow movement you
have<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.130> have<00:01:11.280> this<00:01:11.430> kind<00:01:11.670> of<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:12.770> feral

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
have to have this kind of a feral

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.340 
have to have this kind of a feral
feeling<00:01:14.310> in<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.640> melody<00:01:14.970> that<00:01:15.960> is<00:01:15.990> just

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
feeling in the melody that is just

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.430 
feeling in the melody that is just
trenton<00:01:16.770> but<00:01:16.950> by<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.330> deep<00:01:18.330> richness<00:01:18.870> of<00:01:19.290> the

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
trenton but by the deep richness of the

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.320 
trenton but by the deep richness of the
pedal<00:01:19.740> sounds<00:01:20.130> of<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.400> organ<00:01:20.820> so<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.090> have

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
pedal sounds of the organ so you have

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.330 
pedal sounds of the organ so you have
those<00:01:21.450> kind<00:01:21.690> of<00:01:21.780> two<00:01:21.930> extremes<00:01:22.410> where<00:01:23.040> you<00:01:23.130> can

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
those kind of two extremes where you can

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.910 
those kind of two extremes where you can
really<00:01:23.610> find<00:01:24.150> overtones<00:01:24.690> in<00:01:24.930> ink<00:01:25.560> reading

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
really find overtones in ink reading

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.219 
really find overtones in ink reading
that<00:01:26.100> might<00:01:26.310> be<00:01:26.670> between<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.330> two<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:28.050> two

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
that might be between the two the two

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.109 
that might be between the two the two
bodies<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.830> it's<00:01:29.070> not<00:01:29.220> always<00:01:29.400> easy<00:01:29.790> because

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
bodies and it's not always easy because

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.850 
bodies and it's not always easy because
you<00:01:30.420> know<00:01:30.450> of<00:01:30.720> course<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.140> sounds<00:01:31.500> coming<00:01:31.710> out

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
you know of course the sounds coming out

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.180 
you know of course the sounds coming out
of<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.130> pipes<00:01:33.259> you<00:01:34.259> know<00:01:34.290> there's<00:01:34.619> that<00:01:34.830> delay

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
of the pipes you know there's that delay

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.140 
of the pipes you know there's that delay
there<00:01:35.550> is<00:01:35.670> that<00:01:35.850> even<00:01:36.570> intonation

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
there is that even intonation

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.190 
there is that even intonation
adjustments<00:01:39.150> that<00:01:39.300> the<00:01:39.450> orchestra<00:01:39.660> has<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:40.080> do

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
adjustments that the orchestra has to do

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.980 
adjustments that the orchestra has to do
and<00:01:40.410> this<00:01:40.770> tells<00:01:41.130> all<00:01:41.280> tells<00:01:41.940> a<00:01:42.060> lot<00:01:42.180> about<00:01:42.240> how

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
and this tells all tells a lot about how

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.570 
and this tells all tells a lot about how
flexible<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.649> orchestra<00:01:44.040> can<00:01:44.190> be<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.550> really

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
flexible the orchestra can be and really

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.660 
flexible the orchestra can be and really
in<00:01:45.060> trying<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.720> find<00:01:45.930> that<00:01:46.130> that<00:01:47.130> beauty<00:01:47.550> in

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
in trying to find that that beauty in

00:01:47.670 --> 00:02:07.080 
in trying to find that that beauty in
the<00:01:47.790> in<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.060> tone

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.149
