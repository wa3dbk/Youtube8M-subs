00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
looks like the leaves have clogged the

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.839 
looks like the leaves have clogged the
gutters<00:00:06.060> up<00:00:07.099> if<00:00:08.099> you<00:00:08.189> look<00:00:08.340> at<00:00:08.490> that<00:00:08.639> a<00:00:08.730> little

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
gutters up if you look at that a little

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.540 
gutters up if you look at that a little
closer<00:00:09.120> and<00:00:10.110> what<00:00:10.290> happens<00:00:10.620> the<00:00:10.889> water<00:00:11.190> does

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
closer and what happens the water does

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.450
