00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:36.050 
this is reverse threaded but we're going
to<00:02:19.410> count<00:02:19.709> one<00:02:20.810> two<00:02:31.250> 25:25<00:02:32.250> revolutions<00:02:34.970> so<00:02:35.970> as

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
to count one two 25:25 revolutions so as

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.580 
to count one two 25:25 revolutions so as
we're<00:02:36.239> taking<00:02:36.390> this<00:02:36.629> adjustment<00:02:37.170> sleeve<00:02:37.379> off

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
we're taking this adjustment sleeve off

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.009 
we're taking this adjustment sleeve off
we're<00:02:37.860> counting<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.340> number<00:02:38.580> of<00:02:38.670> revolutions

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:43.820 

okay<00:02:43.019> and<00:02:43.140> we're<00:02:43.230> going<00:02:43.319> to<00:02:43.379> put<00:02:43.560> a<00:02:43.590> little<00:02:43.739> bit

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
okay and we're going to put a little bit

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.449 
okay and we're going to put a little bit
of<00:02:43.980> chassis<00:02:44.610> grease<00:02:45.830> more<00:02:46.830> than<00:02:47.010> where<00:02:47.370> the

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
of chassis grease more than where the

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:48.949 
of chassis grease more than where the
sleeve<00:02:47.670> is<00:02:47.849> going<00:02:48.000> to<00:02:48.060> go<00:02:48.150> on<00:02:48.269> the<00:02:48.390> new<00:02:48.510> tie<00:02:48.690> rod

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
sleeve is going to go on the new tie rod

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:54.830 
sleeve is going to go on the new tie rod
here<00:02:52.400> thread<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.640> adjustment<00:02:54.209> sleeve<00:02:54.450> back

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
here thread the adjustment sleeve back

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.690 
here thread the adjustment sleeve back
on<00:02:55.099> 25<00:02:56.099> revolutions<00:02:56.989> so<00:02:57.989> we've<00:02:58.409> got<00:02:58.590> these<00:02:58.769> we

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
on 25 revolutions so we've got these we

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.369 
on 25 revolutions so we've got these we
have<00:02:59.849> these<00:02:59.970> Jam<00:03:00.239> nuts<00:03:00.510> loosened<00:03:00.989> up<00:03:01.110> pretty

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
have these Jam nuts loosened up pretty

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:05.000 
have these Jam nuts loosened up pretty
good<00:03:01.590> and<00:03:02.030> this<00:03:03.319> adjustment<00:03:04.319> sleeve<00:03:04.560> it<00:03:04.800> will

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
good and this adjustment sleeve it will

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.220 
good and this adjustment sleeve it will
rotate<00:03:05.250> in<00:03:05.610> there

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
rotate in there

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.080 
rotate in there
it's<00:03:06.470> a<00:03:06.500> little<00:03:06.740> bit<00:03:06.890> tricky<00:03:07.220> to<00:03:07.700> get<00:03:07.820> it<00:03:07.940> to

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
it's a little bit tricky to get it to

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.120 
it's a little bit tricky to get it to
thread<00:03:08.480> on<00:03:08.720> and<00:03:08.900> off<00:03:09.020> but<00:03:09.380> it's<00:03:09.650> do<00:03:09.830> a<00:03:09.860> wall

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
thread on and off but it's do a wall

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:11.350 
thread on and off but it's do a wall
just<00:03:10.340> takes<00:03:10.550> a<00:03:10.640> little<00:03:10.730> bit<00:03:10.880> of<00:03:11.060> monkeying

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
just takes a little bit of monkeying

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.540 
just takes a little bit of monkeying
around<00:03:11.510> and<00:03:12.260> now<00:03:12.560> we're<00:03:12.710> going<00:03:12.800> to<00:03:12.860> double

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
around and now we're going to double

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.010 
around and now we're going to double
check<00:03:13.790> our<00:03:13.820> measurements<00:03:14.480> we've<00:03:14.660> got<00:03:14.840> it<00:03:14.930> on

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
check our measurements we've got it on

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.770 
check our measurements we've got it on
there<00:03:15.140> 25<00:03:15.680> revolutions

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
there 25 revolutions

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:24.180 
there 25 revolutions
what's<00:03:17.780> the<00:03:17.990> 25<00:03:19.000> 125<00:03:20.000> and<00:03:20.390> 23<00:03:20.930> 30<00:03:21.200> cents<00:03:21.710> a<00:03:22.870> mile

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
what's the 25 125 and 23 30 cents a mile

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.780 
what's the 25 125 and 23 30 cents a mile
we're<00:03:25.190> like<00:03:25.340> a<00:03:25.370> twenty<00:03:25.790> six<00:03:26.000> seven<00:03:26.270> eight

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
we're like a twenty six seven eight

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.580 
we're like a twenty six seven eight
check<00:03:28.790> our<00:03:28.940> other<00:03:28.970> measurements<00:03:29.750> this<00:03:30.380> is

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
check our other measurements this is

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:36.280 
check our other measurements this is
seventeen<00:03:31.520> and<00:03:31.970> eleven<00:03:32.920> sixteenths<00:03:35.290> yeah

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
seventeen and eleven sixteenths yeah

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.710 
seventeen and eleven sixteenths yeah
it's<00:03:36.709> like<00:03:36.950> it's<00:03:37.160> seventeen<00:03:37.610> six<00:03:37.910> seven<00:03:38.600> eight

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
it's like it's seventeen six seven eight

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.090 
it's like it's seventeen six seven eight
so<00:03:39.170> it<00:03:39.260> needs<00:03:39.410> to<00:03:39.530> go<00:03:39.650> in<00:03:39.830> a<00:03:39.950> little<00:03:40.040> bit<00:03:42.100> this

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
so it needs to go in a little bit this

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.430 
so it needs to go in a little bit this
is<00:03:43.160> a<00:03:43.370> great<00:03:43.730> example<00:03:43.910> of<00:03:44.420> why<00:03:44.630> it's<00:03:44.870> important

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
is a great example of why it's important

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.040 
is a great example of why it's important
to<00:03:45.650> take<00:03:46.010> accurate<00:03:46.340> measurements<00:03:47.239> and<00:03:47.390> not

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.050 
to take accurate measurements and not

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.770 
to take accurate measurements and not
just<00:03:48.410> count<00:03:48.650> the<00:03:48.830> number<00:03:48.860> of<00:03:49.130> revolutions<00:03:49.780> the

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
just count the number of revolutions the

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.930 
just count the number of revolutions the
tie-rod<00:03:51.020> was<00:03:51.530> a<00:03:51.560> slightly<00:03:52.010> different<00:03:52.310> length

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
tie-rod was a slightly different length

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.590 
tie-rod was a slightly different length
so<00:03:53.720> the<00:03:54.050> revolutions<00:03:54.680> were<00:03:54.890> off<00:03:55.150> but<00:03:56.150> with<00:03:56.420> our

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
so the revolutions were off but with our

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.330 
so the revolutions were off but with our
measurements<00:03:57.260> we<00:03:57.440> were<00:03:57.560> able<00:03:57.890> to<00:03:57.920> get<00:03:58.220> it

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
measurements we were able to get it

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.000 
measurements we were able to get it
really<00:03:58.760> close<00:03:59.320> tighten<00:04:00.320> the<00:04:00.380> bolts<00:04:00.680> on<00:04:00.860> the

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
really close tighten the bolts on the

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.010 
really close tighten the bolts on the
adjustment<00:04:01.550> sleeve<00:04:01.880> to<00:04:02.209> hold<00:04:02.630> it<00:04:02.780> in<00:04:02.900> place

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:03.020 
adjustment sleeve to hold it in place

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.080 
adjustment sleeve to hold it in place
we're<00:04:03.650> going<00:04:03.739> to<00:04:03.830> slip<00:04:04.100> the<00:04:04.310> tie<00:04:04.640> rod<00:04:04.850> into
