 lakes I looked found a map in general 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:34.320
 this lake there are two lakes they are straight 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:37.050
 The map shows that they are connected by a duct 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:43.160

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:46.649

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:53.160
 cleaned there on fishing entrails for 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.850
 Begin to see how this is a head. By the way. 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.090
 head I do not need to cut because it is 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:02.550
 I'm frying 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:05.330
 perch with the head can, in principle, these 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.909
 fins trimmed with scissors 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:12.030

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.210
 storm 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.990
 Now in this way fins 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.990
 cropped 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:27.420
 principle so here's how when cleaning 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.430

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.180
 hand flies 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:38.130

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:42.049
 kitchen in general when i'm at my house 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:45.509
 street some place let's say there is and 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:47.610
 table and there you can clear without problems 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:51.659
 it's a scratch, even if I get somewhere there 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.909
 but in the garden let it not rot there 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:58.900
 then with time 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:02:02.650
