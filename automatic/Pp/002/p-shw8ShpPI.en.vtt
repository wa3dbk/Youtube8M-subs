00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 in this episode of how you play 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.600
 we will talk about what sensitivity is 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:14.460
 because it is important and above all how 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:16.410
 find our ideal sensitivity for 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.690
 gays nyse lost in game payout 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.939
 I'm a jack of hearts and I'm cyber 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.010
 shot and we're here today guys run to 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.960
 bets of how to play tonight in 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.300
 which we talk about some advice on 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.740
 how to improve on fps and today 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.779
 let's talk about sensitivity because it is 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.189
 important how to manage it e 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.160
 especially with a method that works 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.020
 both on PC and on console to set it 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.480
 at best, guys, then let's go 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.430
 from the beginning what is sensitivity la 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.649
 sensitivity is the speed with which we 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.390
 let's move the cursor in play then if 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.870
 I'm playing a game that I know how to play 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.910
 on the 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.160
 I click at a point my wine goes into 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.199
 that point is more important instead in the 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.059
 fps when the course instead reja yes 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.899
 corresponds with the point where we 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.390
 let's look 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.219
 so if I turn right with the mouse 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.480
 my friend will look to the right if i am 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.670
 bent my friend to the left 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.860
 will look to the left because of its own 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.510
 as in reality we approach 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.340
 to things in the space around us 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.720
 thanks to our sensitivity that 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.369
 each to his own 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.890
 similarly when we play ourselves 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.420
 we have a space on the map and 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.189
 we must approach our own 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.840
 health of play to be equal to 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.939
 what we are imagining then 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.890
 guys and concrete if I want to aim 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.090
 an opponent is important with the 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.700
 cursor I can bring 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.080
 on the opponent not better cm on the right 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.060
 half a centimeter to the left because 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.650
 otherwise guys that's when on Saturday 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.270
 evening we are drunk we want to take 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.979
 the handle but we can't do it 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.390
 everyone on youtube of symbola own 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.270
 so a real number right here 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.680
 you must inspire me that I know the place 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.390
 favorite youtuber that says look 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.520
 we write inherent self best is the five 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.049
 guys set the second continuity 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.509
 another person is completely useless 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.220
 why as if you now use a 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.180
 walk around like I don't 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.860
 makes absolutely no sense 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.750
 you must set it according to yours 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.240
 head and then today we will explain to him how 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.040
 make nice boys then the concept is 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.590
 very always 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.550
 first of all we must start from a range 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.440
 of right values 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.570
 so let's say let's exclude the 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.270
 sensitivity to one that maybe a little too much 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.790
 low but above all we are going to exclude 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.290
 high sensitivity values because not 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.270
 let's make this mistake 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.240
 sensitivity is exactly the opposite 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:19.880
 of precision those boys movements 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.430
 long lever arm to make a 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.100
 small shift of the recioto implies 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.080
 displacement of the most precise game said 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.150
 so let's start with the technique then 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.690
 different that you play at the PCI was at 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.220
 consul 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.900
 the method is always the same do a 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.490
 nice private match put up against 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.320
 a wall and mark where you are now 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.680
 so do a nice shot at the 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.570
 Wall 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.490
 having said that, close your eyes and do 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:43.070
 a ride around you then a 360 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:45.260
 degrees or 180 so it is the same with 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.580
 boys with the mouse or with the minds and 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.530
 you want dates to finish 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.760
 then reopen naturally 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.830
 eyes we go to make ours 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.970
 considerations we went a little 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.920
 beyond the sign 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.870
 well then the sensitivity is too high 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.980
 we have to lower ourselves a bit instead 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.660
 found a little earlier 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.670
 well then sensitivity means that a 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.200
 a little bit we have to raise it a little later 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.930
 try again to get this 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.970
 process 3 4 to 5 times until it does 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.769
 you will be able to get the most result 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.050
 As accurate as possible at this point you will have 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:15.560
 found a sensitivity that fits 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:17.299
 enough to your instinctive movement 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.040
 ok maybe comes for some of you 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:20.720
 It might seem a place as they come 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.310
 but we can tell you that it works because 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.290
 instead of adapting to the excluded number 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.760
 that I know 567 that doesn't count 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.650
 absolutely nothing on the move 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.450
 in this way we are adapting to 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.950
 what we already appreciated before then 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.959
 we are essentially adapting to 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.360
 how we want ourselves in space then 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:37.190
 boys if not always with millimeter and 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.709
 super precise will always be easier 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.730
 get used to your instinctive sensibility 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.320
 which we did with this method 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.430
 rather than a funny number 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.680
 we chose to start a game 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.630
 as always we invite you to pass 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.880
 on our facebook page to know 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.860
 surveys the topics covered and 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.910
 all the backstory of the ros in game and there 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.910
 let's see with an upcoming video
