00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:10.360
 today I'm going to work some tropical nails 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.750
 let's start 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:16.660
 this set as it says is a filling 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:19.419
 because I brought a very similar set but 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.250
 they were gliders of very different tones 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:23.950
 this time I could not overtake him as 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.230
 I would normally do it and eliminate the tip 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:29.590
 but how can you see my bed there? 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:32.290
 nail is still fine I have acrylic by 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:35.170
 that nothing else applied the 'prime in in the 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.660
 growth area because yes yes then 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.670
 the nail moves and grows and leaves as 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.070
 raising so you have to clean everything 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:48.640
 that to be able to accommodate a set again 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:51.430
 and that it sticks well does not always work like that 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.700
 because I'm the one who thinks that 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.770
 work like that acrylic you spend 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:00.100
 of color but this time as I have 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:02.500
 quite well I could work the set or 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:06.100
 I have more in another small boat to fill 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.380
 here the yellow then I can 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.540
 Now I'm done, and usually I 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.870
 I would tell them not to spend it on him 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:16.300
 of the acrylic use an enamel but 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.400
 if you have enough, it is better because 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.710
 already kills two birds with one stone 'you're 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.960
 forming the structure at the same time 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.060
 that you are already with your acrylic tone 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.180
 you need to waste time applying 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.610
 enamel and how I did it with pigment 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.770
 if they are going to make pigments girls 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.080
 look for the primary colors red 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.940
 yellow and blue that are where they come from 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.240
 all the tones from there you can make a 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.010
 lots of different but then if after 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.770
 also how nice when they meet 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:47.740
 one the pigments and the exact color 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.660
 what are you looking for but always armense 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.190
 the primary colors and well this is one 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.140
 of the pigments that I have for 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.860
 a lot of yellow so that's why I do not 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.330
 It hurt my elbow to make me the complete set if 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.460
 they want to work with him 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.310
 acrylic and because they do not have the enamel or 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.350
 So use a thin capita 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.380
 crystal acrylic down like this 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.960
 they waste so much product 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.840
 this pigment is very strong I had to 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:16.390
 use different monomers when forming 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.660
 the translucent nail because the other 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:22.240
 monomer was yellow so strong 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.190
 good and we passed another part that is limar 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.530
 and polish quickie I will comment 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:30.400
 among the questions that most make me is 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:33.910
 about how not to grind and polish tricks 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.640
 the nails build well and no longer file 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.280
 there are people who work that way differently 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.690
 I'll tell you what I think about that 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.660
 the electric day for me is a 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:46.150
 blessing is a way to shorten the 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:49.470
 time and hurt you - the doll at 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:53.020
 being sent by hand is a tool 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.810
 sensational and he did not polish and polish 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.640
 a client's nails to me it makes me 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.880
 it is a crime 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.640
 this work you will always notice 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.300
 that a job that was filed and 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:09.190
 polishing looks better than a job that does not 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.320
 and this to me is not me give quality to 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.290
 our clients have to file and there 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.430
 that polish the masters plus mops and 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.349
 manipulate 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.000
 Well, I'm going to work on three of those 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:21.680
 are some of the tones I'm going to use 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.480
 not all use 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.829
 I showed you there are a lot of acrylics 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.219
 but not all of you here I'm doing 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:31.579
 the flower is for example nuances with the 

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:33.319
 red yellow and red color but as they 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:35.840
 I showed at the beginning and while I was 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:37.939
 talking about what the limado also use 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.090
 acrylic paintings look here I'm going to 

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:43.310
 form this green pistil but after a while 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.650
 I'm going to add a coffee tone because 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.709
 actually the pistil I wanted it to 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.629
 outside coffee I did not have acrylic coffee shot 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:53.569
 Form them any color of all 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:55.760
 I'm going to paint it and that's how they form 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:59.069
 different flowers that look like this 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:02.040
 those Hawaiian flowers 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:05.430
 some here and others there and already 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:08.310
 now let's work with painting I'm going to 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.079
 make a kind of twigs like that 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.290
 very simple you do not need to be a 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:15.840
 freehand master or anything like this 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:19.739
 anyone can do these little touches 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.419
 ok the brush is from ebay very cheap and not 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.710
 believe that I like it because they are being 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.710
 separating the hairs 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:32.690
 they are going to realize that work 3d with 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.850
 Acrylic paintings is another thing you see 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.520
 much better and really nothing more 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:41.060
 they are staining the acrylic if they are fixed 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:44.630
 there I am after using the 3d brush 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:47.150
 with monomer and washed all the colors 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.250
 so the flowers are stained 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:52.250
 after having placed coffee around here 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:56.210
 over there and that gives a different turn to 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:58.850
 what is the 3d already changes everything and you see 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:01.400
 more professional try to qualify 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:04.130
 only with pure acrylic this is 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:07.580
 much more complicated in painting 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:11.240
 acrylic because you are already aware 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:14.050
 painting no no definitely not a 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:16.599
 drastic change the third dimension 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:19.300
 After that, I just added pebbles 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:20.379
 as they saw he applied the ultraviolet gel and 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.599
 ready 

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:24.159
 but this set has been to your liking to 

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:26.470
 I would leave if they change it 

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:30.250
 green color was also going to look like this 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:33.759
 nice pretty green mexico so if I 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:35.319
 they try to share it with me and it's all I hope 

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:37.750
 you also make them easy to 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:40.539
 do it I am I send them a hug and 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:42.690
 until next time with another video 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:42.690
 bye
