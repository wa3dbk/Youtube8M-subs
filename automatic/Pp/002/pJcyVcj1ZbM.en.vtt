00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:11.580
 good afternoon dear channel viewers 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.950
 plants to 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.890
 today we are so sad 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.710
 topic you all saw our screaming korea in 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.949
 she was beautiful in previous videos 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.869
 she was fluffy cool with us 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.050
 lowered enough temperature 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:31.320
 premises and now it is gradually 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.960
 starts to turn into withering and 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.809
 plant we could not understand why it 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.550
 happening and now with you we 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.690
 let's try to diagnose her 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:45.660
 the fact that there are no pests on the foliage 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.270
 exactly why most likely reasons 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.940
 will be in the root system and now we 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.070
 just turn it out of the pot and check it out. 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.949
 its root 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.690
 after that we just transplant it for 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.280
 so that in this pot she does not 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.090
 returned and let's hope that 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.320
 new place 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.320
 she is much better than a year 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.880
 well as you see 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.040
 root system and and there was enough in 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.640
 this pot is depressed 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:25.909
 and in the new land in which her someone 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.740
 once transplanted somewhere root not 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:31.479
 went 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.479
 apparently the earth was very dense 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.460
 there was a closure coma 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.010
 so that the earth is on top all the time 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.200
 dried up 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.210
 and I watered plants quite rarely 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:48.560
 because our water is cold 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:51.830
 accumulated in the bottom of the pot and you 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.500
 You see what happens every time I their 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:57.740
 rollers say that never 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:03.280
 hammer in the plant right now we see 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:06.350
 clearly what happens from the overflow 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.800
 from the closure of the root system although I have it 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:12.440
 water three times a week 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.930
 she didn't drink the plant 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:18.080
 but firstly considering the size of the rooms and 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.930
 the size of araucaria itself is down the size of my 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:24.110
 you yourself are well aware and drinkers 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.720
 sucking roots feed a little spoiled 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.920
 apparently it came to us already in 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:33.530
 this state is just gradually she 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:36.620
 started to die and we kind of thought 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:40.220
 that i'm just bad now we will transplant 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.150
 her in ordinary land in a universal but 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.989
 before i handled 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:49.400
 basement all her now I'm abs and plus 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:55.819
 a little bit of powder 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.819
 foundation of the whole root system 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:08.260
 foundation is also very good treatment 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:10.329
 so let's hope to waste her 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.360
 as you can see she grew up in a very 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:16.090
 some little pot root 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:19.239
 formed clearly on it then it was 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:22.180
 just transferred but the counter is bigger but 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:24.189
 it did not help her and now we will 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.709
 just pray to god for her to go 

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:30.489
 grow as you see the lower branches of it 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:36.010
 have dried up we will still count 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:37.780
 the fact that we are from the promise we specifically 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.659
 picked up a big pot well like a doga 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.079
 yourself root level just so big 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:43.950
 pot 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:43.950
 us below 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:25.280
 I planted June deeply 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:25.280
 so that the root can be ventilated 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:36.289
 we will hope that she will like it 

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:41.360
 that she was transplanted and now the most 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:45.180
 tragic moment in it all i'll take away 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:48.180
 dry parts of branches 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.180
 this 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:56.680
 the land at the time of transplant was raw 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:05:00.910
 so I will not water as you saw 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:04.300
 the root system was in enough 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:06.120
 wet state so water is there 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:10.590
 enough 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.590
 does not want nothing special 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:19.980
 I have left these branches for now, I understand that 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:19.980
 they get drunk but again really want 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:37.990
 loved her after 23 days 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.990
 compaq on defusing 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:45.320
 and now just do it there is such a 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:47.580
 here we have our surgery 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:51.659
 resuscitation 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:54.030
 Now just have to wait just 

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:56.159
 spring is coming soon and we hope that 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:58.490
 our araucaria feel better after 

00:05:56.159 --> 00:06:02.520
 foundation and transplant treatments 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:04.830
 still we removed the wet shaded 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:07.199
 land removed part 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:10.379
 rotted root and processed all 

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:12.030
 foundationol besides observing 

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:13.979
 so many people and mine too 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:15.900
 foundationol is a little bit 

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:19.979
 growth stimulator, I still will 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:23.150
 hope that it is easier for all the best 

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:23.150
