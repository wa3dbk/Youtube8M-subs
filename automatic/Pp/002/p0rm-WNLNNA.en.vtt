one<00:02:34.130> of<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:34.310> reasons<00:02:34.670> is<00:02:34.790> because<00:02:34.820> you<00:02:35.660> always

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
one of the reasons is because you always

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.980 
one of the reasons is because you always
have<00:02:36.350> those<00:02:36.500> around<00:02:36.830> the<00:02:37.310> CR<00:02:37.780> batteries<00:02:38.780> that

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
have those around the CR batteries that

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.640 
have those around the CR batteries that
most<00:02:39.500> LED<00:02:40.060> lights<00:02:41.060> use<00:02:41.420> most<00:02:41.930> tack<00:02:42.200> lights<00:02:42.440> are

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
lux Pro and look at that look at the

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.380 
lux Pro and look at that look at the
difference<00:03:53.840> this<00:03:54.350> is<00:03:54.560> the<00:03:54.769> lux<00:03:55.130> Pro<00:03:55.489> to<00:03:56.150> see

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
difference this is the lux Pro to see

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.410 
difference this is the lux Pro to see
how<00:03:56.510> the<00:03:56.570> colors<00:03:57.170> are<00:03:57.320> so<00:03:57.590> rich<00:03:58.269> because<00:03:59.269> it's

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
how the colors are so rich because it's

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.390 
how the colors are so rich because it's
such<00:03:59.600> a<00:03:59.630> bright<00:03:59.989> light<00:04:00.260> and<00:04:00.560> I'm<00:04:01.130> gonna<00:04:01.250> be

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
such a bright light and I'm gonna be

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.550 
such a bright light and I'm gonna be
switching<00:04:01.820> the<00:04:02.000> different<00:04:02.360> modes<00:04:02.600> now<00:04:02.840> let's

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
switching the different modes now let's

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.310 
switching the different modes now let's
get<00:04:03.709> the<00:04:03.830> focus<00:04:04.040> back<00:04:04.190> on<00:04:04.580> here<00:04:06.400> come<00:04:07.400> on

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
get the focus back on here come on

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.770 
get the focus back on here come on
so<00:04:09.320> if<00:04:09.590> I<00:04:09.799> just<00:04:10.070> have<00:04:10.310> hit<00:04:10.880> it<00:04:11.060> that<00:04:11.299> puts<00:04:11.570> it<00:04:11.660> on

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
so if I just have hit it that puts it on

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.410 
so if I just have hit it that puts it on
medium<00:04:12.019> mode<00:04:12.440> if<00:04:12.680> I<00:04:13.310> have<00:04:13.610> hit<00:04:13.850> it<00:04:13.970> again<00:04:14.239> that

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
medium mode if I have hit it again that

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.719 
medium mode if I have hit it again that
puts<00:04:14.600> it<00:04:14.690> on<00:04:14.780> low<00:04:14.989> mode<00:04:15.230> if<00:04:15.470> I<00:04:16.070> have<00:04:16.340> hit<00:04:16.579> it

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729
