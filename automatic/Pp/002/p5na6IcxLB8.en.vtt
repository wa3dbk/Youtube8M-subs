00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 are now several months that the project 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.370
 xd mom nintendo is almost on the lips 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.889
 all for those who do not know and are 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.990
 very few probably what 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.650
 we are saying right now when 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.150
 let's talk about this project of the project 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:21.029
 nx is nothing but the code name 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.980
 precisely the new console still in 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.980
 nintendo design phase 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.560
 initially when this note came out 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.960
 this rumor was talked about without it 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.420
 be sure one hundred percent that yes 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.399
 it was something that is not true 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.260
 however, the confirmation was delayed 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.930
 by the same Japanese company 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.579
 that during a press conference he has 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.690
 revealed that the code name 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:51.629
 of the new console and its own project nx 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.850
 and here is that together and after confirmation 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.969
 by the Japanese the 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.449
 most interesting rumor ride anymore 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.910
 intriguing and that generates more links 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.339
 currently we know very little or nothing 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.560
 about the new Japanese product but 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.479
 lately precisely in the last ones 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.790
 days the most interesting news is 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.640
 arrived from the famous forum of 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.009
 neogaf where a user has revealed 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.400
 certain information on the alleged 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.860
 project even patent filed by 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.780
 nintendo in the united states and such 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.049
 patent or would have as a protagonist 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.299
 just the project nx going to reveal 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.000
 some characteristics that will have just this 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.740
 console a console really very much 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.900
 waiting because his job will be that 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.659
 to heal at least from the point of view 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.150
 of the home consoles the net gap on 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.119
 net gap that is currently between will 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.280
 you play station 4 and xbox one and in that 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.500
 I would say that one of the things more 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.130
 important we need hardware 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.259
 that somehow you try to heal 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.780
 precisely this is a clear gap and far 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.820
 return interest from third parties 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.840
 therefore parts of the developers like 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.270
 electronic art 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.850
 ubisoft et cetera et cetera verse 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.509
 mom's home-made fixed consoles 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.700
 nintendo 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.950
 but back to the subject patent 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.020
 main of this video where it emerges 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.110
 which apparently apparently there 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.780
 console will not present in any way a 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.400
 reader the exemplified system is not 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.260
 equipped with a disc reader for 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.980
 read programs or data from media 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.780
 physical 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.569
 in short, apparently as seen also 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.910
 in the last video it is fashionable to hypothesize 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:33.030
 for the future of consoles exempt from 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.280
 readers then download only or something 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.250
 of the kind one speaks besides obviously 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.569
 I would say an internal hard drive for 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.569
 store both game data and i 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:44.610
 games themselves of elsie etc. and so on 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.519
 in short, any kind of data now 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.069
 based on this rumor I would say that 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:53.370
 roads that nintendo can take in 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:55.799
 this sense is definitely a few two 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:59.220
 to be precise the first one and it is also 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:01.739
 the one I think would be less concrete 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.610
 the Japanese consul take advantage of the 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.900
 maximum digital market making 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.060
 in fact removing the possibility completely 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.360
 to buy physical games then 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.489
 focusing resources and time on the store 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.680
 digital and forcing users to 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.510
 download games connections 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.389
 allowing a hypothesis as I have 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:24.329
 very early very unlikely 

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:27.120
 since nintendo has never been 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:29.880
 famous for betting on the online and 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.319
 consequence to the user who uses the 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.480
 nintendo console 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.700
 according to me he doesn't even know it 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.950
 much to be honest it is not the target 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.780
 ideal unlike perhaps that of 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.850
 xbox or year playstation 4 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.340
 the second hypothesis and it is also the one more 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:47.730
 probable even if it jars a little in 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:51.060
 2015 and that nx mounts a reader of 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:53.130
 cartridges take cartridges thus making the 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.290
 perfect console for cross plain 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:58.079
 using the cartridges is on the 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.120
 console on the controller or second 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:02.600
 portable console and obviously on 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.730
 nintendo 3ds 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.380
 having said that he is well aware that yes 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.930
 deals exclusively with 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:12.390
 I would say that Nintendo has no talk 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.820
 currently need a new console 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.500
 neither now nor in 2016 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.209
 although it has been confirmed that 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.330
 new console will come out of the idea 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.690
 that they should take full advantage of yet 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.250
 wii u 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.050
 because despite the very beginning 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.910
 crunchy is a little bit recovery 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.430
 especially in the last two years with 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.140
 friends and exclusives and you what 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.210
 think of what we talked about 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.850
 today you would like a console 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:38.220
 in retro style able to read 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:40.320
 cartridges or not or regarding 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.600
 the other hypothesis is a silk console 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:46.680
 lolli surely nintendo is ready for 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:48.570
 a great and important turning point 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.730
 we'll see as usual vi 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.470
 thank you for following me in this 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:54.240

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.010

 Hello
