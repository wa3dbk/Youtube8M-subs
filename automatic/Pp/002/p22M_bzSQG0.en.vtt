we've<00:00:02.020> seen<00:00:02.260> a<00:00:02.320> dramatic<00:00:03.100> difference<00:00:03.250> in<00:00:03.580> the

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:03.639 
we've seen a dramatic difference in the

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:04.620 
we've seen a dramatic difference in the
house

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:04.630 
house

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:06.809 
house
and<00:00:05.020> we<00:00:05.170> can<00:00:05.410> attribute<00:00:05.830> that<00:00:06.189> to<00:00:06.250> the<00:00:06.580> LOI

00:00:06.809 --> 00:00:06.819 
and we can attribute that to the LOI

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:09.900 
and we can attribute that to the LOI
product<00:00:07.569> because<00:00:08.290> it<00:00:08.559> does<00:00:08.889> not<00:00:09.040> heat<00:00:09.400> up<00:00:09.640> or

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:09.910 
product because it does not heat up or

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.360 
product because it does not heat up or
it<00:00:10.060> does<00:00:10.210> not<00:00:10.420> get<00:00:10.630> as<00:00:10.840> cold<00:00:11.170> as<00:00:11.350> it<00:00:11.380> used<00:00:11.710> to<00:00:11.800> in

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:12.370 
it does not get as cold as it used to in

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:14.850 
it does not get as cold as it used to in
a<00:00:12.550> dramatic<00:00:13.210> way<00:00:13.420> now<00:00:13.900> we<00:00:13.960> move<00:00:14.260> back<00:00:14.500> in<00:00:14.740> in

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:14.860 
a dramatic way now we move back in in

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.819 
a dramatic way now we move back in in
October<00:00:15.010> of<00:00:15.820> just<00:00:16.689> last<00:00:16.869> year<00:00:17.109> it<00:00:17.289> just<00:00:17.619> last

00:00:17.819 --> 00:00:17.829 
October of just last year it just last

00:00:17.829 --> 00:00:20.729 
October of just last year it just last
fall<00:00:18.039> and<00:00:18.220> we<00:00:19.089> did<00:00:19.300> not<00:00:19.509> literally<00:00:20.199> we<00:00:20.439> did<00:00:20.589> not

00:00:20.729 --> 00:00:20.739 
fall and we did not literally we did not

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:23.579 
fall and we did not literally we did not
turn<00:00:21.039> the<00:00:21.249> heat<00:00:21.429> on<00:00:21.460> all<00:00:21.880> winter<00:00:21.939> long<00:00:22.720> now<00:00:23.560> you

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:23.589 
turn the heat on all winter long now you

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:24.960 
turn the heat on all winter long now you
know<00:00:23.949> it's<00:00:24.099> somewhat<00:00:24.519> of<00:00:24.550> a<00:00:24.669> temporary

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:24.970 
know it's somewhat of a temporary

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.939 
know it's somewhat of a temporary
climate<00:00:25.329> here<00:00:25.419> in<00:00:25.539> San<00:00:25.720> Diego<00:00:25.749> of<00:00:26.140> course<00:00:26.409> but

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:26.949 
climate here in San Diego of course but

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:29.309 
climate here in San Diego of course but
still<00:00:26.980> that's<00:00:27.699> you<00:00:28.239> know<00:00:28.329> quite<00:00:28.689> a<00:00:28.720> testament

00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:29.319 
still that's you know quite a testament

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:31.950 
still that's you know quite a testament
to<00:00:30.039> realize<00:00:30.429> that<00:00:30.789> we<00:00:30.999> never<00:00:31.359> turn<00:00:31.630> the<00:00:31.779> heat

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960 
to realize that we never turn the heat

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.189 
to realize that we never turn the heat
on<00:00:31.989> and<00:00:32.439> it<00:00:32.590> never<00:00:32.770> got<00:00:32.920> below<00:00:33.280> 65<00:00:33.730> degrees<00:00:34.269> in

00:00:35.189 --> 00:00:35.199 
on and it never got below 65 degrees in

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:37.380 
on and it never got below 65 degrees in
the<00:00:35.350> house<00:00:35.530> we<00:00:35.859> saved<00:00:36.219> a<00:00:36.370> tremendous<00:00:37.090> amount

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
the house we saved a tremendous amount

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.319 
the house we saved a tremendous amount
of<00:00:37.449> money<00:00:37.739> not<00:00:38.739> turning<00:00:39.340> on<00:00:39.429> that<00:00:39.460> heat<00:00:39.820> also

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:40.329 
of money not turning on that heat also

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:42.990 
of money not turning on that heat also
all<00:00:40.570> winter<00:00:40.780> long<00:00:40.870> and<00:00:41.320> now<00:00:41.679> we've<00:00:42.280> kind<00:00:42.910> of

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000 
all winter long and now we've kind of

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.580 
all winter long and now we've kind of
moving<00:00:43.179> into<00:00:43.359> the<00:00:43.480> summer<00:00:43.660> season<00:00:43.899> even<00:00:44.230> today

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:44.590 
moving into the summer season even today

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.020 
moving into the summer season even today
it's<00:00:44.800> kind<00:00:44.980> of<00:00:45.010> a<00:00:45.100> warm<00:00:45.309> day<00:00:45.460> outside<00:00:45.760> and<00:00:45.969> you

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
it's kind of a warm day outside and you

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.939 
it's kind of a warm day outside and you
could<00:00:46.120> feel<00:00:46.329> this<00:00:46.480> dramatically<00:00:47.109> cooler<00:00:47.589> in

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:47.949 
could feel this dramatically cooler in

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:50.099 
could feel this dramatically cooler in
here<00:00:48.339> with<00:00:48.760> the<00:00:48.879> low<00:00:49.030> e<00:00:49.059> product<00:00:49.660> and<00:00:49.839> the<00:00:49.929> way

00:00:50.099 --> 00:00:50.109 
here with the low e product and the way

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:52.709 
here with the low e product and the way
that<00:00:50.379> it's<00:00:50.589> positioned<00:00:51.010> is<00:00:51.550> far<00:00:52.300> to<00:00:52.600> the

00:00:52.709 --> 00:00:52.719 
that it's positioned is far to the

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:54.119 
that it's positioned is far to the
outside<00:00:52.749> of<00:00:53.440> what<00:00:53.620> we<00:00:53.710> call<00:00:53.859> the<00:00:53.949> building

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:54.129 
outside of what we call the building

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:56.400 
outside of what we call the building
envelope<00:00:54.429> as<00:00:54.760> possible<00:00:55.300> it's<00:00:55.780> reflecting

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
envelope as possible it's reflecting

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:57.959 
envelope as possible it's reflecting
that<00:00:56.530> heat<00:00:56.800> before<00:00:57.219> it's<00:00:57.339> actually<00:00:57.640> getting

00:00:57.959 --> 00:00:57.969 
that heat before it's actually getting

00:00:57.969 --> 00:00:59.549 
that heat before it's actually getting
into<00:00:58.120> the<00:00:58.239> structure<00:00:58.749> because<00:00:59.289> what<00:00:59.469> will

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
into the structure because what will

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.709 
into the structure because what will
happen<00:00:59.890> with<00:01:00.039> typical<00:01:00.429> insulation<00:01:00.969> is<00:01:01.120> it'll

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:01.719 
happen with typical insulation is it'll

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:03.299 
happen with typical insulation is it'll
the<00:01:02.109> heat<00:01:02.350> will<00:01:02.499> get<00:01:02.620> into<00:01:02.890> the<00:01:03.010> structure

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
the heat will get into the structure

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:05.070 
the heat will get into the structure
it'll<00:01:03.699> start<00:01:03.940> to<00:01:03.969> warm<00:01:04.269> up<00:01:04.510> and<00:01:04.750> then<00:01:04.870> that

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
it'll start to warm up and then that

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.920 
it'll start to warm up and then that
insulation<00:01:05.830> is<00:01:06.100> trying<00:01:06.340> to<00:01:06.460> combat<00:01:07.030> the<00:01:07.690> heat

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
insulation is trying to combat the heat

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.780 
insulation is trying to combat the heat
gain<00:01:08.200> and<00:01:08.230> it<00:01:08.650> just<00:01:08.920> can't<00:01:09.130> keep<00:01:09.220> up<00:01:09.520> with<00:01:09.670> it

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
gain and it just can't keep up with it

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.220 
gain and it just can't keep up with it
so<00:01:09.820> with<00:01:10.090> this<00:01:10.210> low<00:01:10.390> e<00:01:10.420> product<00:01:10.930> it<00:01:11.050> kind<00:01:11.200> of

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:11.230 
so with this low e product it kind of

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.410 
so with this low e product it kind of
reflects<00:01:11.620> it<00:01:11.800> and<00:01:11.950> so<00:01:12.640> that<00:01:12.790> it<00:01:12.940> doesn't<00:01:13.240> heat

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
reflects it and so that it doesn't heat

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.600 
reflects it and so that it doesn't heat
up<00:01:13.450> or<00:01:13.780> it<00:01:14.080> doesn't<00:01:14.500> lose<00:01:14.830> the<00:01:14.890> heat<00:01:15.310> that's<00:01:15.430> in

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
up or it doesn't lose the heat that's in

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.340 
up or it doesn't lose the heat that's in
here<00:01:15.760> in<00:01:15.820> the<00:01:15.910> wintertime<00:01:16.150> and<00:01:16.510> it<00:01:16.990> just<00:01:17.170> works

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
here in the wintertime and it just works

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.650 
here in the wintertime and it just works
very<00:01:17.710> very<00:01:17.800> well<00:01:18.040> throughout<00:01:18.940> the<00:01:19.120> home<00:01:19.270> we

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:19.660 
very very well throughout the home we

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.500 
very very well throughout the home we
have<00:01:19.900> done<00:01:20.320> it<00:01:20.500> a<00:01:20.530> complete<00:01:21.520> rap<00:01:21.910> if<00:01:22.180> you<00:01:22.300> could

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:22.510 
have done it a complete rap if you could

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.180 
have done it a complete rap if you could
just<00:01:22.660> imagine<00:01:22.930> it<00:01:23.350> was<00:01:23.500> it<00:01:23.740> looked<00:01:23.920> like<00:01:24.070> this

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
just imagine it was it looked like this

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.860 
just imagine it was it looked like this
big<00:01:24.460> silver<00:01:24.760> spaceship<00:01:25.330> in<00:01:25.450> the<00:01:25.480> beginning

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:25.870 
big silver spaceship in the beginning

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.420 
big silver spaceship in the beginning
because<00:01:26.080> it<00:01:26.200> was<00:01:26.290> on<00:01:26.470> the<00:01:26.500> walls<00:01:26.800> it<00:01:27.160> was<00:01:27.280> on

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
because it was on the walls it was on

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.880 
because it was on the walls it was on
the<00:01:27.550> roof<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:29.020> then<00:01:29.350> you<00:01:29.530> know<00:01:29.620> we've<00:01:29.770> gone

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
the roof and then you know we've gone

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.380 
the roof and then you know we've gone
back<00:01:30.160> in<00:01:30.190> and<00:01:30.580> we've<00:01:30.670> added<00:01:30.820> additional

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
back in and we've added additional

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.190 
back in and we've added additional
layering<00:01:32.200> inside<00:01:32.650> too<00:01:33.330> you<00:01:34.330> know<00:01:34.480> slow<00:01:35.020> down

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
layering inside too you know slow down

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.260 
layering inside too you know slow down
even<00:01:35.410> more<00:01:35.770> of<00:01:35.950> that<00:01:35.980> heat<00:01:36.640> gain<00:01:36.820> or<00:01:36.940> that<00:01:37.090> heat

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
even more of that heat gain or that heat
