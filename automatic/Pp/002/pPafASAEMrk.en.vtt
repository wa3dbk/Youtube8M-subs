00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.819 
I think the thing that immediately
struck<00:01:34.689> me<00:01:34.869> about<00:01:34.990> the<00:01:35.229> school<00:01:35.500> was<00:01:35.799> the

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:35.829 
struck me about the school was the

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:38.310 
struck me about the school was the
commitment<00:01:36.610> to<00:01:36.790> outward<00:01:37.240> bound<00:01:37.479> and<00:01:37.840> the

commitment to outward bound and the

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.469

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
principles of servant leadership and

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.780 
principles of servant leadership and
then<00:01:41.020> you<00:01:41.110> pair<00:01:41.350> that<00:01:41.380> with<00:01:41.590> the<00:01:41.770> ia<00:01:42.220> teachers

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
then you pair that with the ia teachers

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.039

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
expeditionary learning and to me is

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:55.859 
expeditionary learning and to me is
learning<00:01:52.360> like<00:01:53.049> through<00:01:53.320> questioning<00:01:54.869> taking

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
learning like through questioning taking

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:57.810 
learning like through questioning taking
one<00:01:56.110> topic<00:01:56.560> and<00:01:56.710> going<00:01:56.890> really<00:01:57.100> really<00:01:57.580> deep

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
one topic and going really really deep

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.999 
one topic and going really really deep
instead<00:01:58.299> of<00:01:58.390> covering<00:01:58.630> multiple<00:01:59.320> topics<00:01:59.500> you

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
instead of covering multiple topics you

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:02.490 
instead of covering multiple topics you
can<00:02:00.159> get<00:02:00.369> a<00:02:00.670> little<00:02:01.090> bit<00:02:01.210> better<00:02:01.360> at<00:02:01.929> reading

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
can get a little bit better at reading

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.139 
can get a little bit better at reading
writing<00:02:02.860> and<00:02:03.009> math<00:02:03.250> when<00:02:03.610> you're<00:02:03.729> doing<00:02:03.970> it<00:02:04.090> in

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
writing and math when you're doing it in

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:06.270 
writing and math when you're doing it in
a<00:02:04.210> really<00:02:04.539> deep<00:02:04.810> meaningful<00:02:05.440> way<00:02:05.590> I'm<00:02:06.159> not

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
a really deep meaningful way I'm not

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.960 
a really deep meaningful way I'm not
like<00:02:06.600> school<00:02:07.600> it's<00:02:08.470> more<00:02:08.649> like<00:02:08.799> yes<00:02:09.160> some<00:02:09.880> of

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
like school it's more like yes some of

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.940 
like school it's more like yes some of
those<00:02:10.060> schools<00:02:10.390> go<00:02:10.720> learn<00:02:10.959> I<00:02:11.319> think<00:02:11.530> the

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
those schools go learn I think the

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.979 
those schools go learn I think the
biggest<00:02:12.190> impact<00:02:12.760> that<00:02:12.850> I've<00:02:13.060> seen<00:02:13.330> in<00:02:13.480> my<00:02:13.660> kids

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
biggest impact that I've seen in my kids

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.039 
biggest impact that I've seen in my kids
is<00:02:14.290> that<00:02:14.319> the<00:02:14.620> school<00:02:14.950> and<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:16.330> the<00:02:16.630> program

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:17.049 
is that the school and the the program

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:19.170 
is that the school and the the program
the<00:02:17.380> expeditionary<00:02:18.100> learning<00:02:18.160> program<00:02:18.940> and

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
the expeditionary learning program and

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.000 
the expeditionary learning program and
the<00:02:19.239> outward<00:02:19.390> bound<00:02:19.750> program<00:02:20.080> really<00:02:20.530> teach

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
the outward bound program really teach

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.640 
the outward bound program really teach
to<00:02:21.489> the<00:02:21.760> whole<00:02:21.970> individual<00:02:22.569> I<00:02:22.840> noticed<00:02:23.380> here

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
to the whole individual I noticed here

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.770 
to the whole individual I noticed here
she<00:02:23.920> just<00:02:23.950> she<00:02:24.760> was<00:02:24.850> flourished<00:02:25.269> she<00:02:25.450> became

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
she just she was flourished she became

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.009 
she just she was flourished she became
alive<00:02:26.049> again<00:02:26.410> and<00:02:27.360> especially<00:02:28.360> in<00:02:28.660> the<00:02:28.750> area

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
alive again and especially in the area

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:30.660 
alive again and especially in the area
of<00:02:29.080> reading<00:02:29.350> which<00:02:29.680> she<00:02:29.950> had<00:02:30.130> become<00:02:30.280> very

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
of reading which she had become very

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.699 
of reading which she had become very
discouraged<00:02:31.299> in<00:02:31.540> but<00:02:31.959> here<00:02:32.110> we<00:02:32.290> want<00:02:32.620> to

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
discouraged in but here we want to

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.530 
discouraged in but here we want to
expand<00:02:33.610> them<00:02:33.760> out<00:02:33.849> of<00:02:33.940> their<00:02:34.030> comfort<00:02:34.209> zone

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
expand them out of their comfort zone

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.300 
expand them out of their comfort zone
and<00:02:34.720> see<00:02:35.319> what<00:02:35.470> they<00:02:35.590> could<00:02:35.650> learn<00:02:35.890> from<00:02:36.130> that

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
and see what they could learn from that

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.009 
and see what they could learn from that
and<00:02:36.430> where<00:02:36.580> they<00:02:36.670> can<00:02:36.820> grow<00:02:37.000> and<00:02:37.420> so<00:02:37.840> our

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
and where they can grow and so our

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:39.900 
and where they can grow and so our
adventure<00:02:38.290> education<00:02:38.560> program<00:02:39.370> is<00:02:39.549> for<00:02:39.790> the

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
adventure education program is for the

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.240 
adventure education program is for the
purpose<00:02:40.299> of<00:02:40.500> self-discovery<00:02:41.500> and<00:02:41.769> personal

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
purpose of self-discovery and personal

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.190 
purpose of self-discovery and personal
growth<00:02:42.400> they<00:02:43.000> approach<00:02:43.359> it<00:02:43.390> in<00:02:43.630> a<00:02:43.720> way<00:02:43.750> that

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
growth they approach it in a way that

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.140 
growth they approach it in a way that
more<00:02:44.410> allows<00:02:44.680> you<00:02:44.980> to<00:02:45.130> do<00:02:45.280> more<00:02:45.459> than<00:02:45.760> being

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
more allows you to do more than being

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.330 
more allows you to do more than being
told<00:02:46.450> what<00:02:46.660> you're<00:02:46.780> supposed<00:02:47.109> to<00:02:47.170> do<00:02:47.350> and<00:02:47.769> kids

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
told what you're supposed to do and kids

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.569 
told what you're supposed to do and kids
remember<00:02:48.820> it<00:02:48.940> when<00:02:49.209> they<00:02:49.560> discover<00:02:50.579> something

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:51.579 
remember it when they discover something

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:53.610 
remember it when they discover something
about<00:02:51.910> themselves<00:02:52.120> or<00:02:52.630> something<00:02:53.410> about<00:02:53.500> the

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
about themselves or something about the

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.510 
about themselves or something about the
world<00:02:53.859> on<00:02:54.220> their<00:02:54.370> own

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
world on their own

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.250 
world on their own
that's<00:02:56.330> why<00:02:56.450> we<00:02:56.600> have<00:02:56.690> that<00:02:56.810> quote<00:02:56.990> on<00:02:57.170> the

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
that's why we have that quote on the

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.840 
that's why we have that quote on the
wall<00:02:57.440> that<00:02:57.470> says<00:02:57.980> you<00:02:58.340> have<00:02:58.370> to<00:02:58.580> have<00:02:58.820> a

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
wall that says you have to have a

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.670 
wall that says you have to have a
relationship<00:02:59.480> before<00:02:59.960> any<00:03:00.170> learning<00:03:00.500> can

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
relationship before any learning can

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.430 
relationship before any learning can
occur<00:03:01.030> but<00:03:02.030> once<00:03:02.240> that<00:03:02.450> happens<00:03:02.900> then<00:03:03.110> we<00:03:03.290> have

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
occur but once that happens then we have

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.470 
occur but once that happens then we have
some<00:03:03.650> incredible<00:03:03.800> learning<00:03:04.610> experiences

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
some incredible learning experiences

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.300 
some incredible learning experiences
here<00:03:05.750> and<00:03:05.960> I<00:03:06.350> think<00:03:06.440> they<00:03:06.770> look<00:03:07.010> really

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
here and I think they look really

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.770 
here and I think they look really
different<00:03:07.580> than<00:03:08.000> they<00:03:08.180> do<00:03:08.240> in<00:03:08.360> a<00:03:08.570> lot<00:03:08.750> of

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
different than they do in a lot of

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.700 
different than they do in a lot of
settings<00:03:10.210> when<00:03:11.210> we're<00:03:11.840> doing<00:03:12.140> a<00:03:12.350> drum<00:03:12.530> circle

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:12.710 
settings when we're doing a drum circle

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.810 
settings when we're doing a drum circle
I<00:03:13.070> think<00:03:13.310> of<00:03:13.490> it<00:03:13.640> as<00:03:13.850> like<00:03:14.600> a<00:03:15.380> conversation<00:03:16.370> you

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
I think of it as like a conversation you

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.380 
I think of it as like a conversation you
see<00:03:17.030> team<00:03:17.330> and<00:03:17.570> you<00:03:18.140> see<00:03:18.380> collaboration

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
see team and you see collaboration

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.320 
see team and you see collaboration
the<00:03:20.990> big<00:03:21.170> picture<00:03:21.650> is<00:03:21.890> community<00:03:22.850> and<00:03:23.060> it's

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
the big picture is community and it's

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.500 
the big picture is community and it's
about<00:03:23.600> creating<00:03:24.140> a<00:03:24.290> culture<00:03:25.090> people<00:03:26.090> who<00:03:26.360> are

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
about creating a culture people who are

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.350 
about creating a culture people who are
connected<00:03:27.110> it's<00:03:27.560> very<00:03:27.770> rare<00:03:28.070> CEA's<00:03:28.820> entire
