accept this you've set and muted you can

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.520 
accept this you've set and muted you can
undo<00:03:02.760> commutative<00:03:03.359> that's<00:03:03.629> something<00:03:03.989> so

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
undo commutative that's something so

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.670

down<00:03:05.519> here<00:03:05.819> what<00:03:05.939> you<00:03:06.000> can<00:03:06.030> see<00:03:06.180> is<00:03:06.480> you<00:03:07.019> can<00:03:07.260> do

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
down here what you can see is you can do

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.009 
down here what you can see is you can do
you<00:03:07.769> select<00:03:07.950> my<00:03:08.220> parts<00:03:08.459> are<00:03:08.519> visible<00:03:08.879> so<00:03:09.720> like

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
you select my parts are visible so like

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.099 
you select my parts are visible so like
it's<00:03:10.290> all<00:03:10.439> gone<00:03:10.620> now<00:03:10.650> head<00:03:11.129> body<00:03:11.939> leg<00:03:12.840> one<00:03:13.079> leg

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
it's all gone now head body leg one leg

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:16.789 
it's all gone now head body leg one leg
two<00:03:13.500> leg<00:03:13.739> three<00:03:13.980> like<00:03:14.129> four<00:03:15.470> that<00:03:16.470> makes<00:03:16.650> it

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
two leg three like four that makes it

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:19.309 
two leg three like four that makes it
easier<00:03:17.129> to<00:03:17.160> edit<00:03:17.489> it<00:03:17.989> yeah<00:03:18.989> that's<00:03:19.139> pretty

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
easier to edit it yeah that's pretty

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:22.309 
easier to edit it yeah that's pretty
much<00:03:19.440> it<00:03:19.639> then<00:03:20.639> you<00:03:21.209> can<00:03:21.359> change<00:03:21.599> the<00:03:21.780> pixels

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
much it then you can change the pixels

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:26.119 
much it then you can change the pixels
so<00:03:22.669> it<00:03:23.669> becomes<00:03:24.060> even<00:03:24.239> more<00:03:24.829> hi-def<00:03:25.829> if<00:03:26.040> you

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:26.129 
so it becomes even more hi-def if you

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:28.580 
so it becomes even more hi-def if you
want<00:03:26.310> to<00:03:26.370> call<00:03:26.519> it<00:03:26.639> that<00:03:26.669> or<00:03:27.480> less<00:03:27.750> look<00:03:28.470> at

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
want to call it that or less look at

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.659 
want to call it that or less look at
that<00:03:28.739> that<00:03:29.340> is<00:03:29.549> hilarious<00:03:29.819> let's<00:03:30.209> fail<00:03:31.669> 32

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:32.669 
that that is hilarious let's fail 32

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:36.770

right 6 16 64 by 32 I think I've
permanently<00:03:37.290> ruined<00:03:37.590> it<00:03:37.680> now

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859

oh yeah now it just kind of looks like a

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.039 
oh yeah now it just kind of looks like a
blob<00:03:40.530> that<00:03:40.799> doesn't<00:03:41.069> really<00:03:41.190> matter<00:03:41.720> so<00:03:42.720> down

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
blob that doesn't really matter so down

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:44.390 
blob that doesn't really matter so down
here<00:03:43.229> is<00:03:43.349> the<00:03:43.470> same<00:03:43.650> as<00:03:43.680> on<00:03:43.919> the<00:03:43.949> other<00:03:44.040> ones

you can also make transparent which is

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.339 
you can also make transparent which is
cool<00:04:09.780> so<00:04:10.579> not<00:04:11.579> all<00:04:11.849> moms<00:04:12.120> support<00:04:12.449> transparent

clearly<00:04:14.010> the<00:04:14.129> creeper<00:04:14.430> does<00:04:14.579> not<00:04:14.760> cause<00:04:15.000> it's

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
clearly the creeper does not cause it's

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.509 
clearly the creeper does not cause it's
not<00:04:15.209> making<00:04:15.479> anything<00:04:15.659> transparent<00:04:16.409> but<00:04:17.220> like

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.129 
the wolf I think is pretty sure supports
transparent<00:04:20.239> so<00:04:21.239> you<00:04:21.269> can<00:04:21.630> do<00:04:21.719> this
