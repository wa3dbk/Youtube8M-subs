00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:30.140
 2 and a half years I worked in circuses 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:32.180
 taking care of the elephants ho 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.829
 traveled in all the united states and 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.670
 I went with the elephants also in 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:37.159

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.550
 works in the circus industry not 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.710

 let them suffer in silence 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.510
 I went into the circuses because I wanted to 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:06.100
 stay with the animals and take care of them 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:08.950
 of them but as time passed 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:12.430
 I realized that what I saw 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:15.460
 it was simply the mistreatment of 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.610
 these magnificent creatures the name of the 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.610

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.880

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.240

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:19.160

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.840

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:05.510

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:09.050
 power of animals to train 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.630

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.250
 electric shocks to force them to 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.440
 do the exercises 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.780
 I decided that too much is too much 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.290
 left the circus to tell my story 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.180
 history 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.370

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.860
 in the process against the ringling circus 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.840
 brothers in marbles but levels for the 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:30.380
 violation of United States law 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.870

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:46.270
 Lustrini visits the circuses with the help of 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.880
 human artists without hands 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.380
 if you work at the circus don't look 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.290

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.810
