gloves and make sure the water is really
really<00:00:41.100> hot<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.610> allow<00:00:41.940> everything<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.360> air

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
really hot and allow everything to air

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.150

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
everything's just clean okay so we do

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.490 
everything's just clean okay so we do
peel<00:00:47.940> at<00:00:48.300> this<00:00:48.480> stage<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.110> reason<00:00:49.440> that

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
peel at this stage and the reason that

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.529 
peel at this stage and the reason that
we<00:00:49.620> peel<00:00:49.920> is<00:00:50.190> that<00:00:50.879> that's<00:00:51.059> where<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.300> lot<00:00:51.480> of

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
we peel is that that's where a lot of

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.569 
we peel is that that's where a lot of
the<00:00:51.690> roughage<00:00:52.110> is<00:00:52.289> although<00:00:53.100> although

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
the roughage is although although

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.779 
the roughage is although although
roughage<00:00:54.059> is<00:00:54.210> good<00:00:54.510> when<00:00:54.809> you're<00:00:54.930> older

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
roughage is good when you're older

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:58.970 
roughage is good when you're older
babies<00:00:56.789> find<00:00:57.149> roughage<00:00:57.660> too<00:00:58.079> much<00:00:58.500> for<00:00:58.859> their

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
babies find roughage too much for their

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.010 
babies find roughage too much for their
little<00:00:59.129> intestines<00:00:59.850> it's<00:01:00.329> quite<00:01:00.570> coarse

little intestines it's quite coarse
roughage<00:01:01.469> as<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.739> name<00:01:01.920> suggests<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.820> it

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
roughage as the name suggests and it

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.840 
roughage as the name suggests and it
will<00:01:03.210> basically<00:01:03.629> cause<00:01:04.500> some<00:01:05.040> irritation<00:01:05.610> on

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
will basically cause some irritation on

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.840 
will basically cause some irritation on
the<00:01:05.909> intestines<00:01:06.510> so<00:01:07.320> always<00:01:08.100> peel<00:01:08.490> at<00:01:08.670> this

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.700 
around about the age of ten months or a
year<00:01:12.360> then<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:13.020> need<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.290> worry<00:01:13.470> less<00:01:13.650> about

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
year then you need to worry less about

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.520 
year then you need to worry less about
peel<00:01:14.570> once<00:01:15.570> it's<00:01:15.720> peeled<00:01:15.869> cut<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.140> pear<00:01:16.350> into

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
peel once it's peeled cut the pear into

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.679 
peel once it's peeled cut the pear into
quarters<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:17.880> can<00:01:18.030> cut<00:01:18.210> out<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.479> hard

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
quarters so you can cut out the hard

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.630 
quarters so you can cut out the hard
core<00:01:19.020> Center<00:01:19.560> it's<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.310> same<00:01:20.490> principle

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
core Center it's the same principle

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.010 
core Center it's the same principle
whether<00:01:21.000> you're<00:01:21.119> doing<00:01:21.240> apples<00:01:21.689> or<00:01:21.810> pears

whether you're doing apples or pears

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.289 
whether you're doing apples or pears
some<00:01:22.740> babies<00:01:23.040> take<00:01:23.220> apples<00:01:23.640> harder<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.060> take

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
some babies take apples harder to take

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.410 
some babies take apples harder to take
them<00:01:24.479> pears<00:01:24.780> as<00:01:25.049> their<00:01:25.830> first<00:01:26.040> food<00:01:26.430> so<00:01:27.360> you

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
them pears as their first food so you

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.359 
them pears as their first food so you
just<00:01:27.540> cut<00:01:27.840> out<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.020> middle<00:01:28.320> core<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.860> then

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
just cut out the middle core and then

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.060 
just cut out the middle core and then
once<00:01:29.520> you've<00:01:29.759> taken<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.360> hard<00:01:30.570> core<00:01:30.810> out<00:01:31.070> cut

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
once you've taken the hard core out cut

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.700 
once you've taken the hard core out cut
them<00:01:32.189> into<00:01:32.490> really<00:01:32.850> small<00:01:33.000> bits<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:34.350> you'll

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
them into really small bits and you'll

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.499 
them into really small bits and you'll
see<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:35.040> whether<00:01:35.189> I'm<00:01:35.400> making<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:36.090> fruit

up to a vicious boil to start with just
a<00:02:51.860> gentle<00:02:52.190> heat<00:02:52.310> so<00:02:52.550> that<00:02:52.580> the<00:02:52.700> fruit<00:02:53.030> starts

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270

to<00:02:53.480> cook<00:02:53.660> down<00:02:53.840> you<00:02:53.989> get<00:02:54.110> a<00:02:54.140> bit<00:02:54.260> more<00:02:54.350> juice

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
to cook down you get a bit more juice

to cook down you get a bit more juice
out<00:02:54.830> of<00:02:54.860> it<00:02:55.100> and<00:02:55.610> then<00:02:55.760> you<00:02:55.820> want<00:02:55.970> to<00:02:56.030> bring<00:02:56.180> it

just take a little bit that looks as

just take a little bit that looks as
though<00:03:21.320> it's<00:03:21.560> still<00:03:21.650> quite<00:03:21.980> hardened<00:03:22.400> and<00:03:22.580> one

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
though it's still quite hardened and one

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.460 
you'll see that it soon squishes down to
a<00:03:29.570> nice<00:03:29.750> smooth<00:03:30.140> softness<00:03:31.989> so<00:03:32.989> we're<00:03:33.110> ready

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
a nice smooth softness so we're ready

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.500 
a nice smooth softness so we're ready
so<00:03:34.280> the<00:03:34.370> pears<00:03:34.580> are<00:03:34.730> cooked<00:03:34.940> but<00:03:35.150> we<00:03:35.239> now<00:03:35.360> need

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
so the pears are cooked but we now need

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.479 
so the pears are cooked but we now need
to<00:03:35.570> turn<00:03:35.720> it<00:03:35.810> into<00:03:35.900> a<00:03:35.989> smooth<00:03:36.260> puree<00:03:36.560> now<00:03:37.430> the

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
to turn it into a smooth puree now the

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:39.310 
to turn it into a smooth puree now the
old-fashioned<00:03:38.420> way<00:03:38.570> of<00:03:38.690> doing<00:03:38.900> this<00:03:38.989> is<00:03:39.170> to

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
old-fashioned way of doing this is to

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.170 
old-fashioned way of doing this is to
squeeze<00:03:39.680> it<00:03:39.890> through<00:03:39.920> a<00:03:40.160> sieve<00:03:40.519> a<00:03:40.549> very<00:03:40.850> fine

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
squeeze it through a sieve a very fine

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.120 
squeeze it through a sieve a very fine
metal<00:03:41.540> sieve<00:03:41.720> or<00:03:41.840> the<00:03:41.900> back<00:03:42.080> of<00:03:42.110> a<00:03:42.290> spoon<00:03:42.410> which

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
metal sieve or the back of a spoon which

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.710 
metal sieve or the back of a spoon which
are<00:03:43.280> welcome<00:03:43.580> to<00:03:43.700> do<00:03:43.850> but<00:03:44.120> actually<00:03:44.209> I<00:03:44.600> think

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
are welcome to do but actually I think

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.289 
are welcome to do but actually I think
times<00:03:45.110> a<00:03:45.170> little<00:03:45.230> bit<00:03:45.470> too<00:03:45.590> precious<00:03:45.920> so<00:03:46.670> one

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:47.299 
times a little bit too precious so one

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:48.820 
times a little bit too precious so one
of<00:03:47.330> the<00:03:47.510> things<00:03:48.170> that<00:03:48.290> a<00:03:48.320> lot<00:03:48.410> of<00:03:48.470> people<00:03:48.680> reach

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
of the things that a lot of people reach

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.160 
of the things that a lot of people reach
for<00:03:49.100> is<00:03:49.190> a<00:03:49.220> hand<00:03:49.489> blender<00:03:49.760> and<00:03:50.510> these<00:03:50.690> the<00:03:50.959> hand

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
for is a hand blender and these the hand

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:52.840 
for is a hand blender and these the hand
blender<00:03:51.470> with<00:03:51.620> this<00:03:51.830> kind<00:03:52.130> of<00:03:52.190> attachment

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
blender with this kind of attachment

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.720 
blender with this kind of attachment
gives<00:03:53.540> you<00:03:53.660> an<00:03:53.720> okay<00:03:54.380> puree<00:03:54.920> but<00:03:55.190> at<00:03:55.430> this

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
gives you an okay puree but at this

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.759 
gives you an okay puree but at this
stage<00:03:55.790> because<00:03:56.450> your<00:03:56.570> babies<00:03:56.840> only<00:03:57.049> ever<00:03:57.440> had

milk any textures a little bit of a
surprise<00:04:00.769> to<00:04:00.980> them<00:04:01.280> so<00:04:01.400> you<00:04:01.459> want<00:04:01.549> to<00:04:01.670> get<00:04:01.760> it

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820 
surprise to them so you want to get it

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.180

as<00:04:01.940> smooth<00:04:02.239> as<00:04:02.360> possible<00:04:02.450> so<00:04:03.350> instead<00:04:03.739> get<00:04:04.010> rid

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
as smooth as possible so instead get rid

as smooth as possible so instead get rid
of<00:04:04.220> this<00:04:04.430> bit<00:04:04.700> and<00:04:04.970> invest<00:04:05.450> in<00:04:05.600> a<00:04:05.660> hand<00:04:05.900> blender

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
of this bit and invest in a hand blender

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.550 
of this bit and invest in a hand blender
that<00:04:06.920> has<00:04:07.220> a<00:04:07.579> herb<00:04:08.030> chopping<00:04:08.450> attachment<00:04:09.110> like

that has a herb chopping attachment like
this<00:04:09.769> at<00:04:09.950> the<00:04:10.010> bottom<00:04:10.310> of<00:04:10.430> it

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:13.569 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:15.899 

pour<00:04:14.260> the<00:04:14.379> puree<00:04:14.590> into<00:04:15.069> the<00:04:15.189> chopping

00:04:15.899 --> 00:04:15.909 
pour the puree into the chopping

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:17.789 
pour the puree into the chopping
attachment<00:04:16.449> you<00:04:16.840> won't<00:04:17.019> need<00:04:17.199> necessarily

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
attachment you won't need necessarily

attachment you won't need necessarily
all<00:04:17.919> of<00:04:18.070> the<00:04:18.160> juice<00:04:18.400> and<00:04:18.729> so<00:04:19.299> just<00:04:19.539> make<00:04:19.720> sure

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
all of the juice and so just make sure

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.990 
all of the juice and so just make sure
you<00:04:20.410> get<00:04:20.590> the<00:04:20.769> solids<00:04:21.160> rather<00:04:21.430> than<00:04:21.699> the<00:04:21.789> juice

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
you get the solids rather than the juice

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.040 
you get the solids rather than the juice
at<00:04:22.120> this<00:04:22.240> point<00:04:22.509> you<00:04:22.570> can<00:04:22.690> always<00:04:22.810> add<00:04:23.020> a

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
at this point you can always add a

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:28.860 
at this point you can always add a
little<00:04:23.229> bit<00:04:23.320> more<00:04:23.470> juice<00:04:23.620> at<00:04:23.860> the<00:04:23.949> end<00:04:27.750> pop<00:04:28.750> the

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
little bit more juice at the end pop the

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.710 
little bit more juice at the end pop the
lid<00:04:28.990> on<00:04:29.110> and<00:04:29.350> give<00:04:29.770> it<00:04:29.800> a<00:04:29.949> blitz<00:04:30.660> now<00:04:31.660> I've

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
lid on and give it a blitz now I've

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.300 
lid on and give it a blitz now I've
chosen<00:04:31.930> to<00:04:32.229> use<00:04:32.259> pears<00:04:32.740> because<00:04:33.009> they

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
chosen to use pears because they

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.340 
chosen to use pears because they
actually<00:04:33.490> blitz<00:04:34.270> down<00:04:34.539> really<00:04:34.840> quickly<00:04:35.169> and

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
actually blitz down really quickly and

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.200 
actually blitz down really quickly and
really<00:04:35.560> smoothly<00:04:35.889> when<00:04:36.550> you<00:04:36.669> do<00:04:36.789> something

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
really smoothly when you do something

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.520 
really smoothly when you do something
more<00:04:37.300> interesting<00:04:37.509> and<00:04:38.020> harder<00:04:38.410> vegetables

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
more interesting and harder vegetables

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.010 
more interesting and harder vegetables
they<00:04:39.400> will<00:04:39.610> actually<00:04:39.789> take<00:04:40.720> a<00:04:40.750> little<00:04:40.930> bit

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
they will actually take a little bit

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.680 
they will actually take a little bit
long<00:04:41.229> to<00:04:41.380> blitz<00:04:41.560> down<00:04:45.240> so<00:04:46.240> all<00:04:46.300> I'm<00:04:46.449> looking

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
long to blitz down so all I'm looking

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:47.790 
long to blitz down so all I'm looking
for<00:04:46.840> to<00:04:46.930> see<00:04:47.050> if<00:04:47.110> there's<00:04:47.259> any<00:04:47.380> little<00:04:47.650> bits

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
for to see if there's any little bits

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:53.670 
for to see if there's any little bits
left<00:04:47.979> which<00:04:48.250> I<00:04:48.370> can<00:04:48.460> tell<00:04:48.610> us<00:04:48.699> is<00:04:48.820> fine<00:04:52.590> it's<00:04:53.590> a

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
left which I can tell us is fine it's a

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.070 
left which I can tell us is fine it's a
very<00:04:53.889> smooth<00:04:54.400> simple<00:04:55.210> puree<00:04:55.509> that<00:04:55.870> we've<00:04:55.960> got

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
very smooth simple puree that we've got

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.719 
very smooth simple puree that we've got
left<00:04:58.500> now<00:04:59.500> you<00:04:59.560> can<00:04:59.710> either<00:04:59.860> choose<00:05:00.250> to<00:05:00.520> serve

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:00.729 
left now you can either choose to serve

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:02.159 
left now you can either choose to serve
this<00:05:00.910> a<00:05:01.120> little<00:05:01.389> bit<00:05:01.479> to<00:05:01.570> your<00:05:01.660> baby<00:05:01.870> now

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:02.169 
this a little bit to your baby now

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:05.180 
this a little bit to your baby now
obviously<00:05:02.860> and<00:05:02.949> allow<00:05:03.130> it<00:05:03.280> to<00:05:03.310> cool<00:05:03.639> but<00:05:04.539> a

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
obviously and allow it to cool but a

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.320 
obviously and allow it to cool but a
little<00:05:06.190> bit<00:05:06.310> of<00:05:06.400> preparation<00:05:06.970> means<00:05:07.150> that

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
little bit of preparation means that

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:08.790 
little bit of preparation means that
you've<00:05:07.419> got<00:05:07.570> something<00:05:07.930> for<00:05:08.050> a<00:05:08.110> few<00:05:08.320> days<00:05:08.500> time

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 
you've got something for a few days time

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.219 
you've got something for a few days time
so<00:05:09.729> the<00:05:09.820> best<00:05:09.940> thing<00:05:10.150> to<00:05:10.180> do<00:05:10.360> I<00:05:10.660> think<00:05:10.720> is<00:05:11.080> to

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:11.229 
so the best thing to do I think is to

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:16.110 
so the best thing to do I think is to
freeze<00:05:11.500> some<00:05:14.340> okay<00:05:15.340> so<00:05:15.400> what<00:05:15.639> we're<00:05:15.759> doing<00:05:16.000> is

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
freeze some okay so what we're doing is

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.610 
freeze some okay so what we're doing is
just<00:05:16.150> pouring<00:05:16.690> a<00:05:16.810> little<00:05:16.990> bit<00:05:17.110> into<00:05:17.380> each<00:05:17.500> of

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
just pouring a little bit into each of

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.320 
just pouring a little bit into each of
these<00:05:17.710> cubes<00:05:18.039> they<00:05:18.159> have<00:05:18.280> handed<00:05:18.610> lines<00:05:18.970> which

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
these cubes they have handed lines which
