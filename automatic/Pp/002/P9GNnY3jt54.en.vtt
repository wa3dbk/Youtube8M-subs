00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879 
tripod mount Kenna hangs out in the

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:19.460 
tripod mount Kenna hangs out in the
middle<00:02:16.150> here<00:02:16.440> give<00:02:17.440> you<00:02:17.530> a<00:02:17.590> better<00:02:17.739> view<00:02:17.860> girth

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
middle here give you a better view girth

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.720 
middle here give you a better view girth
where<00:02:20.470> it<00:02:20.590> is<00:02:20.709> right<00:02:20.950> about<00:02:21.129> Sinai<00:02:21.459> with<00:02:21.640> the
