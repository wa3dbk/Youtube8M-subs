00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
holes into the copper to allow air vents

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.249 
holes into the copper to allow air vents
on<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.170> underneath<00:01:22.799> my<00:01:23.900> choking<00:01:24.900> see<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.170> in

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
vents for my laptop and this is a stand

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.649 
vents for my laptop and this is a stand
that<00:01:33.930> I<00:01:34.049> made<00:01:34.350> custom<00:01:34.680> made<00:01:35.040> I<00:01:35.070> put<00:01:35.460> rubber<00:01:35.759> on

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
that I made custom made I put rubber on

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.530 
that I made custom made I put rubber on
there<00:01:37.220> just<00:01:38.220> take<00:01:38.430> on<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.790> keep<00:01:39.299> everything

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
there just take on to keep everything

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.899 
there just take on to keep everything
from<00:01:39.810> sliding<00:01:40.200> around<00:01:40.400> it<00:01:41.400> actually<00:01:41.729> works

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
from sliding around it actually works

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.359 
from sliding around it actually works
really<00:01:42.000> well<00:01:42.210> on<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.509> laptop<00:01:42.899> um<00:01:43.369> no

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
really well on the laptop um no

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.810 
really well on the laptop um no
complaints<00:01:48.470> yeah<00:01:49.470> it's<00:01:49.710> relatively<00:01:50.700> simple

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
complaints yeah it's relatively simple

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.999 
complaints yeah it's relatively simple
it's<00:01:51.329> basically<00:01:52.049> just<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:53.130> stand<00:01:53.399> I<00:01:53.520> made

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
it's basically just a stand I made

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.510 
it's basically just a stand I made
nothing<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.520> it<00:01:56.729> but<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.299> do<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:58.340> some<00:01:59.340> of<00:01:59.430> these

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
nothing to it but to do it some of these

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.249 
nothing to it but to do it some of these
holes<00:01:59.759> were<00:02:00.060> actually<00:02:00.719> pretty<00:02:00.780> hard<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.110> make

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
holes were actually pretty hard to make

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.109 
holes were actually pretty hard to make
I<00:02:01.290> probably<00:02:01.860> should<00:02:02.159> have<00:02:02.219> done<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.640> before<00:02:03.090> I

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
I probably should have done it before I

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.780 
I probably should have done it before I
actually<00:02:03.920> soldered<00:02:04.920> them<00:02:05.219> onto<00:02:05.490> this<00:02:05.579> piece

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
actually soldered them onto this piece

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.999 
actually soldered them onto this piece
of<00:02:05.909> copper<00:02:06.240> this<00:02:06.899> coppers<00:02:07.320> just<00:02:07.560> held<00:02:07.740> in<00:02:07.860> by

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
of copper this coppers just held in by

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.090 
of copper this coppers just held in by
friction<00:02:08.429> and

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
friction and

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.240 
friction and
just<00:02:09.970> snaps<00:02:10.870> in<00:02:11.110> basically<00:02:11.590> I<00:02:11.800> can<00:02:11.980> take<00:02:12.220> it

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
just snaps in basically I can take it

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.020 
just snaps in basically I can take it
off<00:02:12.430> pretty<00:02:12.580> easily<00:02:14.370> yeah<00:02:15.370> so<00:02:15.640> there's<00:02:15.820> that<00:02:15.880> I

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
off pretty easily yeah so there's that I

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.000 
off pretty easily yeah so there's that I
just<00:02:16.420> leave<00:02:16.570> it<00:02:16.690> running<00:02:16.810> it<00:02:17.470> actually<00:02:17.710> keeps

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
just leave it running it actually keeps

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.970 
just leave it running it actually keeps
it<00:02:18.220> cooler<00:02:18.430> by<00:02:18.880> about<00:02:19.630> five<00:02:19.960> degrees<00:02:20.140> or<00:02:20.470> so<00:02:20.650> on

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
it cooler by about five degrees or so on

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.030 
it cooler by about five degrees or so on
a<00:02:21.190> stress<00:02:21.490> test<00:02:22.500> which<00:02:23.500> is<00:02:23.530> what<00:02:23.860> i<00:02:23.890> was

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
it looks better at night than it does

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.600 
it looks better at night than it does
during<00:02:52.360> the<00:02:52.420> day<00:02:53.160> since<00:02:54.160> it's<00:02:54.310> running<00:02:54.550> on

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
during the day since it's running on

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.190 
during the day since it's running on
batteries<00:02:55.060> I<00:02:55.210> don't<00:02:55.390> usually<00:02:55.570> have<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:55.930> fan

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
batteries I don't usually have the fan

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.480 
batteries I don't usually have the fan
running<00:02:56.470> cuz<00:02:58.080> these<00:02:59.080> dude<00:02:59.410> sure<00:02:59.680> do<00:03:00.040> its<00:03:00.220> job

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490

running cuz these dude sure do its job
so<00:03:01.350> sufficiently<00:03:03.060> doesn't<00:03:04.060> really<00:03:04.360> need<00:03:04.540> to

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
so sufficiently doesn't really need to

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.950 
so sufficiently doesn't really need to
have<00:03:05.800> been<00:03:05.950> running<00:03:06.220> all<00:03:06.310> the<00:03:06.430> time<00:03:06.960> I'm

of<00:03:09.700> copper<00:03:10.060> on<00:03:10.320> here<00:03:11.320> just<00:03:11.650> going<00:03:12.010> down<00:03:12.280> that

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270 
of copper on here just going down that

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.290 
of copper on here just going down that
way<00:03:13.390> it's<00:03:13.540> like<00:03:13.660> a<00:03:14.460> like<00:03:15.460> a<00:03:15.610> more<00:03:16.150> of<00:03:16.240> a

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
way it's like a like a more of a

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.220 
way it's like a like a more of a
radiator<00:03:16.720> than<00:03:16.960> just<00:03:17.140> a<00:03:17.230> few<00:03:17.410> pins<00:03:17.620> to<00:03:17.890> you

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
radiator than just a few pins to you

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.200 
radiator than just a few pins to you
should<00:03:20.230> have<00:03:20.380> done<00:03:20.740> that<00:03:20.770> before<00:03:21.100> I<00:03:21.370> did<00:03:22.060> it
