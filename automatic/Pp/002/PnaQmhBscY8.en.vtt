all<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.210> way<00:00:42.300> down<00:00:42.510> there<00:00:43.460> okay<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:44.780> suggest

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
all the way down there okay I suggest

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.290 
all the way down there okay I suggest
that<00:00:46.079> you<00:00:46.379> make<00:00:47.010> it<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:47.969> little<00:00:48.149> more<00:00:48.329> buoyant

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
that you make it a little more buoyant

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:58.099 
that you make it a little more buoyant
by<00:00:51.300> going<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:51.809> getting<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:54.710> couple<00:00:55.710> buoys<00:00:57.109> tuck

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
by going and getting a couple buoys tuck

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.970 
by going and getting a couple buoys tuck
some<00:00:58.289> buoys<00:00:58.440> in<00:00:58.770> here<00:00:59.420> you<00:01:00.420> see<00:01:00.629> I've<00:01:01.559> got<00:01:01.620> some

some buoys in here you see I've got some
rope<00:01:02.160> on<00:01:02.370> them<00:01:02.489> I<00:01:02.670> got<00:01:03.270> some<00:01:03.480> booties<00:01:03.840> there's

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
rope on them I got some booties there's

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.260 
rope on them I got some booties there's
two<00:01:04.350> buoys<00:01:04.589> blue<00:01:05.010> on<00:01:05.220> each<00:01:05.369> side<00:01:05.700> this<00:01:06.000> side

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
two buoys blue on each side this side

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.770 
two buoys blue on each side this side
and<00:01:06.740> this<00:01:07.740> side<00:01:08.000> okay<00:01:09.000> they<00:01:09.060> tuck<00:01:09.390> in<00:01:09.570> there

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
and this side okay they tuck in there

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.200 
and this side okay they tuck in there
and<00:01:10.970> they're<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.360> little<00:01:12.840> more<00:01:13.020> buoyant<00:01:14.210> so

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
and they're a little more buoyant so

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.730 
and they're a little more buoyant so
basically<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:16.110> drilled<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.650> hole<00:01:16.680> through<00:01:18.740> the

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
basically I drilled a hole through the

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.330 
basically I drilled a hole through the
top<00:01:19.770> up<00:01:20.159> here<00:01:21.950> added<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.040> couple<00:01:23.280> couple<00:01:24.119> ropes

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
top up here added a couple couple ropes

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.700 
top up here added a couple couple ropes
to<00:01:26.340> hold<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.670> buoys<00:01:26.970> in<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:27.330> took<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.869> buoys<00:01:28.200> on

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
to hold the buoys in I took the buoys on

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.910 
to hold the buoys in I took the buoys on
the<00:01:29.369> inside<00:01:29.790> in<00:01:30.000> here<00:01:30.210> okay<00:01:31.170> so<00:01:32.570> basically

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
the inside in here okay so basically

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.569 
the inside in here okay so basically
when<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.009> thing<00:01:35.040> flips<00:01:35.610> over<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.650> it<00:01:37.650> stays

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
when the thing flips over and it stays

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.440 
when the thing flips over and it stays
up<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:39.210> little<00:01:39.450> bit<00:01:39.570> better<00:01:39.920> but<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:41.250> lost<00:01:42.150> all<00:01:42.390> my

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
up a little bit better but I lost all my

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.050 
up a little bit better but I lost all my
salmon<00:01:43.110> gear<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:44.280> I<00:01:44.399> flipped<00:01:44.670> over<00:01:44.790> in<00:01:45.030> the

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
salmon gear and I flipped over in the

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.539 
salmon gear and I flipped over in the
Puget<00:01:45.450> Sound<00:01:45.649> very<00:01:46.649> cold<00:01:46.890> water<00:01:47.130> very

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
Puget Sound very cold water very

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.910 
Puget Sound very cold water very
dangerous<00:01:48.000> effect<00:01:48.390> but<00:01:49.350> when<00:01:49.619> you're<00:01:49.740> trying

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920
