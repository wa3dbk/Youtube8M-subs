 Translated by SoreZar 

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 Designer of the Gangplank, one of the top 40 champions 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.360
 Fantasyworld is also the designer of Dr.Mundo 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.240
 however, he left Riot Games. 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.820
 Currently there are serious studies on Gangplank 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.140
 Sion level is expected a rework 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.020
 There will be 3 items specific to Gangplank in the shop 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.540
 and these items are supposed to address the ability of Gangplank 3 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.180
 however, the names of the items or what they do are not yet disclosed ... 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.140
 I will let you know when you update this issue. 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.460
 Although there is still not much information 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.180
 The important role of Gangplank in the butcher bridge event 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.880
 and special dialogues. If you do not know the map, click on the card! 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.500
 After the Freljord and Shurima events, it is now in Bilgewater! 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.960
 so great innovations should be close! 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:56.000
 This is not the first innovation in the Gangplank! 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.260
 but the first comes true in a real sense of gameplay! 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:06.760
 In the first season of League of Legends, Gangplank had to kill one of his minions to use his E-skill. 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.360
 and the only champion who could kill his friendly minions 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.820
 it was a huge disadvantage to kill our own petite 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.900
 however, Riot was able to prevent the opponent from gaining gold to remove his skill as he pounded his own pet. 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.200
 At that time we realized that at that time there was not much of the logic of the last hit ... 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.100
 Gangplank uses his weapon instead of the sword when he performs critical strokes. 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.780
 Gangplank, which can survive heavy mass control like Malzahar's ulti 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.440
 Riot has produced orange balls. 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.580
 There are pictures of the Gangplank on these balls and "No problem!" author 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.520
 it appeared in 2011 for Gangplank 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.020
 "I don't know who threw me ulti but I ate oranges so no problem!" popularized after the joke 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:53.980
 Gangplank, the source of jokes, is related to the treatment of sclerotic scabies with a vitamin C disease. 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.920
 Seafarers who are away from fresh fruit in case of long-term travel can get this disease. 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:06.180
 Likewise, pirates "Rum" drinking is also a tradition taken as a measure related to scoliosis and therefore vitamin C! 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.900
 The Special Operations Gangplank costume was issued to celebrate the beginning of the Brazilian server! 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:16.280
 In the costume, the Gangplank was planned to eat bananas and pineapples instead of oranges, but it was not. 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.980
 You can see Miss Fortune in the background of the costume 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.220
 the other 2 characters are not certain who they are, but many agree that someone is Talon! 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.280
 Who do you think they can be ??? 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.880
 Barbaros Gangplank costume was issued to celebrate the 1st year of Turkey servers 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.800
 and foreign servers as the Sultan Gangplank passes! 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:42.820
 This costume is of course Red Beard reference Barbaros Hayrettin Paşa and Turkey has a special voiceover by Zafer Algöz server! 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.940
 Bilgewater activities are fast approaching 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.420
 so we will concentrate on Bilgewater for a while 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:54.720
