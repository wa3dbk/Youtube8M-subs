00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.000
 You cheated me, Garrosh. 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.000
 You are not worthy of your father's legacy. 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.500
 It is not for you alone to dictate judgment against him. 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.500
 I will not allow you to take it. 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.900
 We have all suffered with their atrocities. 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.700
 My people more than the rest. 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.850
 Allow your trial to be in Pandaria. 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.900
 And we will apply our justice for all its crimes. 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.230
 The Horde needs a true Warchief, now more than ever. 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:14.730
 But you have been the one who has kept the Horde united in this madness. 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.730
 It's you who has protected our honor. 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.600
 From now and forever, Vol'Jin 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.730
 If you are our leader, I will follow you 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.330
 I .... I'm not worthy ... 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:49.930
 But I will give it all, for the HORDE! 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.930
 I want to talk to your War Chief! 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.330
 I speak for the Horde. 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.230
 Very well. The horde has committed too many crimes, Vol'Jin. 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.030
 But some of you have fought against the tyranny of Garrosh. 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.900
 That's why I hope this bloodshed ends. 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.930
 But keep this in mind: 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:36.330
 If the horde is not able to maintain its honor, as it did with Garrosh, 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.900
 WE will finish with YOU.
