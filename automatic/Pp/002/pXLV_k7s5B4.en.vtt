my<00:00:21.779> impossible<00:00:22.410> bottles<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.100> if<00:00:23.160> you<00:00:23.220> saw<00:00:23.369> my

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
my impossible bottles and if you saw my

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.609 
my impossible bottles and if you saw my
last<00:00:23.640> video<00:00:23.850> I<00:00:24.150> was<00:00:24.390> showing<00:00:24.840> this<00:00:24.960> impossible

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
last video I was showing this impossible

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.640 
last video I was showing this impossible
bottle<00:00:26.099> puzzle<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:27.080> someone<00:00:28.080> commented<00:00:28.349> that

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
bottle puzzle and someone commented that

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.859 
bottle puzzle and someone commented that
I<00:00:28.800> should<00:00:29.099> put<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.460> pin<00:00:29.670> inside<00:00:30.599> of<00:00:30.779> the

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
I should put the pin inside of the

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.110 
I should put the pin inside of the
bottom<00:00:31.199> hole<00:00:31.380> here<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:31.859> I<00:00:32.309> sure<00:00:32.790> enough<00:00:32.969> was

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
bottom hole here and I sure enough was

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.240 
bottom hole here and I sure enough was
able<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.390> do<00:00:33.600> that<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:34.559> I<00:00:34.860> guess<00:00:35.010> that's<00:00:35.130> the

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
able to do that and I guess that's the

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.860 
able to do that and I guess that's the
way<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:35.550> was<00:00:35.640> supposed<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.059> be<00:00:36.180> done<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.719> when

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
way it was supposed to be done and when

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.180 
way it was supposed to be done and when
I<00:00:36.899> got<00:00:37.140> it<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:37.410> didn't<00:00:37.590> come<00:00:37.739> that<00:00:37.860> way<00:00:37.980> so<00:00:38.040> I

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
I got it it didn't come that way so I

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.470 
I got it it didn't come that way so I
didn't<00:00:38.399> know<00:00:38.489> after<00:00:39.149> getting<00:00:39.360> this

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
didn't know after getting this

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.360 
didn't know after getting this
impossible<00:00:39.899> bottle<00:00:40.320> puzzle<00:00:40.649> it<00:00:40.800> really<00:00:41.040> kind

might<00:00:48.809> remember<00:00:48.930> this<00:00:49.350> one<00:00:49.649> this<00:00:49.860> one<00:00:50.129> is<00:00:50.160> my

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
might remember this one this one is my

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.209 
might remember this one this one is my
brain<00:00:51.090> cube<00:00:51.449> inside<00:00:51.809> of<00:00:52.020> this<00:00:52.230> crazy<00:00:52.590> head<00:00:52.920> jar

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
brain cube inside of this crazy head jar

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.580 
brain cube inside of this crazy head jar
the<00:00:53.670> cube<00:00:54.000> won't<00:00:54.210> actually<00:00:54.420> fit<00:00:54.660> through<00:00:55.469> the

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
the cube won't actually fit through the

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.869 
the cube won't actually fit through the
neck<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:55.980> jar<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.430> so<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:56.670> sure<00:00:56.850> enough

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
neck of the jar and so it sure enough

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.840 
neck of the jar and so it sure enough
it's<00:00:57.300> an<00:00:57.570> impossible<00:00:58.230> jar<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.770> anyway<00:00:59.730> this

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
it's an impossible jar and anyway this

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.279 
it's an impossible jar and anyway this
one<00:01:00.030> has<00:01:00.180> been<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.359> lot<00:01:00.539> of<00:01:00.570> fun<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:00.989> I've<00:01:01.079> liked

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
one has been a lot of fun and I've liked

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.319 
one has been a lot of fun and I've liked
it<00:01:01.500> for<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:01.770> while<00:01:01.920> but<00:01:02.430> anyway<00:01:02.879> after<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.149> got

it for a while but anyway after I got
this<00:01:03.510> one<00:01:03.690> I<00:01:03.719> really<00:01:03.989> want<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.199> just<00:01:04.409> put<00:01:04.559> a

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
this one I really want to just put a

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.910 
this one I really want to just put a
Rubik's<00:01:05.129> Cube<00:01:05.189> in<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:06.330> bottle<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:06.990> I've<00:01:07.590> wanted

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
Rubik's Cube in a bottle and I've wanted

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.679 
Rubik's Cube in a bottle and I've wanted
to<00:01:07.979> do<00:01:08.130> that<00:01:08.159> for<00:01:08.640> such<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:08.880> long<00:01:09.150> time<00:01:09.360> in<00:01:09.540> fact

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
to do that for such a long time in fact

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.719 
to do that for such a long time in fact
about<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:10.020> couple<00:01:10.350> years<00:01:10.560> ago<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:10.979> bought<00:01:11.490> this

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
about a couple years ago I bought this

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.719 
about a couple years ago I bought this
jar<00:01:12.119> here<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.630> as<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.290> can<00:01:13.380> see<00:01:13.439> it's<00:01:14.369> empty

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
jar here and as you can see it's empty

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.730 
jar here and as you can see it's empty
and<00:01:14.939> that's<00:01:15.090> because<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:15.900> wasn't<00:01:16.259> able<00:01:16.530> to

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
and that's because I wasn't able to

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.230 
and that's because I wasn't able to
actually<00:01:17.009> put<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.520> Rubik's<00:01:17.820> Cube<00:01:17.850> inside

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
actually put a Rubik's Cube inside

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.640 
actually put a Rubik's Cube inside
because<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.540> neck<00:01:18.720> is<00:01:18.869> actually<00:01:19.170> too<00:01:19.290> small

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
because the neck is actually too small

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.410 
because the neck is actually too small
so<00:01:20.280> I'm<00:01:20.400> forgetting<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.790> impossible<00:01:21.150> bottle

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
so I'm forgetting the impossible bottle

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.550 
so I'm forgetting the impossible bottle
puzzle<00:01:22.080> I<00:01:22.200> found<00:01:22.710> this<00:01:23.040> jar<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:24.960> was<00:01:25.020> the

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
puzzle I found this jar and it was the

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.410 
puzzle I found this jar and it was the
right<00:01:25.710> size<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:26.159> put<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.340> Rubik's<00:01:26.700> Cube<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.090> in

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
right size to put a Rubik's Cube and in

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.999 
right size to put a Rubik's Cube and in
fact<00:01:27.630> this<00:01:27.780> is<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:27.960> mini<00:01:28.200> Rubik's<00:01:28.619> Cube<00:01:28.860> I

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
fact this is a mini Rubik's Cube I

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.819 
fact this is a mini Rubik's Cube I
forget<00:01:29.579> what<00:01:29.759> type<00:01:30.060> but<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:31.140> fits<00:01:31.439> in<00:01:31.619> here<00:01:31.770> it

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
forget what type but it fits in here it

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.170 
forget what type but it fits in here it
was<00:01:31.920> actually<00:01:32.189> really<00:01:32.369> easy<00:01:32.400> because<00:01:32.850> this

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
was actually really easy because this

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.990 
was actually really easy because this
this<00:01:33.540> opening<00:01:34.229> is<00:01:34.350> so<00:01:34.560> large<00:01:34.860> that<00:01:35.250> I<00:01:35.579> was<00:01:35.880> able

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
this opening is so large that I was able

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.249 
this opening is so large that I was able
to<00:01:36.210> put<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.540> in<00:01:36.659> there<00:01:36.780> without<00:01:36.990> too<00:01:37.140> much

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
to put it in there without too much

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.960 
to put it in there without too much
trouble<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:37.829> had<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.009> assemble<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.640> it

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
trouble and I had to assemble it and it

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.580 
trouble and I had to assemble it and it
probably<00:01:39.240> took<00:01:39.360> maybe<00:01:39.630> twenty-five<00:01:40.170> minutes

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
probably took maybe twenty-five minutes

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.590 
probably took maybe twenty-five minutes
something<00:01:40.799> like<00:01:40.920> that<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:42.060> it<00:01:42.180> ended<00:01:42.210> up

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
something like that and it ended up

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.200 
something like that and it ended up
looking<00:01:42.960> really<00:01:43.409> good<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.920> I'm<00:01:44.579> pretty<00:01:44.939> I'm

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
looking really good and I'm pretty I'm

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.450 
looking really good and I'm pretty I'm
pretty<00:01:45.240> happy<00:01:45.720> with<00:01:45.840> it<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.860> as<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.250> can<00:01:47.340> see

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
pretty happy with it and as you can see

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.249 
pretty happy with it and as you can see
it<00:01:47.549> doesn't<00:01:47.790> it<00:01:48.060> can't<00:01:48.329> come<00:01:48.570> out<00:01:48.600> won't<00:01:49.049> fall

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
it doesn't it can't come out won't fall

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.170 
it doesn't it can't come out won't fall
out<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:50.040> put<00:01:50.220> it<00:01:50.340> in<00:01:50.430> my<00:01:50.520> Cuban<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:50.909> cube

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
out and I put it in my Cuban a cube

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.999 
out and I put it in my Cuban a cube
pattern<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.810> I<00:01:52.200> think<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.439> looks<00:01:52.560> great<00:01:52.710> and

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
pattern and I think it looks great and

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.770 
pattern and I think it looks great and
so<00:01:53.189> after<00:01:53.640> making<00:01:53.759> this<00:01:54.060> one<00:01:54.270> I<00:01:54.299> was<00:01:54.540> kind<00:01:54.750> of

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
so after making this one I was kind of

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.069 
so after making this one I was kind of
hooked<00:01:55.020> so<00:01:55.619> I<00:01:56.040> went<00:01:56.729> ahead<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:56.969> made<00:01:57.149> this<00:01:57.780> one

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
hooked so I went ahead and made this one

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.450 
hooked so I went ahead and made this one
and<00:01:59.240> this<00:02:00.240> one<00:02:00.509> is<00:02:01.140> just<00:02:01.799> you<00:02:02.100> know<00:02:02.130> another

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
and this one is just you know another

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.520 
and this one is just you know another
mini<00:02:03.030> cube<00:02:03.329> inside<00:02:03.719> of<00:02:03.899> this<00:02:04.049> jar<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:04.469> it

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
mini cube inside of this jar and it

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.530 
mini cube inside of this jar and it
won't<00:02:04.680> come<00:02:04.860> out<00:02:05.100> because<00:02:05.340> it<00:02:05.640> doesn't<00:02:05.880> it

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
won't come out because it doesn't it

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.979 
won't come out because it doesn't it
can't<00:02:06.780> fit<00:02:07.140> through<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.220> hole<00:02:08.399> so<00:02:09.030> after

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
can't fit through the hole so after

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.869 
can't fit through the hole so after
making<00:02:10.140> this<00:02:10.440> one<00:02:10.649> I<00:02:10.679> really<00:02:10.920> wanted<00:02:11.280> to<00:02:11.459> put<00:02:11.849> a

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
making this one I really wanted to put a

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:12.320 
making this one I really wanted to put a
second

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
second

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.000 
second
-<00:02:12.420> mini<00:02:12.630> cube<00:02:12.960> up<00:02:13.110> there<00:02:13.290> and<00:02:13.470> I<00:02:13.500> got<00:02:13.830> really

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
- mini cube up there and I got really

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.550 
- mini cube up there and I got really
far<00:02:14.370> but<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.240> very<00:02:15.480> last<00:02:15.570> layer<00:02:16.080> I<00:02:16.110> couldn't

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
far but the very last layer I couldn't

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.980 
far but the very last layer I couldn't
it<00:02:16.740> wouldn't<00:02:17.010> actually<00:02:17.160> physically<00:02:17.910> fit<00:02:18.330> so

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
it wouldn't actually physically fit so

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.470 
it wouldn't actually physically fit so
that<00:02:19.410> was<00:02:19.560> -<00:02:19.770> just<00:02:19.980> that<00:02:20.280> was<00:02:20.400> too<00:02:20.550> bad<00:02:20.730> I<00:02:21.000> tried

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
that was - just that was too bad I tried

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.110 
that was - just that was too bad I tried
putting<00:02:21.660> this<00:02:21.870> puzzle<00:02:22.110> in<00:02:22.380> there<00:02:22.560> as<00:02:22.740> well<00:02:23.120> and

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
putting this puzzle in there as well and

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.210 
putting this puzzle in there as well and
I<00:02:24.690> was<00:02:24.870> unable<00:02:25.080> to<00:02:25.290> put<00:02:25.500> this<00:02:25.680> puzzle<00:02:26.040> in

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
I was unable to put this puzzle in

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.310 
I was unable to put this puzzle in
because<00:02:26.700> it<00:02:26.910> just<00:02:27.270> literally<00:02:27.540> wouldn't<00:02:28.050> fit

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
because it just literally wouldn't fit

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.190 
because it just literally wouldn't fit
so<00:02:29.010> anyway<00:02:29.730> after<00:02:29.910> you<00:02:30.540> know<00:02:30.870> playing<00:02:31.110> with

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
so anyway after you know playing with

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.500 
so anyway after you know playing with
this<00:02:31.410> I<00:02:31.530> really<00:02:31.800> wanted<00:02:32.160> to<00:02:32.370> find<00:02:33.090> a<00:02:33.240> jar<00:02:33.480> that

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
this I really wanted to find a jar that

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.180 
this I really wanted to find a jar that
had<00:02:33.750> a<00:02:33.780> much<00:02:34.020> smaller<00:02:34.410> opening<00:02:34.890> that<00:02:35.010> would<00:02:35.100> be

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
had a much smaller opening that would be

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.430 
had a much smaller opening that would be
a<00:02:35.220> lot<00:02:35.520> more<00:02:35.730> difficult<00:02:35.970> and<00:02:36.420> I<00:02:37.050> was<00:02:37.200> at<00:02:37.320> my

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
a lot more difficult and I was at my

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.490 
a lot more difficult and I was at my
brother's<00:02:37.590> house<00:02:37.920> and<00:02:38.300> he<00:02:39.300> pulled<00:02:39.570> out<00:02:39.720> this

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
brother's house and he pulled out this

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.800 
brother's house and he pulled out this
jar<00:02:40.770> and<00:02:41.010> I<00:02:41.730> went<00:02:41.940> ahead<00:02:42.000> and<00:02:42.270> put<00:02:42.390> a<00:02:42.420> Rubik's

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
jar and I went ahead and put a Rubik's

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.380 
jar and I went ahead and put a Rubik's
Cube<00:02:42.870> inside<00:02:43.290> of<00:02:43.440> this<00:02:43.560> jar<00:02:43.860> and<00:02:44.010> oh<00:02:44.700> man<00:02:45.120> this

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
Cube inside of this jar and oh man this

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.230 
Cube inside of this jar and oh man this
was<00:02:45.690> really<00:02:46.470> hard<00:02:46.740> it<00:02:46.920> took<00:02:47.160> about<00:02:47.400> four<00:02:48.060> hours

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
was really hard it took about four hours

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.230 
was really hard it took about four hours
to<00:02:48.660> get<00:02:49.020> that<00:02:49.170> rubik's<00:02:49.530> cube<00:02:49.740> in<00:02:49.830> there<00:02:49.980> and<00:02:50.310> I

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
to get that rubik's cube in there and I

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.240 
to get that rubik's cube in there and I
struggled<00:02:52.050> and<00:02:52.200> struggled<00:02:52.440> for<00:02:52.830> the<00:02:52.860> longest

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
struggled and struggled for the longest

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.710 
struggled and struggled for the longest
time<00:02:53.370> not<00:02:53.820> and<00:02:54.060> I<00:02:54.120> wasn't<00:02:54.270> sure<00:02:54.510> if<00:02:54.630> I'd

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
time not and I wasn't sure if I'd

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.920 
time not and I wasn't sure if I'd
actually<00:02:55.170> ever<00:02:55.380> get<00:02:56.220> it<00:02:56.370> done<00:02:56.550> and<00:02:56.820> I<00:02:57.630> finally

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
actually ever get it done and I finally

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.690 
actually ever get it done and I finally
did<00:02:58.200> and<00:02:58.260> I'm<00:02:58.560> really<00:02:58.830> happy<00:02:59.100> with<00:02:59.250> it<00:02:59.400> I<00:02:59.520> think

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
did and I'm really happy with it I think

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.820 
did and I'm really happy with it I think
it<00:02:59.790> turned<00:02:59.970> out<00:03:00.060> great<00:03:00.300> and<00:03:00.660> as<00:03:01.230> you<00:03:01.350> can<00:03:01.440> see<00:03:01.500> a

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
it turned out great and as you can see a

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.060 
it turned out great and as you can see a
Rubik's<00:03:02.280> Cube<00:03:02.370> cannot<00:03:03.410> it's<00:03:04.410> just<00:03:04.590> not<00:03:04.800> even

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
Rubik's Cube cannot it's just not even

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.310 
Rubik's Cube cannot it's just not even
close<00:03:05.400> to<00:03:05.640> fit<00:03:05.910> through<00:03:06.570> the<00:03:06.780> hole<00:03:06.930> and<00:03:07.140> yeah<00:03:07.290> I

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
close to fit through the hole and yeah I

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.860 
close to fit through the hole and yeah I
was<00:03:07.500> able<00:03:07.620> to<00:03:07.770> get<00:03:07.920> it<00:03:08.070> inside<00:03:08.400> so<00:03:09.000> I'm<00:03:09.660> really

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
was able to get it inside so I'm really

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.570 
was able to get it inside so I'm really
happy<00:03:10.140> with<00:03:10.320> it<00:03:10.380> I<00:03:10.709> didn't<00:03:11.430> actually

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
happy with it I didn't actually

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.120 
happy with it I didn't actually
videotape<00:03:12.270> myself<00:03:12.690> you<00:03:13.290> know<00:03:13.410> working<00:03:13.680> on<00:03:13.980> it

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
videotape myself you know working on it

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.100 
videotape myself you know working on it
and<00:03:14.250> part<00:03:15.120> of<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:15.240> reason<00:03:15.480> is<00:03:15.600> the<00:03:15.780> people<00:03:16.020> who

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
and part of the reason is the people who

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.340 
and part of the reason is the people who
really<00:03:16.350> enjoy<00:03:16.700> impossible<00:03:17.700> bottles<00:03:18.350> there's

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
really enjoy impossible bottles there's

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.680 
really enjoy impossible bottles there's
a<00:03:19.620> lot<00:03:19.890> of<00:03:20.040> secret<00:03:20.400> kind<00:03:20.850> of<00:03:20.970> techniques<00:03:21.450> that

a lot of secret kind of techniques that

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.780 
a lot of secret kind of techniques that
people<00:03:21.840> use<00:03:22.260> to<00:03:22.470> create<00:03:22.769> them<00:03:22.890> and<00:03:23.070> I<00:03:23.610> didn't

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
people use to create them and I didn't

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.420 
people use to create them and I didn't
want<00:03:23.970> to<00:03:24.090> kind<00:03:24.900> of<00:03:24.959> give<00:03:25.290> up<00:03:25.470> my<00:03:25.680> own<00:03:25.860> secrets

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
want to kind of give up my own secrets

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:27.830 
want to kind of give up my own secrets
and<00:03:26.519> I<00:03:26.550> kind<00:03:26.760> of<00:03:26.790> want<00:03:26.970> to<00:03:27.000> keep<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.360> lure<00:03:27.780> of

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
and I kind of want to keep the lure of

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.470 
and I kind of want to keep the lure of
impossible<00:03:28.440> bottles<00:03:28.739> so<00:03:29.220> all<00:03:30.180> I'm<00:03:30.330> going<00:03:30.420> to

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
impossible bottles so all I'm going to

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.000 
impossible bottles so all I'm going to
tell<00:03:30.630> you<00:03:30.750> is<00:03:30.840> I<00:03:30.930> assembled<00:03:31.350> it<00:03:31.410> inside<00:03:31.800> there

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
tell you is I assembled it inside there

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.550 
tell you is I assembled it inside there
and<00:03:32.250> even<00:03:32.850> a<00:03:33.120> core<00:03:33.510> of<00:03:33.690> a<00:03:33.780> Rubik's<00:03:34.080> Cube<00:03:34.170> can't

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
and even a core of a Rubik's Cube can't

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.820 
and even a core of a Rubik's Cube can't
fit<00:03:34.830> in<00:03:35.070> here<00:03:35.850> so<00:03:36.330> you<00:03:36.900> have<00:03:37.350> to<00:03:37.470> kind<00:03:37.650> of<00:03:37.680> even

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
fit in here so you have to kind of even

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.670 
fit in here so you have to kind of even
take<00:03:38.160> the<00:03:38.519> core<00:03:38.730> apart<00:03:39.060> so<00:03:39.510> anyway<00:03:39.930> I'm<00:03:40.019> really

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
take the core apart so anyway I'm really

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.410 
take the core apart so anyway I'm really
happy<00:03:41.010> with<00:03:41.250> how<00:03:41.310> this<00:03:41.610> one<00:03:41.820> turned<00:03:42.060> out<00:03:42.239> I

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
happy with how this one turned out I

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.780 
happy with how this one turned out I
hope<00:03:42.750> you<00:03:42.930> guys<00:03:43.080> think<00:03:43.860> it's<00:03:43.980> cool<00:03:44.220> someone

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
hope you guys think it's cool someone

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.580 
hope you guys think it's cool someone
mentioned<00:03:44.940> it<00:03:45.330> it<00:03:45.660> kind<00:03:45.930> of<00:03:45.959> looks<00:03:46.170> like<00:03:46.260> a

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
mentioned it it kind of looks like a

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.500 
mentioned it it kind of looks like a
trophy<00:03:47.040> and<00:03:47.370> so<00:03:47.519> this<00:03:47.640> is<00:03:47.760> my<00:03:47.880> trophy<00:03:48.120> for

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
trophy and so this is my trophy for

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.449 
trophy and so this is my trophy for
spending<00:03:49.170> so<00:03:49.350> much<00:03:49.500> time<00:03:49.530> trying<00:03:50.130> to<00:03:50.220> put<00:03:50.370> it

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
spending so much time trying to put it

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.330 
spending so much time trying to put it
together<00:03:50.550> and<00:03:51.050> inside<00:03:52.050> the<00:03:52.590> jar<00:03:52.860> the<00:03:53.070> Rubik's

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
together and inside the jar the Rubik's

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.729 
together and inside the jar the Rubik's
Cube<00:03:53.580> actually<00:03:53.970> will<00:03:54.209> turn<00:03:54.600> but<00:03:55.350> it'll<00:03:55.590> only

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
Cube actually will turn but it'll only

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.060 
Cube actually will turn but it'll only
turn<00:03:56.100> in<00:03:56.310> kind<00:03:56.700> of<00:03:56.730> this<00:03:56.940> direction<00:03:57.950> you<00:03:58.950> can

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
turn in kind of this direction you can

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.690 
turn in kind of this direction you can
see<00:03:59.250> it<00:03:59.370> turning<00:03:59.610> I<00:04:01.070> gotta<00:04:02.070> get<00:04:02.220> one<00:04:02.310> more<00:04:02.489> turn

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
see it turning I gotta get one more turn

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.920 
see it turning I gotta get one more turn
in<00:04:04.400> you<00:04:05.400> can<00:04:05.580> see<00:04:05.700> how<00:04:05.850> hard<00:04:06.120> how<00:04:06.480> hard<00:04:06.510> it<00:04:06.810> is

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
in you can see how hard how hard it is

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.580 
in you can see how hard how hard it is
to<00:04:06.989> manipulate<00:04:07.430> anything<00:04:08.430> inside<00:04:08.850> this<00:04:09.090> jar

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
to manipulate anything inside this jar

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.870 
to manipulate anything inside this jar
you<00:04:10.590> can<00:04:10.620> barely<00:04:10.950> get<00:04:11.040> my<00:04:11.100> finger<00:04:11.489> in<00:04:11.700> there

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
you can barely get my finger in there

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.780 
you can barely get my finger in there
there<00:04:12.239> we<00:04:12.360> go<00:04:12.480> at<00:04:13.140> that<00:04:13.350> final<00:04:13.650> turn<00:04:13.830> and<00:04:14.370> so

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
there we go at that final turn and so

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.440 
there we go at that final turn and so
yeah<00:04:15.360> it's<00:04:16.080> uh<00:04:16.430> I'm<00:04:17.430> really<00:04:17.820> happy<00:04:18.000> with<00:04:18.269> it

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
yeah it's uh I'm really happy with it

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.500 
yeah it's uh I'm really happy with it
have<00:04:18.570> I<00:04:18.630> said<00:04:18.810> that<00:04:18.959> yet<00:04:19.109> so<00:04:19.669> after<00:04:20.669> you<00:04:21.419> know

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
have I said that yet so after you know

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:22.940 
have I said that yet so after you know
building<00:04:21.900> this<00:04:21.989> one<00:04:22.200> I've<00:04:22.350> actually<00:04:22.410> tried<00:04:22.830> a

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
building this one I've actually tried a

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:23.540 
building this one I've actually tried a
couple

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
couple

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.390 
couple
or<00:04:23.669> and<00:04:24.569> I<00:04:24.900> my<00:04:25.379> brother<00:04:25.590> gave<00:04:25.800> me<00:04:25.830> a<00:04:25.949> second

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
or and I my brother gave me a second

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.939 
or and I my brother gave me a second
door<00:04:26.729> and<00:04:27.000> so<00:04:27.569> in<00:04:28.080> the<00:04:28.289> second<00:04:28.590> jar<00:04:28.710> I<00:04:28.740> actually

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:28.949 
door and so in the second jar I actually

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:33.200 
door and so in the second jar I actually
tried<00:04:29.280> putting<00:04:29.629> this<00:04:31.129> megaminx<00:04:32.129> and<00:04:32.460> I<00:04:33.000> could

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
tried putting this megaminx and I could

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:34.790 
tried putting this megaminx and I could
get<00:04:33.330> the<00:04:33.690> core<00:04:33.900> I<00:04:33.930> started<00:04:34.259> getting<00:04:34.440> the<00:04:34.530> core

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
get the core I started getting the core

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.480 
get the core I started getting the core
together<00:04:35.370> inside<00:04:35.879> of<00:04:36.090> here<00:04:36.360> and<00:04:36.560> I<00:04:37.560> got<00:04:37.979> to<00:04:38.400> the

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
together inside of here and I got to the

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.700 
together inside of here and I got to the
point<00:04:38.639> where<00:04:38.849> I<00:04:38.879> was<00:04:39.330> I<00:04:39.539> could<00:04:39.569> confirm<00:04:40.139> that<00:04:40.440> a

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
point where I was I could confirm that a

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.369 
point where I was I could confirm that a
megamix<00:04:41.370> wouldn't<00:04:41.759> literally<00:04:42.270> fit<00:04:42.599> inside<00:04:42.990> so

00:04:43.369 --> 00:04:43.379 
megamix wouldn't literally fit inside so

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:44.839 
megamix wouldn't literally fit inside so
you<00:04:43.470> can't<00:04:43.740> actually<00:04:43.919> put<00:04:44.220> a<00:04:44.280> make<00:04:44.460> mix<00:04:44.729> in

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:44.849 
you can't actually put a make mix in

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:46.070 
you can't actually put a make mix in
this<00:04:44.970> bottle<00:04:45.270> because<00:04:45.659> this<00:04:45.750> bottle<00:04:46.020> is

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
this bottle because this bottle is

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.499 
this bottle because this bottle is
actually<00:04:46.199> a<00:04:46.409> little<00:04:46.560> too<00:04:46.620> small<00:04:47.099> so<00:04:47.669> I'm<00:04:48.360> not

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:48.509 
actually a little too small so I'm not

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:49.430 
actually a little too small so I'm not
sure<00:04:48.569> what<00:04:48.810> I'm<00:04:48.870> going<00:04:48.960> to<00:04:49.020> do<00:04:49.139> with<00:04:49.259> it<00:04:49.379> I

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
sure what I'm going to do with it I

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.839 
sure what I'm going to do with it I
might<00:04:49.590> make<00:04:49.740> another<00:04:49.770> rubik's<00:04:50.370> cube<00:04:50.580> I<00:04:50.669> might

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:50.849 
might make another rubik's cube I might

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:53.180 
might make another rubik's cube I might
try<00:04:51.030> putting<00:04:51.060> something<00:04:51.569> else<00:04:51.750> in<00:04:51.930> here<00:04:52.190> and

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
try putting something else in here and

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:54.980 
try putting something else in here and
so<00:04:53.610> we'll<00:04:53.789> see<00:04:53.940> what<00:04:54.090> happens<00:04:54.120> with<00:04:54.599> this<00:04:54.720> jar

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
so we'll see what happens with this jar

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.930 
so we'll see what happens with this jar
I'm<00:04:55.800> thinking<00:04:56.069> about<00:04:56.129> maybe<00:04:56.340> trying<00:04:56.639> to<00:04:56.819> get

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
I'm thinking about maybe trying to get

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.490 
I'm thinking about maybe trying to get
the<00:04:57.060> megaminx<00:04:57.449> inside<00:04:57.960> of<00:04:58.080> here

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
the megaminx inside of here

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.459 
the megaminx inside of here
so<00:04:58.949> we'll<00:04:59.250> see<00:04:59.460> what<00:05:00.060> happens<00:05:00.509> but<00:05:01.110> anyway

00:05:01.459 --> 00:05:01.469 
so we'll see what happens but anyway

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:02.600 
so we'll see what happens but anyway
that's<00:05:01.620> pretty<00:05:01.740> much<00:05:02.009> it<00:05:02.219> I<00:05:02.310> hope<00:05:02.460> you<00:05:02.580> guys

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
that's pretty much it I hope you guys

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.360
