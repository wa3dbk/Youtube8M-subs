00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:13.980
 a cordial greeting the customers succeed 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.949
 shop 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:21.000
 in this video I present a couple 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:23.519
 of boxes for a cassation report 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.980
 nixon compatible with most 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.720
 of sony ericsson phones 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.760
 obviously the compatibility card 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.730
 you find it inside the infections 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.520
 we immediately see how the la presents itself 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.690
 cash here we have a small fusco 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.210
 bed that explains the warranty of the 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.680
 regarding the can and the boxes 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.039
 we see very pretty packaging 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.570
 almost looks like a gift box 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:51.120
 actually look at this here 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.440
 the box that would be opened would be evicted 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.559
 Once we have opened it we see that 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:59.449
 the case is presented here in this way 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.449
 let's try to get it out of the bachelor 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:08.729
 here pulling it out of our field it 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.130
 we see that the crate and the boxes are cooked 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.100
 they are gray in color and color 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.140
 here they are, going to open there is a 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.630
 dear friend, that the eti refer firmly to it 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.240
 going to open we have these these 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.759
 casse which here in this way the 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.330
 we place the other end on a table 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.610
 we are going to connect our mobile phone 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.510
 and in this way we can have the 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.790
 possibility to go to 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.710
 listen to the music we would like to 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.710
 practice listening to your mobile 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.270
 the speakers are actually a lot 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.310
 powerful you can't talk 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.410
 listen because they don't have a 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.020
 smile but actually I am a lot 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:50.060
 consistent even if we go to see the 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.480
 weight in actual cases with the material 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.970
 with which they were built and we see 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.730
 that here is a 3.5 attention attack 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.910
 the 3.5 attack of this house is not a 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:04.400
 attack that gives you the chance to 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:07.220
 listen to music maybe on the computer 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.950
 or maybe from another device is 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.330
 simply a connection cable 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.370
 further always if the erickson cannot 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.410
 then maybe the phone is under care 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.300
 but it is being charged at the same time 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.530
 you want to listen to this music 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.730
 stake in pay TV in practice 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.190
 equipment 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.330
 when she was the temptation when 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.580
 you have at school when you bought 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.770
 the mobile phone 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.390
 well I ended the video with this 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.980
 at the entrance of everyone to have them head 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.010
 I listen and give you an appointment at 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.010
 next
