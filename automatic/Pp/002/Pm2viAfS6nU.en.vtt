00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.850
 Every so often we see the image of a 

00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:06.920
 Lynx coming out of a cage and running 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.090
 towards the mountain is usually an act to which 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.039
 authorities and politicians are targeted 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.719
 because it is a success of the projects 

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:13.490
 that are being carried out to avoid 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:15.860
 the extinction of the Iberian lynx a 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.420
 very threatened species but the 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.670
 environmental organizations that lead 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.650
 these projects denounce that 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.760
 It does not do much effort if 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.760
 they die on the roads 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:31.100
 I am the most threatened feline in the world 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:32.360
 there is a little more than 330 and they live in 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.280
 few places on the peninsula 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.580
 Iberian ' Castilla La Mancha Extremadura 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.800
 Andalusia and Portugal these that we see have 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.350
 been bred in captivity and posts in 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.790
 Freedom to meet one year is from 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.450
 from then when they start to be 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:49.280
 guarded by the wwf ngo and the project 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.230
 iberlince coordinated by the board of 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.480
 ANDALUSIA track in which 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.880
 check and control like the lynx 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.470
 Survive in its natural habitat 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.420
 our are the phototrapping cameras 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.540
 that we use we put them in the field 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.890
 evenly distributed in sites by 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.710
 where we know what's going to happen and then 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:10.220
 with the photos with the spots we can 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.260
 identify it say that 90% fits 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.350
 perfectly to life in freedom but 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:18.080
 have to circumvent numerous threats the 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.300
 first of them the lack of food the 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.810
 rabbit population that represents 98 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.520
 percent of your diet is affected 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.130
 continuously for hyper diseases of 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.970
 the 90s entered one called fever 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.150
 viral hemorrhagic 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.730
 that is like Ebola that now 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.890
 we all know but the rabbits and 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.840
 the latter is still very serious every 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.200
 two or three years there is usually an outbreak 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.280
 fat and leaves the populations decimated and 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.530
 although every time we are more 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.710
 aware of the care of this species 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.510
 there are still poachers to the 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.640
 70 something that was called the board 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.430
 extinction of vermin that the government 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.730
 paid people for killing not only 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.680
 lynx go eagles foxes 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.960
 since the late 70s it is protected 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.690
 but those practices have continued until 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.060
 day but the most lethal weapons with the 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.820
 Lynxes do not know how to aim but they go to 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:15.600
 four wheels the abuses have passed 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:19.500
 from about five a year to 21 in 2014 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.210
 wwf asks for more caution and above all that 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.030
 the scrub is removed from the margins of 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:26.340
 the roads and that the roads go and 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.460
 signal adequately for the crisis 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.110
 economic We are not getting that 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.640
 fix the roads what we come 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.830
 asking in the last two years 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.830
 insistently to the Ministry of Development 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.930
 to the public works council of the 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.240
 junta andalusia for this matter 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.430
 wwf has filed a complaint with the 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.230
 European Commission wants to prevent 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.960
 efforts of recent years that have 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:52.130
 triplicated the Iberian lynx population 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.130
 fall in a broken sack
