00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.090
 those who make themselves do for three 

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:07.819
 we always say it especially when it is there 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:10.280
 she so thanks to cuffaro well again 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:12.560
 good morning and nothing to resemble you do 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.840
 knowing how to make movement projects for 

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:17.359
 the happy degrowth that will tell us today 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:20.150
 because it is necessary to do at home i 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:22.550
 detergents then you need one because 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.170
 economically save 2 health is 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.940
 fundamental we make a product that 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.490
 he is not aggressive with his hands because a 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.140
 lemon base salt vinegar and soap of 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.870
 Marseille a little water so right 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.340
 simple indeed recalls allergies we avoid 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.440
 psoriasis recall a lot of things 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.030
 absolutely more is also a product 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.489
 fun to want to give away 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.159
 economic but also economic but look a 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:45.559
 not even a euro for a liter a kilo 

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:47.510
 about gaining patience then 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.760
 let's get down to work but has it then 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.920
 let's start by taking three nice but lemons 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.659
 mature and broken would not be good too 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.879
 a little bruised the important thing is that 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:57.799
 are not particularly green there 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:01.760
 we must cut into small pieces into 

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:03.319
 small squares, rondelle pieces 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.200
 quite indifferent squares 

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:07.880
 we must then blend and insert them 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.650
 inside a mixer or a 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.480
 in this way we do not have a blender 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.560
 already prepared in but then see 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.900
 the size is more or less than one 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.400
 centimeter and a half bit like that 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.150
 we waste less energy 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.150
 then we whine 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.580
 but we must add 300 thousand 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.460
 200 grams 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.090
 Yes No 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.090
 no I do n't say anything 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.620
 white after we have blended maybe 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.050
 if we need we can put ourselves 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.150
 even a drop of water this momix 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:43.010
 then he managed to do just that 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.010
 he thought a juice that you do instead 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.780
 super efficient but also very natural 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.119
 then we spend everything in a beautiful way 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.040
 pot the important thing is that our the 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.259
 our pot is not made of aluminum 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.990
 because aluminum reacts a lemon 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.369
 then we add the first time I have it 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.710
 made in aluminum it came green 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.880
 detergent then we add the recent 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.979
 and bears 300 milliliters of water 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:11.459
 add about 200 grams of salt 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.180
 up and the classic 50 g of soap 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.180
 Marseilles 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.070
 here and 200 thousand liters of vinegar 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.489
 white so I have to say we have it 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:22.860
 these products generally in the home 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:26.580
 simple we have to light the fire 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:29.130
 ok perfect and then turn every 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.440
 otherwise it will stick to the so 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.180
 we are going to cook the demo cooks 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.489
 because cooking allows a long time 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.230
 conservation of the product not the oval 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.299
 that resists at least a month would seem 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.570
 a long time we have to leave them around 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:44.459
 half an hour without lid removed we write down 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.380
 when it boils we bring it to soak 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.970
 so it's just slightly boiling 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.040
 begin to simmer we hold about one 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.390
 half an hour the time that thickens and that 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.519
 become a homogeneous cream 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.680
 we have a little bit because the vinegar if there 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.870
 let's put it this way it can be a bit annoying 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.590
 after about half an hour we have this 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.690
 result 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.870
 as you can see it is slightly haber it seems 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.579
 a darkened cream and if we want a 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.140
 even more velvety product than 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:10.500
 looks just like custard 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.960
 we give ourselves another blender pass 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.190
 in this way 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.650
 so that they give even more 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.540
 velvety, however, the first few times it is 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.890
 I did it was so velvety and 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.620
 soft that looked like a cream 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.960
 then a pastry chef from yesterday already suffered 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:30.570
 tried I forgot I put my finger 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:33.300
 tasted then you're almost as intact as 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:36.570
 midst of a cover and that pretty networks 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.520
 which really comes very soft then 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.890
 sky finally or in a 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.660
 dispenser a part let's say I put it 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.670
 one part does not dispense in plastic and 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.760
 mental than on our spine tina 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.500
 We dislike the product and ready to 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.290
 the other part in the glass jar 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.420
 where it stays for longer 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.940
 recharging here there is the refill go 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.970
 good both to wash by hand i 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.980
 dishes or and I can also tell you the 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.990
 yes because at the same the ancient product 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.000
 and sponge we put 12 sforzini with 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.520
 this way and dishwasher instead 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.990
 we think more or less 2 3 tbsp is though 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.190
 if you tell me about a dishwasher I tell you 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:12.810
 that the star also serves the 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.430
 rinse aid also serves not drinking 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.260
 so brilliant 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.180
 eh si also here we always go on 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.430
 very natural products we can 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.500
 touch without gloves absolutely 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.600
 because while those we buy in 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:28.080
 trade are very aggressive us 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:30.720
 those we use today we can 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.700
 touch and it does not bother us what you 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.530
 I will say lemon and salt also make it there 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.990
 scrub alemanno and bind us the smell of 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.220
 garlic fish we cooked there 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.530
 therefore we also gain the ace 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.850
 we really remove the gloves and not them 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.830
 we use figures 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:46.980
 now for the rinse aid instead 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.570
 we use citric acid which is also 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:50.600
 this is very natural because it comes 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:53.930
 extracted from citrus fruits from 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:56.180
 the lemon the orange the cedar this year 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.530
 acid that has descaling power 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.730
 in fact we also use it in ours 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:02.450
 quarterback 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:05.090
 we take about 160 grams we do 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:07.910
 a solution about 15 percent and the 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:11.660
 we put in 840 grams so not 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:13.280
 milliliters g of distilled water, 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:16.220
 classic one of the iron 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.990
 if we also want to save water 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.970
 we can do it with that 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.170
 rain if we do not live right at the 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:23.750
 Town center 

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:25.570
 once boiled filtered the 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:28.040
 we can use also in this case 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:30.200
 so we put it inside the 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.870
 our bottle and we also use it 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:35.270
 in this case in the dishwasher in step 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:37.670
 of simple rinse aid and we put it 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:40.310
 say a cup more or less then 

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:43.460
 we shake him a little now 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:46.010
 unfolded and citric acid are at all 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.690
 wet with perfect but don't say though 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:49.720
 therefore it does not hurt the skin 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:52.910
 now I go directly to the dishwasher 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:55.490
 thanks lucia brightening and subversive 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:57.349
 for the fantastic cocks 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:59.830
 see you morally and economically on Sunday 

00:05:57.349 --> 00:05:59.830
 test
