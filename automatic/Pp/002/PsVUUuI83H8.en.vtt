00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.679
 it will have standard powdered hazelnuts 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:25.039
 they are little known to whole hazelnuts that one will be physical 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.649
 to put me on the cake ap 4 250000 TV 

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:33.780
 100 grams alain brown sugar brown sugar or square for example 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:34.829
 if greece 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.290
 three beautiful pearls 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:37.800
 a bag of crisps 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.460
 full of chemical warfare 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.660
 do not be afraid of 250 grams of flour 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.250
 school 100 grams of butter that will melt in the microwave it will take 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.150
 also 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.540
 halloween so 250 grams of flour 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.970
 we're going to start simply do not preheat the oven to 180 degrees 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.790
 and we will now mix all the ingredients 13 that is to say that 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.620
 make 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.620
 baking powder 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.960
 meyer sugar 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.960
 so I put three sachets of sugar proportionately 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.130
 of sugar them jimmy the brown sugar m 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.050
 so why is he talking now 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.320
 charged as long as you feel these illegal and illegal camps 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.160
 gradually 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.480
 surprising gericault surrounds 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.480
 it was clearly 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:19.689
 his presence will buy back 10% per year 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:33.079
 so here's on a stable note for the moment 

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:44.339
 here is added the fondue preparation 

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:54.689
 so do not prepare now that I'm going to pray like italy what his 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:55.560
 successor 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.589
 but the pursuit this veto 

00:02:57.589 --> 00:03:00.589
 it has three poles 

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:05.389
 he then does 

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:07.919
 in small cubes 

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:11.169
 irregular it's the goal of the game it's really about having a cake as well 

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:12.449
 rustic 

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:15.729
 afp has adequate carrez 

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:17.839
 iphone to acts he was 

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:20.839
 so the dark haired maidens 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:30.370
 arriving at a point on acrylics on canvas 

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:48.419
 and of course Canada's decision is 

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:49.680
 so I will know 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.039
 generously on the table 

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:55.539
 She died 

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:58.899
 here I go I mix of flavors we will let them marinate a good 

00:03:58.899 --> 00:04:01.899
 half an hour and then we take again the hand following 

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:07.569
 the last attack against this measure 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:10.569
 for this one after the flight 

00:04:11.649 --> 00:04:13.089
 more convenient for them 

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:14.909
 I'm not going right now 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:18.049
 it connects Ngiti stupor that I have a little sometimes have guts 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.370
 for two years she fanning 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.360
 cakes and drinks more easily 

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:53.659
 for the rest we are not going yet but angelic 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:59.639
 in the preparation 

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:03.909
 so that you can eventually let canada be 

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:06.050
 equivalent of perfumery 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.050
 I still thought of parking meters 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:16.389
 in the preparation we mix everything 

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:22.240
 as these note that the drill preheated to 180 degrees 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.370
 who is ready to welcome him the phaeton 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.370
 in place the preparation 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.990
 not really what makes the originality of this cake is that it was a 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:35.779
 race not bad spoken with hazelnuts 

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:38.779
 it's really very very nice and textures 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:41.389
 to treasure the past at all 

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:43.610
 I think you are going 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.610
 that's when dell does not really need that 

00:05:48.309 --> 00:05:50.029
 thirty-five minutes and powerful 

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:53.029
 we go 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.550
 so if you have adinfo associate this info 

00:06:00.249 --> 00:06:02.199
 so I'm going to leave but my cake 

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:04.309
 sugar 

00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:06.830
 Saint-Camille scene for very very good 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.240
 by the magic of cancer 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.569
 on top of the cake 

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:15.569
 it had to be generous 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.310
 superb because everything is ready so we'll put it in the oven for 20 35 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:28.860
 minutes 180 degrees and I find again just now for the same result 

00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:31.860
 and that's it after 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.409
 they do not have all the shops and brands of gruissan 

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:37.409
 our cake seems ready to be devoured 

00:06:40.689 --> 00:06:43.499
 obama explaining greece 

00:06:43.499 --> 00:06:44.389
 see this year 

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:45.479
 soccer 

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:48.189
 very nice yet to watch with afp 

00:06:48.189 --> 00:06:49.409
 to taste 

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:52.020
 so let's cool a little bit 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:53.680
 then we have been developing since 2002 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:54.979
 enjoy it 

00:06:54.979 --> 00:06:56.980
 because I wish you well 

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:58.759
