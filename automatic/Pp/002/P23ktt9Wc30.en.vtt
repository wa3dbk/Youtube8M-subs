case<00:03:04.180> now<00:03:04.930> this<00:03:05.380> cost<00:03:05.560> $25<00:03:06.550> at<00:03:06.820> the<00:03:07.230> that's<00:03:08.230> a

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
case now this cost $25 at the that's a

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.530 
case now this cost $25 at the that's a
local<00:03:08.709> t-mobile<00:03:09.010> store<00:03:09.370> or<00:03:09.730> AT&amp;T<00:03:10.090> store

wherever<00:03:10.870> you<00:03:11.080> plan<00:03:11.290> on<00:03:11.470> buying<00:03:11.590> it<00:03:11.769> from<00:03:11.950> I

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
wherever you plan on buying it from I

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.120 
wherever you plan on buying it from I
didn't<00:03:13.300> pay<00:03:13.420> $25<00:03:14.170> for<00:03:14.230> this<00:03:14.470> ordered<00:03:15.040> it

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
didn't pay $25 for this ordered it

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.020 
didn't pay $25 for this ordered it
online<00:03:15.280> for<00:03:15.670> $6<00:03:16.300> actually<00:03:17.250> anyway<00:03:18.250> so<00:03:18.940> it's

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
online for $6 actually anyway so it's

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.740 
online for $6 actually anyway so it's
got<00:03:19.150> the<00:03:19.269> corners<00:03:19.750> here<00:03:20.140> if<00:03:20.230> when<00:03:20.440> you<00:03:20.500> drop<00:03:20.860> it

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
got the corners here if when you drop it

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.800 
got the corners here if when you drop it
it<00:03:22.750> uh<00:03:22.900> or<00:03:23.530> some<00:03:23.890> other<00:03:24.010> shot<00:03:24.310> there<00:03:24.640> but<00:03:25.390> I

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
it uh or some other shot there but I

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.750 
it uh or some other shot there but I
think<00:03:26.170> this<00:03:26.260> is<00:03:26.440> a<00:03:26.470> great<00:03:26.860> case<00:03:27.370> for<00:03:27.400> the

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
think this is a great case for the

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.300 
think this is a great case for the
iPhone<00:03:28.090> 5<00:03:28.330> it's<00:03:28.690> still<00:03:28.900> nice<00:03:29.110> and<00:03:29.380> thin<00:03:29.680> and

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
iPhone 5 it's still nice and thin and

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.100 
iPhone 5 it's still nice and thin and
you<00:03:30.850> can<00:03:30.880> see<00:03:31.120> the<00:03:31.239> difference<00:03:31.600> in<00:03:31.750> design

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
you can see the difference in design

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.490 
you can see the difference in design
there's<00:03:32.620> pretty<00:03:32.920> much<00:03:32.980> the<00:03:33.340> same<00:03:33.580> as<00:03:34.030> before

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
there's pretty much the same as before

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.690 
there's pretty much the same as before
they<00:03:35.500> just<00:03:35.650> kind<00:03:35.830> of<00:03:35.860> upped<00:03:36.100> it<00:03:36.250> a<00:03:36.280> little<00:03:36.489> bit

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
they just kind of upped it a little bit

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.560 
they just kind of upped it a little bit
and<00:03:37.769> took<00:03:38.769> away<00:03:38.920> the<00:03:39.070> two-piece<00:03:39.850> because<00:03:40.360> when

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
and took away the two-piece because when

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.240 
and took away the two-piece because when
you<00:03:40.660> drop<00:03:41.019> when<00:03:41.320> I<00:03:41.380> would<00:03:41.500> drop<00:03:41.680> this<00:03:41.920> it<00:03:42.130> will

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
you drop when I would drop this it will

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.160 
you drop when I would drop this it will
break<00:03:42.790> into<00:03:43.120> pieces<00:03:43.300> and<00:03:43.600> will<00:03:43.690> come<00:03:43.840> apart

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
break into pieces and will come apart

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.470 
break into pieces and will come apart
but<00:03:44.830> this<00:03:45.010> one<00:03:45.160> obviously<00:03:45.340> is<00:03:45.700> not<00:03:46.090> gonna<00:03:46.330> be

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
but this one obviously is not gonna be

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.449 
but this one obviously is not gonna be
like<00:03:46.690> that<00:03:47.310> so<00:03:48.600> that<00:03:49.600> is<00:03:49.720> a<00:03:49.750> look<00:03:50.019> at<00:03:50.350> the<00:03:50.920> newer

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
like that so that is a look at the newer

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:53.400 
like that so that is a look at the newer
style<00:03:51.820> body<00:03:52.390> glove<00:03:52.600> and<00:03:52.810> these<00:03:52.900> are<00:03:53.050> these

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
style body glove and these are these

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.320 
style body glove and these are these
aren't<00:03:53.590> actually<00:03:53.950> new<00:03:54.190> you<00:03:55.030> see<00:03:55.150> where<00:03:55.269> you

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.330 
aren't actually new you see where you

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:56.580 
aren't actually new you see where you
can<00:03:55.420> get<00:03:55.690> them<00:03:55.840> from<00:03:56.080> there<00:03:56.290> if<00:03:56.380> you're<00:03:56.470> gonna

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
can get them from there if you're gonna

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.949 
can get them from there if you're gonna
actually<00:03:56.980> order<00:03:57.280> from<00:03:57.549> the<00:03:57.700> manufacturer<00:03:58.510> or

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.500 
well this is a bit of a slippery case
but<00:04:19.320> at<00:04:19.410> the<00:04:19.470> same<00:04:19.650> time<00:04:19.950> it<00:04:20.639> has<00:04:20.880> so<00:04:21.060> it<00:04:21.239> adds

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
but at the same time it has so it adds

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.180 
but at the same time it has so it adds
something<00:04:22.079> to<00:04:22.230> the<00:04:22.410> iPhone<00:04:22.710> that<00:04:22.860> it<00:04:22.950> needs

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
something to the iPhone that it needs

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.490 
something to the iPhone that it needs
which<00:04:23.550> is<00:04:23.580> some<00:04:23.880> some<00:04:24.450> heft<00:04:24.750> to<00:04:24.870> it<00:04:24.960> some<00:04:25.230> death

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
which is some some heft to it some death

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.800 
which is some some heft to it some death
to<00:04:25.770> it<00:04:25.889> it<00:04:26.160> feels<00:04:26.190> really<00:04:26.580> good<00:04:26.850> so<00:04:27.780> I

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
to it it feels really good so I

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.420 
to it it feels really good so I
definitely<00:04:28.320> feel<00:04:28.800> like<00:04:28.830> my<00:04:28.950> phone<00:04:29.280> is

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
definitely feel like my phone is

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.050 
definitely feel like my phone is
