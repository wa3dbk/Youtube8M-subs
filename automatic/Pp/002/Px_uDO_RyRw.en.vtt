 usually these of the formula of coca-cola is an enigma and there are 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.339
 Several legends about this famous drink 

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:46.300
 another very curious fact is that coca-cola has 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.599
 many blessings to all the parties in power 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:51.339
 there goes the text 

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:56.929
 the first delivery of coca-cola was the coca-cola cherry in 1985 based on the 

00:03:56.929 --> 00:04:00.359

 the American and replaced by the coca-cola blackberry boy 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.600
 then the Coca-Cola entity continues in 2004 perhaps in response to the 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.600
 Growing popularity of the low carb diet
