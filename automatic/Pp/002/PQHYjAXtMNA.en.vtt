00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
now here comes that critical mass I was

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.999 
now here comes that critical mass I was
talking<00:01:51.690> about<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:52.290> point<00:01:52.530> where<00:01:52.710> Hardy

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
talking about the point where Hardy

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.410 
talking about the point where Hardy
reaches<00:01:53.310> his<00:01:53.460> critical<00:01:53.790> mass<00:01:53.910> where<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.300> can

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
reaches his critical mass where you can

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.020 
reaches his critical mass where you can
just<00:01:54.660> really<00:01:54.810> start<00:01:55.050> pumping<00:01:55.470> an<00:01:55.560> army<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.069> I

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
just really start pumping an army and I

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.999

think<00:01:57.509> Marines<00:01:57.810> gonna<00:01:58.020> be<00:01:58.140> okay<00:01:58.530> with<00:01:58.830> the

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
think Marines gonna be okay with the

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.309 
think Marines gonna be okay with the
amount<00:01:59.250> of<00:01:59.660> defensive<00:02:00.660> structures<00:02:01.080> he<00:02:01.200> has

00:02:01.309 --> 00:02:01.319 
amount of defensive structures he has

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:04.539 
amount of defensive structures he has
here<00:02:01.590> that's<00:02:01.920> such<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.130> wide<00:02:02.520> sunken<00:02:03.140> yeah

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
here that's such a wide sunken yeah

here that's such a wide sunken yeah
he's<00:02:04.880> so<00:02:05.210> tough<00:02:05.750> to<00:02:05.990> break<00:02:06.170> and<00:02:06.439> then<00:02:06.530> the

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
he's so tough to break and then the

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.279 
he's so tough to break and then the
guardians<00:02:07.130> behind<00:02:07.520> it<00:02:07.789> that's<00:02:08.420> just<00:02:08.569> I<00:02:08.899> mean

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.650 
can't rush just make sense
yeah<00:06:30.100> see<00:06:30.400> marine<00:06:30.700> is<00:06:30.910> the<00:06:31.030> most<00:06:31.210> aggressive

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:31.660 
yeah see marine is the most aggressive

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.720 
yeah see marine is the most aggressive
player<00:06:32.170> really<00:06:32.680> in<00:06:32.770> the<00:06:32.830> fastest<00:06:33.250> community

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:33.730 
player really in the fastest community

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:36.570 
player really in the fastest community
so<00:06:34.480> mid-range<00:06:34.930> action<00:06:35.410> probably<00:06:35.920> about<00:06:36.100> I

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:36.580 
so mid-range action probably about I

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:39.750 
so mid-range action probably about I
mean<00:06:37.000> I<00:06:37.870> think<00:06:38.830> it's<00:06:39.100> I<00:06:39.280> think<00:06:39.310> it's<00:06:39.550> a<00:06:39.580> pretty

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:39.760 
mean I think it's I think it's a pretty

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.700 
mean I think it's I think it's a pretty
consensus<00:06:40.510> feeling<00:06:40.960> that<00:06:41.110> marine<00:06:41.350> is<00:06:41.560> the

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:41.710 
consensus feeling that marine is the

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:43.050 
consensus feeling that marine is the
best<00:06:41.950> player<00:06:42.250> at<00:06:42.520> early<00:06:42.820> game

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:43.060 
best player at early game

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.150 
best player at early game
I<00:06:43.330> don't<00:06:44.080> know<00:06:44.230> anybody<00:06:44.680> that's<00:06:44.860> been<00:06:44.980> as

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:45.160 
I don't know anybody that's been as

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.060 
I don't know anybody that's been as
dominant<00:06:45.370> as<00:06:45.820> marine<00:06:46.480> early<00:06:46.870> game<00:06:47.080> so<00:06:47.350> hard<00:06:47.950> he

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:48.070 
dominant as marine early game so hard he

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:50.010 
dominant as marine early game so hard he
really<00:06:48.610> didn't<00:06:49.060> care<00:06:49.120> about<00:06:49.540> taking<00:06:49.720> this<00:06:49.900> to

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:50.020 
really didn't care about taking this to

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:51.300 
really didn't care about taking this to
a<00:06:50.080> long<00:06:50.260> game<00:06:50.410> I<00:06:50.470> think<00:06:50.680> he<00:06:50.740> feels<00:06:50.950> that's<00:06:51.160> an

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:51.310 
a long game I think he feels that's an

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:53.030 
a long game I think he feels that's an
advantage<00:06:51.550> for

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:53.040 
advantage for

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:56.550 
advantage for
and<00:06:54.040> of<00:06:54.940> course<00:06:55.240> we're<00:06:55.419> sending<00:06:56.260> out<00:06:56.410> all

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:56.560 
and of course we're sending out all

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.530 
and of course we're sending out all
planes<00:06:56.860> and<00:06:57.160> hopefully<00:06:57.520> skimmers<00:06:57.880> are<00:06:58.090> they

00:06:58.530 --> 00:06:58.540 
planes and hopefully skimmers are they

00:06:58.540 --> 00:06:59.850 
planes and hopefully skimmers are they
both<00:06:58.690> went<00:06:58.960> through<00:06:59.110> this<00:06:59.199> great

00:06:59.850 --> 00:06:59.860 
both went through this great

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:02.100 
both went through this great
I<00:06:59.889> mean<00:07:00.130> training<00:07:00.580> method<00:07:00.880> to<00:07:01.000> say<00:07:01.330> but<00:07:01.960> now

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:02.110 
I mean training method to say but now

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:05.020 
you got extreme arena 4000 minerals I

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:06.480 
you got extreme arena 4000 minerals I
knew<00:07:05.169> that<00:07:05.290> was<00:07:05.410> gonna<00:07:05.470> happen<00:07:05.590> he<00:07:06.010> has<00:07:06.040> to<00:07:06.310> get

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:06.490
