I'm<00:00:58.440> going<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.039> be<00:00:59.100> testing<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.550> water<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.120> I

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
I'm going to be testing the water and I

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.450 
I'm going to be testing the water and I
usually<00:01:00.780> carry<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.289> tiler<00:01:01.649> test<00:01:01.920> kit<00:01:02.129> with<00:01:02.280> me

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.520 
usually carry a tiler test kit with me
it<00:01:02.760> is<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:03.059> most<00:01:03.090> accurate<00:01:03.539> unless<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:04.320> come

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
it is the most accurate unless you come

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.289 
it is the most accurate unless you come
into<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.830> store<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.220> have<00:01:05.670> your<00:01:05.790> chemicals

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
pH reading and on this one it says to

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.760 
pH reading and on this one it says to
put<00:01:28.770> five<00:01:29.040> drops<00:01:30.439> you<00:01:31.439> put<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.740> lid<00:01:31.920> back<00:01:31.950> on

put five drops you put the lid back on

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.069 
put five drops you put the lid back on
shake<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:34.920> up<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.159> little<00:01:35.340> bit<00:01:35.579> I<00:01:35.939> don't<00:01:36.840> know<00:01:36.960> if

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
shake it up a little bit I don't know if

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.590 
shake it up a little bit I don't know if
you<00:01:37.229> can<00:01:37.290> really<00:01:37.439> tell<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.799> color<00:01:38.360> but<00:01:39.360> the

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
you can really tell that color but the

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.280 
you can really tell that color but the
pH<00:01:39.900> is<00:01:40.140> low<00:01:40.670> which<00:01:41.670> with<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.000> green<00:01:42.390> pool<00:01:42.659> is<00:01:43.020> not

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
pH is low which with a green pool is not

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.550 
pH is low which with a green pool is not
a<00:01:43.320> bad<00:01:43.649> thing

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:57.410 

I'm<00:01:49.560> also<00:01:49.799> going<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.299> check<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.450> chlorine<00:01:56.420> it

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
I'm also going to check the chlorine it

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.980 
I'm also going to check the chlorine it
also<00:01:57.659> has<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.140> maximum<00:01:58.740> line<00:02:02.570> the<00:02:03.570> chlorine

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
also has a maximum line the chlorine

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.200 
also has a maximum line the chlorine
also<00:02:04.229> has<00:02:04.649> its<00:02:04.860> own<00:02:04.979> reagent<00:02:05.670> as<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:06.000> Hemme

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
also has its own reagent as you Hemme

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.940 
also has its own reagent as you Hemme
drops<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:06.810> put<00:02:06.990> in<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.229> water<00:02:07.440> to<00:02:07.680> get<00:02:07.799> the

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
drops to put in the water to get the

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.940 
drops to put in the water to get the
accurate<00:02:08.069> reading<00:02:09.140> with<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.259> chlorine<00:02:10.649> it<00:02:10.830> is

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
accurate reading with the chlorine it is

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:20.130 
accurate reading with the chlorine it is
five<00:02:11.220> drops

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.650 

we<00:02:20.710> have<00:02:20.890> no<00:02:21.100> chlorine<00:02:21.400> reading<00:02:21.940> as<00:02:22.300> you<00:02:22.330> can

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
we have no chlorine reading as you can

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.540 
we have no chlorine reading as you can
see<00:02:22.840> it's<00:02:23.020> white<00:02:23.260> if<00:02:23.680> we<00:02:24.010> had<00:02:24.190> a<00:02:24.220> chlorine

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
see it's white if we had a chlorine

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.590 
see it's white if we had a chlorine
reading<00:02:25.120> and<00:02:25.300> the<00:02:25.840> chlorine<00:02:26.110> is<00:02:27.240> should<00:02:28.240> be<00:02:28.420> at

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
reading and the chlorine is should be at

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.790 
reading and the chlorine is should be at
3.0<00:02:30.000> so<00:02:31.000> in<00:02:31.330> this<00:02:31.540> case<00:02:31.810> what<00:02:32.080> we<00:02:32.230> want<00:02:32.470> to<00:02:32.620> do

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
3.0 so in this case what we want to do

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.720 
3.0 so in this case what we want to do
is<00:02:33.630> boost<00:02:34.630> the<00:02:34.930> chlorine<00:02:35.380> and<00:02:35.710> leave<00:02:36.220> the<00:02:36.400> pH

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
is boost the chlorine and leave the pH

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.180 
is boost the chlorine and leave the pH
low<00:02:37.090> to<00:02:37.810> clear<00:02:38.050> up<00:02:38.200> the<00:02:38.350> green<00:02:38.560> pool<00:02:38.800> and<00:02:39.100> to

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
low to clear up the green pool and to

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.700 
low to clear up the green pool and to
kill<00:02:39.400> the<00:02:39.520> algae
