accidentally made watch oops that didn't

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.910 
accidentally made watch oops that didn't
work<00:00:44.670> very<00:00:44.730> well<00:00:44.969> hold<00:00:45.450> on<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.600> second

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:57.370 

okay<00:00:52.480> now<00:00:53.480> watch<00:00:54.280> see<00:00:56.050> okay<00:00:57.050> I'm

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:57.380 
okay now watch see okay I'm

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.200 
okay now watch see okay I'm
transformation<00:00:58.750> then<00:01:00.790> you<00:01:01.790> can<00:01:01.880> take<00:01:02.030> the

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
transformation then you can take the

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.120 
transformation then you can take the
front<00:01:02.800> split<00:01:03.800> split<00:01:04.489> it<00:01:04.670> in<00:01:04.790> half<00:01:05.560> then<00:01:06.560> you're

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
front split split it in half then you're

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.650 
front split split it in half then you're
going<00:01:07.280> to<00:01:07.480> take<00:01:08.480> this<00:01:08.780> part<00:01:09.170> flip<00:01:10.010> it<00:01:10.130> down<00:01:10.660> so

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:11.660 
going to take this part flip it down so

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.410 
going to take this part flip it down so
it<00:01:11.690> goes<00:01:11.900> in<00:01:12.140> between<00:01:12.320> the<00:01:12.620> front<00:01:13.420> portions

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
it goes in between the front portions

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:22.330 
it goes in between the front portions
and<00:01:15.430> then<00:01:17.080> you<00:01:18.080> turn<00:01:18.380> it<00:01:18.410> up<00:01:19.180> fold<00:01:20.180> it<00:01:21.130> so<00:01:22.130> that

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
and then you turn it up fold it so that

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:30.100 
and then you turn it up fold it so that
then<00:01:22.610> the<00:01:23.420> headrests<00:01:25.450> neatly<00:01:28.420> just<00:01:29.420> above<00:01:29.869> the

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
then the headrests neatly just above the

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:40.590 
then the headrests neatly just above the
chest<00:01:31.060> and<00:01:32.060> then<00:01:32.330> no

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.410 

and<00:01:41.600> then<00:01:41.780> you<00:01:42.050> just<00:01:42.550> rotate<00:01:43.550> the<00:01:43.820> arm<00:01:44.030> so<00:01:44.390> that

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
and then you just rotate the arm so that

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.200 
and then you just rotate the arm so that
the<00:01:44.750> shoulders<00:01:45.200> are<00:01:45.440> in<00:01:45.530> place<00:01:45.800> and<00:01:47.290> then<00:01:48.290> fold

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
the shoulders are in place and then fold

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:59.950 
the shoulders are in place and then fold
yeah<00:01:54.160> when<00:01:55.160> you<00:01:55.280> fold<00:01:55.610> the<00:01:58.360> hands<00:01:59.360> up<00:01:59.510> and<00:01:59.720> one

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
yeah when you fold the hands up and one

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.050 
yeah when you fold the hands up and one
of<00:01:59.990> them<00:02:00.170> you<00:02:00.350> have<00:02:00.470> to<00:02:00.560> rotate<00:02:01.250> so<00:02:01.820> that's

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
of them you have to rotate so that's

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.670 
of them you have to rotate so that's
like<00:02:02.570> the<00:02:02.720> other<00:02:02.840> one<00:02:04.150> and<00:02:05.150> then<00:02:05.540> you<00:02:06.530> take

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
like the other one and then you take

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.029 
like the other one and then you take
that<00:02:06.920> pc<00:02:07.700> took<00:02:08.000> off<00:02:08.209> and<00:02:08.770> stick<00:02:09.770> it<00:02:09.800> to<00:02:09.950> the

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
that pc took off and stick it to the

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.160 
that pc took off and stick it to the
chest<00:02:10.280> and<00:02:11.140> then<00:02:13.450> you<00:02:14.450> turn<00:02:14.660> the<00:02:14.900> front

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
chest and then you turn the front

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.250 
chest and then you turn the front
portions<00:02:15.650> out<00:02:15.800> straight<00:02:16.670> so<00:02:17.660> it<00:02:17.750> makes<00:02:17.900> feet

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
portions out straight so it makes feet

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.130 
portions out straight so it makes feet
and<00:02:19.000> then<00:02:20.000> what<00:02:20.150> I<00:02:20.180> like<00:02:20.330> to<00:02:20.660> do<00:02:20.780> to<00:02:20.930> make<00:02:21.020> it

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
and then what I like to do to make it

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.660 
and then what I like to do to make it
look<00:02:21.230> even<00:02:21.470> I<00:02:22.420> could<00:02:23.420> take<00:02:24.230> this<00:02:25.190> out<00:02:25.459> of<00:02:25.489> the

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
look even I could take this out of the

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:32.650 
look even I could take this out of the
top<00:02:25.970> hole<00:02:27.160> and<00:02:30.459> place<00:02:31.459> it<00:02:31.700> in<00:02:31.880> the<00:02:31.910> bottom<00:02:32.420> hole

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
top hole and place it in the bottom hole

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.420 
top hole and place it in the bottom hole
just<00:02:32.900> like<00:02:33.020> the<00:02:33.290> other<00:02:33.440> one<00:02:33.680> so<00:02:33.890> it's<00:02:34.040> even

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
just like the other one so it's even

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:46.330 
just like the other one so it's even
looking<00:02:36.070> and<00:02:38.260> here<00:02:39.489> is<00:02:40.510> bumblebee

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.539 

he<00:02:47.340> has<00:02:48.000> really<00:02:48.360> good<00:02:48.569> articulation<00:02:49.340> at<00:02:50.340> least

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
he has really good articulation at least

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:52.850 
he has really good articulation at least
I<00:02:50.670> think<00:02:50.849> he<00:02:50.939> does<00:02:51.150> you<00:02:51.959> can<00:02:52.140> rotate<00:02:52.319> his<00:02:52.590> feet

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
I think he does you can rotate his feet

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.110 
I think he does you can rotate his feet
a<00:02:52.890> full<00:02:53.250> 360<00:02:54.290> you<00:02:55.290> can<00:02:55.500> bend<00:02:55.980> it<00:02:56.129> to<00:02:56.189> me<00:02:56.459> you<00:02:56.970> can

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
a full 360 you can bend it to me you can

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.569 
a full 360 you can bend it to me you can
rotate<00:02:57.599> it<00:02:58.019> me<00:02:59.299> you<00:03:00.299> can<00:03:00.540> move<00:03:01.110> and<00:03:01.560> full<00:03:02.220> range

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
rotate it me you can move and full range

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:08.059 
rotate it me you can move and full range
at<00:03:02.849> the<00:03:02.879> hip<00:03:04.159> his<00:03:05.159> arms<00:03:06.120> a<00:03:06.530> really<00:03:07.530> good<00:03:07.739> to

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
at the hip his arms a really good to

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:14.780 
at the hip his arms a really good to
kill<00:03:08.340> ish<00:03:08.549> and<00:03:11.390> move<00:03:12.390> around<00:03:12.569> a<00:03:12.810> folder<00:03:13.790> bend

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
kill ish and move around a folder bend

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.119 
kill ish and move around a folder bend
at<00:03:14.939> the<00:03:14.970> elbow<00:03:15.450> bend<00:03:15.930> at<00:03:16.049> the<00:03:16.079> wrist<00:03:16.500> twist<00:03:16.920> to
