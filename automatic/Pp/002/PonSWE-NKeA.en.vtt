comparison just we brought in binaltech

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.029 
comparison just we brought in binaltech
Grimlock<00:00:20.820> on<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.240> on<00:00:21.449> your<00:00:21.510> right<00:00:21.840> there<00:00:22.080> yeah

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
there can protect to protect himself now

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.609

as<00:01:39.000> far<00:01:39.210> has<00:01:39.659> his<00:01:40.079> offensive<00:01:41.659> weapons<00:01:42.659> you<00:01:43.439> saw

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
as far has his offensive weapons you saw

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.690 
as far has his offensive weapons you saw
this<00:01:43.770> before<00:01:43.920> this<00:01:44.280> is<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.960> engine<00:01:45.960> block<00:01:46.700> and

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
this before this is the engine block and

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.520 
this before this is the engine block and
what<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.540> actually<00:01:48.570> does<00:01:48.869> is<00:01:48.930> it<00:01:49.079> houses<00:01:49.439> the

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
what it actually does is it houses the

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.350 
what it actually does is it houses the
battery<00:01:49.619> for<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.189> lights<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.850> sounds

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
battery for the lights and the sounds

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.910 
battery for the lights and the sounds
and<00:01:51.590> so<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:53.310> side<00:01:53.820> skirts<00:01:54.090> actually<00:01:54.920> are

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
and so the side skirts actually are

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.850 
and so the side skirts actually are
gonna<00:01:56.100> take<00:01:56.310> take<00:01:57.680> part<00:01:58.680> in<00:01:58.799> the

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
gonna take take part in the

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.920 
gonna take take part in the
transformation<00:01:59.189> so<00:01:59.640> I<00:01:59.729> was<00:01:59.909> in<00:02:00.090> incorrect

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
transformation so I was in incorrect

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.240 
transformation so I was in incorrect
when<00:02:01.140> I<00:02:01.200> said<00:02:01.409> that<00:02:01.530> these<00:02:01.649> would<00:02:01.799> need<00:02:01.890> not<00:02:02.100> be

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
when I said that these would need not be

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.050 
when I said that these would need not be
used<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.759> was<00:02:02.909> only<00:02:03.060> in<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.799> Lambo<00:02:04.880> robot<00:02:05.880> that

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
used it was only in the Lambo robot that

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.880 
used it was only in the Lambo robot that
these<00:02:06.270> side<00:02:06.990> skirts<00:02:07.290> don't<00:02:07.469> get<00:02:07.560> used<00:02:07.680> but

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
these side skirts don't get used but

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.400 
these side skirts don't get used but
this<00:02:08.009> in<00:02:08.250> his<00:02:08.819> case<00:02:09.060> these<00:02:09.750> do<00:02:09.899> get<00:02:10.080> used<00:02:10.259> and

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
this in his case these do get used and

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.010 
this in his case these do get used and
they<00:02:10.470> plug<00:02:10.679> into<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:10.979> sides<00:02:11.160> here

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
they plug into the sides here

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:22.100 
they plug into the sides here
so<00:02:15.920> let's<00:02:18.590> plug<00:02:19.590> him<00:02:19.710> in<00:02:19.800> like<00:02:19.920> that<00:02:20.070> and<00:02:21.110> you

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
so let's plug him in like that and you

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.540 
so let's plug him in like that and you
can<00:02:22.200> see<00:02:22.350> that<00:02:22.530> they<00:02:22.710> have<00:02:22.740> light-piping

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
can see that they have light-piping

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.130 
can see that they have light-piping
there<00:02:24.350> so<00:02:25.350> plug<00:02:25.530> that<00:02:25.650> in<00:02:25.830> there<00:02:26.840> and<00:02:27.840> you've

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
there so plug that in there and you've

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.470 
there so plug that in there and you've
got<00:02:28.260> yourself<00:02:28.980> a<00:02:29.040> nice<00:02:29.190> little<00:02:29.400> twin<00:02:29.760> blaster

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
got yourself a nice little twin blaster

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:41.660 
got yourself a nice little twin blaster
there<00:02:32.330> let's<00:02:33.330> take<00:02:33.420> a<00:02:33.480> look<00:02:33.690> at<00:02:33.810> here<00:02:40.670> all

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
there let's take a look at here all

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.730 
there let's take a look at here all
right<00:02:41.850> so<00:02:43.160> this<00:02:44.300> whoops<00:02:45.300> this<00:02:45.750> is<00:02:45.810> a<00:02:46.260> solid

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
right so this whoops this is a solid

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.180 
right so this whoops this is a solid
piece<00:02:46.920> that<00:02:47.580> is<00:02:48.350> just<00:02:49.350> cast<00:02:49.560> in<00:02:49.710> the<00:02:49.800> plastic

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
piece that is just cast in the plastic

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.090 
piece that is just cast in the plastic
and<00:02:50.310> that<00:02:50.430> pigs<00:02:50.820> into<00:02:51.150> is<00:02:51.440> other<00:02:52.440> hand<00:02:52.740> very

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
and that pigs into is other hand very

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.610 
and that pigs into is other hand very
nicely<00:02:53.810> one<00:02:54.810> thing<00:02:54.960> I<00:02:55.020> noticed<00:02:55.290> about<00:02:55.320> this

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
nicely one thing I noticed about this

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.010 
nicely one thing I noticed about this
figure<00:02:56.580> in<00:02:56.820> particular<00:02:57.240> he's<00:02:57.600> got<00:02:57.780> really

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
figure in particular he's got really

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.990 
figure in particular he's got really
weak<00:02:58.200> knees<00:02:58.470> and<00:02:58.740> so<00:02:58.920> any<00:02:59.310> kind<00:02:59.430> of<00:02:59.550> fiddling

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
weak knees and so any kind of fiddling

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.420 
weak knees and so any kind of fiddling
around<00:03:00.060> I<00:03:00.240> deal<00:03:00.390> with<00:03:00.420> him<00:03:00.680> he'll<00:03:01.680> tend<00:03:02.370> to

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
around I deal with him he'll tend to

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.240 
around I deal with him he'll tend to
topple<00:03:02.790> over<00:03:02.910> so<00:03:03.240> got<00:03:03.570> to<00:03:03.600> pardon<00:03:03.900> that

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
topple over so got to pardon that

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:10.010 
topple over so got to pardon that
alright<00:03:05.250> so<00:03:06.710> as<00:03:07.710> in<00:03:08.310> most<00:03:09.210> of<00:03:09.450> the<00:03:09.540> robots<00:03:09.660> at

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
alright so as in most of the robots at

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.330 
alright so as in most of the robots at
least<00:03:10.170> the<00:03:10.260> one<00:03:10.380> I<00:03:10.470> at<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:10.680> ones<00:03:10.890> that<00:03:10.980> I<00:03:11.070> own

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
least the one I at the ones that I own

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:17.300 
least the one I at the ones that I own
and<00:03:12.120> have<00:03:12.420> seen<00:03:12.680> they<00:03:15.260> physically<00:03:16.260> are<00:03:16.560> rather

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
and have seen they physically are rather

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.120 
and have seen they physically are rather
visually<00:03:17.850> and<00:03:18.360> physically<00:03:18.780> these<00:03:19.560> arms<00:03:19.980> are

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
visually and physically these arms are

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.900 
visually and physically these arms are
really<00:03:20.280> the<00:03:20.550> weak<00:03:20.670> point<00:03:21.000> of<00:03:21.330> this<00:03:21.600> figure<00:03:22.410> and

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
really the weak point of this figure and

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.350 
really the weak point of this figure and
most<00:03:23.910> of<00:03:24.000> the<00:03:24.060> robots<00:03:24.209> as<00:03:24.540> well<00:03:24.830> it's<00:03:25.830> just<00:03:26.040> a

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
most of the robots as well it's just a

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.920 
most of the robots as well it's just a
as<00:03:27.360> you<00:03:27.510> can<00:03:27.630> take<00:03:27.930> a<00:03:27.990> look<00:03:28.080> at<00:03:28.200> the<00:03:28.260> side<00:03:28.440> here

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
as you can take a look at the side here

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:36.560 
as you can take a look at the side here
and<00:03:30.930> see<00:03:31.140> that<00:03:31.430> it's<00:03:32.430> just<00:03:32.670> uh<00:03:35.450> you<00:03:36.450> know

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
and see that it's just uh you know

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.699 
and see that it's just uh you know
probably<00:03:37.320> about<00:03:37.470> a<00:03:38.420> maybe<00:03:39.420> I<00:03:39.540> like<00:03:39.930> a<00:03:39.959> quarter

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
probably about a maybe I like a quarter

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.840 
probably about a maybe I like a quarter
inch<00:03:40.890> of<00:03:41.190> a<00:03:41.550> thick<00:03:42.590> plastic<00:03:43.590> there<00:03:43.980> and<00:03:44.370> you

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
inch of a thick plastic there and you

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.900 
inch of a thick plastic there and you
know<00:03:44.940> he's<00:03:45.060> got<00:03:45.180> these<00:03:45.330> decent<00:03:46.760> forearms<00:03:47.760> here

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
know he's got these decent forearms here

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.630 
know he's got these decent forearms here
but<00:03:48.180> and<00:03:48.390> this<00:03:49.050> is<00:03:49.200> on<00:03:49.350> a<00:03:49.380> ball-joint<00:03:49.620> here<00:03:50.040> you

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
but and this is on a ball-joint here you

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.790 
but and this is on a ball-joint here you
can<00:03:50.760> see<00:03:50.910> how<00:03:51.060> it<00:03:51.150> kind<00:03:51.330> of<00:03:51.410> groups<00:03:52.410> there<00:03:52.620> so

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
can see how it kind of groups there so

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.690 
can see how it kind of groups there so
that's<00:03:52.920> not<00:03:53.040> so<00:03:53.190> good<00:03:53.370> but<00:03:54.180> uh<00:03:54.209> you<00:03:54.750> know<00:03:54.870> I<00:03:55.700> can

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
that's not so good but uh you know I can

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.199 
that's not so good but uh you know I can
I<00:03:56.940> can<00:03:57.090> forgive<00:03:57.330> a<00:03:57.390> lot<00:03:57.630> because<00:03:57.930> this<00:03:58.320> is<00:03:58.470> a

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
I can forgive a lot because this is a

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:02.420 
I can forgive a lot because this is a
sheer<00:04:00.209> scale<00:04:00.810> this<00:04:01.110> guy<00:04:01.260> plus<00:04:02.010> you<00:04:02.160> know<00:04:02.250> he's

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
sheer scale this guy plus you know he's

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.910 
sheer scale this guy plus you know he's
based<00:04:02.610> on<00:04:02.790> a<00:04:02.820> car<00:04:03.300> that<00:04:03.480> I<00:04:03.510> really<00:04:03.810> really<00:04:04.740> like

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
based on a car that I really really like

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.380 
based on a car that I really really like
the<00:04:05.100> Toyota<00:04:05.310> Supra<00:04:07.400> so<00:04:08.400> I<00:04:08.430> can<00:04:08.970> overlook<00:04:09.180> that

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
the Toyota Supra so I can overlook that

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.960 
the Toyota Supra so I can overlook that
so<00:04:09.570> that's<00:04:09.810> kind<00:04:10.020> of<00:04:10.050> thing<00:04:10.670> let's<00:04:11.670> go<00:04:11.850> ahead

let's go ahead and just take these

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.610 
let's go ahead and just take these
weapons<00:04:20.700> out<00:04:20.820> for<00:04:21.000> now<00:04:21.120> it<00:04:21.780> kind<00:04:22.260> of<00:04:22.290> blocking

like a 360 rotation around this guy and

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:08.909 
like a 360 rotation around this guy and
see<00:05:00.110> what<00:05:00.229> it<00:05:00.320> looks<00:05:00.470> like

hauled out because what happens is the

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.510 
hauled out because what happens is the
the<00:05:29.080> robot<00:05:30.080> arm<00:05:30.200> to<00:05:30.290> get<00:05:30.470> stored<00:05:30.680> in<00:05:30.860> in<00:05:31.100> these

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520

of cable hanging off of him and actually
this<00:05:44.450> needs<00:05:44.660> to<00:05:44.720> be<00:05:44.780> up<00:05:44.960> this<00:05:45.140> keeps<00:05:45.380> popping

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:45.710

knees<00:06:06.530> these<00:06:07.780> these<00:06:08.780> are<00:06:08.990> loose<00:06:09.260> I<00:06:09.560> suppose<00:06:09.950> I

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:10.100 
knees these these are loose I suppose I

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.610 
knees these these are loose I suppose I
can<00:06:10.250> what<00:06:10.550> I<00:06:10.580> might<00:06:11.030> try<00:06:11.180> to<00:06:11.210> do<00:06:11.440> these<00:06:12.440> are

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:12.620 
can what I might try to do these are

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.140 
can what I might try to do these are
Phillips<00:06:13.070> head<00:06:13.220> screws<00:06:13.790> here<00:06:13.850> I<00:06:13.940> might<00:06:14.030> try

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:14.150 
Phillips head screws here I might try

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.330 
Phillips head screws here I might try
this<00:06:14.330> tighten<00:06:14.750> these<00:06:14.810> up<00:06:14.870> to<00:06:15.230> the<00:06:15.320> so<00:06:16.220> that

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:16.340 
this tighten these up to the so that

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.130 
this tighten these up to the so that
they're<00:06:16.670> stiffer<00:06:17.090> I<00:06:17.120> don't<00:06:17.360> know<00:06:17.450> tightening

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:18.140 
they're stiffer I don't know tightening

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.020 
they're stiffer I don't know tightening
too<00:06:18.260> tight<00:06:18.440> otherwise<00:06:18.560> I'll<00:06:18.920> have<00:06:19.670> problems

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:20.030 
too tight otherwise I'll have problems

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:23.530 
too tight otherwise I'll have problems
transforming<00:06:20.510> back<00:06:20.690> into<00:06:21.020> his<00:06:22.120> his<00:06:23.120> car<00:06:23.360> mode

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:23.540 
transforming back into his his car mode

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:25.030 
transforming back into his his car mode
but<00:06:23.720> I<00:06:23.750> might<00:06:24.050> try<00:06:24.230> that<00:06:24.260> see<00:06:24.620> if<00:06:24.680> that<00:06:24.830> works

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:25.040 
but I might try that see if that works

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.790 
but I might try that see if that works
because<00:06:25.900> he's<00:06:26.900> hard<00:06:27.110> to<00:06:27.230> get<00:06:27.350> balance

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:27.800 
because he's hard to get balance

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.000 
because he's hard to get balance
correctly<00:06:28.430> and<00:06:28.720> not<00:06:29.720> only<00:06:29.840> that<00:06:29.960> but<00:06:30.230> the<00:06:30.830> fact

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:31.010 
correctly and not only that but the fact

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:33.160 
correctly and not only that but the fact
that<00:06:31.040> there's<00:06:31.220> knees<00:06:31.370> are<00:06:31.490> loose<00:06:31.900> is<00:06:32.900> kind<00:06:33.110> of

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:33.170 
that there's knees are loose is kind of

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:37.120 
that there's knees are loose is kind of
a<00:06:33.260> pain<00:06:33.760> so<00:06:35.020> as<00:06:36.020> far<00:06:36.230> as<00:06:36.290> the<00:06:36.560> what<00:06:36.890> I<00:06:36.920> paid<00:06:37.100> for

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:37.130 
a pain so as far as the what I paid for

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.310 
a pain so as far as the what I paid for
this<00:06:37.310> guy<00:06:37.490> I<00:06:37.700> think<00:06:37.880> I<00:06:37.970> bought<00:06:38.180> it<00:06:38.360> on<00:06:38.570> I<00:06:38.630> won

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:39.320 
this guy I think I bought it on I won

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:40.810 
this guy I think I bought it on I won
him<00:06:39.410> off<00:06:39.500> of<00:06:39.530> ebay<00:06:39.740> and<00:06:39.920> I<00:06:40.160> think<00:06:40.370> that<00:06:40.760> his

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:40.820 
him off of ebay and I think that his

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:44.650 
him off of ebay and I think that his
cost<00:06:41.120> was<00:06:41.480> around<00:06:42.580> I'd<00:06:43.580> say<00:06:43.790> 30<00:06:44.120> to<00:06:44.210> 40<00:06:44.480> bucks

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:44.660 
cost was around I'd say 30 to 40 bucks

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:48.990 
cost was around I'd say 30 to 40 bucks
and<00:06:45.050> then<00:06:45.440> you<00:06:45.620> throw<00:06:45.860> in<00:06:45.920> shipping<00:06:46.280> also

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:49.000 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.310 

overall<00:06:50.000> he's<00:06:50.420> a<00:06:50.450> he's<00:06:50.780> a<00:06:50.840> really<00:06:51.050> nice<00:06:51.140> figure

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:51.320 
overall he's a he's a really nice figure

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:56.320 
overall he's a he's a really nice figure
I<00:06:51.590> have<00:06:52.400> to<00:06:52.490> say<00:06:52.640> though<00:06:52.970> that<00:06:53.000> the<00:06:55.090> so<00:06:56.090> far<00:06:56.300> I

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:56.330 
I have to say though that the so far I

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.980 
I have to say though that the so far I
like<00:06:56.540> the<00:06:56.720> the<00:06:57.320> one<00:06:57.470> T<00:06:57.650> 1/18<00:06:58.370> scale<00:06:58.490> a<00:06:59.090> lambo

00:06:59.980 --> 00:06:59.990
