the<00:01:46.610> ADI<00:01:48.619> swordsmen<00:01:49.619> I<00:01:49.770> guess<00:01:49.979> with<00:01:50.490> the

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
the ADI swordsmen I guess with the

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:54.289 
the ADI swordsmen I guess with the
source<00:01:52.229> how<00:01:52.920> they're<00:01:53.490> calling<00:01:53.850> that<00:01:54.030> history

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
source how they're calling that history

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.080 
source how they're calling that history
expert<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:55.009> these<00:01:56.009> are<00:01:56.280> that<00:01:56.610> this<00:01:56.790> is<00:01:56.969> the

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
expert and these are that this is the

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.639 
expert and these are that this is the
green<00:01:57.390> platoon<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.860> blue<00:01:59.490> platoon<00:01:59.670> the<00:02:00.649> red

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
green platoon the blue platoon the red

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.690 
green platoon the blue platoon the red
platoon<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:03.409> German<00:02:04.409> platoon<00:02:04.950> these<00:02:05.430> are

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
platoon and the German platoon these are

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.249 
platoon and the German platoon these are
actually<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.180> foreign<00:02:06.930> so

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
actually a foreign so

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.470 
actually a foreign so
yeah<00:02:09.259> so<00:02:09.530> these<00:02:09.650> are<00:02:09.890> not<00:02:10.310> with<00:02:10.970> the<00:02:11.150> Roman

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
yeah so these are not with the Roman

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.960 
yeah so these are not with the Roman
army<00:02:11.720> but<00:02:12.020> I<00:02:12.380> just<00:02:12.800> thought<00:02:12.980> I'm<00:02:13.430> pretty<00:02:13.790> good

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
army but I just thought I'm pretty good

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.110 
army but I just thought I'm pretty good
to<00:02:14.270> add<00:02:14.630> them<00:02:15.290> in<00:02:15.440> since<00:02:15.920> technically<00:02:16.760> during

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
to add them in since technically during

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.190 
to add them in since technically during
Constantine's<00:02:17.540> rule<00:02:18.110> he<00:02:18.770> did<00:02:19.010> a<00:02:19.780> put<00:02:20.780> soldiers

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
Constantine's rule he did a put soldiers

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.690 
Constantine's rule he did a put soldiers
in<00:02:21.410> the<00:02:21.590> Roman<00:02:22.100> army

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
in the Roman army

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.760 
in the Roman army
so<00:02:22.910> I'm<00:02:23.300> concluding<00:02:23.720> here<00:02:24.230> right<00:02:24.440> now<00:02:24.560> at

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770
