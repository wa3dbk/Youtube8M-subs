00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:29.159 
all the time especially since the

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:31.159 
all the time especially since the
zombies<00:03:29.519> are<00:03:29.639> AF<00:03:30.180> cable<00:03:30.689> since<00:03:30.989> they're

zombies are AF cable since they're

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:33.979

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:38.599 
altar to recharge your prayer is a good
idea<00:03:37.409> because<00:03:37.620> when<00:03:37.979> you<00:03:38.069> come<00:03:38.250> back<00:03:38.370> down

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
idea because when you come back down

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:41.890 
idea because when you come back down
they<00:03:38.790> will<00:03:39.030> be<00:03:39.209> aggressive<00:03:40.019> once<00:03:40.799> again

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900

they will be aggressive once again

incredibly cheap and very effective to
bring<00:05:15.419> here<00:05:15.690> so<00:05:15.900> definitely<00:05:16.380> I<00:05:16.680> would

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:17.099 
bring here so definitely I would

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:18.769 
bring here so definitely I would

00:05:18.769 --> 00:05:18.779 
recommend just bringing pretty much full

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:21.170 
recommend just bringing pretty much full

whatever offensive potions you want and

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:26.420 
whatever offensive potions you want and
that'll<00:05:24.089> be<00:05:24.419> a<00:05:24.630> great<00:05:25.229> way<00:05:25.380> to<00:05:25.440> do<00:05:25.710> it<00:05:25.860> I'll

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
that'll be a great way to do it I'll

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.310 
that'll be a great way to do it I'll
bring<00:05:26.729> along<00:05:26.969> a<00:05:27.029> bone<00:05:27.330> crusher<00:05:27.839> and<00:05:28.020> or

herbicide<00:05:28.800> also<00:05:29.520> works<00:05:29.729> great<00:05:29.849> since<00:05:30.330> they

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:30.449 
herbicide also works great since they

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:33.019 
herbicide also works great since they
drop<00:05:30.690> lots<00:05:30.930> of<00:05:31.080> herbs<00:05:31.199> and<00:05:31.380> lots<00:05:31.589> of<00:05:31.740> bones<00:05:32.029> and

drop lots of herbs and lots of bones and

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:35.300 
drop lots of herbs and lots of bones and
they're<00:05:33.810> not<00:05:33.900> really<00:05:34.169> worth<00:05:34.440> learning<00:05:34.710> so<00:05:35.250> you

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
they're not really worth learning so you

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:36.950 
they're not really worth learning so you
might<00:05:35.550> as<00:05:35.639> well<00:05:35.789> get<00:05:35.909> some<00:05:36.150> extra<00:05:36.449> experience

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
might as well get some extra experience

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.200 
might as well get some extra experience
out<00:05:37.320> of<00:05:37.349> that<00:05:37.589> if<00:05:37.830> you<00:05:38.070> have<00:05:38.310> it<00:05:38.460> if<00:05:38.880> you<00:05:39.029> don't

make upwards of 150 k an hour if you

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.129 
make upwards of 150 k an hour if you
consider<00:05:56.940> if<00:05:57.150> your<00:05:57.330> lower<00:05:57.539> level<00:05:57.810> player<00:05:57.839> you

00:05:58.129 --> 00:05:58.139 
consider if your lower level player you

00:05:58.139 --> 00:05:59.990 
consider if your lower level player you
consider<00:05:58.469> that<00:05:58.589> to<00:05:58.650> be<00:05:58.740> a<00:05:58.889> lot<00:05:59.159> that<00:05:59.550> is<00:05:59.669> by<00:05:59.789> all

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 
consider that to be a lot that is by all

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.149 
consider that to be a lot that is by all
means<00:06:00.389> go<00:06:00.659> ahead<00:06:00.690> and<00:06:01.050> do<00:06:01.199> it<00:06:01.349> but<00:06:01.889> if<00:06:01.919> your

00:06:02.149 --> 00:06:02.159 
means go ahead and do it but if your

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:05.180 
means go ahead and do it but if your
high<00:06:02.310> level<00:06:02.639> player<00:06:03.440> realize<00:06:04.440> that<00:06:04.800> the

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:05.190 
high level player realize that the

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.879 
high level player realize that the
decision<00:06:05.729> to<00:06:05.940> loot<00:06:06.240> the<00:06:06.270> drops<00:06:07.020> well

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:07.889 
decision to loot the drops well

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:10.700 
decision to loot the drops well
inversely<00:06:08.610> affect<00:06:09.089> your<00:06:09.570> experience<00:06:10.469> gained

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:10.710 
inversely affect your experience gained

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:13.129 
inversely affect your experience gained
so<00:06:11.039> if<00:06:11.190> you're<00:06:11.339> making<00:06:11.820> money<00:06:12.060> or<00:06:12.419> be<00:06:12.570> gaining

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:13.139 
so if you're making money or be gaining

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:15.560 
so if you're making money or be gaining
less<00:06:13.440> experience<00:06:14.070> also<00:06:14.909> you'll<00:06:15.120> be<00:06:15.240> taking

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:15.570 
less experience also you'll be taking

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:19.550 
less experience also you'll be taking
away<00:06:15.719> from<00:06:15.930> the<00:06:16.050> AFK<00:06:16.289> ability<00:06:16.979> of<00:06:17.159> this<00:06:18.529> was<00:06:19.529> a

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:19.560 
away from the AFK ability of this was a

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.350 
away from the AFK ability of this was a
task<00:06:19.979> you<00:06:20.310> could<00:06:20.520> do<00:06:20.610> a<00:06:20.639> little<00:06:20.820> Slayer<00:06:21.029> task

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 
task you could do a little Slayer task

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.810 
task you could do a little Slayer task
but<00:06:21.719> then<00:06:22.469> you<00:06:22.560> can<00:06:22.770> use<00:06:22.889> the<00:06:23.039> boar<00:06:23.190> armor<00:06:23.550> what

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:23.820 
but then you can use the boar armor what

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.700 
but then you can use the boar armor what
is<00:06:23.969> then<00:06:24.360> the<00:06:24.449> whole<00:06:24.599> point<00:06:24.839> is<00:06:25.050> that<00:06:25.080> doesn't

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:25.710 
is then the whole point is that doesn't

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:29.270 
is then the whole point is that doesn't
require<00:06:25.919> Slayer<00:06:26.339> to<00:06:26.639> be<00:06:26.820> very<00:06:27.539> effective<00:06:28.280> so

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:29.280 
require Slayer to be very effective so

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.990 
require Slayer to be very effective so
