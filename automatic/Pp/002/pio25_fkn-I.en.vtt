00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:22.500
 Many ... lots ... 52 ... I think there are 52 different types of evidence. 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.760
 We often say we have all kinds of evidence. 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:33.800
 Some evidence will be easy to understand for everyone, while others are quite complex and indirect. 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.920
 But ... put them together ... 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.780
 ... those evidence show a convincing conclusion that this crime is happening. 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:52.140
 We often talk about phone calls, in which we arrange for callers to be fluent in Chinese. 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:01:02.670
 They will call hospitals throughout China ... and say on the phone that they are looking for transplants from Falun Gong practitioners. 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:15.170
 They will ask to speak directly to the doctor, and often they can see the doctor on the phone on the weekend. It was 2006 and these doctors would say, "Yes, we have this type through the court system or the police." 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:23.180
 And then we ... Sorry I'm looking for a map ... then we re-mark the hospitals that answer. 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.740
 We hire independent translators to ensure accurate translation. 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.120
 All are in this book, and we still keep the audio tapes. 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.340
 And .... this is ... 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:45.500
 People can see dots, and wherever there are dots, it is a hospital or detention center ... 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:54.200
 ... where we recorded a conversation about the availability of these Falun Gong practitioners for organ harvesting. 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:04.920
 And it is hard to imagine how foolish the Chinese government is: To refute our accusations, they go to a recording doctor ... apparently at this hospital. 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.960
 The Phoenix Station recorded the interview. And they let him say: 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:16.400
 Yes, I got a phone call that day, they asked this, and I talked to them. 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.640
 But I don't say this and that, I say that, denying my own words. 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.920
 In other words... 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.180
 Even if it is Chinese, we can get his voice. 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.770
 Do they think we can turn it into another story? 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:43.200
 But I guess they think ... everyone is so stupid that believing that we edited the conversation. 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:50.560
 so i want to say that the level of evidence to their uncle and it is just too meaningless and it's too stupid that ... that ... we think ... 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:57.340
 We believe that everyone who understands the right will never doubt the weight of all these evidence. 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:07.880
 Of course people will not be able to see the footage proving this crime. We need to understand that they are killing people in the operating room, and no one there will come back to this incident. 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:16.930
 There are some photos that have been taken, and it is very difficult we have. There are people who cannot believe unless they can see the footage of this crime. 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.600
 They asked to watch the movie. And we insist that we cannot get them. 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.700
 The doctor will not film his crime. 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.280
 And the victims are dead. 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:39.580
 Its circumstances are so special. I look forward to getting some movies about these surgeries, but until now, we haven't had them. 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.200
 There are some special events that have happened. 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:58.500
 I had some free time this morning and it seems that someone sent to Epoch Times to record a recording of a conversation of Bo Xilai at a Kempinski hotel, which is Berlin. 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:07.340
 Someone has recorded this call. This is a call from a person at the Chinese embassy. 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:16.260
 And everything has been mentioned. Which room are you in? And then the question is: Who ordered him to have organ harvesting from Falun Gong? 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.560
 And then Silver said very clearly that it was President Jiang Zemin. 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.580
 The story lasts longer ... 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.960
 But this is a good proof ... 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.900
 because everyone knows that Jiang Zemin is the culprit of the persecution. 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:43.120
 Now we have Bo Xilai to acknowledge this. It could be said that he was the leader of the persecution of Falun Gong in Dalian and Liaoning. 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:49.580
 And then Vuong Lap Quan, director of the police, who had to flee at the US consulate. 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.800
 We found some of his words. 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:05:04.570
 He once received a reward for "thousands" of surgeries that test organ harvesting from human bodies. 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:11.480
 He said that ... "This shook people's hearts." How disgusting! 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:17.280
 This ... this is not something people can say. But he said. 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:29.100
 So if viewers can be open and willing to consider these evidence, they will understand that this crime has actually happened, still happening, and it needs to be terminated. 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.340
 And we will continue to condemn it to the very end.
