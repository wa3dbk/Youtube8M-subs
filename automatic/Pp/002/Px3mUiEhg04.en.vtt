 that the body because I am on high and everything 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.060
 some of the style is short and does not need 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.869
 lengthen them and so this bay also 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.060
 for those who need to shorten a 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.480
 style that is lower 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.989
 I found this tape that you 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.149

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.980

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.540
 teaching here is the dress we go 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.239
 be doing the bahia 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.610
 the tape is very wide so what I go 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.660
 I'll cut the ribbon 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.640
 china can bahia is narrow and 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:55.649
 dress as soon as I need 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:57.420
 that it is for you that wants to do the 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.609

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.309

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:07.740
 tape what do we have to do to 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:09.299
 measure is right because they work 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.409
 with this pie, otherwise you'll ruin the 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.810
 your dress 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.330
 you measure if you need the help of 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.009
 a pin you put the fillet to have 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.040
 sure that the size of the output 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.920
 right 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.990
 Who do you measure well and then what? 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.750
 You measure you'll get the iron fine. 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.579
 hot 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.070
 care not with tissue according to 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:35.960
 the fabric you are wearing and you will 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:40.909
 and if this neighborhood 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.909
 you pass by, the bay goes by 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.450

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:00.630
 be careful not to iron 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.870
 take on this white ribbon because iron 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:07.550
 Can not pick up the white ribbon. 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:07.550
 he has to pick up only the fabric 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:15.780
 Can you make noise invested in chaos? 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.000

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.670
 when you wash you can stay 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:26.430
 Carefree because it does not let you go. 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:29.930
 washing can happen to me that 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:40.890

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:41.910
