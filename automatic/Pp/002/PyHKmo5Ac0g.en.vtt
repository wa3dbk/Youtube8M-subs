something that's not really in tune with

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.710 
something that's not really in tune with
because<00:01:26.610> what<00:01:26.850> they're<00:01:27.000> about<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.300> who<00:01:27.600> they

on and what's what's following the

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.410 
on and what's what's following the
trends<00:01:33.479> has<00:01:33.869> been<00:01:34.740> very<00:01:34.979> helpful<00:01:35.190> for<00:01:35.670> us<00:01:36.000> and

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
trends has been very helpful for us and

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.900 
trends has been very helpful for us and
you<00:01:37.140> know<00:01:37.229> just<00:01:37.259> just<00:01:37.920> playing<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.520> going<00:01:38.759> out

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:38.910 
you know just just playing and going out

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.990 
you know just just playing and going out
and<00:01:39.450> actually<00:01:40.050> playing<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.950> think<00:01:41.610> is<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:41.759> big

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
and actually playing I think is a big

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.170 
and actually playing I think is a big
part<00:01:42.240> of<00:01:42.410> sticking<00:01:43.410> around<00:01:43.530> I<00:01:43.950> say<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.850> key<00:01:45.030> to

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
part of sticking around I say the key to

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.880 
part of sticking around I say the key to
have<00:01:45.360> in<00:01:45.570> longevity<00:01:45.780> as<00:01:46.259> artists<00:01:46.740> is

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
have in longevity as artists is

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.090 
have in longevity as artists is
definitely<00:01:47.399> always<00:01:47.820> staying<00:01:48.570> creative<00:01:49.100> being

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
definitely always staying creative being

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.950 
definitely always staying creative being
able<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.490> switch<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:51.000> up<00:01:51.149> but<00:01:51.509> still<00:01:51.720> being

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
able to switch it up but still being

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.740 
able to switch it up but still being
consistent<00:01:52.729> which<00:01:53.729> sounds<00:01:54.060> kind<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.330> tricky

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
consistent which sounds kind of tricky

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.840 
consistent which sounds kind of tricky
but<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.200> game<00:01:55.380> is<00:01:55.560> tricky<00:01:55.920> so<00:01:56.250> you<00:01:56.310> got<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.759> be

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
but the game is tricky so you got to be

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.249 
but the game is tricky so you got to be
able<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:57.149> do<00:01:57.270> all<00:01:57.420> those<00:01:57.570> things<00:01:57.630> at<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.080> same

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
able to do all those things at the same

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.169 
able to do all those things at the same
time<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:59.039> know<00:01:59.160> you<00:01:59.220> look<00:01:59.490> at<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.759> people<00:02:00.060> who

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.660 
I think the key to longevity having a
long<00:03:10.730> career<00:03:10.940> is<00:03:11.180> on<00:03:11.210> I<00:03:11.870> think<00:03:12.620> pace<00:03:12.950> not

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
long career is on I think pace not

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.750 
long career is on I think pace not
