00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
show you what we can do with this we can

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.630 
show you what we can do with this we can
do<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.660> ton<00:00:48.989> of<00:00:49.020> different<00:00:49.379> things<00:00:49.620> on<00:00:49.890> as<00:00:50.430> many

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
do a ton of different things on as many

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.580 
do a ton of different things on as many
as<00:00:50.760> we<00:00:50.940> want<00:00:51.210> for<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.480> most<00:00:51.690> part<00:00:51.930> so<00:00:52.559> let's

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
as we want for the most part so let's

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.900 
as we want for the most part so let's
type<00:00:53.219> NP<00:00:54.210> so<00:00:55.110> maybe<00:00:55.379> we<00:00:55.590> type<00:00:55.800> NP<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.280> lot<00:00:56.579> in<00:00:56.789> our

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
type NP so maybe we type NP a lot in our

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.520 
type NP so maybe we type NP a lot in our
documents<00:00:57.510> or<00:00:57.690> we<00:00:57.840> want<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.050> use<00:00:58.170> shorthand

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
documents or we want to use shorthand

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.430 
documents or we want to use shorthand
and<00:00:58.920> we<00:00:59.910> want<00:01:00.120> it<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.329> be<00:01:00.449> replaced<00:01:00.960> with<00:01:01.230> no

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
and we want it to be replaced with no

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.490 
and we want it to be replaced with no
problem<00:01:02.090> click<00:01:03.090> off<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.539> that<00:01:03.719> now<00:01:03.750> it's<00:01:04.170> saved

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
problem click off of that now it's saved

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.440 
problem click off of that now it's saved
so<00:01:05.129> if<00:01:05.220> we<00:01:05.309> open<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.610> text<00:01:05.970> document

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
so if we open a text document

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.039 
so if we open a text document
I'll<00:01:06.540> open<00:01:06.659> TextEdit<00:01:08.390> here<00:01:09.390> we<00:01:09.510> have<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.659> text

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
I'll open TextEdit here we have a text

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.649 
I'll open TextEdit here we have a text
document<00:01:10.200> now<00:01:11.159> normally<00:01:11.640> we<00:01:11.760> could<00:01:11.880> type<00:01:12.119> NP

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
document now normally we could type NP

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.570 
document now normally we could type NP
and<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:12.960> wouldn't<00:01:13.170> do<00:01:13.260> anything<00:01:13.500> we<00:01:13.860> type<00:01:14.070> NP

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
and it wouldn't do anything we type NP

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.330 
and it wouldn't do anything we type NP
hit<00:01:15.030> space<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:16.409> autocorrects<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.220> no

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
hit space and it autocorrects to no

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.960 
hit space and it autocorrects to no
problem

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
problem

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.179 
problem
that<00:01:18.600> will<00:01:18.750> work<00:01:18.930> over<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.470> over<00:01:19.590> as<00:01:19.830> long<00:01:19.979> as

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
that will work over and over as long as

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.359 
that will work over and over as long as
we<00:01:20.310> have<00:01:20.520> this<00:01:20.759> checked<00:01:21.560> we<00:01:22.560> can<00:01:22.770> do<00:01:22.950> many

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
we have this checked we can do many

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.859 
we have this checked we can do many
different<00:01:23.490> things<00:01:23.909> with<00:01:24.119> it<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.360> can<00:01:24.540> see<00:01:24.750> if

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
different things with it you can see if

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.330 
different things with it you can see if
I<00:01:25.020> type<00:01:25.259> this<00:01:25.530> it'll<00:01:25.830> do<00:01:25.950> different<00:01:26.310> things

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
I type this it'll do different things

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.069 
I type this it'll do different things
like<00:01:26.700> copyright<00:01:27.450> but<00:01:28.110> maybe<00:01:28.320> we<00:01:28.530> do<00:01:28.740> NP<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:30.390> M

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
like copyright but maybe we do NP and M

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:38.230 
like copyright but maybe we do NP and M
for<00:01:31.439> nevermind

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.260 

or<00:01:38.630> maybe<00:01:39.560> we<00:01:39.799> want<00:01:40.250> to<00:01:40.369> use<00:01:40.670> something<00:01:40.940> we

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
or maybe we want to use something we

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.800 
or maybe we want to use something we
misspell<00:01:42.229> often<00:01:42.770> something<00:01:43.100> complicated<00:01:44.090> so

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
misspell often something complicated so

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:50.050 
misspell often something complicated so
you<00:01:44.840> can<00:01:45.049> see<00:01:45.320> an<00:01:45.530> M<00:01:45.830> never<00:01:46.670> mind<00:01:48.850> there's<00:01:49.850> a

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
you can see an M never mind there's a

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.370 
you can see an M never mind there's a
lot<00:01:50.300> of<00:01:50.420> different<00:01:50.659> things<00:01:50.750> we<00:01:50.930> could<00:01:51.080> do<00:01:51.229> with

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
lot of different things we could do with

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.710 
lot of different things we could do with
this<00:01:51.500> you<00:01:51.740> could<00:01:51.890> go<00:01:51.920> on<00:01:52.190> and<00:01:52.369> on<00:01:52.460> and<00:01:52.670> on

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
this you could go on and on and on

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.719 
this you could go on and on and on
we<00:01:54.020> could<00:01:54.229> make<00:01:54.470> anytime<00:01:55.159> we<00:01:55.340> say<00:01:55.550> hello<00:01:57.729> we

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
we could make anytime we say hello we

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.270 
we could make anytime we say hello we
could<00:01:58.909> make<00:01:59.270> it<00:01:59.420> say<00:01:59.600> goodbye<00:02:00.020> so<00:02:00.710> this<00:02:00.860> might

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
could make it say goodbye so this might

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.219 
could make it say goodbye so this might
be<00:02:01.430> a<00:02:01.460> fun<00:02:01.700> way<00:02:01.850> to<00:02:01.909> mess<00:02:02.420> around<00:02:02.570> with<00:02:02.899> someone

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
be a fun way to mess around with someone

be a fun way to mess around with someone
as<00:02:03.320> well<00:02:04.690> and<00:02:05.690> it'll<00:02:06.080> say<00:02:06.229> goodbye<00:02:06.560> so<00:02:06.890> we

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
as well and it'll say goodbye so we

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:08.800 
as well and it'll say goodbye so we
could<00:02:07.580> do<00:02:07.700> a<00:02:07.729> lot<00:02:07.940> of<00:02:08.119> different<00:02:08.420> things<00:02:08.630> with

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
that but it's pretty simple and we could

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.430 
that but it's pretty simple and we could
enter<00:02:10.580> those<00:02:10.729> automatically<00:02:11.720> now<00:02:11.870> a<00:02:12.080> lot<00:02:12.320> of

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
enter those automatically now a lot of

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.290 
enter those automatically now a lot of
