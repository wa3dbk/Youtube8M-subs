00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629 
a big drain on system resources so if

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:02.179

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:23.879 
very advanced security now I will say

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:25.189 
very advanced security now I will say
that<00:03:24.030> TrueCrypt<00:03:24.419> is<00:03:24.599> not<00:03:24.780> the<00:03:24.900> easiest

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:25.199 
that TrueCrypt is not the easiest

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:26.809 
that TrueCrypt is not the easiest
program<00:03:25.590> to<00:03:25.739> use<00:03:25.889> it<00:03:26.040> can<00:03:26.159> get<00:03:26.340> a<00:03:26.370> little<00:03:26.699> bit

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
program to use it can get a little bit

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:28.610 
program to use it can get a little bit
confusing<00:03:27.239> there's<00:03:27.540> a<00:03:27.629> lot<00:03:27.780> of<00:03:27.930> mounting<00:03:28.379> and

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
confusing there's a lot of mounting and

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.110 
confusing there's a lot of mounting and
selecting<00:03:29.250> your<00:03:29.340> files<00:03:29.579> and<00:03:29.790> making<00:03:29.939> sure

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
selecting your files and making sure

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.670 
selecting your files and making sure
everything<00:03:30.479> works<00:03:30.720> but<00:03:31.199> overall<00:03:31.439> if<00:03:31.590> you're

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
everything works but overall if you're

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.170 
everything works but overall if you're
looking<00:03:31.739> for<00:03:32.099> something<00:03:32.310> to<00:03:32.519> keep<00:03:32.729> your<00:03:32.909> file

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
looking for something to keep your file

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.509 
looking for something to keep your file
secure<00:03:33.750> and<00:03:34.470> when<00:03:34.709> I<00:03:34.769> say<00:03:34.889> secure<00:03:35.159> I<00:03:35.220> mean<00:03:35.370> very

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
secure and when I say secure I mean very

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.460 
secure and when I say secure I mean very
very<00:03:35.790> secure<00:03:36.150> I<00:03:36.359> highly<00:03:36.810> recommend<00:03:37.139> taking<00:03:37.290> a

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
very secure I highly recommend taking a

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:38.240 
very secure I highly recommend taking a
look<00:03:37.590> at<00:03:37.680> TrueCrypt

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
look at TrueCrypt

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.670 
look at TrueCrypt
so<00:03:38.729> there<00:03:38.879> you<00:03:38.970> go<00:03:39.090> my<00:03:39.359> top<00:03:39.629> five<00:03:39.900> free<00:03:40.290> Windows

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
so there you go my top five free Windows

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.379 
so there you go my top five free Windows
applications<00:03:41.370> that<00:03:41.519> really<00:03:41.669> everyone<00:03:42.209> should

manager<00:04:00.509> now<00:04:00.900> like<00:04:01.139> I<00:04:01.229> said<00:04:01.290> it's<00:04:01.500> a<00:04:01.530> very<00:04:01.769> very

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:01.979 
manager now like I said it's a very very

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:03.259 
manager now like I said it's a very very
simple<00:04:02.099> thing<00:04:02.430> there's<00:04:02.609> really<00:04:02.729> not<00:04:03.000> a<00:04:03.060> whole

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
simple thing there's really not a whole

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:04.280 
simple thing there's really not a whole
lot<00:04:03.479> to<00:04:03.509> do<00:04:03.840> about<00:04:04.079> it

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
lot to do about it

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.069 
lot to do about it
however<00:04:04.979> it's<00:04:05.099> definitely<00:04:05.459> very<00:04:05.549> useful

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:06.079 
however it's definitely very useful

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:08.749 
however it's definitely very useful
unfortunately<00:04:07.079> it<00:04:07.229> is<00:04:07.439> only<00:04:07.680> Windows<00:04:08.129> 7<00:04:08.519> so

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:08.759 
unfortunately it is only Windows 7 so

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:11.689 
unfortunately it is only Windows 7 so
unlike<00:04:09.389> the<00:04:09.419> other<00:04:09.629> five<00:04:09.959> this<00:04:10.949> is<00:04:11.129> only<00:04:11.340> for

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:11.699 
unlike the other five this is only for

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:13.490 
unlike the other five this is only for
people<00:04:11.970> who<00:04:12.120> have<00:04:12.239> Windows<00:04:12.689> 7<00:04:12.840> but<00:04:13.139> if<00:04:13.259> you<00:04:13.379> do

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
people who have Windows 7 but if you do

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
in any of the applications I showed

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.129 
in any of the applications I showed
definitely<00:04:21.120> be<00:04:21.209> sure<00:04:21.329> to<00:04:21.449> take<00:04:21.630> a<00:04:21.659> look<00:04:21.750> in<00:04:21.959> the
