00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
so I don't know should we go take a look

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.390 
so I don't know should we go take a look
and<00:01:58.010> see<00:01:58.070> what's<00:01:58.310> in<00:01:58.400> the<00:01:58.490> center<00:02:00.400> that's

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400 
and see what's in the center that's

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.770 
and see what's in the center that's
pretty<00:02:01.520> close<00:02:01.760> to<00:02:01.910> the<00:02:01.940> center<00:02:02.240> huh<00:02:02.360> yeah<00:02:02.630> it

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780

pretty close to the center huh yeah it
was<00:02:02.960> pretty<00:02:03.020> good<00:02:03.260> I<00:02:06.730> mean<00:02:07.730> it<00:02:07.850> seems<00:02:08.030> to<00:02:08.240> me

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
was pretty good I mean it seems to me

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.580 
was pretty good I mean it seems to me
that<00:02:08.390> it<00:02:08.780> wouldn't<00:02:08.990> be<00:02:09.110> the<00:02:09.229> Senate

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
that it wouldn't be the Senate

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:10.990 
that it wouldn't be the Senate
something's<00:02:10.070> going<00:02:10.220> on<00:02:10.310> around<00:02:10.490> the<00:02:10.640> edges<00:02:10.820> of

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
something's going on around the edges of

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.760 
something's going on around the edges of
these<00:02:11.240> but<00:02:11.510> something<00:02:12.080> something's<00:02:12.500> going<00:02:12.680> on

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
these but something something's going on

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.290 
these but something something's going on
here<00:02:13.040> this<00:02:13.580> has<00:02:13.700> been<00:02:13.730> like<00:02:13.940> this<00:02:14.090> for<00:02:14.270> four

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
here this has been like this for four

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.020 
here this has been like this for four
days<00:02:14.660> I<00:02:15.040> made<00:02:16.040> a<00:02:16.070> couple<00:02:16.220> videos<00:02:16.400> about<00:02:16.760> it<00:02:16.940> i

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
days I made a couple videos about it i

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.600 
days I made a couple videos about it i
haven't<00:02:17.270> uploaded<00:02:17.450> in<00:02:17.690> yet<00:02:17.900> but<00:02:18.020> i<00:02:18.430> mean<00:02:19.430> i've

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
haven't uploaded in yet but i mean i've

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.610 
haven't uploaded in yet but i mean i've
been<00:02:20.480> documenting<00:02:20.990> it<00:02:21.110> for<00:02:21.260> a<00:02:21.290> couple<00:02:21.380> days

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
been documenting it for a couple days

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.150 
been documenting it for a couple days
and<00:02:21.680> i<00:02:22.600> guess<00:02:23.600> we<00:02:23.750> should<00:02:23.930> I'm<00:02:24.770> sure<00:02:24.950> there's

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
and i guess we should I'm sure there's

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.560 
and i guess we should I'm sure there's
an<00:02:25.280> airport<00:02:25.460> here<00:02:25.880> somewhere<00:02:26.240> probably

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
an airport here somewhere probably

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:31.150 
an airport here somewhere probably
there's<00:02:27.470> one<00:02:27.650> right<00:02:27.770> there<00:02:28.450> see<00:02:29.450> that<00:02:30.160> right

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
there's one right there see that right

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.710 
there's one right there see that right
there<00:02:32.200> so<00:02:33.610> that<00:02:34.610> could<00:02:34.790> be<00:02:34.850> at<00:02:35.240> center<00:02:35.540> could

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
there so that could be at center could

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:42.320 
there so that could be at center could
be<00:02:35.840> off<00:02:35.990> just<00:02:36.260> a<00:02:36.350> little

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.910 

but<00:02:42.930> we<00:02:43.020> should<00:02:43.170> just<00:02:43.350> take<00:02:43.470> a<00:02:43.500> look<00:02:43.680> at<00:02:43.800> this

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
but we should just take a look at this

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
but we should just take a look at this
area<00:02:44.310> anyways<00:02:44.700> just<00:02:44.970> for<00:02:45.210> the<00:02:45.270> hell<00:02:45.390> of<00:02:45.420> it

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
area anyways just for the hell of it

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.560 
area anyways just for the hell of it
just<00:02:47.940> out<00:02:48.450> of<00:02:48.560> surrounding<00:02:49.560> areas<00:02:50.570> besides

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
just out of surrounding areas besides

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:56.600 
just out of surrounding areas besides
the<00:02:51.840> airport<00:02:54.140> but<00:02:55.140> I<00:02:55.170> mean<00:02:55.440> you<00:02:55.560> see<00:02:55.770> why<00:02:56.550> is

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
the airport but I mean you see why is

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.370 
the airport but I mean you see why is
there<00:02:57.030> a<00:02:58.340> rate<00:02:59.340> rise<00:02:59.730> there<00:03:00.030> whether<00:03:00.240> just<00:03:01.200> in

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
there a rate rise there whether just in

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.550 
there a rate rise there whether just in
circular<00:03:02.010> patterns<00:03:02.900> that<00:03:03.900> doesn't<00:03:04.230> make<00:03:04.290> that

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
circular patterns that doesn't make that

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.350 
circular patterns that doesn't make that
that<00:03:04.800> just<00:03:05.040> shows<00:03:05.250> you<00:03:05.430> right<00:03:05.580> there<00:03:05.820> that's

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
that just shows you right there that's

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.840 
that just shows you right there that's
those<00:03:06.660> are<00:03:06.890> Doppler<00:03:07.890> radar<00:03:08.250> returns<00:03:08.640> or

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
those are Doppler radar returns or

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.010 
those are Doppler radar returns or
