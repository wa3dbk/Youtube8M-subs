00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.850
 challenges secondary missions mini-games 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.650
 and a 20-hour story mode what 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.470

 places to go and enemies that 

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:46.699
 exterminate simply spectacular to 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:49.729
 this is added many characters and 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:50.439
 lots of side missions number 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:53.059

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:56.539
 assassin's believes the saga assassin's believe 

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:57.409
 he knew how to look on xbox 360 with titles 

00:04:56.539 --> 00:04:59.209
 as terror 

00:04:57.409 --> 00:05:01.879
 'assassin's creed' 1 and 'assassin's 

00:04:59.209 --> 00:05:04.279
 creed ' 2 although it lowered the level a bit 

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:06.979
 with revelations or lacked objectives 

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:09.079
 morals with 'assassin's creed' 3 rebounded 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:11.329
 now with 'assassin's creed' 4 black 

00:05:09.079 --> 00:05:14.809
 flag that in my opinion is the best of the 

00:05:11.329 --> 00:05:16.669
 series landscapes beautiful originality one 

00:05:14.809 --> 00:05:18.559
 great story are one of the many 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:20.629
 characteristics that stand out 

00:05:18.559 --> 00:05:22.729
 Assassin's believes and positions them 

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:26.529
 as one of the best franchises for 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:28.729
 xbox and for the other consoles number 2 

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:31.159
 remember that two minutes ago they 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:33.649
 I was talking about fallout 3 with a map 

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:36.529
 big many characters and lots of 

00:05:33.649 --> 00:05:38.809
 Good secondary missions multiply 

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:40.470
 all that for 10 and as a result 

00:05:38.809 --> 00:05:42.000
 get sky link 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.920
 add also all the 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.290
 characteristics of Nordic mythology 

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:49.080
 as the ability to perform acts 

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:50.610
 magical the appearance of dragons and other 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.400
 so many creatures that we will leave 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:55.980
 finding us on our way after 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:58.200
 have played it for about 70 hours still 

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.970
 keep finding new missions or 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.640
 new caves that investigated new 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:04.320
 swords you find is simply the 

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:07.650
 best RPG that exists for 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:10.230
 xbox360 and for many the best game of 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:13.320
 all number one 

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:15.960
 gta 5 I think I've never been waiting 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:18.860
 as much a game for as many years as 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:21.270
 I did with gta 5 the wait was worth it 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:23.940
 we have everything that reproaches we are going 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:26.100
 gta 4 and that we loved gta san andreas 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:28.530
 in a game that for many is the best 

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:30.750
 story game I do not know if it 's the 

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:33.360
 better but I'm sure if it's the most 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:35.850
 ambitious the map is even bigger 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.950
 that red dead redemption seizes everything 

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:40.860
 good of the gta and do it 10 times 

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:43.110
 better and with more things for more than 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:45.120
 we have passed all the missions so much 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:47.520
 secondary as main is 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:49.720
 impossible to get bored 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:52.030
 It is definitely the best gta of the 

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:55.020
 story and for me the best game I have 

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:57.490
 played on xbox360 without a doubt 

00:06:55.020 --> 00:07:00.340
 well this was all I hope you have 

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:02.610
 I like to see you and have a good 

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:02.610
 day
