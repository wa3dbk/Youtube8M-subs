t-shirt<00:03:49.330> got<00:03:50.320> the<00:03:50.440> chunks<00:03:50.799> out<00:03:51.120> rinsed<00:03:52.120> out

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
t-shirt got the chunks out rinsed out

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:56.340

the<00:03:52.600> tank<00:03:53.049> with<00:03:53.200> water<00:03:53.880> then<00:03:55.079> filled<00:03:56.079> it<00:03:56.200> back

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
the tank with water then filled it back

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.289 
the tank with water then filled it back
up<00:03:56.829> let<00:03:57.040> it<00:03:57.070> sit<00:03:57.340> for<00:03:57.370> about<00:03:57.519> another<00:03:57.640> 12<00:03:58.060> hours

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
up let it sit for about another 12 hours

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:01.259 
up let it sit for about another 12 hours
and<00:03:58.900> that<00:03:59.530> pretty<00:04:00.070> much<00:04:00.280> took<00:04:00.459> every<00:04:01.120> bit<00:04:01.209> of

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
and that pretty much took every bit of

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:03.449 
and that pretty much took every bit of
rust<00:04:01.570> that<00:04:01.660> was<00:04:01.750> in<00:04:01.989> the<00:04:02.079> tank<00:04:02.459> completely

rust that was in the tank completely

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:06.150 
rust that was in the tank completely
laminated<00:04:04.269> it<00:04:04.329> down<00:04:04.480> to<00:04:04.600> bare<00:04:04.750> metal<00:04:05.049> and<00:04:05.320> that

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
laminated it down to bare metal and that

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.300 
laminated it down to bare metal and that
rinsed<00:04:06.459> out<00:04:06.579> let<00:04:06.850> it<00:04:06.970> dry<00:04:07.239> and<00:04:07.750> then<00:04:07.810> I<00:04:08.470> shifted

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
rinsed out let it dry and then I shifted

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.970 
rinsed out let it dry and then I shifted

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:01.229 
tees in those from the inside so that I

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:02.689 
tees in those from the inside so that I
wouldn't<00:05:01.469> get<00:05:01.560> any<00:05:01.710> this<00:05:01.800> cream<00:05:02.099> down<00:05:02.280> inside

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:02.699 
wouldn't get any this cream down inside

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:04.640 
wouldn't get any this cream down inside
that<00:05:02.729> line<00:05:03.240> where<00:05:03.539> it<00:05:03.629> goes<00:05:03.780> out<00:05:03.990> to<00:05:04.020> the<00:05:04.289> to

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
that line where it goes out to the to

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.029 
that line where it goes out to the to
the<00:05:04.830> petcock<00:05:05.310> and<00:05:05.550> things<00:05:05.759> so<00:05:06.439> fill<00:05:07.439> that<00:05:07.620> up<00:05:07.680> I

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:08.039 
the petcock and things so fill that up I

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:11.239 
the petcock and things so fill that up I
put<00:05:08.490> a<00:05:08.520> piece<00:05:08.939> of<00:05:08.969> plastic<00:05:10.009> saran<00:05:11.009> wrap

00:05:11.239 --> 00:05:11.249 
put a piece of plastic saran wrap

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:13.309 
put a piece of plastic saran wrap
underneath<00:05:11.819> the<00:05:12.090> fuel<00:05:12.360> cap<00:05:12.629> when<00:05:12.840> I<00:05:12.900> put<00:05:13.080> it<00:05:13.169> on

00:05:13.309 --> 00:05:13.319 
underneath the fuel cap when I put it on

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:15.830 
underneath the fuel cap when I put it on
so<00:05:13.349> that<00:05:13.620> when<00:05:13.710> I<00:05:13.770> rotated<00:05:14.219> the<00:05:14.430> the<00:05:15.270> tank<00:05:15.569> it

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
so that when I rotated the the tank it

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.779 
so that when I rotated the the tank it
wouldn't<00:05:16.110> leak<00:05:16.229> at<00:05:16.439> anywhere<00:05:16.919> one<00:05:17.340> thing<00:05:17.610> this

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:17.789 
wouldn't leak at anywhere one thing this

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:20.689 
wouldn't leak at anywhere one thing this
does<00:05:18.029> have<00:05:18.469> M<00:05:19.469> ek<00:05:19.889> and<00:05:20.099> so<00:05:20.279> it<00:05:20.400> does<00:05:20.520> eat

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:20.699 
does have M ek and so it does eat

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:23.450 
does have M ek and so it does eat
plastic<00:05:20.969> pretty<00:05:21.449> quickly<00:05:21.689> so<00:05:22.069> make<00:05:23.069> sure<00:05:23.129> as

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
plastic pretty quickly so make sure as

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.209 
plastic pretty quickly so make sure as
soon<00:05:23.520> as<00:05:23.699> you<00:05:23.819> take<00:05:24.090> the<00:05:24.210> cap<00:05:24.449> off<00:05:25.069> get<00:05:26.069> rid<00:05:26.189> of

00:05:26.209 --> 00:05:26.219 
soon as you take the cap off get rid of

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:27.619 
soon as you take the cap off get rid of
that<00:05:26.340> plastic<00:05:26.879> so<00:05:26.999> it<00:05:27.090> doesn't<00:05:27.300> eat<00:05:27.389> through

00:05:27.619 --> 00:05:27.629 
that plastic so it doesn't eat through

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:29.929 
that plastic so it doesn't eat through
it<00:05:27.779> and<00:05:27.930> get<00:05:28.050> on<00:05:28.139> the<00:05:28.349> on<00:05:28.620> the<00:05:28.800> lid<00:05:29.219> if<00:05:29.729> you<00:05:29.819> get

00:05:29.929 --> 00:05:29.939 
it and get on the on the lid if you get

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:31.369 
it and get on the on the lid if you get
a<00:05:29.969> little<00:05:30.029> bit<00:05:30.210> on<00:05:30.240> the<00:05:30.449> inside<00:05:30.569> of<00:05:30.810> the<00:05:30.900> cap<00:05:31.110> it

00:05:31.369 --> 00:05:31.379 
a little bit on the inside of the cap it

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:32.990 
a little bit on the inside of the cap it
doesn't<00:05:31.650> seem<00:05:31.770> to<00:05:31.889> be<00:05:32.009> too<00:05:32.189> big<00:05:32.340> of<00:05:32.460> a<00:05:32.520> deal<00:05:32.669> but

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
doesn't seem to be too big of a deal but

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.149 
doesn't seem to be too big of a deal but
to<00:05:33.569> try<00:05:33.750> to<00:05:33.779> prevent<00:05:34.080> that<00:05:34.229> but<00:05:34.650> anyway<00:05:35.009> it

00:05:35.149 --> 00:05:35.159 
to try to prevent that but anyway it

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:36.769 
to try to prevent that but anyway it
seemed<00:05:35.370> to<00:05:35.430> be<00:05:35.460> a<00:05:35.520> real<00:05:35.699> good<00:05:35.789> product<00:05:36.240> sets<00:05:36.539> up

00:05:36.769 --> 00:05:36.779 
seemed to be a real good product sets up

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:38.990 
seemed to be a real good product sets up
it<00:05:37.590> takes<00:05:37.740> about<00:05:37.860> 40<00:05:38.219> minutes<00:05:38.250> to<00:05:38.580> treat<00:05:38.849> the
