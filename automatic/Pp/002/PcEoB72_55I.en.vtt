00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
feeling about the team at this point of

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.510 
feeling about the team at this point of
the<00:01:13.020> season<00:01:13.520> uh-oh<00:01:14.580> I<00:01:15.979> don't<00:01:16.979> know<00:01:17.189> if<00:01:17.369> I'm

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
the season uh-oh I don't know if I'm

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.240 
the season uh-oh I don't know if I'm

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
I think it'll be a good idea to get a

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.999 
I think it'll be a good idea to get a
change<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.530> scenery

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
change of scenery

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.149 
change of scenery
because<00:01:23.850> Gerald<00:01:24.270> Green<00:01:24.509> is<00:01:24.750> who<00:01:25.710> knows<00:01:25.920> when

he's coming back he's gonna be out for a

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.920

the<00:02:24.209> Miami<00:02:24.840> Heat<00:02:25.550> the<00:02:26.550> New<00:02:26.730> York<00:02:26.760> Knicks<00:02:27.290> all

the Miami Heat the New York Knicks all

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.979 
the Miami Heat the New York Knicks all
those<00:02:29.010> teams<00:02:29.310> would<00:02:29.580> be<00:02:29.730> a<00:02:29.760> good<00:02:30.030> fit<00:02:30.330> so<00:02:30.690> I

those teams would be a good fit so I

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.780
