00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
the HTC One m8 and the HTC One to find

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.940 
the HTC One m8 and the HTC One to find
out<00:00:09.510> of<00:00:09.660> course<00:00:09.929> what<00:00:10.200> makes<00:00:10.410> this<00:00:10.620> to<00:00:10.800> the

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
out of course what makes this to the

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:19.519 
out of course what makes this to the
device<00:00:11.160> is<00:00:11.370> different<00:00:17.510> so<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.660> 18<00:00:18.960> came<00:00:19.320> out

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
device is different so the 18 came out

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.400 
device is different so the 18 came out
today<00:00:20.010> and<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.970> HTC<00:00:21.300> One<00:00:21.539> came<00:00:21.960> out<00:00:22.080> last<00:00:22.230> year

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
today and the HTC One came out last year

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.400 
today and the HTC One came out last year
and<00:00:22.740> they<00:00:23.490> have<00:00:23.789> some<00:00:24.060> similarities<00:00:24.510> but<00:00:25.230> a

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
and they have some similarities but a

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.769 
and they have some similarities but a
lot<00:00:25.859> of<00:00:25.890> differences<00:00:26.609> now<00:00:26.970> both<00:00:27.240> devices<00:00:27.570> of

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
lot of differences now both devices of

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.870 
lot of differences now both devices of
course<00:00:27.960> I<00:00:28.050> made<00:00:28.199> by<00:00:28.349> HTC<00:00:28.670> but<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.760> difference

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
course I made by HTC but the difference

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.620 
course I made by HTC but the difference
is<00:00:30.240> basically<00:00:30.990> start<00:00:31.410> after<00:00:32.070> that<00:00:32.210> now<00:00:33.210> in

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
is basically start after that now in

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.840 
is basically start after that now in
terms<00:00:33.690> of<00:00:34.079> design<00:00:34.410> you<00:00:34.620> do<00:00:34.860> have<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.160> similar

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
terms of design you do have the similar

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.970 
terms of design you do have the similar
unibody<00:00:36.660> design<00:00:36.780> but<00:00:37.380> there<00:00:37.770> are<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:37.860> lot<00:00:37.950> of

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
unibody design but there are a lot of

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.619 
unibody design but there are a lot of
changes<00:00:38.430> but<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.610> first<00:00:38.910> thing<00:00:39.059> you<00:00:39.210> notice

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
changes but the first thing you notice

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.240 
changes but the first thing you notice
is<00:00:39.840> at<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.350> back<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.739> camera<00:00:41.010> it's<00:00:41.160> why

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
is at the back and the camera it's why

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.740 
is at the back and the camera it's why
I'm<00:00:41.309> showing<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:41.579> that<00:00:41.730> because<00:00:42.059> you<00:00:42.570> do<00:00:42.719> have

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
I'm showing you that because you do have

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.229 
I'm showing you that because you do have
this<00:00:43.200> dual<00:00:43.710> camera<00:00:44.280> it's<00:00:44.430> what<00:00:44.579> agency<00:00:45.000> calls

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
this dual camera it's what agency calls

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.440 
this dual camera it's what agency calls
it<00:00:45.420> do<00:00:46.260> altra<00:00:46.829> pixel<00:00:47.399> camera<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:47.910> then<00:00:48.329> you

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
it do altra pixel camera and then you

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.970 
it do altra pixel camera and then you
have<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.600> single<00:00:48.809> ultrapixel<00:00:49.440> camera<00:00:49.469> on<00:00:49.860> the

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
have a single ultrapixel camera on the

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.150 
have a single ultrapixel camera on the
HTC<00:00:50.280> One<00:00:50.670> only<00:00:51.329> on<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.870> One<00:00:52.079> m8<00:00:52.410> you<00:00:52.620> have<00:00:52.770> dual

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
HTC One only on the One m8 you have dual

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.490 
HTC One only on the One m8 you have dual
flash<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.850> LED<00:00:54.690> flash<00:00:54.719> you've<00:00:55.110> got<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.289> single

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
flash and LED flash you've got a single

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.490 
flash and LED flash you've got a single
LED<00:00:56.010> flash<00:00:56.280> here<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.539> you<00:00:58.050> know<00:00:58.140> that's

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
LED flash here and and you know that's

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.170 
LED flash here and and you know that's
where<00:00:58.829> this<00:00:59.010> is<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.250> lot<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.460> differences<00:00:59.850> there

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
where this is a lot of differences there

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.830 
where this is a lot of differences there
now<00:01:00.449> in<00:01:00.780> terms<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.230> design<00:01:01.410> this<00:01:02.309> has<00:01:02.520> that

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
now in terms of the design this has that

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.840 
now in terms of the design this has that
unibody<00:01:03.840> metal<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.589> then<00:01:04.830> plastic<00:01:05.610> on<00:01:05.820> the

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
unibody metal and then plastic on the

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.240 
unibody metal and then plastic on the
side<00:01:06.180> you've<00:01:06.420> got<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:06.689> volume<00:01:07.080> button<00:01:08.070> this

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
side you've got that volume button this

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.550 
side you've got that volume button this
kind<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.460> one<00:01:08.640> button<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.210> then<00:01:09.600> kind<00:01:10.470> of

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
kind of one button and then kind of

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.609 
kind of one button and then kind of
banks<00:01:11.280> around<00:01:11.400> with<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.700> plastic<00:01:11.939> bill<00:01:12.479> now<00:01:13.260> the

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
banks around with a plastic bill now the

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.090 
banks around with a plastic bill now the
HTC<00:01:14.100> One<00:01:14.490> m8<00:01:15.000> is<00:01:15.360> metal<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.470> metal<00:01:16.619> so<00:01:16.950> it's

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
HTC One m8 is metal to metal so it's

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.359 
HTC One m8 is metal to metal so it's
metal<00:01:17.520> all<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.850> way<00:01:18.240> around<00:01:19.229> from<00:01:20.130> edge<00:01:20.340> to

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
metal all the way around from edge to

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.770 
metal all the way around from edge to
edge<00:01:21.170> top<00:01:22.170> except<00:01:23.070> bottom<00:01:23.490> except<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.509> top

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
edge top except bottom except the top

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.109 
edge top except bottom except the top
here<00:01:25.080> where<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:25.409> have<00:01:25.590> your<00:01:25.619> IR<00:01:26.549> blaster<00:01:26.939> and

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
here where you have your IR blaster and

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.120 
here where you have your IR blaster and
then<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:28.320> also<00:01:28.439> have<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.680> couple<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:28.950> things

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
then you also have a couple of things

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.910 
then you also have a couple of things
here<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:29.430> have<00:01:29.610> your<00:01:29.990> micro<00:01:30.990> SD<00:01:31.229> card<00:01:31.530> slot<00:01:31.619> so

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
here you have your micro SD card slot so

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.649 
here you have your micro SD card slot so
there<00:01:32.220> is<00:01:32.340> actually<00:01:32.670> micro<00:01:32.970> SD<00:01:33.240> card

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
there is actually micro SD card

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.020 
there is actually micro SD card
expansion<00:01:33.990> on<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.380> HTC<00:01:35.130> One<00:01:35.400> there<00:01:35.700> is<00:01:35.820> no

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
expansion on the HTC One there is no

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.390 
expansion on the HTC One there is no
microSD<00:01:36.540> card<00:01:36.750> expansion<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.530> then<00:01:38.100> this<00:01:38.250> is

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
microSD card expansion and then this is

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.179 
microSD card expansion and then this is
where<00:01:38.549> your<00:01:38.670> micro<00:01:39.000> sim<00:01:39.299> is<00:01:39.540> so<00:01:39.990> that's<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:41.040> lot

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
where your micro sim is so that's a lot

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.469 
where your micro sim is so that's a lot
of<00:01:41.220> differences<00:01:41.729> there<00:01:42.000> between<00:01:42.150> both

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
of differences there between both

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.450 
of differences there between both
devices<00:01:42.780> now<00:01:43.439> we<00:01:43.500> flip<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:43.829> around<00:01:44.009> actually

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
devices now we flip it around actually

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.520 
devices now we flip it around actually
flip<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.820> top<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.630> IR<00:01:45.930> blasters<00:01:46.320> on<00:01:46.439> the

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
flip to the top the IR blasters on the

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.710 
flip to the top the IR blasters on the
top<00:01:46.770> as<00:01:47.340> well<00:01:47.520> as<00:01:47.610> your<00:01:47.759> power<00:01:48.030> button<00:01:48.210> and

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
top as well as your power button and

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.690 
top as well as your power button and
it's<00:01:49.680> actually<00:01:49.799> you<00:01:50.009> can<00:01:50.159> see<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.399> smaller

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
it's actually you can see the smaller

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.139 
it's actually you can see the smaller
area<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.899> then<00:01:52.170> here<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:53.220> do<00:01:53.369> have<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:53.610> larger

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
area and then here you do have a larger

which means the microUSB has been

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.780 
which means the microUSB has been
shifted<00:02:40.260> a<00:02:40.349> little<00:02:40.469> bit<00:02:40.620> compared<00:02:41.489> to<00:02:41.639> what

shifted a little bit compared to what
you<00:02:41.909> have<00:02:42.180> here<00:02:42.629> on<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.889> bottom<00:02:44.639> now<00:02:45.359> in<00:02:45.840> terms

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
you have here on the bottom now in terms

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:47.960 
you have here on the bottom now in terms
of<00:02:46.200> processors<00:02:46.739> are<00:02:46.950> also<00:02:47.099> a<00:02:47.250> big<00:02:47.519> change<00:02:47.819> in

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
of processors are also a big change in

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.750 
of processors are also a big change in
processes<00:02:48.510> between<00:02:48.840> both<00:02:49.109> devices<00:02:49.439> this<00:02:50.340> use

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
processes between both devices this use

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.479 
processes between both devices this use
a<00:02:51.000> Snapdragon<00:02:51.659> 600<00:02:52.290> this<00:02:52.560> is<00:02:52.680> now<00:02:52.829> Snapdragon

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
a Snapdragon 600 this is now Snapdragon

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.179 
a Snapdragon 600 this is now Snapdragon
801<00:02:53.730> so<00:02:54.060> especially<00:02:54.299> much<00:02:54.959> faster<00:02:55.439> both<00:02:55.919> have

00:02:56.179 --> 00:02:56.189 
801 so especially much faster both have

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:59.330 
801 so especially much faster both have

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
two gigabytes of RAM in there in both

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.349 
two gigabytes of RAM in there in both

of<00:03:34.199> the<00:03:34.290> differences<00:03:34.650> you<00:03:34.949> will<00:03:35.069> find<00:03:35.400> with

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:35.909 
of the differences you will find with

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:39.379 
of the differences you will find with
the<00:03:36.239> HTC<00:03:36.810> One<00:03:37.079> m8<00:03:37.379> and<00:03:37.590> the<00:03:38.040> HTC<00:03:38.430> One<00:03:38.699> hopefully

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:39.389 
the HTC One m8 and the HTC One hopefully

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:41.750 
the HTC One m8 and the HTC One hopefully
that<00:03:39.479> gives<00:03:39.599> a<00:03:39.750> clear<00:03:39.989> idea<00:03:40.139> on<00:03:41.010> what<00:03:41.459> the

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
that gives a clear idea on what the

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.490 
that gives a clear idea on what the
hardware<00:03:42.299> differences<00:03:42.540> are<00:03:42.989> between<00:03:43.019> both

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
hardware differences are between both

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.399 
hardware differences are between both
devices<00:03:43.829> you've<00:03:44.669> got<00:03:44.939> new<00:03:45.720> hardware<00:03:46.229> all

devices you've got new hardware all

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:48.589

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
around from the camera from the from the

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:51.710 
around from the camera from the from the
build<00:03:48.989> itself<00:03:49.500> and<00:03:49.829> also<00:03:50.299> you<00:03:51.299> know<00:03:51.419> even<00:03:51.659> the

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
build itself and also you know even the

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.469 
build itself and also you know even the
front<00:03:51.900> facing<00:03:52.169> camera<00:03:52.500> is<00:03:52.560> new<00:03:53.340> a<00:03:53.879> couple<00:03:54.359> of

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:54.479 
front facing camera is new a couple of

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:56.599 
front facing camera is new a couple of
things<00:03:54.659> also<00:03:54.840> missing<00:03:55.349> beats<00:03:55.739> audio<00:03:55.979> is<00:03:56.400> no

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609 
things also missing beats audio is no

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:59.420 
things also missing beats audio is no
longer<00:03:56.849> with<00:03:57.180> HTC<00:03:58.139> so<00:03:58.409> no<00:03:58.620> longer<00:03:59.040> beats<00:03:59.280> are

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
longer with HTC so no longer beats are

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.399 
longer with HTC so no longer beats are
