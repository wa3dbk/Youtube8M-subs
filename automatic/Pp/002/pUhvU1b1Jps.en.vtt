money to continue doing YouTube and the
extra<00:00:52.680> income<00:00:52.949> probably<00:00:53.340> won't<00:00:53.520> affect<00:00:53.820> the

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
extra income probably won't affect the

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.939 
extra income probably won't affect the
videos<00:00:54.270> in<00:00:54.480> any<00:00:54.660> way<00:00:54.840> at<00:00:54.989> all<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.379> I've<00:00:55.800> been

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
videos in any way at all and I've been

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.500 
videos in any way at all and I've been
asked<00:00:56.280> before<00:00:56.370> why<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:56.789> don't<00:00:57.180> accept

asked before why I don't accept
donations<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:58.379> this<00:00:58.559> is<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.890> reason<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.670> ads

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
donations and this is the reason the ads

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.610 
donations and this is the reason the ads
pay<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.359> bills<00:01:00.570> so<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:00.930> don't<00:01:01.079> have<00:01:01.350> to
