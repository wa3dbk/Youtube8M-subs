00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:09.840
 hello people here is europe again today 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.490
 there is again a follow guide to two 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.380
 done great in the call of duty 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.059
 campaign and I think we catch 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.640
 still the same with the first performance of 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.710
 this is how the ants are 20 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.570
 gamerscore or a bronze 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.580
 trophy and the description of this 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.010
 Success is destroying them all 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.660
 enemy ground targets without allies 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.429
 to kill with the rods 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.009
 yes you can this success in the 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.380
 mission loki do in this mission 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.079
 Are you on the space station or in the 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.910
 universe and yes you have to all first 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.440
 Kill an opponent after that comes on sometime 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.710
 a point where he has a space capsule 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.239
 would have to pronounce a kind of capsule and 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.399
 yes, if you have them open 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.320
 you have to kill some opponents and 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.329
 then you take over a computer and 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.460
 this computer gives you access 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.980
 on the weapon systems of the satellite 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.199
 and yes you will be in this 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.289
 computer in and then be in 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.579
 a drone trend respectively 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:04.710
 become drone of that 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.990
 see battlefield and you have to 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.479
 all the opponents kill so they will 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.970
 are highlighted in orange your allied 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.040
 marked blue and your goal is all 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.990
 So kill all orange targets too 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.729
 kill and all blue targets too 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.890
 spare because the blue ones are yours 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.170
 allied and I did that 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.659
 which goals are displayed 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.520
 actually are marked as big and 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.590
 as soon as you killed this one 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.000
 then you have destroyed 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.680
 it would have to go further right away 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.990
 First destroy the small targets and 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.400
 afterwards only the mainly marked ones 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.090
 Go ahead because you have to have all the goals 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.500
 to destroy 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.570
 and when he first hits the big goals 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.640
 destroyed then it goes on automatically 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.380
 in the next position and therefore 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.119
 I would give you as a tip only the first 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.829
 destroying small targets and then the 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.659
 Great at the first time it is not 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.280
 problem any allies too 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.350
 because there are no there 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.180
 allies displayed on the map when 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.969
 second time you have to start in front and 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.590
 continue to work behind him because he 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.960
 Camera from the drone goes on and on 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.450
 and it has to be fast and easy 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.100
 on it if you rocket with these and 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.600
 always be careful so you do not 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.700
 allies meets with the third man 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.950
 you have to start from the top and after 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.629
 continue down the bottom right and as soon as you 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.370
 then get out of the computer again 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:17.040
 Do you really have to do that too ? 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:20.129
 get success and thus has 420 on 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.180
 the asco or a bronzetafel ever 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:23.520
 received again 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.739
 the second success I will give you in this 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.099
 video show we are konsolero gives 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:30.930
 whole 40 gamerscore or one bronze 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:33.300
 pressure away and the description of this 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.849
 success loud chase city pressure of 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.920
 regulators on the first try high 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:40.260
 You will find this success in the mission 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.400
 Atlas falls and in this fair and 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.170
 Will you eventually become one? 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.610
 to meet hostile defense 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.550
 You just have to do it 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.620
 tackle all the opponents kill someday 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.930
 the airplane will come that you too 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.989
 will pick up and then all the opponents 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.790
 Kill inside this room 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.950
 then he would have to go in and 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.680
 Your other teammate will say that there 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.900
 you have to get the corpse from the desk there 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.370
 create the way and at this point in the 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.470
 then you just have to go to 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.209
 the switchboard and you have to have now 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.010
 with your right stick that is now 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.720
 on console so i do not know how to 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.000
 the on pc is probably with the 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.409
 arrow keys and in any case must 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.690
 now has the right stick the 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:20.879
 keep the beams in the middle area 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.040
 That one comes to the right turbulent 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:25.230
 everything is shaking and yes if you do that 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.120
 did it at the first time that is 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.370
 very important if you fail and 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.739
 Somehow everything has to explode you have to 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.930
 but new the start it does not apply 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.060
 as the first time and thus you have the 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.810
 We renew the mission for success 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.970
 start 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.860
 that would be stupid so try it at 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.209
 first time to create and as soon as you 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.129
 that's done the first time 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.799
 you also get the success 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:48.870
 konsolero and therefore I hope that I 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:51.569
 So join in these two 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.599
 like the ants or konsolero 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:56.220
 could help these two successes 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:57.810
 also have two subscribers of mine in 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.580
 the comments of the last video 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.830
 so i hope that will happen 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.360
 could help the two and 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.760
 I hope that you have the video 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.269
 has fallen again and thus say 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.500
 me once 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:09.500
 Until next time 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.009
 ashamed of it 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:32.729
 of people
