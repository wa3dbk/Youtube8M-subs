00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
of their key plays like debris dragon

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.269 
of their key plays like debris dragon
and<00:00:14.429> quickdraw<00:00:15.240> synchron<00:00:15.690> and<00:00:16.020> you<00:00:16.590> can<00:00:16.770> block

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
and quickdraw synchron and you can block

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.640 
and quickdraw synchron and you can block
some<00:00:17.490> of<00:00:17.550> their<00:00:17.699> attacks<00:00:18.000> with<00:00:18.359> card<00:00:19.020> likes<00:00:19.260> a

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
some of their attacks with card likes a

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.950 
some of their attacks with card likes a
titanium<00:00:20.160> that<00:00:20.910> if<00:00:21.150> they<00:00:21.270> don't<00:00:21.449> have<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.600> token

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
titanium that if they don't have a token

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.349 
titanium that if they don't have a token
maybe<00:00:22.080> they've<00:00:22.920> either<00:00:23.070> put<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.670> facedown<00:00:23.880> or

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
maybe they've either put a facedown or

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.599 
maybe they've either put a facedown or
they'd<00:00:24.510> be<00:00:24.689> forced<00:00:24.900> tribute<00:00:25.320> itself<00:00:25.650> so<00:00:26.220> they

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
they'd be forced tribute itself so they

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.670 
they'd be forced tribute itself so they
probably<00:00:26.789> just<00:00:26.910> let<00:00:27.090> it<00:00:27.180> go<00:00:27.210> face<00:00:27.449> down<00:00:27.500> or<00:00:28.500> you

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
probably just let it go face down or you

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.859 
probably just let it go face down or you
can<00:00:28.800> stop<00:00:28.980> there<00:00:29.189> Caius<00:00:29.599> something<00:00:30.599> like<00:00:30.720> that

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
can stop there Caius something like that

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.540 
can stop there Caius something like that
you<00:00:31.080> know<00:00:31.109> but<00:00:31.800> it's<00:00:31.920> really<00:00:32.130> good<00:00:32.250> against

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
you know but it's really good against

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.709 
you know but it's really good against
the<00:00:32.610> deck<00:00:32.790> since<00:00:32.969> they<00:00:33.059> do<00:00:33.180> so<00:00:33.329> much<00:00:33.390> sink

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
the deck since they do so much sink

growing<00:00:34.020> you<00:00:34.230> can<00:00:34.410> expect<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.770> see<00:00:34.950> them

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
growing you can expect to see them

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.160 
growing you can expect to see them
synchro<00:00:35.520> like<00:00:35.910> once<00:00:36.270> every<00:00:36.570> turn<00:00:36.719> at<00:00:36.930> least

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
synchro like once every turn at least

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.790 
synchro like once every turn at least
and<00:00:38.000> maybe<00:00:39.000> more<00:00:39.329> now<00:00:39.540> since<00:00:39.570> they<00:00:39.989> have<00:00:40.170> glow

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
and maybe more now since they have glow

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.280 
and maybe more now since they have glow

up or grow up bulb spacing on which one
is<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.530> TCG<00:00:44.070> I<00:00:44.309> keep<00:00:44.550> mixing<00:00:44.730> it<00:00:45.149> up<00:00:45.270> but

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
is the TCG I keep mixing it up but

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.470 
is the TCG I keep mixing it up but
regardless<00:00:46.640> really<00:00:47.640> good<00:00:47.760> against<00:00:48.059> them<00:00:48.210> soft

in<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.479> grave<00:01:45.630> not<00:01:45.930> like<00:01:46.140> treeborn<00:01:46.530> frog<00:01:46.590> work

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
in the grave not like treeborn frog work

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.100 
in the grave not like treeborn frog work
and<00:01:47.100> keep<00:01:47.189> going<00:01:47.430> back<00:01:47.549> it<00:01:48.180> might<00:01:48.420> be<00:01:48.600> since<00:01:48.990> it

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
and keep going back it might be since it

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.440 
and keep going back it might be since it
was<00:01:49.229> negated<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:50.490> summon<00:01:50.759> was<00:01:50.880> negated<00:01:51.119> that

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
was negated the summon was negated that

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.420 
was negated the summon was negated that
that<00:01:52.020> encounter<00:01:52.530> towards<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.860> ones<00:01:53.040> /<00:01:53.250> duel

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
that encounter towards the ones / duel

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.179 
that encounter towards the ones / duel
so<00:01:53.640> that's<00:01:53.909> where<00:01:54.090> I'm<00:01:54.360> kind<00:01:55.110> of<00:01:55.140> having<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.590> not

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
so that's where I'm kind of having a not

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.740 
so that's where I'm kind of having a not
sure<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.520> moment<00:01:56.850> about<00:01:56.909> that<00:01:57.210> but<00:01:57.600> still

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
sure a moment about that but still

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.179 
sure a moment about that but still
really<00:01:57.899> good<00:01:58.020> against<00:01:58.380> them<00:01:58.530> soft<00:01:58.829> a<00:01:58.950> lot<00:01:59.100> of

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
really good against them soft a lot of

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.429 
really good against them soft a lot of
it<00:01:59.280> plays<00:01:59.430> you<00:02:00.149> can<00:02:00.299> stop<00:02:00.479> their<00:02:00.689> spoor<00:02:01.020> since

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
it plays you can stop their spoor since

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.530 
it plays you can stop their spoor since
they<00:02:02.130> might<00:02:02.490> be<00:02:02.670> out<00:02:02.790> of<00:02:02.820> removed<00:02:03.329> from<00:02:03.420> play

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
they might be out of removed from play

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.319 
they might be out of removed from play
targets<00:02:04.850> and<00:02:05.850> it's<00:02:05.969> just<00:02:06.090> really<00:02:06.210> good

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
targets and it's just really good

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.430 
targets and it's just really good
against<00:02:06.540> them<00:02:06.719> I<00:02:06.780> guess<00:02:08.060> solemn<00:02:09.060> warning

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
against them I guess solemn warning

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.750 
against them I guess solemn warning
especially<00:02:10.440> good<00:02:10.530> against<00:02:10.830> them<00:02:10.979> stops<00:02:11.370> lot

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
especially good against them stops lot

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.400 
especially good against them stops lot
since<00:02:12.270> bottomless<00:02:12.660> trap<00:02:12.870> hole<00:02:12.900> doesn't<00:02:13.230> do

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
since bottomless trap hole doesn't do

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.670 
since bottomless trap hole doesn't do
too<00:02:13.530> much

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
too much

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.830 
too much
against<00:02:14.010> them<00:02:14.129> like<00:02:14.819> black<00:02:15.090> rose<00:02:15.329> dragon

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
against them like black rose dragon

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.270 
against them like black rose dragon

and Caius really a it probably won't be

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.199 
and Caius really a it probably won't be
making<00:02:31.799> a<00:02:31.920> synchro<00:02:32.430> if<00:02:32.609> they<00:02:32.790> think<00:02:32.849> that<00:02:33.090> it

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
making a synchro if they think that it

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.199 
making a synchro if they think that it
will<00:02:33.269> be<00:02:33.329> bottomless<00:02:33.840> unless<00:02:34.230> it's<00:02:34.409> a<00:02:34.879> drui<00:02:35.879> or

I'm spacing what it is but whatever i'll
think<00:02:48.299> of<00:02:48.419> it<00:02:48.540> later<00:02:48.659> and<00:02:48.780> put<00:02:48.900> in<00:02:48.989> an

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:49.109 
think of it later and put in an

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:51.250 
think of it later and put in an
annotation<00:02:49.500> i'm<00:02:49.709> kind<00:02:49.889> of<00:02:49.919> tired<00:02:50.069> right<00:02:50.310> now

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
annotation i'm kind of tired right now

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.690 
annotation i'm kind of tired right now
but<00:02:52.260> yeah<00:02:52.379> it's<00:02:52.560> off<00:02:52.709> a<00:02:52.739> lot<00:02:52.889> of<00:02:52.919> this<00:02:53.069> stuff<00:02:53.129> so

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
but yeah it's off a lot of this stuff so

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:54.890 
but yeah it's off a lot of this stuff so
bottomless<00:02:54.030> trap<00:02:54.239> hole<00:02:54.269> doesn't<00:02:54.540> do<00:02:54.720> too<00:02:54.870> much

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
bottomless trap hole doesn't do too much

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.629 
bottomless trap hole doesn't do too much
against<00:02:55.319> them<00:02:55.470> most<00:02:55.919> of<00:02:56.010> your<00:02:56.099> monsters<00:02:56.459> are

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:56.639 
against them most of your monsters are

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:58.940 
against them most of your monsters are
smaller<00:02:57.030> than<00:02:57.450> 1500<00:02:58.230> so<00:02:58.409> they'll<00:02:58.560> get<00:02:58.680> around

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
smaller than 1500 so they'll get around

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.339 
smaller than 1500 so they'll get around
it<00:02:59.219> and<00:02:59.450> then<00:03:00.450> they'll<00:03:00.689> just<00:03:00.870> get<00:03:01.019> rid<00:03:01.139> of<00:03:01.200> your

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
it and then they'll just get rid of your

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.199 
it and then they'll just get rid of your
scrap<00:03:01.709> so<00:03:02.219> solemn<00:03:02.579> warning<00:03:02.819> will<00:03:02.939> be<00:03:03.000> able<00:03:03.060> to

having against them will be pushing for
lots<00:03:24.479> of<00:03:24.569> damage<00:03:24.720> and<00:03:25.079> the<00:03:25.169> quick-draw

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
lots of damage and the quick-draw

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.580 
lots of damage and the quick-draw
matchup<00:03:26.190> card<00:03:26.790> advantage<00:03:26.909> takes<00:03:27.840> on<00:03:28.049> less<00:03:28.379> of

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
matchup card advantage takes on less of

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.550 
matchup card advantage takes on less of
an<00:03:28.709> importance<00:03:29.189> because<00:03:29.879> all<00:03:30.540> the<00:03:31.019> new<00:03:31.199> canaan

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
an importance because all the new canaan

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.890 
an importance because all the new canaan
should<00:03:31.769> be<00:03:31.859> doing<00:03:32.129> so<00:03:32.729> and<00:03:33.060> all<00:03:33.269> their<00:03:33.419> tokens

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
should be doing so and all their tokens

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.719 
should be doing so and all their tokens
so<00:03:34.139> you<00:03:34.650> really<00:03:34.919> can't<00:03:35.129> keep<00:03:35.310> up<00:03:35.489> with<00:03:35.639> their

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:35.729 
so you really can't keep up with their

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:37.399 
so you really can't keep up with their
technical<00:03:36.090> card<00:03:36.389> advantage<00:03:36.510> if<00:03:37.049> you<00:03:37.169> count

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:37.409 
technical card advantage if you count

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:40.129 
technical card advantage if you count
tokens<00:03:37.829> towards<00:03:38.189> that<00:03:38.780> so<00:03:39.780> what<00:03:39.959> you<00:03:40.019> should

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:40.139 
tokens towards that so what you should

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:42.050 
tokens towards that so what you should
be<00:03:40.199> doing<00:03:40.229> is<00:03:40.500> focusing<00:03:40.650> more<00:03:41.010> on<00:03:41.069> the<00:03:41.790> raw

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
be doing is focusing more on the raw

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.629 
be doing is focusing more on the raw
damage<00:03:42.659> that<00:03:43.650> doesn't<00:03:43.919> mean<00:03:44.009> playing<00:03:44.189> stupid

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:44.639 
damage that doesn't mean playing stupid

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:47.330 
damage that doesn't mean playing stupid
but<00:03:45.319> don't<00:03:46.319> worry<00:03:46.590> too<00:03:46.799> much<00:03:46.829> about<00:03:46.979> the

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
but don't worry too much about the

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.089 
but don't worry too much about the
numbers<00:03:47.699> of<00:03:47.939> who<00:03:48.060> has<00:03:48.239> what<00:03:48.739> so<00:03:49.739> you<00:03:49.799> can<00:03:49.979> be

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 
numbers of who has what so you can be

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:53.360 
numbers of who has what so you can be
like<00:03:50.900> you<00:03:51.900> can<00:03:52.049> very<00:03:52.259> easily<00:03:52.349> get<00:03:52.799> a<00:03:52.829> to<00:03:53.159> turn

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
like you can very easily get a to turn

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.280 
like you can very easily get a to turn
KO<00:03:53.699> against<00:03:54.090> them<00:03:54.329> if<00:03:54.419> not<00:03:54.540> a<00:03:54.599> one-turn<00:03:55.019> kale

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
KO against them if not a one-turn kale

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.009 
KO against them if not a one-turn kale
because<00:03:56.129> they'll<00:03:56.639> have<00:03:56.849> a<00:03:56.879> token<00:03:57.389> or<00:03:57.479> a<00:03:57.540> Raikou

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
because they'll have a token or a Raikou

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.920 
because they'll have a token or a Raikou
set<00:03:58.319> or<00:03:58.590> dandelion<00:03:59.340> even<00:04:00.090> and<00:04:00.269> they<00:04:00.629> can<00:04:00.900> be

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
set or dandelion even and they can be

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.689 
set or dandelion even and they can be
like<00:04:01.939> scirocco<00:04:02.939> Bora<00:04:03.449> and<00:04:03.989> then<00:04:04.919> pump<00:04:05.579> the

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:05.699 
like scirocco Bora and then pump the

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:07.819 
like scirocco Bora and then pump the
Bora<00:04:05.909> attack<00:04:06.329> over<00:04:06.599> the<00:04:06.720> token<00:04:07.109> that's<00:04:07.500> almost

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
Bora attack over the token that's almost

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:09.559 
Bora attack over the token that's almost
half<00:04:08.040> their<00:04:08.250> life<00:04:08.430> right<00:04:08.669> there<00:04:08.699> and<00:04:09.209> then<00:04:09.419> if

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
half their life right there and then if

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:11.869 
half their life right there and then if
you<00:04:09.659> have<00:04:09.840> a<00:04:10.139> collude<00:04:10.620> that'll<00:04:11.370> be<00:04:11.430> a<00:04:11.459> to<00:04:11.669> turn

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:11.879 
you have a collude that'll be a to turn

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:15.649 
you have a collude that'll be a to turn
KO<00:04:12.150> so<00:04:13.280> you<00:04:14.280> can<00:04:14.400> very<00:04:14.579> easily<00:04:14.729> push<00:04:15.269> over<00:04:15.540> them

00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:15.659 
KO so you can very easily push over them

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:17.270 
KO so you can very easily push over them
for<00:04:15.870> game<00:04:16.019> and<00:04:16.289> then<00:04:16.620> you<00:04:16.680> also<00:04:16.829> have<00:04:16.949> the

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
for game and then you also have the

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.789 
for game and then you also have the
armed<00:04:17.699> wing<00:04:17.909> that<00:04:18.060> will<00:04:18.239> do<00:04:18.389> that<00:04:18.599> so<00:04:19.530> it's

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
armed wing that will do that so it's

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.339 
armed wing that will do that so it's
very<00:04:19.949> easy<00:04:20.159> to<00:04:20.340> push<00:04:20.699> for<00:04:20.880> game<00:04:21.690> in<00:04:21.870> a<00:04:21.930> to<00:04:22.139> turn

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:22.349 
very easy to push for game in a to turn

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:24.110 
very easy to push for game in a to turn
KO<00:04:22.620> against<00:04:22.979> them<00:04:23.219> and<00:04:23.310> they<00:04:23.430> don't<00:04:23.880> have<00:04:24.029> a

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
KO against them and they don't have a

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.610 
KO against them and they don't have a
whole<00:04:24.300> lot<00:04:24.330> to<00:04:24.570> stop<00:04:24.779> that<00:04:24.990> considering<00:04:25.529> that

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
whole lot to stop that considering that

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.110 
whole lot to stop that considering that
they<00:04:25.770> don't<00:04:25.950> play<00:04:26.099> much<00:04:26.250> removal<00:04:26.729> anymore

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
they don't play much removal anymore

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.640 
they don't play much removal anymore
they<00:04:27.240> focus<00:04:27.600> more<00:04:27.630> on<00:04:27.810> cards<00:04:28.260> like<00:04:28.410> royal

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
they focus more on cards like royal

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.920 
they focus more on cards like royal
decree<00:04:29.010> meaning<00:04:29.910> they're<00:04:30.060> only<00:04:30.300> removal<00:04:30.780> will

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
decree meaning they're only removal will

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.689 
decree meaning they're only removal will
probably<00:04:31.320> be<00:04:31.410> cards<00:04:31.860> like<00:04:31.979> book<00:04:32.160> moon<00:04:32.400> and

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:32.699 
probably be cards like book moon and

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:34.760 
probably be cards like book moon and
maybe<00:04:33.330> one<00:04:33.660> or<00:04:33.750> two<00:04:33.780> random<00:04:34.260> traps<00:04:34.530> like<00:04:34.710> a

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
maybe one or two random traps like a

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.840 
maybe one or two random traps like a
mirror<00:04:35.040> force<00:04:35.280> I<00:04:36.120> believes<00:04:36.690> the<00:04:37.850> quick-draw

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
mirror force I believes the quick-draw

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.510 
mirror force I believes the quick-draw
deck<00:04:39.120> fat<00:04:39.590> did<00:04:40.590> well<00:04:40.800> in<00:04:40.919> the<00:04:41.010> Europe<00:04:41.310> was

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
playing Royal Decree with a mirror force

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.360 
playing Royal Decree with a mirror force
and<00:04:43.860> that<00:04:43.949> was<00:04:44.040> like<00:04:44.100> it<00:04:45.110> yeah<00:04:46.110> push<00:04:47.040> for<00:04:47.220> game

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
and that was like it yeah push for game

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.700 
and that was like it yeah push for game
over<00:04:47.790> their<00:04:47.910> tokens<00:04:48.510> and<00:04:48.690> it's<00:04:49.530> just

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
over their tokens and it's just

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.610 
over their tokens and it's just
devastating<00:04:49.830> against<00:04:50.580> them<00:04:50.729> the<00:04:51.470> because<00:04:52.470> one

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
devastating against them the because one

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.560 
devastating against them the because one
of<00:04:52.650> their<00:04:52.830> main<00:04:52.979> strategies<00:04:53.490> is<00:04:53.610> just<00:04:53.790> poking

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
of their main strategies is just poking

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.810 
of their main strategies is just poking
you<00:04:54.690> to<00:04:54.810> deck<00:04:55.020> while<00:04:55.800> poking<00:04:56.250> you<00:04:56.490> to<00:04:56.639> death

you to deck while poking you to death
while<00:04:57.030> you<00:04:57.240> can't<00:04:57.570> overcome<00:04:58.290> their<00:04:58.680> card

00:04:58.939 --> 00:04:58.949 
while you can't overcome their card

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:02.029 
while you can't overcome their card
advantage<00:04:59.389> like<00:05:00.389> they<00:05:00.690> keep<00:05:01.229> attacking<00:05:01.530> with

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:02.039 
advantage like they keep attacking with

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:03.860 
advantage like they keep attacking with
the<00:05:02.160> have<00:05:02.490> to<00:05:02.699> drill<00:05:02.940> warrior<00:05:03.270> over<00:05:03.720> your

the have to drill warrior over your
monsters<00:05:04.380> and<00:05:04.940> then<00:05:05.940> they<00:05:06.030> keep<00:05:06.180> getting

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
monsters and then they keep getting

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.510 
monsters and then they keep getting
tokens<00:05:06.810> so<00:05:06.930> you<00:05:07.020> can<00:05:07.139> ever<00:05:07.260> get<00:05:08.100> to<00:05:08.220> their<00:05:08.370> life

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
tokens so you can ever get to their life

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.930 
tokens so you can ever get to their life
points<00:05:08.880> directly<00:05:10.430> so<00:05:11.430> that's<00:05:11.610> how<00:05:11.729> they'll

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
points directly so that's how they'll

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.820 
points directly so that's how they'll
win<00:05:12.210> usually<00:05:12.570> just<00:05:12.840> kind<00:05:13.320> of<00:05:13.350> doing<00:05:13.470> that<00:05:13.590> work

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
win usually just kind of doing that work
