00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
the pan and you won't discrete one of

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.870 
the pan and you won't discrete one of
the<00:04:52.090> chicken<00:04:52.900> that<00:04:53.710> is<00:04:53.950> stuck<00:04:54.430> to<00:04:54.640> the<00:04:54.670> bottom

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
the chicken that is stuck to the bottom

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.270 
the chicken that is stuck to the bottom
of<00:04:55.210> the<00:04:55.300> pan<00:04:55.510> this<00:04:56.320> is<00:04:56.470> what<00:04:56.650> is<00:04:56.770> going<00:04:56.980> to<00:04:57.070> give

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
of the pan this is what is going to give

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.820 
of the pan this is what is going to give
your<00:04:57.370> gravy<00:04:57.670> the<00:04:57.940> flavor<00:04:58.500> so<00:04:59.500> once<00:04:59.650> your

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
your gravy the flavor so once your

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.590 
your gravy the flavor so once your
butter<00:04:59.920> is<00:05:00.160> melted<00:05:00.580> add<00:05:00.790> the<00:05:01.060> chicken<00:05:01.270> stock

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 
butter is melted add the chicken stock

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.770 
butter is melted add the chicken stock
to<00:05:01.750> this<00:05:01.980> and<00:05:03.750> scrape<00:05:04.750> the<00:05:05.050> bottom<00:05:05.440> of<00:05:05.710> the<00:05:05.800> pan

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
to this and scrape the bottom of the pan

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.890 
to this and scrape the bottom of the pan
to<00:05:07.780> get<00:05:07.930> all<00:05:08.170> of<00:05:08.290> the<00:05:08.410> flavor<00:05:08.680> out<00:05:08.980> of<00:05:09.160> the<00:05:09.900> pan

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
to get all of the flavor out of the pan

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.740 
to get all of the flavor out of the pan
from<00:05:11.260> the<00:05:11.410> chicken<00:05:11.740> that<00:05:11.860> we've<00:05:12.040> just<00:05:12.250> cooked

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
from the chicken that we've just cooked

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:21.870 
from the chicken that we've just cooked
and<00:05:13.750> bring<00:05:13.960> this<00:05:14.080> to<00:05:14.260> a<00:05:14.290> boil

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:21.880 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.159 

so<00:05:22.880> this<00:05:23.150> is<00:05:23.300> something<00:05:23.479> buoyant<00:05:23.900> for<00:05:24.020> about

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:24.169 
so this is something buoyant for about

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:25.810 
so this is something buoyant for about
two<00:05:24.380> to<00:05:24.530> three<00:05:24.560> minutes<00:05:25.009> and<00:05:25.220> I'm<00:05:25.430> now<00:05:25.610> going

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:25.820 
two to three minutes and I'm now going

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.510 
two to three minutes and I'm now going
to<00:05:25.940> add<00:05:26.090> the<00:05:26.240> onion<00:05:26.540> gravy<00:05:26.750> granules<00:05:27.710> and<00:05:27.949> the

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 
to add the onion gravy granules and the

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.029 
to add the onion gravy granules and the
chili<00:05:28.910> flakes<00:05:29.210> so<00:05:29.900> stir<00:05:30.169> this<00:05:30.350> in<00:05:30.500> really<00:05:30.889> well

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:31.039 
chili flakes so stir this in really well

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:34.480 
chili flakes so stir this in really well
and<00:05:31.630> carry<00:05:32.630> on<00:05:32.840> simmering<00:05:33.289> this<00:05:33.440> away<00:05:33.919> for

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
and carry on simmering this away for

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.270 
and carry on simmering this away for
another<00:05:34.639> two<00:05:34.910> to<00:05:35.030> three<00:05:35.060> minutes<00:05:35.509> and<00:05:36.280> what

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 
another two to three minutes and what

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.800 
another two to three minutes and what
you'll<00:05:37.400> find<00:05:37.430> sometimes<00:05:38.030> is<00:05:38.210> that<00:05:38.240> the<00:05:38.449> gravy

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:38.810 
you'll find sometimes is that the gravy

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.409 
you'll find sometimes is that the gravy
thickens<00:05:39.440> up<00:05:39.650> a<00:05:39.800> little<00:05:40.100> so<00:05:40.370> we're<00:05:41.180> not<00:05:41.300> gonna

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:41.419 
thickens up a little so we're not gonna

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:44.110 
thickens up a little so we're not gonna
add<00:05:41.539> my<00:05:41.780> cornflour<00:05:42.320> I'm<00:05:42.650> going<00:05:42.889> to<00:05:43.009> add<00:05:43.160> in<00:05:43.370> a

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 
add my cornflour I'm going to add in a

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.080 
add my cornflour I'm going to add in a
little<00:05:44.300> bit<00:05:44.600> of<00:05:44.810> extra<00:05:45.169> water<00:05:45.410> into<00:05:45.770> the<00:05:45.860> glass

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
little bit of extra water into the glass

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:51.629 
little bit of extra water into the glass
just<00:05:47.090> to<00:05:47.180> loosen<00:05:47.449> the<00:05:47.720> gravy<00:05:47.930> up<00:05:48.139> a<00:05:48.289> little<00:05:48.440> bit

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:51.639 

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:55.659 

so<00:05:52.639> this<00:05:53.419> has<00:05:53.600> now<00:05:53.720> been<00:05:53.919> sterile<00:05:54.919> simmering

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:55.669 
so this has now been sterile simmering

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:57.250 
so this has now been sterile simmering
away<00:05:55.760> for<00:05:55.910> about<00:05:56.330> two<00:05:56.539> to<00:05:56.660> three<00:05:56.810> minutes<00:05:57.110> and

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:57.260 
away for about two to three minutes and

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.770 
away for about two to three minutes and
I'm<00:05:57.380> just<00:05:57.620> adding<00:05:57.830> in<00:05:58.070> my<00:05:58.220> corn<00:05:58.460> flour<00:05:58.729> and<00:05:59.060> I

00:05:59.770 --> 00:05:59.780 
I'm just adding in my corn flour and I

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:01.650 
I'm just adding in my corn flour and I
added<00:06:00.020> in<00:06:00.289> some<00:06:00.530> extra<00:06:00.919> water<00:06:01.070> to<00:06:01.280> the<00:06:01.370> glass

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:01.660 
added in some extra water to the glass

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.750 
added in some extra water to the glass
so<00:06:02.660> just<00:06:03.110> mix<00:06:03.620> this<00:06:03.770> all<00:06:03.979> up<00:06:04.010> I<00:06:04.370> let<00:06:04.639> this

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:04.760 
so just mix this all up I let this

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.250 
so just mix this all up I let this
simmer<00:06:05.000> away<00:06:05.150> for<00:06:05.270> another<00:06:05.660> two<00:06:05.930> to<00:06:06.080> three

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:06.260 
simmer away for another two to three

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.330 
simmer away for another two to three
minutes<00:06:06.560> just<00:06:06.680> to<00:06:06.949> reduce<00:06:07.550> it<00:06:07.760> down<00:06:07.940> again<00:06:08.270> so

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:09.340 
minutes just to reduce it down again so

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:12.460 
minutes just to reduce it down again so
this<00:06:10.340> gravy<00:06:10.550> is<00:06:10.729> now<00:06:10.880> ready<00:06:11.120> I'm<00:06:11.900> going<00:06:12.320> to
