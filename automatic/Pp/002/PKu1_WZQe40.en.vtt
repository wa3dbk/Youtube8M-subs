back<00:00:26.970> here<00:00:27.300> we<00:00:27.449> should<00:00:27.599> probably<00:00:27.779> won't<00:00:27.990> be

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
back here we should probably won't be

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.769 
back here we should probably won't be
able<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.289> see<00:00:28.439> very<00:00:28.710> well<00:00:29.210> there's<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.269> splice<00:00:30.570> I

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
able to see very well there's a splice I

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:31.970 
able to see very well there's a splice I
guess<00:00:31.019> you<00:00:31.140> can't<00:00:31.349> see<00:00:31.500> it<00:00:31.590> pretty<00:00:31.769> well<00:00:31.859> the

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
guess you can't see it pretty well the

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.350 
guess you can't see it pretty well the
splicing<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.640> wire<00:00:32.880> all<00:00:33.840> that<00:00:34.290> is<00:00:34.500> is<00:00:34.739> just

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
splicing the wire all that is is just

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.000 
splicing the wire all that is is just
since<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:36.540> since<00:00:36.870> xboxes<00:00:37.559> do<00:00:37.710> have<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:37.950> a<00:00:40.010> very

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
since it since xboxes do have a a very

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.250 
since it since xboxes do have a a very
variable<00:00:41.670> fan<00:00:42.000> they<00:00:42.300> crank<00:00:42.600> I<00:00:42.750> guess<00:00:42.960> as<00:00:43.079> much

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
variable fan they crank I guess as much

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.600 
variable fan they crank I guess as much
as<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.829> kata<00:00:44.250> system<00:00:44.640> things<00:00:44.850> it<00:00:45.000> needs<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.480> I

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
as the kata system things it needs to I

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.670 
as the kata system things it needs to I
took<00:00:47.610> that<00:00:47.969> spliced<00:00:48.600> at<00:00:48.809> brown<00:00:49.110> wire<00:00:49.440> that's

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
took that spliced at brown wire that's

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.369 
took that spliced at brown wire that's
in<00:00:49.890> there<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.340> let<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.270> wire<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:52.050> can<00:00:52.199> see

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
in there and let a wire you can see

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.779 
in there and let a wire you can see
pieces<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.890> yellow<00:00:53.070> right<00:00:53.280> there<00:00:53.489> all<00:00:53.699> the

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
pieces of the yellow right there all the

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.569 
pieces of the yellow right there all the
way<00:00:53.960> to<00:00:54.960> anything<00:00:55.230> what<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.530> cd-rom<00:00:56.010> drive<00:00:56.340> is

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
way to anything what a cd-rom drive is

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.740 
way to anything what a cd-rom drive is
and<00:00:56.850> there's<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:58.579> nice<00:00:59.579> 12<00:00:59.969> volt<00:01:00.210> source<00:01:00.510> in

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
and there's a a nice 12 volt source in

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.119 
and there's a a nice 12 volt source in
there<00:01:00.870> that's<00:01:01.079> what<00:01:01.199> we<00:01:01.289> saw<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:01.559> or<00:01:01.710> two<00:01:01.890> and

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
there that's what we saw it or two and

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.890 
there that's what we saw it or two and
that<00:01:03.260> is<00:01:04.260> where<00:01:05.000> there<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:06.150> how<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.330> fan<00:01:06.659> keeps

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
that is where there is how the fan keeps

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.460 
that is where there is how the fan keeps
continuous<00:01:07.560> full<00:01:07.799> power<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.310> whole<00:01:08.430> time<00:01:08.670> and

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
continuous full power the whole time and

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.840 
continuous full power the whole time and
also<00:01:10.470> if<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:10.890> look<00:01:10.950> right<00:01:11.250> here<00:01:11.310> is<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.850> chrome

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
also if you look right here is a chrome

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
chrome air duct right there would be put

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.679 
chrome air duct right there would be put
in<00:01:16.439> also<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.850> final<00:01:18.000> thing<00:01:18.210> I<00:01:18.450> want<00:01:18.659> to

normally where your your power button

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.730 
normally where your your power button
hooked<00:01:26.400> up<00:01:26.689> but<00:01:27.689> what<00:01:27.900> we<00:01:28.020> did<00:01:28.200> was<00:01:28.380> we<00:01:28.409> change

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
okay you only saw the bottom two let's

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.410 
okay you only saw the bottom two let's
try<00:01:52.939> that<00:01:53.060> again

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.330 

make<00:01:59.049> it<00:01:59.170> look<00:01:59.290> like<00:01:59.500> it<00:01:59.619> actually<00:01:59.950> works<00:02:00.159> this

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
make it look like it actually works this

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.810 
make it look like it actually works this
time

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.760 

as<00:02:06.390> you<00:02:06.600> see<00:02:06.750> those<00:02:06.900> green<00:02:07.200> lights<00:02:07.409> are<00:02:07.620> now

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
as you see those green lights are now

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.700 
as you see those green lights are now
red<00:02:08.720> of<00:02:09.720> course<00:02:09.960> there's<00:02:10.140> no<00:02:10.259> lights<00:02:10.470> now

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
red of course there's no lights now

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.410 
red of course there's no lights now
because<00:02:11.130> there's<00:02:11.310> no<00:02:11.460> court<00:02:11.790> always<00:02:12.120> plugged

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
because there's no court always plugged

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.760 
because there's no court always plugged
in<00:02:12.830> but<00:02:13.830> if<00:02:13.920> you<00:02:13.980> look<00:02:14.130> up<00:02:14.310> top<00:02:14.550> here<00:02:15.590> you<00:02:16.590> see

in but if you look up top here you see
you<00:02:16.860> see<00:02:17.040> you<00:02:17.070> wrong<00:02:17.340> drives<00:02:17.640> spins<00:02:17.910> perfectly

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
you see you wrong drives spins perfectly

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.300 
you see you wrong drives spins perfectly
fine<00:02:18.600> and<00:02:18.870> operates<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:19.530> it<00:02:19.620> does<00:02:19.800> operate<00:02:20.190> on

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
fine and operates and it does operate on

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.030 
fine and operates and it does operate on
its<00:02:20.459> side<00:02:20.670> as<00:02:20.820> well
