all right this is a small room that we
have<00:00:05.430> in<00:00:05.609> the<00:00:05.700> studio<00:00:06.060> here<00:00:06.359> and<00:00:06.740> at<00:00:07.740> first<00:00:07.980> we

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
have in the studio here and at first we

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.240 
have in the studio here and at first we
used<00:00:08.250> it<00:00:08.610> for<00:00:09.500> people<00:00:10.500> who<00:00:10.650> are<00:00:10.800> getting<00:00:11.070> ready

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
used it for people who are getting ready

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.009 
used it for people who are getting ready
makeup<00:00:11.730> we<00:00:11.849> had<00:00:11.969> like<00:00:12.150> a<00:00:12.179> mirror<00:00:12.540> on<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:12.809> side

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
makeup we had like a mirror on the side

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.589 
makeup we had like a mirror on the side
here<00:00:13.849> but<00:00:14.849> we<00:00:14.940> just<00:00:15.059> kind<00:00:15.269> of<00:00:15.299> stripped

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
here but we just kind of stripped

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.080 
here but we just kind of stripped
everything<00:00:15.750> down<00:00:16.289> and<00:00:16.710> we're<00:00:17.580> going<00:00:17.699> to<00:00:17.820> start

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
everything down and we're going to start

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.200 
everything down and we're going to start
converting<00:00:18.750> this<00:00:19.170> into<00:00:19.740> a<00:00:20.070> room<00:00:20.910> where<00:00:21.119> we

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
converting this into a room where we

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.880 
converting this into a room where we
capture<00:00:21.570> some<00:00:21.720> audio<00:00:22.080> so<00:00:22.260> we<00:00:22.289> need<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.619> treat

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
capture some audio so we need to treat

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.019 
capture some audio so we need to treat
the<00:00:23.070> walls<00:00:23.510> right<00:00:24.510> now<00:00:25.430> I'm<00:00:26.430> sure<00:00:26.789> you<00:00:26.880> could

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
the walls right now I'm sure you could

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.269 
the walls right now I'm sure you could
hear<00:00:27.300> quite<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.080> bit<00:00:28.289> of<00:00:28.380> deflection<00:00:28.800> there's

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
hear quite a bit of deflection there's

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.030 
hear quite a bit of deflection there's
some<00:00:29.400> echo<00:00:29.730> in<00:00:29.880> here<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.710> we're<00:00:31.710> going<00:00:31.949> to

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
some echo in here and we're going to

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.030 
some echo in here and we're going to
treat<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.759> ceiling<00:00:33.180> with<00:00:33.420> some<00:00:33.690> some<00:00:34.590> more<00:00:34.770> LX

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
treat the ceiling with some some more LX

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.520 
treat the ceiling with some some more LX
wedges<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.820> then<00:00:36.630> we're<00:00:36.930> going<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.200> treat<00:00:37.350> the

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
wedges and then we're going to treat the

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.610 
wedges and then we're going to treat the
walls<00:00:37.770> with<00:00:38.219> some<00:00:38.570> audio<00:00:39.570> mutes<00:00:39.780> these<00:00:40.440> are

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
walls with some audio mutes these are

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.560 
walls with some audio mutes these are
some<00:00:40.829> sound<00:00:41.070> curtains<00:00:41.489> so<00:00:42.239> we'll<00:00:42.360> kind<00:00:42.540> of

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
some sound curtains so we'll kind of

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.619 
some sound curtains so we'll kind of
show<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:42.840> what<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.410> that<00:00:44.129> looks<00:00:44.370> like<00:00:44.629> then

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
show you what that that looks like then

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.319 
show you what that that looks like then
once<00:00:46.140> once<00:00:46.469> everything's<00:00:46.860> in<00:00:47.070> here<00:00:47.460> I'll<00:00:47.670> do

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
once once everything's in here I'll do

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.639 
once once everything's in here I'll do
another<00:00:48.510> sample<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:50.809> my<00:00:51.809> voice<00:00:52.020> in<00:00:52.320> here<00:00:52.469> right

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
another sample of my voice in here right

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.040 
another sample of my voice in here right
now<00:00:52.680> again<00:00:53.399> you<00:00:53.610> should<00:00:53.879> be<00:00:53.910> hearing<00:00:54.809> some

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
now again you should be hearing some

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.240 
now again you should be hearing some
echos<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:57.260> we'll<00:00:58.260> see<00:00:58.440> what<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.770> sounds<00:00:59.039> like

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
echos and we'll see what it sounds like

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.439 
echos and we'll see what it sounds like
after<00:01:00.079> the<00:01:01.079> sound<00:01:01.530> curtains<00:01:01.949> are<00:01:02.250> up<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.730> the

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
after the sound curtains are up and the

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.010 
after the sound curtains are up and the
aural<00:01:03.719> x<00:01:03.870> wedges<00:01:04.260> are<00:01:04.439> on<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.710> ceiling

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.990 

alright<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.200> first<00:01:10.439> stage<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.250> room<00:01:11.490> we

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
alright so first stage of the room we

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.380 
alright so first stage of the room we
have<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.360> Audi<00:01:12.869> mute<00:01:13.520> sound<00:01:14.520> curtains<00:01:15.090> on<00:01:15.330> the

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
have the Audi mute sound curtains on the

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.270 
have the Audi mute sound curtains on the
walls<00:01:16.729> going<00:01:17.729> down<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.150> floor<00:01:19.159> we're<00:01:20.159> also

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
walls going down to the floor we're also

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.499 
walls going down to the floor we're also
going<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.549> treat<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.790> floor<00:01:21.030> we're<00:01:21.360> also

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
going to treat the floor we're also

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.420 
going to treat the floor we're also
going<00:01:21.689> treat<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.020> ceiling<00:01:22.439> with<00:01:22.650> some<00:01:22.830> oral<00:01:23.280> x

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
going treat the ceiling with some oral x

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.600 
going treat the ceiling with some oral x
wedges<00:01:24.470> and<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:25.950> should<00:01:26.159> make<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.460> little

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
wedges and that should make it a little

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.550 
wedges and that should make it a little
bit<00:01:26.759> more<00:01:26.939> flat<00:01:27.180> in<00:01:27.390> here<00:01:28.250> so<00:01:29.250> it's<00:01:30.380> kind<00:01:31.380> of<00:01:31.470> a

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
bit more flat in here so it's kind of a

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:41.230 
bit more flat in here so it's kind of a
look<00:01:31.740> at<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:33.500> vocal<00:01:34.500> booth

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.540 

and<00:01:42.380> so<00:01:43.380> they'll<00:01:43.650> be<00:01:43.740> more<00:01:43.890> equipment<00:01:44.280> in<00:01:44.340> here

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
and so they'll be more equipment in here

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.710 
and so they'll be more equipment in here
to<00:01:44.700> come<00:01:44.940> show<00:01:45.480> you<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:45.690> in<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.840> second

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
to come show you that in a second

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.410 
to come show you that in a second
alright<00:01:48.720> so<00:01:49.080> a<00:01:49.380> little<00:01:49.860> bit<00:01:50.070> more<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:51.060> little

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
alright so a little bit more a little

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
alright so a little bit more a little
bit<00:01:51.450> more<00:01:51.690> stuff<00:01:51.870> here<00:01:51.930> you're<00:01:52.320> still

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 
bit more stuff here you're still

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.570 
bit more stuff here you're still
probably<00:01:52.800> hear<00:01:52.920> some<00:01:52.950> echo<00:01:53.220> because<00:01:53.400> we

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
probably hear some echo because we

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.190 
probably hear some echo because we
didn't<00:01:53.760> treat<00:01:53.970> all<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.510> walls<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.020> doors

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
didn't treat all the walls and the doors

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.450 
didn't treat all the walls and the doors
open<00:01:55.500> behind<00:01:55.740> me<00:01:55.890> but<00:01:56.900> we<00:01:57.900> built<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.440> kind<00:01:59.250> of<00:01:59.340> a

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
open behind me but we built a kind of a

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.340 
open behind me but we built a kind of a
reflection<00:02:00.000> filter<00:02:00.420> in<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.630> back<00:02:00.810> here<00:02:01.080> using

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
reflection filter in the back here using

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.520 
reflection filter in the back here using
some<00:02:01.380> Horlicks<00:02:01.920> wedges<00:02:02.720> that's<00:02:03.720> you<00:02:04.290> know<00:02:04.410> the

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
some Horlicks wedges that's you know the

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.220 
some Horlicks wedges that's you know the
decent<00:02:04.920> foam<00:02:05.100> not<00:02:05.550> the<00:02:05.700> cheap<00:02:05.880> stuff<00:02:06.140> we<00:02:07.140> have

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:07.230 
decent foam not the cheap stuff we have

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.310 
decent foam not the cheap stuff we have
a<00:02:07.260> road<00:02:07.740> procaster<00:02:08.190> microphone<00:02:08.880> here<00:02:09.320> and

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
a road procaster microphone here and

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.060 
a road procaster microphone here and
then<00:02:11.250> also<00:02:11.430> we<00:02:11.940> have<00:02:11.970> an<00:02:12.150> SE<00:02:12.510> reflection

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
then also we have an SE reflection

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.010 
then also we have an SE reflection
filter<00:02:14.070> here<00:02:14.430> this<00:02:14.850> is<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.150> more<00:02:15.840> expensive

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
filter here this is the more expensive

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.130 
filter here this is the more expensive
reflection<00:02:16.770> filter<00:02:17.420> supposedly<00:02:18.420> uses<00:02:18.810> seven

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
reflection filter supposedly uses seven

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.250 
reflection filter supposedly uses seven
layers<00:02:19.350> of<00:02:19.470> sound<00:02:20.459> absorption<00:02:21.240> type<00:02:21.990> stuff<00:02:22.230> so

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
layers of sound absorption type stuff so

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.070 
layers of sound absorption type stuff so
again<00:02:22.650> this<00:02:22.800> this<00:02:23.220> room<00:02:23.490> is<00:02:23.900> we're<00:02:24.900> just

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
again this this room is we're just

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.870 
again this this room is we're just
treating<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.530> room<00:02:25.830> to<00:02:26.220> better<00:02:26.640> the

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
treating the room to better the

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.300 
treating the room to better the
acoustics<00:02:27.510> but<00:02:28.260> this<00:02:28.410> is<00:02:28.530> not<00:02:28.709> a<00:02:28.740> sound

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
acoustics but this is not a sound

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.100 
acoustics but this is not a sound
isolation<00:02:30.090> room<00:02:30.240> this<00:02:30.390> is<00:02:30.480> not<00:02:30.600> like<00:02:30.720> a<00:02:30.750> sound

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
isolation room this is not like a sound

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.550 
isolation room this is not like a sound
booth<00:02:31.410> that<00:02:32.100> blocks<00:02:32.430> out<00:02:32.640> ambient<00:02:33.330> noise

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
booth that blocks out ambient noise

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.290 
booth that blocks out ambient noise
we're<00:02:34.560> just<00:02:34.830> adding<00:02:35.070> stuff<00:02:35.490> in<00:02:35.640> here<00:02:35.820> to<00:02:35.970> treat

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
we're just adding stuff in here to treat

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.030 
we're just adding stuff in here to treat
the<00:02:36.540> room<00:02:36.780> so<00:02:37.050> that<00:02:37.200> our<00:02:37.320> acoustic<00:02:37.590> sound

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
the room so that our acoustic sound

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.500 
the room so that our acoustic sound
better<00:02:38.220> because<00:02:38.459> the<00:02:38.580> room<00:02:38.790> is<00:02:38.940> so<00:02:39.180> small<00:02:41.510> so

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
better because the room is so small so

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.030 
better because the room is so small so
like<00:02:42.780> right<00:02:42.990> here<00:02:43.260> you<00:02:43.290> can<00:02:43.470> probably<00:02:43.590> hear<00:02:43.890> an

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
like right here you can probably hear an

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.240 
like right here you can probably hear an
echo<00:02:44.370> but<00:02:44.610> as<00:02:44.790> I<00:02:44.940> move<00:02:45.150> closer<00:02:45.480> into<00:02:46.250> the

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
echo but as I move closer into the

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.550 
echo but as I move closer into the
corner<00:02:47.580> here<00:02:47.820> hopefully<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:48.840> audio<00:02:49.110> sounds<00:02:49.500> a

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
corner here hopefully the audio sounds a

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.470 
corner here hopefully the audio sounds a
little<00:02:49.650> bit<00:02:49.860> more<00:02:50.010> flat<00:02:50.250> again<00:02:51.180> I<00:02:51.209> didn't

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
little bit more flat again I didn't

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.610 
little bit more flat again I didn't
really<00:02:51.510> close<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:52.350> door<00:02:52.500> behind<00:02:52.650> me<00:02:54.350> and<00:02:55.350> also

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
really close the door behind me and also

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.370 
really close the door behind me and also
adding<00:02:56.070> furniture<00:02:56.940> will<00:02:57.300> even<00:02:57.570> kind<00:02:58.290> of

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
adding furniture will even kind of

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.050 
adding furniture will even kind of
deaden<00:02:58.769> some<00:02:58.980> of<00:02:59.070> that<00:02:59.160> sound<00:02:59.400> so<00:02:59.820> we<00:02:59.940> have

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
deaden some of that sound so we have

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.190 
deaden some of that sound so we have
some<00:03:00.209> other<00:03:00.269> furniture<00:03:00.750> coming<00:03:00.930> in<00:03:01.080> here

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
some other furniture coming in here

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.500 
some other furniture coming in here
because<00:03:01.410> this<00:03:01.500> is<00:03:01.650> where<00:03:01.830> our<00:03:02.510> talent

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
because this is where our talent

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.259 
because this is where our talent
actually<00:03:03.900> gets<00:03:04.560> ready<00:03:04.920> before<00:03:05.640> we<00:03:05.790> shoot<00:03:06.030> as

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
actually gets ready before we shoot as

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.039 
actually gets ready before we shoot as
well<00:03:06.570> so<00:03:07.489> oh<00:03:08.489> yeah<00:03:09.360> and<00:03:09.480> we<00:03:09.630> haven't<00:03:09.989> even

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
well so oh yeah and we haven't even

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.380 
well so oh yeah and we haven't even
treated<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:10.620> the<00:03:10.920> ceiling<00:03:11.310> it<00:03:11.459> with<00:03:12.090> some<00:03:12.269> of

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
treated the the ceiling it with some of

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.620 
treated the the ceiling it with some of
our<00:03:12.480> wedges<00:03:12.900> so<00:03:13.830> a<00:03:14.310> lot<00:03:14.459> more<00:03:14.489> stuff<00:03:14.850> happening

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
our wedges so a lot more stuff happening

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.229 
our wedges so a lot more stuff happening
but<00:03:15.840> hopefully<00:03:16.830> you<00:03:17.760> know<00:03:17.850> you<00:03:17.880> guys<00:03:18.060> could

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
but hopefully you know you guys could

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.870 
but hopefully you know you guys could
take<00:03:18.360> a<00:03:18.390> look<00:03:18.600> at<00:03:19.640> something<00:03:20.640> that<00:03:20.760> we're

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
take a look at something that we're

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.410 
take a look at something that we're
working<00:03:21.000> on<00:03:22.730> all<00:03:23.730> right<00:03:23.850> so<00:03:23.970> we<00:03:24.060> got<00:03:24.180> some<00:03:24.299> of

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
working on all right so we got some of

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.280 
working on all right so we got some of
the<00:03:24.540> wedges<00:03:25.140> on<00:03:25.440> the<00:03:25.560> ceiling<00:03:26.220> here<00:03:27.290> then

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
the wedges on the ceiling here then

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.610 
the wedges on the ceiling here then
we've<00:03:28.440> got<00:03:28.620> the<00:03:30.290> you<00:03:31.290> know<00:03:31.380> a<00:03:31.410> little

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
we've got the you know a little

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.170 
we've got the you know a little
reflection<00:03:31.860> filter<00:03:32.430> over<00:03:32.670> here<00:03:32.880> we've<00:03:33.120> got

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
reflection filter over here we've got

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.630 
reflection filter over here we've got
the<00:03:33.570> audio<00:03:34.230> mutes<00:03:34.440> on<00:03:34.650> the<00:03:34.830> walls<00:03:35.070> which<00:03:35.489> are

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
the audio mutes on the walls which are

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.229 
the audio mutes on the walls which are
the<00:03:35.790> kind<00:03:36.269> of<00:03:36.360> sound<00:03:36.600> curtains<00:03:36.989> and<00:03:38.239> so

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
the kind of sound curtains and so

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.479 
the kind of sound curtains and so
hopefully<00:03:39.620> it<00:03:40.620> sounds<00:03:40.890> a<00:03:40.950> little<00:03:41.040> more<00:03:41.190> flat

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
hopefully it sounds a little more flat

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.490 
hopefully it sounds a little more flat
in<00:03:41.640> here<00:03:41.910> I'm<00:03:42.750> on<00:03:42.959> a<00:03:43.019> point<00:03:43.290> and<00:03:43.380> shoot<00:03:43.410> camera

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
in here I'm on a point and shoot camera

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.960 
in here I'm on a point and shoot camera
so<00:03:43.920> obviously<00:03:44.220> it's<00:03:44.370> not<00:03:44.459> gonna<00:03:44.580> sound<00:03:44.730> very

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
so obviously it's not gonna sound very

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.699 
so obviously it's not gonna sound very
well<00:03:45.150> but<00:03:45.330> hopefully<00:03:45.870> you<00:03:46.260> guys<00:03:46.500> hear<00:03:46.680> a

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
well but hopefully you guys hear a

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.949 
well but hopefully you guys hear a
difference<00:03:47.190> between<00:03:47.700> what<00:03:48.599> it'll<00:03:48.690> look<00:03:48.750> like

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
difference between what it'll look like

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.059 
difference between what it'll look like
earlier<00:03:49.319> and<00:03:49.530> what<00:03:49.650> it<00:03:49.740> looks<00:03:49.920> like<00:03:50.099> now

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:55.880 

I'm<00:03:54.060> sure<00:03:54.299> you<00:03:54.390> could<00:03:54.540> hear<00:03:54.810> quite<00:03:55.530> a<00:03:55.560> bit<00:03:55.799> of

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
I'm sure you could hear quite a bit of

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.209 
I'm sure you could hear quite a bit of
deflection<00:03:56.310> there's<00:03:56.790> some<00:03:56.909> echo<00:03:57.239> in<00:03:57.389> here<00:03:57.659> and

00:03:58.209 --> 00:03:58.219 
deflection there's some echo in here and

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:00.920 
deflection there's some echo in here and
we're<00:03:59.219> going<00:03:59.459> to<00:03:59.549> treat<00:04:00.120> the<00:04:00.269> ceiling<00:04:00.689> with

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
we're going to treat the ceiling with

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.149 
we're going to treat the ceiling with
some<00:04:01.170> some<00:04:02.099> more<00:04:02.280> LX<00:04:02.549> wedges<00:04:03.799> the<00:04:04.799> room<00:04:04.980> is

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:05.159 
some some more LX wedges the room is

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:07.369 
some some more LX wedges the room is
still<00:04:05.370> not<00:04:05.519> done<00:04:05.790> we<00:04:06.030> have<00:04:06.209> two<00:04:06.810> more<00:04:06.959> curtains

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.379 
still not done we have two more curtains

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:10.369 
still not done we have two more curtains
to<00:04:07.560> put<00:04:07.739> up<00:04:07.889> and<00:04:08.310> we<00:04:08.790> need<00:04:08.939> to<00:04:09.030> treat<00:04:09.269> more<00:04:10.230> of

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:10.379 
to put up and we need to treat more of

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:14.089 
to put up and we need to treat more of
the<00:04:10.609> flooring<00:04:11.639> I<00:04:12.379> think<00:04:13.379> the<00:04:13.469> ceilings<00:04:13.889> going

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 
the flooring I think the ceilings going

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:16.759 
the flooring I think the ceilings going
to<00:04:14.159> do<00:04:14.280> fine<00:04:14.519> for<00:04:14.549> now<00:04:15.199> there<00:04:16.199> was<00:04:16.380> a<00:04:16.410> little

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
to do fine for now there was a little

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.879 
to do fine for now there was a little
deflection<00:04:17.489> earlier<00:04:18.180> and<00:04:18.449> then<00:04:18.959> once<00:04:19.620> we<00:04:19.769> got

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
deflection earlier and then once we got

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:22.370 
deflection earlier and then once we got
the<00:04:20.039> ceiling<00:04:20.430> parts<00:04:20.729> up<00:04:21.019> that<00:04:22.019> really
