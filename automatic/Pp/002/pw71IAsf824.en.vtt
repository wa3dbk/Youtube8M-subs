00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
line we'll just do the tail line first

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.000 
line we'll just do the tail line first
and<00:02:13.000> then<00:02:14.000> as<00:02:14.360> it<00:02:14.990> gets<00:02:15.110> to<00:02:15.290> the<00:02:15.470> outer<00:02:15.650> edge

just a little bit heavier so just a

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.949 
just a little bit heavier so just a
little<00:02:18.739> bit<00:02:18.860> further<00:02:19.190> down<00:02:19.540> into<00:02:20.540> the<00:02:20.750> lash

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
little bit further down into the lash

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.300 
little bit further down into the lash
line<00:02:22.989> you<00:02:23.989> can<00:02:24.170> even<00:02:24.319> get<00:02:24.560> that<00:02:24.770> effect<00:02:24.890> this

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
line you can even get that effect this

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.190 
line you can even get that effect this
by<00:02:25.489> going<00:02:25.790> back<00:02:26.000> and<00:02:26.209> forth<00:02:26.450> in<00:02:26.630> the<00:02:26.750> tear<00:02:26.989> line

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
by going back and forth in the tear line

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.850 
by going back and forth in the tear line
and<00:02:27.410> just<00:02:27.530> letting<00:02:27.770> it<00:02:27.980> kind<00:02:28.190> of<00:02:29.500> kind<00:02:30.500> of<00:02:30.590> rub

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
and just letting it kind of kind of rub

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.820 
and just letting it kind of kind of rub
on<00:02:31.010> the<00:02:31.520> lash<00:02:31.940> line<00:02:31.970> then<00:02:32.720> you<00:02:32.870> can<00:02:33.140> get<00:02:33.769> a

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
on the lash line then you can get a

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.060 
on the lash line then you can get a
pretty<00:02:34.220> straight<00:02:34.700> line<00:02:35.830> sometimes<00:02:36.830> when<00:02:36.980> you

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
pretty straight line sometimes when you

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.740 
pretty straight line sometimes when you
just<00:02:37.100> try<00:02:37.370> to<00:02:37.489> make<00:02:37.760> a<00:02:37.790> line<00:02:38.060> under<00:02:38.450> the<00:02:38.570> lap

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
just try to make a line under the lap

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.210 
just try to make a line under the lap
when<00:02:39.110> you<00:02:39.200> don't<00:02:39.380> have<00:02:39.470> that<00:02:39.530> tear<00:02:39.920> line<00:02:40.070> to

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220
