 years 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.280
 he finished his doctorate in biology 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.599
 Engineering at Federal Polytechnic School 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.440
 from lausanne 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:19.310
 epfl but continues on its campus where 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.689
 founded a statue that is no longer 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.150
 I hate cafeteria. I remember that. 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.130
 I was at a coffee shop with a surgeon partner. 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.820
 the company and my thesis supervisor 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:33.180
 when we decided to pitch I did not say 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:36.300
 that ct lanna drumond in a laboratory 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.210
 special of epfl mercanzini develop 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.250
 a thinner microelectrode film of the 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.989
 that a hair that can be 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.969
 implanted in the brain for a 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:50.100
 stimulation reads full steam and 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:52.530
 this beak entered the skull and when 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.920
 arrives at his destination he releases it 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.680
 Grandma brought the only way Brotero 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.440
 the results are incredible in the hospital 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.750
 insel in the device is tested 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.280
 in patients with Parkinson's disease 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.350
 when surgeon sends and pulse 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.350
 electric the patient stops trembling 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:20.790
 the beans the rice from the air show before the 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.790
 the patient was incapacitated 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.380
 after surgery thanks to the implant 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.479
 Brain is doing very well. 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.190
 those who invested 14 million 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.229
 Franks in startup are also 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.649
 satisfied 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:37.899
 I ride in the UN after signing the 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:43.270
 contract took some videos up 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:44.520
 realize that it was not dirty and badly 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.720
 Parkinson's disease and dementia 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.000
 depression and other dependence 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.369
 psychiatric disorders located in the 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.320
 can all be treated with 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:02:00.220
 brain implant a huge market 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:02:02.740
 potential package to the crisis they 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.899
 brain activity modulated by signals 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.450
 is the golden novel 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:10.179
 What is missing is an accurate map of the 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.850
 brain and the areas to be targeted 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.100
 for each pathology disease and if 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.320
 refusing a more accurate mapping of the 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.660
 functions is one of the main 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.090
 objectives of the white river project 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.489
 project funded by the european union 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.640
 if we put electrodes in the wrong part 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:30.310
 of the brain instead of blocking the tremor 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.799
 of patients with Parkinson 's disease can 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.230
 serious depression in him or her. 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:36.940
 despite decades of experience the 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.739
 teacher to welcome the head of 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.049
 neurology of the university hospital of 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:43.239
 lausanne knows how difficult to understand the 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:45.730
 human brain is missing diagnosis 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.829
 Melz even opted for the best hospitals 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.799
 the world when a patient is 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:54.310
 diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:03:00.130
 40% of the cases the diagnosis is wrong 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:02.170
 almost half the Rio Grande project aims to 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:10.989
 reduce this type of error and other 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:13.420
 startups may still shock today 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.640
 member project I think the project will 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.010
 create a huge information base 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.920
 on which new technology can 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:23.920
 I'm not going to build it. 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:28.569
 technology, then other companies will be 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:31.090
 created using just want to also passing 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.739
 without doubt and not only in Lausanne but 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.200
 also around other universities 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:38.849
 that are part of the project is that 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:42.099
 participates in the cup can access this 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:44.940
 would be a new valley of the brain as it is 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:44.940
 silicon in california 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:51.549
 you can even it is no exaggeration 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.690
 if we put the years together and 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:58.209
 we still have to renove lyon is immense 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.280
 the man's arrival on the moon is nothing 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.950
 compared to the voice of the science of 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.940
 information and technology we are 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.940
 experimenting now
