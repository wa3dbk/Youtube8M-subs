through the wheel and have to fit you
will<00:01:03.420> also<00:01:03.600> need<00:01:04.080> roughly<00:01:04.770> 5<00:01:05.280> bearings

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:05.910 
will also need roughly 5 bearings

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.610 
will also need roughly 5 bearings

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:12.230 
to be alright let's get some okay first

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:19.900 
to be alright let's get some okay first
just<00:01:13.230> get<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.800> wheel<00:01:14.120> place<00:01:15.120> it<00:01:15.420> inside<00:01:15.690> the

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:19.910 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:25.660 

fork<00:01:21.290> then<00:01:22.290> put<00:01:23.010> the<00:01:23.310> ball<00:01:23.910> through<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.930> Fox

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
fork then put the ball through the Fox

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:31.490 
fork then put the ball through the Fox
second<00:01:26.670> put<00:01:27.480> all<00:01:27.690> the<00:01:27.930> bearings<00:01:28.400> put<00:01:29.400> it<00:01:30.500> onto

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
second put all the bearings put it onto

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.140 
second put all the bearings put it onto
the<00:01:31.830> end<00:01:31.950> of<00:01:32.160> the<00:01:32.310> line<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.790> end<00:01:33.000> of<00:01:33.090> the

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
the end of the line to the end of the

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.480 
the end of the line to the end of the
ball<00:01:35.150> but<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.210> need<00:01:36.480> to<00:01:36.690> remember<00:01:37.490> the

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
ball but you need to remember the

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.960 
ball but you need to remember the
bearings<00:01:38.940> have<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.450> cover<00:01:39.780> up<00:01:40.550> until<00:01:41.550> it<00:01:41.700> gets

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
bearings have to cover up until it gets

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.570 
bearings have to cover up until it gets
to<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.600> bit<00:01:43.020> where<00:01:43.230> you<00:01:43.350> screw<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.830> on<00:01:43.950> because

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
to the bit where you screw it on because

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.220 
to the bit where you screw it on because
if<00:01:44.730> it's<00:01:44.910> too<00:01:45.120> far<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:45.720> can't<00:01:45.930> screw<00:01:46.200> it

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:46.230 
if it's too far and you can't screw it

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.510 
if it's too far and you can't screw it
on<00:01:46.410> it'll<00:01:46.890> be<00:01:46.920> very<00:01:47.220> loose<00:01:47.540> so<00:01:48.540> keep<00:01:49.140> putting

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
on it'll be very loose so keep putting

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.640 
on it'll be very loose so keep putting
bearings<00:01:50.520> on<00:01:52.790> now<00:01:53.790> what's<00:01:54.120> wrong<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:55.350> can

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
bearings on now what's wrong you can

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.470 
bearings on now what's wrong you can
juice<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.520> abbeys<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:56.970> more<00:01:57.210> or<00:01:57.330> less

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:57.480 
juice the abbeys and more or less

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.330 
juice the abbeys and more or less
bearings<00:01:57.930> depends<00:01:58.350> on<00:01:58.440> tell<00:01:58.920> them<00:01:59.070> you<00:01:59.190> want

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
bearings depends on tell them you want

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.690 
bearings depends on tell them you want
to<00:01:59.370> stomp<00:01:59.640> it<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.880> bit<00:02:00.150> then<00:02:00.690> you<00:02:00.900> get<00:02:01.050> your<00:02:01.200> nut

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
to stomp it a bit then you get your nut

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.190 
twist twist make sure it's not too loose
otherwise<00:02:57.030> it<00:02:57.240> wobbles<00:02:57.660> and<00:02:57.750> make<00:02:57.900> sure<00:02:58.050> it's

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
otherwise it wobbles and make sure it's

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.350 
otherwise it wobbles and make sure it's
not<00:02:58.350> too<00:02:58.590> tight<00:02:58.620> otherwise<00:02:59.040> then<00:02:59.670> you<00:03:00.150> will

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
not too tight otherwise then you will

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.700 
not too tight otherwise then you will
want<00:03:00.600> some<00:03:00.840> free<00:03:01.080> Lana<00:03:01.700> so<00:03:03.170> to<00:03:04.170> make<00:03:04.350> it<00:03:04.470> tight

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
want some free Lana so to make it tight

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.530 
want some free Lana so to make it tight
enough<00:03:04.920> just<00:03:05.340> check<00:03:05.640> up<00:03:05.790> it<00:03:05.910> spins<00:03:06.240> in<00:03:06.480> the

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
enough just check up it spins in the

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.230 
enough just check up it spins in the
middle<00:03:06.750> so<00:03:07.620> under<00:03:08.160> no<00:03:08.340> loosen<00:03:08.820> up<00:03:08.940> overtime

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
middle so under no loosen up overtime

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.520 
middle so under no loosen up overtime
good<00:03:09.740> then<00:03:10.740> if<00:03:11.190> your<00:03:11.490> fault<00:03:11.850> is<00:03:12.030> treadline<00:03:12.720> you

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
good then if your fault is treadline you

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.370 
good then if your fault is treadline you
basically<00:03:14.400> just<00:03:14.550> saw<00:03:15.270> the<00:03:15.330> other<00:03:15.720> part<00:03:16.110> off

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
basically just saw the other part off

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.750 
basically just saw the other part off
here<00:03:16.760> or<00:03:17.760> just<00:03:18.420> get<00:03:18.630> a<00:03:18.660> smaller<00:03:19.350> smaller<00:03:20.340> bolt

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
here or just get a smaller smaller bolt

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.140 
here or just get a smaller smaller bolt
so<00:03:21.390> you've<00:03:21.720> got<00:03:21.990> a<00:03:22.230> working<00:03:22.920> home<00:03:23.400> aged<00:03:23.640> omberg

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
a nice shot bearings are too rusty

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.670 
a nice shot bearings are too rusty
because<00:03:26.790> then<00:03:27.060> it<00:03:27.180> won't<00:03:27.300> spin<00:03:27.720> like<00:03:28.110> it<00:03:28.470> won't

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
because then it won't spin like it won't

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.490 
because then it won't spin like it won't
