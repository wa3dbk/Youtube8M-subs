00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 hello I'm going to explain the 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.960
 operation of the pools 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.400
 you find it difficult as you can 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.349
 see here there are some columns of 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.139
 combinations and people the truth is 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.210
 that messes up a bit to start saying 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.110
 what is a legend this that playing 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.540
 those who are reduced do not get anything from 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.850
 you will never touch a 14 or 15 this is not 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:25.040
 true this is not true since all 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.290
 these combinations here are worth that 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.910
 now that we will now see 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.610
 well imagine we played the seven 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:35.180
 doubles worth we make a normal betting 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:37.040
 here you see it gets double vale 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.930
 then here a pool where they point 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.450
 the doubles and the triples in this case 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:45.530
 we've played seven doubles and in this 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:48.140
 column here you have to tap those 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:52.290
 squares that we play doubles we have 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:54.240
 seven doubles we mark seven squares 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.480
 suppose we have guessed right 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.300
 forecast 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.340
 ok we have the 14 results in the 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:05.659
 base pool and we have to do the 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:09.740
 reduction is worth as you will see here there are some 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:14.570
 columns with 1 and x1 means the 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:16.370
 first sign and x the second sign 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.740
 so for example we see here the 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:21.470
 first box has come out a 1 we have 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.580
 to come here and cross out the x that the 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:27.730
 first row 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.440
 second box if one comes out we have a 12 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.420
 let's say that the team of 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.570
 outside as it is the second if it has not 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.570
 right 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:40.400
 we'll keep the X's worth and so 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.010
 until we have a whole column 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.210
 empty that in this case for example 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:47.860
 after playing two doubles we are left 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.860
 four columns worth 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.890
 ok we can go making the reduction 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:59.070
 everything and we see that we have combined a 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.260
 of the columns 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.260
 ok then we start looking at what 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:07.200
 we have in this column here as 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.149
 We all have a 14 successes 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.000
 as long as we have all successful 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.730
 the fixed ones obviously worth we have a 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.840
 of 14 because it has no failure 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.790
 From here we start counting the 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.980
 rest of columns the first column 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.810
 we have one two three failures then 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:26.220
 we will have one of 11 and so on 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:28.350
 we are telling you all the columns and 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.959
 then we write down what we have if we play 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.660
 7 double in this case with this line 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:36.830
 we would have obtained one of 14 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:41.700
 none of 13 none of 12 11 of 7 and 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:43.490
 forgiveness 7 of 11 and 7 of 10 is worth this 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.310
 quiniela 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:49.910
 eight euros if it is double to direct 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.980
 worth 64 euros I advise playing this 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:56.840
 type of pools you have 10% of 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:03:00.100
 probability of hitting 14 if you have 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.100
 the 14 on the line the base 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:07.299
 what else can I tell you 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.700
 this pool for example reduced to 13 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:13.930
 couple you always make sure that if you have 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:16.209
 one of 14 in the base pool always 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.859
 you're going to have at least one of 13 here in 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.450
 this case we have combined that of 14 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:21.359
 that's why we have not combined that of 13 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.739
 when combined now 14 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:25.180
 normally 13 are no longer combined 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:28.109
 rare that in this case we have 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:31.629
 combined one of 12 but it's good 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:33.400
 here for example we have different 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:35.379
 reductions four triples if 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.169
 we would like to play this four triples 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:40.359
 it is very easy to make a one betting 

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:43.030
 with four triples we put four here 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:44.739
 triples we mark the triples here and if 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.859
 we would be playing these combinations 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.569
 from here if we want to play three triples and 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:53.230
 three doubles because this combination of 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:55.659
 here it is very easy and the clippers is 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.700
 very easy if a 1 goes out the 1 if the 

00:03:55.659 --> 00:04:01.550
 Equis Equis is and if it is 2 2 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:03.320
 it's much easier to play doubles 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.840
 what else can I tell you is also 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.760
 possible to put more doubles for example in 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.250
 this one has seven doubles is you 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.370
 you can play nine doubles but you have 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:16.370
 that reduce seven worth we would play nine 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:19.489
 doubles here here we mark nine doubles 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:22.190
 instead of seven and here we mark the 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:24.460
 seven doubles that we're going to reduce from 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:27.310
 among the nine we would have played 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:32.169
 then the prizes here would be what 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:34.419
 same but playing two direct doubles 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:36.189
 It is then worth to know the prizes already 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:38.860
 we would have come for example here 

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:40.870
 we would have one of 14 with two doubles 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.550
 then where have you come to this 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.760
 type of pool to look here the two 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.670
 doubles that supposes is very easy 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:51.460
 in this here or the administration 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:56.070
 because it is there is the 13 it ensures you 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:56.070
 awards of 13 of 13 of 13 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:02.350
 this is also 13 and then they're 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:05.260
 these two here that is 8 triples that 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:07.330
 worth 40 euros and a half that is reduced to 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.370
 12 when you hit the 14 clicks away 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:12.610
 minimum prizes of 12 the differences 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:16.060
 you are only 1% correct 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:19.090
 a pool of 14 but they combine and they 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:21.100
 combine and here we have a little bit already 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.620
 beast would not burn a little they are 11 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:26.370
 double to 12 Â° and do the reduction of 11 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:29.410
 doubles is also a bit a bit heavy 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:31.060
 it's good, I do not expect anything 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:34.560
 it became clear how this works 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.560
 reduced and luck
