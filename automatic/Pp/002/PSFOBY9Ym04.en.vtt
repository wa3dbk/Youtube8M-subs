instruction manuals are down there so so

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.630 
instruction manuals are down there so so
let's<00:01:59.990> take<00:02:00.200> a<00:02:00.229> closer<00:02:00.590> look<00:02:00.710> at<00:02:00.920> the<00:02:00.979> watch

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.279 

okay<00:02:04.640> so<00:02:04.700> this<00:02:04.909> is<00:02:05.090> the<00:02:05.210> watch<00:02:05.359> up<00:02:05.600> close<00:02:05.869> and

about the area around where you can see
the<00:02:18.050> display<00:02:18.410> but<00:02:18.620> the<00:02:18.739> actual<00:02:19.010> LCD<00:02:19.640> panel<00:02:20.390> as

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
the display but the actual LCD panel as

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.630 
the display but the actual LCD panel as
well<00:02:20.540> is<00:02:20.959> a<00:02:21.319> mirror<00:02:21.769> finish<00:02:22.040> so<00:02:22.310> that's<00:02:22.489> quite

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
well is a mirror finish so that's quite

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.030 
well is a mirror finish so that's quite
unique<00:02:22.730> I<00:02:23.510> don't<00:02:23.870> believe<00:02:24.260> I<00:02:24.530> know<00:02:24.620> of<00:02:24.890> any

unique I don't believe I know of any

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.030 
unique I don't believe I know of any
other<00:02:25.160> g-shock<00:02:25.970> watch<00:02:26.209> that<00:02:26.569> has<00:02:26.810> that<00:02:27.110> so

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
other g-shock watch that has that so

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.339 
other g-shock watch that has that so
it's<00:02:28.190> a<00:02:28.310> mirror<00:02:28.550> finish<00:02:28.760> and<00:02:29.239> then<00:02:29.360> the<00:02:30.110> time

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
it's a mirror finish and then the time

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:33.040 
it's a mirror finish and then the time
is<00:02:30.620> displayed<00:02:31.099> in<00:02:31.550> black<00:02:31.940> let's<00:02:32.660> take<00:02:32.870> a<00:02:32.900> look

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
is displayed in black let's take a look

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.199 
is displayed in black let's take a look
at<00:02:33.170> the<00:02:33.230> backlight<00:02:33.680> as<00:02:34.099> you<00:02:34.849> can<00:02:34.940> see<00:02:35.090> the

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
at the backlight as you can see the

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:41.860 
at the backlight as you can see the
backlight<00:02:35.599> is<00:02:35.750> blue<00:02:40.209> pretty<00:02:41.209> nice<00:02:41.390> backlight

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
backlight is blue pretty nice backlight

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.440 
backlight is blue pretty nice backlight
and<00:02:41.989> then<00:02:42.769> the<00:02:42.950> band<00:02:43.190> of<00:02:43.459> it<00:02:43.610> is<00:02:43.819> sort<00:02:44.239> of<00:02:44.299> this

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
and then the band of it is sort of this

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.620 
and then the band of it is sort of this
metallic<00:02:44.989> gray<00:02:45.470> or<00:02:45.799> metallic<00:02:46.310> silver<00:02:46.640> type

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
metallic gray or metallic silver type

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.160 
metallic gray or metallic silver type
look<00:02:48.910> it's<00:02:49.910> got<00:02:50.030> a<00:02:50.090> distinctive<00:02:50.750> look<00:02:50.780> to<00:02:51.049> it

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
look it's got a distinctive look to it

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.550 
look it's got a distinctive look to it
and<00:02:52.329> again<00:02:53.329> this<00:02:53.420> is<00:02:53.569> a<00:02:53.599> limited<00:02:54.049> edition<00:02:54.170> wash

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
and again this is a limited edition wash

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.710 
and again this is a limited edition wash
only<00:02:54.980> a<00:02:55.130> certain<00:02:55.610> limited<00:02:56.060> number<00:02:56.569> of<00:02:56.599> these

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
only a certain limited number of these

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.339 
only a certain limited number of these
were<00:02:57.019> produced<00:02:57.440> so<00:02:58.360> they're<00:02:59.360> a<00:02:59.390> bit<00:02:59.599> rare<00:03:00.110> and

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:00.349 
were produced so they're a bit rare and

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:05.050 
were produced so they're a bit rare and
hard<00:03:00.500> to<00:03:00.560> find<00:03:01.630> and<00:03:03.280> as<00:03:04.280> time<00:03:04.579> goes<00:03:04.760> on<00:03:04.849> I<00:03:04.910> think

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
hard to find and as time goes on I think

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.130 
hard to find and as time goes on I think
they're<00:03:05.209> going<00:03:05.299> to<00:03:05.360> be<00:03:05.450> even<00:03:05.630> harder<00:03:05.780> to<00:03:05.989> find

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
they're going to be even harder to find

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.830 
they're going to be even harder to find
because<00:03:06.590> of<00:03:06.829> the<00:03:07.549> fact<00:03:07.849> that<00:03:07.970> only<00:03:08.269> certain

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
because of the fact that only certain

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.930 
because of the fact that only certain
certain<00:03:09.410> numbers<00:03:09.680> of<00:03:09.739> these<00:03:09.920> were<00:03:10.099> actually

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
certain numbers of these were actually

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.720 
certain numbers of these were actually
produced<00:03:11.709> but<00:03:12.709> i<00:03:12.769> think<00:03:12.980> this<00:03:13.099> watch<00:03:13.310> came<00:03:13.579> out

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
produced but i think this watch came out

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.150 
produced but i think this watch came out
home<00:03:13.880> only<00:03:14.120> about<00:03:14.560> three<00:03:15.560> or<00:03:15.620> four<00:03:15.709> months<00:03:15.980> ago

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
home only about three or four months ago

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.220 
home only about three or four months ago
back<00:03:16.370> in<00:03:16.400> i<00:03:16.790> believe<00:03:17.239> it<00:03:17.630> was<00:03:17.720> march<00:03:18.019> two

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
back in i believe it was march two

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.390 
back in i believe it was march two
thousand<00:03:18.560> eleven<00:03:20.769> other<00:03:21.769> than<00:03:21.980> that<00:03:22.130> it's

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
thousand eleven other than that it's

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.629 
thousand eleven other than that it's
pretty<00:03:22.489> much<00:03:22.819> you<00:03:23.120> know<00:03:23.209> your<00:03:23.389> standard

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.720 
flash alert where you can turn that on
by<00:03:57.139> holding<00:03:57.470> this<00:03:57.590> down<00:03:57.829> and<00:03:58.099> then<00:03:58.489> every<00:03:58.700> time

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
by holding this down and then every time

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.250 
by holding this down and then every time
the<00:03:59.000> alarm<00:03:59.209> goes<00:03:59.359> off<00:03:59.450> it<00:03:59.630> would<00:03:59.750> also<00:03:59.870> flash

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
the alarm goes off it would also flash

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.569 
the alarm goes off it would also flash
the<00:04:00.470> backlight<00:04:01.480> this<00:04:02.480> is<00:04:02.630> the<00:04:02.780> 1289<00:04:03.590> module<00:04:04.220> so

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:04.579 
the backlight this is the 1289 module so

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:07.300 
the backlight this is the 1289 module so
it's<00:04:05.150> good<00:04:05.359> up<00:04:05.569> to<00:04:05.810> i<00:04:05.840> believe<00:04:06.170> the<00:04:06.530> year<00:04:06.769> the

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
it's good up to i believe the year the

that<00:06:03.539> so<00:06:04.139> that's<00:06:04.650> something<00:06:04.830> to<00:06:04.949> be<00:06:05.159> aware<00:06:05.190> of

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:05.430 
that so that's something to be aware of

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.219 
that so that's something to be aware of
but<00:06:05.699> it's<00:06:06.150> a<00:06:06.240> different<00:06:06.360> kind<00:06:06.569> of<00:06:06.690> watch<00:06:06.840> also

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:07.229 
but it's a different kind of watch also

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:09.140 
but it's a different kind of watch also
in<00:06:07.379> that<00:06:07.560> I<00:06:07.770> think<00:06:08.279> the<00:06:08.400> face<00:06:08.550> of<00:06:08.580> it<00:06:08.789> is<00:06:08.909> a<00:06:08.969> lot

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.150 
in that I think the face of it is a lot

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.480 
in that I think the face of it is a lot

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:11.490 
more elegant if you can notice if they
