00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:19.090
 small tips very simple but that 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.860
 they will be very useful for three 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.660
 that are starting or all that are 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.580

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.590

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.450

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.489
 sincere apology for not being up 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.529
 the videos constantly what happens 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:35.380
 I've had a lot of work and I have not 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.180
 had a chance to do this because the 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.230
 I also like it, but then 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.780
 I will be constantly climbing 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:46.030
 videos comes out here these little tips 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:49.210
 well I present the racc that I use is 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.700
 a simple vrac let's say modest but 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.650
 that at the same time will help us 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.690
 help protect our teams a lot 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.910
 our devices, our 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.350
 crossover equalizer amplifiers and 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.850
 all the all kinds of devices that 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.680
 we want to keep there always 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.780
 procure if you are going to make a rack try 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.970
 leave a good space so you do not 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.220
 have problems with the buttons and that 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.110
 You can move it easily without damaging 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.329
 same other advice that I can give you is 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.460
 that you allow ventilation or that 

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:17.289
 haiga space between amplifier can 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.149
 recommend you leave three spaces 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:20.409
 so you can accommodate your devices and 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:22.840
 have a good dissipation 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:25.090
 of heat between them and that the heat does not 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.340
 damage your devices I also advise you 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.710
 that you put some good wheels better 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.750
 something good that lasts and not something cheap that 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.420
 you have to be changing every time and 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.009
 the truth my respect for these wheels 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.469
 that come out very good try to protect 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:40.959
 your devices with a lid and that this 

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:42.819
 same stage does not get to damage or hit him 

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:44.979
 to the buttons the equalizers and 

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:46.990
 crossover your devices are very 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:50.109
 fragile other advice that I can give you 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.719
 is that in the back no tapes 

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:54.879
 in its entirety or put fans 

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:57.250
 at the same time it's always good to have 

00:01:54.879 --> 00:01:59.020
 good air circulation a good 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.239
 dissipation helps a lot that your 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.520
 appliances last a lot and do not 

00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:05.619
 overheating you can stop it from this 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.170
 way then it would be great for 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:10.269
 have a good circulation of air 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.299
 and do not overheat in your 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:16.060
 appliances and do not have headaches 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:18.250
 during the event 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.260
