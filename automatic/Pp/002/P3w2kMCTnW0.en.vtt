00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.959
 always mobile word congress guide we are 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.580
 along with asus bergamaschi and we have 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:20.189
 already seen the zen fondue is anyway 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.720
 presented at the ces of las vegas e 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.800
 we want to focus however 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.270
 on the interface the new zen he left 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.439
 to tell you all about us 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.809
 auto graphical interface functions 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.000
 gladly then at the ces of las vegas 

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:34.050
 has presented the zen phone due though 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.280
 the new interface was not yet 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.660
 ultimately 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.280
 now that the product will arrive later 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.600
 Italy the first week from the second 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.070
 week of April 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.840
 we already have a final version of the 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.880
 aunt and our graphic interface that 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.490
 animate our phones that I make you 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.560
 see substantially here the phone is 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.880
 equipped with the flic cover what 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.060
 I would like to show you already initially 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.649
 to the clip cover that has a whole series 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.390
 of features that recall me 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.399
 the main weather applications 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.440
 rather than even the camera 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.480
 where I could go to take pictures 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.850
 without having to open the flip then this 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.390
 I am a very interesting thing 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.360
 other important things la zai why e 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.340
 how to say an application that covers all 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.659
 the functionality of the device 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.520
 holding on the screen I can 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.200
 go and personalize your zai something 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.510
 which very often cannot be done 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.590
 why many builders animate the 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.370
 phone with its own interface 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.190
 graphics 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.840
 that and I can't tell you to make it 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.250
 my staff in this case I can 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.680
 changing icons can change them 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.200
 scrolling effects can change the 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.369
 font colors so I'm going to create 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.130
 tried an interface that i 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.450
 therefore represents maybe folder that 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.920
 let's say folders where I go to 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.390
 put applications 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.680
 I can customize them not only 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.930
 changing the name but also changing 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.659
 just the aesthetic part we have most 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.990
 a whole series of gestures we have the 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.270
 classic start up then to revive 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.549
 the telephone rather than the possibility 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.360
 to call an application then a 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.630
 screen off 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.820
 I'm going to do say the initial letter 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.009
 application and this is opened 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.380
 there are many other effects there is the 2 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.450
 trayter there is a kind of reminder that 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.430
 allows me to postpone things that 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.620
 I can't make a call 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.989
 just do the sheikh in the 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.510
 call is called archived for 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.280
 a next callback rather than if 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.290
 someone calls me enough can 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.060
 place your hand under the phone on 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.319
 phone 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.330
 therefore it no longer disturbs the 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:28.370
 phone call remains active these are 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.640
 some of the features we say of the 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.620
 zai why there are many because we say 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.599
 that the interesting aspect of the new 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.720
 wave and then we updated it 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:40.970
 continually usually what happens yes 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.870
 update the device with the firmware 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.610
 full 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.050
 we instead update all the 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.239
 individual applications that characterize 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.099
 the zagni why then the end user will have 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.989
 always the maximum experience with respect to 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:51.319
 what is the use of the telephone 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.630
 same 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.459
 then a user experience that becomes 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.080
 personalized but also tends to 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.019
 simplify fast to speed up 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.549
 some actions absolutely comes to me 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:03.500
 while two other applications we have the 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:06.560
 kit mode then the possibility of being able 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.390
 have the phone used by you 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.220
 grandchildren or children often happens that many 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.140
 let's say children take the phone to 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.430
 play and then the phone is not known in 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.440
 what conditions come back then 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.269
 I send an e-mail to the boss who does not why 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.440
 he wouldn't be home to send her then 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.170
 this gives me the opportunity to have 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.940
 how to say a safe and limited environment 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.440
 for children and we will also have the 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.450
 possibility of comeback on an antivirus 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.579
 that protects me from any let's say 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.260
 malicious software as they are defined 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:33.320
 another interesting thing is the possibility 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.420
 to unlock the phone in two ways 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.310
 one we call the standard mode that is 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.590
 the one that allows me to use the 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.540
 full phone and one a mode 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.160
 limited where I go only to activate 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.260
 certain applications this can 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.880
 be used forever for i 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.650
 children rather than to try the 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.930
 phone to a friend of mine without it going 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.000
 maybe to open special software or 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.380
 as often happens with whatsapp i 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.450
 social classics where everything comes 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.590
 hence limit a bit the two environment 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.120
 your privacy is also maintained 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.950
 in short, on which applications 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.660
 correct to close zen fondue e 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.000
 therefore available in more cuts 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.380
 we remember when it will be available ea 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.569
 what prices 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.579
 then the cut will be 5 inches or 5 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:12.980
 inches and a half available from 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:14.299
 second week of April the price is 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.889
 we will announce a little later, however, there 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:17.959
 I can say that compared to what we have 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:19.789
 told vegas 190 dollars 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.650
 $ 199 for the basic version 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:23.660
 therefore we maintain if we do the right 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.220
 proportions we can account for 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.380
 where we want to get the idea of 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.210
 bring luxury within everyone's reach 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.190
 then a high device 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.249
 performance with a series also of 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.599
 accessories 

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:35.459
 maybe sold separately that 

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:37.039
 but they make it special to me 

00:04:35.459 --> 00:04:41.509
 at a price that is certainly appealing 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:41.509
 thank you so much john greek thanks to you
