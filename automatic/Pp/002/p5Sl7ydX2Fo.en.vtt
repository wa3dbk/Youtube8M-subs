is actually relatively low-budget
British<00:00:17.039> film<00:00:17.310> but<00:00:17.820> it<00:00:17.910> does<00:00:18.119> have<00:00:18.330> some<00:00:18.600> quite

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
British film but it does have some quite

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.439 
British film but it does have some quite
high<00:00:19.609> expectations<00:00:20.609> that<00:00:20.760> what<00:00:21.029> it's<00:00:21.210> trying

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
high expectations that what it's trying

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.019 
high expectations that what it's trying
to<00:00:21.539> do<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:22.080> it's<00:00:22.859> essentially<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.580> found

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
to do and it's essentially a found

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.509 
to do and it's essentially a found
footage<00:00:24.180> movie<00:00:24.990> but<00:00:25.410> with<00:00:25.560> Dinosaurs<00:00:26.189> so<00:00:26.400> it's

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519

kind<00:00:26.699> of<00:00:26.760> a<00:00:26.789> really<00:00:27.000> bit<00:00:27.150> of<00:00:27.240> a<00:00:27.390> unique<00:00:28.050> twist

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
kind of a really bit of a unique twist

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
on the found footage formula but it does

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.530 
on the found footage formula but it does
have<00:00:31.410> obviously<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:32.550> fair<00:00:33.000> man<00:00:33.210> offers<00:00:33.450> a

and<00:00:52.770> they<00:00:52.860> said<00:00:53.090> unwittingly<00:00:54.090> managed<00:00:54.449> to

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
and they said unwittingly managed to

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.959 
and they said unwittingly managed to
sort<00:00:54.750> of<00:00:54.809> stumble<00:00:55.199> across<00:00:55.260> this<00:00:55.680> is<00:00:56.309> an<00:00:56.550> area

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
sort of stumble across this is an area

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.910 
sort of stumble across this is an area
where<00:00:57.120> this<00:00:57.270> with<00:00:57.539> venture<00:00:58.199> is<00:00:58.469> untouched

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
where this with venture is untouched

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.209 
where this with venture is untouched
he's<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.219> this<00:00:59.309> living<00:00:59.489> dinosaurs<00:01:00.180> there<00:01:00.420> and

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 
he's and this living dinosaurs there and

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:03.950 
he's and this living dinosaurs there and
ultimately<00:01:02.219> you<00:01:03.059> know<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.270> numbers<00:01:03.570> gates<00:01:03.780> of

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
ultimately you know the numbers gates of

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.080 
ultimately you know the numbers gates of
sitting<00:01:04.680> down<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:04.920> no<00:01:05.369> crew<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.700> locals<00:01:06.030> are

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
sitting down and no crew the locals are

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.429 
sitting down and no crew the locals are
saying<00:01:06.360> oh<00:01:06.479> you<00:01:06.540> know<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:06.840> shouldn't<00:01:07.200> care<00:01:07.350> in

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
saying oh you know you shouldn't care in

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:08.840 
saying oh you know you shouldn't care in
this<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.560> very<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.159> what-have-you<00:01:08.640> and

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
this a very and what-have-you and

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.840 
this a very and what-have-you and
ultimately<00:01:09.659> it<00:01:09.750> becomes<00:01:10.229> an<00:01:10.439> adventure

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
ultimately it becomes an adventure

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.710 
ultimately it becomes an adventure
eventually<00:01:11.850> maybe<00:01:11.939> really<00:01:12.240> just<00:01:12.479> trying<00:01:12.659> to

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
eventually maybe really just trying to

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.570 
eventually maybe really just trying to
escape<00:01:13.140> this<00:01:13.260> kind<00:01:13.500> of<00:01:13.560> this<00:01:13.680> particular<00:01:14.340> area

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
escape this kind of this particular area

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.760 
escape this kind of this particular area
as<00:01:15.299> I<00:01:15.570> sort<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.320> darkness<00:01:16.530> will

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
as I sort of the darkness will

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.160 
as I sort of the darkness will
ultimately<00:01:17.250> so<00:01:17.490> probably<00:01:17.759> taking<00:01:18.210> out<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.689> case

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
ultimately so probably taking out a case

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.810 
ultimately so probably taking out a case
of<00:01:19.409> crew<00:01:20.070> along<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.820> way<00:01:21.890> now<00:01:22.890> this<00:01:23.640> is

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
of crew along the way now this is

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.580 
of crew along the way now this is
obviously<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.210> low-budget<00:01:24.570> movie<00:01:24.750> so<00:01:25.259> and

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
obviously a low-budget movie so and

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.350 
obviously a low-budget movie so and
being<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.890> found<00:01:26.130> footage<00:01:26.220> film<00:01:26.729> you're<00:01:27.090> never

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
being a found footage film you're never

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.520 
being a found footage film you're never
going<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.570> get<00:01:27.689> this<00:01:27.750> kind<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:27.990> lingering

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
going to get this kind of lingering

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.469 
going to get this kind of lingering
shots<00:01:28.979> of<00:01:29.189> obviously<00:01:29.460> dinosaurs<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.240> things

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
shots of obviously dinosaurs and things

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.359 
shots of obviously dinosaurs and things
like<00:01:30.630> that<00:01:30.869> that<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:31.439> do<00:01:31.710> in<00:01:31.860> say<00:01:32.040> something

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
like that that you do in say something

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.039 
like that that you do in say something
movies<00:01:32.759> like<00:01:32.880> Jurassic<00:01:33.210> Park<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:33.780> things<00:01:33.930> of

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
movies like Jurassic Park and things of

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.960 
movies like Jurassic Park and things of
that<00:01:34.079> nevertheless<00:01:34.710> I<00:01:35.040> have<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.430> say<00:01:35.640> I

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
that nevertheless I have to say I

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.789 
that nevertheless I have to say I
actually<00:01:36.630> didn't<00:01:37.020> think<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.290> effects<00:01:37.619> were

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
actually didn't think the effects were

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.859 
actually didn't think the effects were
all<00:01:38.009> that<00:01:38.220> bad<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.490> I<00:01:38.850> could<00:01:39.000> quite<00:01:39.360> enjoy<00:01:39.689> and

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
all that bad and I could quite enjoy and

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.359 
all that bad and I could quite enjoy and
if<00:01:39.930> you've<00:01:40.079> seen<00:01:40.110> things<00:01:40.500> like<00:01:40.680> Walking<00:01:41.340> with

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
if you've seen things like Walking with

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.289 
if you've seen things like Walking with
Dinosaurs

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
Dinosaurs

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.030 
Dinosaurs
that'll<00:01:42.689> kind<00:01:42.930> of<00:01:42.960> give<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.229> an<00:01:43.350> idea<00:01:43.470> what<00:01:43.890> to

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
that'll kind of give you an idea what to

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.830 
that'll kind of give you an idea what to
expect<00:01:44.070> there<00:01:44.820> is<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:45.000> reasonable<00:01:45.540> amount<00:01:45.600> of

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
expect there is a reasonable amount of

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.020 
expect there is a reasonable amount of
sort<00:01:46.079> of<00:01:46.140> dinosaurs<00:01:46.649> but<00:01:47.220> you'll<00:01:47.369> kind<00:01:47.579> of<00:01:47.640> you

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
sort of dinosaurs but you'll kind of you

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.569 
sort of dinosaurs but you'll kind of you
know<00:01:48.149> see<00:01:48.750> on<00:01:48.899> show<00:01:49.140> here<00:01:49.409> being<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.340> found

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
know see on show here being a found

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.160 
know see on show here being a found
footage<00:01:50.790> from<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.060> lot<00:01:51.360> of<00:01:51.420> these<00:01:51.479> films<00:01:51.720> barely

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
footage from a lot of these films barely

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.020 
footage from a lot of these films barely
show<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:52.380> anything<00:01:52.890> but<00:01:53.070> like<00:01:53.670> I<00:01:53.790> said<00:01:53.850> this

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
show you anything but like I said this

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.550 
show you anything but like I said this
is<00:01:54.180> what<00:01:54.329> I'm<00:01:54.540> quite<00:01:54.780> surprised<00:01:55.170> this<00:01:55.380> mean

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
is what I'm quite surprised this mean

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.859 
is what I'm quite surprised this mean
because<00:01:55.799> obviously<00:01:55.920> it<00:01:56.219> does<00:01:56.399> have<00:01:56.750> in<00:01:57.750> a

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
because obviously it does have in a

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.990 
because obviously it does have in a
reasonable<00:01:58.350> amount<00:01:58.380> of<00:01:58.619> special-effects<00:01:59.280> the

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
reasonable amount of special-effects the

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.149 
reasonable amount of special-effects the
young<00:02:00.210> boil<00:02:00.509> most<00:02:00.780> of<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.110> befriends<00:02:01.979> this

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
young boil most of the befriends this

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.789 
young boil most of the befriends this
kind<00:02:02.399> of<00:02:02.960> this<00:02:03.960> kind<00:02:04.110> of<00:02:04.170> this<00:02:04.530> little

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
kind of this kind of this little

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.499 
kind of this kind of this little
dinosaur<00:02:05.340> all<00:02:05.460> -<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:05.790> they<00:02:05.850> kind<00:02:06.090> of<00:02:06.180> they

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
dinosaur all - and they kind of they

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:07.819 
dinosaur all - and they kind of they
kind<00:02:06.719> of<00:02:06.780> bond<00:02:06.990> which<00:02:07.140> may<00:02:07.290> be<00:02:07.350> a<00:02:07.500> little<00:02:07.619> bit

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
kind of bond which may be a little bit

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.320 
kind of bond which may be a little bit
silly<00:02:08.039> but<00:02:08.220> nevertheless<00:02:08.459> that's<00:02:09.119> what

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
silly but nevertheless that's what

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.839 
silly but nevertheless that's what
happens<00:02:09.720> and<00:02:09.959> probably<00:02:10.590> relatively<00:02:11.129> expected

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
happens and probably relatively expected

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.309 
happens and probably relatively expected
one<00:02:12.180> of<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.330> things<00:02:12.480> I<00:02:12.569> didn't<00:02:12.870> really<00:02:13.020> like

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
one of the things I didn't really like

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.410 
one of the things I didn't really like
this<00:02:14.159> kind<00:02:14.459> of<00:02:14.719> has<00:02:15.719> very<00:02:16.049> sort<00:02:16.319> of<00:02:16.439> obvious

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
this kind of has very sort of obvious

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.160 
this kind of has very sort of obvious
foreshadowing<00:02:18.420> of<00:02:18.540> that<00:02:18.719> things<00:02:18.959> that's

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
foreshadowing of that things that's

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.989 
foreshadowing of that things that's
going<00:02:19.290> to<00:02:19.379> happen<00:02:19.560> and<00:02:19.920> you<00:02:20.370> know<00:02:20.489> there's<00:02:20.939> a

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:20.999 
going to happen and you know there's a

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:23.479 
going to happen and you know there's a
guy<00:02:21.150> who's<00:02:21.510> in<00:02:21.719> the<00:02:21.870> mood<00:02:22.829> in<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.010> set<00:02:23.189> of<00:02:23.280> the

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
guy who's in the mood in the set of the

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.160 
guy who's in the mood in the set of the
crew<00:02:23.670> these<00:02:23.849> people<00:02:24.239> who<00:02:24.359> obviously<00:02:24.629> going<00:02:25.109> to

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
crew these people who obviously going to

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.379 
crew these people who obviously going to
betray<00:02:25.439> them<00:02:25.650> as<00:02:25.769> someone<00:02:26.010> who<00:02:26.340> just<00:02:26.389> the

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:27.389 
betray them as someone who just the

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:29.780 
betray them as someone who just the
cameras<00:02:27.749> focused<00:02:28.530> on<00:02:28.650> him<00:02:28.829> sort<00:02:29.040> of<00:02:29.069> like<00:02:29.280> in

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
cameras focused on him sort of like in

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.539 
cameras focused on him sort of like in
agram<00:02:30.150> a<00:02:30.269> Cygnus<00:02:30.719> he's<00:02:31.189> not<00:02:32.189> giving<00:02:32.489> the

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
agram a Cygnus he's not giving the

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:34.640 
agram a Cygnus he's not giving the
recognition<00:02:33.180> for<00:02:33.359> example<00:02:33.450> all<00:02:34.139> of<00:02:34.170> the<00:02:34.469> work

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
recognition for example all of the work

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:35.959 
recognition for example all of the work
that<00:02:34.799> he's<00:02:34.889> done<00:02:35.040> usually<00:02:35.250> while<00:02:35.579> that<00:02:35.760> guy<00:02:35.909> is

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:35.969 
that he's done usually while that guy is

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:38.780 
that he's done usually while that guy is
going<00:02:36.239> to<00:02:36.329> be<00:02:36.480> some<00:02:36.989> kind<00:02:37.139> of<00:02:37.260> asshole<00:02:37.549> at<00:02:38.549> some

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
going to be some kind of asshole at some

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.459 
going to be some kind of asshole at some
point<00:02:39.030> then<00:02:39.209> I<00:02:39.419> mean<00:02:39.540> it<00:02:39.599> just<00:02:39.659> didn't<00:02:40.349> need<00:02:40.409> to

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:40.469 
point then I mean it just didn't need to

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:42.379 
point then I mean it just didn't need to
do<00:02:40.650> that<00:02:40.799> ultimately<00:02:41.310> it<00:02:41.730> didn't<00:02:42.000> come<00:02:42.180> as<00:02:42.269> any

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:42.389 
do that ultimately it didn't come as any

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:44.360 
do that ultimately it didn't come as any
surprise<00:02:42.480> when<00:02:43.109> that<00:02:43.139> obviously<00:02:43.680> happens<00:02:44.189> and

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
surprise when that obviously happens and

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.809 
surprise when that obviously happens and
things<00:02:44.489> aren't<00:02:44.760> that<00:02:45.290> the<00:02:46.290> acting<00:02:46.709> is<00:02:47.430> also<00:02:47.790> a

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
things aren't that the acting is also a

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.940 
things aren't that the acting is also a
little<00:02:47.969> bit<00:02:48.090> choppy<00:02:48.480> in<00:02:49.169> time<00:02:49.409> but<00:02:49.620> I<00:02:49.680> had<00:02:49.829> to

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
little bit choppy in time but I had to

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.420 
little bit choppy in time but I had to
say<00:02:50.629> sample<00:02:51.629> use<00:02:51.750> films<00:02:52.109> difficult<00:02:53.099> to<00:02:53.189> judge

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
say sample use films difficult to judge

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.179 
say sample use films difficult to judge
in<00:02:53.669> the<00:02:53.989> sun-god<00:02:54.989> to<00:02:55.260> writing<00:02:55.439> I<00:02:55.650> think<00:02:55.829> but<00:02:56.010> I

00:02:56.179 --> 00:02:56.189 
in the sun-god to writing I think but I

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:58.550 
in the sun-god to writing I think but I
have<00:02:56.939> to<00:02:57.030> say<00:02:57.180> some<00:02:57.359> of<00:02:57.449> the<00:02:57.510> acting<00:02:57.840> wasn't

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
have to say some of the acting wasn't

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.369 
have to say some of the acting wasn't
fantastic<00:02:59.269> not<00:03:00.269> terrible<00:03:00.870> I<00:03:00.930> have<00:03:01.139> seen

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
fantastic not terrible I have seen

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:03.110 
fantastic not terrible I have seen
certainly<00:03:01.709> worse<00:03:01.949> but<00:03:02.340> you<00:03:02.639> know<00:03:02.730> if<00:03:02.969> you

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
certainly worse but you know if you

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.429 
certainly worse but you know if you
watch<00:03:03.359> this<00:03:03.540> whenever<00:03:03.719> you<00:03:03.840> kind<00:03:04.049> of<00:03:04.079> get<00:03:04.230> this

00:03:04.429 --> 00:03:04.439 
watch this whenever you kind of get this

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:07.159 
watch this whenever you kind of get this
sense<00:03:04.650> of<00:03:04.739> what<00:03:04.889> I<00:03:04.919> mean<00:03:05.129> by<00:03:05.189> that<00:03:05.930> but<00:03:06.930> they

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:07.169 
sense of what I mean by that but they

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:08.330 
sense of what I mean by that but they
said<00:03:07.319> the<00:03:07.439> effects<00:03:07.769> only<00:03:07.889> think<00:03:08.129> with<00:03:08.219> two

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
said the effects only think with two

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.030 
said the effects only think with two
bags<00:03:08.609> yes<00:03:09.120> they<00:03:09.329> are<00:03:09.359> computer-generated<00:03:10.040> yes

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
bags yes they are computer-generated yes

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.530 
bags yes they are computer-generated yes
you<00:03:11.609> can<00:03:11.790> probably<00:03:12.000> tell<00:03:12.269> that<00:03:12.389> they're

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
you can probably tell that they're

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.360 
you can probably tell that they're
computer-generated<00:03:13.199> but<00:03:13.739> you<00:03:13.859> know<00:03:13.980> I<00:03:14.189> think

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
computer-generated but you know I think

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.280 
computer-generated but you know I think
it<00:03:14.669> was<00:03:14.790> so<00:03:15.000> you<00:03:15.060> have<00:03:15.209> to<00:03:15.329> go<00:03:15.449> in<00:03:15.599> a<00:03:15.900> low-budget

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
it was so you have to go in a low-budget

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.319 
it was so you have to go in a low-budget
movie<00:03:16.469> with<00:03:16.769> certain<00:03:17.040> expectations<00:03:17.790> and<00:03:18.000> I

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
movie with certain expectations and I

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:21.679 
movie with certain expectations and I
quite<00:03:18.569> enjoyed<00:03:18.900> it<00:03:19.079> for<00:03:19.319> that<00:03:20.329> so<00:03:21.329> no<00:03:21.659> I

00:03:21.679 --> 00:03:21.689 
quite enjoyed it for that so no I

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:23.149 
quite enjoyed it for that so no I
actually<00:03:21.959> thought<00:03:22.229> I<00:03:22.379> thought<00:03:22.500> was<00:03:22.650> an<00:03:22.859> okay

00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:23.159 
actually thought I thought was an okay

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:24.890 
actually thought I thought was an okay
movie<00:03:23.189> certainly<00:03:23.939> certainly<00:03:24.359> worth<00:03:24.509> a<00:03:24.689> watch

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
movie certainly certainly worth a watch
