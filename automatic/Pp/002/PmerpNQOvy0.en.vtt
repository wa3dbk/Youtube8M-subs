00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
of this knife a few years ago and it

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.230 
of this knife a few years ago and it
came<00:00:21.090> back<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.449> me<00:00:21.480> for<00:00:21.810> a<00:00:21.840> spa<00:00:22.140> treatment<00:00:23.240> it's

came back to me for a spa treatment it's

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.630 
came back to me for a spa treatment it's
been<00:00:24.660> fine<00:00:25.050> you<00:00:25.650> know<00:00:25.740> everything's<00:00:26.160> work<00:00:26.430> the

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
been fine you know everything's work the

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.290 
been fine you know everything's work the
edge<00:00:26.789> is<00:00:27.000> still<00:00:27.180> really<00:00:27.539> good<00:00:29.179> you<00:00:30.179> know<00:00:30.269> a

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
edge is still really good you know a

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.620 
edge is still really good you know a
couple<00:00:30.510> of<00:00:30.660> years<00:00:30.840> of<00:00:30.990> use<00:00:31.230> yeah<00:00:31.890> it's<00:00:32.070> shaving

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:32.630 
couple of years of use yeah it's shaving

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.049 
couple of years of use yeah it's shaving
so<00:00:33.630> there's<00:00:34.050> still<00:00:34.320> shapes<00:00:35.130> with<00:00:35.370> difficulty

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
so there's still shapes with difficulty

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.950 
so there's still shapes with difficulty
but<00:00:36.270> it's<00:00:36.390> still<00:00:36.630> okay<00:00:38.360> guys<00:00:39.360> been<00:00:39.600> using<00:00:39.809> it

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
but it's still okay guys been using it

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.979 
but it's still okay guys been using it
for<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.170> couple<00:00:40.200> years<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:41.719> one<00:00:42.719> thing<00:00:42.960> that

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
for a couple years and one thing that

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.930 
for a couple years and one thing that
happened<00:00:43.620> over<00:00:43.890> those<00:00:44.010> couple<00:00:44.430> years<00:00:44.670> is

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
happened over those couple years is

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.440 
happened over those couple years is
right<00:00:45.210> here<00:00:45.629> where<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.200> scale<00:00:46.680> meets<00:00:46.950> the

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
right here where the scale meets the

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.020 
right here where the scale meets the
tang<00:00:48.680> some<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.829> epoxy<00:00:50.219> came<00:00:50.579> out<00:00:50.760> of<00:00:50.879> there

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
tang some of the epoxy came out of there

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.670 
tang some of the epoxy came out of there
so<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.329> wondered<00:00:51.780> what<00:00:51.960> I<00:00:51.989> could<00:00:52.050> do<00:00:52.350> for<00:00:52.530> that

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
so you wondered what I could do for that

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.160 
so you wondered what I could do for that
and<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:52.860> said<00:00:52.920> well<00:00:53.160> why<00:00:53.340> don't<00:00:53.370> I<00:00:53.579> just<00:00:54.170> replace

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
and I said well why don't I just replace

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.650 
and I said well why don't I just replace
the<00:00:55.379> scales<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.160> give<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:56.940> like<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.149> little<00:00:57.300> spa

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
the scales and give it like a little spa

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.319 
the scales and give it like a little spa
treatment<00:00:58.140> so<00:00:58.260> I'm<00:00:58.350> gonna<00:00:58.500> do<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:59.329> the

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
treatment so I'm gonna do that the

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.229 
treatment so I'm gonna do that the
problem<00:01:00.510> is<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:01.050> that<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.440> tang<00:01:01.739> in<00:01:02.250> this<00:01:02.879> area

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
problem is is that the tang in this area

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.140 
problem is is that the tang in this area
is<00:01:03.780> thinner<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.650> kind<00:01:04.890> of<00:01:04.979> jumps<00:01:05.880> out<00:01:06.119> of

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
is thinner and it kind of jumps out of

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.490 
is thinner and it kind of jumps out of
the<00:01:06.299> word<00:01:06.710> juts<00:01:07.710> out<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.100> way<00:01:08.250> there<00:01:08.520> and

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
the word juts out of the way there and

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.960 
the word juts out of the way there and
at<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.740> time<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:11.100> didn't<00:01:11.310> have<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.460> brand<00:01:11.790> of

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
at the time I didn't have a brand of

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.120 
at the time I didn't have a brand of
powerful<00:01:12.450> enough<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.750> grind<00:01:13.140> that<00:01:13.380> flap<00:01:13.799> and

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
powerful enough to grind that flap and

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.890 
powerful enough to grind that flap and
so<00:01:14.310> I<00:01:14.340> just<00:01:14.580> filled<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:14.909> with<00:01:14.939> epoxy<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.570> then

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
so I just filled it with epoxy and then

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.440 
so I just filled it with epoxy and then
foxy<00:01:16.259> came<00:01:16.439> out<00:01:16.650> but<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.640> handle<00:01:17.970> scales<00:01:18.210> are

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
foxy came out but the handle scales are

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.249 
foxy came out but the handle scales are
just<00:01:18.630> fine<00:01:18.900> these<00:01:19.619> these<00:01:20.549> pins<00:01:20.939> I<00:01:21.259> they're

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
just fine these these pins I they're

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.310 
just fine these these pins I they're
basically<00:01:22.830> brass<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.790> then<00:01:24.060> I<00:01:24.320> countersunk

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
basically brass and then I countersunk

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.590 
basically brass and then I countersunk
and<00:01:26.070> then<00:01:26.220> hammered<00:01:26.670> them<00:01:26.850> into<00:01:27.509> the

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
and then hammered them into the

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.060 
and then hammered them into the
countersink<00:01:28.170> so<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:28.590> they're<00:01:28.740> flat<00:01:29.040> and

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
countersink so that they're flat and

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.940 
countersink so that they're flat and
that<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:30.049> handle<00:01:31.049> was<00:01:31.170> actually<00:01:31.530> pinched

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
that the handle was actually pinched

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.620 
that the handle was actually pinched
onto<00:01:32.310> theirs<00:01:32.490> well<00:01:32.850> so<00:01:33.030> I'd<00:01:33.180> rolled<00:01:33.450> and

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
onto theirs well so I'd rolled and

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.359 
onto theirs well so I'd rolled and
rolled<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.020> drilled<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.650> I<00:01:34.770> got<00:01:34.950> one<00:01:35.189> of<00:01:35.310> the

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
rolled and drilled and I got one of the

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.760 
rolled and drilled and I got one of the
pins<00:01:35.610> out<00:01:35.820> with<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.090> hammer<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.619> punch<00:01:38.990> and<00:01:39.990> I

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
pins out with a hammer and a punch and I

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.260 
pins out with a hammer and a punch and I
was<00:01:40.890> working<00:01:41.070> on<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.400> rest<00:01:41.579> of<00:01:41.700> them<00:01:41.820> my<00:01:42.000> next

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
was working on the rest of them my next

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.539 
was working on the rest of them my next
door<00:01:42.360> neighbor<00:01:42.600> came<00:01:42.840> over<00:01:43.220> he<00:01:44.220> said<00:01:44.399> well

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
door neighbor came over he said well

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.020 
door neighbor came over he said well
come<00:01:44.700> on<00:01:44.820> over<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.119> use<00:01:45.360> my<00:01:45.950> 20-ton<00:01:47.030> hydraulic

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
come on over and use my 20-ton hydraulic

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.389 
come on over and use my 20-ton hydraulic
jack<00:01:48.299> press<00:01:48.630> so<00:01:49.020> that<00:01:49.290> made<00:01:49.770> quick<00:01:50.070> work<00:01:50.100> of

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
jack press so that made quick work of

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.810 
jack press so that made quick work of
that<00:01:50.460> got<00:01:50.880> these<00:01:51.030> pins<00:01:51.360> out<00:01:52.070> no<00:01:53.070> problem<00:01:53.579> but

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
that got these pins out no problem but

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.480 
that got these pins out no problem but
again<00:01:54.090> that<00:01:54.810> it<00:01:55.020> takes<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.350> big<00:01:55.770> effort<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.189> get

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
again that it takes a big effort to get

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.030 
again that it takes a big effort to get
this<00:01:56.670> get<00:01:57.630> these<00:01:57.810> apart<00:01:58.229> so<00:01:58.530> it's<00:01:58.680> a<00:01:58.799> sound

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
this get these apart so it's a sound

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.359 
this get these apart so it's a sound
method<00:01:59.640> of<00:01:59.759> making<00:02:00.750> your<00:02:01.020> handles<00:02:01.469> and<00:02:01.710> then<00:02:02.340> I

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
method of making your handles and then I

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.219 
method of making your handles and then I
think<00:02:02.670> we<00:02:02.790> put<00:02:03.000> enough<00:02:03.270> pressure<00:02:03.450> on<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:04.020> that

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
think we put enough pressure on it that

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.380 
think we put enough pressure on it that
you<00:02:04.829> know<00:02:04.950> this<00:02:05.159> one<00:02:05.399> just<00:02:05.610> wants<00:02:05.939> to<00:02:06.119> come

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
you know this one just wants to come

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.770 
you know this one just wants to come
right<00:02:06.600> off<00:02:08.000> we'll<00:02:09.000> see<00:02:09.179> if<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.390> other<00:02:09.569> one

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
right off we'll see if the other one

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.589 
right off we'll see if the other one
will<00:02:10.370> maybe<00:02:11.370> not<00:02:11.640> I<00:02:11.879> may<00:02:12.180> have<00:02:12.239> to<00:02:12.450> get<00:02:12.569> a

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
will maybe not I may have to get a

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.110 
will maybe not I may have to get a
screwed

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
screwed

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.539 
screwed
and<00:02:13.450> try<00:02:13.599> this<00:02:13.659> one<00:02:14.049> see<00:02:14.739> what<00:02:14.860> this<00:02:15.099> does<00:02:15.340> if

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:15.549 
and try this one see what this does if

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:21.390 
and try this one see what this does if
it<00:02:15.700> wants<00:02:15.940> to<00:02:16.060> come<00:02:16.239> up<00:02:16.390> seems<00:02:17.290> to<00:02:20.159> there<00:02:21.159> goes

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
it wants to come up seems to there goes

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.360 
it wants to come up seems to there goes
I<00:02:21.930> just<00:02:22.930> wanted<00:02:23.260> to<00:02:23.349> point<00:02:23.560> out<00:02:23.769> that<00:02:23.980> this<00:02:24.159> is

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
I just wanted to point out that this is

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.729 
I just wanted to point out that this is
after<00:02:24.580> two<00:02:25.030> years<00:02:25.269> of<00:02:25.420> use<00:02:25.840> in<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.260> American

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
after two years of use in the American

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:28.680 
after two years of use in the American
South<00:02:27.069> where<00:02:27.099> it's<00:02:27.610> hot<00:02:27.819> and<00:02:28.030> humid<00:02:28.180> and<00:02:28.540> this

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
South where it's hot and humid and this

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.030 
South where it's hot and humid and this
thing's<00:02:28.930> been<00:02:29.110> put<00:02:29.440> through<00:02:29.470> the<00:02:29.739> wringer

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
thing's been put through the wringer

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.210 
thing's been put through the wringer
there's<00:02:30.760> no<00:02:30.970> rust<00:02:31.620> and<00:02:32.620> that<00:02:32.769> was<00:02:32.920> the<00:02:33.040> main

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
there's no rust and that was the main

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.130 
there's no rust and that was the main
purpose<00:02:33.489> of<00:02:33.730> the<00:02:33.819> epoxy<00:02:34.150> was<00:02:34.510> just<00:02:34.750> to<00:02:34.870> seal

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
purpose of the epoxy was just to seal

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.960 
purpose of the epoxy was just to seal
this<00:02:35.379> off<00:02:35.620> so<00:02:35.980> that<00:02:36.159> water<00:02:36.459> and<00:02:36.700> stuff

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
this off so that water and stuff

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.399 
this off so that water and stuff
wouldn't<00:02:37.269> get<00:02:37.420> in<00:02:37.510> there<00:02:37.690> and<00:02:37.840> potentially

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:38.409 
wouldn't get in there and potentially

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:46.150 
wouldn't get in there and potentially
rust<00:02:38.680> this

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.820 

another<00:02:46.820> problem<00:02:47.120> I<00:02:47.390> found<00:02:47.630> when<00:02:48.290> I<00:02:48.320> got<00:02:48.440> this

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
another problem I found when I got this

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.540 
another problem I found when I got this
apart<00:02:49.310> is<00:02:49.580> that<00:02:49.610> it's<00:02:49.970> not<00:02:50.590> it's<00:02:51.590> not<00:02:51.770> there's

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
apart is that it's not it's not there's

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.720 
apart is that it's not it's not there's
a<00:02:52.610> little<00:02:52.880> bit<00:02:53.030> of<00:02:53.150> a<00:02:53.950> curve<00:02:54.950> to<00:02:54.980> the<00:02:55.280> handle

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
a little bit of a curve to the handle

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.270 
a little bit of a curve to the handle
it's<00:02:55.970> slight<00:02:56.390> but<00:02:56.690> it's<00:02:56.810> there<00:02:57.200> and<00:02:57.920> I'm<00:02:58.190> gonna

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
it's slight but it's there and I'm gonna

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.410 
it's slight but it's there and I'm gonna
take<00:02:58.550> that<00:02:58.580> out<00:02:58.940> of<00:02:59.090> there

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
take that out of there

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.100 
take that out of there
now<00:03:00.160> I'm<00:03:01.160> not<00:03:01.370> sure<00:03:01.610> if<00:03:01.730> I<00:03:01.850> got<00:03:02.480> that<00:03:02.690> in<00:03:02.930> there

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
now I'm not sure if I got that in there

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.950 
now I'm not sure if I got that in there
when<00:03:03.290> I<00:03:03.320> was<00:03:03.440> pressing<00:03:04.010> this<00:03:04.160> out<00:03:04.370> or<00:03:04.580> what<00:03:04.960> or

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:05.960 
when I was pressing this out or what or

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.800 
when I was pressing this out or what or
more<00:03:06.860> than<00:03:07.040> likely<00:03:07.070> I<00:03:07.640> kind<00:03:08.180> of<00:03:08.240> left<00:03:08.480> it<00:03:08.630> this

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
more than likely I kind of left it this

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.570 
more than likely I kind of left it this
way<00:03:09.050> when<00:03:09.560> I<00:03:09.590> made<00:03:09.860> it<00:03:09.890> because<00:03:10.040> I<00:03:10.220> didn't<00:03:10.460> know

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
way when I made it because I didn't know

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.790 
way when I made it because I didn't know
this<00:03:10.790> trick<00:03:11.090> that<00:03:11.270> I'm<00:03:11.360> about<00:03:11.600> to<00:03:11.810> show<00:03:11.990> you<00:03:12.020> it

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
this trick that I'm about to show you it

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.000 
this trick that I'm about to show you it
doesn't<00:03:13.550> take<00:03:13.760> much<00:03:14.060> and<00:03:14.540> you<00:03:14.840> can<00:03:15.020> you<00:03:15.860> can

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
doesn't take much and you can you can

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.880 
doesn't take much and you can you can
take<00:03:16.190> the<00:03:16.370> curve<00:03:16.670> out<00:03:16.910> of<00:03:17.030> that<00:03:17.680> now<00:03:18.680> you're

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
take the curve out of that now you're

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.210 
take the curve out of that now you're
like<00:03:19.630> well<00:03:20.630> okay<00:03:21.230> so<00:03:21.260> you<00:03:21.500> did<00:03:21.710> it<00:03:21.740> there<00:03:22.010> but

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
like well okay so you did it there but

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.100 
like well okay so you did it there but
as<00:03:22.340> soon<00:03:22.550> as<00:03:22.640> you<00:03:22.820> take<00:03:23.030> the<00:03:23.210> pressure<00:03:23.510> off<00:03:23.720> its

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
as soon as you take the pressure off its

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.820 
as soon as you take the pressure off its
gonna<00:03:24.350> snap<00:03:25.190> right<00:03:25.220> back<00:03:26.200> well<00:03:27.200> now<00:03:27.500> here's

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
gonna snap right back well now here's

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.090 
gonna snap right back well now here's
this<00:03:28.040> one<00:03:28.310> weird<00:03:28.640> trick<00:03:29.650> I'm<00:03:30.650> going<00:03:30.860> to<00:03:30.920> take

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
this one weird trick I'm going to take

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.850 
this one weird trick I'm going to take
this<00:03:31.310> and<00:03:31.610> put<00:03:31.670> it<00:03:31.970> in<00:03:32.090> the<00:03:32.210> oven<00:03:32.390> at<00:03:32.720> 400<00:03:33.590> for

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
this and put it in the oven at 400 for

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.180 
this and put it in the oven at 400 for
an<00:03:33.950> hour<00:03:34.130> and<00:03:34.520> then<00:03:34.970> that'll<00:03:35.420> re<00:03:36.190> hopefully

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
an hour and then that'll re hopefully

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.520 
an hour and then that'll re hopefully
reset<00:03:38.030> this<00:03:38.270> in<00:03:38.570> a<00:03:38.690> little<00:03:38.900> bit<00:03:39.020> more<00:03:39.200> flat

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
reset this in a little bit more flat

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.320 
reset this in a little bit more flat
position<00:03:39.890> so<00:03:40.400> I<00:03:40.430> got<00:03:40.730> it<00:03:40.880> out<00:03:40.970> of<00:03:41.120> the<00:03:41.180> oven

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
position so I got it out of the oven

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.860 
position so I got it out of the oven
took<00:03:41.690> the<00:03:41.810> clamps<00:03:42.230> off<00:03:42.790> and<00:03:43.790> it's<00:03:44.180> it's<00:03:44.480> pretty

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
took the clamps off and it's it's pretty

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.940 
took the clamps off and it's it's pretty
darn<00:03:45.650> flat<00:03:46.100> I<00:03:46.340> mean<00:03:46.520> there's<00:03:46.700> a<00:03:46.760> little<00:03:47.120> bit<00:03:47.270> of

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
darn flat I mean there's a little bit of

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.000 
darn flat I mean there's a little bit of
rock<00:03:48.950> to<00:03:49.280> it<00:03:49.430> but<00:03:49.850> I<00:03:50.090> mean<00:03:50.480> by<00:03:51.380> and<00:03:51.530> large<00:03:51.680> this

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
rock to it but I mean by and large this

00:03:52.010 --> 00:04:05.240 
rock to it but I mean by and large this
is<00:03:52.100> pretty<00:03:52.310> darn<00:03:52.490> good

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250

I didn't didn't get this done on on the
first<00:04:23.680> one<00:04:23.919> because<00:04:24.190> I<00:04:24.310> didn't<00:04:24.550> have<00:04:24.729> it<00:04:24.909> so

first one because I didn't have it so
put<00:04:26.830> a<00:04:26.860> dummy<00:04:27.069> holder

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.290 

I<00:04:42.210> did<00:04:43.110> a<00:04:43.280> differential<00:04:44.280> heat-treat<00:04:44.910> on<00:04:45.090> this

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
I did a differential heat-treat on this

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.570 
I did a differential heat-treat on this
blade<00:04:45.630> I'm<00:04:46.320> not<00:04:46.680> going<00:04:46.830> to<00:04:46.889> show<00:04:47.100> how<00:04:47.250> I<00:04:47.280> did

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
blade I'm not going to show how I did

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.580 
blade I'm not going to show how I did
that<00:04:48.590> now<00:04:49.590> it's<00:04:49.860> time<00:04:50.220> to<00:04:51.169> cut<00:04:52.169> off<00:04:52.320> some

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
that now it's time to cut off some

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.800 
that now it's time to cut off some
scales<00:04:53.040> here<00:04:53.699> and<00:04:55.880> get<00:04:56.880> them<00:04:57.000> drilled<00:04:57.360> and<00:04:57.690> get

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
scales here and get them drilled and get

00:04:57.810 --> 00:06:09.870 
scales here and get them drilled and get
everything<00:04:58.050> started

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:09.880 

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.750 

so<00:06:10.510> here<00:06:10.720> it<00:06:10.810> is<00:06:10.930> all<00:06:11.320> finished<00:06:11.590> up<00:06:11.950> and<00:06:12.250> I

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:12.760 
so here it is all finished up and I

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.700 
so here it is all finished up and I
think<00:06:12.970> it's<00:06:13.060> probably<00:06:13.300> shaving<00:06:13.810> sharp<00:06:14.310> yep

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:16.710 
think it's probably shaving sharp yep

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.890 
think it's probably shaving sharp yep

important<00:06:33.340> little<00:06:33.640> knife<00:06:34.060> for<00:06:34.360> me<00:06:34.480> because<00:06:34.780> it

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:34.960 
important little knife for me because it

important little knife for me because it
eventually<00:06:35.230> led<00:06:35.710> to<00:06:35.740> this<00:06:36.630> so<00:06:37.800> you<00:06:38.800> know<00:06:38.920> I

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:38.950 
eventually led to this so you know I

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:40.680 
eventually led to this so you know I
incorporated<00:06:39.700> a<00:06:39.880> bunch<00:06:40.090> of<00:06:40.240> things<00:06:40.390> that<00:06:40.540> I

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:40.690 
incorporated a bunch of things that I

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:42.510 
incorporated a bunch of things that I
learned<00:06:40.930> from<00:06:41.200> making<00:06:41.380> these<00:06:41.740> a<00:06:41.800> lawn<00:06:42.310> mower

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:42.520 
learned from making these a lawn mower

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.570 
learned from making these a lawn mower
blades<00:06:42.850> into<00:06:43.350> making<00:06:44.350> them<00:06:44.650> on<00:06:44.830> an<00:06:44.950> own<00:06:45.130> steel

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:45.580 
blades into making them on an own steel

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:49.920 
blades into making them on an own steel
and<00:06:46.740> someday<00:06:47.740> I'll<00:06:48.280> make<00:06:48.580> a<00:06:48.910> few<00:06:49.720> of<00:06:49.840> these

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:49.930 
and someday I'll make a few of these

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:54.000 
and someday I'll make a few of these
available<00:06:50.560> but<00:06:50.770> not<00:06:51.010> yet
