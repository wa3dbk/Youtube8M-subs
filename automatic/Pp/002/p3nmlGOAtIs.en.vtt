00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
huge fan of assisted knives but this

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.720 
huge fan of assisted knives but this
one's<00:02:54.720> actually<00:02:54.840> pretty<00:02:55.140> nice<00:02:57.950> the<00:02:58.950> only<00:02:59.280> size

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
one's actually pretty nice the only size

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.310 
one's actually pretty nice the only size
comparison<00:03:00.390> I<00:03:00.450> have<00:03:00.630> for<00:03:00.810> you<00:03:00.840> guys<00:03:01.050> right<00:03:01.260> now

comparison I have for you guys right now

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.160 
comparison I have for you guys right now
is<00:03:01.710> a<00:03:01.940> another<00:03:02.940> knife<00:03:03.240> I<00:03:03.390> pretty<00:03:03.750> recently

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
is a another knife I pretty recently

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.150 
is a another knife I pretty recently
it's<00:03:04.680> an<00:03:04.800> older<00:03:05.070> knife<00:03:05.250> this<00:03:06.150> is<00:03:06.300> the<00:03:06.390> OD<00:03:06.690> one

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
it's an older knife this is the OD one

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.240 
it's an older knife this is the OD one
but<00:03:08.160> if<00:03:08.250> you're<00:03:08.370> familiar<00:03:08.520> with<00:03:08.760> that<00:03:08.910> you<00:03:09.720> can

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
but if you're familiar with that you can

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.760 
but if you're familiar with that you can
get<00:03:11.250> a<00:03:11.310> little<00:03:11.490> size<00:03:11.730> comparison<00:03:11.760> right<00:03:12.390> there

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 
get a little size comparison right there

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.110 
get a little size comparison right there
believe<00:03:13.770> the<00:03:13.920> blade<00:03:14.220> on<00:03:14.400> this<00:03:14.550> is<00:03:14.700> three<00:03:14.970> and<00:03:15.000> a

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
believe the blade on this is three and a

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.350 
believe the blade on this is three and a
quarter<00:03:15.300> inch<00:03:16.220> it's<00:03:17.220> one<00:03:17.850> of<00:03:17.970> the<00:03:18.060> smaller

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
quarter inch it's one of the smaller

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.230 
quarter inch it's one of the smaller
zero-tolerance<00:03:18.900> nice<00:03:19.850> i'll<00:03:20.850> put<00:03:21.120> the

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:21.240 
zero-tolerance nice i'll put the

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:27.110 
zero-tolerance nice i'll put the
complete<00:03:21.930> specs<00:03:22.260> in<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:25.130> below<00:03:26.130> the<00:03:26.340> video<00:03:26.459> so

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
complete specs in the below the video so

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.900 
complete specs in the below the video so
you<00:03:27.180> guys<00:03:27.330> could<00:03:27.480> check<00:03:27.690> them<00:03:27.810> out<00:03:28.310> but<00:03:29.310> I<00:03:29.580> just

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
you guys could check them out but I just

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.290 
you guys could check them out but I just
wanted<00:03:30.180> to<00:03:30.240> show<00:03:30.750> this<00:03:30.930> off<00:03:31.140> I<00:03:32.030> haven't<00:03:33.030> carry

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
wanted to show this off I haven't carry

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.690 
wanted to show this off I haven't carry
it<00:03:33.480> or<00:03:33.630> didn't<00:03:33.989> carried<00:03:34.500> it<00:03:34.620> or<00:03:34.769> anything<00:03:35.010> so<00:03:35.489> I

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
it or didn't carried it or anything so I

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.910 
it or didn't carried it or anything so I
can't<00:03:36.420> really<00:03:36.540> speak<00:03:36.900> a<00:03:37.230> whole<00:03:37.440> lot<00:03:37.650> about<00:03:37.680> it

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
can't really speak a whole lot about it

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.160 
can't really speak a whole lot about it
but<00:03:38.180> just<00:03:39.180> wanted<00:03:39.450> to<00:03:39.570> tell<00:03:39.720> you<00:03:39.750> if<00:03:39.989> you're

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
but just wanted to tell you if you're

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.930 
but just wanted to tell you if you're
considering<00:03:40.560> it<00:03:40.800> to<00:03:41.250> get<00:03:41.430> it<00:03:41.550> quick<00:03:41.790> because

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
considering it to get it quick because

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.640 
considering it to get it quick because
it<00:03:42.209> is<00:03:42.300> a<00:03:42.420> limited<00:03:42.660> run<00:03:43.050> and<00:03:43.350> they're<00:03:43.530> not

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
it is a limited run and they're not

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.479 
it is a limited run and they're not
going<00:03:43.800> to<00:03:43.890> make<00:03:44.040> very<00:03:44.489> many<00:03:44.610> of<00:03:44.820> them<00:03:46.430> they<00:03:47.430> do

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
going to make very many of them they do

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:52.940 
going to make very many of them they do
make<00:03:47.640> it<00:03:48.030> in<00:03:48.150> a<00:03:48.239> full<00:03:48.480> zdp<00:03:48.810> now<00:03:49.670> um<00:03:51.200> GDP<00:03:52.200> 189<00:03:52.709> now

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
make it in a full zdp now um GDP 189 now

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.759 
make it in a full zdp now um GDP 189 now
but<00:03:53.250> I<00:03:53.959> don't<00:03:54.959> know<00:03:55.019> it's<00:03:55.350> got<00:03:55.470> the<00:03:55.590> black

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
but I don't know it's got the black

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:58.550 
but I don't know it's got the black
blade<00:03:56.040> and<00:03:56.340> I<00:03:56.580> kind<00:03:57.480> of<00:03:57.540> prefer<00:03:57.690> the<00:03:57.900> Sandvik

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
blade and I kind of prefer the Sandvik

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.820 
blade and I kind of prefer the Sandvik
for<00:03:59.160> the<00:03:59.250> regular<00:03:59.690> part<00:04:00.690> and<00:04:00.959> that<00:04:00.989> zdp<00:04:01.470> for

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
for the regular part and that zdp for

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.150 
for the regular part and that zdp for
the<00:04:01.890> cutting<00:04:02.190> edge<00:04:02.360> as<00:04:03.360> GDP<00:04:04.320> is<00:04:04.500> a<00:04:04.650> pretty<00:04:04.920> hard

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
the cutting edge as GDP is a pretty hard

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.229 
the cutting edge as GDP is a pretty hard
steel<00:04:05.489> and<00:04:06.890> just<00:04:07.890> thought<00:04:08.070> it<00:04:08.220> suited<00:04:08.459> a<00:04:08.670> just

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
steel and just thought it suited a just

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:14.540 
steel and just thought it suited a just
style<00:04:09.510> knife<00:04:09.750> better<00:04:11.209> he's<00:04:12.209> got<00:04:13.160> thumb<00:04:14.160> studs

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
style knife better he's got thumb studs

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:20.120 
style knife better he's got thumb studs
but<00:04:14.730> they<00:04:16.400> they<00:04:17.400> also<00:04:17.519> act<00:04:17.820> as<00:04:18.030> the<00:04:18.830> blade<00:04:19.830> stop

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
but they they also act as the blade stop

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.740 
but they they also act as the blade stop
there's<00:04:20.729> no<00:04:20.880> stop<00:04:21.359> pin<00:04:21.570> in<00:04:21.720> there<00:04:22.430> and

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
there's no stop pin in there and

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.180 
there's no stop pin in there and
honestly<00:04:24.750> when<00:04:24.960> you're<00:04:25.050> holding<00:04:25.350> it<00:04:25.500> it's<00:04:26.100> a

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
honestly when you're holding it it's a

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:31.010 
honestly when you're holding it it's a
lot<00:04:26.370> easier<00:04:26.580> use<00:04:27.330> of<00:04:27.479> flipper<00:04:29.780> pretty<00:04:30.780> sweet

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
lot easier use of flipper pretty sweet

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:36.110 
lot easier use of flipper pretty sweet
knife<00:04:31.229> um<00:04:32.479> it's<00:04:33.479> actually<00:04:34.550> weight<00:04:35.550> wise<00:04:35.790> it's

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
knife um it's actually weight wise it's

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.750 
knife um it's actually weight wise it's
really<00:04:36.780> nice<00:04:36.930> it's<00:04:37.320> not<00:04:37.530> not<00:04:38.010> too<00:04:38.220> heavy<00:04:38.400> feels

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
really nice it's not not too heavy feels

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.330 
really nice it's not not too heavy feels
perfect
