her zombie pimp it was kind of I'm like

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.770 
her zombie pimp it was kind of I'm like
what<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.789> she<00:00:53.820> on<00:00:54.149> drugs<00:00:54.420> or<00:00:54.719> something

what is she on drugs or something

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.080 
what is she on drugs or something
because<00:00:55.140> I<00:00:55.350> can<00:00:55.500> understand<00:00:55.949> that<00:00:56.219> she's<00:00:56.789> kind

of<00:00:57.180> haunted<00:00:57.690> by<00:00:57.870> her<00:00:58.020> past<00:00:58.050> I<00:00:58.590> think<00:00:58.800> that's

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
of haunted by her past I think that's

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.130

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
what was so bad about it at first I mean

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.100 
what was so bad about it at first I mean
he<00:01:46.560> just<00:01:46.740> seems<00:01:46.950> like<00:01:47.189> a<00:01:47.670> reg<00:01:48.329> kid<00:01:48.720> that

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
he just seems like a reg kid that

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.590 
he just seems like a reg kid that
doesn't<00:01:49.560> like<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.520> be<00:01:50.700> rich<00:01:51.000> I<00:01:51.210> mean<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:51.450> think

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
doesn't like to be rich I mean I think

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.060 
doesn't like to be rich I mean I think
there's<00:01:52.020> something<00:01:52.229> going<00:01:52.590> on<00:01:52.710> with<00:01:52.890> his

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
there's something going on with his

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.069 
there's something going on with his
mother<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.490> father<00:01:53.790> because<00:01:54.540> one<00:01:54.840> of<00:01:54.869> the

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
mother and father because one of the

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.780 
mother and father because one of the
maids<00:01:55.439> I<00:01:55.799> think<00:01:56.040> mentioned<00:01:56.430> something<00:01:56.729> about

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
maids I think mentioned something about

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.580 
maids I think mentioned something about
his<00:01:57.119> dad<00:01:57.390> having<00:01:57.689> a<00:01:57.750> prostitute<00:01:58.200> or<00:01:58.259> something

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
his dad having a prostitute or something

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.830 
his dad having a prostitute or something
but<00:01:58.890> I<00:01:58.979> can't<00:01:59.040> exactly<00:01:59.490> gauge<00:01:59.969> why<00:02:00.420> he's<00:02:00.689> so

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
but I can't exactly gauge why he's so

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.459 
but I can't exactly gauge why he's so

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:06.980 
irritated it's obvious that his other
siblings<00:02:04.469> are<00:02:04.710> more<00:02:04.979> favored<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:06.090> seems<00:02:06.420> but<00:02:06.780> I
