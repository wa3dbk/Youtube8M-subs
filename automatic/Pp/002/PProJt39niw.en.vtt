clay
notice<00:00:33.600> I'm<00:00:33.750> using<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:34.110> metal<00:00:34.320> cup<00:00:34.829> you

shouldn't really use metal with
bentonite<00:00:37.860> clay<00:00:37.920> but<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.280> felt<00:00:38.579> like<00:00:38.730> as<00:00:38.910> I

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
bentonite clay but I felt like as I

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.310 
bentonite clay but I felt like as I
wasn't<00:00:39.210> mixing<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:39.690> yet<00:00:39.870> it<00:00:39.989> didn't<00:00:40.230> really

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
wasn't mixing it yet it didn't really

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.770 
wasn't mixing it yet it didn't really
matter<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:40.860> then<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:41.730> poured<00:00:42.030> in<00:00:42.300> equal

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
matter and then I poured in equal

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.660 
matter and then I poured in equal
amounts<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:43.320> apple<00:00:43.950> cider<00:00:44.100> vinegar<00:00:44.250> now<00:00:44.640> I

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
amounts of apple cider vinegar now I

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.090 
amounts of apple cider vinegar now I
have<00:00:44.969> mixed<00:00:45.329> this<00:00:45.420> with<00:00:45.629> water<00:00:45.840> before<00:00:46.200> but<00:00:47.070> I

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
have mixed this with water before but I

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.160 
have mixed this with water before but I
find<00:00:47.489> that<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:48.090> apple<00:00:48.390> cider<00:00:48.510> vinegar<00:00:48.660> as<00:00:49.050> you

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
find that the apple cider vinegar as you

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.660 
find that the apple cider vinegar as you
can<00:00:49.320> see<00:00:49.500> makes<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:49.890> reacts<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:50.280> can<00:00:50.430> see<00:00:50.550> all

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
can see makes it reacts you can see all

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.450 
can see makes it reacts you can see all
the<00:00:50.760> bubbles<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.480> it's<00:00:51.809> fizzing<00:00:52.260> I<00:00:52.469> wanted<00:00:53.309> to

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
the bubbles and it's fizzing I wanted to

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.340 
the bubbles and it's fizzing I wanted to
draw<00:00:53.699> out<00:00:53.850> as<00:00:54.000> many<00:00:54.239> toxins<00:00:54.809> for<00:00:54.960> my<00:00:55.079> hair<00:00:55.230> as

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
draw out as many toxins for my hair as

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.869 
draw out as many toxins for my hair as
possible<00:00:55.379> so<00:00:55.949> I<00:00:55.980> wanted<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.550> use<00:00:56.699> something

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
possible so I wanted to use something

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.819 
possible so I wanted to use something
that<00:00:57.030> would<00:00:57.210> allow<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.570> bentonite<00:00:58.260> clay<00:00:58.320> to

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
that would allow the bentonite clay to

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.069 
that would allow the bentonite clay to
react<00:00:59.430> as<00:00:59.699> much<00:00:59.879> as<00:01:00.030> possible<00:01:00.449> so<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:00.930> just

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
react as much as possible so you just

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.869 
react as much as possible so you just
need<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.289> mix<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.829> I'm<00:01:01.980> mixing<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:02.730> with<00:01:02.820> a

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
need to mix it I'm mixing it with a

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.450 
need to mix it I'm mixing it with a
plastic<00:01:03.090> spoon<00:01:03.539> as<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:03.870> can<00:01:04.049> see<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.650> then<00:01:05.280> I

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
plastic spoon as you can see and then I

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.950 
plastic spoon as you can see and then I
let<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.670> settle<00:01:06.000> for<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.299> while<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.659> it<00:01:06.780> does

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
let it settle for a while and it does

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.450 
let it settle for a while and it does
start<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.350> thicken<00:01:07.619> up<00:01:07.860> so<00:01:08.070> it<00:01:08.189> still

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
start to thicken up so it still

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.280 
start to thicken up so it still
continues<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.060> bubble<00:01:09.330> for<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.510> while<00:01:09.659> I<00:01:09.869> want

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
continues to bubble for a while I want

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.719 
continues to bubble for a while I want
to<00:01:10.350> see<00:01:10.470> if<00:01:10.530> it's<00:01:10.830> thickened<00:01:11.220> up<00:01:11.310> as<00:01:11.430> much<00:01:11.580> as

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
to see if it's thickened up as much as

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.240 
to see if it's thickened up as much as
possible<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:12.330> then<00:01:12.990> I<00:01:13.229> moved<00:01:13.470> on<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.650> mixing

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
possible and then I moved on to mixing

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.399 
possible and then I moved on to mixing
my<00:01:14.430> henna<00:01:14.640> gloss<00:01:14.909> as<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:15.270> can<00:01:15.420> see<00:01:15.659> so<00:01:16.200> it's

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
my henna gloss as you can see so it's

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.560 
my henna gloss as you can see so it's
the<00:01:16.560> same<00:01:16.799> sort<00:01:16.860> of<00:01:17.220> concept<00:01:17.400> as<00:01:17.850> my<00:01:18.030> henna<00:01:18.299> I

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
the same sort of concept as my henna I

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.240 
the same sort of concept as my henna I
just<00:01:18.840> mixed<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.290> with<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.590> green<00:01:19.950> tea<00:01:20.220> I

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
just mixed it with the green tea I

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.070 
just mixed it with the green tea I
didn't<00:01:20.549> add<00:01:20.670> any<00:01:20.700> coconut<00:01:21.270> milk<00:01:21.509> but<00:01:21.840> instead

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
didn't add any coconut milk but instead

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.539 
didn't add any coconut milk but instead
of<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.259> coconut<00:01:22.619> milk<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:22.920> added<00:01:22.950> some

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
of a coconut milk I added some

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.640 
of a coconut milk I added some
conditioner<00:01:24.390> which<00:01:24.570> makes<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:24.960> much<00:01:25.290> more

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
conditioner which makes it much more

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.859 
conditioner which makes it much more
smoother<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.369> easy<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.939> apply<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.450> then

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
smoother and easy to apply and then

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.899 
smoother and easy to apply and then
added<00:01:28.170> some<00:01:28.200> coconut<00:01:28.590> oil<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.220> mixed<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:29.820> up

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
added some coconut oil and mixed it up

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.179 
added some coconut oil and mixed it up
and<00:01:30.119> left<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.630> settle<00:01:31.079> now<00:01:31.650> let's<00:01:31.860> move<00:01:32.009> on

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
and left it to settle now let's move on

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.789 
and left it to settle now let's move on
to<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.430> application<00:01:32.579> process<00:01:33.470> first<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.680> all

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
to the application process first of all

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.219 
to the application process first of all
this<00:01:35.130> is<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.850> washer<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.600> dryer<00:01:36.659> that<00:01:36.990> I<00:01:37.079> had

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
this is a washer and dryer that I had

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.170 
this is a washer and dryer that I had
done<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.650> few<00:01:37.770> days<00:01:38.130> before<00:01:38.579> I<00:01:38.610> hadn't<00:01:39.030> used

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
done a few days before I hadn't used

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.030 
done a few days before I hadn't used
much<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.630> holding<00:01:40.079> product<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:40.619> wasn't<00:01:40.890> very

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
much of a holding product it wasn't very

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.649 
much of a holding product it wasn't very
strong<00:01:41.280> hold<00:01:41.549> so<00:01:41.820> you<00:01:41.850> can<00:01:42.060> see<00:01:42.240> it's<00:01:42.420> kind<00:01:42.600> of

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
strong hold so you can see it's kind of

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.539 
strong hold so you can see it's kind of
shrunken<00:01:43.079> up<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.290> bit<00:01:43.470> so<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.040> first<00:01:44.070> thing<00:01:44.490> I

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
shrunken up a bit so the first thing I

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.100 
shrunken up a bit so the first thing I
wanted<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:44.850> do<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.210> was<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.360> just<00:01:45.720> stretch<00:01:45.930> out

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
wanted to do it was to just stretch out

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.950 
wanted to do it was to just stretch out
the<00:01:46.170> hair<00:01:46.470> I<00:01:46.710> used<00:01:47.159> a<00:01:47.280> bit<00:01:47.399> of<00:01:47.430> water<00:01:47.729> to

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.690 
the hair I used a bit of water to
lightly<00:01:48.960> spray<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.770> then<00:01:49.890> detangle<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.579> hair

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
lightly spray and then detangle the hair

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.760 
lightly spray and then detangle the hair
I<00:01:50.850> didn't<00:01:51.119> want<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.420> finger<00:01:51.689> detangle<00:01:52.170> -<00:01:52.320> also

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
I didn't want to finger detangle - also

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.950 
I didn't want to finger detangle - also
I<00:01:54.020> needed<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.110> cough<00:01:55.350> apologies<00:01:56.310> I<00:01:56.960> fingered

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
I needed to cough apologies I fingered

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.100 
I needed to cough apologies I fingered
the<00:01:58.049> time<00:01:58.259> with<00:01:58.439> it

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
the time with it

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.970 
the time with it
and<00:01:59.200> then<00:01:59.530> I<00:01:59.890> used<00:02:00.430> the<00:02:00.880> kite<00:02:01.720> so<00:02:02.080> I<00:02:02.140> dropped<00:02:02.830> it

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:02.980 
and then I used the kite so I dropped it

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.040 
and then I used the kite so I dropped it
on<00:02:03.070> my<00:02:03.160> hands<00:02:03.550> and<00:02:03.670> then<00:02:03.850> simply<00:02:04.330> started<00:02:04.780> to

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
on my hands and then simply started to

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.900 
on my hands and then simply started to
smooth<00:02:05.950> it<00:02:06.160> through<00:02:06.340> the<00:02:06.430> hair<00:02:06.580> you<00:02:06.700> want<00:02:06.790> to

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
smooth it through the hair you want to

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.790 
smooth it through the hair you want to
make<00:02:07.030> sure<00:02:07.150> that<00:02:07.450> it's<00:02:07.570> come<00:02:07.750> to<00:02:07.900> every<00:02:08.530> single

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
make sure that it's come to every single

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.490 
make sure that it's come to every single
strand<00:02:09.429> so<00:02:10.060> what<00:02:10.179> I<00:02:10.210> did<00:02:10.300> was<00:02:10.570> I've<00:02:10.750> very<00:02:11.080> very

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
strand so what I did was I've very very

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.140 
strand so what I did was I've very very
lightly<00:02:11.770> fingers<00:02:12.190> at<00:02:12.280> angle<00:02:12.580> what<00:02:12.880> I<00:02:12.910> don't

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
lightly fingers at angle what I don't

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.720 
lightly fingers at angle what I don't
suggest<00:02:13.300> is<00:02:13.810> if<00:02:14.230> you've<00:02:14.500> got<00:02:14.530> big<00:02:15.010> tangles<00:02:15.550> you

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
suggest is if you've got big tangles you

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.670 
suggest is if you've got big tangles you
try<00:02:15.970> and<00:02:16.060> Vic<00:02:16.210> through<00:02:16.540> it<00:02:16.690> if<00:02:17.080> you<00:02:17.260> just<00:02:17.440> got<00:02:17.620> a

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
try and Vic through it if you just got a

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.340 
try and Vic through it if you just got a
few<00:02:18.070> one<00:02:18.430> or<00:02:18.460> two<00:02:18.610> strand<00:02:19.150> knots<00:02:19.360> they're<00:02:20.050> just

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
few one or two strand knots they're just

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.350 
few one or two strand knots they're just
lightly<00:02:20.860> fingers<00:02:21.490> tangle<00:02:21.820> as<00:02:21.910> you<00:02:21.970> go<00:02:22.120> through

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
lightly fingers tangle as you go through

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.970 
lightly fingers tangle as you go through
and<00:02:22.600> make<00:02:22.810> sure<00:02:22.840> you're<00:02:23.200> creating<00:02:23.620> it<00:02:23.710> from

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
and make sure you're creating it from

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.550 
and make sure you're creating it from
root<00:02:24.220> to<00:02:24.250> tip<00:02:24.400> now<00:02:25.300> this<00:02:25.510> is<00:02:25.660> as<00:02:25.840> I've<00:02:26.020> moved<00:02:26.380> a

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
root to tip now this is as I've moved a

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.350 
root to tip now this is as I've moved a
bit<00:02:26.709> further<00:02:26.950> up<00:02:27.250> so<00:02:27.520> I<00:02:27.580> went<00:02:27.760> section<00:02:28.060> by

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
bit further up so I went section by

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.850 
bit further up so I went section by
section<00:02:28.420> as<00:02:28.870> always<00:02:29.200> which<00:02:29.410> makes<00:02:29.650> the

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
section as always which makes the

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.190 
section as always which makes the
application<00:02:30.220> process<00:02:30.820> a<00:02:31.030> lot<00:02:31.270> easier<00:02:31.390> and<00:02:31.930> as

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
application process a lot easier and as

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.350 
application process a lot easier and as
you<00:02:32.320> can<00:02:32.470> see<00:02:32.620> it<00:02:32.709> stretches<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.610> hair<00:02:33.820> okay

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
you can see it stretches the hair okay

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.730 
you can see it stretches the hair okay
so<00:02:34.600> you<00:02:34.900> want<00:02:35.110> to<00:02:35.200> make<00:02:35.320> sure<00:02:35.350> that<00:02:35.620> it's

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
so you want to make sure that it's

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.290 
so you want to make sure that it's
coating<00:02:36.070> it<00:02:36.160> enough<00:02:36.520> that<00:02:36.940> it's<00:02:37.060> weighing

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
coating it enough that it's weighing

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.690 
coating it enough that it's weighing
your<00:02:37.660> hair<00:02:37.720> down<00:02:37.930> a<00:02:38.200> bit<00:02:38.530> now<00:02:39.040> if<00:02:39.280> you<00:02:39.430> look<00:02:39.580> at

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
your hair down a bit now if you look at

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:40.949 
your hair down a bit now if you look at
that<00:02:39.820> you<00:02:39.910> can<00:02:39.940> person<00:02:40.390> to<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:40.540> other<00:02:40.570> side

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
that you can person to the other side

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.690 
that you can person to the other side
where<00:02:41.110> it's<00:02:41.200> shrunken<00:02:41.500> up<00:02:41.620> you<00:02:41.770> can<00:02:41.920> see<00:02:42.220> how

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
where it's shrunken up you can see how

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.460 
where it's shrunken up you can see how
much<00:02:42.910> stretch<00:02:43.330> that<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:43.630> hair<00:02:43.810> just<00:02:44.260> make

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
much stretch that the hair just make

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.530 
much stretch that the hair just make
sure<00:02:44.650> it's<00:02:44.800> counting<00:02:45.160> every<00:02:45.580> single<00:02:45.970> part<00:02:46.209> as

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
sure it's counting every single part as

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.020 
sure it's counting every single part as
so<00:02:47.050> and<00:02:47.380> then<00:02:47.770> once<00:02:47.920> you've<00:02:48.070> finished<00:02:48.250> smooth

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
so and then once you've finished smooth

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.390 
so and then once you've finished smooth
the<00:02:49.450> rest<00:02:49.690> over<00:02:50.170> so<00:02:50.380> I'm<00:02:50.560> smooth<00:02:50.770> over<00:02:51.160> all<00:02:51.250> of

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
the rest over so I'm smooth over all of

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.940 
the rest over so I'm smooth over all of
my<00:02:51.489> hair<00:02:51.930> pulled<00:02:52.930> whatever<00:02:53.320> that<00:02:53.500> was<00:02:53.680> off<00:02:53.920> my

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
my hair pulled whatever that was off my

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.310 
my hair pulled whatever that was off my
face<00:02:54.430> and<00:02:54.760> then<00:02:54.970> just<00:02:55.030> made<00:02:55.810> sure<00:02:55.989> that<00:02:56.170> I<00:02:56.230> had

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
face and then just made sure that I had

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.870 
face and then just made sure that I had
bobbed<00:02:56.620> it<00:02:56.739> on<00:02:56.830> to<00:02:56.920> my<00:02:57.010> scalp<00:02:57.280> as<00:02:57.430> well<00:02:57.459> because

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880

the dye beliefs will be a little bit
less<00:04:20.019> poignant<00:04:20.859> than<00:04:21.130> a<00:04:21.459> normal<00:04:21.850> hammer
