00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
I saw yep take a look at that I was just

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.470 
I saw yep take a look at that I was just
like

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:55.480 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.310 

bra

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.530 

so<00:01:59.070> there's<00:01:59.310> no<00:01:59.460> point<00:01:59.700> in<00:01:59.909> me<00:02:00.090> indeed<00:02:00.510> even

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
so there's no point in me indeed even

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.120 
so there's no point in me indeed even
selling<00:02:01.200> on<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.320> players<00:02:01.620> or<00:02:01.800> anything

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
selling on the players or anything

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.710 
selling on the players or anything
spending<00:02:02.460> time<00:02:02.610> on<00:02:02.760> that<00:02:02.850> because<00:02:03.180> I<00:02:03.330> I<00:02:03.390> know

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
spending time on that because I I know

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.810 
spending time on that because I I know
that<00:02:04.020> I<00:02:04.050> lost<00:02:04.350> anyway<00:02:04.830> because<00:02:05.220> if<00:02:05.610> the

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
that I lost anyway because if the

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.730 
that I lost anyway because if the
players<00:02:06.060> have<00:02:06.240> all<00:02:06.450> everything<00:02:07.170> is<00:02:07.320> that<00:02:07.590> all

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
players have all everything is that all

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.440 
players have all everything is that all
of<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.009> players<00:02:08.190> basically<00:02:08.459> sold<00:02:08.880> I<00:02:09.119> would

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
of the players basically sold I would

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.240
