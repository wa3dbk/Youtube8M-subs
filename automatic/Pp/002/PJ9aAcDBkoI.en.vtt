00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:13.029
 they all did 

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:15.329
 I was very shocked by the 

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:18.720
 on the phone I know he says what about this club 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.230
 it's something else 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.130
 more the team must not be a negative thing to the site he notices 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.630
 additional pressure on prices 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.439
 I already have it 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.189
 pressure 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:34.030
 but who is inherent in his childhood childhood to know to be attacker of 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.000
 score goals and 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.170
 so here to compare parachute and more in europe 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.140
 I tried to adapt 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.550
 to his partners and his lands 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.810
 its partners its partners also to adapt so well our knowledge 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.860
 reciprocal 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.970
 equalizing technique that is important between the smuggler and the receiver this is 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.700
 not overnight in May 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.170
 potential and qualities 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.970
 elisa and 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.970
 editing however 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.970
 I do not like price comparisons between players and even less 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.780
 crowley 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.780
 the eras but we did not compare it to kaka on the body by which 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.100
 a few years 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.010
 straightforward I hope for him that he 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.100
 who will put them but the most important thing is 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.040
 to make effect 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.040
 Gignac 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.860
 it's always less difficult like every day to come 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.550
 and percent 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.659
 now he's playing for the future of our young drivers 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:49.229
 it's always less complicated 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.030
 after it's complicated these negotiations with the ol 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:59.780
 with Toulon with another club and that's not so much about me for my 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.270
 we started the process and it was done quickly because the word 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.270
 secular powers 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.549
 before I can not necessarily 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:13.409
 what we are looking for when we see the day, looking for all the quality in 

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:15.399
 looking for everyone 

00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:19.239
 if I make an accent the taught who the level he has informed anyway a 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.239
 full man 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:27.170
 the summer mercato 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.309
 the lucky ones 

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:33.569
 a list of players that ever the name that is frozen according to the state of the 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.779
 negotiations and years of others 

00:02:35.779 --> 00:02:37.309
 the society 

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:39.569
 he followed 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:40.929
 several tracks at once 

00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:44.329
 old professor who said that it was necessary in several irons fire 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:45.989
 I think he was right 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.769
 as for the case of thomas d'aquin 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.700
 a recruitment always remaining several solutions
