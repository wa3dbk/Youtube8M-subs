the heart of the great hyperspace war
and<00:05:31.470> the<00:05:31.860> war<00:05:32.070> we<00:05:32.280> fight<00:05:32.490> today<00:05:32.730> began<00:05:33.270> even

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 
and the war we fight today began even

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.130 
and the war we fight today began even
before<00:05:33.780> the<00:05:34.140> Sith<00:05:34.350> Empire<00:05:34.500> rose<00:05:35.040> to<00:05:35.250> power

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:36.140 
before the Sith Empire rose to power

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:42.230 
before the Sith Empire rose to power
I'll<00:05:37.140> elaborate<00:05:37.800> in<00:05:37.980> the<00:05:38.070> next<00:05:38.340> whole<00:05:38.490> record

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.770 

you

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:43.780 
you

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:48.300 
you
