00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:08.010
 mounting precise 0 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:11.070
 in this tutorial we will be the step by step 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:15.330
 how to mount a pc for such a you 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:19.650
 at least one office must have one 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:23.160
 cooler processor one motherboard one 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:28.109
 hard drive with a kind of memory 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:30.929
 ram and a dvd drive as a professional 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.350
 and in our case specifically one 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.059
 a card reader and a memory card. 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.850
 wireless network card 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.100
 but you can put as many 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.450
 devices your motherboard your hungry 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.469
 support and for those who have doubts 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.700
 follows an image of all 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.700
 equipment used in this tutorial 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.219
 but before we start to assemble the 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.140
 computer 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.780
 we'll take a quick look at the board 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.660
 because that's where we'll put everyone 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.730
 our devices to start more 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.250
 all devices to fit 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.619
 easy way as a referent we have the 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.750
 old video game cartridges except the 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.200
 processor that we will show shortly 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.850
 I will now show the 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.439
 of each computer element in the 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:22.720
 motherboard starting with the processor 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:29.920
 memory slot for mothers 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:35.230
 the express x16 x 1 x 1 pci slot 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:38.560
 this standard the input and output are 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:40.240
 usb and firewire connectors the 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.220
 system connectors 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.250
 the power connector on the motherboard 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.740
 also known as the power plus the 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.820
 cpu power connector and said 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.030
 to kurier 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.380
 and to finish the connectors of the 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.020
 additional sources 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.210
 knowing that the layout of the motherboards 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.050
 although the different ones are very 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.450
 look alike 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.550
 so that your motherboard is 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.670
 different it will keep countless 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.960
 similarities with this 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.790
 now let's get our hands on the dough and 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.310
 started to build a pc 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:14.290
 from the beginning there is a 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:18.970
 indication of how you should place the 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:23.830
 researcher observes in rhone fits 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:28.490
 basket and close 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:30.470
 now let's install the embedded memories 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.920
 them is easy as the old tapes 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:36.920
 Video - simply fit and press and 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.800
 you'll hear a clip in the batch box 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:43.870
 the same color and looked more memory 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.870
 access our video is on tomorrow 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.730
 now we will prepare the cabinet for 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.010
 receive the board but it is important to place 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.230
 this finish before we put the 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.280
 motherboard because it is impossible to place 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.280
 after installed 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:16.430
 now we will put the screws in the 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:19.700
 exact location of flowering this motherboard is 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:24.670
 and that your capello motherboard is only 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.670
 compare counting and screwing 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:35.319
 base screw fitting 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.319
 we will be the motherboard 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:43.360
 tightly closed open 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.360
 to run away 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:07.670
 now let's put the source 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:10.090
 the inside fitting was going to run away 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.090
 out 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:25.880
 Now let's install the warm clothes. 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:28.400
 the slot in the bar of your case and 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.870
 leave the connectors to the end 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.570
 if you want to know more about water and 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.410
 let me see our video how to install 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.300
 of the organism 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:39.590
 there you will know about the difference 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:42.010
 know and put them in raid among others 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.010
 things 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:50.640
 now let's install the card reader 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:53.220
 memory and the dvd drive 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:55.740
 note that both borrowed from outside 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.650
 for damage with the connector cables to 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:01.170
 inside the mine as well as the defenders 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:04.070
 let's fit the cables 

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:04.070
 at the end of the process 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:20.130
 now show the cpu colleague is 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:22.290
 a small pressure required for the 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:24.270
 to fit the body 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:27.450
 dock right you'll hear a 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.860
 small click on the procedure has 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:32.490
 just be careful not to touch the 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:34.650
 paste that is the material that optimizes 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:38.070
 processor heat transfer 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:43.970
 to the cooler and in the end do not forget 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:43.970
 to connect the planet's power cable 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.560
 now he's just there a fan o 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:54.050
 similar procedure for the majority of 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.050
 63 close to each other from a pc 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:59.070
 this accessory allows you to connect your 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:01.170
 own mother with her cabinet 

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:03.270
 if you do not connected right you will not 

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:04.740
 for example connect from the 3rd 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:07.500
 power squad 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:09.540
 the game as a reserve is it also that 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:12.510
 enables blinking 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:16.920
 access to the grid that is the connector 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:21.170
 entrance and sack and usb showed that 

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:21.170
 we have compare the pins to fit 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:31.730
 last we have legal and pt devices 

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:31.730
 ex ex 1 the main video card 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:41.610
 in my specific case a second plate 

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:47.720
 for the purposes of nvidia and finally a 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:47.720
 card or area but send n in the pci slot m 

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:56.910
 after assembling the whole computer is just 

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:59.940
 start to fit the cars 

00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:00.510
 first let's remove the fx cable from the board 

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:05.220
 mom 

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:15.270
 observe figure 1 and observe where we will go 

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:21.440
 connect it now the cpu connector looks 

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:21.440
 the figure and the place of fitting started 

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:33.360
 there are numerous other cables such as 

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:37.710
 SATA power and drive for ages 

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:40.410
 hard dvd general and tegra connectors 

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:43.620
 six pins and eight pins for 

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:47.850
 video and also a young man of four 

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:51.810
 feathers for the old dvd drives and 

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:54.870
 see how easy it is to watch 

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:56.400
 our other video and practice it 

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:59.060
 your story 

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:59.060
 hug
