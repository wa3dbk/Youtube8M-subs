00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
this for um like dressy occasions so

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.020 
this for um like dressy occasions so
it's<00:03:47.810> kind<00:03:47.989> of<00:03:48.019> different<00:03:48.230> but<00:03:48.560> um<00:03:48.799> I<00:03:49.129> like<00:03:49.819> it

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
it's kind of different but um I like it

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.910 
it's kind of different but um I like it
probably<00:03:50.810> will<00:03:51.170> end<00:03:51.319> up<00:03:51.380> doing<00:03:51.410> another<00:03:51.739> one

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
probably will end up doing another one

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.500 
probably will end up doing another one
because<00:03:51.980> it<00:03:52.190> actually<00:03:52.819> like<00:03:53.060> the<00:03:53.150> result<00:03:53.420> of

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
because it actually like the result of

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.129 
because it actually like the result of
this<00:03:53.630> one<00:03:53.840> so<00:03:54.500> um<00:03:55.150> yeah<00:03:56.150> I<00:03:56.180> just<00:03:56.269> wanted<00:03:56.660> to<00:03:56.690> do

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
that look like again and I couldn't left

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.550 
that look like again and I couldn't left
the<00:04:06.500> twist<00:04:06.769> on<00:04:07.010> me<00:04:08.109> because<00:04:09.109> I'm<00:04:09.349> going<00:04:09.500> to

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
the twist on me because I'm going to

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.740 
the twist on me because I'm going to
wedding<00:04:09.829> I<00:04:09.920> was<00:04:10.060> dressy<00:04:11.060> I<00:04:11.150> wanted<00:04:11.450> to<00:04:11.569> arm

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
wedding I was dressy I wanted to arm

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.900 
wedding I was dressy I wanted to arm
more<00:04:12.680> dramatic<00:04:13.130> look<00:04:13.160> but<00:04:13.459> if<00:04:13.549> I<00:04:13.639> was<00:04:13.790> like

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
more dramatic look but if I was like

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.339 
more dramatic look but if I was like
everyday<00:04:14.450> look<00:04:14.690> I<00:04:14.750> probably<00:04:14.900> wouldn't<00:04:15.260> split

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:15.349 
everyday look I probably wouldn't split

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:16.360 
everyday look I probably wouldn't split
it<00:04:15.530> this<00:04:15.650> much<00:04:15.829> because<00:04:16.039> this<00:04:16.130> is<00:04:16.220> probably

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
it this much because this is probably

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.270 
it this much because this is probably
gonna<00:04:16.549> freeze<00:04:16.700> up<00:04:16.880> faster<00:04:17.299> if<00:04:17.419> I<00:04:17.479> wouldn't

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
gonna freeze up faster if I wouldn't

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:24.370 
gonna freeze up faster if I wouldn't
have<00:04:20.229> what<00:04:21.229> it<00:04:21.320> is<00:04:21.410> much<00:04:21.590> but<00:04:22.930> you<00:04:23.930> know<00:04:24.050> for<00:04:24.349> a

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380
