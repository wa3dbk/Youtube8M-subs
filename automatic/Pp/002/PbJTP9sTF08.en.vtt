00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:11.100 
this Dwain of real fix is real fast calm

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.830 
this Dwain of real fix is real fast calm
today<00:00:12.100> we're<00:00:12.309> working<00:00:12.430> on<00:00:12.700> a<00:00:12.760> 2000<00:00:13.480> Nissan

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:13.840 
today we're working on a 2000 Nissan

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.260 
today we're working on a 2000 Nissan
Quest<00:00:14.110> and<00:00:14.589> it<00:00:15.219> came<00:00:15.429> over<00:00:15.700> to<00:00:15.790> the<00:00:15.879> complaint

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:16.270 
Quest and it came over to the complaint

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.019 
Quest and it came over to the complaint
that<00:00:16.480> around<00:00:16.869> 1500<00:00:17.650> rpm<00:00:18.130> and<00:00:18.310> was<00:00:18.460> chugging<00:00:18.730> or

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:19.029 
that around 1500 rpm and was chugging or

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:21.900 
that around 1500 rpm and was chugging or
not<00:00:19.210> having<00:00:19.540> any<00:00:19.990> power<00:00:20.290> as<00:00:20.619> we<00:00:21.310> were<00:00:21.460> working

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:21.910 
not having any power as we were working

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.359 
not having any power as we were working
on<00:00:22.090> it<00:00:22.269> it<00:00:22.449> would<00:00:23.170> do<00:00:23.410> that<00:00:23.650> it<00:00:24.070> would<00:00:24.189> almost

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:24.369 
on it it would do that it would almost

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:26.130 
on it it would do that it would almost
feel<00:00:24.580> like<00:00:24.880> a<00:00:24.910> misfire<00:00:25.449> something's<00:00:25.960> missing

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.140 
feel like a misfire something's missing

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.320 
feel like a misfire something's missing
but<00:00:26.890> right<00:00:27.099> now<00:00:27.279> it's<00:00:27.490> actually<00:00:27.820> developed

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:28.330 
but right now it's actually developed

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.620 
but right now it's actually developed
into<00:00:28.720> a<00:00:28.750> know<00:00:29.019> start<00:00:29.730> we<00:00:30.730> use<00:00:30.910> the<00:00:31.060> scanner<00:00:31.359> and

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:31.630 
into a know start we use the scanner and

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.150 
into a know start we use the scanner and
got<00:00:31.750> a<00:00:31.779> code<00:00:32.080> out<00:00:32.290> for<00:00:32.590> a<00:00:32.619> crank<00:00:32.949> sensor

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:33.160 
got a code out for a crank sensor

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.430 
got a code out for a crank sensor
problem<00:00:33.790> so<00:00:34.480> what<00:00:34.660> we're<00:00:34.780> going<00:00:34.900> to<00:00:34.960> do<00:00:35.080> is<00:00:35.199> tap

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
problem so what we're going to do is tap

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.930 
problem so what we're going to do is tap
into<00:00:35.710> the<00:00:35.800> crank<00:00:36.040> sensor<00:00:36.250> and<00:00:36.550> see<00:00:36.760> what's

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
into the crank sensor and see what's

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.540 
into the crank sensor and see what's
going<00:00:37.210> on<00:00:37.360> inside<00:00:38.350> the<00:00:38.710> cam<00:00:38.920> sensor<00:00:39.250> you're

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
going on inside the cam sensor you're

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.340 
going on inside the cam sensor you're
going<00:00:39.760> to<00:00:39.820> see<00:00:40.059> that<00:00:40.510> there's<00:00:40.750> a<00:00:40.809> one<00:00:41.170> degree

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
going to see that there's a one degree

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.490 
going to see that there's a one degree
and<00:00:41.800> 120<00:00:42.730> degree<00:00:43.059> signal<00:00:43.510> sent<00:00:43.780> to<00:00:43.809> the<00:00:43.989> PCM

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
and 120 degree signal sent to the PCM

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.310 
and 120 degree signal sent to the PCM
and<00:00:44.760> then<00:00:45.760> the<00:00:45.910> crank<00:00:46.180> sensor<00:00:46.420> which<00:00:47.020> is<00:00:47.170> on

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
and then the crank sensor which is on

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.709 
and then the crank sensor which is on
the<00:00:47.440> other<00:00:47.559> side<00:00:47.860> of<00:00:47.890> the<00:00:48.129> engine<00:00:48.489> is<00:00:48.940> used<00:00:49.360> to

00:00:49.709 --> 00:00:49.719 
the other side of the engine is used to

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:53.160 
the other side of the engine is used to
reference<00:00:50.200> the<00:00:50.770> cogs<00:00:51.070> on<00:00:51.370> the<00:00:51.460> flywheel<00:00:52.170> so

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
reference the cogs on the flywheel so

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.750 
reference the cogs on the flywheel so
we've<00:00:53.350> tapped<00:00:53.590> our<00:00:53.800> yellow<00:00:54.039> wire<00:00:54.129> into<00:00:54.670> the

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
we've tapped our yellow wire into the

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.160 
we've tapped our yellow wire into the
crank<00:00:55.000> sensor<00:00:55.270> which<00:00:55.570> is<00:00:55.600> down<00:00:55.930> by<00:00:56.110> the

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
crank sensor which is down by the

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.270 
crank sensor which is down by the
flywheel<00:00:56.739> and<00:00:57.059> over<00:00:58.059> at<00:00:58.180> the<00:00:58.210> distributor

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
flywheel and over at the distributor

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.010 
flywheel and over at the distributor
we've<00:01:00.280> tapped<00:01:00.579> into<00:01:00.850> the<00:01:01.090> signal<00:01:01.449> wire<00:01:01.629> over

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020 
we've tapped into the signal wire over

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.350 
we've tapped into the signal wire over
here<00:01:02.289> we're<00:01:02.920> into<00:01:03.219> the<00:01:03.399> one<00:01:03.850> degree<00:01:04.180> in<00:01:04.300> the

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
here we're into the one degree in the

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.570 
here we're into the one degree in the
120<00:01:05.019> degree<00:01:05.170> signal<00:01:05.800> and<00:01:05.979> they're<00:01:06.460> all

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
120 degree signal and they're all

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.020 
120 degree signal and they're all
champion<00:01:07.119> going<00:01:07.390> to<00:01:07.539> our<00:01:07.630> lab<00:01:07.810> scope<00:01:08.880> so<00:01:09.880> we're

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
champion going to our lab scope so we're

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.850 
champion going to our lab scope so we're
all<00:01:10.149> hooked<00:01:10.300> up<00:01:10.479> to<00:01:10.660> the<00:01:10.750> cam<00:01:10.929> sensor<00:01:11.259> tapped

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
all hooked up to the cam sensor tapped

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.499 
all hooked up to the cam sensor tapped
into<00:01:12.099> the<00:01:12.220> lab<00:01:12.369> scope<00:01:12.670> we're<00:01:13.209> going<00:01:13.360> to<00:01:13.420> use

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:13.509 
into the lab scope we're going to use

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:15.359 
into the lab scope we're going to use
the<00:01:13.599> K<00:01:13.780> twist<00:01:14.110> so<00:01:14.289> I<00:01:14.349> can<00:01:14.530> start<00:01:14.800> the<00:01:14.860> car<00:01:15.160> from

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
the K twist so I can start the car from

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:17.309 
the K twist so I can start the car from
out<00:01:15.490> underneath<00:01:15.849> the<00:01:15.940> hood<00:01:16.209> and<00:01:16.569> watch<00:01:17.140> our

00:01:17.309 --> 00:01:17.319 
out underneath the hood and watch our

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:30.530 
out underneath the hood and watch our
let's<00:01:17.530> go

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.370 

I'm<00:01:31.080> going<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.380> go<00:01:31.470> from<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.830> 10<00:01:32.040> milliseconds

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
I'm going to go from the 10 milliseconds

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.800 
I'm going to go from the 10 milliseconds
change<00:01:34.380> my<00:01:34.620> sweet<00:01:34.950> let's<00:01:35.850> go<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.390> 5

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
change my sweet let's go to the 5

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.149 
change my sweet let's go to the 5
seconds

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:44.679 

now<00:01:42.700> as<00:01:42.759> you<00:01:43.000> can<00:01:43.149> look

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
now as you can look

00:01:44.689 --> 00:02:03.830 
now as you can look
the<00:01:44.990> green<00:01:45.259> signal<00:01:45.530> very<00:01:46.040> erratic

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.230 

so<00:02:04.840> we<00:02:04.960> have<00:02:05.110> a<00:02:05.140> bad<00:02:05.409> signal<00:02:05.979> from<00:02:06.880> the<00:02:07.060> one

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
so we have a bad signal from the one

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.029 
so we have a bad signal from the one
degree<00:02:07.570> which<00:02:07.840> is<00:02:07.990> your<00:02:08.170> number<00:02:08.289> one<00:02:08.590> cylinder

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
degree which is your number one cylinder

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.000 
degree which is your number one cylinder
inside<00:02:09.940> the<00:02:10.420> camp<00:02:10.690> center<00:02:11.080> which<00:02:11.349> is<00:02:11.500> part<00:02:11.769> of

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
inside the camp center which is part of

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.459 
inside the camp center which is part of
the<00:02:12.130> distributor

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:16.469 

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:18.990 

so<00:02:17.469> we<00:02:17.590> need<00:02:17.739> to<00:02:17.829> shut<00:02:18.040> it<00:02:18.189> off<00:02:18.579> and<00:02:18.670> then

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
so we need to shut it off and then

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.009 
so we need to shut it off and then
change<00:02:19.239> our<00:02:19.450> distributor<00:02:21.659> now<00:02:22.659> we've<00:02:22.840> taken

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
change our distributor now we've taken

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:25.500 
change our distributor now we've taken
the<00:02:23.260> distributor<00:02:23.799> cap<00:02:23.829> off<00:02:24.280> so<00:02:25.090> before<00:02:25.390> we

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
the distributor cap off so before we

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.270 
the distributor cap off so before we
take<00:02:25.689> this<00:02:25.870> distributor<00:02:26.560> out<00:02:26.590> we<00:02:27.010> want<00:02:27.219> to

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
take this distributor out we want to

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.190 
take this distributor out we want to
identify<00:02:27.519> all<00:02:28.150> the<00:02:28.299> points<00:02:28.659> so<00:02:28.780> we<00:02:28.900> can<00:02:28.989> get<00:02:29.079> it

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
identify all the points so we can get it

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.860 
identify all the points so we can get it
back<00:02:29.290> in<00:02:29.500> the<00:02:29.560> right<00:02:29.709> place<00:02:30.659> right<00:02:31.659> where<00:02:31.719> that

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
back in the right place right where that

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.349 
back in the right place right where that
bolt<00:02:32.290> was<00:02:32.590> notice<00:02:33.129> where<00:02:33.340> that<00:02:33.519> SAP<00:02:36.359> where
