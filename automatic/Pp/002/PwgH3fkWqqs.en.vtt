00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.970
 hello everyone ends up in 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.710
 this new video to make you these 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:12.179
 two small rings fish glue based 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.330
 of resin for that I used a mold 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.799
 world 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.740
 I do not know what it's called 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:20.160
 and a ring holder 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:25.349
 these tools there the same as usual to 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:27.150
 each time translucent pasta so 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:31.230
 there I took the white and orange and al 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.820
 anwar basel to normal and then he 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.400
 there are plenty of little paws so the 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.530
 granite from the gray of the sarraz 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.680
 chocolate is a mix of green that I have 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.680
 made 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.519
 how did it start with the little fish 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.010
 we will mix the translucent colors 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:54.149
 with the dejection mix but not too much 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.370
 even though the colors are 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.989
 parents are not that they 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.980
 melt in the mass I did not pass 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.359
 very clear what I say no it was necessary 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.750
 we're still kicking 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.750
 three colours 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.900
 and since I have some explanations 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.490
 twisted I prefer to let you look 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.229
 how to make the little fish that will be 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.760
 maybe healthier than my little blah 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:17.760
 who says nothing 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.940
 Oh 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.620
 he 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.240
 he 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.740
 all 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.490
 e 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.740
 2 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.940
 so I'm doing exactly the same thing 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.940
 fish for the second wave 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.080
 all 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.280
 1 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.960
 that's what it gives for the moment and 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.700
 now we're going to decorate 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.920
 resumes some outputs we can call 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.290
 that way I'm going to use more 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.920
 granby than anything else but after that it's 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.920
 like you want 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.870
 then enjoys full collapse 

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:53.540
 small pieces that we will roll after a 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.709
 trick to make small stones I 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.519
 remember that I used color 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:04:00.969
 sahara granite gray and brown by 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:00.969
 chocolate pads 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.170
 I just apply the filmo liquid on 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:10.160
 the support of bad so that the 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.500
 small stones hold the most 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.090
 easily equivalent to school and I 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.870
 the wells have spoken one to one 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.870
 all around 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:47.600
 that's what it gives you for the 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.310
 moment then there I take my mold with 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.870
 the little fish feet you left me 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.490
 pledge letter takes to any piece that 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.680
 does the size of the mold I spread out of the 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.750
 flat granite spices cuts had 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.890
 the cookie cutter but the liquid fimo 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.890
 I put the little stones 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:16.470
 and I add small blades of grass 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.470
 for more greenery 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.360
 finally I check if everything is ok if all 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.860
 go well still go up 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.509
 things and then their name can pass 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.300
 to cooking and just after to air and 

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:34.639
 worthy so there since my good he is not 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.900
 very stable I decided to put us 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:36.770
 specified that peeled when opens for 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.289
 that there is a little more stable when 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.729
 even I put a fish upside down 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:42.620
 because we must not forget that suddenly 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:43.009
 it will end upside down I 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.509
 precise 

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:46.750
 I can not explain one of these 

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:46.750
 horrible 

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.090
 and for the ring stand it does not fit 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:55.220
 standing up rage and stuck in a ball 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:55.220
 of aluminum here we are at the age 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:26.580
 yes and so here we are the final result 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:28.939
 after drying 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:28.939
 12 

00:06:45.059 --> 00:06:49.419
 so for the mold I had a little 

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:50.529
 surprise when I place myself 

00:06:49.419 --> 00:06:53.009
 realized that people that if we 

00:06:50.529 --> 00:06:55.240
 had not been done 

00:06:53.009 --> 00:06:56.740
 that's why finally it's not 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:58.860
 serious so suddenly I added the 

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:00.759
 mokrane girl miz around to camouflage 

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:03.509
 the stupidity I made 

00:07:00.759 --> 00:07:03.509
 here 

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.800
 1 

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.870
 and so here is the tutorial is over 

00:07:23.669 --> 00:07:26.310
 I hope it reminded you 

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:30.050
 uchronies the zoo at all and I will 

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:30.050
 will give for a next video lease 

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.280
 Oh
