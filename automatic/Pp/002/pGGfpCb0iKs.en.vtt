00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 cellular respiration is a 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.759
 biochemical reaction that allows 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.450
 to get energy from that 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.220
 we eat 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.870
 in any case from glucose 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.219
 since there are other mechanisms that 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.710
 allow to get energy to 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.540
 from the degradation of proteins or 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.789
 of the goal of greece but for all 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.789
 foods that are digested in the form of 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:24.810
 glucose and well the final step is to 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.519
 turn this glucose into energy and that 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.519
 it takes place during the breath 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.640
 cell glucose I have it if the 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.340
 molecular structure with Hungary 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.980
 carbon atoms in red the atoms 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.320
 of oxygen and in white here the little ones 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.890
 hydrogen atoms so its formula 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.620
 chemical 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:50.070
 it's 6 carbon atoms for 12 atoms 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:53.399
 of hydrogen and 6 oxygen atom and in 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:58.199
 presence of oxygen so it takes six 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:00.680
 oxygen molecules to get six 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:05.430
 carbon dioxide molecules 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:09.240
 six molecules of water and this famous 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.799
 energy then you're going to say yes but 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.930
 the energy I was told it came from 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.290
 atp then yes the tp is the way 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.830
 whose energy is stored transferred by 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.450
 cells 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.689
 but what makes it possible to obtain 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.490
 the tp the source of energy to manufacture 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.720
 the tp she comes from this reaction of 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.400
 cellular respiration 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.750
 so if you want details here 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.689
 the energy produced 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:35.880
 it is disengaged partly in the form of 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:40.350
 heat and if the reaction is optimal 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.509
 it can get 38 atp so that 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.770
 it's theoretical 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.659
 if there is a return a little bit 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.670
 lesser of the reaction for a reason 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.040
 or another at this cell 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.869
 we can have something around 30 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.640
 atp but chemically it's the reaction 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.390
 is optimal we can hope to get 38 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.670
 atp 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.600
 the first step in the degradation of the 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.790
 glucose it's going to be glycolysis the 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.829
 glycolysis as its name indicated is 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.649
 well this is the case on a bed that wants 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.720
 say that sure as in hydrolysis of 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.550
 glucose so if I represent here the 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.880
 glucose only by its skeleton 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.700
 carbon is a game by draw 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:19.390
 the molecule that is cyclic I draw 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:22.570
 only the 6 carbon skeleton is 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.970
 well the glycolysis will come to break this 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:29.260
 molecule glucose to make two 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.800
 molecules to 3 atoms each and this 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:35.460
 reaction 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:39.970
 it requires it requires two atp 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:40.480
 and it produces 4 atp so the yield 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.150
 net 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.040
 it's going to be the production of 2 atp 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.430
 then these molecules get into a 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:54.280
 another reaction that is called the cycle of 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:57.040
 krebs the cycle of krebs which he also goes 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:00.310
 allow the production of again 2 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.020
 atp so we will see in detail the steps 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.030
 the chemical reactions that take place 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.420
 during the cycle of creps in another 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.160
 video 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.590
 this is really to give a view 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.260
 overview of what is happening and after 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.980
 the krebs cycle comes the chain 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:17.650
 respiratory the respiratory chain 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:20.890
 also called transport chain of 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.360
 electrons well that's where is going to be 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:26.580
 produces the bulk of energy that's where 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:30.910
 that moÃ«t released 34 atp 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:32.680
 so here are the three stages of the 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.020
 cellular respiration and you have to know 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.250
 so that the glycolysis part it does not 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.800
 requires no oxygen 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.790
 it can occur without oxygen and 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:46.600
 so we say it's anaerobic 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:49.030
 anaerobic since aerobics so must 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.610
 think for example the aero aerobics the 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.410
 sport aerobics aerobics gymnastics 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.610
 well, that's when we need to 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.160
 a lot breathes and well here it's the same 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.440
 needs a lot of oxygen for everything 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.840
 what is anaerobic aerobics what we 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:06.220
 does not need oxygen so glycolysis 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.780
 it's anaerobic and cycles of pep and 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:13.510
 respiratory chain we need 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:15.940
 of oxygen they say it's aerobics a 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.760
 aerobic reaction so in cases where 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.459
 precisely we do not have oxygen on 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.740
 can continue 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.990
 energy production from 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.780
 byproducts of glycolysis by 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:31.830
 other anaerobic reactions like the 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:35.310
 fermentation fermentation can 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.990
 continue to get energy and so 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.500
 some organizations like for example 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:42.990
 the yeasts will produce alcohol 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:45.960
 during the fermentation of glucose and 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.520
 other organisms will produce 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.120
 lactic acid like humans by 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:53.759
 example lactic acid is produced 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:56.250
 and that's why when we need 

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:58.110
 large amounts of energy from 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.539
 fast way and that our muscles have no 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.160
 no access to the necessary oxygen 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:03.630
 well, we're going to have pains 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.550
 muscle and that's lactic acid 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.520
 which is produced since at that moment 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.169
 we use fermentation to provide 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.970
 to the energy needs of the muscles so 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:14.039
 then just drink the earth from 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.180
 stretching to drain this active to 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:16.409
 these two lactic who who is who and what 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.509
 painful when he stays at the level of 

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:20.130
 muscles and otherwise a way 

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:22.259
 little unfair so we attribute all the 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:24.120
 credit here to the respiratory chain for 

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:27.509
 energy production there in form 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:29.759
 of atp but already during the glycolysis and 

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:34.110
 of the creps cycle well we have 

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:35.550
 transformation of hate to more 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:37.860
 will see in detail all that's right 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:40.409
 for not mentioning that it goes 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:45.270
 completely in oblivion the # 1 of 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:50.820
 more that is turned into a dh as well 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:54.419
 that the ffa dh that is turned into f &amp; a 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:56.729
 dh 2 who are also sources 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:59.550
 of energy that are used 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:01.889
 during the respiratory chain during the 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:04.469
 electron transfer to allow 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:06.750
 the production of these atp and therefore these 

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:08.719
 molecules are synthesized at the time of 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:11.699
 glycolysis and krebs cycle 

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:13.740
 so that's the overall idea the energy 

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:15.750
 necessary therefore to the body for 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:18.180
 to work well is the tp for 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:20.340
 get this atheist b well we need 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:22.320
 of cellular respiration that allows 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:24.509
 to degrade glucose in the presence 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.130
 of oxygen and extract the energy 

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:27.810
 we will now go into detail 

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:29.370
 to the chemical reactions that take place 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:31.669
 during the different stages of the 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:31.669
 breathing
