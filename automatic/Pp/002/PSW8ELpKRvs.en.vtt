as he did about you know the athletic
department<00:01:48.969> I<00:01:49.090> thought<00:01:49.329> that<00:01:49.450> was<00:01:49.570> wonderful

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869

I<00:01:50.020> just<00:01:50.229> like<00:01:50.409> you<00:01:50.619> know<00:01:50.740> talking<00:01:51.009> to<00:01:51.130> him<00:01:51.310> made

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
I just like you know talking to him made

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.669 
I just like you know talking to him made
a<00:01:52.060> genuine<00:01:52.509> that<00:01:52.689> this<00:01:52.869> is<00:01:53.020> what<00:01:53.229> Penn<00:01:53.439> State

00:01:53.669 --> 00:01:53.679 
a genuine that this is what Penn State

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:54.899 
a genuine that this is what Penn State
really<00:01:53.920> is<00:01:54.009> about<00:01:54.219> may<00:01:54.429> you<00:01:54.490> see<00:01:54.759> the

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
really is about may you see the

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:57.149 
really is about may you see the
statistics<00:01:55.090> of<00:01:55.630> the<00:01:55.689> graduation<00:01:56.380> rates<00:01:56.649> and<00:01:56.920> I

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
statistics of the graduation rates and I

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:58.679 
statistics of the graduation rates and I
mean<00:01:57.579> I<00:01:57.609> think<00:01:57.880> there's<00:01:58.030> only<00:01:58.210> one<00:01:58.659> other

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689 
mean I think there's only one other

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:01.260 
mean I think there's only one other
program<00:01:59.229> without<00:01:59.439> violations<00:02:00.310> at<00:02:00.549> Stanford

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
program without violations at Stanford

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.669 
program without violations at Stanford
and<00:02:01.390> its<00:02:01.630> really<00:02:01.840> importantly<00:02:02.319> I<00:02:02.409> think

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:02.679 
and its really importantly I think

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:04.889 
and its really importantly I think
anybody<00:02:03.100> knows<00:02:03.310> me<00:02:03.340> too<00:02:03.670> I<00:02:03.909> mean<00:02:04.569> if<00:02:04.659> I<00:02:04.750> went

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
anybody knows me too I mean if I went

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:06.959 
anybody knows me too I mean if I went
somewhere<00:02:05.289> where<00:02:05.469> we<00:02:05.649> were<00:02:05.729> pushing<00:02:06.729> the

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:06.969 
somewhere where we were pushing the

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:08.279 
somewhere where we were pushing the
envelope<00:02:07.030> and<00:02:07.450> doing<00:02:07.659> things<00:02:07.750> I<00:02:07.899> don't<00:02:07.929> I

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
envelope and doing things I don't I

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:09.690 
envelope and doing things I don't I
think<00:02:08.830> everybody<00:02:09.160> would<00:02:09.250> know<00:02:09.310> that's<00:02:09.580> not

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
think everybody would know that's not

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.550 
think everybody would know that's not
how<00:02:09.759> that's<00:02:10.420> not<00:02:10.539> how<00:02:10.660> I<00:02:10.780> work<00:02:10.989> so<00:02:11.290> I<00:02:11.470> think

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
how that's not how I work so I think

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.229 
how that's not how I work so I think
it's<00:02:11.860> a<00:02:11.920> great<00:02:12.069> fit<00:02:12.370> I'm<00:02:12.580> just<00:02:12.760> thrilled<00:02:12.970> to<00:02:13.120> be

it's a great fit I'm just thrilled to be

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:15.979 
it's a great fit I'm just thrilled to be
how<00:02:13.660> difficult<00:02:13.959> is<00:02:14.319> it<00:02:14.379> going<00:02:14.650> to<00:02:14.709> be<00:02:14.860> to<00:02:15.280> wait

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
how difficult is it going to be to wait

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.300 
how difficult is it going to be to wait
for<00:02:16.989> the<00:02:17.019> actual<00:02:17.440> competition<00:02:17.860> I<00:02:18.250> know
