keep<00:01:22.350> adjusting<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:23.340> renaming<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.090> weapon

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
keep adjusting and renaming the weapon

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.539

if you miss a few shots is still exactly

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.399 
if you miss a few shots is still exactly
where<00:01:27.180> you<00:01:27.270> aim<00:01:27.420> this<00:01:27.600> all<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:27.930> have<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.170> do<00:01:28.290> is

where you aim this all you have to do is

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.380 
where you aim this all you have to do is
probably<00:01:28.619> just<00:01:28.799> move<00:01:29.400> your<00:01:29.549> aiming<00:01:30.060> stick

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
have a really good trigger finger and

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.910 
have a really good trigger finger and
good<00:03:45.150> aim<00:03:45.329> all<00:03:45.630> at<00:03:45.810> the<00:03:45.930> same<00:03:46.079> time<00:03:46.139> because<00:03:46.769> I

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
good aim all at the same time because I

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.830 
good aim all at the same time because I
me<00:03:47.250> I<00:03:47.280> think<00:03:47.670> personally<00:03:48.180> that<00:03:48.299> I<00:03:48.450> have<00:03:48.600> pretty

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
me I think personally that I have pretty

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.990 
me I think personally that I have pretty
the<00:03:49.049> same<00:03:49.290> when<00:03:49.889> I'm<00:03:49.980> locking<00:03:50.220> on<00:03:50.489> to<00:03:50.639> someone

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
the same when I'm locking on to someone

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.160 
the same when I'm locking on to someone
and<00:03:51.209> I'm<00:03:51.299> trying<00:03:51.510> to<00:03:51.600> use<00:03:51.690> a<00:03:51.720> weapon<00:03:51.840> that

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
and I'm trying to use a weapon that

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.020 
and I'm trying to use a weapon that
requires<00:03:52.560> a<00:03:52.739> really<00:03:53.250> good<00:03:53.370> trigger<00:03:53.579> finger<00:03:53.880> I

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
requires a really good trigger finger I

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.490 
requires a really good trigger finger I
think<00:03:54.389> it's<00:03:54.480> really<00:03:54.720> hard<00:03:54.870> for<00:03:54.930> me<00:03:55.049> to<00:03:55.260> lock

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
think it's really hard for me to lock

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.740 
think it's really hard for me to lock
onto<00:03:55.709> them<00:03:56.040> and<00:03:56.069> then<00:03:56.760> use<00:03:57.209> my<00:03:57.389> trigger<00:03:57.600> finger

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
onto them and then use my trigger finger

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.020 
onto them and then use my trigger finger
all<00:03:58.019> at<00:03:58.170> one<00:03:58.319> time<00:03:58.350> so<00:03:59.069> just<00:03:59.430> try<00:03:59.609> to<00:03:59.639> keep<00:03:59.880> that

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
all at one time so just try to keep that

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.699 
all at one time so just try to keep that
in<00:04:00.180> mind<00:04:00.329> keep<00:04:00.569> all<00:04:00.720> your<00:04:00.750> engagements<00:04:01.410> medium

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
to long range and that's why I just

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.520 
to long range and that's why I just
stayed<00:04:03.299> around<00:04:03.420> here<00:04:03.780> this<00:04:03.959> is<00:04:04.109> like<00:04:04.260> I<00:04:04.350> said
