00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.330 
look at this incredible island it's
actually<00:02:00.420> about<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.840> size<00:02:01.020> of<00:02:01.259> Hawaii<00:02:01.590> it's

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
actually about the size of Hawaii it's

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.069 
actually about the size of Hawaii it's
one<00:02:02.640> of<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.820> largest<00:02:03.090> islands<00:02:03.689> that<00:02:03.869> we've

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
one of the largest islands that we've

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.620 
one of the largest islands that we've
ever<00:02:04.320> put<00:02:04.619> into<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:04.890> home<00:02:05.100> typically<00:02:06.090> an<00:02:06.270> island

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
ever put into a home typically an island

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.479 
ever put into a home typically an island
becomes<00:02:06.869> a<00:02:06.990> centerpiece<00:02:07.290> during<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:08.039> party<00:02:08.399> in

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
becomes a centerpiece during a party in

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.029 
becomes a centerpiece during a party in
a<00:02:08.550> house<00:02:08.729> so<00:02:09.450> we<00:02:10.170> wanted<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.530> make<00:02:10.679> this<00:02:10.830> space

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
a house so we wanted to make this space

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.830 
a house so we wanted to make this space
incredibly<00:02:11.670> large<00:02:11.910> so<00:02:12.390> it<00:02:12.510> was

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
incredibly large so it was

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.589 
incredibly large so it was
rumi<00:02:13.319> it's<00:02:13.590> a<00:02:13.800> curved<00:02:14.190> linear<00:02:14.640> shape<00:02:15.060> meaning

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
rumi it's a curved linear shape meaning

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.110 
rumi it's a curved linear shape meaning
that<00:02:15.720> this<00:02:16.440> area<00:02:16.890> of<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.220> island<00:02:17.489> is<00:02:17.849> curved

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
that this area of the island is curved

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.970 
that this area of the island is curved
the<00:02:18.300> back<00:02:18.569> section<00:02:19.050> is<00:02:19.140> curved<00:02:19.440> and<00:02:19.590> this<00:02:19.739> part

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
the back section is curved and this part

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.880 
the back section is curved and this part
is<00:02:20.099> straight<00:02:20.340> but<00:02:20.970> this<00:02:21.180> actual<00:02:21.690> island<00:02:22.140> is<00:02:22.620> so

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
is straight but this actual island is so

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.589 
is straight but this actual island is so
large<00:02:23.160> that<00:02:23.370> it<00:02:23.849> had<00:02:24.000> to<00:02:24.120> be<00:02:24.239> framed

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
large that it had to be framed

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.300 
large that it had to be framed
conventionally<00:02:25.500> as<00:02:25.620> if<00:02:25.769> you<00:02:25.860> were<00:02:25.950> a<00:02:25.980> frame<00:02:26.280> a

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
conventionally as if you were a frame a

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.100 
conventionally as if you were a frame a
house<00:02:26.670> so<00:02:27.180> it's<00:02:27.330> all<00:02:27.480> structurally

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
house so it's all structurally

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.259 
house so it's all structurally
engineered<00:02:28.200> to<00:02:28.650> be<00:02:28.800> totally<00:02:29.670> strong<00:02:29.970> to

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
engineered to be totally strong to

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:32.720 
engineered to be totally strong to
support<00:02:30.690> several<00:02:31.410> people<00:02:31.890> walking<00:02:32.310> on<00:02:32.430> it<00:02:32.610> or

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
support several people walking on it or

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.190 
support several people walking on it or
dancing<00:02:33.209> on<00:02:33.360> it<00:02:33.390> or<00:02:33.599> whatever<00:02:33.750> you<00:02:33.959> want<00:02:34.110> to

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
dancing on it or whatever you want to

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.400 
dancing on it or whatever you want to
call<00:02:34.319> it<00:02:35.360> one<00:02:36.360> thing<00:02:36.569> that<00:02:36.750> I<00:02:36.780> really<00:02:37.230> don't

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
call it one thing that I really don't

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.710 
call it one thing that I really don't
like<00:02:37.620> or<00:02:38.010> homes<00:02:38.340> that<00:02:38.790> are<00:02:38.910> divided<00:02:39.330> up<00:02:39.450> with

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
like or homes that are divided up with

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.080 
like or homes that are divided up with
walls<00:02:39.989> and<00:02:40.379> all<00:02:41.099> kinds<00:02:41.640> of<00:02:41.730> things<00:02:41.970> that

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
walls and all kinds of things that

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.330 
walls and all kinds of things that
create<00:02:42.660> barriers<00:02:42.959> so<00:02:43.379> what<00:02:43.530> I<00:02:43.560> decided<00:02:43.980> to<00:02:44.129> do

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
create barriers so what I decided to do

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.520 
create barriers so what I decided to do
here<00:02:44.549> was<00:02:44.700> design<00:02:45.090> this<00:02:45.329> to<00:02:45.540> work<00:02:45.690> the<00:02:46.319> kitchen

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
here was design this to work the kitchen

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.589 
here was design this to work the kitchen
actually<00:02:46.890> becomes<00:02:47.400> open<00:02:47.849> to<00:02:48.000> all<00:02:48.150> these<00:02:48.360> main

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
actually becomes open to all these main

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:52.569 
actually becomes open to all these main
areas<00:02:49.110> meaning<00:02:49.860> that<00:02:50.130> the<00:02:50.730> great<00:02:51.420> room<00:02:51.750> the

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:52.579 
areas meaning that the great room the

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:54.979 
areas meaning that the great room the
casual<00:02:53.579> breakfast<00:02:54.000> area<00:02:54.299> the<00:02:54.450> dining<00:02:54.630> room

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
casual breakfast area the dining room

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.600 
casual breakfast area the dining room
the<00:02:55.140> water<00:02:55.349> feature<00:02:55.650> this<00:02:55.950> all<00:02:56.130> becomes<00:02:56.489> one

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
the water feature this all becomes one

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.180 
the water feature this all becomes one
dynamic<00:02:57.390> room<00:02:57.629> so<00:02:58.379> if<00:02:58.500> you<00:02:58.620> notice<00:02:58.980> we

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
dynamic room so if you notice we

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.520 
dynamic room so if you notice we
actually<00:02:59.220> have<00:02:59.819> two<00:03:00.269> separate<00:03:00.870> dining<00:03:01.079> areas

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
actually have two separate dining areas

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.190 
actually have two separate dining areas
this<00:03:01.650> one<00:03:01.920> is<00:03:02.099> the<00:03:02.250> casual<00:03:02.790> dining<00:03:03.000> area<00:03:03.540> which

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
this one is the casual dining area which

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.740 
this one is the casual dining area which
we<00:03:04.440> wanted<00:03:04.829> to<00:03:04.980> have<00:03:05.280> close<00:03:05.970> up<00:03:06.209> to<00:03:06.360> the<00:03:06.450> window

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
we wanted to have close up to the window

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.720 
we wanted to have close up to the window
although<00:03:07.379> this<00:03:07.560> is<00:03:07.709> a<00:03:07.739> great<00:03:08.069> eating<00:03:08.489> space

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
although this is a great eating space

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.550 
although this is a great eating space
wait<00:03:09.450> till<00:03:09.629> you<00:03:09.690> see<00:03:09.900> this<00:03:11.180> over<00:03:12.180> here<00:03:12.750> we<00:03:13.379> have

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
wait till you see this over here we have

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.440 
wait till you see this over here we have
the<00:03:13.769> formal<00:03:14.220> dining<00:03:14.430> room<00:03:14.670> and<00:03:15.180> we<00:03:15.269> actually

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
the formal dining room and we actually

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.949 
the formal dining room and we actually
designed<00:03:16.110> it<00:03:16.349> to<00:03:16.379> be<00:03:17.100> surrounded<00:03:17.940> by<00:03:18.269> this

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
designed it to be surrounded by this

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.620 
designed it to be surrounded by this
water<00:03:19.260> feature<00:03:19.609> which<00:03:20.609> gives<00:03:21.000> the

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 
to spin in a clockwise motion which

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.470 
to spin in a clockwise motion which
creates<00:03:57.440> a<00:03:57.590> vortex<00:03:58.069> to<00:03:58.400> bring<00:03:59.000> that<00:03:59.180> type<00:03:59.420> of

feature here this artistic feature and

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.060 
feature here this artistic feature and
it's<00:04:25.280> all<00:04:25.430> backlit<00:04:25.810> so<00:04:26.810> at<00:04:27.260> night<00:04:27.500> the<00:04:27.889> whole

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
it's all backlit so at night the whole

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.159 
it's all backlit so at night the whole
wall<00:04:28.340> glows<00:04:28.789> and<00:04:29.150> it<00:04:29.270> glows<00:04:29.449> from<00:04:29.720> the<00:04:29.810> inside

wall glows and it glows from the inside
to<00:04:30.350> the<00:04:30.440> outside<00:04:30.590> as<00:04:31.070> well<00:04:31.210> just<00:04:32.210> when<00:04:32.389> you

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
to the outside as well just when you

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.629 
to the outside as well just when you
thought<00:04:32.720> that<00:04:32.990> this<00:04:33.110> room<00:04:33.410> couldn't<00:04:34.310> get<00:04:34.490> any

bigger<00:04:34.880> take<00:04:35.600> a<00:04:35.630> look<00:04:35.840> at<00:04:35.960> this<00:04:36.110> I<00:04:36.380> actually

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
bigger take a look at this I actually

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.820 
bigger take a look at this I actually
decided<00:04:37.130> to<00:04:37.430> install<00:04:38.090> these<00:04:38.470> massive<00:04:39.470> glass

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
decided to install these massive glass

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.560 
decided to install these massive glass
sliders<00:04:40.430> and<00:04:40.610> these<00:04:40.699> are<00:04:40.850> actually<00:04:41.210> twelve

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
sliders and these are actually twelve

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.390 
sliders and these are actually twelve
feet<00:04:41.840> tall<00:04:41.900> which<00:04:42.440> is<00:04:42.470> about<00:04:42.800> the<00:04:42.919> biggest<00:04:43.130> you

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
feet tall which is about the biggest you

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.879 
feet tall which is about the biggest you
can<00:04:43.490> get<00:04:43.580> a<00:04:43.610> sheet<00:04:43.850> of<00:04:43.970> glass<00:04:44.680> basically<00:04:45.680> each

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:45.889 
can get a sheet of glass basically each

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:48.129 
can get a sheet of glass basically each
one<00:04:46.070> of<00:04:46.160> these<00:04:46.250> doors<00:04:46.550> open<00:04:47.330> over<00:04:47.930> one<00:04:48.110> another

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:48.139 
one of these doors open over one another

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:51.250 
one of these doors open over one another
and<00:04:48.770> they<00:04:49.250> actually<00:04:49.599> recess<00:04:50.599> completely

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260 
and they actually recess completely

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.230 
and they actually recess completely
behind<00:04:51.440> the<00:04:51.740> wall<00:04:51.950> so<00:04:52.280> this<00:04:52.460> space<00:04:52.729> becomes

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
behind the wall so this space becomes

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.900 
behind the wall so this space becomes
one<00:04:53.780> space<00:04:54.169> meaning<00:04:54.560> the<00:04:54.830> great<00:04:55.070> room<00:04:55.370> and<00:04:55.610> the

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
one space meaning the great room and the

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.029 
one space meaning the great room and the
outdoors<00:04:56.300> now<00:04:56.539> become<00:04:56.960> the<00:04:57.139> same<00:04:57.349> space<00:04:57.710> that

00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:58.039 
outdoors now become the same space that

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:01.089 
outdoors now become the same space that
alone<00:04:58.880> between<00:04:59.180> the<00:04:59.660> actual<00:05:00.110> sliding<00:05:00.830> doors
