00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
um screen layers in the hair so the hair

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.270 
um screen layers in the hair so the hair

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
is like short here and then it slowly

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.859 
is like short here and then it slowly
gets<00:01:50.700> all<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:50.939> way<00:01:51.060> around<00:01:51.299> so<00:01:51.509> we're<00:01:51.750> making

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
gets all the way around so we're making

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.289 
gets all the way around so we're making
the<00:01:52.290> hair<00:01:52.530> as<00:01:53.189> you<00:01:53.399> can<00:01:53.549> see<00:01:53.700> with<00:01:53.820> my<00:01:54.000> head

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
the hair as you can see with my head

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.440 
the hair as you can see with my head
it's<00:01:55.020> like<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:56.100> layer<00:01:56.460> so<00:01:56.759> it's<00:01:56.909> like<00:01:57.090> short

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
it's like the layer so it's like short

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.539 
it's like the layer so it's like short
and<00:01:57.630> then<00:01:57.869> goes<00:01:58.049> longer<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.710> that's<00:01:59.369> what

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
and then goes longer and that's what

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
you have to look like this and then

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.150 
you have to look like this and then
again<00:04:13.640> whether<00:04:14.030> you<00:04:14.150> make<00:04:14.330> the<00:04:14.510> line<00:04:15.070> at<00:04:16.070> the

again whether you make the line at the
head<00:04:16.310> up<00:04:16.430> as<00:04:16.670> you<00:04:16.820> can<00:04:16.940> see<00:04:17.090> you<00:04:17.600> make<00:04:17.780> the<00:04:17.900> line

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.080 
head up as you can see you make the line

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.460 
head up as you can see you make the line
from<00:04:18.410> the<00:04:18.470> top<00:04:18.830> all<00:04:19.190> the<00:04:19.250> way<00:04:19.580> down<00:04:19.989> then<00:04:20.989> you

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
from the top all the way down then you

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.290 
from the top all the way down then you
make<00:04:21.650> another<00:04:21.919> line<00:04:22.100> here<00:04:22.160> and<00:04:22.700> then<00:04:23.060> you<00:04:23.150> make

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
make another line here and then you make

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.960 
make another line here and then you make
one<00:04:23.540> thing<00:04:24.020> they're<00:04:24.380> not

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970
