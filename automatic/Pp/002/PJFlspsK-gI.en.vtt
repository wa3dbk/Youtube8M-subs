00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hello everyone always by the way 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.640
 of the hot topic 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.990
 today I would like to face the legend 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.900
 subway 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.570
 about shearing or the fact that 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.730
 it is often thought to dose the canal 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.400
 in hot weather be for him a 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.920
 aid because it makes them feel more 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.900
 fresh all the time asked convinced 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.869
 there is always someone who looks at it with 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.170
 eye fans and tells me poor thing not 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.740
 it will be hot but why not find it 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.059
 but also the theme different functions 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.399
 first of all it constitutes a barrier 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.230
 physics for dirt pests 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.870
 preventing them from coming directly to 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.239
 skin contact and then all 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.399
 very important thermal insulation function 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.090
 therefore it helps to maintain the temperature 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.430
 body and the degree of isolation is 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.050
 directly proportional to the thickness 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.510
 of the hair 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.820
 there are also two all that 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.930
 that outside that longer than it works 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:04.080
 precisely from barrier and protects also from 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.360
 sun rays preventing sunburn and 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.500
 then the name below 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:14.460
 just shorter and softer undercoat e 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:17.220
 not all heat retains 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.960
 the breeds are equipped with an underweight and 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.580
 these fans basically shouldn't 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.320
 be left in the garden during 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.659
 cold season because they are not 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.189
 properly isolated what happens 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.740
 so when we bring our dog to 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.350
 to dare that we believe this fantastic 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.450
 protection of which naturally equipped 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.640
 first of all the dog is no longer fresh 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.400
 because it is no more isolated than 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.189
 paradoxically it can suffer the most 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.579
 hot and his skin is exposed to 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:47.399
 burns rashes due to sun rays 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.320
 rather than being kidnapped due also 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.110
 to the fact that dirt arrives more 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.240
 easily in contact with 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.670
 moreover if you cut it with the 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.610
 however, the machine remains a layer 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.980
 of dead themes that would be better instead 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.130
 remove because they do not allow anyway 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:08.590
 the skin to breathe 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.300
 furthermore hair in this way cut in 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.250
 this way out grow thicker 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.890
 bristly than before 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.900
 some dogs instead follow that one 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.320
 waterproof so we also remove you 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.480
 this fantastic protect our 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.480
 leather instead has a layer 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.630
 surface of dead cells that there 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.700
 they protect hunger by working in non-cheaters 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.130
 he has precisely while the dogs do not have 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.380
 this layer laces its own outside 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.140
 that you love for their skin 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.820
 exposed environment is much more delicate 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.850
 and sensitive of ours 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:46.810
 recapping the hair to the dog serves is 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:50.500
 necessary to keep it clean brushed for 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.510
 make sure that he remains healthy and in the 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.850
 in case there was a particularly hair 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.160
 difficult to go to the ferryman who 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:00.330
 he will think to untangle the knots a 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:03.100
 remove the skeins rather than ad 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.780
 shorten the hair of those dogs 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.739
 who are just constantly growing 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.840
 like tramps 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.830
 I hope I was helpful at 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.830
 next hello
