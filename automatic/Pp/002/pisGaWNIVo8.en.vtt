00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420
 r 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:12.580
 hands up this is a holdup 'no what 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.170
 I discard going putting your objects of 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.059
 value on the table in case it changed 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.520
 idea but for now it 's a tutorial 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.680
 about the tone curve of lightroom the 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.789
 objective of this tutorial 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.980
 fundamentally is to explain the 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:26.170
 difference between how to approach 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.269
 high white shades of black lights 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.429
 basic panel and how to do what 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:33.040
 same of the curved panel of tones that 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:35.320
 flame lights clear dark shadows but 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.390
 more or less it comes to be something similar not 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.970
 However as I say it is not at all a 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.940
 redundant panel tone curve respect 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.710
 Basic basic contains 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.750
 controls that from the version of the 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.880
 2012 process that appeared in light room 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.490
 four are smart which 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.920
 means that more than going to fixed gear 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:56.410
 They adapt a lot to the image we have and 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.090
 are informed internally of the adjustment 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.280
 that we have applied in the others 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.410
 controls that is me when I black bass 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.659
 is taking into account what adjustments I have 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.189
 done on the other parameters what 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.080
 happens is that this has the small 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:09.400
 disadvantage that normally is not 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.440
 disadvantage normally 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.960
 but it has the disadvantage that if I 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.940
 I want to take the blacks to the top I can not 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.770
 crush them beyond this point I can 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.600
 come to the shadows and still I have left 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.820
 here dark parts that are not of the 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.040
 all crushed if I want to take the 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.750
 pure white is all here because neither 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.580
 can I absolutely have to climb white 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.920
 the thing is that even with everything 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.140
 you will see that they are preserved 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.490
 quite the ranges of shades taking in 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.430
 account as I say I have come to 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.800
 maximum this I repeat is usually good 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.530
 but in some cases it may not be 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.630
 enough for what we want to do and 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.090
 it is in those cases where we can come 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.850
 phenomenally good to come to the curve of 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.890
 tones and use it to complement what 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.690
 that we have done in the basic panel the 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.330
 tone curve has two modes of 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.190
 operating the parametric mode in the 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.380
 which we simply adjust these 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.720
 parameters of which I will now speak and the 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.400
 traditional dot curve mode 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.869
 where we also have the three channels 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.660
 as soon as I will comment too 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.759
 starting with the parametric mode you will see 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.920
 that the curve is segmented into four 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.989
 pieces that I can redefine from here 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.319
 and in this way if I want to do more 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.079
 bright the high ones 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:20.749
 increase this or I can just come 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:22.189
 here and pull up and I've done it 

00:02:20.749 --> 00:02:23.329
 whiter if I want this range 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:25.340
 affected is greater 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:27.739
 I can move this little triangle and the same 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.139
 with the others as you see if you look at 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:32.510
 the curve this the only limitation that 

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:34.430
 has is that it has to connect well with the 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.379
 rest of the curve but does not have 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.389
 Considerations about the content of the 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:40.400
 image as the basic panel does 

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:43.370
 and it does not matter what you have set in 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.129
 the other parties if I go to the curve of 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.780
 points I'll have even more freedom this 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:50.180
 it's like the dot curve of 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.680
 photoshop but with osteoarthritis because the 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.620
 truth is that they have done it in a way 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.180
 that is very clumsy very slow very heavy 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.370
 move the point this is a bit 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.840
 unfriendly but good as I say you can 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.519
 do what we want for example 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.219
 I could even make the typical curve 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:07.010
 solar that will give me an effect 

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:08.870
 of doubtful utility in this case but that 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.109
 I could not get with any other 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.879
 right button lightroom control 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:15.230
 to return it to zero by the way 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:17.419
 than parametric mode with button 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.740
 right I can also choose if I want 

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:20.450
 restore it 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:23.180
 and visions here values or everything 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.250
 together I go back to point mode and here 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.870
 well, I could give you more contrast 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.300
 with a contrast curve or do what 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.370
 that I would like in the rgb mode as well as 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.080
 I mentioned before I have the possibility to go 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.250
 to color channels and their 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.600
 complementary 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.610
 that is to say the red has as 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.130
 complementary the cyan the green the 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:43.100
 magenta and blue the yellow therefore 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.990
 If I give you blue here, you can see the image 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.150
 more blue if I remove it blue it will look 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:49.610
 yellow because that is the complementary 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.470
 and if I do it by the ends over here 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.990
 for example this allows me to give 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.630
 yellow to the lights and this here I 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:59.210
 would allow to give blue to the shadows and 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:02.420
 get a pretty interesting effect 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:04.640
 If I wanted I was thinking now 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.440
 blue to the lights will surely 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.810
 I would find is that you do not notice almost anything 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.270
 this is because in rgb luminosity and 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.530
 color go hand in hand and then I would have 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:15.140
 that compensate for this increase in 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.230
 luminosity going down here so that it 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.820
 I saw him 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.920
 that is to say that this works like that a little 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.630
 as a whole but I'm going to leave the 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.120
 adjustment I had made before I 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.980
 I liked it a lot and it's incredibly 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.200
 complicated to get back because 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.720
 as I say these little dots are unfriendly 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.800
 of noses there is a little trick that 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.440
 I also wanted to explain that now 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.630
 I will mention and it is that if I want to 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.850
 example from rgb if I want to handle the 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.610
 points I put here one if I want to manage 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:44.190
 this with a little more precision I can 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:47.310
 hold the alt or option key and 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:49.080
 now it moves a lot slower with 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.900
 which I can have a little more of 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.730
 precision fine well this was what 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.350
 I wanted to explain in this video I hope that 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.690
 has clarified doubts about the 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.760
 operation of these parameters and without 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:02.540
 nothing more to say I say goodbye until the 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.540
 next video
