00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
screws facing upwards so when the carbs

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.600 
screws facing upwards so when the carbs
amount<00:00:37.469> is<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:37.710> can<00:00:37.860> get<00:00:37.980> your<00:00:38.070> screwdrivers

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
amount is you can get your screwdrivers

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.810 
amount is you can get your screwdrivers

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
see what I'm doing get a screwdriver in

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.410 
see what I'm doing get a screwdriver in
the<00:02:08.840> little<00:02:09.080> gap<00:02:09.590> of<00:02:09.799> there<00:02:10.039> and<00:02:11.030> if<00:02:11.150> you<00:02:11.239> just

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
the little gap of there and if you just

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.650 
the little gap of there and if you just
put<00:02:11.720> pull<00:02:12.049> it<00:02:12.170> back<00:02:12.349> like<00:02:12.530> that<00:02:12.769> push<00:02:13.760> on<00:02:14.510> the

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
put pull it back like that push on the

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
carb dam which keep the pressure held in

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.449 
carb dam which keep the pressure held in
do<00:02:18.290> the<00:02:18.410> same<00:02:18.650> the<00:02:18.829> other<00:02:18.860> side<00:02:18.950> and<00:02:19.220> sorry

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
do the same the other side and sorry

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:32.670 
do the same the other side and sorry
about<00:02:19.640> the<00:02:20.390> crappy<00:02:20.630> images<00:02:22.120> bit<00:02:23.120> my<00:02:23.269> turn<00:02:29.680> okay

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
about the crappy images bit my turn okay

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.710 
about the crappy images bit my turn okay
yeah<00:02:33.680> and<00:02:33.980> that's<00:02:34.489> how<00:02:34.640> long<00:02:34.849> it<00:02:35.120> takes<00:02:35.360> to<00:02:35.450> fit

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
yeah and that's how long it takes to fit

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.100 
yeah and that's how long it takes to fit
carbs<00:02:36.730> when<00:02:37.730> you<00:02:37.880> used<00:02:38.090> to<00:02:38.180> taking<00:02:38.420> off<00:02:38.660> five

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
carbs when you used to taking off five

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.830 
carbs when you used to taking off five
or<00:02:39.290> six<00:02:39.440> hundred<00:02:39.500> times

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
or six hundred times

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.600 
or six hundred times
then<00:02:41.840> there's<00:02:42.019> the<00:02:42.200> proof<00:02:43.160> within<00:02:43.489> the

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
then there's the proof within the

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:49.599 
then there's the proof within the
pudding<00:02:45.370> reseated<00:02:46.370> left-side<00:02:48.430> reseated<00:02:49.430> that

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:49.609 
pudding reseated left-side reseated that

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:51.340 
pudding reseated left-side reseated that
side<00:02:49.850> and<00:02:50.180> obviously<00:02:50.630> on<00:02:50.720> the<00:02:50.810> front<00:02:51.019> cause<00:02:51.230> it

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
side and obviously on the front cause it

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.450
