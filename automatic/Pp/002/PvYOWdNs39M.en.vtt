killing and so everyone's Pradesh feared

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.490 
killing and so everyone's Pradesh feared
by<00:01:13.520> her<00:01:13.759> because<00:01:14.090> well<00:01:14.300> she<00:01:14.509> can<00:01:14.690> kill<00:01:14.960> people

by her because well she can kill people

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.010 
by her because well she can kill people
let's<00:01:16.250> look<00:01:16.369> at<00:01:16.460> her<00:01:16.520> hand<00:01:16.759> and<00:01:17.030> she<00:01:17.690> decides

let's look at her hand and she decides

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.150 
let's look at her hand and she decides
that<00:01:18.080> she<00:01:18.229> doesn't<00:01:18.259> want<00:01:18.619> to<00:01:18.710> kill<00:01:18.860> anyone

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:19.160 
that she doesn't want to kill anyone

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.790 
that she doesn't want to kill anyone
anymore<00:01:19.610> and<00:01:19.880> so<00:01:20.180> she<00:01:20.240> takes<00:01:20.600> on<00:01:20.840> a<00:01:21.200> detective

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
anymore and so she takes on a detective

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.950 
anymore and so she takes on a detective
kind<00:01:22.009> of<00:01:22.130> role<00:01:22.400> and<00:01:22.700> unfurls<00:01:23.570> the<00:01:23.720> story

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
kind of role and unfurls the story

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.630 
kind of role and unfurls the story
further<00:01:24.200> but<00:01:24.590> it<00:01:24.800> has<00:01:24.950> a<00:01:24.979> really<00:01:25.220> good<00:01:25.340> range

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
further but it has a really good range

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.830 
further but it has a really good range
of<00:01:25.729> characters<00:01:26.150> which<00:01:26.330> is<00:01:26.360> one<00:01:26.630> of<00:01:26.720> reasons

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
of characters which is one of reasons

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.950 
of characters which is one of reasons
why<00:01:27.080> I<00:01:27.110> really<00:01:27.170> enjoyed<00:01:27.560> this<00:01:27.650> book

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
why I really enjoyed this book

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.630 
why I really enjoyed this book
so<00:01:29.440> the<00:01:29.560> book<00:01:29.710> in<00:01:29.800> eighth<00:01:30.010> place<00:01:30.280> is<00:01:30.520> probably

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
so the book in eighth place is probably

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.430 
so the book in eighth place is probably
more<00:01:30.940> well<00:01:31.090> known<00:01:31.270> for<00:01:31.510> her<00:01:31.600> striking<00:01:32.020> series

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
more well known for her striking series

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.070 
more well known for her striking series
but<00:01:32.950> it<00:01:33.190> is<00:01:33.400> the<00:01:33.580> younger<00:01:33.880> lips<00:01:34.090> by<00:01:34.270> Mary<00:01:34.600> Lu<00:01:34.840> I

saw<00:01:35.290> that<00:01:35.380> I've<00:01:35.470> read<00:01:35.650> in<00:01:35.680> this<00:01:35.830> book<00:01:35.890> and<00:01:36.220> I

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
saw that I've read in this book and I

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.650 
saw that I've read in this book and I
thought<00:01:36.550> that<00:01:36.760> it<00:01:36.880> is<00:01:37.000> very<00:01:37.240> similar<00:01:37.540> to

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
thought that it is very similar to

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.600 
thought that it is very similar to
shadow<00:01:37.930> and<00:01:38.170> bone<00:01:38.380> but<00:01:38.830> the<00:01:39.070> more<00:01:39.250> that<00:01:39.280> I<00:01:39.400> read

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
shadow and bone but the more that I read

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.550 
shadow and bone but the more that I read
it<00:01:39.730> the<00:01:39.910> more<00:01:40.120> it<00:01:40.300> kind<00:01:40.510> of<00:01:40.570> stood<00:01:40.750> out<00:01:40.930> for<00:01:41.440> me

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
it the more it kind of stood out for me

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.200 
it the more it kind of stood out for me
in<00:01:41.710> comparison<00:01:42.250> to<00:01:42.280> shadow<00:01:42.520> and<00:01:42.730> bone<00:01:42.940> I'm

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
in comparison to shadow and bone I'm

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.850 
in comparison to shadow and bone I'm
also<00:01:43.540> pretty<00:01:43.900> sure<00:01:44.020> that<00:01:44.410> it<00:01:44.560> has<00:01:44.710> been

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
also pretty sure that it has been

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.620 
also pretty sure that it has been
acquired<00:01:45.220> for<00:01:45.490> made<00:01:45.640> into<00:01:45.820> a<00:01:45.850> movie<00:01:46.150> so
