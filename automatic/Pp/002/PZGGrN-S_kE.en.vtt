00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
needs obviously is a computer which I

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.040 
needs obviously is a computer which I
have<00:00:13.590> there<00:00:13.940> and<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.929> gaming<00:00:16.350> keyboard<00:00:18.050> there

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
have there and the gaming keyboard there

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.019 
have there and the gaming keyboard there
is<00:00:19.080> a<00:00:19.199> r5<00:00:20.390> quad-core<00:00:21.390> something<00:00:21.930> like<00:00:22.020> at<00:00:23.029> 5-4

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
is a r5 quad-core something like at 5-4

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.630 
is a r5 quad-core something like at 5-4
processes<00:00:25.519> 3<00:00:26.519> gigahertz<00:00:26.820> whatever<00:00:27.779> that<00:00:27.960> is

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
processes 3 gigahertz whatever that is

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.240 
processes 3 gigahertz whatever that is
good<00:00:29.640> CPU<00:00:30.199> allows<00:00:31.199> me<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.529> run<00:00:31.619> large<00:00:31.800> plugins

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
good CPU allows me to run large plugins

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.180 
good CPU allows me to run large plugins
without<00:00:32.759> having<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.090> balance<00:00:33.239> too<00:00:33.540> much<00:00:33.690> down

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
without having to balance too much down

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.560 
without having to balance too much down
and<00:00:36.559> from<00:00:37.559> there<00:00:37.860> because<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.940> sound<00:00:39.210> cards

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
and from there because the sound cards

so<00:00:39.930> terrible<00:00:40.410> I<00:00:40.649> have<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.660> audio<00:00:42.660> interface<00:00:43.550> now

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
so terrible I have a audio interface now

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.090 
so terrible I have a audio interface now
that<00:00:45.239> is<00:00:45.980> a<00:00:46.980> five<00:00:47.430> studio<00:00:47.820> mobile<00:00:48.620> has<00:00:49.620> ten

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
that is a five studio mobile has ten

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.779 
that is a five studio mobile has ten
inputs<00:00:51.110> to<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.289> front<00:00:52.530> day<00:00:52.789> volume

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
inputs to the front day volume

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.840 
inputs to the front day volume
controlling<00:00:54.210> too<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.840> then<00:00:55.350> it's<00:00:55.530> got<00:00:55.730> six<00:00:56.730> at

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
controlling too and then it's got six at

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.910 
controlling too and then it's got six at
the<00:00:56.879> back<00:00:58.430> to<00:00:59.430> get<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.699> back<00:00:59.879> there<00:01:00.180> and

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
the back to get the back there and

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.780 
the back to get the back there and
another<00:01:01.920> two<00:01:02.190> over<00:01:03.149> here<00:01:03.619> and<00:01:04.790> that's

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
another two over here and that's

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.570 
another two over here and that's
firewire<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:07.320> service<00:01:07.770> runs<00:01:08.010> plugged<00:01:08.430> into

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
firewire the service runs plugged into

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.340 
firewire the service runs plugged into
the<00:01:08.700> back<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.000> computer<00:01:09.150> that's<00:01:10.110> to

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
the back of the computer that's to

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.590 
the back of the computer that's to
minimize<00:01:10.710> latency<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:12.060> stuff<00:01:12.270> like<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.570> I

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
minimize latency and stuff like that I

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.270 
minimize latency and stuff like that I
think<00:01:12.780> it's<00:01:12.960> 32<00:01:13.350> milliseconds<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:14.010> it's

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
think it's 32 milliseconds that it's

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:21.050 
think it's 32 milliseconds that it's
running<00:01:14.490> now<00:01:14.869> um<00:01:17.270> from<00:01:18.270> their<00:01:19.640> audio<00:01:20.640> cables

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
running now um from their audio cables

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.820 
running now um from their audio cables
plug<00:01:21.420> into<00:01:21.570> my<00:01:21.869> karekare<00:01:22.470> rocket<00:01:23.070> aids<00:01:24.830> which

plug into my karekare rocket aids which

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.960 
plug into my karekare rocket aids which
are<00:01:26.040> very<00:01:26.610> handy<00:01:27.030> for<00:01:27.560> for<00:01:28.560> dance<00:01:28.799> music<00:01:29.280> eight

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
I heard that six rocket part sixes are

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.100 
I heard that six rocket part sixes are
pretty<00:01:36.329> good<00:01:38.570> that<00:01:39.570> I<00:01:39.600> can<00:01:39.720> believe

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
pretty good that I can believe

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.520

I'll<00:01:40.439> of<00:01:40.680> KRK<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.460> stuff<00:01:41.700> is<00:01:41.820> brilliant<00:01:42.180> and

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
I'll of KRK the stuff is brilliant and

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.350 
I'll of KRK the stuff is brilliant and
the<00:01:43.530> rocket<00:01:43.920> power<00:01:44.130> tends<00:01:44.549> have<00:01:44.670> just<00:01:44.850> come

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
the rocket power tends have just come

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.429 
the rocket power tends have just come
out<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:45.509> think<00:01:45.950> and<00:01:46.950> they<00:01:47.070> look<00:01:47.310> incredible<00:01:48.380> and

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:54.139 

if<00:01:52.439> you<00:01:52.619> do<00:01:52.740> have<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.070> cash<00:01:53.280> though<00:01:53.610> I<00:01:53.850> would

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
if you do have the cash though I would

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.850 
if you do have the cash though I would
suggest<00:01:54.360> splashing<00:01:55.020> out<00:01:55.110> in<00:01:55.259> getting<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.590> VX

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
suggest splashing out in getting the VX

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.289 
suggest splashing out in getting the VX

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
buy this individually it would be so

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.680 
buy this individually it would be so
much<00:03:39.489> more<00:03:39.700> expensive<00:03:39.910> than<00:03:40.120> just<00:03:40.239> buying<00:03:40.570> the

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690
