says three five to one yes over here you

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.290 
says three five to one yes over here you
can<00:00:29.170> see<00:00:29.500> it's<00:00:29.740> really<00:00:30.490> mentioned<00:00:30.970> as<00:00:31.090> it's

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.259 
notches remove the hard remove the RAM
it's<00:02:15.480> basically<00:02:15.810> ddr3<00:02:16.739> sodium<00:02:17.180> sort<00:02:18.180> of

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
it's basically ddr3 sodium sort of

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:20.000 
it's basically ddr3 sodium sort of
sixteen<00:02:18.599> chips<00:02:18.930> sodium<00:02:19.349> so<00:02:19.500> we<00:02:19.590> suggest<00:02:19.920> you

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
sixteen chips sodium so we suggest you

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.320 
sixteen chips sodium so we suggest you
put<00:02:20.190> a<00:02:20.220> 16<00:02:20.610> chip<00:02:20.849> sodium<00:02:21.239> only<00:02:21.569> and<00:02:23.209> you<00:02:24.209> can

8+8 16 gb you can put one single sodium

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.690 
8+8 16 gb you can put one single sodium
of<00:02:29.610> 6<00:02:30.269> 8<00:02:30.540> gb<00:02:30.840> another<00:02:31.560> one<00:02:31.769> of<00:02:31.860> HCV<00:02:32.220> and<00:02:32.430> make<00:02:32.549> it

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
of 6 8 gb another one of HCV and make it

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.490 
of 6 8 gb another one of HCV and make it
16gb<00:02:33.180> too<00:02:33.329> there<00:02:33.569> are<00:02:33.630> two<00:02:33.750> slots<00:02:34.079> over<00:02:34.319> here

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
16gb too there are two slots over here

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.470 
16gb too there are two slots over here
as<00:02:34.560> you<00:02:34.650> can<00:02:34.680> see<00:02:34.910> coming<00:02:35.910> to<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.150> hard<00:02:36.360> drive
