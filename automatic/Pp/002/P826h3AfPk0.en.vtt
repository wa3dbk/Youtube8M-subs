00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 To be hello and welcome 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.790
 as with software losing today 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.270
 a bit about windows 8.2 so 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.270
 have fun 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.599
 as I said about windows 8.2 and indeed 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.000
 Let's start directly 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:28.270
 Generally, it should be roughly in the design of 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.490
 windows 8.1 stay or generally windows 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:34.120
 8 the tile surface should but 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:36.790
 We will all definitely change 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.440
 children the start button from the left 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:42.339
 lower corner when looking at the desktop 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.589
 and a designer is a 20-year-old 

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:47.949
 designer has a lot of cool here 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:49.839
 things are done here too , for example 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:52.030
 new start menu with some tiles 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:54.729
 to be displayed to your programs man 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.229
 Search apps can shut down the pc 

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:58.949
 Restart on the settings 

00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:00.909
 can access everything possible 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.190
 that certainly looks a lot 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:05.199
 very good 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.680
 a very good idea for this button 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.330
 It is necessary for everyone on the bottom left 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.930
 Fall on the map surface too 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.479
 come 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.450
 Unfortunately, I personally use the 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:18.070
 coffee pots surface not 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.140
 accordingly very good idea 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.079
 install tile surface so that they 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:27.369
 Just click this start button in the 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:29.079
 screen then asks 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.440
 Of course, it costs what when 

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:33.060
 it comes out 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.180
 What is it ? 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.460
 upgrade for windows so the successor 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:44.310
 from windows 8.1 I think so too 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:45.930
 then again in the store in the microsoft store 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.480
 available is that directly 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.740
 can download 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.320
 then it will probably come to an end 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.560
 In 2014 the betas will be in the beginning of 2014 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.690
 I do not have any but look 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.990
 we will 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:02.990
 and it will be 90 percent free 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.060
 There were also rumors that 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.980
 maybe windows 9 already come out 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.170
 not thinking that because if you do 

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.520
 8.1 skin out then you can also 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.990
 8.2 raushauen 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.140
 that does not have that big anymore 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:21.000
 difference and I honestly believe 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.490
 said that also come relatively quickly 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.090
 is 812 a real shot in 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.850
 the oven 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:31.710
 a real thing if I say so fucking 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:35.910
 update correctly many games 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:38.390
 Programs do not run anymore and it will 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.130
 hopefully fixed in 8.2 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:45.000
 because I just do not think that's okay 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.739
 that you offer something for download 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.930
 and then do not uninstall again 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:56.310
 let or similar is in any case 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:58.230
 very funny it should be synonymous in the right 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.500
 Knee still something to come and that 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:04.440
 you can also see some data here 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.330
 example with which one just skype the 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.430
 latest notifications all 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.320
 a stain 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:13.110
 how much battery you have left, how late 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.630
 Eg if you have a device connected 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:20.140
 how much battery that still hard how long that 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:22.340
 still to load needs such things 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.739
 of course also very cool motors see there 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.209
 would 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:29.680
 I honestly do not believe that 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:32.420
 that microsoft with a point iks 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.340
 update so bring big changes 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.500
 Of course he would be really interesting 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:40.060
 I am delighted but I do not think so 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.060
 that the update gets so big
