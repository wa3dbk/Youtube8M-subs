00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
other stuff because with this kernel

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.139 
other stuff because with this kernel

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
it's pretty cool you can overclock your

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.569 
it's pretty cool you can overclock your
Nexus<00:01:58.020> up<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.740> 3<00:01:59.159> gigahertz<00:01:59.640> so<00:02:00.509> that's<00:02:00.750> like

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
Nexus up to 3 gigahertz so that's like

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:06.139 
Nexus up to 3 gigahertz so that's like
insane<00:02:02.579> so<00:02:03.540> I'll<00:02:04.259> have<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:04.920> video<00:02:05.250> doing<00:02:06.060> a

insane so I'll have a video doing a

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.240 
insane so I'll have a video doing a
benchmark<00:02:06.689> with<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:07.049> but<00:02:07.860> that's<00:02:08.039> going<00:02:08.190> to

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
benchmark with that but that's going to

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.469 
benchmark with that but that's going to
be<00:02:08.310> in<00:02:08.429> another<00:02:08.520> video<00:02:09.030> because<00:02:09.149> I'm<00:02:09.360> gonna

I have the I've twerp from my recovery
so<00:02:29.400> you<00:02:29.460> boot<00:02:29.880> into<00:02:30.030> that<00:02:30.330> and<00:02:31.700> the<00:02:32.700> file<00:02:33.000> is

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
only about seven or eight megabytes so

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.870 
only about seven or eight megabytes so
super<00:02:39.030> tiny<00:02:39.240> um
