00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:07.170
 highlight this mass with one 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:09.240
 another match in the report simon 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.490
 I have found davies again and we 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.660
 look at us together 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.389
 of course, everyone's back on my same 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.460
 I suspect and I'm really curious 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.010
 what comes out when we clean now 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.570
 Unfortunately , I did not deserve my money 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.090
 good times I found the master 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.500
 believe for 45 million sold but that 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.599
 is a bad version here now 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:38.940
 of it so lax madness goes on 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:41.370
 a windforce bow 1158 dps is too 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.920
 relatively low for a two handed bow 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.920
 There are significantly better ones now 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.270
 we'll see after suppressed my 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.539
 thumb 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:58.079
 I think too little because about 308 is 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.480
 but decent or not 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.520
 criticism 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.140
 I do not know if it's worth it 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.430
 I do not look up to two times 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.920
 It continues with a mask 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:15.720
 reasonable helmet for wittstock was with 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:18.090
 80 eur 185 and was not allowed to 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:22.729
 therefore, has no critical and the 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:26.750
 helmet can have up to 300 intelligence 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:29.880
 Okay, let's see, but that 's the way it is 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:35.189
 Now here comes another crÃªpe 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:38.570
 crossbow 520 ps can do which on the 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:41.250
 so it is in the grain 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.820
 Maybe I'll have my luck 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.000
 watch 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:49.649
 pushes me the thumb is already scoring 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.159
 com bowls with strength not at all 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:59.210
 bad socket 390 strength 180 degrees of 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:59.210
 man believes he could be worth it 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:05.490
 a little bit gps could be more but 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.860
 so okay to the drinker I know myself 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.840
 not what it could be because of the look 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.530
 The two singers are looking like that 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:20.459
 155 in 6 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:22.110
 50 fire resistant welding horst i know 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.220
 We do not have to go in the first place either 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.390
 look up the auction house 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:29.520
 ok off to the auction house first time so from 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.350
 my last legendary porter had 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.000
 I am also my co-owner here 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.440
 I have not yet found 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.780
 but sells the model king school 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:41.640
 against for 22 3 million away really well 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.930
 and not sold much else 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.270
 the showed whiting but I have 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.700
 Now again in there and simply available 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.810
 Let's see what comes out 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.180
 but I'll just let you in 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.140
 the next level reporter say okay 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.670
 i would say i start with 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.230
 the keeper though I believe in it 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.630
 the hat of opinion is that the 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.300
 Nothing is worth it if I look at that 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.900
 hand watch though we are three 100 on it 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:06.860
 could have fun for fun 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:11.150
 Enter 250 in 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:15.239
 250 in 200 km 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.769
 We'll make 290 in a million 8 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.700
 just for fun 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:21.870
 million or 1 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.610
 without a buy out and if he is worth something 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.900
 then it should be already 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.750
 someone already find the purchase 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:32.250
 not okay scoren score nps transports 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:35.910
 into the grain so we have to deal with more 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:38.640
 better to be happy with 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.650
 inter or such a crap on strength strength 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:45.720
 Strength we want to strengthen with 300 strength 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:46.700
 in god if the prices already look 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:56.250
 I feel sick 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:04:01.130
 ok and tipped off with 170 and wifi gps did 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.130
 around 1250 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.769
 yes, if he had so much dps then 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:11.480
 I'll be happy but with 1200 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:14.620
 here again black at 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:17.150
 scoren ok too for a million or 1 and 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.130
 if someone finds his finger 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.500
 want to have a million or more like this 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:26.060

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:29.030
 ling the 155 with it in the ever 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.910
 the cheapest p 500 can do that 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:34.750
 not so bad but still he is 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:39.370
 has become relatively bad with inter 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:43.300
 had to be strong on it 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:48.380
 always christian always on it 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:56.720
 500k to come here maybe wants 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:57.740
 never so strong and coma 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.289
 really bad 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.580
 okay the things are in the auction house me 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:02.449
 I'm curious if I have any of this 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.160
