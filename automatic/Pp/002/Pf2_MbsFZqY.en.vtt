00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
put a cooler master fan that's the

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:48.889 
put a cooler master fan that's the
chipset<00:00:38.550> nuts<00:00:38.969> on<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:42.140> amd64<00:00:44.539> x<00:00:45.950> 2<00:00:47.690> all<00:00:48.690> right

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
chipset nuts on the amd64 x 2 all right

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.299 
chipset nuts on the amd64 x 2 all right
so<00:00:49.170> you<00:00:49.260> can<00:00:49.379> see<00:00:49.559> right<00:00:49.590> around<00:00:49.860> this<00:00:50.129> the

so you can see right around this the

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.209 
so you can see right around this the
motherboard<00:00:51.469> basically<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.559> main<00:00:52.710> brain<00:00:53.039> of

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
motherboard basically the main brain of

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.090 
motherboard basically the main brain of
the<00:00:53.280> computer<00:00:54.199> right<00:00:55.199> here<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.440> have<00:00:55.469> four

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
the computer right here you have four

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.830 
the computer right here you have four
sticks<00:00:56.579> of<00:00:57.620> ram<00:00:58.620> ddr2<00:00:59.250> RAM<00:00:59.760> I<00:01:00.770> even<00:01:01.770> got<00:01:01.980> done

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
sticks of ram ddr2 RAM I even got done

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.920 
sticks of ram ddr2 RAM I even got done
cool<00:01:03.840> your<00:01:03.960> plates<00:01:04.199> on<00:01:04.439> there<00:01:04.970> and<00:01:05.970> we're

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
cool your plates on there and we're

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:07.850 
cool your plates on there and we're
going<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.080> do<00:01:07.200> we're<00:01:07.320> going<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.500> put<00:01:07.650> in<00:01:07.770> a

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
going to do we're going to put in a

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.219 
going to do we're going to put in a
cooler<00:01:08.100> master<00:01:08.580> because<00:01:09.210> what<00:01:09.780> we<00:01:09.869> have<00:01:09.900> first

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
cooler master because what we have first

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.370 
cooler master because what we have first
with<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.500> AMD<00:01:10.890> fan<00:01:11.130> which<00:01:11.400> is<00:01:11.520> right<00:01:11.700> here

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
with the AMD fan which is right here

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.800 
with the AMD fan which is right here
that's<00:01:13.380> really<00:01:13.680> that's<00:01:13.890> what<00:01:14.100> we<00:01:14.189> have<00:01:14.340> first

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
that's really that's what we have first

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.510 
that's really that's what we have first
so<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.869> greatest<00:01:16.259> step<00:01:16.409> up<00:01:16.530> from<00:01:16.619> AMD<00:01:17.070> from

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
so the greatest step up from AMD from

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.050 
so the greatest step up from AMD from
the<00:01:17.640> factory<00:01:18.479> fan<00:01:18.979> to<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.009> custom<00:01:20.580> cooler

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
the factory fan to a custom cooler

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.620 
the factory fan to a custom cooler
master<00:01:22.040> and<00:01:23.040> as<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.670> can<00:01:23.820> see<00:01:23.850> them<00:01:24.330> be<00:01:24.509> your

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
master and as you can see them be your

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.990 
master and as you can see them be your
idea<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:26.180> what<00:01:27.180> coolermaster<00:01:27.840> fan<00:01:28.790> we<00:01:29.790> got

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
idea and what coolermaster fan we got

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.179 
idea and what coolermaster fan we got
brass<00:01:30.329> on<00:01:30.659> that<00:01:30.869> bitch<00:01:31.079> hit<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.740> like<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:31.890> little

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
brass on that bitch hit it like a little

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.770 
brass on that bitch hit it like a little
engine<00:01:32.689> fan<00:01:33.689> on<00:01:33.900> both<00:01:34.079> sides<00:01:35.540> let<00:01:36.540> me<00:01:36.600> show<00:01:36.750> you

engine fan on both sides let me show you

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.510 
engine fan on both sides let me show you
up<00:01:36.960> top<00:01:39.350> let's<00:01:40.350> let<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:40.799> know<00:01:40.950> whether<00:01:41.130> that's

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
up top let's let you know whether that's

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:48.450 
up top let's let you know whether that's
cooler<00:01:41.820> master<00:01:43.340> cooler<00:01:44.340> master

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.550
