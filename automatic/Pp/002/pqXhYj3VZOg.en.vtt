00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
big oh no like that so it's true like

00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:02.240 
big oh no like that so it's true like
yeah<00:00:54.120> he<00:00:54.239> did<00:00:57.500> circle<00:01:00.829> this<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:02.010> supposed<00:01:02.219> to

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
yeah he did circle this is supposed to

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.420 
yeah he did circle this is supposed to
be<00:01:02.340> cartoon<00:01:02.760> on<00:01:03.300> version<00:01:03.840> yes<00:01:04.110> I<00:01:04.409> guess<00:01:04.769> and

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
be cartoon on version yes I guess and

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.880 
be cartoon on version yes I guess and
then<00:01:05.729> it's<00:01:05.970> sort<00:01:06.479> of<00:01:06.689> like<00:01:06.900> hearts

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
then it's sort of like hearts

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:15.020 
then it's sort of like hearts
so<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.220> guess<00:01:08.490> time<00:01:08.939> anything<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.420> whole<00:01:09.570> does

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.389 

so<00:01:16.030> it's<00:01:16.149> like<00:01:16.299> a<00:01:16.329> heart<00:01:16.659> and<00:01:17.590> you<00:01:18.159> draw<00:01:18.369> a

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:18.399 
so it's like a heart and you draw a

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:28.740 
so it's like a heart and you draw a
circle<00:01:19.140> with<00:01:20.140> one<00:01:21.000> two<00:01:22.649> three<00:01:23.649> and<00:01:24.329> four<00:01:27.750> then

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
circle with one two three and four then

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.029 
circle with one two three and four then
