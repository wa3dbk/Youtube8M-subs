 glide the fun and I'm thrilled to open 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.250
 in this little news video about my 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.290
 news but project the spread of the 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.109
 chain et cetera and so on you go 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.940
 know everything then if we start with the 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.800
 start the youtube channel not put 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.990
 totally miro eve invites the videos 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.490
 the flip right now and it's likely to 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.410
 stay well for a while but 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.699
 studies does not slow down time I'm at 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.650
 two months of the contest about to be 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.029
 teacher of the same sense schools that 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.059
 my desire to play that she is a little bit 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.649
 road berne pretty much like this in addition to 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.450
 80 games it works like that you 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.040
 do not do novels with 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.960
 moments without it always comes back 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.290
 and then it stops always give 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.460
 to get a loan rises what 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.079
 suggest even more than 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.329
 the environment will come at some point 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.460
 so I do not hold my chair when 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.020
 I invite the studio game will post but 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.300
 in flip-flops rhythm re re lend 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.199
 not before I would say the beginning of the year 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.600
 next school 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.280
 it is almost certain the provost are 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.230
 at activities all summer and so on 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.690
 I also took a lot, so maybe 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.799
 that it will increase it will say more lively 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.210
 from September next October 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.400
 it's possible and that's what I 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.549
 I'll see if it will be at this moment 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.130
 there is no need to draw plans on the 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.200
 comet such command second us 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.549
 Arabs and important guys having 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.080
 important to listen well because my 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.520
 certainly I have a little less motivation 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.799
 to play more but then 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.450
 certainly not have fun on net and 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.700

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.770
