00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
cilantro and I'm gonna add a touch of

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.220 
cilantro and I'm gonna add a touch of
the<00:00:57.090> sugar<00:00:57.329> that's<00:00:57.539> called<00:00:57.870> for<00:00:58.079> in<00:00:58.140> the

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
the sugar that's called for in the

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.380 
the sugar that's called for in the
recipe<00:00:58.260> so<00:00:59.190> that<00:00:59.219> I<00:00:59.399> have<00:00:59.910> a<00:00:59.940> little<00:01:00.120> bit<00:01:00.300> of

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
recipe so that I have a little bit of

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.720 
recipe so that I have a little bit of
friction<00:01:00.570> in<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.199> mortar<00:01:01.500> I'm<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:02.309> big<00:01:02.489> fan<00:01:02.699> of

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
friction in the mortar I'm a big fan of

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.549 
friction in the mortar I'm a big fan of
the<00:01:02.910> mortar<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.239> pestle<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.719> it's<00:01:04.049> easier<00:01:04.439> to

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
the mortar and pestle and it's easier to

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.260 
the mortar and pestle and it's easier to
clean<00:01:04.799> than<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.040> food<00:01:05.220> processor<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:05.820> I

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
clean than the food processor and I

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.240 
clean than the food processor and I
think<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.600> releases<00:01:06.900> so<00:01:07.320> much<00:01:07.560> more<00:01:07.770> flavors

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
think it releases so much more flavors

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.890 
think it releases so much more flavors
I'm<00:01:08.490> gonna<00:01:08.670> add<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:08.850> touch<00:01:09.119> of<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.330> sesame<00:01:09.720> oil

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
I'm gonna add a touch of the sesame oil

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.170 
I'm gonna add a touch of the sesame oil
and<00:01:10.080> continue<00:01:10.260> pounding<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.220> then<00:01:11.790> pour

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
and continue pounding and then pour

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.960 
and continue pounding and then pour

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
you can see that the fibers run from

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.860 
you can see that the fibers run from
left<00:01:38.160> to<00:01:38.310> right<00:01:38.670> we're<00:01:39.270> going<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.510> cut<00:01:39.690> across

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:39.870 
left to right we're going to cut across

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.160 
left to right we're going to cut across
the<00:01:40.830> fibers<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.940> cut<00:01:42.150> across<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.900> toughness

and<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.620> stringiness<00:01:44.130> of<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.790> state<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:45.210> cut

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
and the stringiness of the state you cut

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.090
