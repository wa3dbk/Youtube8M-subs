00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:20.390
 hello today I want to bring you a video where 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.820
 I'm going to explain how we can 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.910
 record the audio of our tutorials 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:28.810
 of our videos and if we get to 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.640
 without a microphone there is a solution 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:35.180
 we can make our audios without 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.890
 program and without any microphone 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:41.090
 incorporated in our our 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:43.190
 laptops or our pc in this case I 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.969
 I have been without a microphone , I was 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:49.519
 lose and the solution that I found was 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:52.809
 I can record my audios from the videos 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:56.449
 together recording the screen of my pc 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:01:02.449
 with my phone the phone that I have 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:05.930
 right now is this a Lenovo s 60 s 62 and 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:09.830
 well I just placed my recorder 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.710
 voice on this phone and I'm recording to 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.800
 as I go 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.580
 talking 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.760
 and then that I do I have finished my 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:23.200
 recording 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:26.350
 I'm going to locate my audio in kansas and 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.550
 together with the video that I recorded to the 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:32.540
 time then I just open my 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:35.880
 recorder 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.340
 record and active immediately the 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.910
 voice recorder on my phone and this 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.590
 start both at the same time and already 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:48.670
 have everything ready 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:51.580
 I start it leaves like who says to tie 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.580
 to tie it both the video and the 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:59.590
 audio of each stay you have to this 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:01.740
 option to be able to locate the video 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.619
 and also the audio that we are going to place 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:08.179
 in this case you locate or open the 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:10.959
 Cancer 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.959
 and once 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:19.050
 open castilla 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:22.460
 is going to add the video and also going to 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.460
 add the audio 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.090
 and in an easy way that I did record 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.600
 this video for those people who 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.750
 maybe they have looked for the form and have not 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.750
 I have 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.099
 for saying they have not been able to record more of their 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.689
 videos for lack of good microphone yo 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:42.180
 I found this solution and I am 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:43.739
 sharing and well here it simply goes 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.540
 to import 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.260
 in this case the audio I have it here 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.709
 on desk 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.600
 the audio of the video that I recorded I place 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:56.430
 here 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:58.870
 and immediately I will also locate 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:02.019
 the video 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.720
 because one thing is also that for 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:07.770
 you matter 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:12.730
 the audio try to make your that your 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:14.480
 cell can worsen the format 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.700
 abi 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:22.129
 in mp3 or fermat format or format 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:24.260
 windows media because perseverance is going 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:26.900
 to recognize that way is not seen here 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.090
 I have it in windows media format and 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.489
