bear actually in druid form which is a

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.179 
bear actually in druid form which is a
bit<00:01:10.080> of<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.229> shame<00:01:10.439> but<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:10.830> guess<00:01:10.950> he<00:01:11.070> was<00:01:11.159> just

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
bit of a shame but I guess he was just

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.560 
bit of a shame but I guess he was just
using<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.640> for<00:01:11.670> rejuvenation<00:01:12.299> which<00:01:12.420> was

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
using it for rejuvenation which was

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.820 
using it for rejuvenation which was
obviously<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.930> be<00:01:12.990> really<00:01:13.290> effective<00:01:13.680> in<00:01:13.770> the

obviously to be really effective in the

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.289 
regardless of handicap and stuff but
still<00:01:28.170> it's<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.439> very<00:01:28.470> very<00:01:29.250> impressive<00:01:30.000> number

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
still it's a very very impressive number

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.789 
still it's a very very impressive number
of<00:01:30.360> hit<00:01:30.450> points<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.780> gonna<00:01:31.259> be<00:01:31.320> getting<00:01:31.560> level

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
a whole bunch of damage will be able to

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.920 
a whole bunch of damage will be able to
I<00:01:37.560> take<00:01:37.799> out<00:01:37.920> those<00:01:38.070> bears<00:01:38.369> quite<00:01:38.640> quickly

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
I take out those bears quite quickly

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.300 
I take out those bears quite quickly
assuming<00:01:39.930> he<00:01:40.020> gets<00:01:40.049> a<00:01:40.259> positioning<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:40.890> that

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310

probably<00:01:41.790> what<00:01:42.000> this<00:01:42.090> games<00:01:42.299> do<00:01:42.450> they<00:01:42.509> come

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
probably what this games do they come

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.710 
probably what this games do they come
down<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.840> now<00:01:43.140> it's<00:01:43.290> just<00:01:43.409> positioning

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
down to now it's just positioning

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.609 
down to now it's just positioning
probably<00:01:45.720> really<00:01:45.899> needs<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.079> heal<00:01:46.290> up<00:01:46.409> at<00:01:46.560> this

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
probably really needs to heal up at this

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.999 
probably really needs to heal up at this
point<00:01:46.860> is<00:01:47.009> he<00:01:47.130> buying<00:01:47.310> am<00:01:47.729> oh<00:01:47.939> here's<00:01:48.390> is<00:01:48.540> a

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.320 
Phoenix actually severely impaired I'm
thinking<00:02:37.220> about<00:02:37.340> this<00:02:37.520> because<00:02:37.880> during<00:02:38.210> he

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
thinking about this because during he

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:39.430 
thinking about this because during he
only<00:02:38.510> has<00:02:38.600> half<00:02:38.780> the<00:02:38.810> hip<00:02:39.080> point<00:02:39.290> that<00:02:39.380> the

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
only has half the hip point that the

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.930 
only has half the hip point that the
community<00:02:39.800> is<00:02:39.860> spending<00:02:40.100> up<00:02:40.220> proportionally

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
form as opposed to in Phoenix form then

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.840 
form as opposed to in Phoenix form then
you<00:02:48.380> can<00:02:48.500> see<00:02:48.650> just<00:02:48.860> got<00:02:49.070> out<00:02:49.190> of<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.430> egg<00:02:49.580> form

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
you can see just got out of the egg form

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.220 
you can see just got out of the egg form
now<00:02:49.970> he's<00:02:50.210> already<00:02:50.330> back<00:02:50.630> in<00:02:50.660> it<00:02:50.900> in<00:02:51.020> any
