 and 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:28.230
 this 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.230
 of your birth 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.950
 sadness and 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.140
 and 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.170
 sets 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.690

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.980
 and and 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.240
 Yes 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.520
 sochi 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.330

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.330
 beautiful 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.680
 can't 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.440
 they were 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.440
 and 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.070
 issue 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.940
 and spoke 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.940
 or 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.940
 but 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:18.460
 So look at the entry we take 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:23.390
 first chord 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:28.850
 bulk note 5 string empty not breeze 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:31.830
 yes further 4 string pressed on the seventh 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:35.840
 fret on the fourth string 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:40.299
 then the third string on the fifth fret 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.299
 2 and the first open and 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.230
 played by us 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.520
 532 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.520
 123 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.210
 i will stay playing 5 bass 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.230
 after the first time we play for the second time 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.230
 fourth string bass 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:14.000
 and 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:17.590
 and for the fourth time we get 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.590
 right hand play 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.640
 532 3123 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.590
 so we will play the whole song 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:43.750
 bout is understandable brute force first chord 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:47.290
 with the entry figured out 1 exactly 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.329
 song lonely lilac branch 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.930
 this is the line that plays this 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:55.450
 chord that we just played you 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.900
 on the table was a second chord with us 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:02.700
 the third string is taken on the fifth fret 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.700
 2 on the sixth 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:13.560
 it is clear further in G major 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:17.489
 same clearly called chord further yes with 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:19.700
 also knows everything so that we still have there 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:23.880
 will be 1 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:28.380
 on the city in A major normal and then you will 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:32.010
 seventh chord with pressing 1 2 3 4 on the second 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:35.810
 fret and press any finger like him 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.810
 convenient first string on 3 fret 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:44.739
 we can do it a7 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:46.420
 and then m well there all the chords are signed 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:52.379
 that's basically the most difficult 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:52.379
 I told everyone good luck for now
