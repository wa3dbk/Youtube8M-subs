carving<00:00:33.800> skis<00:00:34.070> are<00:00:34.460> much<00:00:34.760> wider<00:00:35.059> at<00:00:35.449> the<00:00:35.480> top

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
carving skis are much wider at the top

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.400 
carving skis are much wider at the top
and<00:00:36.050> bottom<00:00:36.320> compared<00:00:37.250> to<00:00:37.430> traditional<00:00:37.610> skis

but this actually makes it easier when

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.139 
but this actually makes it easier when
you<00:00:44.480> edge<00:00:44.719> your<00:00:45.320> carving<00:00:45.800> skis<00:00:46.100> and<00:00:46.879> at<00:00:47.030> the

the<00:00:52.370> skis<00:00:52.670> will<00:00:53.149> automatically<00:00:54.019> create<00:00:54.379> a

the skis will automatically create a

the skis will automatically create a
curve

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
you start to accelerate you will

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.120 
you start to accelerate you will
experience<00:01:06.640> that<00:01:06.910> the<00:01:07.060> skis<00:01:07.360> turn<00:01:07.870> almost<00:01:08.560> by

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.760

keep a good distance between your skis

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.520 
keep a good distance between your skis
so<00:01:17.670> you'll<00:01:17.850> have<00:01:18.030> room<00:01:18.300> enough<00:01:18.510> to<00:01:19.020> work<00:01:19.260> with

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
so you'll have room enough to work with

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.690 
so you'll have room enough to work with
both<00:01:19.920> skis

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
both skis

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.630
