that's just kind of if you look at how

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:06.459 
that's just kind of if you look at how
LeBron<00:01:04.879> is<00:01:05.239> with<00:01:05.390> the<00:01:05.479> ball<00:01:05.630> life<00:01:05.900> you<00:01:06.170> know<00:01:06.320> he

00:01:06.459 --> 00:01:06.469 
LeBron is with the ball life you know he

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:09.340 
LeBron is with the ball life you know he
makes<00:01:06.680> the<00:01:06.829> pass<00:01:07.070> room<00:01:07.310> across<00:01:07.490> four<00:01:08.170> get<00:01:09.170> some

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
makes the pass room across four get some

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.319 
makes the pass room across four get some
transition<00:01:09.920> to<00:01:09.979> go<00:01:10.100> past<00:01:10.310> all<00:01:10.549> that<00:01:10.579> second<00:01:11.210> so

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:11.329 
transition to go past all that second so

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:12.670 
transition to go past all that second so
it<00:01:11.390> gives<00:01:11.570> so<00:01:12.020> many<00:01:12.110> different<00:01:12.439> opportunities

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
it gives so many different opportunities

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.780 
it gives so many different opportunities

to<00:01:26.810> be<00:01:26.899> said<00:01:27.049> about<00:01:27.310> might<00:01:28.310> be<00:01:28.430> the<00:01:28.549> point

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
to be said about might be the point

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:30.969 
to be said about might be the point
guard<00:01:28.969> on<00:01:29.030> a<00:01:29.090> champion<00:01:30.049> can<00:01:30.200> evolve<00:01:30.439> he's<00:01:30.799> done

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
guard on a champion can evolve he's done

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.050 
guard on a champion can evolve he's done
it<00:01:31.100> and<00:01:31.990> some<00:01:32.990> insecurities<00:01:33.710> that<00:01:33.969> we<00:01:34.969> don't

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
it and some insecurities that we don't

it's<00:01:37.880> quickly<00:01:38.240> erased<00:01:38.540> which<00:01:39.079> you<00:01:39.229> had<00:01:39.380> the

it's quickly erased which you had the

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.139 
it's quickly erased which you had the
validation<00:01:40.009> of<00:01:40.040> a<00:01:40.130> championship<00:01:40.610> so<00:01:40.880> I<00:01:40.909> think

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
validation of a championship so I think

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:42.880 
validation of a championship so I think
he's<00:01:41.360> just<00:01:41.509> more<00:01:41.630> confident<00:01:42.110> who<00:01:42.439> is<00:01:42.619> and<00:01:42.799> what
