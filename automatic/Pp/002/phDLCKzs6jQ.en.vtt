00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
north of the Willie Willie in a straight

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.980 
north of the Willie Willie in a straight
line<00:01:06.800> cuts<00:01:07.610> through<00:01:07.820> the<00:01:07.940> island<00:01:08.300> we<00:01:08.450> had<00:01:08.869> to

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
line cuts through the island we had to

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.710 
line cuts through the island we had to
tack<00:01:09.340> into<00:01:10.340> a<00:01:10.369> northeasterly<00:01:11.090> to<00:01:11.390> gain<00:01:11.570> an

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
tack into a northeasterly to gain an

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.139 
tack into a northeasterly to gain an
offing<00:01:12.110> from<00:01:12.920> the<00:01:13.039> island<00:01:13.430> so<00:01:13.610> we<00:01:13.880> could<00:01:14.000> lay

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:14.149 
offing from the island so we could lay

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:17.920 
offing from the island so we could lay
our<00:01:14.300> course<00:01:15.220> so<00:01:16.220> so<00:01:16.640> now<00:01:16.850> we<00:01:16.910> are<00:01:17.210> sailing<00:01:17.450> of

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
our course so so now we are sailing of

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.639 
our course so so now we are sailing of

well why are we sailing Northwest in

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.069 
well why are we sailing Northwest in
perfect<00:01:37.400> conditions<00:01:37.930> conditions<00:01:38.930> are

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079 
perfect conditions conditions are

perfect conditions conditions are
perfect<00:01:39.320> by<00:01:39.650> the<00:01:39.680> way<00:01:39.860> it's<00:01:40.070> absolutely<00:01:40.630> fiber

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
perfect by the way it's absolutely fiber

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.030 
perfect by the way it's absolutely fiber
in<00:01:41.869> their<00:01:42.170> paths<00:01:44.020> right<00:01:45.020> beautiful<00:01:45.320> sunny<00:01:45.799> day

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
wind exactly from the right direction

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.840 
wind exactly from the right direction
we're<00:01:51.530> sailing<00:01:51.920> a<00:01:51.979> nice<00:01:52.159> broad<00:01:52.460> reach<00:01:54.850> so

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
we're sailing a nice broad reach so

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.560 
we're sailing a nice broad reach so
anyway<00:01:56.180> we're<00:01:56.329> going<00:01:56.479> Northwest<00:01:57.110> because<00:01:58.570> we

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
anyway we're going Northwest because we

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.380 
anyway we're going Northwest because we
want<00:01:59.810> to<00:01:59.979> continue<00:02:00.979> around<00:02:01.159> the<00:02:02.000> North

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
want to continue around the North

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:03.660 
want to continue around the North
Pacific<00:02:02.600> high<00:02:03.079> which<00:02:03.439> is

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
Pacific high which is

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.210 
Pacific high which is
uncharacteristically<00:02:04.670> west<00:02:05.149> of<00:02:06.079> its<00:02:06.290> usual

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
uncharacteristically west of its usual

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.170 
uncharacteristically west of its usual
this<00:02:07.370> year<00:02:07.550> so<00:02:08.380> need<00:02:09.380> to<00:02:09.500> go<00:02:09.850> northwesterly<00:02:10.850> to

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
this year so need to go northwesterly to

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.600 
this year so need to go northwesterly to
get<00:02:11.330> around<00:02:11.540> the<00:02:11.780> high<00:02:11.930> but<00:02:12.400> specifically<00:02:13.400> to

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
get around the high but specifically to

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.260 
get around the high but specifically to
the<00:02:13.700> west<00:02:13.850> go<00:02:14.240> west<00:02:14.270> to<00:02:15.170> get<00:02:15.290> around<00:02:15.470> the<00:02:15.620> high

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
the west go west to get around the high

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.850 
the west go west to get around the high
so<00:02:17.270> that<00:02:17.300> we<00:02:17.540> can<00:02:17.690> have<00:02:17.870> wind<00:02:18.110> enough<00:02:18.410> to<00:02:18.620> sail

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
so that we can have wind enough to sail

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.200 
so that we can have wind enough to sail
all<00:02:19.190> the<00:02:19.220> way<00:02:21.010> if<00:02:22.010> you<00:02:22.160> inadvertently<00:02:22.490> sail

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
all the way if you inadvertently sail

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.270 
all the way if you inadvertently sail
into<00:02:23.570> the<00:02:23.900> high<00:02:24.110> the<00:02:24.530> North<00:02:24.740> Pacific<00:02:24.860> high

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
into the high the North Pacific high

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.430 
into the high the North Pacific high
it's<00:02:25.550> a<00:02:25.640> big<00:02:25.820> high-pressure<00:02:26.240> area<00:02:26.660> we<00:02:26.840> go<00:02:27.170> win

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
it's a big high-pressure area we go win

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.180 
it's a big high-pressure area we go win
so<00:02:28.870> people<00:02:29.870> do<00:02:30.020> do<00:02:30.230> that<00:02:30.260> they<00:02:30.710> just<00:02:30.980> don't

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
so people do do that they just don't

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.370 
so people do do that they just don't
take<00:02:31.820> a<00:02:31.850> run<00:02:32.120> line<00:02:32.300> course<00:02:32.630> to<00:02:32.870> say<00:02:33.110> San

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
take a run line course to say San

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.680 
take a run line course to say San
Francisco<00:02:33.950> from<00:02:34.130> Hawaii<00:02:34.520> just<00:02:35.330> planning<00:02:35.600> a

Francisco from Hawaii just planning a
motor<00:02:35.900> through<00:02:36.860> the<00:02:37.010> high<00:02:37.190> and<00:02:37.520> we've<00:02:37.640> done

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
motor through the high and we've done

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:43.570 
motor through the high and we've done
that<00:02:38.060> actually<00:02:38.470> we<00:02:39.470> did<00:02:39.620> that<00:02:42.370> that's<00:02:43.370> not

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
that actually we did that that's not

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.340 
that actually we did that that's not
what<00:02:43.790> we're<00:02:43.940> gonna<00:02:44.120> do<00:02:44.330> we're<00:02:44.600> gonna<00:02:44.690> sail<00:02:45.050> all

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
what we're gonna do we're gonna sail all

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.610 
what we're gonna do we're gonna sail all
the<00:02:45.380> way<00:02:45.500> to<00:02:45.620> Alaska<00:02:46.510> we're<00:02:47.510> gonna<00:02:47.600> try<00:02:47.900> to<00:02:47.930> use

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
the way to Alaska we're gonna try to use

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.110 
the way to Alaska we're gonna try to use
the<00:02:48.770> intelligence<00:02:49.310> we<00:02:49.430> have<00:02:49.580> on<00:02:49.760> the<00:02:49.850> weather

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120
