00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
while we were tracking so we did drums

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.980 
while we were tracking so we did drums
in<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.320> middle<00:01:43.560> of<00:01:43.649> tracking<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.579> we<00:01:44.729> did

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
in the middle of tracking and we did

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.050 
in the middle of tracking and we did
yeah<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.110> was<00:01:46.229> weird<00:01:46.350> so<00:01:46.619> we<00:01:46.740> would<00:01:46.890> do<00:01:47.040> like<00:01:47.250> we

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
yeah it was weird so we would do like we

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.270 
yeah it was weird so we would do like we
did<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.240> lot<00:01:48.420> of<00:01:48.500> guitars<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.740> bass<00:01:49.860> during<00:01:50.159> the

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
did a lot of guitars and bass during the

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.090 
did a lot of guitars and bass during the
day<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.729> then<00:01:50.939> we<00:01:51.570> worked<00:01:51.840> nocturnally<00:01:52.590> so<00:01:52.860> we

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
day and then we worked nocturnally so we

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.280 
day and then we worked nocturnally so we
do<00:01:53.280> vocals<00:01:53.670> at<00:01:53.820> night<00:01:54.030> so<00:01:54.329> like<00:01:54.509> maybe<00:01:54.960> like<00:01:55.110> 8

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
do vocals at night so like maybe like 8

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.469 
do vocals at night so like maybe like 8
or<00:01:55.439> 9<00:01:55.560> in<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.740> morning<00:01:55.799> so<00:01:56.700> it<00:01:57.240> was<00:01:57.360> very

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
or 9 in the morning so it was very

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.270 
or 9 in the morning so it was very
backwards<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.200> reversed<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.770> weird<00:01:59.009> and

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
backwards and reversed and weird and

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.219 
backwards and reversed and weird and
just<00:01:59.850> very<00:02:00.060> scattered<00:02:00.600> but<00:02:00.750> I<00:02:00.810> think<00:02:01.110> that's

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
just very scattered but I think that's

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.899 
just very scattered but I think that's
what<00:02:01.350> made<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:01.530> so<00:02:01.860> unique<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:02.700> so<00:02:02.880> different

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
what made it so unique and so different

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.580 
what made it so unique and so different
because<00:02:03.420> we<00:02:03.630> could<00:02:03.810> we<00:02:04.020> just<00:02:04.200> jumped<00:02:04.439> from

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
because we could we just jumped from

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.080 
because we could we just jumped from
song<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:04.799> song<00:02:04.950> whenever<00:02:05.460> we<00:02:05.549> felt<00:02:05.759> like<00:02:05.909> it

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
song to song whenever we felt like it

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.029 
song to song whenever we felt like it
and<00:02:06.180> just<00:02:06.390> kind<00:02:07.049> of<00:02:07.110> built<00:02:07.320> them<00:02:07.500> up<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:07.890> whole

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
and just kind of built them up the whole

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.449 
and just kind of built them up the whole
time<00:02:08.220> we<00:02:08.340> were<00:02:08.429> there<00:02:08.459> Blake<00:02:09.179> take<00:02:09.390> that<00:02:10.459> and

white<00:06:00.570> noise<00:06:00.720> came<00:06:00.990> out<00:06:01.110> I<00:06:01.350> think<00:06:02.250> just<00:06:02.460> white

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:02.610 
white noise came out I think just white

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:03.800 
white noise came out I think just white
noise<00:06:02.639> coming<00:06:03.120> up<00:06:03.210> cuz

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:03.810 
noise coming up cuz

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:05.450 
noise coming up cuz
without<00:06:04.410> that<00:06:04.620> coming<00:06:04.740> out<00:06:04.949> nothing<00:06:05.190> else

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 
without that coming out nothing else

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.460 
without that coming out nothing else
would<00:06:05.610> have<00:06:05.699> happened<00:06:06.030> so<00:06:06.240> I<00:06:06.570> think<00:06:07.139> that's

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:07.470 
would have happened so I think that's

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:09.620 
would have happened so I think that's
our<00:06:07.620> highlight<00:06:08.040> for<00:06:08.310> me<00:06:08.400> is<00:06:08.430> that<00:06:08.760> for<00:06:09.540> those
