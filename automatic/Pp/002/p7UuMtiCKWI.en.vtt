00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
these ones that the home based ones work

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.400 
these ones that the home based ones work
out<00:00:35.070> slightly<00:00:35.520> more<00:00:35.910> complicated<00:00:36.300> but<00:00:36.960> it's

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
out slightly more complicated but it's

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.240 
out slightly more complicated but it's
much<00:00:38.070> of<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.340> muchness<00:00:38.489> so<00:00:39.530> when<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:40.710> get<00:00:40.980> them

for growing inside they're not for
growing<00:02:13.680> outside<00:02:14.010> you<00:02:15.000> need<00:02:15.270> to<00:02:15.450> find<00:02:15.690> a<00:02:15.930> place

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
growing outside you need to find a place

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
need to be snuggly it just needs to be

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.110 
need to be snuggly it just needs to be
to<00:04:26.169> sort<00:04:26.410> of<00:04:26.470> let<00:04:27.100> me<00:04:27.220> show<00:04:27.400> you<00:04:27.430> consistency

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
to sort of let me show you consistency

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.719 
to sort of let me show you consistency
it<00:04:28.479> needs<00:04:28.840> to<00:04:28.990> sort<00:04:29.290> of<00:04:29.410> hold<00:04:29.949> together<00:04:30.280> like

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:30.729 
it needs to sort of hold together like

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:32.879 
it needs to sort of hold together like
like<00:04:31.449> that<00:04:31.780> but<00:04:32.080> then<00:04:32.199> you<00:04:32.320> can<00:04:32.500> just<00:04:32.650> crumble

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:32.889 
like that but then you can just crumble

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:36.990 
like that but then you can just crumble
it<00:04:33.100> apart<00:04:33.960> ok<00:04:34.960> I<00:04:35.199> will<00:04:36.190> just<00:04:36.400> add<00:04:36.580> a<00:04:36.610> little<00:04:36.820> bit

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
it apart ok I will just add a little bit

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.629 
it apart ok I will just add a little bit
more<00:04:37.240> just<00:04:37.540> to<00:04:37.690> get<00:04:37.810> down<00:04:38.020> to<00:04:38.199> the<00:04:38.229> bottom<00:04:38.639> so

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:39.639 
more just to get down to the bottom so

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:41.340 
more just to get down to the bottom so
that's<00:04:39.940> about<00:04:40.060> a<00:04:40.240> quarter<00:04:40.540> of<00:04:40.750> the<00:04:40.810> liter<00:04:41.080> if

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
that's about a quarter of the liter if

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.070 
that's about a quarter of the liter if
you<00:04:41.530> have<00:04:41.740> got<00:04:41.889> a<00:04:41.919> big<00:04:42.160> tub<00:04:42.550> then<00:04:43.419> put<00:04:43.449> it<00:04:43.840> in<00:04:43.990> a

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:54.500 
circulating through so we'll put it

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:58.659 
circulating through so we'll put it
under<00:06:54.830> the<00:06:54.919> stairs<00:06:55.220> like<00:06:55.550> that<00:06:55.880> and<00:06:57.400> we'll<00:06:58.400> see

seems<00:07:08.900> to<00:07:09.140> work<00:07:09.560> a<00:07:09.800> bit<00:07:09.950> better<00:07:10.220> but<00:07:10.790> as<00:07:10.910> long

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:11.120 
seems to work a bit better but as long

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.670 
seems to work a bit better but as long
as<00:07:11.150> the<00:07:11.390> temperature<00:07:11.960> in<00:07:12.080> the<00:07:12.200> place<00:07:12.440> that

as the temperature in the place that

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.920 
as the temperature in the place that
you're<00:07:12.830> putting<00:07:13.130> it<00:07:13.430> is<00:07:13.580> a<00:07:14.150> relatively

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:14.930 
you're putting it is a relatively

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:17.440 
you're putting it is a relatively
constant<00:07:15.910> temperature<00:07:16.910> there's<00:07:17.090> no<00:07:17.210> point

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:17.450 
constant temperature there's no point

putting in the airing cupboard because

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.240 
putting in the airing cupboard because
that<00:07:18.770> will<00:07:18.890> get<00:07:19.070> hot<00:07:19.310> if<00:07:19.580> you<00:07:20.210> have<00:07:20.570> got<00:07:20.960> an

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:21.250 
that will get hot if you have got an

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:23.920 
that will get hot if you have got an
uncovered<00:07:22.250> under<00:07:22.760> the<00:07:22.880> stairs<00:07:23.180> then<00:07:23.690> that

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:23.930 
uncovered under the stairs then that

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:26.380 
uncovered under the stairs then that
would<00:07:24.080> be<00:07:24.229> the<00:07:24.350> best<00:07:24.530> place<00:07:24.830> to<00:07:25.160> put<00:07:25.370> it<00:07:25.400> now<00:07:26.120> in

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:26.390 
would be the best place to put it now in

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:30.430 
would be the best place to put it now in
about<00:07:26.510> a<00:07:27.080> week<00:07:28.000> apparently<00:07:29.000> we<00:07:29.810> should<00:07:30.020> start

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:30.440 
about a week apparently we should start

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:34.380
