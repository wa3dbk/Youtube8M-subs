the<00:00:38.500> a<00:00:38.530> class<00:00:38.829> and<00:00:39.010> the<00:00:39.070> B<00:00:39.190> class<00:00:39.399> share<00:00:39.789> the

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
the a class and the B class share the

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.910 
the a class and the B class share the
same<00:00:40.120> engine<00:00:40.510> so<00:00:40.660> you<00:00:40.719> have<00:00:40.960> the<00:00:41.110> same<00:00:41.289> 1.6

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920

the<00:01:00.620> problem<00:01:00.950> is<00:01:01.070> again<00:01:01.310> the<00:01:01.430> same<00:01:01.580> up<00:01:02.060> shifts

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
the problem is again the same up shifts

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 
go back to that economy mode or the

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.240
