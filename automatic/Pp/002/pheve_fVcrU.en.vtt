00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.030 
today and I think Tom said it but I
think<00:01:05.110> it's<00:01:05.199> worth<00:01:05.229> reiterating<00:01:05.470> I<00:01:05.920> know

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
think it's worth reiterating I know

00:01:06.040 --> 00:02:54.540 
think it's worth reiterating I know
they're<00:01:06.220> not<00:01:06.340> yours

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.120 

so<00:02:55.550> wealthy<00:02:55.850> that's<00:02:56.390> what<00:02:56.630> they<00:02:56.810> did<00:02:56.870> can<00:02:57.770> you

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
isn't any regulation on that well I

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.990 
isn't any regulation on that well I
think<00:03:03.050> some<00:03:03.440> did<00:03:03.740> and<00:03:03.950> some<00:03:04.160> did<00:03:04.430> not<00:03:04.460> now

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000
