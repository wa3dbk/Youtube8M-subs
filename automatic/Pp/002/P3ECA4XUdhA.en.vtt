00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
line well he's lucky that he put the

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.169 
line well he's lucky that he put the
ball<00:00:02.190> on<00:00:02.370> the<00:00:02.460> floor<00:00:02.639> it<00:00:02.879> would<00:00:02.970> have<00:00:03.060> been

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
ball on the floor it would have been

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:04.550 
ball on the floor it would have been
three<00:00:03.360> free-throws<00:00:03.659> because<00:00:04.080> he<00:00:04.200> was<00:00:04.319> behind

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
three free-throws because he was behind

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.230

the<00:00:04.740> line<00:00:04.770> so<00:00:05.069> I<00:00:05.130> think<00:00:05.190> Dirk<00:00:05.670> wasn't<00:00:06.089> sure

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
the line so I think Dirk wasn't sure

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.789 
the line so I think Dirk wasn't sure
where<00:00:06.420> the<00:00:06.540> foul<00:00:06.750> was<00:00:06.899> gonna<00:00:07.049> be<00:00:07.230> called<00:00:07.440> so<00:00:07.680> he

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
where the foul was gonna be called so he

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.290 
where the foul was gonna be called so he
bounced<00:00:08.189> the<00:00:08.280> ball<00:00:08.309> so<00:00:08.670> he<00:00:08.820> wouldn't<00:00:09.090> walk

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
bounced the ball so he wouldn't walk

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.480 
bounced the ball so he wouldn't walk
with<00:00:09.570> it<00:00:09.750> and<00:00:12.139> Deron<00:00:13.139> Williams<00:00:13.320> I<00:00:13.740> think<00:00:14.009> just

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
with it and Deron Williams I think just

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.550 
with it and Deron Williams I think just
lost<00:00:14.700> sight<00:00:15.030> of<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.480> fact<00:00:15.780> that<00:00:15.960> that<00:00:16.320> foul

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
lost sight of the fact that that foul

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.260 
lost sight of the fact that that foul
puts<00:00:16.890> them<00:00:17.039> over<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.400> limit<00:00:17.699> and<00:00:17.940> he<00:00:18.150> was

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
puts them over the limit and he was

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.880 
puts them over the limit and he was
upset<00:00:18.630> too<00:00:18.869> because<00:00:19.080> he<00:00:19.230> had<00:00:19.320> driven<00:00:19.500> in<00:00:19.740> there

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
upset too because he had driven in there

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.740 
upset too because he had driven in there
and<00:00:20.010> Wade<00:00:20.189> had<00:00:20.400> stripped<00:00:20.850> him<00:00:21.060> on<00:00:21.270> that<00:00:21.449> play

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
and Wade had stripped him on that play

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.320 
and Wade had stripped him on that play
so<00:00:22.140> he<00:00:22.260> had<00:00:22.380> come<00:00:22.590> back<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:22.830> again<00:00:23.580> I<00:00:23.910> don't

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330
