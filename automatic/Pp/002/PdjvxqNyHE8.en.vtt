00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
but I think that may be incorrect great

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:15.640 
but I think that may be incorrect great
let's<00:05:10.040> get<00:05:10.190> on<00:05:10.280> up<00:05:10.310> here<00:05:13.240> OMS<00:05:14.380> maybe<00:05:15.380> I<00:05:15.470> do<00:05:15.620> a

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 
let's get on up here OMS maybe I do a

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.330 
let's get on up here OMS maybe I do a
four<00:05:15.950> percent<00:05:16.190> accuracy<00:05:17.950> but<00:05:18.950> that<00:05:19.070> doesn't

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
four percent accuracy but that doesn't

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:20.740 
four percent accuracy but that doesn't
make<00:05:19.400> sense<00:05:19.460> my<00:05:19.820> accuracy<00:05:20.120> overalls<00:05:20.540> like

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
make sense my accuracy overalls like

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.960 
make sense my accuracy overalls like
twenty<00:05:21.170> two<00:05:21.320> percent<00:05:21.470> or<00:05:21.800> something<00:05:22.130> as<00:05:22.670> worth

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 
twenty two percent or something as worth
