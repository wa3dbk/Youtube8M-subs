kalua<00:00:41.630> pork<00:00:41.930> which<00:00:42.770> is<00:00:42.950> very<00:00:43.160> similar<00:00:43.460> to

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
kalua pork which is very similar to

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.120 
kalua pork which is very similar to
carnitas<00:00:44.630> and<00:00:44.900> so<00:00:45.080> that's<00:00:45.290> going<00:00:45.470> to<00:00:45.530> be<00:00:45.680> we

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:46.130 
carnitas and so that's going to be we

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.400 
carnitas and so that's going to be we
have<00:00:46.280> some<00:00:46.490> of<00:00:46.610> this<00:00:46.670> Asian<00:00:47.240> some<00:00:47.660> of<00:00:47.750> this<00:00:47.870> I

have some of this Asian some of this I

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.660 
have some of this Asian some of this I
guess<00:00:49.010> we<00:00:49.130> would<00:00:49.280> call<00:00:49.310> it<00:00:50.830> Latino<00:00:51.830> flavoring

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
guess we would call it Latino flavoring

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.250 
guess we would call it Latino flavoring

that together
yeah<00:01:17.480> go<00:01:17.750> ahead<00:01:17.780> a<00:01:17.900> mix<00:01:18.080> that<00:01:18.230> up<00:01:18.320> now<00:01:18.500> we<00:01:19.400> made

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
yeah go ahead a mix that up now we made

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.060 
yeah go ahead a mix that up now we made
the<00:01:19.850> people<00:01:20.510> cucumbers<00:01:21.260> just<00:01:21.680> before<00:01:21.950> we're

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
the people cucumbers just before we're

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.320 
the people cucumbers just before we're
gonna<00:01:22.160> serve<00:01:22.490> them<00:01:22.700> and<00:01:22.850> the<00:01:22.940> reason<00:01:23.210> we're

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
gonna serve them and the reason we're

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.510 
gonna serve them and the reason we're
doing<00:01:23.450> that<00:01:23.570> is<00:01:23.660> because<00:01:23.840> if<00:01:24.650> we<00:01:24.710> do<00:01:24.980> it<00:01:25.010> early

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
doing that is because if we do it early

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.980 
doing that is because if we do it early
you<00:01:25.730> can<00:01:25.940> get<00:01:26.060> a<00:01:26.090> lot<00:01:26.240> more<00:01:26.270> flavor<00:01:26.540> but<00:01:26.900> we

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
you can get a lot more flavor but we

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.860 
you can get a lot more flavor but we
want<00:01:27.170> to<00:01:27.260> avoid<00:01:27.500> a<00:01:27.560> crunch<00:01:28.300> what<00:01:29.300> we<00:01:29.420> would<00:01:29.630> do

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:29.870 
want to avoid a crunch what we would do

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:31.870 
want to avoid a crunch what we would do
is<00:01:30.020> I<00:01:30.200> would<00:01:30.290> rather<00:01:30.500> we<00:01:31.220> have<00:01:31.370> more<00:01:31.580> time<00:01:31.820> or

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
is I would rather we have more time or

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.970
