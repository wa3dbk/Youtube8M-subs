00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.690 

so<00:02:45.610> like<00:02:46.150> I'm<00:02:46.299> saying<00:02:46.569> ratchet<00:02:47.019> can't<00:02:47.230> see

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
so like I'm saying ratchet can't see

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.429 
so like I'm saying ratchet can't see
these<00:02:48.700> guys<00:02:48.909> and<00:02:49.120> he<00:02:49.239> has<00:02:49.360> to<00:02:49.480> trust<00:02:49.750> clay<00:02:50.110> and

00:02:50.429 --> 00:02:50.439 
these guys and he has to trust clay and

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:52.289 
these guys and he has to trust clay and
Clank<00:02:51.159> is<00:02:51.310> telling<00:02:51.610> him<00:02:51.700> to<00:02:51.760> do<00:02:51.909> certain

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
with and that so it definitely causes a

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.110 
with and that so it definitely causes a
lot<00:02:56.349> of<00:02:56.409> tension<00:02:56.829> between<00:02:56.890> them<00:02:57.189> ratchet

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
lot of tension between them ratchet

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.610 
lot of tension between them ratchet
really<00:02:58.329> has<00:02:58.510> to<00:02:58.540> learn<00:02:58.780> how<00:02:58.840> to<00:02:59.049> trust<00:02:59.379> them

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
really has to learn how to trust them

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.360 
really has to learn how to trust them
throughout<00:03:01.140> so<00:03:02.140> by<00:03:02.319> pressing<00:03:02.709> X<00:03:02.829> by<00:03:03.069> the<00:03:03.129> way
