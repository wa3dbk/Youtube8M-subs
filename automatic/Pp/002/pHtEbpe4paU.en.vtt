00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
that dipstick just a little bit we can

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.470 
that dipstick just a little bit we can
see<00:02:16.550> how<00:02:17.550> full<00:02:18.209> our<00:02:18.570> oil<00:02:19.110> level<00:02:19.620> is<00:02:20.480> we're

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
see how full our oil level is we're

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.260 
see how full our oil level is we're
right<00:02:21.840> about<00:02:22.080> halfway<00:02:22.650> between<00:02:23.150> the<00:02:24.150> two<00:02:24.990> dots

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
right about halfway between the two dots

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.500 
right about halfway between the two dots
the<00:02:27.560> one<00:02:28.560> dot<00:02:28.770> is<00:02:28.980> identifying<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.970> minimum

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
the one dot is identifying the minimum

the one dot is identifying the minimum
level<00:02:31.010> the<00:02:32.010> other<00:02:32.160> dot<00:02:32.459> is<00:02:32.700> identifying<00:02:33.660> the

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
level the other dot is identifying the

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.590 
level the other dot is identifying the
maximum<00:02:34.709> level<00:02:34.950> that<00:02:35.400> you<00:02:35.610> want<00:02:35.850> your<00:02:36.030> oil<00:02:36.060> to

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
maximum level that you want your oil to

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.120 
maximum level that you want your oil to
be<00:02:36.750> we<00:02:37.080> are<00:02:37.230> right<00:02:37.530> in<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.860> middle<00:02:40.130> another

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
be we are right in the middle another

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.280 
be we are right in the middle another
thing<00:02:41.370> I<00:02:41.459> look<00:02:41.670> for<00:02:41.700> is<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.360> color<00:02:42.570> of<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.050> oil

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
thing I look for is the color of the oil

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.970 
thing I look for is the color of the oil
if<00:02:43.680> I<00:02:44.250> take<00:02:44.550> this<00:02:44.760> oil<00:02:45.120> and<00:02:45.680> put<00:02:46.680> a<00:02:46.739> little<00:02:46.860> bit

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
if I take this oil and put a little bit

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.500 
if I take this oil and put a little bit
on<00:02:47.160> my<00:02:47.310> finger<00:02:47.730> it<00:02:48.450> is<00:02:48.510> a<00:02:48.750> nice<00:02:49.640> kind<00:02:50.640> of<00:02:50.820> clear

black<00:03:01.080> that<00:03:01.950> means<00:03:02.220> it's<00:03:02.430> very<00:03:02.870> dirty<00:03:03.870> and

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
black that means it's very dirty and

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.979 
black that means it's very dirty and
time<00:03:04.799> for<00:03:05.010> an<00:03:05.100> oil<00:03:05.280> change<00:03:05.720> now<00:03:06.720> it<00:03:06.870> is

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
time for an oil change now it is

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.280 
time for an oil change now it is
important<00:03:07.530> to<00:03:07.590> note<00:03:07.920> that<00:03:08.750> the<00:03:09.750> distance

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
important to note that the distance

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.550 
important to note that the distance
between<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:10.950> minimum<00:03:11.370> dot<00:03:12.090> and<00:03:12.450> the<00:03:13.080> maximum

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
between the minimum dot and the maximum

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.750 
between the minimum dot and the maximum
dot<00:03:14.180> equals<00:03:15.180> one<00:03:15.600> quart<00:03:16.080> of<00:03:16.170> oil<00:03:16.410> so<00:03:17.370> if<00:03:17.519> you're

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
dot equals one quart of oil so if you're

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.289 
dot equals one quart of oil so if you're
on<00:03:17.970> the<00:03:18.000> minimum<00:03:18.600> dot<00:03:18.900> and<00:03:19.260> you<00:03:19.950> add<00:03:20.190> one<00:03:20.880> quart

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
on the minimum dot and you add one quart

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.539 
on the minimum dot and you add one quart
of<00:03:21.360> oil<00:03:21.570> that<00:03:22.140> should<00:03:22.200> fill<00:03:22.769> that<00:03:22.950> up<00:03:23.010> to<00:03:23.400> the

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
of oil that should fill that up to the

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:27.350 
of oil that should fill that up to the
maximum<00:03:23.970> dot<00:03:24.330> that's<00:03:25.430> fairly<00:03:26.430> standard<00:03:27.180> with

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
maximum dot that's fairly standard with

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.750 
maximum dot that's fairly standard with
most<00:03:27.390> vehicles<00:03:28.320> if<00:03:28.620> you're<00:03:29.340> not<00:03:29.459> quite<00:03:29.730> sure

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
most vehicles if you're not quite sure

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.699 
most vehicles if you're not quite sure
you<00:03:30.090> can<00:03:30.120> always<00:03:30.360> add<00:03:30.660> a<00:03:30.690> half<00:03:31.049> a<00:03:31.170> quart<00:03:31.470> and

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
you can always add a half a quart and

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.430 
you can always add a half a quart and
then<00:03:32.489> run<00:03:32.820> your<00:03:32.970> engine<00:03:33.120> for<00:03:33.360> fifteen<00:03:33.900> seconds

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
then run your engine for fifteen seconds

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.130 
then run your engine for fifteen seconds
check<00:03:35.070> it<00:03:35.190> again<00:03:35.459> and<00:03:35.810> see<00:03:36.810> where<00:03:36.959> you're<00:03:37.110> at

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
check it again and see where you're at

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.069 
check it again and see where you're at
after<00:03:38.100> you've<00:03:38.280> checked<00:03:38.730> your<00:03:39.000> oil<00:03:39.239> you<00:03:39.780> can

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
after you've checked your oil you can

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:45.860 
after you've checked your oil you can
replace<00:03:40.590> the<00:03:41.340> dipstick<00:03:43.760> if<00:03:44.760> you<00:03:45.390> are<00:03:45.540> low<00:03:45.840> on

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
replace the dipstick if you are low on

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.890 
replace the dipstick if you are low on
oil<00:03:46.320> you<00:03:46.860> want<00:03:47.040> to<00:03:47.280> locate<00:03:47.579> our<00:03:48.030> oil<00:03:48.420> fill<00:03:48.870> cap

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
oil you want to locate our oil fill cap

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.720 
oil you want to locate our oil fill cap
and<00:03:49.470> we<00:03:49.530> talked<00:03:49.769> about<00:03:49.890> that<00:03:50.160> one<00:03:50.370> how<00:03:50.549> that

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
and we talked about that one how that

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.600 
and we talked about that one how that
has<00:03:50.940> the<00:03:51.180> picture<00:03:51.570> of<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:52.140> oil<00:03:52.350> can<00:03:52.739> and<00:03:53.010> it

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
has the picture of the oil can and it

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.259 
has the picture of the oil can and it
says<00:03:54.290> 5w<00:03:55.290> 20<00:03:55.670> let's<00:03:56.670> go<00:03:56.820> ahead<00:03:56.910> and<00:03:57.120> remove

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
says 5w 20 let's go ahead and remove

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:01.130 
says 5w 20 let's go ahead and remove
that<00:03:57.620> this<00:03:58.620> particular<00:03:59.220> vehicle<00:03:59.459> requires<00:04:00.140> 5w

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
that this particular vehicle requires 5w

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.300 
that this particular vehicle requires 5w
20<00:04:01.530> so<00:04:02.160> I'm<00:04:02.250> using<00:04:02.459> AMSOIL<00:04:03.120> Signature<00:04:03.840> Series

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
20 so I'm using AMSOIL Signature Series

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.759 
20 so I'm using AMSOIL Signature Series
5w<00:04:05.310> 20<00:04:05.670> synthetic<00:04:06.360> motor<00:04:06.510> oil<00:04:06.840> and<00:04:07.079> you<00:04:07.590> could

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
5w 20 synthetic motor oil and you could

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:10.070 
5w 20 synthetic motor oil and you could
do<00:04:07.950> this<00:04:08.100> with<00:04:08.340> a<00:04:08.370> funnel<00:04:08.730> or<00:04:09.000> if<00:04:09.750> you<00:04:09.870> don't

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
do this with a funnel or if you don't

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.990 
do this with a funnel or if you don't
need<00:04:10.290> to<00:04:10.349> add<00:04:10.590> very<00:04:10.950> much<00:04:11.069> you<00:04:11.550> could<00:04:11.730> do<00:04:11.879> it

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
need to add very much you could do it

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.780 
need to add very much you could do it
just<00:04:12.180> by<00:04:12.510> tipping<00:04:12.900> the<00:04:13.140> oil

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
just by tipping the oil

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.160 
just by tipping the oil
if<00:04:15.769> you<00:04:16.769> have<00:04:16.889> good<00:04:17.070> aim<00:04:17.340> and<00:04:18.329> we're<00:04:18.959> going<00:04:19.079> to
