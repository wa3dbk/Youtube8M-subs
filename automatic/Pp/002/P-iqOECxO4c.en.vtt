 of errors he sees that there is nothing and therefore many times he is said to be customers of 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.390
 return as it appears too much and this is a waste of time for the 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.400
 our mechanic and also there is a nuisance. i'm more

 tool in addition let's say gone logo of the errors are the o 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.830
 the possibility of recalibrating the LPG systems and using the parameters 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.620
 sent by the lambda probe 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.210
 also allows cotral functions define cases must be monitored 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.680
 sudden acceleration sharp braking but any other parameter 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.870
 this tool can do

 how an old glass works 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.869
 the operation of this see is very simple just connect it to the PC 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.500
 set parameters that memorize the time and duration 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.300
 or even to you among the memorization comes save me on the whole of 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.390
 this tool icons from the predictable 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.270
 how it connects to the car

 connecting the bible is very simple, just open it

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.020
 as you can see we can make up for our journey by ha 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.529
 stored 

00:02:14.529 --> 00:02:17.479
 which reader is a single fig scroll 

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:19.529
 with all the parameters used stored 

00:02:19.529 --> 00:02:21.199
 as the journey 

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:24.329

 really a mistake 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:40.549
 selection of parameters section parameters in this item on the file 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:44.510
 if you add or remove the internal parameters of the store, the figs like them 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.659
 men are assholes 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:48.159
 on this screen

 maxim instead shows us 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:54.179
 for each item we say each parameter to select the maximum pain value
