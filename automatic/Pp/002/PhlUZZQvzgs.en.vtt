00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
slip by us they can't get out of this

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.470 
slip by us they can't get out of this
room<00:04:14.750> you<00:04:15.750> may<00:04:15.930> be<00:04:15.990> able<00:04:16.140> to<00:04:16.290> get<00:04:16.640> on<00:04:17.640> top<00:04:18.239> of

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
room you may be able to get on top of

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.000 
room you may be able to get on top of
the<00:04:18.720> cages<00:04:19.109> but<00:04:19.230> they<00:04:19.350> can't<00:04:19.560> get<00:04:19.709> over<00:04:19.859> the

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
the cages but they can't get over the

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.890 
the cages but they can't get over the
building<00:04:20.280> so<00:04:20.549> we're<00:04:21.330> all<00:04:21.510> set<00:04:21.740> awesome

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
building so we're all set awesome

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.780 
building so we're all set awesome
directly<00:04:24.900> in<00:04:25.050> front<00:04:25.080> of<00:04:25.320> us<00:04:25.470> we<00:04:25.680> have<00:04:25.920> a<00:04:26.220> very

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
directly in front of us we have a very

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.260 
directly in front of us we have a very
large<00:04:27.060> shoot<00:04:28.020> and<00:04:28.230> so<00:04:28.770> we<00:04:29.490> can<00:04:29.640> actually<00:04:29.790> move

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
large shoot and so we can actually move

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.060 
large shoot and so we can actually move
there's<00:04:30.630> from<00:04:30.990> one<00:04:31.200> enclosure<00:04:31.530> to<00:04:31.830> the<00:04:31.920> other

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
there's from one enclosure to the other

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.920 
there's from one enclosure to the other
enclosure<00:04:32.490> without<00:04:33.090> having<00:04:33.330> to<00:04:33.450> go<00:04:33.480> in<00:04:33.750> there

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
enclosure without having to go in there

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.170 
enclosure without having to go in there
and<00:04:34.110> chase<00:04:34.320> them<00:04:34.500> around<00:04:34.590> so<00:04:35.370> as<00:04:35.550> you<00:04:35.610> can<00:04:35.790> see

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
and chase them around so as you can see

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.850 
and chase them around so as you can see
we<00:04:37.110> have<00:04:37.290> a<00:04:38.180> full<00:04:39.180> system<00:04:39.570> here<00:04:39.810> so<00:04:40.020> we<00:04:40.140> can<00:04:40.290> let

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
we have a full system here so we can let

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:49.430 
we have a full system here so we can let
that<00:04:40.890> go<00:04:44.330> close<00:04:45.330> the<00:04:45.540> gate

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.690 

that<00:04:50.440> in<00:04:50.530> place<00:04:50.740> we'll<00:04:51.100> have<00:04:51.190> a<00:04:51.220> carabiner

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:51.700 
that in place we'll have a carabiner

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.000 
that in place we'll have a carabiner
here<00:04:52.000> to<00:04:52.120> keep<00:04:52.240> them<00:04:52.450> all<00:04:52.600> together<00:04:52.720> and<00:04:53.350> they

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
here to keep them all together and they

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.850 
here to keep them all together and they
can't<00:04:54.250> get<00:04:54.400> it<00:04:54.520> nice<00:04:54.970> and<00:04:55.570> the<00:04:56.440> same<00:04:56.590> thing<00:04:56.770> on

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
can't get it nice and the same thing on

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.460 
can't get it nice and the same thing on
the<00:04:56.950> other<00:04:56.980> side<00:04:57.100> we<00:04:57.730> also<00:04:57.940> have<00:04:58.270> another<00:04:59.230> gate

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
the other side we also have another gate

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:00.990 
the other side we also have another gate
that<00:04:59.800> goes<00:04:59.920> into<00:05:00.190> the<00:05:00.310> double<00:05:00.520> door<00:05:00.670> system

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
that goes into the double door system

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.360 
that goes into the double door system
and<00:05:01.180> the<00:05:02.140> double<00:05:02.350> door<00:05:02.500> or<00:05:02.860> that<00:05:02.980> this<00:05:03.160> chute

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
and the double door or that this chute

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.520 
and the double door or that this chute
will<00:05:03.550> actually<00:05:03.880> double<00:05:04.300> as<00:05:04.480> a<00:05:04.780> place<00:05:05.320> to

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
will actually double as a place to

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.100 
will actually double as a place to
attract<00:05:06.370> bears<00:05:06.580> so<00:05:06.940> we<00:05:07.060> can<00:05:07.180> dart<00:05:07.360> them<00:05:07.540> so<00:05:07.960> we

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
attract bears so we can dart them so we

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.020 
attract bears so we can dart them so we
can<00:05:08.230> very<00:05:08.410> easily<00:05:08.470> get<00:05:09.220> one<00:05:09.430> bearing<00:05:09.790> here

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.030 
can very easily get one bearing here

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.610 
can very easily get one bearing here
they're<00:05:10.600> at<00:05:10.690> it<00:05:10.810> and<00:05:10.930> then<00:05:11.140> take<00:05:11.440> it<00:05:11.530> out

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
they're at it and then take it out

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.440 
they're at it and then take it out
through<00:05:12.010> this<00:05:12.130> door<00:05:12.400> hmm<00:05:12.880> i'm<00:05:12.970> having<00:05:13.240> to<00:05:13.330> go

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.450 
through this door hmm i'm having to go

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:15.750 
through this door hmm i'm having to go
into<00:05:13.780> their<00:05:14.020> pens<00:05:14.230> on<00:05:14.410> either<00:05:14.500> side<00:05:14.800> so<00:05:15.370> this

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760 
into their pens on either side so this

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.150 
into their pens on either side so this
will<00:05:15.910> be<00:05:16.000> really<00:05:16.120> nice<00:05:16.330> be<00:05:16.480> German<00:05:16.780> very<00:05:16.900> nice

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:25.780 
started into moving in a left to right

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.230 
started into moving in a left to right
direction<00:06:26.230> from<00:06:26.530> then<00:06:26.770> where<00:06:26.920> the<00:06:27.010> doors<00:06:27.240> so

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 
direction from then where the doors so

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.100 
direction from then where the doors so
really<00:06:28.720> having<00:06:29.050> both<00:06:29.200> the<00:06:29.350> doors<00:06:31.110> open

really having both the doors open

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:33.900 
really having both the doors open
there's<00:06:32.680> one<00:06:32.740> on<00:06:33.040> top<00:06:33.280> and<00:06:33.490> one<00:06:33.670> on<00:06:33.700> the<00:06:33.820> bottom

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:33.910 
there's one on top and one on the bottom

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:35.310 
there's one on top and one on the bottom
so<00:06:34.330> that<00:06:34.360> there<00:06:34.600> is<00:06:34.720> won't<00:06:34.870> be<00:06:34.960> able<00:06:35.050> to<00:06:35.140> break

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:35.320 
so that there is won't be able to break

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.370 
so that there is won't be able to break
it<00:06:35.500> next<00:06:36.160> nice<00:06:36.760> heavy<00:06:37.060> door<00:06:37.240> can't<00:06:37.690> access<00:06:38.140> it

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:38.380 
it next nice heavy door can't access it

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:42.060 
it next nice heavy door can't access it
yeah<00:06:38.860> back<00:06:39.100> from<00:06:39.370> they<00:06:39.880> can<00:06:40.120> access<00:06:40.330> it<00:06:41.070> that's

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:42.070 
yeah back from they can access it that's

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:43.650 
yeah back from they can access it that's
a<00:06:42.250> really<00:06:42.460> good<00:06:42.550> point<00:06:42.730> what<00:06:43.120> you<00:06:43.300> see<00:06:43.510> around

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:43.660 
a really good point what you see around

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.780 
a really good point what you see around
edges<00:06:44.380> of<00:06:44.590> the<00:06:44.740> inside<00:06:45.070> of<00:06:45.100> these<00:06:45.310> enclosures

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:45.790 
edges of the inside of these enclosures

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:49.530 
edges of the inside of these enclosures
a<00:06:46.290> piece<00:06:47.290> of<00:06:47.320> two<00:06:47.740> foot<00:06:47.950> plywood<00:06:48.370> all<00:06:48.520> the<00:06:49.420> way

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:49.540 
a piece of two foot plywood all the way

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.090 
a piece of two foot plywood all the way
around<00:06:49.630> it<00:06:49.990> set<00:06:50.320> four<00:06:50.620> feet<00:06:50.800> off<00:06:50.830> the<00:06:50.980> ground

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:51.100 
around it set four feet off the ground

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:54.150 
around it set four feet off the ground
and<00:06:51.520> the<00:06:52.060> idea<00:06:52.450> is<00:06:52.720> that<00:06:52.810> it<00:06:53.590> will<00:06:53.710> prevent<00:06:53.980> the

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:54.160 
and the idea is that it will prevent the

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.370 
and the idea is that it will prevent the
bear<00:06:54.310> cops<00:06:54.580> from<00:06:54.760> climbing<00:06:55.180> to<00:06:55.360> high<00:06:55.390> getting

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:56.380 
bear cops from climbing to high getting

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.950 
bear cops from climbing to high getting
up<00:06:56.980> in<00:06:57.160> the<00:06:57.280> top<00:06:57.490> corners<00:06:58.000> where<00:06:58.570> they<00:06:58.750> might

00:06:58.950 --> 00:06:58.960 
up in the top corners where they might

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.400 
up in the top corners where they might
get<00:06:59.260> access<00:06:59.650> to<00:07:00.270> the<00:07:01.270> camera<00:07:01.690> up<00:07:01.930> in<00:07:02.170> the<00:07:02.260> top

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:02.410 
get access to the camera up in the top

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:05.130 
get access to the camera up in the top
corner<00:07:02.650> or<00:07:03.160> they<00:07:03.550> may<00:07:03.700> get<00:07:04.090> to<00:07:04.210> a<00:07:04.270> distance<00:07:04.630> off

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:05.140 
corner or they may get to a distance off

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:06.870 
corner or they may get to a distance off
the<00:07:05.200> ground<00:07:05.500> and<00:07:05.650> then<00:07:05.830> fall<00:07:06.100> this<00:07:06.610> is<00:07:06.760> all

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:06.880 
the ground and then fall this is all

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.490 
the ground and then fall this is all
going<00:07:07.030> to<00:07:07.120> be<00:07:07.240> covered<00:07:07.540> and<00:07:07.660> strong<00:07:08.020> when<00:07:08.440> the

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:08.500 
going to be covered and strong when the

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.560 
going to be covered and strong when the
Bears<00:07:08.680> are<00:07:08.860> here<00:07:09.070> so<00:07:10.060> that's<00:07:10.210> going<00:07:10.390> to<00:07:10.450> be<00:07:10.540> a

Bears are here so that's going to be a

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:12.030 
Bears are here so that's going to be a
bit<00:07:10.750> of<00:07:10.810> a<00:07:10.870> cushion<00:07:11.050> but<00:07:11.350> we<00:07:11.650> thought<00:07:11.770> we'd<00:07:11.950> try

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:12.040 
bit of a cushion but we thought we'd try

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.320 
bit of a cushion but we thought we'd try
to<00:07:12.100> prevent<00:07:12.370> them<00:07:12.550> from<00:07:12.580> finding<00:07:12.880> too<00:07:13.180> much

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:13.330 
to prevent them from finding too much

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:14.610 
to prevent them from finding too much
that's<00:07:13.480> have<00:07:13.630> anything<00:07:13.810> I<00:07:14.080> think<00:07:14.380> we're<00:07:14.470> now
