good to go and I'm going to give you two
different<00:00:47.520> versions<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:48.210> original<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.900> a

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
different versions the original and a

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.100 
different versions the original and a
slightly<00:00:49.920> simplified<00:00:50.430> version<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.300> it'll

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
slightly simplified version and it'll

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.990 
slightly simplified version and it'll
make<00:00:52.200> sense<00:00:52.440> once<00:00:52.740> we<00:00:52.890> get<00:00:53.010> into<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.400> I'm<00:00:53.790> going

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
make sense once we get into it I'm going

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.090 
make sense once we get into it I'm going
to<00:00:54.060> show<00:00:54.239> you<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.690> simplified<00:00:55.260> version<00:00:55.290> first

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
to show you the simplified version first

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.430 
to show you the simplified version first
and<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:56.940> sounds<00:00:57.270> almost<00:00:57.480> exactly<00:00:58.260> like<00:00:58.380> the

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
and it sounds almost exactly like the

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.690 
and it sounds almost exactly like the
original<00:00:58.950> but<00:00:59.489> it's<00:00:59.670> much<00:00:59.910> easier<00:01:00.300> so<00:01:01.489> here<00:01:02.489> is

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:02.700 
original but it's much easier so here is

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.219 
original but it's much easier so here is
the<00:01:02.940> first<00:01:03.120> chord<00:01:04.040> start<00:01:05.040> here<00:01:05.250> on<00:01:05.280> this<00:01:05.549> e

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
the first chord start here on this e

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:11.120 
the first chord start here on this e
skip<00:01:07.229> skip<00:01:08.720> okay<00:01:09.720> so<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:10.470> want<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.799> just<00:01:10.920> find

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
skip skip okay so you want to just find

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.690 
skip skip okay so you want to just find
this

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
this

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.249 
this
the<00:01:13.060> next<00:01:13.330> thing<00:01:13.450> that<00:01:13.479> happens<00:01:13.900> is<00:01:14.110> the

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:14.259 
the next thing that happens is the

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:17.990 
the next thing that happens is the
bottom<00:01:14.680> note<00:01:14.890> just<00:01:15.520> goes<00:01:15.729> down<00:01:16.030> one<00:01:16.390> note<00:01:16.630> you

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
bottom note just goes down one note you

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.870 
bottom note just goes down one note you
use<00:01:19.000> whichever<00:01:19.330> finger<00:01:19.750> you<00:01:19.869> want<00:01:19.990> here<00:01:20.880> next

use whichever finger you want here next

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.179 
use whichever finger you want here next
the<00:01:22.240> middle<00:01:22.600> note<00:01:22.780> changes<00:01:23.380> and<00:01:23.619> it<00:01:23.799> goes<00:01:23.979> to

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:24.189 
the middle note changes and it goes to

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:28.380 
the middle note changes and it goes to
this<00:01:24.280> black<00:01:24.640> key<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:26.700> then<00:01:27.700> the<00:01:27.880> top<00:01:28.119> note

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
this black key and then the top note

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.899 
this black key and then the top note
changes<00:01:28.659> and<00:01:29.170> it<00:01:29.619> comes<00:01:29.950> down<00:01:30.190> to<00:01:30.430> this<00:01:30.640> white

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
changes and it comes down to this white

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:35.570 
changes and it comes down to this white
key<00:01:32.190> and<00:01:33.190> that's<00:01:33.369> it<00:01:33.549> so<00:01:34.509> it's<00:01:34.659> this<00:01:34.810> one

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
key and that's it so it's this one

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.090 
key and that's it so it's this one
bottom<00:01:36.580> note<00:01:36.729> goes<00:01:36.939> down<00:01:37.920> middle<00:01:38.920> note

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
bottom note goes down middle note

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.510 
bottom note goes down middle note
changes<00:01:40.200> top<00:01:41.200> note<00:01:41.500> changes

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
changes top note changes

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.649 
changes top note changes
and<00:01:43.820> then<00:01:44.329> you<00:01:44.420> go<00:01:44.540> back<00:01:45.369> okay<00:01:46.369> now<00:01:46.579> what<00:01:47.570> you

and then you go back okay now what you
do<00:01:47.810> with<00:01:47.840> the<00:01:48.049> pattern<00:01:48.380> is<00:01:48.759> you<00:01:49.759> do<00:01:49.880> the<00:01:49.909> bottom

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
do with the pattern is you do the bottom

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:56.609 
do with the pattern is you do the bottom
note<00:01:50.950> top<00:01:51.950> middle<00:01:52.909> top<00:01:54.189> and<00:01:55.189> you<00:01:55.310> do<00:01:55.460> it<00:01:55.580> twice

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
note top middle top and you do it twice

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:03.149 
note top middle top and you do it twice
then<00:01:57.619> you<00:01:57.740> change<00:01:58.270> bottom

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:10.780 

and<00:02:04.159> change<00:02:04.460> the<00:02:04.610> middle<00:02:04.850> now<00:02:05.030> too

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:16.370 

ages<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:11.940> top<00:02:12.120> node<00:02:14.450> now<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.930> original

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
ages the top node now the original

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.470 
ages the top node now the original
version<00:02:16.740> it<00:02:16.920> actually<00:02:17.490> adds<00:02:17.670> an<00:02:18.800> octave<00:02:19.800> of

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
version it actually adds an octave of

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.670 
version it actually adds an octave of
the<00:02:21.480> bottom<00:02:22.080> node<00:02:22.320> here<00:02:23.750> so<00:02:24.750> you<00:02:25.320> actually

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
the bottom node here so you actually

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.550 
the bottom node here so you actually
reach<00:02:25.920> all<00:02:26.190> of<00:02:26.460> this<00:02:27.020> okay<00:02:28.020> but<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.350> same

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
reach all of this okay but the same

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.580 
reach all of this okay but the same
thing<00:02:28.830> happens<00:02:29.250> and<00:02:29.910> this<00:02:30.810> top<00:02:31.110> note<00:02:31.380> is

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
thing happens and this top note is

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.260 
thing happens and this top note is
basically<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:32.100> same<00:02:32.340> as<00:02:32.580> whatever<00:02:33.090> the

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
basically the same as whatever the

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.500 
basically the same as whatever the
bottom<00:02:33.660> note<00:02:33.840> is<00:02:33.990> so<00:02:34.200> it's<00:02:34.350> this<00:02:34.470> chord<00:02:34.800> and

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
bottom note is so it's this chord and

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.090 
bottom note is so it's this chord and
the<00:02:36.510> bottom<00:02:36.810> note<00:02:36.959> moves<00:02:37.230> down<00:02:37.470> which<00:02:37.770> is<00:02:37.920> also

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
the bottom note moves down which is also

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.230 
the bottom note moves down which is also
this<00:02:39.060> top<00:02:39.330> one<00:02:40.400> and<00:02:41.400> then<00:02:41.550> remember<00:02:41.880> this<00:02:42.030> one

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
this top one and then remember this one

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.960 
this top one and then remember this one
changes<00:02:42.920> and<00:02:43.920> then<00:02:44.700> this<00:02:44.880> one<00:02:45.120> changes

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.940 

and<00:02:48.510> then<00:02:48.630> you<00:02:48.750> go<00:02:48.870> back

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
and then you go back

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.660 
and then you go back
okay<00:02:51.980> so<00:02:52.250> practice<00:02:52.610> doing<00:02:52.880> this<00:02:53.060> first<00:02:54.670> change

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
okay so practice doing this first change

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:03.030 
okay so practice doing this first change
these<00:02:57.100> change<00:02:58.100> this<00:02:58.400> one<00:02:59.680> change<00:03:00.680> this<00:03:00.920> one

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
these change this one change this one

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.060 
these change this one change this one
and<00:03:04.040> in<00:03:04.580> the<00:03:04.700> pattern<00:03:04.910> just<00:03:05.540> like<00:03:05.950> we<00:03:06.950> were

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
and in the pattern just like we were

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.570 
and in the pattern just like we were
doing<00:03:07.310> in<00:03:07.430> this<00:03:07.490> simplified<00:03:08.030> version

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
doing in this simplified version

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.530 
doing in this simplified version
you<00:03:10.150> add<00:03:10.360> any<00:03:10.750> time<00:03:11.110> this<00:03:11.620> one<00:03:11.920> place<00:03:12.300> this<00:03:13.300> one

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
you add any time this one place this one

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.190 
you add any time this one place this one
place

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.900 

but<00:03:17.200> then<00:03:17.349> it<00:03:17.470> also<00:03:17.650> plays<00:03:18.069> on<00:03:18.250> that<00:03:18.489> one<00:03:18.700> okay

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
but then it also plays on that one okay

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.550 
but then it also plays on that one okay
so<00:03:19.239> it's<00:03:19.630> a<00:03:19.690> little<00:03:19.780> bit<00:03:19.959> tricky<00:03:20.260> for<00:03:20.290> some

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
so it's a little bit tricky for some

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.010 
so it's a little bit tricky for some
people<00:03:20.890> if<00:03:21.700> it's<00:03:21.819> too<00:03:21.970> tricky<00:03:22.180> I<00:03:22.510> would<00:03:22.870> just

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.020 
people if it's too tricky I would just

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.110 
people if it's too tricky I would just
do<00:03:23.140> this<00:03:23.290> simplified<00:03:23.830> version<00:03:24.250> okay<00:03:24.819> but<00:03:25.060> if

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
do this simplified version okay but if

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.720 
do this simplified version okay but if
you<00:03:25.209> want<00:03:25.390> to<00:03:25.480> be<00:03:25.599> true<00:03:25.870> to<00:03:26.080> the<00:03:26.170> original<00:03:26.730> you

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
you want to be true to the original you

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:33.600 
you want to be true to the original you
do<00:03:27.880> it<00:03:27.970> this<00:03:28.090> way<00:03:32.099> okay<00:03:33.099> so<00:03:33.160> that's<00:03:33.489> the

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
do it this way okay so that's the

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.920 
do it this way okay so that's the
pattern<00:03:34.000> though<00:03:34.260> these<00:03:35.260> go<00:03:35.650> at<00:03:35.769> the<00:03:35.860> same<00:03:36.010> time

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
pattern though these go at the same time

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:43.089 
pattern though these go at the same time
and<00:03:37.930> then<00:03:38.110> these<00:03:38.319> go<00:03:38.560> at<00:03:38.709> the<00:03:38.830> same<00:03:38.980> time

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:43.099 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:47.850 

change

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.839 

change

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:51.849 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:59.000 

change<00:03:55.439> back<00:03:56.439> first

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.020 

okay<00:03:59.909> now<00:04:00.269> let<00:04:00.870> me<00:04:00.959> show<00:04:01.140> you<00:04:01.170> a<00:04:02.129> part<00:04:02.549> later<00:04:02.760> in

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
okay now let me show you a part later in

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.880 
okay now let me show you a part later in
the<00:04:03.120> song<00:04:03.329> the<00:04:03.780> the<00:04:04.140> coolest<00:04:04.349> part<00:04:04.680> that's

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
the song the the coolest part that's

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.619 
the song the the coolest part that's
everyone's<00:04:05.220> favorite<00:04:05.640> and<00:04:05.790> I'm<00:04:06.239> going<00:04:06.390> to<00:04:06.480> do

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:06.629 
everyone's favorite and I'm going to do

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:08.179 
everyone's favorite and I'm going to do
it<00:04:06.750> with<00:04:07.230> the<00:04:07.500> left<00:04:07.680> hand

00:04:08.179 --> 00:04:08.189 
it with the left hand

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:10.610 
it with the left hand
simplified<00:04:08.760> version<00:04:09.209> pattern<00:04:09.959> and<00:04:10.140> then<00:04:10.470> the

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
simplified version pattern and then the

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.289 
simplified version pattern and then the
left<00:04:10.829> hand<00:04:10.950> original<00:04:11.459> version<00:04:11.819> and<00:04:11.970> you'll

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
left hand original version and you'll

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:13.910 
left hand original version and you'll
see<00:04:12.480> it's<00:04:12.659> pretty<00:04:12.720> much<00:04:13.319> sounds<00:04:13.739> almost

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
see it's pretty much sounds almost

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.150 
see it's pretty much sounds almost
exactly<00:04:14.459> the<00:04:14.640> same<00:04:14.849> okay<00:04:15.690> so<00:04:15.959> here<00:04:16.859> is<00:04:17.130> the

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
exactly the same okay so here is the

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.490 
exactly the same okay so here is the
original<00:04:17.850> version<00:04:18.209> with<00:04:18.570> a<00:04:18.959> little<00:04:19.350> more

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
original version with a little more

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.430 
original version with a little more
complicated<00:04:19.859> pattern<00:04:20.430> here<00:04:20.789> and<00:04:20.910> then<00:04:21.750> I'll

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
complicated pattern here and then I'll

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.170 
complicated pattern here and then I'll
teach<00:04:22.770> you<00:04:22.889> this<00:04:23.010> right<00:04:23.250> hand<00:04:23.460> part<00:04:23.639> later<00:04:23.880> but

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
teach you this right hand part later but

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:37.230 
teach you this right hand part later but
this<00:04:24.270> is<00:04:24.330> just<00:04:24.570> an<00:04:24.690> example<00:04:24.840> okay<00:04:25.560> here<00:04:25.770> we<00:04:25.860> go

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.080 

and<00:04:37.949> here's<00:04:38.949> the<00:04:39.069> same<00:04:39.250> thing<00:04:39.310> but<00:04:39.850> now<00:04:40.000> I'm

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
and here's the same thing but now I'm

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.640 
and here's the same thing but now I'm
going<00:04:40.210> to<00:04:40.300> do<00:04:40.389> the<00:04:40.509> simplified<00:04:41.020> version<00:04:41.500> of

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
going to do the simplified version of

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:54.720 
going to do the simplified version of
the<00:04:41.919> left<00:04:42.130> hand

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:54.730 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.790 

we<00:04:55.730> notice<00:04:56.090> it<00:04:56.300> still<00:04:56.570> sounds<00:04:56.990> almost<00:04:57.230> exactly

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
we notice it still sounds almost exactly

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.350 
we notice it still sounds almost exactly
the<00:04:57.950> same<00:04:57.980> because<00:04:58.460> this<00:04:58.669> is<00:04:58.790> the<00:04:58.910> main<00:04:59.060> one

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
the same because this is the main one

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.840 
the same because this is the main one
and<00:04:59.600> this<00:04:59.840> is<00:04:59.900> the<00:05:00.020> background<00:05:00.620> pattern<00:05:01.040> okay

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:01.850 
and this is the background pattern okay

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.930 
and this is the background pattern okay
some<00:05:02.180> of<00:05:02.210> my<00:05:02.419> students<00:05:03.050> they<00:05:03.860> prefer<00:05:04.280> the

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
some of my students they prefer the

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.390 
some of my students they prefer the
simplified<00:05:05.480> one<00:05:05.780> and<00:05:06.560> then<00:05:06.710> you<00:05:06.860> can<00:05:06.889> add<00:05:07.160> the

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
simplified one and then you can add the

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.120 
simplified one and then you can add the
other<00:05:07.790> one<00:05:07.970> later<00:05:08.120> so<00:05:08.960> you<00:05:09.050> decide<00:05:09.770> you<00:05:10.010> can

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
other one later so you decide you can

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:11.950 
other one later so you decide you can
practice<00:05:10.400> whichever<00:05:10.730> one<00:05:10.940> you<00:05:11.090> want<00:05:11.240> okay<00:05:11.750> but

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
practice whichever one you want okay but

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.530 
practice whichever one you want okay but
get<00:05:12.110> that<00:05:12.260> left<00:05:12.470> hand<00:05:12.710> one<00:05:12.889> first<00:05:13.190> and<00:05:13.520> then<00:05:14.180> we

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:14.540 
get that left hand one first and then we

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.620 
get that left hand one first and then we
will<00:05:14.570> go<00:05:14.870> on<00:05:15.050> and<00:05:15.410> I'll<00:05:15.860> begin<00:05:16.669> teaching<00:05:17.360> you

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.630 
will go on and I'll begin teaching you

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:24.650 
will go on and I'll begin teaching you
the<00:05:17.840> different<00:05:18.139> right<00:05:18.260> hand<00:05:18.470> parts

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.620 

first<00:05:25.200> thing<00:05:25.620> that<00:05:25.650> happens<00:05:26.100> in<00:05:26.220> the

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:26.630 
first thing that happens in the

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.430 
first thing that happens in the
comes<00:05:26.930> in<00:05:27.190> you're<00:05:28.190> going<00:05:28.340> to<00:05:28.400> step<00:05:28.700> right<00:05:28.880> here

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 
comes in you're going to step right here
