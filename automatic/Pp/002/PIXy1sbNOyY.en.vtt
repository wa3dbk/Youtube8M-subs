and<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.719> best<00:02:00.990> way<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.229> kill<00:02:01.439> Knight<00:02:01.619> logic<00:02:01.950> in

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
and the best way to kill Knight logic in

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.560 
and the best way to kill Knight logic in
my<00:02:02.219> opinion<00:02:02.610> since<00:02:02.759> his<00:02:02.939> attacks<00:02:03.210> are<00:02:03.420> pretty

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
my opinion since his attacks are pretty

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.410 
my opinion since his attacks are pretty
much<00:02:03.840> unblockable<00:02:04.439> is<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:05.369> just<00:02:05.729> parry<00:02:06.210> him

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
much unblockable is to just parry him

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.809 
much unblockable is to just parry him
and<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:07.439> best<00:02:07.619> way<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:07.770> parry<00:02:08.069> him<00:02:08.220> is<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:08.640> just

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
and the best way to parry him is to just

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.369 
and the best way to parry him is to just
hit<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.090> parry<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:09.599> if<00:02:09.720> your<00:02:09.840> parry<00:02:10.050> fails

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
hit the parry and if your parry fails

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.080 
hit the parry and if your parry fails
the<00:02:10.619> first<00:02:10.649> time<00:02:11.069> like<00:02:11.459> on<00:02:11.610> his<00:02:11.730> first<00:02:11.940> swing

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
the first time like on his first swing

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.730 
the first time like on his first swing
keep<00:02:12.810> hitting<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:13.170> parry<00:02:13.379> button

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
keep hitting the parry button

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.470 
keep hitting the parry button
and<00:02:13.800> it'll<00:02:14.010> work<00:02:14.220> on<00:02:14.490> a<00:02:14.520> second<00:02:14.970> swing<00:02:15.210> as<00:02:15.360> you

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
and it'll work on a second swing as you

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.210 
and it'll work on a second swing as you
can<00:02:15.600> see<00:02:15.750> me<00:02:15.900> doing<00:02:16.050> it<00:02:16.230> here<00:02:16.530> and<00:02:16.680> just

can see me doing it here and just

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.100 
can see me doing it here and just
continue<00:02:17.610> doing<00:02:17.760> that<00:02:18.030> until<00:02:18.570> you<00:02:18.690> kill<00:02:18.900> night
