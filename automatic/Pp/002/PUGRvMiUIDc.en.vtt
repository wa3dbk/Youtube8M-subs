hi welcome to rotary smaller sports

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.589 
hi welcome to rotary smaller sports
today<00:00:08.269> we're<00:00:08.450> going<00:00:08.540> to<00:00:08.629> do<00:00:08.780> a<00:00:08.830> install<00:00:09.830> of<00:00:10.099> a

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:10.599 
today we're going to do a install of a

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:14.769 
today we're going to do a install of a
road<00:00:11.599> race<00:00:11.780> header<00:00:12.049> on<00:00:12.320> a<00:00:12.520> 2006<00:00:13.520> rally<00:00:13.850> art<00:00:14.090> we

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:14.779 
road race header on a 2006 rally art we

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:16.060 
road race header on a 2006 rally art we
just<00:00:14.930> wanted<00:00:15.080> to<00:00:15.170> take<00:00:15.320> a<00:00:15.379> quick<00:00:15.680> moment<00:00:15.799> and

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.070 
just wanted to take a quick moment and

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.650 
just wanted to take a quick moment and
show<00:00:16.189> you<00:00:16.250> the<00:00:16.640> difference<00:00:17.000> between<00:00:17.060> the<00:00:17.510> down

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:17.660 
show you the difference between the down

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.439 
show you the difference between the down
pipe<00:00:17.900> on<00:00:18.230> our<00:00:18.680> header<00:00:18.920> versus<00:00:19.880> the<00:00:19.970> stock<00:00:20.240> one

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:20.449 
pipe on our header versus the stock one

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:22.510 
pipe on our header versus the stock one
as<00:00:21.260> you<00:00:21.410> can<00:00:21.530> see<00:00:21.680> it<00:00:21.800> does<00:00:21.950> eliminate<00:00:22.130> the

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:22.520 
as you can see it does eliminate the

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.590 
as you can see it does eliminate the
catalytic<00:00:22.910> converter<00:00:22.970> which<00:00:23.360> is<00:00:23.390> where

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:23.600 
catalytic converter which is where

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.880 
catalytic converter which is where
you're<00:00:23.690> getting<00:00:23.780> all<00:00:23.990> your<00:00:24.170> performance<00:00:24.650> from

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
you're getting all your performance from

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.100 
you're getting all your performance from
relieving<00:00:25.580> that<00:00:25.699> back<00:00:25.880> pressure<00:00:26.150> and<00:00:26.869> also

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:27.110 
relieving that back pressure and also

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.400 
relieving that back pressure and also
getting<00:00:27.710> rid<00:00:27.830> of<00:00:27.860> some<00:00:28.039> of<00:00:28.130> the<00:00:28.190> bends<00:00:28.580> and<00:00:29.410> as

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
getting rid of some of the bends and as

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.229 
getting rid of some of the bends and as
you<00:00:30.710> can<00:00:30.860> see<00:00:31.100> the<00:00:31.250> diameter<00:00:31.400> looks<00:00:31.880> fairly

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
you can see the diameter looks fairly

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:34.450 
you can see the diameter looks fairly
equal<00:00:32.509> to<00:00:32.719> our<00:00:32.899> down<00:00:33.289> pipe<00:00:33.530> but<00:00:34.190> underneath

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
equal to our down pipe but underneath

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.000 
equal to our down pipe but underneath
these<00:00:34.670> heat<00:00:34.940> shields<00:00:35.329> not<00:00:36.140> sure<00:00:36.289> how<00:00:36.500> obvious

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
these heat shields not sure how obvious

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.950 
these heat shields not sure how obvious
it<00:00:37.190> is<00:00:37.250> this<00:00:37.879> Bend<00:00:38.149> is<00:00:38.210> actually<00:00:38.600> squished

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
it is this Bend is actually squished

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.340 
it is this Bend is actually squished
down<00:00:39.170> quite<00:00:39.589> a<00:00:39.620> bit<00:00:39.859> so<00:00:40.670> that<00:00:40.850> actually<00:00:41.350> slows

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
down quite a bit so that actually slows

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.590 
down quite a bit so that actually slows
down<00:00:42.710> your<00:00:42.920> exhaust<00:00:43.249> gases<00:00:43.760> that's<00:00:44.269> back

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
down your exhaust gases that's back

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.369 
down your exhaust gases that's back
pressure<00:00:45.190> so<00:00:46.389> all<00:00:47.389> of<00:00:47.600> our<00:00:47.690> down<00:00:47.870> pipettor

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379 
pressure so all of our down pipettor

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:50.469 
pressure so all of our down pipettor

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:50.479 
combos are nickel plated to eliminate

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:52.419 
combos are nickel plated to eliminate
any<00:00:50.659> issues<00:00:50.989> with<00:00:51.139> rust<00:00:51.409> as<00:00:51.859> you<00:00:52.010> can<00:00:52.129> see<00:00:52.309> it

00:00:52.419 --> 00:00:52.429 
any issues with rust as you can see it

nickel plated on the nickel plating will
change<00:01:14.780> color<00:01:15.050> after<00:01:15.380> a<00:01:15.800> while<00:01:15.920> it<00:01:16.100> will<00:01:16.160> turn

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:16.370 
change color after a while it will turn

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.500 
change color after a while it will turn
kind<00:01:16.610> of<00:01:16.670> a<00:01:16.730> purplish<00:01:17.890> bluish<00:01:18.890> hue<00:01:19.850> as<00:01:20.090> you<00:01:20.390> can

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:20.510 
kind of a purplish bluish hue as you can

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.080 
kind of a purplish bluish hue as you can
see<00:01:20.690> it's<00:01:20.870> a<00:01:20.960> four<00:01:21.170> to<00:01:21.350> one<00:01:21.380> header<00:01:22.370> design<00:01:22.580> and

back in 2000 to 2003 as far as the
installation<00:01:45.620> for<00:01:45.770> the<00:01:45.860> header<00:01:46.070> it's<00:01:46.460> fairly

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
installation for the header it's fairly

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.270 
installation for the header it's fairly
simple<00:01:47.240> you<00:01:47.960> just<00:01:48.320> need<00:01:48.800> to<00:01:48.890> make<00:01:49.010> sure<00:01:49.190> you

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
simple you just need to make sure you

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.010 
simple you just need to make sure you
have<00:01:49.400> basic<00:01:49.730> hand<00:01:49.909> tools<00:01:49.970> as<00:01:50.510> well<00:01:50.659> as<00:01:50.720> some

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
have basic hand tools as well as some

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.410 
have basic hand tools as well as some
wd-40<00:01:51.680> because<00:01:51.920> some<00:01:52.070> of<00:01:52.100> these<00:01:52.310> nuts<00:01:53.210> and

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
wd-40 because some of these nuts and

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.570 
wd-40 because some of these nuts and
bolts<00:01:53.659> do<00:01:53.810> tend<00:01:54.050> to<00:01:54.140> get<00:01:54.320> pretty<00:01:54.650> rusty<00:01:55.430> and

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
bolts do tend to get pretty rusty and

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.990 
bolts do tend to get pretty rusty and
stuck<00:01:56.000> on<00:01:56.210> there<00:01:57.909> so<00:01:58.909> that's

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
stuck on there so that's

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.780
