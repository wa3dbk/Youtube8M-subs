but<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.789> avoid<00:00:53.879> that<00:00:54.210> what<00:00:54.360> you<00:00:54.449> do<00:00:54.570> is<00:00:54.690> you

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
but to avoid that what you do is you

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.049 
but to avoid that what you do is you
just<00:00:54.809> separate<00:00:55.379> your<00:00:55.440> locus<00:00:56.010> so<00:00:56.309> that<00:00:56.550> they

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
just separate your locus so that they

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.060 
just separate your locus so that they
don't<00:00:57.270> die<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.930> marker<00:00:58.500> carpet<00:01:00.590> right<00:01:01.590> this

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
singh the active gun thing target the

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.200 
singh the active gun thing target the
base<00:04:20.200> so<00:04:21.310> let's<00:04:22.310> pretend<00:04:22.640> that<00:04:22.760> I<00:04:22.850> was<00:04:22.880> getting

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
base so let's pretend that I was getting

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.360 
base so let's pretend that I was getting
jacked<00:04:23.419> you<00:04:23.780> run<00:04:23.960> the<00:04:24.080> suicide<00:04:24.500> grunt<00:04:24.740> in<00:04:24.919> kill

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
jacked you run the suicide grunt in kill

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.610 
jacked you run the suicide grunt in kill
the<00:04:25.490> Spartan<00:04:25.970> then<00:04:26.540> then<00:04:26.960> the<00:04:27.080> back<00:04:27.230> has<00:04:27.440> gone

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
the Spartan then then the back has gone

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.950 
the Spartan then then the back has gone
they<00:04:27.770> can't<00:04:27.980> do<00:04:28.100> anything<00:04:28.130> and<00:04:28.880> also<00:04:29.150> drop

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
they can't do anything and also drop

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.680 
they can't do anything and also drop
ghosts<00:04:30.410> in<00:04:30.850> ghosts<00:04:31.850> so<00:04:32.030> good<00:04:32.210> because<00:04:32.390> they

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
ghosts in ghosts so good because they

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.140 
ghosts in ghosts so good because they
soak<00:04:33.169> up<00:04:33.320> damage<00:04:33.680> they<00:04:33.979> do<00:04:34.040> and<00:04:34.820> they<00:04:35.000> also

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
soak up damage they do and they also

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.330 
soak up damage they do and they also
stop<00:04:35.570> jacking<00:04:35.990> and<00:04:36.110> also<00:04:36.410> they<00:04:36.620> great<00:04:36.979> against

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
stop jacking and also they great against

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.740 
stop jacking and also they great against
flamers<00:04:39.130> so<00:04:40.130> the<00:04:40.400> others<00:04:41.000> could<00:04:41.330> have<00:04:41.450> queued

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
flamers so the others could have queued

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.480 
flamers so the others could have queued
up<00:04:41.810> some<00:04:42.050> fling<00:04:42.290> squads<00:04:42.560> by<00:04:42.740> now<00:04:42.919> and<00:04:43.250> have<00:04:43.460> a

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
up some fling squads by now and have a

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.680 
up some fling squads by now and have a
few<00:04:43.760> out<00:04:45.790> so<00:04:46.790> you<00:04:46.850> see<00:04:47.060> the<00:04:47.210> base<00:04:47.360> you<00:04:47.510> just

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
few out so you see the base you just

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.390 
few out so you see the base you just
getting<00:04:47.930> destroyed<00:04:48.320> remember<00:04:48.800> to<00:04:48.919> say<00:04:49.100> keep

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
getting destroyed remember to say keep

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.430 
getting destroyed remember to say keep
some<00:04:49.820> rage<00:04:50.030> money<00:04:50.270> behind<00:04:50.450> just<00:04:50.870> in<00:04:50.990> case<00:04:51.200> as

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
some rage money behind just in case as

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.050 
some rage money behind just in case as
well<00:04:53.410> right<00:04:54.410> now<00:04:54.440> that<00:04:54.860> Barrett<00:04:55.190> reactors<00:04:55.880> gun

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
well right now that Barrett reactors gun

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.900 
well right now that Barrett reactors gun
is<00:04:56.450> target<00:04:56.870> the<00:04:56.930> middle<00:04:57.200> I<00:04:57.350> what<00:04:58.340> beats<00:04:58.610> this

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
is target the middle I what beats this

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.380 
is target the middle I what beats this
strategy<00:04:59.360> is<00:04:59.540> a<00:05:00.410> lot<00:05:01.190> of<00:05:01.370> Marines<00:05:01.520> early<00:05:02.150> that

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:02.390 
strategy is a lot of Marines early that

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:03.850 
strategy is a lot of Marines early that
they<00:05:02.479> make<00:05:02.660> a<00:05:02.690> load<00:05:02.930> of<00:05:02.960> Marines<00:05:03.350> early<00:05:03.740> the

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
they make a load of Marines early the

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.590 
they make a load of Marines early the
apt<00:05:03.979> it<00:05:04.220> doesn't<00:05:04.490> have<00:05:04.610> enough<00:05:04.790> major<00:05:05.000> a<00:05:05.180> gym

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 
apt it doesn't have enough major a gym

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.080 
apt it doesn't have enough major a gym
ghosts<00:05:06.260> can't<00:05:06.350> sort<00:05:06.860> them<00:05:07.010> out<00:05:07.130> and<00:05:07.400> locust

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
ghosts can't sort them out and locust

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.540 
ghosts can't sort them out and locust
just<00:05:08.330> fail<00:05:09.229> against<00:05:09.560> them<00:05:09.830> so<00:05:10.100> lots<00:05:10.430> of

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
just fail against them so lots of

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.810 
just fail against them so lots of
Marines<00:05:10.760> early<00:05:11.120> beat<00:05:11.300> lift<00:05:12.460> but<00:05:13.460> that's<00:05:13.729> a

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 
Marines early beat lift but that's a

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.060 
Marines early beat lift but that's a
double-edged<00:05:14.210> sword<00:05:14.479> because<00:05:14.919> lots<00:05:15.919> of

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.070 
double-edged sword because lots of

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:17.680 
double-edged sword because lots of
Marines<00:05:16.340> early<00:05:16.729> isn't<00:05:17.000> really<00:05:17.479> a<00:05:17.540> good

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690 
Marines early isn't really a good

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.219 
Marines early isn't really a good
strategy<00:05:18.760> another<00:05:19.760> way<00:05:19.940> that<00:05:19.970> this<00:05:20.660> is<00:05:20.810> beaten

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:21.229 
strategy another way that this is beaten

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:22.719 
strategy another way that this is beaten
as<00:05:21.380> if<00:05:21.530> you<00:05:21.710> against<00:05:22.040> a<00:05:22.100> really<00:05:22.250> good<00:05:22.340> unders

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:22.729 
as if you against a really good unders

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:25.600 
as if you against a really good unders
player<00:05:22.910> they<00:05:23.150> can<00:05:23.330> balance<00:05:23.540> the<00:05:23.960> economy<00:05:24.610> very

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
player they can balance the economy very

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.400 
player they can balance the economy very
well<00:05:25.910> and<00:05:26.900> they<00:05:27.110> can<00:05:27.320> cry<00:05:27.590> or<00:05:27.740> Jack<00:05:28.060> your<00:05:29.060> am

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.410 
well and they can cry or Jack your am

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.320 
well and they can cry or Jack your am
locust<00:05:30.410> that's<00:05:30.650> when<00:05:30.830> you<00:05:30.950> freeze<00:05:31.330> locust

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330 
locust that's when you freeze locust

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.690 
locust that's when you freeze locust
then<00:05:32.540> Jacqueline<00:05:33.040> so<00:05:34.040> avoid<00:05:34.280> this<00:05:34.430> you<00:05:34.490> need

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:34.700 
then Jacqueline so avoid this you need

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.400 
then Jacqueline so avoid this you need
to<00:05:34.760> separate<00:05:35.240> your<00:05:35.330> is<00:05:35.660> put<00:05:35.870> them<00:05:35.990> up<00:05:36.140> as<00:05:36.320> it

to separate your is put them up as it

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:38.620 
to separate your is put them up as it
