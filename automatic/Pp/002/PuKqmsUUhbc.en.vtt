00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.580
 and the sponsor of this video is sins company so 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.630
 Hello dear friends with you Maxim 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.060
 elizar 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.060
 and today our hands got a gamepad from 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.920
 speed-link strike 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.580
 let's start by tradition unpack 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.220
 box see what's inside and 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:31.920
 we will proceed from this inside ourselves 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.520
 gamepad and instructions that are attached 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.980
 to him the instruction with pictures 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:41.070
 Russian language is present on the back 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.850
 side is the same only on others 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.739
 languages 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.579
 for now let's put it aside and 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.320
 look at the joystick itself 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:53.250
 gamepad is presented bright enough 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:57.570
 green to the touch is very nice 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.969
 I will clarify the material and I will say a little later on 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.309
 we have the back side 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:06.150
 small finger grooves to 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:09.479
 it was more comfortable to hold and wire length 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.799
 which is 19 meters this is more 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.430
 than enough 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.720
 the size of the gamepad is small enough 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.830
 palm sized 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:22.170
 weight is also small let's now 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.900
 look more tightly 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.560
 what is already a gamepad 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.780
 strike 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.880
 Well, gentlemen, here she tested 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.369
 our device and is now ready to share with 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.200
 your feelings and impressions in 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.960
 first of all it is certainly worth noting 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.090
 color but it is on my own green bright 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.990
 saturated beautiful here right at all 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.820
 indescribable beauty and even more there is 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.259
 one such feature is that in the dark he 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.450
 a little bit that is possible 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.920
 see how bright it is 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.360
 now about the technical 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.939
 characteristics well, everything is very simple 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.780
 this is a small gamepad which is nice 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.479
 sits in his arms 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.939
 thanks to these small recesses 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:03.170
 on the back side i have fingers 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:06.299
 lie in them and the ipad sits like a cast 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.819
 the only thing worth noting is that if 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.890
 you are used to gamepad more large 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.200
 sizes then 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.030
 the first couple of hours in games will be 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.180
 feel such a kind of discomfort 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:20.569
 but this passes hands cling hands 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:23.930
 get used and everything is great about 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:26.330
 buttons buttons here are standard back 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:30.590
 side four buttons on the front side 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:33.530
 cross select start abc then they 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:36.620
 designated as 1234 fungi 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:40.520
 analog sticks which also 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:43.370
 pressed with this no problem 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.650
 nothing new and surprising no button 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.410
 switching to tax regime too 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.239
 present now respectively 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.670
 each gamepad key 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:55.160
 weak detail weakest detail this 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.650
 Of course, fungi, that is, they can 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.560
 loose they can be damaged and 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.890
 work really bad here they are 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.150
 sit tight enough no 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.370
 all-time claims 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.040
 though not big enough but 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:13.790
 I used and tested the unit 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.650
 tough enough but key and the 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.350
 important detail that is present 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:21.170
 gamepad strike it is of course its price 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:24.890
 within 900 rubles can be purchased 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:27.980
 This device but for the money is not fungi 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:30.230
 no buttons none of this throws into 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.140
 eyes eyes or rather to the touch 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.360
 vibration rushes up gamepad 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.489
 there are election mode and this of course 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.530
 definitely the biggest plus 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:42.260
 for the money joystick with a gamepad 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:45.480
 get well you are almost impossible 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:49.470
 From the closest analogues well , I have 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:51.690
 Logitech joystick f310 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.580
 also looks like a pretty single 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.700
 the crosspiece is made here with one button 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:59.430
 and buttons a bc 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:02.400
 denoted precisely as a bc and 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:06.299
 rear triggers are exactly the triggers 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:09.390
 cups that is not like a button on a strike 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:11.730
 Of course they are made to the buttons are not with 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.840
 first time it was unusual but to 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.470
 this can also be used to 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:19.769
 the cross by the way works here too by 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.720
 to the same circular mode that is under 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.930
 this one 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.910
 there is a single solid cross 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:30.570
 a button, that is, you can press and will 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:32.490
 work both up up and right here in 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:35.430
 Basically the most key details 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.380
 let's still sum up and out 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.930
 totals here can be noted as pluses so 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.419
 and cons of cons probably worth 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.400
 note this rear triggers they 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:45.990
 work like buttons and look like 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.460
 buttons are pressed accordingly as 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:51.090
 no buttons buttons 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:54.900
 I was used to an unusual course but 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:56.610
 nevertheless also buttons 1234 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.130
 designate exactly as one two three 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:02.130
 four i used again kbc 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:05.160
 here is what this designation does 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:07.200
 there is now one of the advantages of the advantages of 1 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.419
 well, minor, I understand, but not 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.070
 less this color is green beautiful bright i 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:13.560
 already talked about this in the beginning to me he 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:16.470
 very well, like an amateur yet 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.150
 less I am satisfied about the vibration I already 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:22.020
 said for that kind of money 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:26.150
 Joystick vibro mode is just a bomb 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:28.979
 also worth noting directly 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:32.970
 reliability nothing stagger nothing 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:34.889
 hanging out and believe i did a lot 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:37.770
 so he 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:40.289
 underwent a small one big so 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:44.580
 crash test u with this all great everything 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:47.039
 good small size light weight 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.029
 allow you to comfortably hold your hands do not get tired 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:51.900
 even on weight 

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:56.249
 you can use no claims 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:59.400
 problems with this will not be for a long time 

00:05:56.249 --> 00:06:01.650
 here, too, everything is wonderful only 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.300
 what is worth noting probably not all games 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:05.520
 will work directly connecting 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.770
 gamepad i.e. some games need 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:11.310
 will use third-party software to 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:13.409
 everything worked well but it even with 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:19.169
 Many advanced joysticks have 

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:23.039
 such a problem since my logitech f310 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:25.740
 covered up the next games that I will 

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:28.889
 play it blockade zart from such 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:33.089
 unusual well do not read the race and mortal 

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:36.629
 kombat and all sorts of just try on the block 

00:06:33.089 --> 00:06:39.779
 d zade pass on soon streame soon 

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:41.870
 passing basically that's all thanks 

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:45.319
 for watching with you was maxim elizar 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:45.319
 bye everyone
