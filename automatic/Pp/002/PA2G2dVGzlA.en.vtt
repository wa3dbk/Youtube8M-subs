minutes<00:02:04.240> now<00:02:04.329> just<00:02:04.689> to<00:02:04.810> say

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
minutes now just to say

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.320 
minutes now just to say
ok<00:02:07.470> Tim<00:02:07.680> next<00:02:08.460> step<00:02:08.610> now<00:02:08.640> is<00:02:08.789> to<00:02:08.940> remove<00:02:09.270> the

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
ok Tim next step now is to remove the

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.090 
ok Tim next step now is to remove the
products<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:10.050> give<00:02:10.229> it<00:02:10.259> a<00:02:10.350> good<00:02:10.440> wolf<00:02:10.679> off<00:02:10.830> and

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100

products and give it a good wolf off and
then<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.660> basically<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:13.080> chemicals<00:02:13.560> will

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
then the basically the chemicals will

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.010 
then the basically the chemicals will
react<00:02:14.190> and<00:02:14.460> bond<00:02:14.670> together<00:02:14.850> and<00:02:15.300> it's<00:02:15.420> all<00:02:15.540> dr.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
react and bond together and it's all dr.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:25.440 
react and bond together and it's all dr.
well<00:02:16.820> remove<00:02:17.820> this<00:02:18.200> carefully

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.839 

we're<00:02:26.050> just<00:02:26.290> about<00:02:26.440> done<00:02:26.590> with<00:02:27.069> the<00:02:27.459> McLaren

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
we're just about done with the McLaren

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:29.369 
we're just about done with the McLaren
and<00:02:27.940> alls<00:02:28.180> been<00:02:28.390> doing<00:02:28.690> the<00:02:28.780> Bentley<00:02:29.110> as<00:02:29.200> well

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:29.379 
and alls been doing the Bentley as well

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:31.350 
and alls been doing the Bentley as well
but<00:02:29.980> one<00:02:30.129> of<00:02:30.220> the<00:02:30.310> reasons<00:02:30.610> why<00:02:30.730> we<00:02:30.879> do<00:02:30.970> this<00:02:31.090> is

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
but one of the reasons why we do this is

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.850 
but one of the reasons why we do this is
for<00:02:31.599> the<00:02:31.660> filming<00:02:32.019> of<00:02:32.110> course<00:02:32.379> so<00:02:32.620> that<00:02:32.650> when<00:02:32.830> I

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
for the filming of course so that when I

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.890 
for the filming of course so that when I
filming<00:02:33.220> out<00:02:33.340> we<00:02:33.849> minimize<00:02:34.239> the<00:02:34.390> obstructions

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
filming out we minimize the obstructions

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.020 
filming out we minimize the obstructions
from<00:02:35.050> the<00:02:35.140> windscreen<00:02:35.500> wipers<00:02:36.160> and<00:02:36.790> then<00:02:36.970> I

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
from the windscreen wipers and then I

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.309 
from the windscreen wipers and then I
think<00:02:37.180> in<00:02:37.239> the<00:02:37.330> winners<00:02:37.540> just<00:02:37.569> say<00:02:37.900> completely

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
think in the winners just say completely

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.320 
think in the winners just say completely
clear<00:02:38.530> which<00:02:38.739> is<00:02:38.890> obviously<00:02:39.190> better<00:02:39.430> for<00:02:40.209> the

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
clear which is obviously better for the

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.759 
clear which is obviously better for the
videos<00:02:40.690> we're<00:02:40.900> going<00:02:41.019> to<00:02:41.140> be<00:02:41.260> shooting<00:02:41.440> and

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
videos we're going to be shooting and

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:43.380 
videos we're going to be shooting and

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
you can hear the liberty walk 458 there

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.210 
you can hear the liberty walk 458 there
at<00:02:43.540> the<00:02:43.630> other<00:02:43.720> end<00:02:43.900> of<00:02:43.989> the<00:02:44.050> grid<00:02:44.200> roaming<00:02:45.069> up
