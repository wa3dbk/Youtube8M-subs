fasion<00:02:38.440> purification<00:02:39.280> do<00:02:40.090> a<00:02:40.120> couple<00:02:40.569> shots<00:02:41.310> in

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
fasion purification do a couple shots in

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.050 
fasion purification do a couple shots in
there<00:02:42.489> and<00:02:43.620> when<00:02:44.620> they<00:02:44.739> turn<00:02:45.010> in<00:02:45.250> like<00:02:45.400> 15

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
seconds I think it is 15 seconds not as

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.430 
seconds I think it is 15 seconds not as
