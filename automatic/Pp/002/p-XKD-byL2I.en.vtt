00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:09.590
 hello all welcome as they prevented 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.260
 in social networks here is our 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.030
 Summer makeup remember that 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.830
 put many makeup backgrounds 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.650
 natural that treat this that is right now 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:21.530
 then also you do not do it because 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.480
 it's part number 10 in part 2 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.880
 where are we going to convert this makeup 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.920
 that we have today in makeup 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.600
 at night of all organs but good 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.009
 let's do so they tell me what 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.260
 it seems to them 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.820
 well I have my skin ready now 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.489
 I'm going to tell you that abbas use 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.010
 corrector and I already have the outline too 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.430
 we are going to make our eyes and for that we are going 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:48.030
 to start with this color that is called 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:51.149
 satin this we will not apply it in 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.730
 all that for me and I'm going to do it with 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.860
 a brush to blur as it is 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.630
 The first thing we do is apply it in 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.660
 our shade with our brush 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:02.010
 blur all over the eyelid in a way 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.229
 uniform to the basin and what 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.240
 we blend well when doing it with a 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.790
 brush how is the color will be 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.850
 much softer and it will stay more 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.710
 natural we can when we blur it 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.770
 do it a little bit on the outside 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.570
 of the eye to lengthen it now let's 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.240
 apply this tanned powder that has 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.640
 a little bit of brightness but in the part of the 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.130
 basin and with the same brush that 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.469
 we were using 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.689
 in this way when we do it they go 

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:32.520
 to melt all the tones and it's going to create 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.560
 that camouflaged effect 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.810
 let's apply our illuminator as 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.399
 with a slightly more golden hue in 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.799
 the part of the brow bone to 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.780
 eliminate and we do it with this kind of 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.780
 brush to make it much softer 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:49.590
 we are also going to light up the part 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:52.280
 of the lacrimal with the same brush and 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.280
 same tone 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.670
 we blur it well so that they melt 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:59.130
 all colors 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.170
 now we put a little bit of this 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.689
 pigment but we 're going to do it 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.670
 moistening our brush with a little 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.500
 of fix plus so that it is a bit more 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.200
 metallic 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.690
 and we're going to do it around the edge he cited 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.760
 of our the cream I do not in all the 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.069
 part of the eye, but see that it is only 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.680
 bit 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:21.499
 in this way will create that effect more 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.019
 camouflaged and you will see much more 

00:02:21.499 --> 00:02:25.819
 intense in the lacrimal part and leaves 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.999
 blurring outward with the most 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:27.999
 Clear 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.130
 I'm going to make up no eyebrows with this 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.770
 sigma pencil that is super cool 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.870
 because the color is very natural and what 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.520
 I fill in only the spaces that 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.770
 we need to remember that I plot 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.140
 natural eyebrow better we will see the 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:50.819
 look and apply a little gel 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:53.040
 so that the chest is fixed 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.170
 now he will not put the same powder 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.719
 tan we use in the part of 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.909
 up but we're going to do it in the part 

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:02.159
 from below our everything like a eyeliner 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:04.590
 and with this pencil type brush for 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:06.389
 blur it well look that with the tone 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.430
 bronze that has powder is going to 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:10.200
 illuminate the look is not necessary 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.230
 apply pencil because with this is 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.230
 enough 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:18.170

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:24.499
 move to the part of the face to 

00:03:22.249 --> 00:03:26.900

00:03:24.499 --> 00:03:29.750

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.540
