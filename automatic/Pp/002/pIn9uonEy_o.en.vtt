00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:07.350
 live tv audience we have mass here 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.380
 god right next to me 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.730
 he has been here lately 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.590
 prepared for the season in pittsburgh 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.139
 how was every training so now 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.090
 I'm always happy with the white wings 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.300
 if I know here we train 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.820
 may with the guys here I can do that 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.650
 my fashion sascha together on master 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.930
 always fun and afterwards on the 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.939
 guys have good now saisonstart the 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.590
 Preparation here is not quite optimal 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.840
 would you say what you are hanging on 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.730
 now finally played with here 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.540
 in the training only carefully watched how 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.540
 the boys are on it 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:45.149
 I did not see it later but 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.730
 Often the preparation clear and 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.649
 to a little bit I think that 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.140
 subtleties of tuning 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.420
 and that's just to implement good 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.850
 then I think yes they are your 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.469
 can achieve goals if you want 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.809
 now the training here compared to the r 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:05.090
 dl and then comparatively with the 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.090
 energy there are still the differences 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:10.260
 now biggest difference because of that 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.330
 the smaller ice over there than anything 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.560
 longer and thus is more physical 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.390
 or a lot more physical and 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.600
 manager clear that the top stars the 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.150
 Of course, we are very good at it 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.170
 is it the trio martin everybody knows 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.579
 but there are many where on the go 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.200
 were and then someday decision 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.900
 you have to meet if you still have that 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.270
 wants to join in and wait for the chance 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.570
 or if you were his future then that 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.610
 for example, in europe, and looking for it 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.549
 has many good players technically 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.040
 strong and that does not always carry itself 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:51.049
 that has my jumping power as well is that 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.049
 live as nhl-profi really now 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.680
 So I play quite often and me 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.409
 which will be the time shifts and so on 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.060
 know so far strict but well me 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.490
 next time to play in the league 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.520
 and well, I will do my best 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.810
 that he is off good season and look 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.220
 how far can you get this 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.020
 In Pittsburgh you would say you are 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:17.280
 really happy with life in there 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.630
 the usa and as a hockey professional yes so has 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.130
 it with the laser is so prof 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.569
 In any case, I have everyone in front of me 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.180

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.010

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.780

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.550

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.519
 How did she feel? 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:35.160

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.760
