hey<00:00:16.279> YouTube<00:00:16.670> here<00:00:16.939> I<00:00:16.970> have<00:00:17.270> this<00:00:17.920> 2013<00:00:18.920> Subaru

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490 
hey YouTube here I have this 2013 Subaru

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.170 
hey YouTube here I have this 2013 Subaru
Impreza<00:00:20.300> WRX<00:00:20.480> STI<00:00:21.349> and<00:00:22.160> this<00:00:22.730> one<00:00:22.880> just<00:00:23.090> so

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180 
Impreza WRX STI and this one just so

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.970 
Impreza WRX STI and this one just so
happens<00:00:23.539> to<00:00:23.599> be<00:00:23.720> unmarked<00:00:24.140> so<00:00:24.349> I<00:00:24.380> figured<00:00:24.800> it

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
happens to be unmarked so I figured it

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.800 
happens to be unmarked so I figured it
would<00:00:25.220> be<00:00:25.340> a<00:00:25.369> perfect<00:00:25.880> opportunity<00:00:25.970> to<00:00:26.480> go

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
would be a perfect opportunity to go

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.200 
would be a perfect opportunity to go
