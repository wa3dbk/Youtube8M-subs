comcast network also we have heard a lot
about<00:00:18.119> radon<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:19.080> second<00:00:19.500> leading<00:00:19.680> cause<00:00:19.830> of

lung cancer behind smoking we usually

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.890 
lung cancer behind smoking we usually
think<00:00:23.010> about<00:00:23.310> it<00:00:23.609> in<00:00:23.760> our<00:00:23.850> basements<00:00:24.510> but<00:00:24.660> now

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
think about it in our basements but now

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.200 
think about it in our basements but now
some<00:00:25.590> reports<00:00:25.980> state<00:00:26.220> that<00:00:26.250> radon<00:00:26.760> is<00:00:27.029> in

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
some reports state that radon is in

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.540 
some reports state that radon is in
granite<00:00:27.750> if<00:00:27.960> you<00:00:28.410> have<00:00:28.619> granite<00:00:28.949> in<00:00:29.189> your<00:00:29.340> home

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
granite if you have granite in your home

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.370 
granite if you have granite in your home
you<00:00:30.029> may<00:00:30.240> want<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:30.570> consider<00:00:30.840> getting<00:00:31.170> it

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
you may want to consider getting it

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.400 
you may want to consider getting it
tested<00:00:31.830> for<00:00:32.070> radon<00:00:32.340> gas<00:00:32.759> in<00:00:33.180> fact<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:34.020> EPA

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
tested for radon gas in fact the EPA

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.500 
tested for radon gas in fact the EPA
says<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.950> only<00:00:35.160> way<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.579> really<00:00:35.790> know<00:00:35.910> is

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
says the only way to really know is

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.869 
says the only way to really know is
through<00:00:37.050> testing<00:00:37.559> because<00:00:38.070> you<00:00:38.309> can't<00:00:38.579> see

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
through testing because you can't see

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.910 
through testing because you can't see
right<00:00:39.120> on<00:00:39.329> you<00:00:39.510> can't<00:00:39.719> smell<00:00:39.989> it<00:00:40.050> you<00:00:40.500> cannot

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
right on you can't smell it you cannot

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.010 
right on you can't smell it you cannot
taste<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.489> now<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:42.059> issue<00:00:42.390> has<00:00:42.629> been<00:00:42.750> raised

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
taste it now the issue has been raised

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.650 
taste it now the issue has been raised
periodically<00:00:43.980> really<00:00:44.969> over<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.239> last<00:00:45.270> 10

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660

you know I'm concerned we're hearing

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.730 
you know I'm concerned we're hearing
that<00:01:09.180> some<00:01:09.479> health<00:01:09.750> physicists<00:01:10.590> and

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
that some health physicists and

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.620 
that some health physicists and
radiation<00:01:11.490> experts<00:01:11.970> agree<00:01:12.270> that<00:01:12.420> most

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
radiation experts agree that most

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.770 
radiation experts agree that most
granite<00:01:13.560> countertops<00:01:14.159> emit<00:01:14.700> some<00:01:15.270> radiation

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
granite countertops emit some radiation

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.380 
granite countertops emit some radiation
and<00:01:16.110> some<00:01:16.380> radon<00:01:17.189> so<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.640> question<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.210> you

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
and some radon so the question to you

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.670 
and some radon so the question to you
doctor<00:01:18.930> is<00:01:19.110> do<00:01:19.590> we<00:01:19.830> need<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.220> be<00:01:20.369> concerned

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
doctor is do we need to be concerned

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.649 
doctor is do we need to be concerned
absolutely<00:01:22.939> you<00:01:23.939> had<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.180> be<00:01:24.270> concerned

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
absolutely you had to be concerned

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.380 
absolutely you had to be concerned
because<00:01:24.979> these<00:01:25.979> countertops<00:01:26.520> are<00:01:27.000> these

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
because these countertops are these

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.149 
because these countertops are these
granite<00:01:28.380> is<00:01:28.710> coming<00:01:29.130> from<00:01:29.250> Brazil<00:01:29.729> how<00:01:31.159> does

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
granite is coming from Brazil how does

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.819 
granite is coming from Brazil how does
image<00:01:32.610> extremely<00:01:33.509> high<00:01:33.720> concentration<00:01:34.619> of

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
image extremely high concentration of

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.020 
image extremely high concentration of
radon<00:01:35.729> all<00:01:36.000> radioactive<00:01:36.740> gas<00:01:37.759> which<00:01:38.759> can

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
radon all radioactive gas which can

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.149 
radon all radioactive gas which can
cause<00:01:39.299> lung<00:01:39.630> cancer<00:01:39.890> alright<00:01:40.890> so<00:01:41.009> you're

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
cause lung cancer alright so you're

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.480 
cause lung cancer alright so you're
saying<00:01:41.430> just<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.909> granite<00:01:42.360> from<00:01:42.570> Brazil

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
saying just the granite from Brazil

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.210 
saying just the granite from Brazil
basically<00:01:44.490> we<00:01:44.909> have<00:01:44.939> been<00:01:46.189> noticing<00:01:47.189> that

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
basically we have been noticing that

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.810 
basically we have been noticing that
most<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.119> green-eyed<00:01:49.220> emits<00:01:50.220> radiation

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
most of the green-eyed emits radiation

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.749 
most of the green-eyed emits radiation
it<00:01:51.659> depends<00:01:52.170> on<00:01:52.229> which<00:01:52.500> brian<00:01:52.920> i<00:01:53.040> do<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.430> have

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
it depends on which brian i do you have

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.109 
it depends on which brian i do you have
in<00:01:54.119> your<00:01:54.509> house<00:01:54.780> if<00:01:55.590> suppose<00:01:56.219> if<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.700> take<00:01:56.939> in

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
in your house if suppose if you take in

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.929 
in your house if suppose if you take in
certain<00:01:57.659> granite<00:01:58.079> every<00:01:58.829> granite<00:01:59.280> emits

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
certain granite every granite emits

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.319 
certain granite every granite emits
certain<00:02:00.719> radiation<00:02:01.130> it<00:02:02.130> depends<00:02:02.610> on<00:02:02.700> how<00:02:02.939> high

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
certain radiation it depends on how high

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.210 
certain radiation it depends on how high
the<00:02:04.259> concentration<00:02:05.159> of<00:02:05.280> uranium<00:02:05.689> radium<00:02:06.689> and

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
the concentration of uranium radium and

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.460 
the concentration of uranium radium and
phosphate<00:02:08.220> you<00:02:08.520> have<00:02:08.789> in<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.209> granite<00:02:09.660> if<00:02:09.929> you

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
phosphate you have in the granite if you

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.350 
phosphate you have in the granite if you
have<00:02:10.649> a<00:02:10.679> high<00:02:10.950> concentration<00:02:11.220> of<00:02:11.790> these<00:02:11.970> three

have a high concentration of these three

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.590 
have a high concentration of these three
elements<00:02:12.510> in<00:02:12.840> your<00:02:12.989> ground

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
elements in your ground

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.870 
elements in your ground
night<00:02:13.720> certainly<00:02:14.650> that<00:02:14.860> grenade<00:02:15.280> will<00:02:15.550> emit

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
night certainly that grenade will emit

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.360 
night certainly that grenade will emit
high<00:02:16.180> concentration<00:02:16.960> of<00:02:17.370> radioactivity

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
high concentration of radioactivity

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.520 
high concentration of radioactivity
alright<00:02:18.970> so<00:02:19.360> the<00:02:19.450> first<00:02:19.480> thing<00:02:19.780> is<00:02:20.080> I<00:02:20.230> guess<00:02:20.380> we

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
alright so the first thing is I guess we

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:21.810 
alright so the first thing is I guess we
have<00:02:20.650> to<00:02:20.680> get<00:02:20.890> it<00:02:21.010> tested<00:02:21.220> if<00:02:21.550> we're<00:02:21.670> not<00:02:21.760> sure

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
have to get it tested if we're not sure

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.110 
have to get it tested if we're not sure
correct<00:02:23.160> absolutely<00:02:24.160> you<00:02:24.310> must<00:02:24.610> test<00:02:24.880> the

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
correct absolutely you must test the

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.700 
correct absolutely you must test the
radon<00:02:25.990> gas<00:02:26.400> so<00:02:27.690> you<00:02:28.690> should<00:02:28.900> do<00:02:29.050> two<00:02:29.500> ways

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
radon gas so you should do two ways

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.160 
radon gas so you should do two ways
first<00:02:30.190> you<00:02:30.430> should<00:02:30.490> piss<00:02:30.820> your<00:02:31.060> basement<00:02:31.540> that

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
first you should piss your basement that

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.930 
first you should piss your basement that
will<00:02:32.380> tell<00:02:32.620> you<00:02:32.800> the<00:02:32.980> source<00:02:33.280> of<00:02:33.490> radon<00:02:33.820> and

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
will tell you the source of radon and

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.090 
will tell you the source of radon and
entry<00:02:34.210> coming<00:02:34.510> into<00:02:34.750> your<00:02:34.840> home<00:02:35.020> and<00:02:35.320> then<00:02:35.950> you

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
entry coming into your home and then you

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.740 
entry coming into your home and then you
should<00:02:36.280> test<00:02:36.490> the<00:02:36.700> second<00:02:37.120> floor<00:02:37.270> which<00:02:37.570> is<00:02:37.600> a

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
should test the second floor which is a

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.930 
should test the second floor which is a
kitchen<00:02:38.200> that<00:02:38.410> will<00:02:39.160> tell<00:02:39.370> you<00:02:39.490> how<00:02:39.520> much<00:02:39.820> of

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
kitchen that will tell you how much of

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.630

radon gas is coming it or emitting from
your<00:02:43.060> kitchen<00:02:43.780> or<00:02:43.990> you<00:02:44.950> can<00:02:45.130> say<00:02:45.310> from<00:02:45.520> granite

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
your kitchen or you can say from granite

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.870 
your kitchen or you can say from granite
are<00:02:46.120> there<00:02:46.420> safe<00:02:46.780> levels<00:02:47.320> of<00:02:47.620> radon<00:02:48.430> in

are there safe levels of radon in

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.940 
are there safe levels of radon in
granite<00:02:49.420> or<00:02:49.630> is<00:02:49.840> it<00:02:49.960> all<00:02:50.110> hazardous<00:02:50.710> to<00:02:50.920> our
