00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.020
 They collect some surfboard with a surfboard 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.540
 Experience with the waves and after a few exercises on the beach and in quiet 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.540
 fairway 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:15.179
 but 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.619
 If you're a good swimmer, try your hand at Paris 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.060
 It helps them to develop a feeling for waves shows them as they do 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.499
 choose to vote and is good for fitness 

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:30.869
 Put yourself in deep water until the wave is almost with you 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.869
 they jump with their arms over their heads in front of the wave 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.210
 Tighten your body and lead it before the wave 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.660
 with some exercise they can change the direction and at the waves wall 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.180
 glide along 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.310
 look for Velen near the beach and start to collide with sources 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.310
 not in big breakers 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.720
 paddling is the basic technique for bread control 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.200
 make paddling in shallow water 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.880
 they get used to holding the balloons in the wooden boards on the board and 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.880
 stress all the muscles you need later in the waves 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.530
 For the first time you lie on the bed you need the optimal board 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.280
 Find location that is the position in which they are close 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.850
 and the brettener sticks out of the water about a hand's breadth 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.960
 Make as long and strong paddle moves as possible on the side of the board 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.950
 along which the hand, slightly curved, punctures far forward 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.180
 slow deep trains are more effective than fast flat ones 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.280
 The feet make contact between them and their surfboard 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.500
 they are responsible for steering acceleration and braking 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.110
 gain control of the board by shifting your weight to four 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.500
 different points 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.500
 Forsa and those feet 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.820
 the back foot and the associated leg are used around the board 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:01.569
 rotate 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:02.800
 and to slow down 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.870
 while accelerating and steering with the front foot 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.229
 her foot position decides if she wants a mat chord 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.569
 or a buffet 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.569
 If the left foot is in front they are a match 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:20.280
 instinctively put your right foot forward, they are a buffet 

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:25.989
 on a right breaking wave, a match watch drives forehand 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.039
 So with a view to the wave 

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:30.969
 a goofy he drives on the same wave backhand 

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:33.969
 he has the wave in his back 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:42.150
 the right foot position allows for optimal board control 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.640
 As far as pace and direction are concerned, it only allows the mental image 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.039
 a maneuver to implement ineffective movements 

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:53.489
 In the water, this position changes constantly when the body moves 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.099
 As the beginner should try a certain balance of the board 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:00.099
 Internalize basic position on the board 

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:07.049
 her feet are parallel shoulder wide apart the knees are light 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:08.219
 bent 

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:11.219
 the hands show shoulder height in the direction of travel 

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:19.209
 the back arm is angled and is located in front of the chin 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.039
 front office is stretched out at chest height in extension of the shoulders 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:31.560
 her lower body is stable over the wide middle her upper body is loose 

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:34.559
 and flexible 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:40.889
 Now that you know the right standing position, it's time to get up 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:42.649
 give 

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:46.110
 Place your hands on the edges of the board at chest height 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.479
 the thorax of the slightly raised 

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:53.169
 wave one leg and place your foot next to the other's knee 

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:54.089
 car 

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:58.389
 The foot is fasting the position in which even when standing on the board will be 

00:03:59.899 --> 00:04:03.199
 They press their arms and feet in a fluid motion 

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:07.129
 up and bring the new forefoot in with your knees in the chest 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:09.769
 a position vertically under her head 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:14.090
 The back foot stays in place now but with the entire sole of the foot 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.090
 standing on the board 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:20.859
 straighten yourself up 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.929
 The knees are slightly bent while her torso is almost upright 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.160
 They can make this movement wherever they have enough space 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.990
 have to lie down 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.979
 Hereafter they practice the better 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:38.289
 To get a better feel for the board, practice them on the beach 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:42.840
 pile up they looked up at a hill and put the board on it 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.540
 stick to your board and watch how he behaves when 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.309
 they give weight to the stern 

00:04:48.309 --> 00:04:52.879
 how the nose held and what happens when they turn the board back and forth 

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:56.149
 These are important techniques when you board through the white water of the 

00:04:56.149 --> 00:04:59.149
 maneuver the waves all the time 

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:04.059
 stand on the board to get a feel for what is going on 

00:05:04.059 --> 00:05:07.059
 Shift of body jewelry point what happens 

00:05:08.059 --> 00:05:11.169
 Put your weight back and lift your nose 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:14.729
 so the board is braked in a wave 

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:19.889
 shift your weight forward and press down on the nose 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:22.889
 Wave wins the board so drive 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:27.139
 Pay attention to the most calm and fluid movements 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:33.009
 When they have gained confidence on land it's time to get into it 

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:35.120
 To go for water 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.759
 Seek a place as something remote from others 

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:41.849
 push the board flat on the water next to you 

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:44.080
 while they wait outside 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.310
 If a wave comes down, push down the stern of the board 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.529
 so that the nose lifts over the shaft 

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:52.529
 Then you let go of your nose and go on 

00:05:57.529 --> 00:06:00.529
 keep the money always perpendicular to the waves 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.009
 wait in deepest water on a wave 

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:16.300
 the Brettener is pointing to the shore just before it reaches the wave jump 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:20.419
 They put on the board in the parade position they make strong faster arm pulls 

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:23.710
 and try to get up and concentrate on the 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:28.029
 Foot position keep your body focus IV and balanced 

00:06:29.089 --> 00:06:31.509
 her feet are shoulder wide apart 

00:06:31.509 --> 00:06:33.439
 knees slightly bent 

00:06:33.439 --> 00:06:36.439
 the hands are pointing in the direction of travel 

00:06:38.999 --> 00:06:40.710
 Be patient 

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:44.300
 To catch broken white water waves and to reliably stand up to it 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.129
 It will take a while 

00:06:46.129 --> 00:06:48.310
 the more time you spend with the guy 

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:51.029
 the faster they progress 

00:06:51.029 --> 00:06:54.029
 guide her 

00:06:55.479 --> 00:06:57.889
 Swans in the waves Paulis threw 

00:06:57.889 --> 00:07:00.949
 in addition to fitness and creates a feeling for the others 

00:07:00.949 --> 00:07:02.449
 8th 

00:07:02.449 --> 00:07:07.120
 hold your hands lightly while paddling, make them deep for 

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.610
 long time 

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:13.259
 Get up on land as a preparation for getting up in the morning 

00:07:13.259 --> 00:07:15.369
 water 

00:07:15.369 --> 00:07:16.550
 Bonn 

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:18.759
