we actually got to conduct our own

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.969 
we actually got to conduct our own
experiments<00:01:45.660> which<00:01:45.869> was<00:01:46.020> really<00:01:46.170> great<00:01:46.380> we

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
experiments which was really great we

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.680 
experiments which was really great we
talked<00:01:47.160> a<00:01:47.190> lot<00:01:47.399> of<00:01:47.460> his<00:01:47.880> each<00:01:48.119> other<00:01:48.300> we<00:01:48.479> walk

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
talked a lot of his each other we walk

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.410 
talked a lot of his each other we walk
in<00:01:48.990> pairs<00:01:49.289> in<00:01:49.649> groups<00:01:49.920> so<00:01:50.369> it's<00:01:51.000> great<00:01:51.149> ample

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
in pairs in groups so it's great ample

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.059 
in pairs in groups so it's great ample
opportunity<00:01:52.050> to<00:01:52.170> communicate<00:01:52.470> with<00:01:52.860> each

00:01:53.059 --> 00:01:53.069 
opportunity to communicate with each

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:55.040 
opportunity to communicate with each
other<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.880> so<00:01:54.090> I<00:01:54.119> really<00:01:54.420> like<00:01:54.660> it<00:01:54.690> the
