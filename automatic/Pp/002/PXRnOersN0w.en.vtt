there<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:36.120> crucial<00:00:36.600> part<00:00:36.809> for<00:00:37.020> me<00:00:37.140> is<00:00:37.200> the

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
there the crucial part for me is the

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.040 
there the crucial part for me is the
lines<00:00:37.800> on<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.129> far<00:00:38.340> side<00:00:38.719> doesn't<00:00:39.719> raise<00:00:39.870> his

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
lines on the far side doesn't raise his

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.350 
lines on the far side doesn't raise his
flag<00:00:40.320> so<00:00:40.860> he<00:00:41.070> doesn't<00:00:41.399> think<00:00:41.460> those<00:00:42.000> players

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
flag so he doesn't think those players

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.630 
flag so he doesn't think those players
are<00:00:42.750> interfering<00:00:43.469> with<00:00:43.620> play<00:00:43.920> although

are interfering with play although

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.700 
are interfering with play although

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
they're in an offside position he puts

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.740 
they're in an offside position he puts
his<00:00:46.829> hand<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.100> his<00:00:47.280> ear<00:00:47.430> or<00:00:47.670> there's<00:00:48.510> obviously

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.750 
his hand to his ear or there's obviously
