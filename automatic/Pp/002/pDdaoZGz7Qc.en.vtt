00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
fussy a pizza cutter is helpful when we

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.510 
fussy a pizza cutter is helpful when we
get<00:00:53.460> down<00:00:53.640> into<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.120> slope<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:55.010> we<00:00:56.010> can<00:00:56.219> probe

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
get down into the slope and we can probe

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.279 
get down into the slope and we can probe
and<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:57.239> probe<00:00:57.480> will<00:00:57.629> tell<00:00:57.809> us<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:58.109> certain

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
and the probe will tell us a certain

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.049 
and the probe will tell us a certain
number<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.680> things<00:00:58.890> but<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.879> really

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
number of things but to really

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.720 
number of things but to really
understand<00:01:00.539> what<00:01:00.750> we're<00:01:00.930> feeling<00:01:01.520> with<00:01:02.520> the

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
understand what we're feeling with the

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.429 
understand what we're feeling with the
probe<00:01:02.969> we<00:01:03.180> need<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.480> dig<00:01:03.690> at<00:01:03.840> least<00:01:04.019> one<00:01:04.260> or<00:01:04.409> two

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
probe we need to dig at least one or two

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.160 
probe we need to dig at least one or two
pits<00:01:04.920> so<00:01:05.309> we<00:01:05.489> can<00:01:05.640> answer<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:06.030> question<00:01:06.420> what

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
pits so we can answer the question what

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.050 
pits so we can answer the question what
is<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.590> cause<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:08.070> density<00:01:08.520> layer<00:01:08.790> and

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
is the cause of that density layer and

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.280 
is the cause of that density layer and
how<00:01:09.540> deep<00:01:09.750> do<00:01:09.960> I<00:01:10.020> need<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.350> go<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:11.010> take<00:01:11.189> it<00:01:11.310> out

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.130 

so<00:01:16.290> one<00:01:16.500> of<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.770> options<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:17.310> we<00:01:17.520> have<00:01:18.140> over

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
so one of the options that we have over

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.170 
so one of the options that we have over
and<00:01:19.260> above<00:01:19.410> a<00:01:19.590> simple<00:01:19.950> tile<00:01:20.610> drainage<00:01:20.850> probe

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
and above a simple tile drainage probe

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.550 
and above a simple tile drainage probe
is<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.450> densitometer

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
is a densitometer

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.130 
is a densitometer
this<00:01:23.040> one's<00:01:23.250> built<00:01:23.460> by<00:01:23.670> Dickie<00:01:24.150> John<00:01:24.390> it

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
this one's built by Dickie John it

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.720 
this one's built by Dickie John it
actually<00:01:25.500> gives<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:25.890> reading<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.520> gives

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:26.730 
actually gives you a reading and gives

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.970 
actually gives you a reading and gives
you<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.000> pressure<00:01:27.320> readings<00:01:28.320> on<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.530> scale

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:28.980 
you the pressure readings on a scale

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.250 
you the pressure readings on a scale
that<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:29.400> can<00:01:29.610> see<00:01:29.820> as<00:01:29.970> you<00:01:30.000> apply<00:01:30.390> steady

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:31.260 
that you can see as you apply steady

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.140 
that you can see as you apply steady
even<00:01:31.470> pressure<00:01:31.620> into<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.340> soil<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:32.700> can<00:01:32.940> see

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
even pressure into the soil you can see

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.360 
even pressure into the soil you can see
the<00:01:33.300> needle<00:01:33.450> actually<00:01:33.990> moving<00:01:34.770> up<00:01:35.070> and

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:35.370 
the needle actually moving up and

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.090 
the needle actually moving up and
indicating<00:01:36.180> an<00:01:36.660> increase<00:01:37.050> or<00:01:37.380> decrease<00:01:37.620> in

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
indicating an increase or decrease in

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.790 
indicating an increase or decrease in
density<00:01:38.280> as<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:39.480> can<00:01:39.660> see<00:01:39.870> the<00:01:40.080> needle<00:01:40.680> is

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:40.800

the<00:02:24.840> soil<00:02:25.110> probe<00:02:25.410> we've<00:02:25.680> deduced<00:02:25.890> that<00:02:26.310> there

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
the soil probe we've deduced that there

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.140 
the soil probe we've deduced that there
is<00:02:26.730> a<00:02:27.019> density<00:02:28.019> layer<00:02:28.200> at<00:02:28.470> 9<00:02:29.160> inches<00:02:29.580> and<00:02:29.850> 12

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
is a density layer at 9 inches and 12

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.690 
is a density layer at 9 inches and 12
inches<00:02:30.570> or<00:02:30.750> possibly<00:02:31.290> between<00:02:31.680> them<00:02:31.830> so<00:02:32.340> as<00:02:32.519> we

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
inches or possibly between them so as we

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.490 
inches or possibly between them so as we
ran<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.030> saw<00:02:33.209> probe<00:02:33.450> that<00:02:33.660> would<00:02:33.810> be<00:02:33.930> here<00:02:34.320> and

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
ran the saw probe that would be here and

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.229 
ran the saw probe that would be here and
here<00:02:34.640> and<00:02:35.640> as<00:02:35.970> you<00:02:36.090> can<00:02:36.209> see<00:02:36.269> from<00:02:36.600> the<00:02:36.720> tape

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
here and as you can see from the tape

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.320 
here and as you can see from the tape
that's<00:02:39.239> roughly<00:02:39.900> at<00:02:40.530> 9<00:02:40.860> inches<00:02:41.250> and<00:02:41.459> here<00:02:42.180> at

12 where we ran into density layers what
we<00:02:45.959> did<00:02:46.080> was<00:02:46.260> we<00:02:46.380> quickly<00:02:46.620> dug<00:02:46.980> a<00:02:47.010> pit<00:02:47.280> that's

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
we did was we quickly dug a pit that's

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.030 
we did was we quickly dug a pit that's
very<00:02:47.850> very<00:02:48.060> easy<00:02:48.300> to<00:02:48.480> do<00:02:48.920> shouldn't<00:02:49.920> take<00:02:50.010> very

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
very very easy to do shouldn't take very

very very easy to do shouldn't take very
long<00:02:50.250> with<00:02:50.550> a<00:02:50.580> shovel<00:02:50.850> at<00:02:51.000> all<00:02:51.150> and<00:02:51.530> what<00:02:52.530> we're

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
long with a shovel at all and what we're

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.699 
long with a shovel at all and what we're
checking<00:02:53.010> it<00:02:53.610> for<00:02:53.940> is<00:02:54.239> that<00:02:54.570> what<00:02:55.560> we're

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
checking it for is that what we're

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.440 
checking it for is that what we're
finding<00:02:56.070> with<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:56.459> probe<00:02:56.700> and<00:02:56.940> what<00:02:57.330> we're

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
finding with the probe and what we're

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.860 
finding with the probe and what we're
finding<00:02:57.630> here<00:02:58.110> are<00:02:58.320> matching<00:02:58.860> so<00:02:59.420> the<00:03:00.420> topsoil

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
finding here are matching so the topsoil

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.080 
finding here are matching so the topsoil
in<00:03:01.019> this<00:03:01.140> particular<00:03:01.590> case<00:03:01.799> is<00:03:02.010> 9<00:03:02.549> inches<00:03:02.760> deep

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
in this particular case is 9 inches deep

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.580 
in this particular case is 9 inches deep
and<00:03:03.920> the<00:03:04.920> subsoil<00:03:05.340> of<00:03:05.549> course<00:03:05.730> is<00:03:05.880> below<00:03:06.150> that

and the subsoil of course is below that

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.960 
and the subsoil of course is below that
you'll<00:03:07.590> notice<00:03:07.980> if<00:03:08.160> you<00:03:08.280> look<00:03:08.310> real<00:03:08.670> close<00:03:08.940> you

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
you'll notice if you look real close you

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.720 
you'll notice if you look real close you
can<00:03:09.269> see<00:03:09.510> where<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:09.930> a<00:03:09.959> B<00:03:10.290> horizon<00:03:10.440> was<00:03:11.040> but

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
can see where the a B horizon was but

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.370 
can see where the a B horizon was but
it's<00:03:11.850> been<00:03:12.000> really<00:03:12.330> stirred<00:03:12.660> up<00:03:12.900> in<00:03:13.049> this<00:03:13.140> case

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
it's been really stirred up in this case

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.160 
it's been really stirred up in this case
my<00:03:13.680> guess<00:03:13.920> is<00:03:14.130> that<00:03:14.310> they've<00:03:14.519> ran<00:03:15.049> either<00:03:16.049> a

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
my guess is that they've ran either a

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.740 
my guess is that they've ran either a
mobile<00:03:16.440> really<00:03:17.100> deep<00:03:17.430> or<00:03:17.670> a<00:03:17.970> deep<00:03:18.269> Ripper<00:03:18.630> at

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
mobile really deep or a deep Ripper at

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.300 
mobile really deep or a deep Ripper at
some<00:03:18.989> point<00:03:19.260> in<00:03:19.350> time<00:03:19.530> and<00:03:19.799> I've<00:03:19.950> actually

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
some point in time and I've actually

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.910 
some point in time and I've actually
blended<00:03:20.790> the<00:03:20.910> ad<00:03:21.060> horizon<00:03:21.750> out<00:03:21.900> then<00:03:22.410> possibly

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
blended the ad horizon out then possibly

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.460 
blended the ad horizon out then possibly
have<00:03:23.160> installed<00:03:23.549> the<00:03:23.850> density<00:03:24.660> to<00:03:24.720> there<00:03:24.870> the

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
have installed the density to there the

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.410 
have installed the density to there the
way<00:03:25.650> to<00:03:25.709> check<00:03:26.040> for<00:03:26.190> the<00:03:26.310> density<00:03:26.519> layer

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
way to check for the density layer

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.300 
way to check for the density layer
is<00:03:27.510> either<00:03:27.810> with<00:03:27.990> a<00:03:28.020> knife<00:03:28.260> or<00:03:28.440> the<00:03:29.010> pizza

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
is either with a knife or the pizza

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.589 
is either with a knife or the pizza
cutter<00:03:29.459> we'll<00:03:29.670> use<00:03:29.849> both<00:03:30.090> and<00:03:30.240> show<00:03:30.360> you<00:03:30.420> how

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599 
cutter we'll use both and show you how

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:33.050 
cutter we'll use both and show you how
and<00:03:30.870> you<00:03:31.349> stick<00:03:31.620> the<00:03:31.860> knife<00:03:32.099> into<00:03:32.430> the<00:03:32.610> wall<00:03:32.849> of

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
and you stick the knife into the wall of

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.430 
and you stick the knife into the wall of
the<00:03:33.150> trench<00:03:33.420> which<00:03:33.660> you've<00:03:33.810> made<00:03:34.020> nice<00:03:34.260> and

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
the trench which you've made nice and

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.320 
the trench which you've made nice and
smooth<00:03:34.650> by<00:03:34.830> the<00:03:34.890> way<00:03:35.040> you've<00:03:35.190> dug<00:03:35.370> and<00:03:35.580> then

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
smooth by the way you've dug and then

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.300 
smooth by the way you've dug and then
just<00:03:36.540> gently<00:03:36.840> pull<00:03:37.170> up<00:03:37.319> and<00:03:37.500> when<00:03:38.040> it<00:03:38.130> gets

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
just gently pull up and when it gets

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.050 
just gently pull up and when it gets
hard<00:03:38.580> you<00:03:38.849> will<00:03:39.030> feel<00:03:39.209> it<00:03:40.340> so<00:03:41.340> once<00:03:41.550> again<00:03:41.670> like

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
hard you will feel it so once again like

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.150 
hard you will feel it so once again like
the<00:03:42.209> soil<00:03:42.390> probe<00:03:42.720> it's<00:03:43.200> a<00:03:43.380> it's<00:03:43.590> a<00:03:43.680> feel<00:03:43.920> thing

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
the soil probe it's a it's a feel thing

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.550 
the soil probe it's a it's a feel thing
so<00:03:44.760> if<00:03:44.940> we<00:03:45.000> start<00:03:45.420> down<00:03:45.569> here<00:03:45.630> in<00:03:46.050> the<00:03:46.170> subsoil

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
so if we start down here in the subsoil

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.520 
so if we start down here in the subsoil
once<00:03:46.830> again<00:03:47.100> we<00:03:47.760> can<00:03:47.940> pull<00:03:48.120> up<00:03:48.239> and<00:03:48.450> you<00:03:49.380> can

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
once again we can pull up and you can

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.260 
once again we can pull up and you can
feel<00:03:49.739> where<00:03:49.920> it<00:03:49.950> was<00:03:50.100> harder<00:03:50.430> there<00:03:50.610> and<00:03:51.060> there

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
feel where it was harder there and there

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:52.760 
feel where it was harder there and there
it's<00:03:51.600> a<00:03:51.660> little<00:03:51.840> smoother<00:03:52.110> you<00:03:52.410> got<00:03:52.530> a<00:03:52.560> rock

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:52.770 
it's a little smoother you got a rock

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.370 
it's a little smoother you got a rock
there

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
there

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.290 
there
y'all<00:03:55.380> can<00:03:55.500> also<00:03:55.680> use<00:03:55.980> a<00:03:56.010> pizza<00:03:56.760> cutter<00:03:56.940> it's<00:03:57.180> a

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
y'all can also use a pizza cutter it's a

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.729 
y'all can also use a pizza cutter it's a
little<00:03:57.540> bit<00:03:57.630> more<00:03:57.780> sensitive<00:03:58.170> to<00:03:58.440> the<00:03:58.530> touch

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
little bit more sensitive to the touch

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.449 
little bit more sensitive to the touch
and<00:03:59.040> the<00:03:59.700> pizza<00:03:59.970> cutter<00:04:00.120> also<00:04:00.630> allows<00:04:00.900> you<00:04:01.140> to

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
and the pizza cutter also allows you to

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:04.190 
and the pizza cutter also allows you to
scribe<00:04:02.459> where<00:04:02.880> you<00:04:03.060> see<00:04:03.300> the<00:04:03.510> the<00:04:03.780> density

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
scribe where you see the the density

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.100 
scribe where you see the the density
differences<00:04:04.620> so<00:04:05.220> here<00:04:05.459> as<00:04:05.610> we<00:04:05.760> pull<00:04:05.970> up

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 
differences so here as we pull up

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:08.449 
differences so here as we pull up
actually<00:04:07.110> you're<00:04:07.200> better<00:04:07.380> to<00:04:07.470> pull<00:04:08.190> up<00:04:08.310> like

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
actually you're better to pull up like

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.020 
actually you're better to pull up like
this<00:04:09.019> there's<00:04:10.019> a<00:04:10.140> hard<00:04:10.380> spot<00:04:10.650> right<00:04:10.830> there<00:04:11.040> so

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
this there's a hard spot right there so

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.620 
this there's a hard spot right there so
we'll<00:04:12.180> mark<00:04:12.360> it<00:04:12.510> like<00:04:12.720> that<00:04:14.150> and<00:04:15.150> then<00:04:15.330> carry

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
we'll mark it like that and then carry

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.960 
we'll mark it like that and then carry
on<00:04:15.810> up<00:04:15.959> oh<00:04:17.570> there's<00:04:18.570> our<00:04:18.750> friend<00:04:19.019> there<00:04:19.169> and

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
on up oh there's our friend there and

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.469 
on up oh there's our friend there and
then<00:04:20.970> we<00:04:21.120> measure<00:04:22.700> where<00:04:23.700> the<00:04:23.850> spot<00:04:24.120> is<00:04:24.270> so

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
then we measure where the spot is so

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:26.870 
then we measure where the spot is so
here<00:04:24.810> that<00:04:25.590> density<00:04:25.889> the<00:04:26.070> layer<00:04:26.250> was<00:04:26.430> right<00:04:26.729> at

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
here that density the layer was right at

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.700 
here that density the layer was right at
nine<00:04:27.060> inches<00:04:27.330> so<00:04:27.540> what<00:04:27.930> we<00:04:28.080> want<00:04:28.320> to<00:04:28.440> do<00:04:28.530> and

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
nine inches so what we want to do and

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.409 
nine inches so what we want to do and
we're<00:04:28.830> running<00:04:29.100> deep<00:04:29.250> tillage<00:04:29.460> tools<00:04:29.850> is

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 
we're running deep tillage tools is

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:32.450 
we're running deep tillage tools is
obviously<00:04:30.900> run<00:04:31.229> underneath<00:04:31.770> the<00:04:31.890> nine<00:04:32.070> inches

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
obviously run underneath the nine inches

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.460 
obviously run underneath the nine inches
by<00:04:33.030> at<00:04:33.180> least<00:04:33.330> a<00:04:33.510> few<00:04:33.660> inches<00:04:33.720> to<00:04:34.080> be<00:04:34.200> able<00:04:34.289> to

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
by at least a few inches to be able to

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.230 
by at least a few inches to be able to
blow<00:04:34.650> it<00:04:34.770> out<00:04:34.860> so<00:04:35.190> this<00:04:35.520> will<00:04:35.669> tell<00:04:35.820> us<00:04:35.970> where

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
blow it out so this will tell us where

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.550 
blow it out so this will tell us where
to<00:04:36.270> set<00:04:36.539> our<00:04:36.660> deep<00:04:37.169> tillage<00:04:37.350> tools<00:04:39.440> so<00:04:40.440> there

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
to set our deep tillage tools so there

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.500 
to set our deep tillage tools so there
you<00:04:40.680> have<00:04:40.710> it<00:04:40.860> mark<00:04:41.220> with<00:04:41.460> a<00:04:41.490> few<00:04:41.789> simple<00:04:42.210> tools

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
you have it mark with a few simple tools

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:43.909 
you have it mark with a few simple tools
a<00:04:42.750> little<00:04:42.870> bit<00:04:43.050> of<00:04:43.140> time<00:04:43.380> a<00:04:43.410> little<00:04:43.620> bit<00:04:43.770> of

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 
a little bit of time a little bit of

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:46.430 
a little bit of time a little bit of
sweat<00:04:44.160> we've<00:04:44.940> established<00:04:45.210> the<00:04:45.810> exact<00:04:46.140> depth

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
sweat we've established the exact depth

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.800 
sweat we've established the exact depth
that<00:04:46.620> we<00:04:46.740> need<00:04:46.890> to<00:04:47.070> run<00:04:47.250> we<00:04:48.000> can<00:04:48.180> save<00:04:48.390> money<00:04:48.600> on

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
that we need to run we can save money on

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.469 
that we need to run we can save money on
fuel<00:04:49.080> save<00:04:49.680> money<00:04:49.860> on<00:04:49.950> where<00:04:50.220> parts<00:04:50.610> save<00:04:51.240> some

time improve our soil quality by not

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.659 
time improve our soil quality by not
