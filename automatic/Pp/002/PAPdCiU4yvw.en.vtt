hey<00:00:00.480> guys<00:00:00.690> just<00:00:01.469> took<00:00:01.589> apart<00:00:01.829> the<00:00:01.890> wharf<00:00:02.129> tails

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
hey guys just took apart the wharf tails

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.280 
hey guys just took apart the wharf tails
just<00:00:02.730> to<00:00:02.909> see<00:00:03.030> what<00:00:03.149> happens<00:00:03.480> or<00:00:03.899> not<00:00:03.929> what

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
just to see what happens or not what

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.940 
just to see what happens or not what
happens<00:00:04.650> but<00:00:04.859> see<00:00:05.130> what's<00:00:05.310> inside<00:00:05.460> them<00:00:06.000> and

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:06.950 
happens but see what's inside them and

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.230 
happens but see what's inside them and
we<00:00:07.950> have<00:00:08.099> a<00:00:08.179> beautiful<00:00:09.179> 15<00:00:09.750> inch<00:00:09.929> warfare

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:11.240 
we have a beautiful 15 inch warfare

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:18.620 
we have a beautiful 15 inch warfare
quite<00:00:12.240> a<00:00:12.269> nice<00:00:12.509> sized<00:00:12.929> so<00:00:15.560> 200<00:00:16.560> watt<00:00:17.420> and<00:00:18.420> just

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
quite a nice sized so 200 watt and just

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.859 
quite a nice sized so 200 watt and just
turns<00:00:18.840> run<00:00:19.109> I<00:00:20.330> can't<00:00:21.330> say<00:00:21.510> anything<00:00:21.660> on<00:00:21.810> the

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
turns run I can't say anything on the

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:30.470 
turns run I can't say anything on the
back<00:00:22.020> that<00:00:24.410> so<00:00:25.410> here<00:00:25.680> we<00:00:25.740> have<00:00:25.859> it<00:00:28.609> Model<00:00:29.609> D<00:00:29.880> 0<00:00:30.210> 0

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
back that so here we have it Model D 0 0

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:38.569 
back that so here we have it Model D 0 0
for<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.750> wolf<00:00:31.140> tells<00:00:32.690> Cambridge<00:00:33.690> England<00:00:37.579> fits

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
for a wolf tells Cambridge England fits

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.910 
for a wolf tells Cambridge England fits
up<00:00:38.760> what<00:00:39.000> else<00:00:39.149> you<00:00:39.390> want<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:39.989> you've<00:00:40.710> got<00:00:40.829> the

up what else you want and you've got the

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:48.500 
up what else you want and you've got the
insides<00:00:41.280> there<00:00:43.160> obviously<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:45.530> just<00:00:47.510> it's

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
insides there obviously and so just it's

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.160 
insides there obviously and so just it's
a<00:00:48.570> huge<00:00:48.960> so<00:00:49.489> now<00:00:50.489> let<00:00:50.610> me<00:00:50.670> get<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.789> good<00:00:50.940> foot

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
a huge so now let me get a good foot

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.720 
a huge so now let me get a good foot
it's<00:00:52.170> quite<00:00:52.350> heavy<00:00:52.530> as<00:00:52.680> well<00:00:52.829> it's<00:00:53.010> about<00:00:53.070> 2

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
it's quite heavy as well it's about 2

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.650 
it's quite heavy as well it's about 2
kilos<00:00:54.440> as<00:00:55.440> heavy<00:00:55.800> as<00:00:55.949> my<00:00:55.980> 10<00:00:56.309> inch<00:00:56.340> HP<00:00:57.559> and<00:00:59.660> also

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
kilos as heavy as my 10 inch HP and also

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.560 
kilos as heavy as my 10 inch HP and also
we<00:01:00.840> have<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.170> tweeter<00:01:01.500> which<00:01:02.460> if<00:01:02.640> I<00:01:02.879> take<00:01:03.449> this

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
we have a tweeter which if I take this

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.140 
we have a tweeter which if I take this
out<00:01:03.799> is<00:01:04.799> also<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.729> massive<00:01:06.450> tweeter<00:01:07.080> or<00:01:08.150> a

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
out is also a massive tweeter or a

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.840 
out is also a massive tweeter or a
massive<00:01:09.810> home<00:01:10.110> Twitter<00:01:10.619> should<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:10.799> say<00:01:11.070> the

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
massive home Twitter should I say the

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.130 
massive home Twitter should I say the
size<00:01:12.150> that<00:01:12.330> thing's<00:01:12.570> massive

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
size that thing's massive

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.920 
size that thing's massive
it's<00:01:13.260> even<00:01:13.500> got<00:01:13.530> his<00:01:13.680> own<00:01:13.770> heatsink<00:01:14.280> on<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.520> on

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
it's even got his own heatsink on it on

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:25.219 
it's even got his own heatsink on it on
set<00:01:15.930> you<00:01:15.960> down<00:01:21.229> here<00:01:22.229> we<00:01:22.320> have<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:24.229> absolutely

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
set you down here we have it absolutely

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.880 
set you down here we have it absolutely
huge<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:25.740> can<00:01:25.890> see<00:01:26.070> my<00:01:26.220> hand<00:01:26.430> compared<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:27.000> it

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
huge you can see my hand compared to it

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.960 
huge you can see my hand compared to it
and<00:01:29.270> yeah<00:01:30.270> its<00:01:30.420> massive<00:01:31.610> it's<00:01:32.610> very<00:01:32.820> good

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
and yeah its massive it's very good

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.399 
and yeah its massive it's very good
quality<00:01:33.329> as<00:01:33.420> well<00:01:35.210> yeah<00:01:36.210> that's<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.540> tweeter

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:46.170 

the<00:01:40.040> thing<00:01:40.310> is<00:01:40.490> it's<00:01:40.820> the<00:01:41.000> Beast<00:01:43.390> all<00:01:44.390> right<00:01:44.540> so

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
the thing is it's the Beast all right so

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:59.560 
the thing is it's the Beast all right so
there's<00:01:47.180> the<00:01:47.420> inside<00:01:47.750> is<00:01:48.290> all<00:01:48.530> circuitry

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.250 

those<00:02:00.170> are<00:02:00.350> all<00:02:00.470> resistors<00:02:01.340> I<00:02:02.080> think<00:02:03.080> there's

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260 
those are all resistors I think there's

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.520 
those are all resistors I think there's
white<00:02:03.470> things<00:02:03.680> of<00:02:03.830> resistors<00:02:04.310> anyway<00:02:05.530> since

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
white things of resistors anyway since

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.570 
white things of resistors anyway since
it<00:02:06.710> says<00:02:07.250> everything<00:02:07.910> on<00:02:08.030> it<00:02:08.149> 25<00:02:08.630> watt<00:02:09.280> 1<00:02:10.280> ohm

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.800 

25<00:02:13.580> watt<00:02:14.290> it's<00:02:15.290> just<00:02:15.560> everything<00:02:16.190> on<00:02:16.340> there<00:02:16.810> I

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
25 watt it's just everything on there I

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.150 
25 watt it's just everything on there I
think<00:02:18.650> that's<00:02:18.770> it

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
think that's it

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.040 
think that's it
in<00:02:20.030> doctor<00:02:21.820> to<00:02:22.820> keep<00:02:23.090> I<00:02:23.420> don't<00:02:23.450> know<00:02:23.690> it's

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
in doctor to keep I don't know it's

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.870 
in doctor to keep I don't know it's
probably<00:02:24.230> an<00:02:24.440> inductor<00:02:24.860> some<00:02:25.070> thoughts<00:02:25.730> on

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
probably an inductor some thoughts on

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.480 
probably an inductor some thoughts on
our<00:02:26.030> average<00:02:26.480> stir<00:02:26.840> yeah<00:02:27.680> I<00:02:27.710> think<00:02:27.890> I<00:02:28.100> just<00:02:28.130> not

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
our average stir yeah I think I just not

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:36.190 
our average stir yeah I think I just not
mess<00:02:28.670> around<00:02:28.820> with<00:02:29.060> that<00:02:29.210> so<00:02:29.480> right<00:02:35.050> this<00:02:36.050> is

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
mess around with that so right this is

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.900 
mess around with that so right this is
the<00:02:36.290> 15<00:02:36.680> obviously<00:02:37.160> I'll<00:02:37.280> just<00:02:37.430> showed<00:02:37.610> you<00:02:37.790> it

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
the 15 obviously I'll just showed you it

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:47.830 
the 15 obviously I'll just showed you it
it's<00:02:38.570> great<00:02:38.900> sub<00:02:46.000> so<00:02:47.000> the<00:02:47.120> next<00:02:47.270> video<00:02:47.420> I'll<00:02:47.810> be

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
it's great sub so the next video I'll be

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.870 
it's great sub so the next video I'll be
showing<00:02:48.110> you<00:02:48.290> the<00:02:48.440> soap<00:02:49.010> while<00:02:49.520> it's<00:02:49.670> being

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
showing you the soap while it's being

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:56.920 
showing you the soap while it's being
powered<00:02:51.880> from<00:02:52.880> this<00:02:53.840> obviously<00:02:54.709> so<00:02:55.489> yeah<00:02:55.930> stay

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
powered from this obviously so yeah stay
