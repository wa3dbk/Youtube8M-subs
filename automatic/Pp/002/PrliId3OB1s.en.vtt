00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.940
 boxes is one of the assistants of daniel 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.190
 I wonder what kind of rewards 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.420

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.839
 time to snoop 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.620
 to see which room I will enter first 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.780
 where I'll have left that change of clothes 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.120
 I think it's in the laundry I think 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.739
 It was the air, neither you nor I saw anything. 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.320
 it's time to move on to the next one 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.810
 This room seems to be the fourth 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.220
 daniel there seems to be nobody here 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.220
 it seems to call my attention 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.410
 it looks like a simple computer the 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.420
 I will turn on to see what this has 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:21.140

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.900

 one of his friends had to help me 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.859

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.989
