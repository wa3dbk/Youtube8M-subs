good

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:05:02.460 

you<00:04:52.690> may<00:04:52.840> suppose<00:04:52.990> Laurel

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.100 

and<00:05:02.680> guys<00:05:03.400> the<00:05:03.610> trick<00:05:03.850> is<00:05:04.030> when<00:05:04.840> you<00:05:04.930> read

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
and guys the trick is when you read

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:06.780 
and guys the trick is when you read
because<00:05:05.530> you<00:05:05.680> want<00:05:05.860> to<00:05:05.890> have<00:05:06.070> the<00:05:06.310> interior

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:06.790 
because you want to have the interior

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:10.140 
because you want to have the interior
internal<00:05:07.510> temperature<00:05:08.110> of<00:05:08.320> the<00:05:08.650> food<00:05:09.150> 165

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
internal temperature of the food 165

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.030 
internal temperature of the food 165
degrees<00:05:10.360> for<00:05:10.690> at<00:05:10.750> least<00:05:10.840> 15<00:05:11.230> seconds<00:05:11.680> that

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:12.040 
degrees for at least 15 seconds that

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.650 
degrees for at least 15 seconds that
kills<00:05:12.280> off<00:05:12.460> all<00:05:12.670> the<00:05:12.850> bacteria<00:05:12.970> the<00:05:13.480> boob

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:13.660 
kills off all the bacteria the boob

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.430 
kills off all the bacteria the boob
organism<00:05:14.290> so<00:05:14.950> I<00:05:15.480> see<00:05:16.480> it<00:05:16.570> up<00:05:16.750> to<00:05:16.870> a<00:05:16.930> simmer<00:05:16.960> of

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
organism so I see it up to a simmer of

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.870 
organism so I see it up to a simmer of
oil<00:05:17.650> I<00:05:17.860> want<00:05:18.190> to<00:05:18.250> make<00:05:18.370> sure<00:05:18.400> there's<00:05:18.730> at<00:05:18.850> least

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 
oil I want to make sure there's at least

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.660 
oil I want to make sure there's at least
15<00:05:19.420> minutes<00:05:19.660> to<00:05:20.020> be<00:05:20.140> 15<00:05:20.470> seconds<00:05:20.920> of<00:05:21.040> a<00:05:21.160> similar

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:21.670 
15 minutes to be 15 seconds of a similar

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:23.850 
15 minutes to be 15 seconds of a similar
oil<00:05:22.090> before<00:05:22.690> I<00:05:22.870> service<00:05:23.200> so<00:05:23.530> all<00:05:23.710> that
