00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:51.789 
spectrum there we go and do white and I

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:59.669 
spectrum there we go and do white and I
clip<00:01:52.030> back<00:01:52.209> their<00:01:52.479> angle<00:01:56.789> and<00:01:58.349> with<00:01:59.349> that's

00:01:59.669 --> 00:01:59.679 
clip back their angle and with that's

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:05.490 
clip back their angle and with that's
that<00:02:00.399> simple<00:02:00.970> of<00:02:01.179> a<00:02:01.420> thing<00:02:02.379> I<00:02:02.709> can<00:02:02.920> add<00:02:03.989> text<00:02:04.989> to

that<00:02:10.300> simple<00:02:10.810> and<00:02:11.020> now<00:02:11.290> it<00:02:11.500> has<00:02:11.709> a<00:02:12.069> way<00:02:12.970> to

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
that simple and now it has a way to

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.350 
that simple and now it has a way to
