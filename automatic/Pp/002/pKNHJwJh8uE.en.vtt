00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:08.340
 I chose Palermo mainly for 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.900
 two reasons the first because it has me 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.360
 convinced the project it is a 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.340
 really interesting project is great 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.920
 for me and I 'm really happy to have it 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.539
 married the second project is why 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.119
 despite the many offers on issues 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.380
 arrived from germany from england 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:26.490
 I wanted to try the experience in 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.990
 I have no problem with the Italian championship a 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.869
 I've already played three in the past 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.369
 in my other teams and in the national team 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.670
 in the defense of three I can play a lot 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.230
 in the middle as much as the third on the left 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.239
 defense case that is a good role 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.160
 we started talking about yesterday and 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.629
 this morning with the mister and I'm looking for 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.190
 to begin to understand his first 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:49.440
 indications so I think that the 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.840
 Italian league is great for a 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.390
 defender because here is a lot 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.789
 be careful you work so much on tactics ed 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.190
 it is normal that tactics especially 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.050
 for the defenders it is very important then 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.789
 it's normal to every league every league 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.070
 presents its own difficulties for a 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.570
 new player to adapt despairs of 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.229
 overcome them very soon 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.409
 for this also an experience 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.299
 international and he obviously did 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.509
 wishes to be ready at your disposal 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.369
 for visas regarding 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.500

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.049
 extraordinary game jersey with gods 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.280
 unique colors like only pink and black 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.960

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.310
 international you agree with you 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.740

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.689

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.030

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.770
 world cups 3 open africa is then ho 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.270
 played international matches with 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.130
 their clubs and so much with her chester 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.560

 all this can help me 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.360
 regarding my model like 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.220
 you will understand is liliam thuram that in 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.570
 france played played with the 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.270
 French national team in Italy has played 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.679
 and won both with Juventus and for 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.210
 his lifestyle of the way of playing 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:58.369
 for me it has always been a model for 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.500
 as for the attackers in 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.090
 one I do n't give a precise name also because 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.750
 here I will face players absolutely 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:08.209
 I know I will have to commit to the 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.440
 maximum for which I will really face gods 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.440
 great of great champions
