00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.849
 Hello 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.849
 well today we will talk about weapons 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.769
 olds why change 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:16.590
 I wanted to share with you through 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.510
 this video of the little tricks all 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.880
 simple one had to think about it 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.400
 so certainly I did not invent them 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.550
 certainly exists in the stands but 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.529
 I developed them and that for 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:33.000
 save time especially for 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:38.640
 shoot with this kind of flintlock guns 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.550
 30 minutes 13 balls a blank baj c this is 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.969
 the time needed but it does not take 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.890
 Not less 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.530
 especially if you have trouble in the process of 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.300
 road which happens quite often 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.149
 so I will share with you my 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.190
 first little trick go it's gone 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:58.730
 during loading we go through this 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:02.370
 phase there the laying of the notebook on the barrel 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:05.580
 the pose of the ball in this case of 44 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.189
 we look for the small flat facet 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.740
 kick them out here they are me to the 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:16.799
 up and strongly presses with the 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:19.409
 inch for then depressed laval with the 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.119
 post ball but we can save time 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.710
 for this phase there and I will you 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.900
 show how here is how to win 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:34.170
 time to present the ball and its 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:39.890
 notebook and here are two seconds 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:43.740
 shows you it's over it's putting 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.369
 here it is the closest in it took me 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.220
 two seconds 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.270
 so it's a considerable time gained 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.270
 it only has to sink 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.229
 for the tube design a tube of 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:01.440
 plumbing there were fourteen outside 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:05.490
 20 cm long it can accommodate 14 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:09.539
 bullets and leave a guard for 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:16.440
 guide the ball thumb do not forget to 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:18.000
 the end a frank field why that 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.930
 allows to clear the tube at the moment of 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.580
 thrust without risking 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.540
 the second ball you will understand 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:31.410
 why so to fill the tube nothing 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.480
 more simple we catch the notebook on 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.230
 will oppose it on the ball that was laid 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:40.290
 facets down here lay on the 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:46.550
 ball we feel between them we present the 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:53.250
 tube also concentrates and we press 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:54.720
 here and we make 14 like that I'm 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.190
 am not asked the question of whether 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.560
 it was selling the trade but I am 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.480
 persuaded someone there is thought and icsa 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.239
 must turn in some that time 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.209
 the key is to share 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:08.190
 the idea that it makes you win time 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.760
 precious during your matches that's 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.760
 super, see you soon 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.760
