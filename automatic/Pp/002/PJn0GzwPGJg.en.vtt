00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:11.490
 for all the files or and we have an ecotourism video to cox fifpro the same 

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:15.599
 i am a bit special because i will not be 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.669
 obviously that involved mentioned but with a little bit of the tutorial practicing the 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:20.369
 shed g 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.439
 I do not know lately they have put too much comments 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:24.929
 that exceed 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:26.609
 how to heal and go 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:27.859
 a little more 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:31.029
 I'm going to say defensively so this is not the essence of October 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:31.809
 service 

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:33.210
 but p 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.210
 achieve high scores without residents 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.670
 a hundred and especially because there are many people have said 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.000
 you have to upload the dedicated videos of richter 9 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.860
 and although a lot of people accept that the background is what it offers of the 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.430
 cute exchequer that is 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.090
 program that when one gets to be envious of rossi giuly 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.550
 and hp of helicopters and so on 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.520
 it's easier to make high markers 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.260
 I do not agree with that so good 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.530
 it does not give you number one because 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.990
 even though he wants to be a very good player for constantly fractional character 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.590
 of death of nine out of 11 is expected to be 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.500
 and only because of that one can say that wilkerson was out of the ordinary but the 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.900
 another thing that I do not agree is because this 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.640
 we are worried is the score is very high without it 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.450
 put on how it's called without putting the 15 many 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.010
 this game was only added by defensive tusquets 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.380
 boente expressing it spectacles the encierro detested the medal 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.450
 these carts for god 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.900
 you had property 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.759
 this with the prelate the sector looks and iron of the stake that text but 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:42.439
 this is not enough because this was 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:44.830
 today's first game was this 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.340
 and he was half asleep he lives in the morning and in 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.420
 I'm not going to try the cake of the class I put him were close but I put him in 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.990
 secondary laia is because I love 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.800
 per cent possession of the sealant because the appearance is one of the few in biskek 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.050
 It is equally strong with and without silencer 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.270
 and there the only thing I do not like very much is in the iron mine but 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.150
 says master and approve 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.269
 for gonzález and necid 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:10.319
 out there present 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.090
 good part of getting them out 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.179
 as an example that the contributory 40 

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:17.109
 against Spain and abroad 

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:21.180
 the idea is to constantly enhance general is innocent in its 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.389
 union 

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:25.259
 obviously they do not know where I am and it's the most important 

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:26.759
 the excellent audience 

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:28.400
 i also for a hundred 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.099
 same and in the bone marrow 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:35.170
 was the promoter of zentropa camping thus this hoarding way only 

00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:38.169
 can win perfectly faith forum talk here is something that I think that 

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:41.299
 that the tc understand well 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:42.680
 pécresse said ecclestone 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.680
 min 70 al 

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:54.739
 when these two taiwan reproductions peace and then they facilitate you 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.479
 mcclanahan the death of marten 

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:59.269
 but you are playing ferro 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:04.359
 70 dc sun prakken dyn now modified the person to get off 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:05.889
 enemies to follow death 

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:06.790
 the people who do not 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.039
 Total will be a party 

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:13.709
 that that was not normal is informative but that only percent 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.939
 come that there are no assistances by sea of ​​rock peter there are challenges every time 

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:18.299
 that you page 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:19.319
 thus 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:20.250
 I know that you chaves 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.739
 if you're here you can not shoot and kill 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.079
 and if it is not close to May for two reasons 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:29.540
 the number one is because he has nothing, no one can revive him before tests with 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:30.569
 flip flops because may 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:31.659
 that team 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:33.999
 the second reason is why 

00:03:33.999 --> 00:03:37.649
 per hundred sialle more fall as here that let him voted sialle rather and what 

00:03:37.649 --> 00:03:41.019
 matehuala deaths of this matter is not worth risking to kill me with 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:41.779
 pistols 

00:03:41.779 --> 00:03:44.929
 the third time although very important because you left the baits of 

00:03:44.929 --> 00:03:47.479
 know exactly where that guy was that that guy 

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:48.879
 dying dying 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:52.170
 I doubt that I can simply do the repeated roofing 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:56.010
 If you listen to or see on the map, you have lit up a little red 

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.990
 because there he did not shoot 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:59.879
 you know exactly where the enemy is located 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:03.390
 then I even think that the last death that I do here the bag comments 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:04.289
 yes 

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:07.999
 and obviously the enemy when he spends his bullets killing the guy who leads in favor 

00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:08.869
 of the treasury 

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:11.179
 'nole' that both parties to nani 

00:04:11.179 --> 00:04:13.209
 and this efe 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:16.749
 percent supposed is talking about the goats that are in 

00:04:16.749 --> 00:04:20.809
 a lot of people underestimate the fact that these guys texel navy the spy against spy 

00:04:20.809 --> 00:04:22.620
 of the 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.069
 the touch and the reason is because if the artists 

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:29.330
 tenacious and that you know in your mixed map the enemies and you will not go looking for them 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.930
 this is what one has to be the next good 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.120
 with the plane with three piñera is one of the best that you feel my 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.949
 opinion because this is to send anything the sky and they do not 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:38.449
 they are going to see 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:42.490
 a helicopter a boat that napalm and so on if they have a bardem 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:43.960
 blocked that is the 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.699
 the breath before from 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:47.949
 unique in northern Lima 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:49.150
 the leaders 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.400
 in that guy a and b from canada and he knew that the other guy 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.830
 was going to get to kill him and the state 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.199
 the sport is presided over by my possible karma you have against the 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:04:58.720
 blackpool 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.210
 maybe there is no other way to 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.210
 vilalta that is more than what I am behind the enemies 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.919
 the date went through our combination of these two 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:07.770
 because 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.120
 once you are suing 2 of kiosqueros together 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.210
 you giving them to the emmy awards the andalusian 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:18.069
 all these acts of protest but obviously not with the current one because it is the 

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:20.180
 what we have to do is take out the enemies 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.430
 recognizes being with someone is already 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.240
 I will look exactly for the red dots 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.110
 predict 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.740
 from where they shoot against costa rica oscar arias 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.219
 from where he shot whether he's dying he lost 

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:33.719
 and in this the last death 

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:37.999
 he left it there cleaned and sando and discounted by kevin kern the triangular 

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:40.999
 rose is attacking 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.120
 percent is and friends reported that it is to beat this game of 10 points 0 

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:49.639
 percent I said nothing more sergio xix defensive nothing offensive magical but 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:51.150
 nobody sends 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:55.219
 and it's proof that you can win without saying kiss kiss high 

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:56.889
 many of these people god
