00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.270
 military this week is a 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.500
 international looters contest so 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.240
 person recovery akazu in France where 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.119
 fourteen nations actually come 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.820
 train and perfect their 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.910
 procedure to recover staff 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:39.480
 who would have been isolated 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:40.680
 lost on the battlefield for 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.170
 save life rico that's what we 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.809
 previously called the sis so has the 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.149
 fight search and rescue this concept 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.829
 it's a bit more developed now 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.600
 that is, we will not recover 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.190
 only staff who were 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.500
 equipped equipped as before 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.969
 the typical case was a pilot who 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.309
 ejects into enemy territory 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.500
 currently the if that's rather the 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.359
 staff who are trained and equipped 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.589
 now we are also recovering from 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:12.960
 staff who are untrained and 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:16.670
 equipped theory we can save it but 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.670
 He insists 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.560
 the typical course of a mission 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:23.140
 also so here is the flight part it's 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.329
 the pilots receive as at any 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.460
 exercise a weather briefing the space 

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:29.320
 aerial that is used and receive 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.079
 also an intel situation so 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.329
 intelligence on what's going on in the 

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:35.979
 theater and receive finally have their 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:37.390
 mission so that is to say here we are 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.329
 have so many people who have 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.829
 found isolated at this or that place 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.329
 so the pilots go next 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:44.319
 pilots and force extractions of which 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:45.670
 you're going infantry are going to go 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:46.350
 prepare the mission for about 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.549
 three hours 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.349
 then they have an hour where they will go 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:51.939
 put all together and briefer the 

00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:54.189
 mission so is recapitulated all this 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:56.380
 they prepared during these three 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:58.119
 hours and in an hour they go 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:02.429
 prepare their machine and will run 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.429
 the mission they prepared
