00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.930
 attention in the cevo motor 2014 is the 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.520

 of subaru we can appreciate that the line 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:52.699
 of the car has had a variation in the 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.189
 which model was used a bit but 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:58.159
 does not lose the aggressiveness we can see 

00:00:54.189 --> 00:01:00.979

 baffles later with the four 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:10.009
