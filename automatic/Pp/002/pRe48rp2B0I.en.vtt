can put the roots to that bottom in that

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:03.399 
can put the roots to that bottom in that
space<00:01:59.560> tomatoes<00:02:00.560> have<00:02:00.590> an<00:02:01.190> interesting<00:02:02.409> stem

those little hairs will start to create

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.350 
those little hairs will start to create
part<00:02:14.959> of<00:02:15.050> its<00:02:15.230> root<00:02:15.470> system<00:02:15.500> so<00:02:16.220> I<00:02:16.550> am<00:02:17.180> actually

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
part of its root system so I am actually

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.500 
part of its root system so I am actually
going<00:02:17.720> to<00:02:17.810> bury<00:02:18.170> most<00:02:18.950> of<00:02:19.160> this<00:02:19.370> part<00:02:20.239> of<00:02:20.420> the

plant into the ground and that will just

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.810 
plant into the ground and that will just
give<00:02:25.730> it<00:02:25.970> a<00:02:26.090> stronger<00:02:26.660> root<00:02:26.989> system<00:02:27.440> I'm<00:02:28.220> gonna

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
so that the water can get onto the

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.990 
so that the water can get onto the
leaves<00:02:54.530> and<00:02:54.739> then<00:02:54.860> cause<00:02:55.070> different<00:02:55.700> diseases

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
leaves and then cause different diseases

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.020 
leaves and then cause different diseases
in<00:02:56.299> the<00:02:56.420> plant<00:02:56.660> so<00:02:56.989> I'm<00:02:57.980> just<00:02:58.220> gonna<00:02:58.340> prune<00:02:58.790> off

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
in the plant so I'm just gonna prune off

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.990 
in the plant so I'm just gonna prune off
the<00:02:59.720> ones<00:02:59.900> that<00:03:00.079> I<00:03:00.110> know<00:03:00.549> are<00:03:01.549> gonna<00:03:01.760> be

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
the ones that I know are gonna be

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.060 
the ones that I know are gonna be
underground<00:03:02.420> so<00:03:02.810> I<00:03:02.840> just<00:03:03.230> have<00:03:03.440> the<00:03:03.590> stem<00:03:03.860> I

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
underground so I just have the stem I

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:05.319 
underground so I just have the stem I
don't<00:03:04.220> want<00:03:04.340> any<00:03:04.519> of<00:03:04.640> the<00:03:04.730> leaves<00:03:04.910> under<00:03:05.209> the

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:05.329 
don't want any of the leaves under the

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:09.270 
don't want any of the leaves under the
ground<00:03:05.480> by<00:03:05.930> touching<00:03:06.170> the<00:03:06.380> soil<00:03:06.560> around<00:03:06.799> it<00:03:07.720> so

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
ground by touching the soil around it so

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.180 
ground by touching the soil around it so
good<00:03:10.280> practice<00:03:10.700> when<00:03:10.910> you're<00:03:11.030> taking<00:03:11.450> a<00:03:12.290> plant

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
good practice when you're taking a plant

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.449 
good practice when you're taking a plant
out<00:03:13.640> of<00:03:13.700> its<00:03:14.150> orange<00:03:14.810> starter<00:03:15.230> pot<00:03:15.470> -<00:03:16.130> I

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
out of its orange starter pot - I

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.120 
out of its orange starter pot - I
squeezed<00:03:16.970> it<00:03:17.000> on<00:03:17.420> both<00:03:17.900> sides<00:03:18.230> to<00:03:18.530> loosen<00:03:18.920> it<00:03:19.010> a

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
squeezed it on both sides to loosen it a

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.990 
squeezed it on both sides to loosen it a
little<00:03:19.310> bit<00:03:19.519> and<00:03:19.930> then<00:03:20.930> turn<00:03:21.470> it<00:03:21.680> and

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
little bit and then turn it and

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.509 
little bit and then turn it and
letting<00:03:23.599> the<00:03:23.750> stem<00:03:24.019> rest<00:03:24.319> you<00:03:25.069> don't<00:03:25.250> want<00:03:25.430> to

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
letting the stem rest you don't want to

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:28.630 
letting the stem rest you don't want to
grab<00:03:25.670> the<00:03:25.970> stem<00:03:26.209> too<00:03:26.420> much<00:03:26.599> with<00:03:26.870> your<00:03:27.370> fingers

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
grab the stem too much with your fingers

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.610 
grab the stem too much with your fingers
since<00:03:29.120> the<00:03:29.299> stem<00:03:29.569> is<00:03:29.750> how<00:03:29.900> it<00:03:30.079> brings<00:03:30.349> its

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
since the stem is how it brings its

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.080 
since the stem is how it brings its
water<00:03:30.860> and<00:03:30.980> nutrients<00:03:31.519> to<00:03:31.579> the<00:03:31.670> rest<00:03:31.909> of<00:03:31.970> the

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
water and nutrients to the rest of the

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.420 
water and nutrients to the rest of the
plant<00:03:32.360> so<00:03:32.599> I<00:03:32.629> don't<00:03:32.840> want<00:03:32.959> to<00:03:33.049> damage<00:03:33.230> that<00:03:33.590> so

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
plant so I don't want to damage that so

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.030 
plant so I don't want to damage that so
I'm<00:03:35.030> just<00:03:35.090> kind<00:03:35.390> of<00:03:35.450> resting<00:03:35.840> it<00:03:36.019> on<00:03:36.230> my<00:03:36.769> hand

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
I'm just kind of resting it on my hand

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.289 
I'm just kind of resting it on my hand
that<00:03:37.159> way<00:03:38.799> and<00:03:39.799> squeezing<00:03:40.610> this<00:03:40.730> plant<00:03:41.030> off

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
that way and squeezing this plant off

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:47.020 
that way and squeezing this plant off
with<00:03:41.989> a<00:03:42.110> pot<00:03:42.500> off<00:03:44.890> and<00:03:45.890> it's<00:03:46.040> also<00:03:46.430> this<00:03:46.819> isn't

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
with a pot off and it's also this isn't

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.960 
with a pot off and it's also this isn't
really<00:03:47.329> root<00:03:47.629> bound<00:03:47.780> or<00:03:48.400> compact<00:03:49.400> in<00:03:49.579> there<00:03:49.730> so

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
really root bound or compact in there so

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.830 
really root bound or compact in there so
I<00:03:50.359> don't<00:03:51.140> really<00:03:51.440> need<00:03:51.590> you<00:03:51.829> too<00:03:52.040> much<00:03:52.220> but

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
I don't really need you too much but

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.170 
I don't really need you too much but
good<00:03:53.840> general<00:03:54.200> practice<00:03:54.650> to<00:03:54.890> just<00:03:55.730> break<00:03:56.000> up

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
good general practice to just break up

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.309 
good general practice to just break up
that<00:03:56.209> a<00:03:56.390> little<00:03:56.750> bit<00:03:58.390> I'm<00:03:59.390> going<00:03:59.629> to<00:03:59.750> lay<00:03:59.959> the

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
that a little bit I'm going to lay the

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:03.009 
that a little bit I'm going to lay the
tomato<00:04:01.190> plant<00:04:01.609> into<00:04:01.970> the<00:04:02.209> trench<00:04:02.599> that<00:04:02.870> way

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
tomato plant into the trench that way

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:08.349 
tomato plant into the trench that way
and<00:04:03.709> then<00:04:04.340> very<00:04:04.700> carefully

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:08.359 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:13.990 

bend<00:04:08.780> it<00:04:08.989> up<00:04:09.139> just<00:04:09.650> carefully<00:04:11.049> but<00:04:12.879> I'm<00:04:13.879> gonna

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
bend it up just carefully but I'm gonna

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.229 
bend it up just carefully but I'm gonna
take<00:04:14.269> these<00:04:14.450> sets<00:04:14.810> of<00:04:14.959> leaves<00:04:15.200> off<00:04:16.090> and<00:04:17.090> then

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
take these sets of leaves off and then

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:24.860 
take these sets of leaves off and then
I'm<00:04:17.359> going<00:04:17.510> to<00:04:17.600> start<00:04:17.900> back<00:04:18.590> filling

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.770 

and<00:04:25.410> I<00:04:25.470> always<00:04:25.680> add<00:04:25.830> a<00:04:25.860> little<00:04:26.130> bit<00:04:26.310> of<00:04:26.340> extra

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
and I always add a little bit of extra

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.330 
and I always add a little bit of extra
dirt<00:04:27.780> around<00:04:28.199> back<00:04:28.500> here<00:04:28.770> to<00:04:28.949> give<00:04:29.130> it<00:04:29.250> a

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
dirt around back here to give it a

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.200 
dirt around back here to give it a
little<00:04:29.460> bit<00:04:29.669> of<00:04:29.820> support<00:04:32.030> filling<00:04:33.030> in<00:04:33.120> the

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
little bit of support filling in the

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:34.870 
little bit of support filling in the
hole<00:04:33.389> and<00:04:33.600> pressing<00:04:33.990> down<00:04:34.080> just<00:04:34.380> a<00:04:34.440> little<00:04:34.680> bit

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
hole and pressing down just a little bit

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:44.400 
hole and pressing down just a little bit
so<00:04:35.880> that<00:04:35.910> it's<00:04:37.340> set<00:04:38.340> in<00:04:38.460> there<00:04:38.669> real<00:04:38.940> good

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.600 

as<00:04:45.410> you<00:04:45.530> can<00:04:45.650> see<00:04:45.860> once<00:04:46.070> you<00:04:46.190> get<00:04:46.310> it<00:04:46.400> planted

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
as you can see once you get it planted

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.960 
as you can see once you get it planted
in<00:04:46.940> there<00:04:47.710> it's<00:04:48.710> a<00:04:48.830> lot<00:04:49.009> smaller<00:04:49.370> than<00:04:49.669> it<00:04:49.729> did

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
in there it's a lot smaller than it did

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:50.820 
in there it's a lot smaller than it did
before

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
before

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.140 
before
but<00:04:51.830> I<00:04:51.979> just<00:04:52.220> gave<00:04:52.400> it<00:04:52.550> through<00:04:52.669> its<00:04:52.789> system<00:04:53.120> a

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
but I just gave it through its system a

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.070 
but I just gave it through its system a
little<00:04:53.240> boost<00:04:53.620> and<00:04:54.910> it's<00:04:55.910> standing<00:04:56.840> upright

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
little boost and it's standing upright

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.350 
little boost and it's standing upright
pretty<00:04:57.440> well

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.270 

if<00:05:02.810> you<00:05:02.900> need<00:05:03.110> to<00:05:03.319> you<00:05:03.530> can<00:05:03.650> have<00:05:03.830> a<00:05:03.889> look<00:05:04.069> like

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
if you need to you can have a look like

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.610 
if you need to you can have a look like
I<00:05:04.340> said<00:05:04.490> a<00:05:04.669> little<00:05:04.909> bit<00:05:05.210> of<00:05:05.569> extra<00:05:06.050> dirt<00:05:06.289> around

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
I said a little bit of extra dirt around

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.409 
I said a little bit of extra dirt around
this<00:05:06.770> side<00:05:07.039> if<00:05:07.220> it<00:05:07.370> feels<00:05:07.639> like<00:05:07.819> it's<00:05:08.090> leaning

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:08.419 
this side if it feels like it's leaning

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:11.110 
this side if it feels like it's leaning
over<00:05:09.310> but<00:05:10.310> that's<00:05:10.490> the<00:05:10.610> thing<00:05:10.759> like<00:05:10.940> it's

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
over but that's the thing like it's

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.149 
over but that's the thing like it's
standing<00:05:11.419> up<00:05:11.539> on<00:05:11.720> its<00:05:11.780> own<00:05:12.139> so<00:05:12.590> I'm<00:05:12.710> gonna<00:05:12.860> mark

00:05:13.149 --> 00:05:13.159 
standing up on its own so I'm gonna mark

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:21.390 
standing up on its own so I'm gonna mark
it<00:05:16.930> give<00:05:17.930> it<00:05:18.020> a<00:05:18.110> nice<00:05:18.259> deep<00:05:18.620> watering<00:05:19.039> and

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
it give it a nice deep watering and
