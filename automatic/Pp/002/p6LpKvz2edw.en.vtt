00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 all welcome in this video we are with you 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.400
 We know what to do if it does not turn on 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.269
 computer 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.620
 or rather, consider the reasons why he 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.500
 may not be included 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.139
 here we see such photos 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:20.670
 and first of all what you need to do 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:25.380
 check whether this is well connected 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:29.369
 cable is possible for this power supply 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.619
 he and you have not inserted to the end further from 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.829
 this wire see the other end 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.700
 is it well plugged into the outlet itself 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:43.649
 maybe he is badly connected there 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:47.489
 so the second point here is often the principle 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:50.250
 on all power supplies here in the record of 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.300
 dark block it is allowed here on 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.820
 water photos 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.149
 power supply there is no such buttons 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.020
 turn on turn off often on others 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:03.329
 there is such a button on turn off 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:06.210
 here you need to check you have a block 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.450
 food on zero or on diary if 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:13.439
 zero is it you need to turn on given if you 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:16.850
 it's all done turn on the computers and 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:20.100
 you do not turn it on then most likely 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:25.110
 most likely you burned this one here 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:27.869
 power unit from it go here such here 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.950
 the wires which it feeds the mother 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:34.229
 hard drive drive board and to 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.159
 to check whether it comes from electricity 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:40.619
 let's say there is such a thing 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:44.220
 plastic here you can take 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.890
 connect to it an ordinary fan 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.920
 fan that goes exactly for here 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.899
 such computers they can connectors 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.920
 check that is so you 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:58.140
 can check go go doke here 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.799
 do yo not here power supply current by 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.009
 wires 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.960
 if it doesn't come, then most likely you 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:06.509
 he burned 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.140
 but on this i finish my video thanks 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.910
 behind him 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.030
 they subscribe to my channel everyone 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.030
 until
