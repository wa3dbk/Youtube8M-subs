with<00:00:06.029> a<00:00:06.060> look<00:00:06.270> at<00:00:06.390> the<00:00:06.509> speed<00:00:06.720> and<00:00:06.870> performance

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
with a look at the speed and performance

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.960

over to my television to shoot these
demos<00:00:59.190> but<00:00:59.969> what<00:01:00.120> I<00:01:00.149> want<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.359> do<00:01:00.480> first<00:01:00.809> is

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
demos but what I want to do first is

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.869 
demos but what I want to do first is
test<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.530> disk<00:01:01.829> speed<00:01:02.129> so<00:01:02.430> first<00:01:02.640> we're<00:01:02.760> gonna

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
test the disk speed so first we're gonna

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.460 
test the disk speed so first we're gonna
do<00:01:03.000> an<00:01:03.120> example<00:01:03.660> we're<00:01:03.780> gonna<00:01:03.840> load<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.229> bunch

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
do an example we're gonna load a bunch

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.380 
do an example we're gonna load a bunch
of<00:01:04.589> apps<00:01:04.769> all<00:01:05.010> at<00:01:05.280> once<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.939> see<00:01:06.119> how<00:01:06.210> it

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
of apps all at once to see how it

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.240 
of apps all at once to see how it
handles<00:01:06.570> this<00:01:06.900> now<00:01:07.350> keeping<00:01:07.740> in<00:01:07.830> mind<00:01:08.040> that

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
handles this now keeping in mind that

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.800 
handles this now keeping in mind that
the<00:01:08.340> Mac<00:01:08.490> Mini<00:01:08.520> has<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:09.000> hard<00:01:09.390> disk<00:01:09.689> drive

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
the Mac Mini has a hard disk drive

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.420 
the Mac Mini has a hard disk drive
running<00:01:10.439> at<00:01:10.680> 5400<00:01:11.549> rpm<00:01:12.000> s<00:01:12.119> not<00:01:12.299> 7200<00:01:13.260> but<00:01:13.650> 5400

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
running at 5400 rpm s not 7200 but 5400

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.520 
running at 5400 rpm s not 7200 but 5400
so<00:01:14.549> that's<00:01:14.790> really<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.509> mobile<00:01:16.020> hard<00:01:16.290> disk

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
so that's really a mobile hard disk

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.649 
so that's really a mobile hard disk
drive<00:01:16.770> so<00:01:17.130> it's<00:01:17.280> pretty<00:01:17.490> slow<00:01:17.909> now<00:01:18.330> couple

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
drive so it's pretty slow now couple

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.330 
drive so it's pretty slow now couple
that<00:01:18.810> with<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:18.990> fact<00:01:19.229> that<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.560> only<00:01:19.710> has<00:01:20.009> 2

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
that with the fact that it only has 2

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.609 
that with the fact that it only has 2
gigs<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.820> standard<00:01:21.210> Ram<00:01:21.450> loading<00:01:22.320> all<00:01:22.470> these

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
gigs of standard Ram loading all these

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.380 
gigs of standard Ram loading all these
amps<00:01:22.920> all<00:01:23.100> at<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.310> same<00:01:23.490> time<00:01:23.549> really<00:01:24.090> chokes

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
amps all at the same time really chokes

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.179 
amps all at the same time really chokes
the<00:01:24.540> system<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.470> can<00:01:25.650> see<00:01:25.890> here<00:01:26.159> that

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
the system so you can see here that

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.800 
the system so you can see here that
these<00:01:26.549> things<00:01:26.880> are<00:01:27.060> really<00:01:27.210> loading<00:01:27.600> very

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
these things are really loading very

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.149 
these things are really loading very
slowly<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.380> really<00:01:28.619> don't<00:01:28.770> want<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:28.950> toss

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
slowly you really don't want to toss

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.740 
slowly you really don't want to toss
this<00:01:29.310> much<00:01:29.610> at<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.210> Mac<00:01:30.360> Mini

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
this much at the Mac Mini

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.020 
this much at the Mac Mini
now<00:01:31.020> if<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:31.229> have<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.409> SSD<00:01:32.189> inside<00:01:32.759> this<00:01:32.850> Mac

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
now if you have a SSD inside this Mac

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.940 
now if you have a SSD inside this Mac
many<00:01:33.240> things<00:01:33.509> would<00:01:33.659> go<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:33.869> lot<00:01:34.259> more<00:01:34.439> smoothly

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
many things would go a lot more smoothly

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.069 
many things would go a lot more smoothly
but<00:01:35.430> unfortunately<00:01:35.909> getting<00:01:36.090> an<00:01:36.329> SSD<00:01:36.750> in<00:01:36.990> the

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
but unfortunately getting an SSD in the

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.480 
but unfortunately getting an SSD in the
Mac<00:01:37.229> Mini<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:37.590> very<00:01:37.890> expensive<00:01:38.369> but<00:01:38.430> they

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
Mac Mini is very expensive but they

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.510 
Mac Mini is very expensive but they
actually<00:01:38.759> cost<00:01:38.970> about<00:01:39.240> $600<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.439> upgrade<00:01:40.890> now

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
running our disk speed test we can see

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.539 
running our disk speed test we can see
that<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.680> write<00:01:43.920> speed<00:01:44.159> on<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.369> Mac<00:01:44.520> Mini

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
that the write speed on the Mac Mini

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.420 
that the write speed on the Mac Mini
runs<00:01:45.090> about<00:01:45.360> 70<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.530> read<00:01:46.680> runs<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.220> little

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
runs about 70 and the read runs a little

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.370 
runs about 70 and the read runs a little
under<00:01:47.579> 80<00:01:47.909> Meg's<00:01:48.240> but<00:01:48.810> if<00:01:48.899> we<00:01:48.960> look<00:01:49.170> at<00:01:49.290> the

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
under 80 Meg's but if we look at the

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.649 
under 80 Meg's but if we look at the
MacBook<00:01:49.829> Air<00:01:50.009> with<00:01:50.280> an<00:01:50.460> SSD<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:51.210> runs<00:01:51.540> a

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
little under 270 on the read so there's

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.840 
little under 270 on the read so there's
a<00:01:55.500> huge<00:01:55.770> difference<00:01:56.040> there<00:01:56.340> in<00:01:56.460> terms<00:01:56.670> of

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
a huge difference there in terms of

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.490 
a huge difference there in terms of
overall<00:01:57.149> performance<00:01:57.270> so<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:58.259> explains

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
overall performance so that explains

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.889 
overall performance so that explains

what on the Mac Book Air loads adds

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.990 
what on the Mac Book Air loads adds

install like the new Mac Mini but the

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.120 
install like the new Mac Mini but the
other<00:02:46.140> thing<00:02:46.320> to<00:02:46.440> consider<00:02:46.530> here<00:02:46.920> is<00:02:47.010> the

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
other thing to consider here is the

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.160 
other thing to consider here is the
MacBook<00:02:47.670> Pro<00:02:47.940> is<00:02:48.150> mobile<00:02:48.600> therefore<00:02:49.080> the

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
MacBook Pro is mobile therefore the

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.229 
MacBook Pro is mobile therefore the

of course is desktop computer many of
those<00:02:55.290> mobile<00:02:55.680> considerations<00:02:56.340> and

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
those mobile considerations and

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.280 
those mobile considerations and
limitations<00:02:57.030> aren't<00:02:57.510> an<00:02:57.600> issue<00:02:57.780> here<00:02:58.019> so<00:02:58.050> they

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
limitations aren't an issue here so they

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.199 
limitations aren't an issue here so they
can<00:02:58.440> tune<00:02:58.620> it<00:02:58.739> better<00:02:58.890> for<00:02:59.100> performance<00:02:59.700> now

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
can tune it better for performance now

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.059 
can tune it better for performance now
just<00:03:00.480> take<00:03:00.569> a<00:03:00.600> look<00:03:00.780> briefly<00:03:01.080> at<00:03:01.319> the<00:03:01.560> geekman

down<00:04:47.400> so<00:04:47.819> it's<00:04:47.969> not<00:04:48.090> a<00:04:48.330> great<00:04:48.810> great<00:04:49.469> computer

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
down so it's not a great great computer

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.200 
down so it's not a great great computer
for<00:04:49.889> gaming<00:04:50.069> I<00:04:50.340> wouldn't<00:04:50.580> recommend<00:04:50.819> it<00:04:51.090> but

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
for gaming I wouldn't recommend it but

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.550 
for gaming I wouldn't recommend it but
you<00:04:51.330> certainly<00:04:51.479> can't<00:04:51.779> get<00:04:51.870> it<00:04:51.990> done<00:04:52.169> and<00:04:52.409> like

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
you certainly can't get it done and like

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.350 
you certainly can't get it done and like
I<00:04:52.740> said<00:04:52.800> on<00:04:53.219> the<00:04:53.340> MacBook<00:04:53.520> Air<00:04:53.789> I<00:04:53.969> consider

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
I said on the MacBook Air I consider

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.209 
I said on the MacBook Air I consider
this<00:04:54.449> to<00:04:54.629> be<00:04:54.659> a<00:04:54.749> side<00:04:55.199> benefit<00:04:55.800> and<00:04:55.949> I<00:04:56.009> wouldn't

00:04:56.209 --> 00:04:56.219 
this to be a side benefit and I wouldn't

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:58.219 
this to be a side benefit and I wouldn't
buy<00:04:56.460> the<00:04:57.029> Mac<00:04:57.210> Mini<00:04:57.240> for<00:04:57.569> this<00:04:57.659> purpose<00:04:58.080> but

00:04:58.219 --> 00:04:58.229 
buy the Mac Mini for this purpose but

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:00.830 
buy the Mac Mini for this purpose but
it's<00:04:58.379> nice<00:04:58.499> to<00:04:58.529> have<00:04:58.800> when<00:04:59.310> you<00:04:59.490> want<00:04:59.699> it<00:04:59.849> so<00:05:00.719> in

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
it's nice to have when you want it so in

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:01.999 
it's nice to have when you want it so in
conclusion<00:05:00.990> looks<00:05:01.469> like<00:05:01.590> the<00:05:01.740> Mac<00:05:01.979> Mini

00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:02.009 
conclusion looks like the Mac Mini

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:04.580 
conclusion looks like the Mac Mini
performs<00:05:02.699> very<00:05:02.969> similarly<00:05:03.449> to<00:05:03.599> the<00:05:03.840> standard

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
performs very similarly to the standard

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.860 
performs very similarly to the standard
configuration<00:05:04.770> of<00:05:05.340> the<00:05:05.460> 13-inch<00:05:06.029> MacBook<00:05:06.360> Pro

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
configuration of the 13-inch MacBook Pro

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.439 
configuration of the 13-inch MacBook Pro
which<00:05:07.439> is<00:05:07.469> almost<00:05:08.009> twice<00:05:08.370> as<00:05:08.759> expensive<00:05:08.939> as

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:09.449 
which is almost twice as expensive as

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:10.999 
which is almost twice as expensive as
the<00:05:09.629> Mac<00:05:09.779> Mini<00:05:09.810> so<00:05:10.139> I<00:05:10.169> think<00:05:10.289> this<00:05:10.500> is<00:05:10.560> a<00:05:10.710> pretty

00:05:10.999 --> 00:05:11.009 
the Mac Mini so I think this is a pretty

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:12.320 
the Mac Mini so I think this is a pretty
good<00:05:11.250> value<00:05:11.580> the<00:05:11.699> only<00:05:11.909> thing<00:05:12.060> I<00:05:12.150> would

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
good value the only thing I would

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.629 
good value the only thing I would
recommend<00:05:12.930> is<00:05:13.110> upgrading<00:05:13.919> the<00:05:14.069> RAM<00:05:14.099> from<00:05:14.430> 2

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 
recommend is upgrading the RAM from 2

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:16.369 
recommend is upgrading the RAM from 2
gigs<00:05:14.909> to<00:05:15.060> at<00:05:15.180> least<00:05:15.330> 4<00:05:15.509> gigs<00:05:15.779> but<00:05:16.169> do<00:05:16.349> that

00:05:16.369 --> 00:05:16.379 
gigs to at least 4 gigs but do that

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:17.929 
gigs to at least 4 gigs but do that
yourself<00:05:16.860> you<00:05:16.979> can<00:05:17.099> do<00:05:17.189> it<00:05:17.279> much<00:05:17.400> more<00:05:17.610> cheaply

00:05:17.929 --> 00:05:17.939 
yourself you can do it much more cheaply

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:19.429 
yourself you can do it much more cheaply
than<00:05:18.060> Apple<00:05:18.509> in<00:05:18.569> fact<00:05:18.750> I<00:05:18.900> will<00:05:19.050> have<00:05:19.199> a<00:05:19.229> video

00:05:19.429 --> 00:05:19.439 
than Apple in fact I will have a video

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:21.890 
than Apple in fact I will have a video
on<00:05:19.680> that<00:05:19.860> in<00:05:20.520> my<00:05:20.669> next<00:05:20.729> video<00:05:21.210> or<00:05:21.449> basically

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
on that in my next video or basically

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.540 
on that in my next video or basically
going<00:05:22.020> to<00:05:22.110> upgrade<00:05:22.229> this<00:05:22.500> from<00:05:22.830> 2<00:05:22.979> gigs<00:05:23.219> to<00:05:23.400> 8

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 
going to upgrade this from 2 gigs to 8

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:24.769 
going to upgrade this from 2 gigs to 8
gigs<00:05:23.819> then<00:05:24.210> we're<00:05:24.330> going<00:05:24.449> to<00:05:24.509> test<00:05:24.689> the

00:05:24.769 --> 00:05:24.779 
gigs then we're going to test the

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:26.300 
gigs then we're going to test the
performance<00:05:25.229> to<00:05:25.319> see<00:05:25.469> if<00:05:25.680> we<00:05:25.830> see<00:05:25.979> any<00:05:26.129> big

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
performance to see if we see any big

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.339 
performance to see if we see any big
difference<00:05:26.699> so<00:05:26.879> stay<00:05:27.180> tuned<00:05:27.360> for<00:05:27.509> that<00:05:27.569> so

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:28.349 
difference so stay tuned for that so

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:30.050 
difference so stay tuned for that so
once<00:05:28.499> again<00:05:28.589> guys<00:05:28.860> this<00:05:29.099> is<00:05:29.249> Detroit<00:05:29.550> Borg

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
once again guys this is Detroit Borg
