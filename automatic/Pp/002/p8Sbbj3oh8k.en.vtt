week or so that I've had it I've been
trying<00:02:27.670> out

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
trying out

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.440 
trying out
I<00:02:28.350> changed<00:02:29.350> the<00:02:29.560> blade<00:02:30.190> geometry<00:02:30.490> slightly<00:02:31.390> to

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
I changed the blade geometry slightly to

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.350 
I changed the blade geometry slightly to
start<00:02:31.840> with<00:02:32.080> and<00:02:32.320> I<00:02:33.220> wasn't<00:02:33.430> really<00:02:33.670> sure<00:02:34.000> how

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
start with and I wasn't really sure how

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.990 
start with and I wasn't really sure how
I<00:02:35.050> wanted<00:02:35.560> this<00:02:35.650> because<00:02:36.010> it<00:02:36.130> isn't<00:02:36.250> a<00:02:36.550> cookery

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
I wanted this because it isn't a cookery

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.750 
I wanted this because it isn't a cookery
I<00:02:37.240> thought<00:02:37.780> I'd<00:02:37.900> try<00:02:38.080> with<00:02:38.260> a<00:02:38.380> standard<00:02:39.220> kind

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
I thought I'd try with a standard kind

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.380 
I thought I'd try with a standard kind
of<00:02:39.910> blade<00:02:40.150> geometry<00:02:40.360> but<00:02:40.870> I<00:02:41.220> changed<00:02:42.220> back<00:02:42.610> and

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
of blade geometry but I changed back and

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.950 
of blade geometry but I changed back and
now<00:02:43.720> it's<00:02:43.870> got<00:02:44.020> the<00:02:44.230> kind<00:02:44.830> of<00:02:44.890> Scandinavian

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
now it's got the kind of Scandinavian

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:51.570 
now it's got the kind of Scandinavian
kind<00:02:46.960> of<00:02:47.050> groin<00:02:47.530> to<00:02:47.860> it<00:02:49.710> it<00:02:50.710> cuts<00:02:51.010> very<00:02:51.190> well

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
kind of groin to it it cuts very well

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.530 
kind of groin to it it cuts very well
and<00:02:51.850> I<00:02:52.660> think<00:02:52.900> it's<00:02:53.350> very<00:02:53.710> reminiscent<00:02:54.220> of<00:02:54.550> a

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
and I think it's very reminiscent of a

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.420 
and I think it's very reminiscent of a
rat<00:02:56.200> cutleries<00:02:56.830> rc5<00:02:57.840> it's<00:02:58.840> five<00:02:59.500> inch<00:02:59.710> blade

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
rat cutleries rc5 it's five inch blade

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.840 
rat cutleries rc5 it's five inch blade
and<00:03:00.760> five<00:03:01.750> inch<00:03:01.930> handle<00:03:02.440> ten<00:03:03.130> inches<00:03:03.400> overall

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
and five inch handle ten inches overall

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.300 
and five inch handle ten inches overall
and<00:03:04.120> you've<00:03:04.990> got<00:03:05.200> a<00:03:05.230> six<00:03:05.560> millimeter<00:03:05.980> thick

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
and you've got a six millimeter thick

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.230 
and you've got a six millimeter thick
blade<00:03:06.580> at<00:03:07.360> the<00:03:07.630> the<00:03:08.110> thickest<00:03:08.500> part<00:03:09.000> as<00:03:10.000> you

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:10.240 
blade at the the thickest part as you

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.180 
blade at the the thickest part as you
can<00:03:10.360> see<00:03:10.570> that<00:03:10.840> book<00:03:11.410> might<00:03:11.590> have<00:03:11.740> very<00:03:11.980> very

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
can see that book might have very very

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.060 
can see that book might have very very
good<00:03:12.520> battening<00:03:13.420> so<00:03:14.170> a<00:03:14.200> short<00:03:14.530> battening

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
good battening so a short battening

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.790 
good battening so a short battening
knife<00:03:15.850> it's<00:03:16.720> very<00:03:17.080> very<00:03:17.350> solid

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.220 

it's<00:03:20.800> a<00:03:20.890> lovely<00:03:21.190> looking<00:03:21.490> life<00:03:21.790> the<00:03:22.570> drop

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
it's a lovely looking life the drop

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.340 
it's a lovely looking life the drop
point<00:03:23.550> like<00:03:24.550> I<00:03:24.580> said<00:03:24.820> very<00:03:25.180> similar<00:03:25.630> to<00:03:25.960> me<00:03:26.080> to

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
point like I said very similar to me to

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.670 
point like I said very similar to me to
the<00:03:26.440> the<00:03:26.740> rc5<00:03:27.460> it<00:03:28.090> has<00:03:28.300> that<00:03:28.510> sort<00:03:29.020> of<00:03:29.080> look<00:03:29.410> and

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
the the rc5 it has that sort of look and

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.360 
the the rc5 it has that sort of look and
feel<00:03:30.250> about<00:03:31.090> it<00:03:31.530> but<00:03:32.530> considerably<00:03:33.070> cheaper

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
feel about it but considerably cheaper

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.440 
feel about it but considerably cheaper
this<00:03:33.880> was<00:03:34.240> around<00:03:34.600> about<00:03:34.900> 35<00:03:35.710> to<00:03:36.120> 40<00:03:37.120> dollars

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
this was around about 35 to 40 dollars

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.230 
this was around about 35 to 40 dollars
around<00:03:37.690> that<00:03:37.930> sort<00:03:38.170> of<00:03:38.200> price<00:03:38.550> you<00:03:39.550> can<00:03:39.760> get<00:03:40.030> as

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:40.240 
around that sort of price you can get as

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.150 
around that sort of price you can get as
well<00:03:40.450> for<00:03:41.080> I<00:03:41.110> think<00:03:41.320> it's<00:03:41.590> about<00:03:41.680> five<00:03:41.950> ten

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
well for I think it's about five ten

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.000 
well for I think it's about five ten
dollars<00:03:42.460> more<00:03:42.670> you<00:03:42.760> can<00:03:42.910> get<00:03:43.120> and<00:03:43.360> a<00:03:44.140> horn

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
dollars more you can get and a horn

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.040 
dollars more you can get and a horn
handle<00:03:45.880> rather<00:03:46.330> than<00:03:46.660> the<00:03:46.870> Rosewood<00:03:48.780> that<00:03:49.780> I

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
handle rather than the Rosewood that I

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:51.660 
handle rather than the Rosewood that I
quite<00:03:50.440> like<00:03:50.620> this<00:03:50.800> and<00:03:50.860> it<00:03:51.130> was<00:03:51.280> on<00:03:51.400> on

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
quite like this and it was on on

quite like this and it was on on
discount<00:03:52.090> that's<00:03:52.720> why<00:03:52.900> I<00:03:52.930> ended<00:03:53.140> up<00:03:53.230> with<00:03:53.410> this

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
discount that's why I ended up with this

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.010 
discount that's why I ended up with this

from from the blade there his head

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.800 
from from the blade there his head
turned<00:04:10.270> a<00:04:10.620> little<00:04:11.620> bit<00:04:11.860> sharpening<00:04:12.700> done<00:04:13.570> to
