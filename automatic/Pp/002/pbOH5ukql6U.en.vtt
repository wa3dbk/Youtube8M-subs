00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 hello to all and welcome 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:07.230
 on TV info today we find ourselves 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:10.820
 for the presentation of the netbook 1015b x 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:14.309
 so it's a netbook from asus and 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:17.449
 does not oblige to the normal box of asus 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:23.820
 it's the same box 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:25.410
 usually all like that so so 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.039
 it's a beat and it's like that was missing 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:35.940
 in our sense as friendly 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:38.820
 we find there then the famous netbook 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.500
 so I like it a lot 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.300
 netbook rather pretty like that or done 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.440
 notice to which facts the 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.539
 kids tracks that are good is that 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:58.649
 it does not show too much then it goes 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:01:09.090
 below we find the charger 2 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:12.470
 small notice of small notice so there 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.630
 no user manual and all that 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:20.580
 so now some sort of thing 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:23.310
 matri notice so on pc finally on the 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.140
 foot on the netbook itself so there 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.869
 you see two crips for the 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.869
 okay battery must do like that 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:40.110
 So here is country about 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:43.530
 about that losing 1,200 euros to little 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.909
 close so that's it we team it pretty 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.540
 heavy anyway for netbook it takes 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:55.270
 to confess this is the other or the hotoi 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:57.940
 there are some stuff here so here's the 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.980
 famous netbook so with an integrated 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:04.630
 a webcam 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:06.970
 So here we are there are the famous 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.310
 reference cards there all the little ones 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:13.120
 stickers on the side so we're going 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.200
 find here a fan so at this 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.110
 which is quite rare times on a 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:20.140
 time alicia fan a hdmi plug 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.209
 which is rather practical because 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.860
 he said that the state froze 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.840
 a vga plug 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:31.870
 this is where I think it's taking 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:33.310
 for the charger or I think it's 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:39.070
 taking charge fraud is the prow 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:39.900
 thistle here we find with a small 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.930
 cap 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.620
 wait i think it's a port 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.230
 ethernet 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.150
 ouais is an ethernet a harbor town 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:55.630
 kind of little cap it takes 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:59.580
 qualities of which class and there is for the 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:06.040
 padlock finally here is a rod to 2 usb 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:08.170
 the headphones and a microphone here a jack because 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:13.989
 teese is so here it's a fake map 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:24.400
 sd underneath so of course the battery 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:27.730
 who were there just and the army here a 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:32.860
 kind of worth we have directly 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:35.680
 access to a life which allows you to withdraw 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:38.290
 that and to have access to different 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.630
 components underneath flissi a plug 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.450
 air which is rather not too bad 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.430
 as an auctioneer compared to here so there 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.709
 the famous code for windows 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.570
 so it's a windows 7 starter it's 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:51.299
 like almost every 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.410
 netbooks 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:55.000
 so that's not true anymore than the netbook 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.450
 is quite heavy for an ebook and 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.020
 classics therefore finds the touchpad that is 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:04.630
 rather nice it's not too bad 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:07.360
 him the cliques that's okay 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:14.080
 if I'm not a fan of this kind of barran 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:15.850
 timing otherwise the keyboard is not too bad 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:20.739
 to the ears is this is not bad level 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:22.450
 keyboard a little thing collar so here 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.580
 the keyboard not too bad so the screen is going 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:30.040
 until roughly the law he is a 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:32.130
 hybrid inclination so that's so 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.460
 everything found in this pack 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:38.890
 classical 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:41.680
 the pc pack is really a good 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:44.280
 netbook even if it stays like that remains 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:47.770
 not the best at ASUS 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.870
 so it's for your clique besides the 200 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.040
 euros is not it's not it's 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.230
 not a very excessive form have a 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:56.380
 netbook but she but it's not too much 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:05:02.110
 bad no here I hope I hope that 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:03.910
 accumulated acquire an asus he is 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:07.800
 underneath really like that an asus 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:10.330
 1015b x hd bah it is rather not too bad 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:13.770
 although some performances of his 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:16.870
 desired happened otherwise it's normal 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:19.990
 so that's it so I hope it will have 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.480
 helped those who wanted to acquire this 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.400
 netbook type 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.750
 so that's it so I hope you 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.430
