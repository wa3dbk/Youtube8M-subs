not a wall bang weapon as some of the

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:13.730 
not a wall bang weapon as some of the
weapons<00:02:07.079> like<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:08.450> m4<00:02:09.450> spring<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:11.959> then<00:02:12.959> for

weapons like the m4 spring and then for
i believe<00:02:14.070> is<00:02:14.220> wallbang<00:02:14.730> also<00:02:15.120> but<00:02:15.360> um<00:02:16.220> reload

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
i believe is wallbang also but um reload

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.450 
i believe is wallbang also but um reload

now<00:02:23.190> 80<00:02:23.490> coupons<00:02:24.120> it<00:02:24.420> was<00:02:24.540> recently<00:02:24.930> raised

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
now 80 coupons it was recently raised

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.250 
now 80 coupons it was recently raised
from<00:02:25.440> 60<00:02:26.010> n<00:02:26.190> in<00:02:26.370> my<00:02:26.520> opinion<00:02:26.790> not<00:02:27.570> worth<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:28.050> 80

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
from 60 n in my opinion not worth the 80

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.400 
from 60 n in my opinion not worth the 80
um<00:02:28.740> I<00:02:29.190> said<00:02:29.910> I<00:02:29.970> think<00:02:30.330> the<00:02:30.450> red<00:02:30.690> dot<00:02:30.900> sight<00:02:31.290> is

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
um I said I think the red dot sight is

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.980 
um I said I think the red dot sight is
completely<00:02:31.920> useless<00:02:32.330> so<00:02:33.330> something<00:02:33.750> like<00:02:33.780> an

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
completely useless so something like an

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.230 
completely useless so something like an
m4<00:02:34.380> silver<00:02:34.800> and<00:02:35.130> for<00:02:35.340> advanced<00:02:35.820> will<00:02:36.000> suit

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
m4 silver and for advanced will suit

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.260 
m4 silver and for advanced will suit
your<00:02:36.390> needs<00:02:36.630> just<00:02:37.140> as<00:02:37.320> a<00:02:37.490> good<00:02:38.490> as<00:02:38.700> that<00:02:38.730> m4

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
your needs just as a good as that m4

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.520 
your needs just as a good as that m4
custom<00:02:39.900> will<00:02:41.270> as<00:02:42.270> again<00:02:42.720> I<00:02:42.750> said<00:02:43.110> thirty<00:02:43.290> five

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
custom will as again I said thirty five

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.530 
custom will as again I said thirty five

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
rounds in a magazine which is basically

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.720 
rounds in a magazine which is basically
what<00:02:45.810> any<00:02:46.050> variant<00:02:46.650> of<00:02:46.800> any<00:02:46.980> weapon<00:02:47.400> has<00:02:47.550> an

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
what any variant of any weapon has an

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.080 
what any variant of any weapon has an
additional<00:02:47.970> five<00:02:48.630> runs<00:02:49.100> and<00:02:50.100> it's<00:02:50.310> fires<00:02:50.910> at

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
additional five runs and it's fires at

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.900 
additional five runs and it's fires at
ten<00:02:51.330> rounds<00:02:51.660> of<00:02:51.780> segments<00:02:52.140> which<00:02:52.230> basically<00:02:52.500> a

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
ten rounds of segments which basically a

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.050 
ten rounds of segments which basically a
AK<00:02:53.910> damage<00:02:54.660> now<00:02:55.350> not<00:02:55.800> all<00:02:55.830> M<00:02:56.160> forest<00:02:56.520> fire<00:02:56.730> ten

AK damage now not all M forest fire ten

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.290 
AK damage now not all M forest fire ten
rounds<00:02:57.300> a<00:02:57.360> second<00:02:57.720> sub<00:02:57.870> fire<00:02:58.080> faster<00:02:59.300> not

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
rounds a second sub fire faster not

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.140 
rounds a second sub fire faster not
think<00:03:00.570> any<00:03:00.720> far<00:03:00.930> slower<00:03:01.320> though<00:03:01.700> now<00:03:02.700> a<00:03:02.730> lot<00:03:03.120> of

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
think any far slower though now a lot of

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.600 
think any far slower though now a lot of
people<00:03:03.240> ask<00:03:03.810> which<00:03:04.560> one<00:03:04.590> is<00:03:04.890> better<00:03:05.070> this<00:03:05.370> or

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
people ask which one is better this or

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.050 
people ask which one is better this or
the<00:03:05.940> custom<00:03:06.450> crystal<00:03:06.900> and<00:03:07.400> it<00:03:08.400> for<00:03:08.790> me<00:03:08.910> it

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
the custom crystal and it for me it

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.640 
the custom crystal and it for me it
depends<00:03:09.390> what<00:03:09.600> mode<00:03:09.870> you're<00:03:10.020> playing<00:03:10.290> what

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.320 
differences actually well yet three
differences<00:04:00.690> between<00:04:01.260> the<00:04:01.650> m4<00:04:02.400> custom<00:04:02.880> and<00:04:03.030> m4

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
differences between the m4 custom and m4

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.270 
differences between the m4 custom and m4
coastal<00:04:03.690> crystal<00:04:04.050> when<00:04:04.560> it<00:04:04.680> comes<00:04:04.860> to<00:04:05.010> stats

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
coastal crystal when it comes to stats

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.640 
coastal crystal when it comes to stats
and<00:04:05.760> for<00:04:06.120> custom<00:04:06.510> personal<00:04:06.840> isn't<00:04:07.170> a<00:04:07.200> one-shot

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
and for custom personal isn't a one-shot

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.760 
and for custom personal isn't a one-shot
head<00:04:07.830> shot<00:04:08.070> at<00:04:08.250> long<00:04:08.490> range<00:04:08.820> which<00:04:09.780> is<00:04:09.810> a<00:04:10.140> huge

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.770 
head shot at long range which is a huge

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.760 
head shot at long range which is a huge
problem<00:04:11.459> for<00:04:11.490> people<00:04:12.000> like<00:04:12.360> me<00:04:12.420> I<00:04:12.900> want<00:04:13.680> my

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770 
problem for people like me I want my

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.729 
problem for people like me I want my
weapons<00:04:14.370> to<00:04:14.550> be<00:04:14.730> one<00:04:14.940> shot<00:04:15.209> head<00:04:15.420> shot<00:04:15.720> at<00:04:16.470> long

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
weapons to be one shot head shot at long

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.099 
weapons to be one shot head shot at long
range<00:04:17.100> and<00:04:17.489> if<00:04:17.670> you<00:04:17.820> have<00:04:18.030> bulletproof<00:04:18.720> helmet

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
range and if you have bulletproof helmet

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:25.710 
range and if you have bulletproof helmet
on<00:04:20.420> ak-47<00:04:21.420> right<00:04:21.630> there<00:04:21.919> so<00:04:23.780> yeah

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
on ak-47 right there so yeah

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.620 
on ak-47 right there so yeah
not<00:04:26.350> really<00:04:26.740> good<00:04:27.220> considering<00:04:28.210> that<00:04:28.360> it<00:04:28.510> m

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
not really good considering that it m

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.540 
not really good considering that it m
for<00:04:29.170> custom<00:04:29.620> crystal<00:04:29.980> is<00:04:30.070> gonna<00:04:30.250> want<00:04:30.430> your

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
for custom crystal is gonna want your

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.170 
for custom crystal is gonna want your
head<00:04:30.700> shot<00:04:30.880> at<00:04:31.000> long<00:04:31.240> range<00:04:32.820> also<00:04:33.820> it<00:04:34.060> has

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
head shot at long range also it has

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.140 
head shot at long range also it has
slightly<00:04:34.840> lower<00:04:35.200> damage<00:04:35.530> for<00:04:35.890> years<00:04:36.150> I'm

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
slightly lower damage for years I'm

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.520 
slightly lower damage for years I'm
going<00:04:37.300> to<00:04:37.360> be<00:04:37.420> doing<00:04:37.540> a<00:04:37.720> little<00:04:37.930> less<00:04:38.080> damage<00:04:38.440> i

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
going to be doing a little less damage i

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.740 
going to be doing a little less damage i
believe<00:04:38.800> overall<00:04:39.370> it's<00:04:39.580> a<00:04:39.760> same<00:04:40.270> shots<00:04:40.570> to

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
believe overall it's a same shots to

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.560 
believe overall it's a same shots to
kill<00:04:40.930> maybe<00:04:41.260> except<00:04:41.620> the<00:04:41.740> leg<00:04:42.180> but<00:04:43.180> I<00:04:43.210> think<00:04:43.450> at

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
kill maybe except the leg but I think at

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.330 
kill maybe except the leg but I think at
long<00:04:43.780> ranges<00:04:44.260> when<00:04:44.530> it<00:04:44.650> changes<00:04:45.010> i'm<00:04:45.160> not

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
long ranges when it changes i'm not

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.550 
long ranges when it changes i'm not
exactly<00:04:45.940> positive<00:04:46.270> on<00:04:46.690> the<00:04:46.810> stats<00:04:47.050> a<00:04:47.260> long

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
exactly positive on the stats a long

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.590 
exactly positive on the stats a long
range<00:04:47.770> for<00:04:48.040> the<00:04:48.100> custom<00:04:48.430> crystal<00:04:48.790> except<00:04:49.510> that

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
range for the custom crystal except that

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.100 
range for the custom crystal except that
it's<00:04:49.720> not<00:04:49.810> a<00:04:49.870> one-shot<00:04:50.230> headshot<00:04:50.590> and<00:04:52.110> they're

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
it's not a one-shot headshot and they're

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.340 
it's not a one-shot headshot and they're
also<00:04:53.290> the<00:04:53.680> m4<00:04:54.100> custom<00:04:54.430> crystal<00:04:54.760> though<00:04:54.940> as<00:04:55.930> far

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
also the m4 custom crystal though as far

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:57.990 
also the m4 custom crystal though as far
as<00:04:56.530> all<00:04:56.740> those<00:04:56.890> bad<00:04:57.130> things<00:04:57.370> actually<00:04:57.670> has<00:04:57.970> a

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
as all those bad things actually has a

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.520 
as all those bad things actually has a
faster<00:04:58.510> fiery<00:04:59.460> but<00:05:00.460> i<00:05:00.490> think<00:05:00.730> about<00:05:01.450> two<00:05:01.810> extra

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 
faster fiery but i think about two extra

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.230 
faster fiery but i think about two extra
rounds<00:05:02.860> a<00:05:02.950> second<00:05:03.400> now<00:05:03.550> that<00:05:03.730> might<00:05:03.880> not<00:05:04.000> seem

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
rounds a second now that might not seem

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:09.930 
rounds a second now that might not seem
like<00:05:04.300> a<00:05:04.450> lot<00:05:04.600> but<00:05:05.040> trust<00:05:06.040> me<00:05:06.130> it<00:05:06.460> is<00:05:08.370> so<00:05:09.370> which

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
like a lot but trust me it is so which

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.090 
like a lot but trust me it is so which
one<00:05:10.180> is<00:05:10.300> better<00:05:10.450> custom<00:05:10.990> or<00:05:11.290> custom<00:05:11.650> pistol

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.100 
one is better custom or custom pistol

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.730 
one is better custom or custom pistol
like<00:05:12.760> I<00:05:12.790> said<00:05:12.910> map<00:05:13.300> and<00:05:13.630> mode<00:05:13.960> if<00:05:14.140> your<00:05:14.260> plan<00:05:14.560> if

like I said map and mode if your plan if

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.270 
like I said map and mode if your plan if
you<00:05:14.860> play<00:05:15.040> a<00:05:15.070> lot<00:05:15.250> of<00:05:15.400> long-range<00:05:15.850> maps<00:05:17.280> just

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 
you play a lot of long-range maps just

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.980 
you play a lot of long-range maps just
go<00:05:18.490> with<00:05:18.520> them<00:05:18.820> for<00:05:19.030> custom<00:05:19.510> you<00:05:19.600> know<00:05:19.720> if<00:05:19.840> you

go with them for custom you know if you

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.240 
go with them for custom you know if you

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
long-range maps then this the end for

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.460 
long-range maps then this the end for
custom<00:05:30.190> will<00:05:30.370> do<00:05:30.610> are<00:05:30.760> just<00:05:31.150> fine<00:05:31.390> and<00:05:31.750> will<00:05:32.350> be

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470 
custom will do are just fine and will be

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.200 
custom will do are just fine and will be
better<00:05:32.650> than<00:05:32.770> the<00:05:32.890> custom<00:05:33.280> crystal<00:05:33.640> now<00:05:34.150> if

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
better than the custom crystal now if

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.030 
better than the custom crystal now if
you<00:05:34.300> do<00:05:34.450> medium<00:05:34.870> to<00:05:35.020> close<00:05:35.260> range<00:05:35.530> maps<00:05:35.770> i

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:36.040 
you do medium to close range maps i

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.030 
you do medium to close range maps i
would<00:05:36.880> go<00:05:37.090> with<00:05:37.120> the<00:05:37.660> custom<00:05:38.230> crystal<00:05:38.620> because

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:39.040 
would go with the custom crystal because

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.350 
would go with the custom crystal because
you're<00:05:39.310> not<00:05:39.400> going<00:05:39.550> to<00:05:39.610> be<00:05:39.669> really<00:05:39.910> seeing<00:05:40.150> uh

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
you're not going to be really seeing uh

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.750 
you're not going to be really seeing uh
any<00:05:40.690> any<00:05:41.320> problem<00:05:41.740> with<00:05:41.800> it<00:05:41.950> so<00:05:42.190> one<00:05:42.460> shot<00:05:42.640> head

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:42.760 
any any problem with it so one shot head

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.570 
any any problem with it so one shot head
shot<00:05:43.000> at<00:05:43.290> close<00:05:44.290> to<00:05:44.410> medium<00:05:44.919> range<00:05:45.190> and<00:05:45.460> the

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:45.580 
shot at close to medium range and the

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.719 
shot at close to medium range and the
damage<00:05:45.790> drop<00:05:46.240> off<00:05:46.660> it's<00:05:47.620> not<00:05:47.740> that<00:05:47.800> big<00:05:48.460> so

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:48.729 
damage drop off it's not that big so

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:49.680 
damage drop off it's not that big so
you're<00:05:48.910> not<00:05:48.970> really<00:05:49.210> going<00:05:49.419> to<00:05:49.479> notice

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:49.690 
you're not really going to notice

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:51.469 
you're not really going to notice
difference<00:05:50.229> but<00:05:50.500> you're<00:05:50.650> going<00:05:50.740> to<00:05:50.830> be<00:05:50.979> doing

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:51.479 
difference but you're going to be doing

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:54.420 
difference but you're going to be doing
you're<00:05:52.479> going<00:05:52.630> to<00:05:52.690> be<00:05:53.010> putting<00:05:54.010> out<00:05:54.220> more

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.430 
you're going to be putting out more

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.610 
you're going to be putting out more
rounds<00:05:54.850> every<00:05:55.419> second<00:05:56.110> so<00:05:56.320> you're<00:05:56.410> going<00:05:56.560> to

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:56.620 
rounds every second so you're going to

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:57.900 
rounds every second so you're going to
be<00:05:56.680> able<00:05:56.710> to<00:05:56.890> kill<00:05:57.010> your<00:05:57.130> opponent's<00:05:57.520> faster

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:57.910

and<00:05:58.090> not<00:05:58.780> really<00:05:58.930> have<00:05:59.200> it<00:05:59.760> anything<00:06:00.760> negative

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:00.970 
and not really have it anything negative

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:04.409 
and not really have it anything negative
about<00:06:01.270> it<00:06:01.570> now<00:06:02.169> when<00:06:02.710> I<00:06:02.740> say<00:06:03.010> mode<00:06:03.430> I<00:06:03.729> meant

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:04.419 
about it now when I say mode I meant

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:07.080 
about it now when I say mode I meant
specifically<00:06:05.290> ghost<00:06:05.710> mode<00:06:05.950> now<00:06:06.669> both<00:06:07.060> these

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.090 
specifically ghost mode now both these

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:10.230 
specifically ghost mode now both these
weapons<00:06:07.570> are<00:06:07.630> suppressed<00:06:08.550> but<00:06:09.550> I<00:06:09.610> would<00:06:09.910> take

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.240 
weapons are suppressed but I would take

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.750 
weapons are suppressed but I would take
the<00:06:10.419> F<00:06:10.570> for<00:06:10.840> custom<00:06:11.229> crystal<00:06:11.650> because<00:06:12.310> of<00:06:12.580> that

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:12.760 
the F for custom crystal because of that

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.640 
the F for custom crystal because of that
faster<00:06:13.330> fire<00:06:13.660> rate<00:06:13.960> you're<00:06:14.290> going<00:06:14.320> to<00:06:14.500> be<00:06:14.560> able

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:14.650 
faster fire rate you're going to be able

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:17.460 
faster fire rate you're going to be able
to<00:06:14.860> kill<00:06:15.010> ghost<00:06:15.310> faster<00:06:15.990> that's<00:06:16.990> why<00:06:17.200> I<00:06:17.229> would

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:17.470 
to kill ghost faster that's why I would

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:19.469 
to kill ghost faster that's why I would
take<00:06:17.650> an<00:06:17.830> for<00:06:18.160> custom<00:06:18.490> crystal<00:06:18.850> for<00:06:19.090> you<00:06:19.270> go

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:19.479 
take an for custom crystal for you go

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:22.050 
take an for custom crystal for you go
smoke<00:06:19.720> clears<00:06:20.040> but<00:06:21.040> overall<00:06:21.550> it's<00:06:21.880> going<00:06:22.000> to

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:22.060 
smoke clears but overall it's going to

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.630 
smoke clears but overall it's going to
be<00:06:22.120> really<00:06:22.300> the<00:06:22.390> end<00:06:22.510> for<00:06:23.260> this<00:06:23.530> review<00:06:23.830> I<00:06:24.340> hope
