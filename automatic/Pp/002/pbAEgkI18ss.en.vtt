00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.099
 the devil was shot for some time 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:16.309
 it seemed that we would have peace but it was not the 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.309
 what happened 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.220
 the devil is a very complex methodology 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:31.900
 Well, we had a lot of preparation 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.980
 big had a very great anxiety 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.660
 of the fans, right? 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.000
 more and more companies seek to bring 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:40.410
 the Portuguese games 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.370
 I would say from four years to here 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.059
 quadrupled the market 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:56.769
 You were well rounded at your job. 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:01:00.250
 here is over and now everyone runs the 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:02.829
 dubbing her besides dodo when she is 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.660
 a good location, that is to say, the 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.429
 themes are well applied 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.700
 the interpretation is good the good location 

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:10.450
 It's good, she's got a lot of immersion. 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.000
 great 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.490
 This makes the player easier when you 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.140
 hear your own mother language is different 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.750
 understand you need your referral 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:23.070
 to accept what you 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.070
 is seeing an easier way 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.300
 who has not played or does not know the 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.970
 devil to those who have not played is 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:36.930
 crusader is a new class shoots the figure 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.580
 central in the franchise then he from 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.390
 now play an important role in this 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.700
 expansion 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.500
 the cruise has a way to specific 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.240
 Speaking of some scenes does not 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.640
 He has moments that he is well. 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.640
 aggressive a psychotic thing, right? 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.460
 My grave, but I'm going to destroy you. 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.990
 At the moment he's really hot, like her. 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.630
 So it's okay, you want to do it well. 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.810
 can do so is varies greatly 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.420
 long ago hundreds of warriors 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:07.100
 loyal departed on a sacred mission 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:11.149
 to the swamp lands of the east where 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.149
 disappeared without a trace 

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:21.629
 other characters that already of the player that 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:24.000
 draws start by example is angry 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:26.280
 the melan giraffe from madagascar to em 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.709
 movies or the iron that I've done several 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.049
 movies and hellboy and also that I 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.359
 I did the 2 to 1 to I think maybe the 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:36.420
 rebound approach more in some 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:39.209
 moments the doorbell with a crusader beside 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:51.209
 back this side of the genre that all 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:54.959
 world knows and actors matrix and unique 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:57.329
 jackson movie and a lot of will 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.700
 smith of the man in black I think the 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:02.310
 big difference is that we do not have 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.439
 in most cases the reference 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.569
 if you are not recording 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:08.730
 listen to the audio and you do not know 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.709
 exactly what is happening and 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:14.220
 take this put what you think of it 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:18.439
 so you do not know sometimes but by the 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.439
 interpretation can you get there 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.860
 It is a complex game it is too large to 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.010
 people should be speaking today something 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:33.370
 together with the expansion of 25 thousand 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:37.459
 audio files then are more than 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:39.230
 50 thousand you speak in the whole game and you have 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:44.500
 the consistency of doing this with everyone 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:47.390
 the 12 heroes now nÃ© ii where all the 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.920
 all the characters fits like this is 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.709
 it was amy it's hard working a lot 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.290
 Difficult, I thank the team very much. 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:57.200
 both the audio operators and the 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.330
 mediators as the actors themselves 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:03.260
 the translators we managed 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:05.269
 bring together an incredible team to 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:12.460
 do a complex job as it gives 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:18.690
 It's going to deter 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:18.690
 dengue is a hatred that death
