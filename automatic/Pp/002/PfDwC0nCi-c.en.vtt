like<00:00:45.149> that<00:00:45.210> where<00:00:45.539> I<00:00:45.570> can't<00:00:45.809> really<00:00:46.200> have<00:00:46.410> a

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440

ton of different things with me to film
I<00:00:48.450> also<00:00:48.719> use<00:00:48.989> this<00:00:49.140> little<00:00:49.289> Sony<00:00:49.620> Handycam

I also use this little Sony Handycam
it's<00:00:51.180> quite<00:00:51.390> smaller<00:00:51.690> so<00:00:52.020> it's<00:00:52.170> easier<00:00:52.230> to

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
it's quite smaller so it's easier to

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.200 
it's quite smaller so it's easier to
travel<00:00:52.800> with<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.550> can<00:00:53.670> film<00:00:53.850> for<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.030> very

on the hard drive that comes on it I

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.099 
on the hard drive that comes on it I
don't<00:00:59.550> even<00:00:59.670> have<00:00:59.910> an<00:01:00.210> SD<00:01:00.539> card<00:01:00.570> for<00:01:01.020> this

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.990 
don't even have an SD card for this
camera<00:01:01.500> I<00:01:01.620> don't<00:01:01.710> I've<00:01:02.010> never<00:01:02.309> needed<00:01:02.460> one<00:01:02.609> so

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
camera I don't I've never needed one so

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.060 
camera I don't I've never needed one so
it's<00:01:03.210> pretty<00:01:03.780> cool<00:01:04.019> because<00:01:04.379> I<00:01:04.530> can<00:01:04.589> film<00:01:04.890> for

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
it's pretty cool because I can film for

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.440 
it's pretty cool because I can film for
longer<00:01:05.309> periods<00:01:05.640> of<00:01:05.700> time<00:01:05.760> with<00:01:06.060> this<00:01:06.180> camera

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
longer periods of time with this camera

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.080 
longer periods of time with this camera
I<00:01:06.810> use<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.350> for<00:01:07.590> my<00:01:07.650> crafting<00:01:08.369> videos<00:01:08.700> where

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090

I use it for my crafting videos where
I'm<00:01:09.180> going<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.390> be<00:01:09.450> filming<00:01:09.780> for<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:09.960> long<00:01:10.140> time

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
I'm going to be filming for a long time

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.840 
I'm going to be filming for a long time
and<00:01:10.740> because<00:01:11.010> of<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.220> flip<00:01:11.400> screen<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:11.760> great

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
and because of the flip screen is great

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.609 
and because of the flip screen is great
for<00:01:12.150> travel<00:01:12.479> videos<00:01:12.810> where<00:01:13.049> I<00:01:13.080> don't<00:01:13.170> have<00:01:13.439> my

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
laptop set up with me unless there's a

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.800 
laptop set up with me unless there's a
ton<00:01:16.920> of<00:01:16.950> natural<00:01:17.220> light<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:17.970> really<00:01:18.360> just

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
ton of natural light it really just

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.270 
ton of natural light it really just
doesn't<00:01:19.020> look<00:01:19.229> so<00:01:19.409> great<00:01:19.560> if<00:01:19.860> I<00:01:20.040> don't<00:01:20.159> have

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280

it<00:01:36.390> auto<00:01:36.570> focuses<00:01:37.170> so<00:01:37.500> that's<00:01:37.650> extremely

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
it auto focuses so that's extremely

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.010

to put it on my computer and find out
that<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:50.729> doesn't<00:01:50.909> really<00:01:51.149> look<00:01:51.329> very<00:01:51.390> good

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780

for<00:01:54.990> video<00:01:55.320> on<00:01:55.350> this<00:01:55.590> camera<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.430> I<00:01:56.549> haven't

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
for video on this camera and I haven't

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.520 
for video on this camera and I haven't
used<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.180> for<00:01:57.600> more<00:01:57.750> than<00:01:57.810> 20<00:01:58.140> minutes<00:01:58.409> at<00:01:58.500> a

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
used it for more than 20 minutes at a

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.840 
used it for more than 20 minutes at a
time<00:01:58.710> so<00:01:58.920> I<00:01:58.979> don't<00:01:59.040> know<00:01:59.340> if<00:01:59.490> it's<00:01:59.610> going<00:01:59.759> to

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
time so I don't know if it's going to

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.639 
time so I don't know if it's going to
overheat<00:02:00.360> in<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.600> same<00:02:00.780> way<00:02:00.930> that<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.200> DSLR

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
overheat in the same way that the DSLR

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.920 
overheat in the same way that the DSLR
does<00:02:02.009> but<00:02:02.579> in<00:02:02.790> general<00:02:03.149> so<00:02:03.360> far<00:02:03.570> I'm<00:02:03.659> really

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
does but in general so far I'm really

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:04.580 
does but in general so far I'm really
happy<00:02:04.079> with<00:02:04.350> it

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
happy with it

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.810 
happy with it
I<00:02:04.740> believe<00:02:05.070> it<00:02:05.159> actually<00:02:05.280> has<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.549> bigger

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
I believe it actually has a bigger

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.330 
I believe it actually has a bigger
sensor<00:02:06.329> than<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.840> sensor<00:02:07.170> in<00:02:07.409> my<00:02:07.560> DSLR<00:02:08.160> which

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
sensor than the sensor in my DSLR which

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.339 
sensor than the sensor in my DSLR which
is<00:02:08.520> crazy<00:02:08.759> that<00:02:09.179> technology<00:02:09.750> is<00:02:09.869> advanced

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
is crazy that technology is advanced

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.380 
is crazy that technology is advanced
that<00:02:10.530> much<00:02:10.770> and<00:02:11.009> like<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.610> 5<00:02:11.790> years<00:02:12.030> since<00:02:12.270> I

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
that much and like the 5 years since I

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.970 
that much and like the 5 years since I
bought<00:02:12.569> this<00:02:12.720> other<00:02:12.900> camera<00:02:13.200> so<00:02:13.890> it's

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
bought this other camera so it's

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.500 
bought this other camera so it's
actually<00:02:14.099> looking<00:02:14.370> like<00:02:14.730> this<00:02:14.940> new<00:02:15.090> camera<00:02:15.300> is

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
actually looking like this new camera is

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.119 
actually looking like this new camera is
going<00:02:15.660> to<00:02:15.750> combine<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.290> strengths<00:02:16.680> of<00:02:16.770> my<00:02:17.069> two

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
going to combine the strengths of my two

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:19.220 
going to combine the strengths of my two
other<00:02:17.459> cameras<00:02:17.970> and<00:02:18.209> hopefully<00:02:18.780> I'll<00:02:18.959> be<00:02:19.140> able

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
other cameras and hopefully I'll be able

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.770 
other cameras and hopefully I'll be able
to<00:02:19.410> just<00:02:20.040> carry<00:02:20.520> around<00:02:20.700> one<00:02:20.970> camera<00:02:21.450> with<00:02:21.599> me

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
to just carry around one camera with me

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.690 
to just carry around one camera with me
from<00:02:21.989> now<00:02:22.110> on<00:02:22.349> I'm<00:02:22.980> excited<00:02:23.430> to<00:02:23.520> take<00:02:23.670> it

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
from now on I'm excited to take it

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.610 
from now on I'm excited to take it
outside<00:02:23.879> with<00:02:24.209> me<00:02:24.330> and<00:02:24.480> see<00:02:24.690> how<00:02:24.900> it<00:02:25.290> handles

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
outside with me and see how it handles

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.430 
outside with me and see how it handles
filming<00:02:26.370> like<00:02:26.760> action<00:02:27.239> and<00:02:27.480> candid<00:02:27.930> shots<00:02:28.170> and

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
filming like action and candid shots and

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.809 
filming like action and candid shots and
things<00:02:28.560> like<00:02:28.800> that<00:02:28.860> and<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.459> timing<00:02:29.670> is

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
things like that and the timing is

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.610 
things like that and the timing is
actually<00:02:30.090> perfect<00:02:30.480> because<00:02:30.840> I<00:02:31.200> recently

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
actually perfect because I recently

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:32.839 
actually perfect because I recently
found<00:02:31.950> out<00:02:32.160> that<00:02:32.250> I'm<00:02:32.340> going<00:02:32.430> to<00:02:32.519> be<00:02:32.580> going<00:02:32.760> to

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
found out that I'm going to be going to

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:34.640 
found out that I'm going to be going to
VidCon<00:02:32.970> in<00:02:33.330> a<00:02:33.390> couple<00:02:33.660> weeks<00:02:33.780> so<00:02:34.080> I<00:02:34.110> am<00:02:34.349> super

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
VidCon in a couple weeks so I am super

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.259 
VidCon in a couple weeks so I am super
excited<00:02:34.920> about<00:02:35.310> that<00:02:35.459> it's<00:02:35.849> gonna<00:02:36.000> be<00:02:36.150> my

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
excited about that it's gonna be my

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.290 
excited about that it's gonna be my
first<00:02:36.480> one<00:02:36.599> and<00:02:36.750> I'm<00:02:37.560> notoriously<00:02:38.190> bad<00:02:38.790> with

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
first one and I'm notoriously bad with

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.720 
first one and I'm notoriously bad with
remembering<00:02:40.260> to<00:02:40.470> film<00:02:40.680> things<00:02:40.980> falling<00:02:41.400> I'm

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
remembering to film things falling I'm

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.460 
remembering to film things falling I'm
at<00:02:41.849> conferences<00:02:42.450> so<00:02:42.780> we'll<00:02:43.050> see<00:02:43.260> how<00:02:43.410> that

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
at conferences so we'll see how that

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.550 
at conferences so we'll see how that
goes<00:02:43.800> as<00:02:44.640> far<00:02:44.970> as<00:02:45.090> lighting<00:02:45.480> goes<00:02:45.660> I<00:02:45.959> got<00:02:46.349> a

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
goes as far as lighting goes I got a

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.350 
goes as far as lighting goes I got a
basic<00:02:47.010> three<00:02:47.220> point<00:02:47.550> lighting<00:02:47.730> set<00:02:48.120> for

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
basic three point lighting set for

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.089 
basic three point lighting set for
Christmas<00:02:48.750> last<00:02:48.989> year<00:02:49.170> that's<00:02:49.680> made<00:02:49.860> it<00:02:49.980> so<00:02:50.069> I

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
Christmas last year that's made it so I

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:51.619 
Christmas last year that's made it so I
can<00:02:50.310> film<00:02:50.459> in<00:02:50.580> my<00:02:50.670> craft<00:02:50.910> studio<00:02:51.330> which<00:02:51.599> has

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:51.629 
can film in my craft studio which has

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:53.540 
can film in my craft studio which has
very<00:02:52.019> little<00:02:52.230> natural<00:02:52.470> light<00:02:52.950> in<00:02:53.160> it<00:02:53.340> even

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
very little natural light in it even

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.550 
very little natural light in it even
though<00:02:53.700> I<00:02:53.730> have<00:02:53.970> this<00:02:54.180> big<00:02:54.420> window<00:02:54.599> the<00:02:55.349> Sun

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
though I have this big window the Sun

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.170 
though I have this big window the Sun
doesn't<00:02:56.040> ever<00:02:56.220> come<00:02:56.489> in<00:02:56.610> from<00:02:56.790> this<00:02:56.910> side<00:02:56.970> of

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
doesn't ever come in from this side of

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.690 
doesn't ever come in from this side of
the<00:02:57.300> house<00:02:57.480> and<00:02:57.780> so<00:02:58.590> it's<00:02:58.800> pretty<00:02:59.159> much<00:02:59.430> always

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
the house and so it's pretty much always

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.670 
the house and so it's pretty much always
dark<00:03:00.090> in<00:03:00.239> here<00:03:00.420> I'm<00:03:00.840> still<00:03:01.260> trying<00:03:01.470> to<00:03:01.500> figure

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
dark in here I'm still trying to figure

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.990 
dark in here I'm still trying to figure
out<00:03:01.739> the<00:03:01.890> best<00:03:01.980> placement<00:03:02.250> for<00:03:02.640> these<00:03:02.790> lights

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
out the best placement for these lights

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.119 
out the best placement for these lights
because<00:03:03.420> I<00:03:03.750> have<00:03:03.870> glasses<00:03:04.110> and<00:03:04.769> sometimes<00:03:05.040> you

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129 
because I have glasses and sometimes you

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:07.130 
because I have glasses and sometimes you
can<00:03:05.280> see<00:03:05.430> the<00:03:05.519> reflections<00:03:06.120> in<00:03:06.390> them<00:03:06.599> but<00:03:07.050> I'm

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
can see the reflections in them but I'm

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.360 
can see the reflections in them but I'm
getting<00:03:07.349> better<00:03:07.440> at<00:03:07.709> it<00:03:07.739> and<00:03:08.040> it's<00:03:08.159> better

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
getting better at it and it's better

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.580 
getting better at it and it's better
than<00:03:08.489> having<00:03:08.730> dark<00:03:09.090> videos<00:03:09.480> also<00:03:09.840> before<00:03:10.560> I

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
than having dark videos also before I

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.500 
than having dark videos also before I
got<00:03:10.890> these<00:03:11.040> lights<00:03:11.370> I<00:03:11.580> pretty<00:03:11.879> much<00:03:11.970> had<00:03:12.300> to

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
got these lights I pretty much had to

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.540 
got these lights I pretty much had to
schedule<00:03:12.720> my<00:03:12.989> video<00:03:13.230> making<00:03:13.500> for<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:14.159> morning

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
schedule my video making for the morning

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.250 
schedule my video making for the morning
when<00:03:14.790> there<00:03:15.030> was<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:15.269> most<00:03:15.450> natural<00:03:15.629> light<00:03:16.080> in

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
when there was the most natural light in

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.140 
when there was the most natural light in
my<00:03:16.379> house<00:03:16.560> and<00:03:17.099> I<00:03:17.310> had<00:03:17.459> to<00:03:17.580> pick<00:03:17.849> where

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
my house and I had to pick where

my house and I had to pick where
recorded<00:03:18.750> based<00:03:19.019> on<00:03:19.319> where<00:03:19.890> the<00:03:20.040> lighting<00:03:20.340> was

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
recorded based on where the lighting was

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.009 
recorded based on where the lighting was
best<00:03:20.700> now<00:03:20.970> I<00:03:21.000> can<00:03:21.239> kind<00:03:21.360> of<00:03:21.480> do<00:03:21.569> it<00:03:21.599> anywhere<00:03:21.989> I

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019

for a busy person like me the tripod I'm

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.440 
for a busy person like me the tripod I'm
using<00:03:27.209> is<00:03:27.510> a<00:03:27.810> Samsonite<00:03:28.580> 2601<00:03:29.580> I<00:03:30.120> got<00:03:30.299> it<00:03:30.390> a

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
using is a Samsonite 2601 I got it a

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.850 
using is a Samsonite 2601 I got it a
long<00:03:30.599> time<00:03:30.659> ago<00:03:30.900> and<00:03:31.319> one<00:03:31.530> of<00:03:31.560> the<00:03:31.709> little

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
long time ago and one of the little

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.250 
long time ago and one of the little
knobs<00:03:32.129> broke<00:03:32.459> off<00:03:32.640> of<00:03:32.670> it<00:03:32.970> it's<00:03:33.780> pretty<00:03:34.080> much

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
knobs broke off of it it's pretty much

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.770 
knobs broke off of it it's pretty much
worked<00:03:34.560> for<00:03:34.769> what<00:03:34.920> I<00:03:34.950> need<00:03:35.159> it<00:03:35.250> to<00:03:35.459> do<00:03:35.610> but<00:03:36.599> I

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
worked for what I need it to do but I

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.149 
worked for what I need it to do but I
think<00:03:37.019> at<00:03:37.110> some<00:03:37.140> point<00:03:37.290> I<00:03:37.620> would<00:03:37.739> like<00:03:37.890> to<00:03:38.010> get

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:38.159 
think at some point I would like to get

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:40.339 
think at some point I would like to get
a<00:03:38.220> smaller<00:03:38.730> tripod<00:03:39.330> since<00:03:39.750> I<00:03:39.840> almost<00:03:39.989> always

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
a smaller tripod since I almost always

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:42.619 
a smaller tripod since I almost always
film<00:03:40.920> on<00:03:41.220> a<00:03:41.250> table<00:03:41.760> and<00:03:41.970> I<00:03:42.030> don't<00:03:42.090> really<00:03:42.420> need

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:42.629 
film on a table and I don't really need

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:44.240 
film on a table and I don't really need
it<00:03:42.780> to<00:03:42.930> be<00:03:43.019> this<00:03:43.170> high<00:03:43.379> up<00:03:43.560> where<00:03:43.890> I<00:03:43.920> have<00:03:44.129> it

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
it to be this high up where I have it

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.490 
it to be this high up where I have it
set<00:03:44.459> right<00:03:44.489> now<00:03:44.670> is<00:03:45.030> the<00:03:45.420> shortest<00:03:46.049> it<00:03:46.290> won't

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
set right now is the shortest it won't

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.229 
set right now is the shortest it won't
go<00:03:46.650> for<00:03:47.040> the<00:03:47.099> last<00:03:47.220> few<00:03:47.400> years<00:03:47.459> I've<00:03:47.909> used

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
go for the last few years I've used

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:49.940 
go for the last few years I've used
iMovie<00:03:48.750> to<00:03:48.930> edit<00:03:49.140> my<00:03:49.230> videos<00:03:49.560> and<00:03:49.830> it's

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
iMovie to edit my videos and it's

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.800 
iMovie to edit my videos and it's
actually<00:03:50.220> suited<00:03:50.519> my<00:03:50.640> needs<00:03:50.670> really<00:03:51.120> well<00:03:51.360> for

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
actually suited my needs really well for

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.330 
actually suited my needs really well for
vlogging<00:03:52.049> I've<00:03:52.290> never<00:03:52.470> really<00:03:52.830> needed<00:03:53.129> more

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
vlogging I've never really needed more

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.979 
vlogging I've never really needed more
than<00:03:53.400> that<00:03:53.730> but<00:03:54.090> recently<00:03:54.390> I<00:03:54.450> actually<00:03:54.659> got

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
than that but recently I actually got

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.080 
than that but recently I actually got
Final<00:03:55.379> Cut<00:03:55.500> Pro<00:03:55.560> 10<00:03:56.069> because<00:03:56.849> I've<00:03:56.970> actually

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
Final Cut Pro 10 because I've actually

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.030 
Final Cut Pro 10 because I've actually
recently<00:03:57.420> had<00:03:57.780> the<00:03:57.900> opportunity<00:03:57.989> to<00:03:58.739> edit

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
channel so I've been using that program

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.149 
channel so I've been using that program
to<00:04:03.180> edit<00:04:03.390> my<00:04:03.599> last<00:04:03.780> couple<00:04:04.019> vlogs<00:04:04.379> and<00:04:04.769> I've

to edit my last couple vlogs and I've

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:06.800 
to edit my last couple vlogs and I've
really<00:04:05.459> liked<00:04:05.640> it<00:04:05.760> so<00:04:05.939> far<00:04:06.090> I<00:04:06.299> haven't<00:04:06.480> really

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
really liked it so far I haven't really

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.089 
really liked it so far I haven't really
learned<00:04:06.989> how<00:04:07.200> to<00:04:07.230> use<00:04:07.349> more<00:04:07.650> of<00:04:07.680> the<00:04:07.830> advanced

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
learned how to use more of the advanced

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:09.530 
learned how to use more of the advanced
settings<00:04:08.519> yet<00:04:08.700> and<00:04:08.819> I'm<00:04:08.879> not<00:04:09.030> even<00:04:09.209> really

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
settings yet and I'm not even really

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.630
