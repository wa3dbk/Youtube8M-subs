which this work hrishitaa Rose always
says<00:00:41.489> that<00:00:41.820> he<00:00:41.940> really<00:00:42.180> doesn't<00:00:42.359> know

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
says that he really doesn't know

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
what impressions he has the reality and

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.000 
what impressions he has the reality and
these<00:00:47.969> impressions<00:00:48.629> are<00:00:49.079> always<00:00:49.109> changing

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
these impressions are always changing

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.880 
these impressions are always changing
just<00:00:50.280> as<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:51.449> appearance<00:00:51.960> of<00:00:52.170> reality<00:00:52.769> is

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
just as the appearance of reality is

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.610 
just as the appearance of reality is
always<00:00:53.309> changing<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:54.179> him<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.989> reality<00:00:55.589> that

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
always changing to him the reality that

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.579 
always changing to him the reality that
he<00:00:55.859> is<00:00:56.449> concerned<00:00:57.449> with<00:00:57.690> of<00:00:57.839> course<00:00:58.079> his<00:00:58.289> paint

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:58.589 
he is concerned with of course his paint

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:01.310 
he is concerned with of course his paint
and<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.940> different<00:01:00.359> ways<00:01:00.570> that<00:01:00.780> he<00:01:00.989> can

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
and the different ways that he can

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.400 
and the different ways that he can
manipulate<00:01:01.589> that<00:01:02.429> matter<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:03.149> so<00:01:03.510> I<00:01:03.870> think

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:04.410 
manipulate that matter and so I think

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.310 
manipulate that matter and so I think
he's<00:01:04.559> painting<00:01:05.160> abstract<00:01:05.970> paintings<00:01:06.510> or

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
he's painting abstract paintings or

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.130 
he's painting abstract paintings or
figurative<00:01:08.310> paintings<00:01:08.909> he<00:01:09.540> does<00:01:09.750> not<00:01:09.900> really

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
figurative paintings he does not really

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:20.550 
figurative paintings he does not really
see<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:11.100> difference<00:01:11.909> between<00:01:12.180> them

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
times it's being superimposed and you

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.110 
times it's being superimposed and you
see<00:03:27.760> him<00:03:28.120> twice<00:03:28.780> on<00:03:29.170> the<00:03:29.560> left<00:03:30.220> hand<00:03:30.459> side<00:03:30.730> and

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
see him twice on the left hand side and

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.259 
see him twice on the left hand side and
once<00:03:31.540> on<00:03:31.780> the<00:03:31.900> right<00:03:32.079> hand<00:03:32.349> side<00:03:32.680> and<00:03:33.010> then<00:03:33.849> on

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
once on the right hand side and then on

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:37.229 
once on the right hand side and then on
each<00:03:34.900> successive<00:03:35.799> print<00:03:36.310> of<00:03:36.519> the<00:03:36.640> photograph

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
each successive print of the photograph

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.470 
each successive print of the photograph
he<00:03:38.049> gradually<00:03:38.650> obliterates<00:03:39.549> his<00:03:39.849> image<00:03:40.209> with

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
he gradually obliterates his image with

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.849 
he gradually obliterates his image with
squeegeed<00:03:41.410> red<00:03:42.190> paint<00:03:43.139> until<00:03:44.139> he's

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:44.859 
squeegeed red paint until he's

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:47.059 
squeegeed red paint until he's
completely<00:03:45.549> disappeared

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
completely disappeared

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:51.900 
completely disappeared
so<00:03:48.069> what<00:03:48.519> is<00:03:48.730> the<00:03:48.880> reality<00:03:49.180> is<00:03:49.989> it<00:03:50.230> the<00:03:51.099> image

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
so what is the reality is it the image

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.599 
so what is the reality is it the image
of<00:03:52.299> himself<00:03:52.750> is<00:03:53.079> ghost<00:03:53.470> the<00:03:53.859> image<00:03:54.129> of<00:03:54.250> himself

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:54.609 
of himself is ghost the image of himself

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:57.629 
of himself is ghost the image of himself
or<00:03:55.030> is<00:03:55.329> it<00:03:55.510> the<00:03:55.840> actual<00:03:56.230> paint<00:03:56.530> he<00:03:57.430> leaves

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:57.639 
or is it the actual paint he leaves

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:17.420 
or is it the actual paint he leaves
these<00:03:57.819> sort<00:03:58.060> of<00:03:58.120> questions<00:03:58.629> open

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.129

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
see behind me in 1982 at this time he

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.330 
see behind me in 1982 at this time he
was<00:04:26.960> either<00:04:27.960> approaching<00:04:28.470> or<00:04:28.979> had<00:04:29.100> just

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
was either approaching or had just

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.870 
was either approaching or had just
become<00:04:29.750> 50<00:04:30.750> years<00:04:30.960> old<00:04:31.169> and<00:04:31.620> I<00:04:32.070> suppose<00:04:32.520> was

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
become 50 years old and I suppose was

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.570 
become 50 years old and I suppose was
experienced<00:04:33.540> in<00:04:34.110> what<00:04:34.440> people<00:04:34.860> now<00:04:35.190> call<00:04:35.550> a

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
experienced in what people now call a

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.020 
experienced in what people now call a

midlife crisis intonation is immortality
and<00:04:39.270> I<00:04:40.199> think<00:04:40.650> felt<00:04:40.979> that<00:04:41.220> the<00:04:41.340> best<00:04:41.490> way<00:04:41.760> to

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790 
and I think felt that the best way to

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.750 
and I think felt that the best way to
confront<00:04:42.389> this<00:04:42.720> was<00:04:43.530> actually<00:04:43.800> to<00:04:44.430> do<00:04:44.610> it

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
confront this was actually to do it

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.650
