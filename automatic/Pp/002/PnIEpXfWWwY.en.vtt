00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.839
 in 2008 saw how yelmer neighbor on the 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.580
 nÃ¼rburgring triumphed on behalf of psv in the 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.620
 super league formula 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.990
 the PSV closes almost three years later 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.820
 and neighbor hands again in one 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.859
 on the circuit of attic in belgium 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.850
 already during a press conference 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:19.920
 announced 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.170
 after three years it is finally weather 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.449
 sometime back in a dutch from the 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.369
 song says so it took a while 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.990
 but then we are busy 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.490
 yes I have the press conference just the 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.590
 So that the feeling feels familiar again 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.020
 slowly my neighbor someone we like anyway 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.610
 know well as even psv and our first 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.620
 color a bit form the public 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.390
 after whether the hour has started and it 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.410
 team bosses wim coeckelberghs with van 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.410
 asserti 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.090
 and nice and close here in the attic 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.070
 Eindhoven Duke too full of this is one 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.020
 nice nice mixes with will the car of 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.780
 psv is being developed by the team at 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.030
 asia for neighbor that one played 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.620
 important role in the choice of PSV 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.320
 became champion last year 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.910
 yes, previously best result that I 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.899
 I earned was in the super league with 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.960
 this team 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.519
 so yes actually that was all free 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.409
 clearly it was only about it 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.460
 budget together and enough 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.810
 to find sponsors 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.340
 the organization of the super league 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.070
 formula has a number of changes 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.869
 implemented so will psv this year 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.640
 represent the Netherlands 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.590
 and that also has an effect on the 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.840
 car where we previously trusted 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.509
 Red white sawing jobs is now mainly 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.799
 the orange color that adorns the polyps 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.509
 think we have a discussion about that 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.579
 because then something more has to be done 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.250
 psv identity on her certainly us in us 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.470
 we logo this piece quite an important 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.909
 element on it but she's focus is whole 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.860
 very international to say 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.329
 that is of course also for you and you 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.009
 likes to race in the Netherlands with the 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.720
 Dutch driver and that is nice 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.240
 close to home and we are also going to race 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.079
 india and in russia and even in new 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.950
 Zealand 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.229
 so it is also very bad somewhere 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.210
 attractive for us to be our brand and so 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.100
 extend far and after they get it 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.900
 other areas and market 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.880
 and then it's time to go the car 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.650
 test and drive yelmer neighbor 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.600
 first laps on the circuit of 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.380
 attic 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.650
 [Music] 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.650
 [Applause] 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.850
 Hi 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.930
 after the first few test rounds 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.240
 neighbor who previously finished second in the 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.430
 final ranking of the super sweet formula 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.080
 high expectations in recent seasons 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.180
 have it actually the beginning 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.610
 very well done 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.870
 yes continuous top 3 hair management for a long time 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.950
 stand championship 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.710
 but then suddenly that all against 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.540
 murphy's looser fortune and everything went 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.740
 miss what can go wrong those last three 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.480
 weekends 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.460
 so yes it just has to go with it 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.530
 i think if it's all most that there 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.700
 got a good chance of really getting it 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.930
 if we measure a shot in front of the bow 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.810
 may do as we did three years ago 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.540
 was in where you were at the end of season 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.490
 number one and the first step is possible 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.500
 be put next week if it 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:57.180
 new season of the super sweet formula 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.180
 starts in axes
