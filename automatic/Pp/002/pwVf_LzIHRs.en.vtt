stands<00:01:09.530> out<00:01:09.740> I<00:01:09.799> don't<00:01:10.130> think<00:01:10.310> I've<00:01:10.520> ever<00:01:10.579> met

00:01:10.809 --> 00:01:10.819 
stands out I don't think I've ever met

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:13.599 
stands out I don't think I've ever met
anyone<00:01:10.969> quite<00:01:11.359> like<00:01:11.719> him<00:01:12.200> where<00:01:12.590> he's<00:01:13.310> able<00:01:13.459> to

00:01:13.599 --> 00:01:13.609 
anyone quite like him where he's able to

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:15.999 
anyone quite like him where he's able to
make<00:01:13.939> a<00:01:13.999> patient<00:01:14.689> feel<00:01:14.810> so<00:01:15.020> comfortable<00:01:15.229> but

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
make a patient feel so comfortable but

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:18.370 
make a patient feel so comfortable but
then<00:01:16.159> he's<00:01:16.369> also<00:01:16.579> excellent<00:01:17.240> and<00:01:17.600> surgery<00:01:18.170> and

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
then he's also excellent and surgery and

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.319 
then he's also excellent and surgery and
I<00:01:18.469> don't<00:01:18.619> think<00:01:18.829> patients<00:01:19.579> realize<00:01:20.119> that

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:20.329 
I don't think patients realize that

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:21.879 
I don't think patients realize that
because<00:01:20.450> they<00:01:20.600> never<00:01:20.719> get<00:01:20.959> to<00:01:21.139> see<00:01:21.350> him<00:01:21.439> in<00:01:21.679> the

00:01:21.879 --> 00:01:21.889 
because they never get to see him in the

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:23.679 
because they never get to see him in the
o.r<00:01:22.009> I<00:01:22.549> think<00:01:22.819> that's<00:01:22.939> what<00:01:23.119> really<00:01:23.299> makes<00:01:23.509> him

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
o.r I think that's what really makes him

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:26.620 
o.r I think that's what really makes him
special<00:01:24.279> the<00:01:25.279> progress<00:01:25.850> in<00:01:26.149> the<00:01:26.270> care<00:01:26.600> of
