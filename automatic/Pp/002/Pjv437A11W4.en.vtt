00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:04.370 
inside I love doing the camera but this

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:11.969 
inside I love doing the camera but this
is<00:01:04.520> really<00:01:04.790> great<00:01:05.030> adventure<00:01:05.720> enjoy<00:01:06.140> watching

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:14.850 

last<00:01:12.430> year<00:01:12.729> there's<00:01:13.090> a<00:01:13.899> couple<00:01:14.530> of<00:01:14.680> difficult

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
last year there's a couple of difficult

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.440 
last year there's a couple of difficult
rounds<00:01:15.520> but<00:01:15.640> most<00:01:15.850> of<00:01:15.969> them<00:01:16.090> are<00:01:16.180> kind<00:01:16.329> of

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
rounds but most of them are kind of

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.630 
rounds but most of them are kind of
medium<00:01:16.869> type<00:01:17.170> rounds<00:01:17.770> there's<00:01:17.950> not<00:01:18.130> a<00:01:18.369> lot<00:01:18.520> of

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
medium type rounds there's not a lot of

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.969 
medium type rounds there's not a lot of
memory<00:01:19.030> or<00:01:19.090> switchers<00:01:19.689> if<00:01:20.439> you're<00:01:20.829> in<00:01:20.920> a

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
memory or switchers if you're in a

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:22.709 
memory or switchers if you're in a
four-way<00:01:21.369> group<00:01:21.640> and<00:01:21.850> you<00:01:21.909> have<00:01:22.090> to<00:01:22.240> switch<00:01:22.509> to

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:22.719 
four-way group and you have to switch to

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:24.450 
four-way group and you have to switch to
another<00:01:22.750> slot<00:01:23.320> if<00:01:23.619> it<00:01:23.740> only<00:01:23.860> turns<00:01:24.280> you

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
another slot if it only turns you

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.100 
another slot if it only turns you
halfway<00:01:24.969> and<00:01:25.210> then<00:01:25.270> you<00:01:25.420> end<00:01:25.630> up<00:01:25.719> being<00:01:25.929> in<00:01:25.990> the

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
halfway and then you end up being in the

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.620 
halfway and then you end up being in the
opposite<00:01:26.500> slot<00:01:26.740> that<00:01:26.950> you're<00:01:27.070> normally<00:01:27.429> in

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
opposite slot that you're normally in

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.169 
opposite slot that you're normally in
the<00:01:28.630> joy<00:01:29.259> tree<00:01:29.590> switchers<00:01:30.009> and<00:01:30.039> VFS<00:01:30.610> and<00:01:30.850> two

00:01:31.169 --> 00:01:31.179 
the joy tree switchers and VFS and two

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:34.440 
the joy tree switchers and VFS and two
of<00:01:31.329> them<00:01:31.479> switch<00:01:32.289> back<00:01:32.590> so<00:01:33.429> in<00:01:33.700> this<00:01:33.909> draw

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
of them switch back so in this draw

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:35.639 
of them switch back so in this draw
because<00:01:34.780> they're<00:01:34.899> pulled<00:01:35.049> together<00:01:35.200> and<00:01:35.530> then

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649 
because they're pulled together and then

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:37.740 
because they're pulled together and then
ones<00:01:35.829> in<00:01:36.039> the<00:01:36.100> jump-off<00:01:36.460> round<00:01:36.789> so<00:01:37.479> that's

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
ones in the jump-off round so that's

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.149 
ones in the jump-off round so that's
kind<00:01:38.020> of<00:01:38.049> cool<00:01:38.200> because<00:01:38.350> I'm<00:01:38.530> one<00:01:38.679> as<00:01:38.770> person

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
kind of cool because I'm one as person

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:41.399 
kind of cool because I'm one as person
people<00:01:39.460> the<00:01:39.549> switches<00:01:39.969> okay<00:01:40.450> it's<00:01:41.020> nice<00:01:41.200> for

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
people the switches okay it's nice for

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:43.800 
people the switches okay it's nice for
me<00:01:41.469> makes<00:01:42.280> a<00:01:42.399> little<00:01:42.640> 'mentally<00:01:43.000> easier<00:01:43.390> focus

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
me makes a little 'mentally easier focus

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.809 
me makes a little 'mentally easier focus
on<00:01:43.929> the<00:01:43.990> flying<00:01:44.200> we're<00:01:44.740> here<00:01:44.860> with<00:01:44.979> the<00:01:45.130> honey

00:01:45.809 --> 00:01:45.819 
on the flying we're here with the honey

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:49.020 
on the flying we're here with the honey
badgers<00:01:46.599> of<00:01:46.929> the<00:01:47.140> Elsinore<00:01:47.500> persuasion<00:01:48.159> the

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
badgers of the Elsinore persuasion the

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.449 
badgers of the Elsinore persuasion the
second<00:01:49.360> year<00:01:49.479> for<00:01:49.689> us<00:01:49.750> we've<00:01:50.140> lost<00:01:50.349> two<00:01:51.280> guys

00:01:51.449 --> 00:01:51.459 
second year for us we've lost two guys

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:53.130 
second year for us we've lost two guys
which<00:01:51.700> are<00:01:51.849> actually<00:01:52.360> two<00:01:52.929> of<00:01:53.020> our

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
which are actually two of our

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.480 
which are actually two of our
competitors<00:01:53.500> on<00:01:53.679> different<00:01:53.979> teams<00:01:54.099> this<00:01:54.310> year

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
competitors on different teams this year

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.639 
competitors on different teams this year
so<00:01:54.849> it's<00:01:54.970> kind<00:01:55.179> of<00:01:55.240> a<00:01:55.390> interesting<00:01:56.140> dynamic

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
so it's kind of a interesting dynamic

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:58.559 
so it's kind of a interesting dynamic
now<00:01:56.799> competing<00:01:57.459> against<00:01:57.819> not<00:01:58.060> one<00:01:58.239> but<00:01:58.420> two

00:01:58.559 --> 00:01:58.569 
now competing against not one but two

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:00.600 
now competing against not one but two
different<00:01:58.750> teams<00:01:59.110> that<00:01:59.439> we<00:02:00.130> actually<00:02:00.459> flew

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
different teams that we actually flew

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.699 
different teams that we actually flew
with<00:02:00.759> last<00:02:00.970> year<00:02:01.209> it<00:02:01.840> might<00:02:02.020> been<00:02:02.200> in<00:02:02.319> the

00:02:02.699 --> 00:02:02.709 
with last year it might been in the

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:05.039 
with last year it might been in the
difference<00:02:03.220> between<00:02:03.340> a<00:02:03.459> four-way<00:02:03.789> belly<00:02:04.060> draw

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
difference between a four-way belly draw

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:09.509 
difference between a four-way belly draw
and<00:02:05.319> a<00:02:05.349> four-way<00:02:05.679> vrw<00:02:06.280> draw<00:02:07.019> is<00:02:08.019> that<00:02:08.519> anyone

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.519 
and a four-way vrw draw is that anyone

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:11.610 
and a four-way vrw draw is that anyone
that<00:02:09.729> has<00:02:09.910> basic<00:02:10.299> skills<00:02:10.720> can<00:02:10.959> can<00:02:11.290> finish<00:02:11.530> a

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
that has basic skills can can finish a

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.190 
that has basic skills can can finish a
full<00:02:11.920> draw<00:02:12.190> on<00:02:12.970> their<00:02:13.150> belly<00:02:13.329> it<00:02:13.780> may<00:02:13.930> not<00:02:14.079> be

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
full draw on their belly it may not be

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.690 
full draw on their belly it may not be
fast<00:02:14.349> but<00:02:14.590> generally<00:02:15.190> you<00:02:15.250> can<00:02:15.400> build<00:02:15.579> all

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
fast but generally you can build all

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.910 
fast but generally you can build all
those<00:02:15.849> points<00:02:16.269> that's<00:02:17.230> not<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:17.560> same<00:02:17.739> with

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
those points that's not the same with

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:18.569 
those points that's not the same with
vrw

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:18.579 
vrw

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:21.059 
vrw
the<00:02:19.420> proximity<00:02:19.870> and<00:02:20.109> the<00:02:20.470> skill<00:02:20.769> level

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
the proximity and the skill level

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:22.710 
the proximity and the skill level
obviously<00:02:21.400> is<00:02:21.459> quite<00:02:21.670> a<00:02:21.700> bit<00:02:21.880> higher<00:02:22.060> if<00:02:22.630> you

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
obviously is quite a bit higher if you

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.050 
obviously is quite a bit higher if you
gave<00:02:22.930> you<00:02:23.410> know<00:02:23.500> four<00:02:23.910> relatively<00:02:24.910> newer

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
gave you know four relatively newer

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.300 
gave you know four relatively newer
skydives<00:02:25.510> that<00:02:25.690> same<00:02:25.930> draw<00:02:26.139> you<00:02:27.040> probably

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
skydives that same draw you probably

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.470 
skydives that same draw you probably
wouldn't<00:02:27.519> even<00:02:27.609> see<00:02:27.790> them<00:02:27.880> in<00:02:27.910> the<00:02:28.030> same<00:02:28.239> sky

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
wouldn't even see them in the same sky

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.039 
wouldn't even see them in the same sky
so<00:02:29.019> I<00:02:29.739> think<00:02:30.280> the<00:02:31.000> amount<00:02:31.510> of<00:02:31.569> discipline

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
so I think the amount of discipline

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:35.099 
so I think the amount of discipline
involved<00:02:32.739> in<00:02:32.950> vrw<00:02:33.609> is<00:02:33.880> obviously<00:02:34.209> very

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:35.109 
involved in vrw is obviously very

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:37.349 
involved in vrw is obviously very
intense<00:02:35.410> speed<00:02:35.950> focus<00:02:36.459> and<00:02:36.639> just<00:02:36.700> just

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:37.359 
intense speed focus and just just

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:39.990 
intense speed focus and just just
generally<00:02:37.690> staying<00:02:37.959> in<00:02:38.109> the<00:02:38.200> same<00:02:38.940> area<00:02:39.940> code

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
generally staying in the same area code

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.289 
generally staying in the same area code
as<00:02:40.420> one<00:02:40.720> another<00:02:40.930> is<00:02:41.350> is<00:02:41.620> huge<00:02:41.980> it's<00:02:42.489> obviously

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
as one another is is huge it's obviously

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:45.210 
as one another is is huge it's obviously
that<00:02:43.420> the<00:02:43.660> speeds<00:02:43.930> are<00:02:44.109> greater<00:02:44.319> in<00:02:44.410> DFS<00:02:44.920> so

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
that the speeds are greater in DFS so

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.460 
that the speeds are greater in DFS so
and<00:02:45.489> we<00:02:45.940> have<00:02:46.120> mistakes<00:02:46.540> or<00:02:46.750> people<00:02:47.139> or<00:02:47.290> teams

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
and we have mistakes or people or teams

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.220 
and we have mistakes or people or teams
have<00:02:47.739> mistakes<00:02:48.190> they're<00:02:48.459> poor<00:02:48.730> amplified<00:02:49.329> so

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
have mistakes they're poor amplified so

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.199 
have mistakes they're poor amplified so
it<00:02:50.349> is<00:02:50.500> definitely<00:02:50.800> challenging<00:02:51.430> and<00:02:52.060> there's

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
it is definitely challenging and there's

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.240 
it is definitely challenging and there's
obviously<00:02:52.360> an<00:02:52.780> additional<00:02:53.290> access<00:02:53.800> like<00:02:54.129> the

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
obviously an additional access like the

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.970 
obviously an additional access like the
vertical<00:02:54.670> axis<00:02:55.120> that's<00:02:55.870> certainly<00:02:56.680> a<00:02:56.739> belly

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
vertical axis that's certainly a belly

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.759 
vertical axis that's certainly a belly
for<00:02:57.550> way<00:02:57.700> as<00:02:57.849> well<00:02:58.060> but<00:02:58.450> it's<00:02:58.780> yeah<00:02:59.410> because

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
for way as well but it's yeah because

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:01.559 
for way as well but it's yeah because
it's<00:03:00.040> speedier<00:03:00.580> it's<00:03:00.879> a<00:03:01.000> little<00:03:01.239> bit<00:03:01.390> more

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
it's speedier it's a little bit more

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:03.619 
it's speedier it's a little bit more
unforgiving

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629

in the next month it was important to

of Dubai Nexus and SDC standard we know

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.360 
of Dubai Nexus and SDC standard we know
they're<00:03:23.140> gonna<00:03:23.260> be<00:03:23.349> there<00:03:23.650> it's<00:03:23.860> good<00:03:24.040> to<00:03:24.190> see

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
they're gonna be there it's good to see

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.520 
they're gonna be there it's good to see
them<00:03:24.519> here<00:03:24.700> before<00:03:25.060> and<00:03:25.239> also<00:03:25.870> we've<00:03:26.290> never

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
them here before and also we've never

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.920 
them here before and also we've never
experienced<00:03:27.130> US<00:03:27.640> Nationals<00:03:28.150> and<00:03:28.299> all<00:03:28.690> I've

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
experienced US Nationals and all I've

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.140 
experienced US Nationals and all I've
heard<00:03:29.079> is<00:03:29.260> a<00:03:29.290> good<00:03:29.590> thing<00:03:29.799> so<00:03:30.069> it's<00:03:30.790> good<00:03:30.940> to<00:03:30.970> be

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
heard is a good thing so it's good to be

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.589 
heard is a good thing so it's good to be
here

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 
here

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:34.350 
here
it's<00:03:32.170> tricky<00:03:32.590> at<00:03:32.680> first<00:03:32.920> it<00:03:33.130> is<00:03:33.360> there's

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
it's tricky at first it is there's

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.550 
it's tricky at first it is there's
different<00:03:34.569> ways<00:03:34.870> that<00:03:35.110> you'll<00:03:35.260> see<00:03:35.440> people

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
different ways that you'll see people

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.009 
different ways that you'll see people
engineer<00:03:36.010> dives<00:03:36.370> either<00:03:36.760> having<00:03:37.090> people<00:03:37.390> that

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
engineer dives either having people that

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:39.930 
engineer dives either having people that
are<00:03:38.110> sit<00:03:38.410> having<00:03:38.620> crossed<00:03:39.040> arms<00:03:39.519> or<00:03:39.700> just

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
are sit having crossed arms or just

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.370 
are sit having crossed arms or just
doing<00:03:40.150> everything<00:03:40.420> backwards<00:03:40.690> so<00:03:41.079> that<00:03:41.230> you

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
doing everything backwards so that you

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.960 
doing everything backwards so that you
have<00:03:41.560> some<00:03:41.739> sort<00:03:42.040> of<00:03:42.130> have<00:03:42.280> a<00:03:42.310> visual<00:03:42.790> of<00:03:42.940> what

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
have some sort of have a visual of what

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.670 
have some sort of have a visual of what
you're<00:03:43.209> going<00:03:43.329> to<00:03:43.360> see<00:03:43.569> but<00:03:44.260> it's<00:03:44.380> impossible

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
you're going to see but it's impossible

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.100 
you're going to see but it's impossible
to<00:03:45.069> represent<00:03:45.220> what<00:03:46.150> you<00:03:46.329> will<00:03:46.510> actually<00:03:46.690> see

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
to represent what you will actually see

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.440 
to represent what you will actually see
in<00:03:47.170> the<00:03:47.290> air<00:03:47.440> when<00:03:48.190> you're<00:03:48.340> sit<00:03:48.700> and<00:03:48.940> decide

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
in the air when you're sit and decide

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:50.910 
in the air when you're sit and decide
you're<00:03:49.660> going<00:03:49.840> and<00:03:50.110> the<00:03:50.170> grips<00:03:50.380> you're<00:03:50.560> taking

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
you're going and the grips you're taking

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.069 
you're going and the grips you're taking
it's<00:03:51.610> a<00:03:51.760> little<00:03:51.910> bit<00:03:52.000> tricky<00:03:52.239> once<00:03:52.720> you<00:03:52.930> have

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:53.079 
it's a little bit tricky once you have

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:55.650 
it's a little bit tricky once you have
done<00:03:53.680> it<00:03:53.799> a<00:03:53.829> few<00:03:53.950> times<00:03:54.340> either<00:03:54.910> in<00:03:55.209> the<00:03:55.329> tunnel

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
done it a few times either in the tunnel

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.140 
done it a few times either in the tunnel
or<00:03:55.900> in<00:03:56.350> the<00:03:56.530> sky<00:03:56.829> then<00:03:57.130> you<00:03:57.489> have<00:03:57.639> a<00:03:57.670> visual

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
or in the sky then you have a visual

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.550 
or in the sky then you have a visual
picture<00:03:58.510> of<00:03:58.540> what<00:03:58.750> you're<00:03:58.989> actually<00:03:59.139> going<00:03:59.440> to

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
picture of what you're actually going to

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.470 
picture of what you're actually going to
see<00:03:59.769> and<00:03:59.950> what<00:04:00.069> it<00:04:00.190> looks<00:04:00.340> like<00:04:00.579> so<00:04:01.150> when<00:04:01.299> you

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
see and what it looks like so when you

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.289 
see and what it looks like so when you
walk<00:04:01.720> it<00:04:01.959> on<00:04:02.139> the<00:04:02.440> ground<00:04:02.680> you're<00:04:02.950> just

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
walk it on the ground you're just

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:06.330 
walk it on the ground you're just
walking<00:04:04.299> a<00:04:04.600> pace<00:04:04.840> and<00:04:05.200> once<00:04:05.859> you<00:04:05.980> get<00:04:06.130> in<00:04:06.220> the

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
walking a pace and once you get in the

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.190 
walking a pace and once you get in the
air<00:04:06.489> then<00:04:06.760> actually<00:04:07.269> you<00:04:07.420> get<00:04:07.600> the<00:04:07.780> real<00:04:07.930> grips

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
air then actually you get the real grips

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.309 
air then actually you get the real grips
that<00:04:08.290> you<00:04:08.500> can<00:04:08.650> visualize<00:04:09.160> that<00:04:10.109> it's<00:04:11.109> come

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 
that you can visualize that it's come

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:13.170 
that you can visualize that it's come
with<00:04:11.500> a<00:04:11.530> little<00:04:11.680> bit<00:04:11.769> of<00:04:11.859> experience<00:04:12.459> but<00:04:12.940> it

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
with a little bit of experience but it

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.300 
with a little bit of experience but it
is<00:04:13.329> tricky<00:04:13.600> at<00:04:13.750> first<00:04:14.019> and<00:04:14.260> it<00:04:14.709> is<00:04:14.739> confusing

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
is tricky at first and it is confusing

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.789 
is tricky at first and it is confusing
of<00:04:15.760> who<00:04:16.180> sit<00:04:16.539> who's<00:04:16.750> upside<00:04:17.109> down<00:04:17.289> what<00:04:17.560> grips

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
of who sit who's upside down what grips

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
what side wants to get that sorted out

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.170 
what side wants to get that sorted out
it's<00:04:20.590> all<00:04:20.739> fun<00:04:20.979> and<00:04:21.010> god<00:04:21.310> these<00:04:21.789> kids<00:04:22.060> are

it's all fun and god these kids are
coming<00:04:22.389> up<00:04:22.510> with<00:04:22.690> you<00:04:22.870> know<00:04:22.960> a<00:04:22.990> few<00:04:23.169> hundred

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:23.229 
coming up with you know a few hundred

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:24.480 
coming up with you know a few hundred
jumps<00:04:23.680> but<00:04:23.800> putting<00:04:23.979> this<00:04:24.100> time<00:04:24.280> in<00:04:24.400> the

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
jumps but putting this time in the

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.760 
jumps but putting this time in the
tunnel<00:04:24.820> and<00:04:25.000> that<00:04:25.539> skill<00:04:25.900> level<00:04:26.229> is<00:04:26.320> just<00:04:26.560> you

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
tunnel and that skill level is just you

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.370 
tunnel and that skill level is just you
know<00:04:26.860> learning<00:04:27.190> Kirk's<00:04:27.520> amazing<00:04:28.450> now<00:04:28.570> I<00:04:29.110> think

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
know learning Kirk's amazing now I think

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.980 
know learning Kirk's amazing now I think
that<00:04:29.770> we're<00:04:30.700> figuring<00:04:30.970> it<00:04:31.270> out<00:04:31.389> still<00:04:31.780> and

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
that we're figuring it out still and

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.710 
that we're figuring it out still and
within<00:04:32.860> the<00:04:33.039> next<00:04:33.220> three<00:04:34.060> to<00:04:34.090> four<00:04:34.389> years

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
within the next three to four years

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.089 
within the next three to four years
we're<00:04:34.840> gonna<00:04:34.930> have<00:04:35.169> that<00:04:35.289> really<00:04:35.650> dialed<00:04:35.979> so

00:04:36.089 --> 00:04:36.099 
we're gonna have that really dialed so

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:37.620 
we're gonna have that really dialed so
we<00:04:36.220> can<00:04:36.340> go<00:04:36.430> back<00:04:36.580> and<00:04:36.610> teach<00:04:36.940> these<00:04:37.210> kids<00:04:37.419> and

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
we can go back and teach these kids and

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.300 
we can go back and teach these kids and
these<00:04:37.690> up-and-comers<00:04:38.349> you<00:04:38.889> know<00:04:39.010> and<00:04:39.190> though

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
these up-and-comers you know and though

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.010 
these up-and-comers you know and though
they're<00:04:39.580> gonna<00:04:39.669> learn<00:04:40.120> very<00:04:40.419> quickly<00:04:40.720> from

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
they're gonna learn very quickly from

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.480 
they're gonna learn very quickly from
what<00:04:41.560> we're<00:04:41.680> trying<00:04:41.830> to<00:04:41.919> figure<00:04:42.099> out<00:04:42.220> right

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
what we're trying to figure out right

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.370 
what we're trying to figure out right
now<00:04:42.550> so<00:04:42.910> you'll<00:04:43.060> think<00:04:43.090> you'll<00:04:43.870> see<00:04:44.020> you<00:04:44.110> know

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
now so you'll think you'll see you know

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.469 
now so you'll think you'll see you know
there's<00:04:44.530> real<00:04:45.010> you<00:04:45.490> know<00:04:45.580> big<00:04:45.910> increase<00:04:46.450> in

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:46.479 
there's real you know big increase in

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:48.930 
there's real you know big increase in
you<00:04:47.139> know<00:04:47.229> the<00:04:48.130> point<00:04:48.430> system<00:04:48.639> that

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
you know the point system that

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.940 
you know the point system that
technicality<00:04:49.539> and<00:04:49.690> then<00:04:50.080> also<00:04:50.289> eight<00:04:50.620> way<00:04:50.830> in

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
technicality and then also eight way in

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.469 
technicality and then also eight way in
the<00:04:51.070> size<00:04:51.310> and<00:04:51.340> you<00:04:51.669> know<00:04:51.910> the<00:04:52.060> builds<00:04:52.389> that

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 
the size and you know the builds that

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:53.860 
the size and you know the builds that
were<00:04:52.570> starting<00:04:52.840> to<00:04:52.870> experiment<00:04:53.229> with

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
were starting to experiment with

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.680 
were starting to experiment with
because<00:04:54.320> of<00:04:54.470> tunnels<00:04:54.919> and<00:04:55.250> everybody<00:04:56.180> getting

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
because of tunnels and everybody getting

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.640 
because of tunnels and everybody getting
so<00:04:56.720> much<00:04:57.139> better<00:04:57.440> so<00:04:57.800> much<00:04:57.860> more<00:04:58.610> quickly<00:04:58.850> and

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
so much better so much more quickly and

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:05.050 
so much better so much more quickly and
yes<00:05:02.680> tons<00:05:03.680> of<00:05:03.979> cool<00:05:04.190> stuff<00:05:04.430> being<00:05:04.669> done<00:05:04.760> in<00:05:04.970> the

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
yes tons of cool stuff being done in the

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.010 
yes tons of cool stuff being done in the
tunnel<00:05:05.389> which<00:05:05.540> is<00:05:05.690> then<00:05:05.840> obviously

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
tunnel which is then obviously

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.689 
tunnel which is then obviously
translating<00:05:06.919> through<00:05:07.040> the<00:05:07.100> sky<00:05:07.310> and<00:05:07.580> it's

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:07.699 
translating through the sky and it's

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:10.629 
translating through the sky and it's
awesome<00:05:08.199> I<00:05:09.199> think<00:05:09.740> you'll<00:05:09.860> see<00:05:10.010> the<00:05:10.190> number<00:05:10.520> of

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:10.639 
awesome I think you'll see the number of

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:13.510 
awesome I think you'll see the number of
teams<00:05:10.910> in<00:05:11.090> four-way<00:05:11.979> skyrocket<00:05:12.979> you<00:05:13.400> know

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
teams in four-way skyrocket you know

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.310 
teams in four-way skyrocket you know
with<00:05:13.669> that<00:05:13.850> that<00:05:14.120> skill<00:05:14.479> level<00:05:14.750> and<00:05:14.900> then<00:05:15.290> I

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:15.320 
with that that skill level and then I

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:16.719 
with that that skill level and then I
think<00:05:15.590> you'll<00:05:15.740> see<00:05:15.889> eight-way<00:05:16.310> become

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:16.729 
think you'll see eight-way become

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:18.790 
think you'll see eight-way become
obviously<00:05:17.210> more<00:05:17.449> prominent<00:05:17.990> you<00:05:18.530> know<00:05:18.650> it's

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
obviously more prominent you know it's

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.520 
obviously more prominent you know it's
exciting<00:05:19.070> you<00:05:19.400> know<00:05:19.610> four<00:05:20.389> ways<00:05:20.540> fast<00:05:20.840> and<00:05:21.169> if

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
exciting you know four ways fast and if

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.170 
exciting you know four ways fast and if
we<00:05:21.650> can<00:05:21.770> get<00:05:21.889> eight<00:05:22.100> way<00:05:22.280> to<00:05:22.340> that<00:05:22.610> where<00:05:23.060> it's

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 
we can get eight way to that where it's

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.820 
we can get eight way to that where it's
really<00:05:23.600> dynamic<00:05:23.840> in<00:05:24.260> you're<00:05:24.350> seeing<00:05:24.500> large

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830 
really dynamic in you're seeing large

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.830 
really dynamic in you're seeing large
pieces<00:05:25.220> move<00:05:25.669> and<00:05:26.000> you<00:05:26.180> know<00:05:26.300> obviously<00:05:26.690> we're

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 
pieces move and you know obviously we're

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.320 
pieces move and you know obviously we're
flipping<00:05:27.050> these<00:05:27.320> things<00:05:27.620> it's<00:05:28.430> it's<00:05:28.729> exciting

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
flipping these things it's it's exciting

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.950 
flipping these things it's it's exciting
to<00:05:29.419> watch

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
to watch

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.379 
to watch
it's<00:05:30.260> very<00:05:30.530> three-dimensional<00:05:30.940> I'm<00:05:31.940> not<00:05:32.150> like

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:32.389 
it's very three-dimensional I'm not like

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:33.460 
it's very three-dimensional I'm not like
you<00:05:32.540> know<00:05:32.630> you're<00:05:32.780> not<00:05:32.840> just<00:05:33.080> watching<00:05:33.229> this

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:33.470 
you know you're not just watching this

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:35.290 
you know you're not just watching this
you're<00:05:33.680> watching<00:05:33.860> things<00:05:34.340> move<00:05:34.639> around<00:05:34.850> and

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.300 
you're watching things move around and

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.480 
you're watching things move around and
over<00:05:35.540> and<00:05:35.810> under<00:05:35.900> and<00:05:36.229> all<00:05:36.800> that<00:05:36.979> stuff<00:05:37.220> so<00:05:37.250> I

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
over and under and all that stuff so I

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.730 
over and under and all that stuff so I
think<00:05:38.030> it's<00:05:38.150> you<00:05:38.720> know<00:05:38.810> the<00:05:38.990> goal<00:05:39.200> and<00:05:39.380> it's

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:39.740 
think it's you know the goal and it's

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:46.039 
think it's you know the goal and it's
it's<00:05:40.040> close

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:46.049 

00:05:46.049 --> 00:05:50.309 

down<00:05:47.049> with<00:05:47.289> me<00:05:47.409> gonna<00:05:47.619> make<00:05:47.889> you<00:05:48.069> free
