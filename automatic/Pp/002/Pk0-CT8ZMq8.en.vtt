00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.420
 very good and welcome one more day today 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:16.880
 let's see chronology is a game 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:20.029
 independent that mixes adventures 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.680
 with touches of plataformeo and puzzles well 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.169
 that's good here we see our character 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.089
 of sitting in this mechanism and we're going to 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:28.429
 choose a chapter then the second 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:31.250
 chapter to not start with the by the 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:33.950
 beginning of the game 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.080
 good chapter 2 iron structures 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.760
 to get a little in situation I'm going to 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.790
 explain what happens what 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.610
 events that happen in this case 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.650
 Well, because of the steam industry 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.270
 because the world just because they have 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.520
 practically finished the resources of the 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.470
 land so it has led to a 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.720
 kind of holocaust this other 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.960
 character that wakes up then once 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.610
 everything we say has vanished everything is 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.190
 practically abandoned and I do not know 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.260
 wakes up alone but finds a 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.170
 luck of magic clock this with this 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.880
 clock what allows us is so much 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.590
 in front as to go forward as backwards in 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.240
 time and this is one of the 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.390
 basic principles of the juvenility of 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.430
 good chronology with the b key in this 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.289
 case is the game for pc but it is 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.710
 compatible controller equipment 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:23.780
 360 with the b key, if you look 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.760
 we can go back and forth 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.979
 in time, what is it for? 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.869
 well depending on what time we 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.960
 we find there will be structures that 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:35.570
 find demolished or not so so 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.460
 we can go through them or 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.280
 directly because they will not exist and not 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.840
 we can use it good here as 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.729
 basic concept first thing we have 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.340
 to keep in mind so this is what 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.649
 you're going to see a lot a lot along the 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.560
 video and we will be switching between 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:52.940
 let's say in different times 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.789
 well here if we see up to the 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:58.700
 right puts us by after or if what 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:02.630
 we found in the one before the holocaust 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.280
 or later so we already see something by 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.640
 what we could anticipate as you see 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.860
 here we have this as this trunk and 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.080
 as we are practically as if it were 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.840
 in the past, what we can do 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.630
 is to leave here this trunk we go to 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.150
 future and will have grown so 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.050
 we can can use it to 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.180
 circumvent that space 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.030
 The good thing about it is that good with it 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.130
 if we consider this factor because it 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.440
 gives one gives you enough fun and about 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.200
 all imagination when facing 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.790
 the different puzzles and the different ones 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.150
 scenarios that we have throughout the 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.150
 product 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.970
 behaves to power in zip 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.180
 first it may be a little bit a bit 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.580
 difficult the theme of going all the time 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.920
 changing between eras but I have to 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.690
 take 15-20 minutes playing the 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.090
 truth that already go you are going to know more or 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.830
 less where do you have to change or where 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.330
 you think a change is going to be made 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.330
 about on the map 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:24.950
 get rid of sororities of settings 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.459
 machinery 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.459
 already 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.910
 all right 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.330
 for more 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.180
 but we have already fixed the 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.040
 gear so now in the time 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.160
 before the holocaust, we can already 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:57.090
 activate this mechanism that helps us 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:01.370
 pass the new king 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.370
 but that timer place for everything 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.280
 Thank you 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:21.919
 A) Yes 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.940
 jana 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.479
 and they have 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:11.970
 but strauss kahn in the ring more inri 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:11.970
 life my way my way the hole 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.169
 will see 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.680
 do not 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:43.199
 Well, so it seems this man 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.030
 He is not willing to help us like this 

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:47.190
 that we're going to have to engineer that link 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:49.410
 using this magic clock we have 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:52.199
 to make arrive so if we 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:55.560
 we come here to observe that the smoke 

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:57.150
 annoying so we already reduce that if it's 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.380
 being bothered by smoke because no no 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.380
 It will not bother us too much 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:13.259
 do not 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.900
 the 

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.840
 and 

00:06:45.089 --> 00:06:51.179
 trailers out my way with more purpose 

00:06:48.309 --> 00:06:51.179
 distraction 

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:04.289
 and well, this has been a small 

00:07:02.069 --> 00:07:06.300
 sample of krahnology as you see a game 

00:07:04.289 --> 00:07:08.340
 very funny that has come out of the 

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.720
 platform this ingrid light and that 

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:11.699
 besides, it gives us a lot 

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:13.949
 possibilities since mixing was that 

00:07:11.699 --> 00:07:16.560
 part of adventure platforms and some 

00:07:13.949 --> 00:07:19.229
 puzzles add the extra that we have 

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:21.419
 Well, that kind of magic clock that 

00:07:19.229 --> 00:07:23.729
 allows us to alternate between the future and 

00:07:21.419 --> 00:07:25.770
 the past to change then the variety 

00:07:23.729 --> 00:07:27.210
 of the map makes nothing can be but 

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:29.780
 that you liked it and see you the 

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:29.780
 next video
