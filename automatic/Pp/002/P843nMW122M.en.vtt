00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260 
under the color so you've really got to

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.870 
under the color so you've really got to
work<00:02:03.470> with<00:02:03.650> it<00:02:03.860> to<00:02:03.890> get<00:02:04.160> right<00:02:04.460> there<00:02:04.670> in<00:02:04.820> that

medium<00:02:05.390> to<00:02:05.420> know<00:02:05.990> how<00:02:06.740> much<00:02:06.950> is<00:02:07.280> enough<00:02:08.200> so<00:02:09.200> I

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
medium to know how much is enough so I

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.320 
medium to know how much is enough so I
struggled<00:02:10.399> with<00:02:10.490> that<00:02:10.610> for<00:02:10.670> a<00:02:10.910> while

my<00:02:29.870> opinion<00:02:30.020> as<00:02:30.890> far<00:02:31.250> as<00:02:31.340> plumpers<00:02:31.790> go<00:02:31.970> a<00:02:32.330> lot

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
my opinion as far as plumpers go a lot

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.900 
my opinion as far as plumpers go a lot
of<00:02:32.660> people<00:02:32.840> when<00:02:33.200> they<00:02:33.350> say<00:02:33.680> that<00:02:34.489> a<00:02:34.550> plumper

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
of people when they say that a plumper

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.960 
of people when they say that a plumper
doesn't<00:02:35.239> work<00:02:36.250> when<00:02:37.250> they<00:02:37.370> have<00:02:37.700> lips<00:02:38.360> already

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
doesn't work when they have lips already

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.930 
doesn't work when they have lips already
you<00:02:40.970> know<00:02:41.120> just<00:02:42.010> maybe<00:02:43.010> it<00:02:43.220> doesn't<00:02:43.459> plump<00:02:43.790> for

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
you know just maybe it doesn't plump for

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.850 
you know just maybe it doesn't plump for
them<00:02:44.090> because<00:02:44.269> they<00:02:44.570> they<00:02:44.959> already<00:02:45.560> have

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
them because they they already have

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.110 
them because they they already have
lists<00:02:46.130> they're<00:02:46.310> not<00:02:46.430> going<00:02:46.580> to<00:02:46.610> see<00:02:46.760> much<00:02:46.910> of<00:02:46.940> a

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
lists they're not going to see much of a

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.680 
lists they're not going to see much of a
difference

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
difference

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.600 
difference
therefore<00:02:48.500> for<00:02:48.920> somebody<00:02:49.190> like<00:02:49.370> me<00:02:49.580> that

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
therefore for somebody like me that

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.850 
therefore for somebody like me that
doesn't<00:02:49.940> have<00:02:50.300> lips<00:02:50.600> a<00:02:50.870> plumper<00:02:51.590> that

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
doesn't have lips a plumper that

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.410 
doesn't have lips a plumper that
generally<00:02:52.580> would<00:02:52.700> not<00:02:52.760> work<00:02:53.030> for<00:02:53.060> someone

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
generally would not work for someone

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.350 
generally would not work for someone
else<00:02:53.600> may<00:02:54.320> work<00:02:54.620> for<00:02:54.800> me<00:02:54.920> a<00:02:54.950> little<00:02:55.580> bit<00:02:55.760> enough

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
else may work for me a little bit enough

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.699 
else may work for me a little bit enough
to<00:02:57.070> you<00:02:58.070> know<00:02:58.930> make<00:02:59.930> my<00:03:00.140> lips<00:03:00.410> a<00:03:00.500> little<00:03:00.590> bit

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
to you know make my lips a little bit

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.520 
to you know make my lips a little bit
more<00:03:00.920> apparent<00:03:01.160> or<00:03:01.550> at<00:03:01.880> least<00:03:02.330> I<00:03:02.780> have<00:03:03.170> noticed

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
more apparent or at least I have noticed

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.650 
more apparent or at least I have noticed
in<00:03:03.830> doing<00:03:04.400> a<00:03:04.519> little<00:03:04.790> bit<00:03:05.060> I<00:03:05.090> haven't<00:03:05.450> done<00:03:05.600> a

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
in doing a little bit I haven't done a

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.020 
in doing a little bit I haven't done a
lot<00:03:05.989> of<00:03:06.019> research<00:03:06.260> on<00:03:06.620> plumpers<00:03:07.040> but<00:03:07.670> in<00:03:07.790> doing

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
lot of research on plumpers but in doing

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.729 
lot of research on plumpers but in doing
a<00:03:08.120> little<00:03:08.360> bit<00:03:08.540> of<00:03:08.630> research<00:03:08.930> on<00:03:09.140> plumber's<00:03:09.530> I

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
a little bit of research on plumber's I

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:12.310 
a little bit of research on plumber's I
have<00:03:09.920> noticed<00:03:10.280> that<00:03:10.489> what<00:03:10.700> their<00:03:11.330> major<00:03:11.930> claim

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
have noticed that what their major claim

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.640 
have noticed that what their major claim
is<00:03:12.680> is<00:03:12.980> to<00:03:13.280> reduce<00:03:13.760> the<00:03:14.600> fine<00:03:14.930> lines<00:03:15.260> in<00:03:15.530> your

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
is is to reduce the fine lines in your

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.790 
is is to reduce the fine lines in your
lips<00:03:16.390> so<00:03:17.390> I<00:03:17.840> think<00:03:17.959> a<00:03:18.200> lot<00:03:18.320> of<00:03:18.380> people<00:03:18.650> have<00:03:18.769> a

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
lips so I think a lot of people have a

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.360 
lips so I think a lot of people have a
misconception<00:03:19.040> of<00:03:19.670> plumpers<00:03:20.090> as<00:03:20.300> far<00:03:20.570> as<00:03:21.370> they

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
misconception of plumpers as far as they

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:23.920 
misconception of plumpers as far as they
think<00:03:22.640> that<00:03:22.790> they're<00:03:22.940> going<00:03:23.060> to<00:03:23.150> get<00:03:23.269> more

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
think that they're going to get more

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.650 
think that they're going to get more
volume<00:03:24.170> in<00:03:24.590> their<00:03:24.950> lips<00:03:25.220> and<00:03:25.489> I<00:03:26.269> think<00:03:26.540> what

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
volume in their lips and I think what

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.210 
volume in their lips and I think what
the<00:03:26.750> product<00:03:27.110> is<00:03:27.230> actually<00:03:27.410> claiming<00:03:27.860> to<00:03:28.070> do

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
the product is actually claiming to do

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.680 
the product is actually claiming to do
is<00:03:28.430> reduce<00:03:28.639> fine<00:03:29.030> lines

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
is reduce fine lines

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.900 
is reduce fine lines
this<00:03:30.230> did<00:03:30.470> not<00:03:30.620> even<00:03:30.800> reduce<00:03:31.190> the<00:03:31.220> lines<00:03:31.580> of<00:03:31.820> my

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
this did not even reduce the lines of my

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:37.570 
this did not even reduce the lines of my
list<00:03:33.400> so<00:03:34.400> as<00:03:34.640> far<00:03:34.850> as<00:03:34.970> a<00:03:35.000> plumper<00:03:35.390> no<00:03:36.430> not<00:03:37.430> at

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
list so as far as a plumper no not at

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.470 
list so as far as a plumper no not at
all<00:03:37.730> I<00:03:38.000> was<00:03:39.070> not<00:03:40.070> very<00:03:40.220> happy<00:03:40.340> I<00:03:40.790> don't

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
all I was not very happy I don't

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:42.820 
all I was not very happy I don't
remember<00:03:41.720> how<00:03:41.960> much<00:03:42.080> I<00:03:42.200> paid<00:03:42.230> for<00:03:42.440> this<00:03:42.680> I

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
remember how much I paid for this I

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.320 
remember how much I paid for this I
think<00:03:43.010> I<00:03:43.100> paid<00:03:43.280> like<00:03:43.490> five<00:03:43.760> or<00:03:43.940> six<00:03:44.150> dollars

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
think I paid like five or six dollars

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.590 
think I paid like five or six dollars

for it at CVS you would have to look

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.310
