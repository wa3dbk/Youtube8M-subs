poly<00:01:44.130> elastomer<00:01:44.790> where<00:01:45.090> if<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.899> when<00:01:46.799> energy

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
poly elastomer where if the when energy

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.910 
poly elastomer where if the when energy
hits<00:01:47.399> it<00:01:47.579> it<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:48.119> molecules<00:01:48.659> tighten<00:01:48.990> up<00:01:49.079> and

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
hits it it the molecules tighten up and

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.859 
hits it it the molecules tighten up and
really<00:01:50.399> absorbs<00:01:50.759> all<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.329> energy<00:01:51.659> that's

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
really absorbs all the energy that's

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.319 
really absorbs all the energy that's
required<00:01:52.140> for<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.710> seee<00:01:52.860> standard<00:01:53.399> but<00:01:54.210> we

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
required for the seee standard but we

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.520 
required for the seee standard but we
get<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.540> use<00:01:54.659> something<00:01:54.930> that's<00:01:54.990> about<00:01:55.170> 1/3<00:01:55.500> of

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
get to use something that's about 1/3 of

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.929 
get to use something that's about 1/3 of
the<00:01:55.680> thickness<00:01:55.860> of<00:01:56.070> traditional<00:01:56.700> poly

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
the thickness of traditional poly

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.730 
the thickness of traditional poly
urethanes<00:01:57.390> so<00:01:57.600> it's<00:01:57.719> real<00:01:57.960> flexible<00:01:58.500> real

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
urethanes so it's real flexible real

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.200 
urethanes so it's real flexible real
comfortable<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.280> wear<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.729> nice<00:01:59.880> part<00:02:00.119> is

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
comfortable to wear and the nice part is

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.760 
comfortable to wear and the nice part is
I'm<00:02:00.360> sitting<00:02:00.540> here<00:02:00.780> I<00:02:00.810> can't<00:02:01.110> even<00:02:01.200> tell<00:02:01.619> it's

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
I'm sitting here I can't even tell it's

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.160 
I'm sitting here I can't even tell it's
in<00:02:01.950> here<00:02:02.189> at<00:02:02.280> all<00:02:02.840> comfortable<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:03.990> that's

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
in here at all comfortable and that's

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.080 
in here at all comfortable and that's
exactly<00:02:04.500> right<00:02:04.710> it<00:02:05.189> really<00:02:05.280> allows<00:02:05.670> us<00:02:05.700> to

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
exactly right it really allows us to

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.270 
exactly right it really allows us to
really<00:02:06.810> hone<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.170> fit<00:02:07.350> of<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.500> jacket<00:02:07.680> too<00:02:08.039> so

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
really hone the fit of the jacket too so

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.219 
really hone the fit of the jacket too so
again<00:02:08.489> it<00:02:08.729> really<00:02:08.970> enhances<00:02:09.479> that<00:02:09.660> dynamic

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
again it really enhances that dynamic

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.830 
again it really enhances that dynamic
capability<00:02:10.830> of<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:10.979> jacket<00:02:11.370> this<00:02:12.120> is<00:02:12.330> a<00:02:12.360> I'll

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
capability of the jacket this is a I'll

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.430 
capability of the jacket this is a I'll
have<00:02:12.959> you<00:02:13.050> spin

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
have you spin

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.140 
have you spin
out<00:02:13.530> here<00:02:13.710> a<00:02:13.740> little<00:02:13.890> bit<00:02:14.070> you<00:02:14.670> can<00:02:14.850> sort<00:02:15.090> of

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
out here a little bit you can sort of

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.850 
out here a little bit you can sort of
see<00:02:15.360> our<00:02:15.570> rear<00:02:15.780> venting<00:02:16.140> on<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.350> back<00:02:16.530> and

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
see our rear venting on the back and

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.530 
see our rear venting on the back and
more<00:02:17.280> of<00:02:17.370> that<00:02:17.460> elastic<00:02:17.700> panel<00:02:18.210> there<00:02:18.360> and

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
more of that elastic panel there and

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.060 
more of that elastic panel there and
that<00:02:18.960> one<00:02:19.140> feature<00:02:19.380> that<00:02:19.530> I<00:02:19.740> really<00:02:19.800> like

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
that one feature that I really like

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.480 
that one feature that I really like
which<00:02:20.520> is<00:02:21.060> our<00:02:21.360> built-in<00:02:21.780> rain<00:02:22.020> hood<00:02:22.490> maybe

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
which is our built-in rain hood maybe

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:24.590 
which is our built-in rain hood maybe
I'll<00:02:23.640> put<00:02:23.820> it<00:02:23.880> on<00:02:23.970> here<00:02:24.150> if<00:02:24.210> you're<00:02:24.330> all<00:02:24.450> right

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
I'll put it on here if you're all right

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.160 
I'll put it on here if you're all right
yeah<00:02:25.610> this<00:02:26.610> is<00:02:26.910> something<00:02:27.600> that<00:02:27.780> you<00:02:28.050> just

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
yeah this is something that you just

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.080 
yeah this is something that you just
come<00:02:28.440> to<00:02:28.590> love<00:02:28.770> when<00:02:28.950> you<00:02:29.040> need<00:02:29.190> it<00:02:29.340> this<00:02:29.880> is<00:02:30.060> a

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
come to love when you need it this is a

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.690 
come to love when you need it this is a
stretch<00:02:30.450> mesh<00:02:30.750> fully<00:02:31.230> breathable<00:02:31.740> you<00:02:32.430> put<00:02:32.610> it

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
stretch mesh fully breathable you put it

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:33.020 
stretch mesh fully breathable you put it
on

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
on

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.170 
on
oh<00:02:33.720> sorry<00:02:34.050> hoping<00:02:34.440> to<00:02:34.500> strangle<00:02:34.950> me<00:02:35.010> there<00:02:35.190> and

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
oh sorry hoping to strangle me there and

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.180 
oh sorry hoping to strangle me there and
then<00:02:36.750> in<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:36.990> backside<00:02:37.410> it's<00:02:37.680> all<00:02:37.830> waterproof

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
then in the backside it's all waterproof

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.070 
then in the backside it's all waterproof
so<00:02:38.610> when<00:02:38.880> you<00:02:38.940> put<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.180> helmet<00:02:39.450> back<00:02:39.570> on<00:02:39.780> water

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
so when you put the helmet back on water

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.720 
so when you put the helmet back on water
rolls<00:02:40.470> down<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:40.710> back<00:02:41.010> and<00:02:41.250> that's<00:02:41.340> on<00:02:41.580> the

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
rolls down the back and that's on the

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.250 
rolls down the back and that's on the
inside<00:02:42.000> not<00:02:42.330> in<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.630> inside<00:02:42.900> of<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.050> jacket

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
inside not in the inside of the jacket

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.840 
inside not in the inside of the jacket
and<00:02:43.650> because<00:02:43.950> wearing<00:02:44.220> a<00:02:44.340> helmet<00:02:44.490> you<00:02:44.670> don't

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
and because wearing a helmet you don't

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.030 
and because wearing a helmet you don't
look<00:02:44.940> ridiculous<00:02:45.300> -<00:02:45.660> exactly<00:02:46.170> exactly<00:02:46.440> yeah

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
look ridiculous - exactly exactly yeah

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.820 
look ridiculous - exactly exactly yeah
you<00:02:47.220> get<00:02:47.400> that<00:02:47.490> sort<00:02:47.730> of<00:02:47.820> monk<00:02:48.090> thing<00:02:48.360> going<00:02:48.660> on

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
you get that sort of monk thing going on

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.110 
you get that sort of monk thing going on
one<00:02:49.830> other<00:02:49.920> feature<00:02:50.190> that<00:02:50.340> we<00:02:50.430> do<00:02:50.580> here<00:02:50.790> was<00:02:50.970> we

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
one other feature that we do here was we

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.960 
one other feature that we do here was we
do<00:02:51.240> a<00:02:51.270> sliding<00:02:51.690> snap<00:02:52.050> collar<00:02:52.640> this<00:02:53.640> gives<00:02:53.880> you

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
do a sliding snap collar this gives you

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.610 
do a sliding snap collar this gives you
allow<00:02:54.210> and<00:02:54.540> this<00:02:54.690> allows<00:02:54.930> you<00:02:55.110> to<00:02:55.200> have<00:02:55.350> full

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
allow and this allows you to have full

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.650 
allow and this allows you to have full
adjustability<00:02:56.130> if<00:02:56.520> you're<00:02:57.240> wearing<00:02:57.390> a<00:02:57.510> neck

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
adjustability if you're wearing a neck

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.120 
adjustability if you're wearing a neck
gaiter<00:02:57.930> or<00:02:58.170> some<00:02:58.380> kind<00:02:58.620> of<00:02:58.650> warmth<00:02:58.920> later

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
gaiter or some kind of warmth later

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.130 
gaiter or some kind of warmth later
underneath<00:02:59.550> you<00:02:59.760> can<00:02:59.940> open<00:03:00.600> the<00:03:00.690> collar<00:03:00.900> up<00:03:01.050> a

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
underneath you can open the collar up a

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.330 
underneath you can open the collar up a
little<00:03:01.290> bit<00:03:01.410> or<00:03:01.500> you<00:03:01.590> can<00:03:01.710> close<00:03:01.890> it<00:03:02.100> up<00:03:02.190> and

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
little bit or you can close it up and

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.130 
little bit or you can close it up and
you<00:03:02.460> still<00:03:02.700> just<00:03:02.940> have<00:03:03.090> that<00:03:03.270> one<00:03:03.300> snap<00:03:03.930> that

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
you still just have that one snap that

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.930 
you still just have that one snap that
you<00:03:04.230> have<00:03:04.320> to<00:03:04.410> contend<00:03:04.710> with<00:03:04.770> perfect<00:03:05.430> as<00:03:05.670> far

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
you have to contend with perfect as far

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.120 
you have to contend with perfect as far
as<00:03:05.970> reflectivity<00:03:06.870> and<00:03:07.200> insulation<00:03:07.800> we<00:03:08.010> have

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
as reflectivity and insulation we have

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.460 
as reflectivity and insulation we have
reflectivity<00:03:09.060> you<00:03:09.390> can<00:03:09.540> see<00:03:09.720> some<00:03:09.930> the<00:03:10.110> piping

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
reflectivity you can see some the piping

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.440 
reflectivity you can see some the piping
right<00:03:10.590> here<00:03:10.920> it's<00:03:11.460> subtle<00:03:11.790> but<00:03:11.970> very<00:03:12.300> very

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
right here it's subtle but very very
