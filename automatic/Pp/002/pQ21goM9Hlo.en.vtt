thing<00:04:48.140> using<00:04:49.140> the<00:04:49.350> internet<00:04:49.800> at<00:04:50.430> a<00:04:50.850> human

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
thing using the internet at a human

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.620 
thing using the internet at a human
scale<00:04:51.540> and<00:04:51.860> you<00:04:52.860> know<00:04:53.100> in<00:04:53.370> its<00:04:53.640> it<00:04:54.000> works<00:04:54.300> it's

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
scale and you know in its it works it's

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.500 
scale and you know in its it works it's
great<00:04:54.960> we<00:04:55.200> go<00:04:55.350> direct<00:04:55.680> to<00:04:55.740> our<00:04:55.890> audience<00:04:56.510> and
