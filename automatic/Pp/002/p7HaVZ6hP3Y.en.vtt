00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.590 
download at the same time which is weird
because<00:02:01.890> just<00:02:02.310> every<00:02:02.549> raw<00:02:02.729> file<00:02:02.970> is<00:02:03.150> on<00:02:03.299> here

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
because just every raw file is on here

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.940 
because just every raw file is on here
but<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.049> system<00:02:04.350> can<00:02:04.500> actually<00:02:04.619> take<00:02:04.920> that

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.399 
but the system can actually take that

material and as you're as it as it shows
it<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.680> you<00:02:07.799> give<00:02:08.640> you<00:02:09.170> previews<00:02:10.170> or

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
it to you give you previews or

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.130 
it to you give you previews or

it<00:02:26.010> actually<00:02:26.310> makes<00:02:26.520> it<00:02:26.640> for<00:02:26.850> you<00:02:26.880> so<00:02:27.150> it<00:02:27.300> not

only<00:02:27.870> is<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.319> VFS<00:02:28.710> giving<00:02:29.550> you<00:02:29.640> access<00:02:29.880> to<00:02:30.209> the

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
only is the VFS giving you access to the

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.000 
only is the VFS giving you access to the
data<00:02:30.390> on<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:30.810> drive<00:02:30.930> but<00:02:31.290> also<00:02:31.440> it<00:02:31.709> allows<00:02:31.830> you

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
data on the drive but also it allows you

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.650 
data on the drive but also it allows you
to<00:02:32.100> create<00:02:32.430> other<00:02:32.610> versions<00:02:33.420> of<00:02:33.540> the

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660

to create other versions of the
compression<00:02:33.990> as<00:02:34.260> you<00:02:34.740> go<00:02:34.920> so<00:02:35.220> very<00:02:35.819> cool

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
compression as you go so very cool

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.670 
compression as you go so very cool
that's<00:02:36.330> what<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:36.510> VFS<00:02:36.900> really<00:02:37.200> does<00:02:37.410> but

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
that's what the VFS really does but

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.870 
that's what the VFS really does but
let's<00:02:37.740> go<00:02:37.890> check<00:02:38.069> it<00:02:38.190> out<00:02:38.280> to<00:02:38.730> see<00:02:38.760> what

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
let's go check it out to see what

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.770 
let's go check it out to see what
exactly<00:02:39.120> what<00:02:39.390> I<00:02:39.420> mean<00:02:39.690> on<00:02:39.870> my<00:02:39.959> computer

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
exactly what I mean on my computer

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.410 
have the codex magazine with some ProRes
content<00:02:47.340> on<00:02:47.459> it<00:02:47.640> so<00:02:47.760> it's<00:02:47.880> just<00:02:47.940> a<00:02:48.150> couple

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.910 
you know if you're used to seeing sys
cards<00:03:17.550> just<00:03:17.840> Alexa<00:03:18.840> cards<00:03:19.140> you'd<00:03:19.620> see<00:03:19.769> this

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
cards just Alexa cards you'd see this

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.430 
cards just Alexa cards you'd see this
before<00:03:20.269> there<00:03:21.269> you<00:03:21.360> go<00:03:21.540> and<00:03:21.840> inside<00:03:22.230> there<00:03:22.410> are

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
before there you go and inside there are

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.860 
before there you go and inside there are
some<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:22.920> two<00:03:23.070> ProRes<00:03:23.430> clips<00:03:23.720> except<00:03:24.720> you're

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
some the two ProRes clips except you're

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.860 
some the two ProRes clips except you're
playing<00:03:25.110> like<00:03:25.470> normal<00:03:26.010> so<00:03:26.360> this<00:03:27.360> is<00:03:27.510> normal

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
playing like normal so this is normal

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.120 
playing like normal so this is normal
this<00:03:27.930> is<00:03:28.080> how<00:03:28.230> it<00:03:28.380> works<00:03:28.590> with<00:03:28.709> the<00:03:28.830> pro<00:03:28.950> res

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
this is how it works with the pro res

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.610 
this is how it works with the pro res
clips<00:03:29.400> nothing<00:03:30.239> really<00:03:30.480> big<00:03:30.900> needed<00:03:31.380> you<00:03:31.500> do

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
clips nothing really big needed you do

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.729 
clips nothing really big needed you do
need<00:03:31.829> some<00:03:32.600> drivers<00:03:33.600> and<00:03:33.870> etc<00:03:34.140> installed

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
need some drivers and etc installed

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.319 
need some drivers and etc installed
which<00:03:34.950> is<00:03:35.070> all<00:03:35.130> available<00:03:35.310> for<00:03:35.640> download<00:03:36.150> and

actually<00:05:10.650> see<00:05:10.950> the<00:05:11.070> metadata<00:05:11.370> the<00:05:11.580> clip<00:05:11.790> and

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
actually see the metadata the clip and

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.330 
actually see the metadata the clip and
edit<00:05:12.180> it<00:05:12.270> even<00:05:12.540> so<00:05:12.990> really<00:05:13.710> cool<00:05:13.920> it's<00:05:14.070> got<00:05:14.190> all

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
edit it even so really cool it's got all

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.390 
edit it even so really cool it's got all
kind<00:05:14.550> of<00:05:14.610> stuff<00:05:14.790> going<00:05:14.820> on<00:05:15.120> here<00:05:15.800> but<00:05:16.800> it<00:05:17.010> there

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
kind of stuff going on here but it there

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.210 
kind of stuff going on here but it there
it<00:05:17.520> goes<00:05:17.670> it's<00:05:17.910> working<00:05:18.270> well<00:05:18.510> so<00:05:19.050> but<00:05:19.860> beyond

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:20.220 
it goes it's working well so but beyond

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.650 
it goes it's working well so but beyond
that<00:05:20.460> that's<00:05:20.640> the<00:05:20.850> clips<00:05:21.030> that<00:05:21.090> I<00:05:21.210> have<00:05:21.360> in<00:05:21.540> my

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 
that that's the clips that I have in my

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.930 
that that's the clips that I have in my
raw<00:05:21.870> viewer<00:05:22.200> but<00:05:22.440> I<00:05:22.590> cannot<00:05:23.010> actually<00:05:23.220> go<00:05:23.520> into

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
raw viewer but I cannot actually go into

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.910 
raw viewer but I cannot actually go into
the<00:05:24.060> VFS<00:05:24.540> configuration<00:05:25.260> because<00:05:25.560> I<00:05:25.590> had<00:05:25.800> the

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:25.920 
the VFS configuration because I had the

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.180 
the VFS configuration because I had the

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220 
up here go in a VFS and now I have the I

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.250 
up here go in a VFS and now I have the I
can<00:05:35.400> see<00:05:35.550> where<00:05:35.700> I<00:05:35.760> have<00:05:35.910> my<00:05:36.060> a<00:05:36.090> RI<00:05:36.450> system<00:05:37.050> and

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:37.260 
can see where I have my a RI system and

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.010 
can see where I have my a RI system and
beyond<00:05:37.950> that<00:05:38.010> I<00:05:38.130> can<00:05:38.310> add<00:05:38.460> some<00:05:39.240> more<00:05:39.270> outputs

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
beyond that I can add some more outputs

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.650 
beyond that I can add some more outputs
right<00:05:40.260> so<00:05:40.530> I<00:05:40.770> have<00:05:41.310> closed<00:05:42.030> this<00:05:42.180> up<00:05:42.360> so<00:05:42.450> we<00:05:42.480> can

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:42.660 
right so I have closed this up so we can

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.750 
right so I have closed this up so we can
see<00:05:42.870> it<00:05:42.960> I<00:05:43.140> have<00:05:43.650> a<00:05:43.680> RI<00:05:44.070> there<00:05:44.370> I<00:05:44.400> want<00:05:44.700> it

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:44.760 
see it I have a RI there I want it

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.760 
see it I have a RI there I want it
instead<00:05:45.180> now<00:05:45.480> also<00:05:45.810> add<00:05:46.520> MOV<00:05:47.520> as<00:05:47.940> a<00:05:48.000> file<00:05:48.330> type

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:48.770 
instead now also add MOV as a file type

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.670

play now how did I get these files well
they're<00:06:17.430> not<00:06:17.490> really<00:06:17.730> there<00:06:18.060> the<00:06:18.270> raw<00:06:18.660> file<00:06:18.960> is

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:19.200 
they're not really there the raw file is

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.900 
they're not really there the raw file is
there<00:06:19.410> and<00:06:19.650> the<00:06:19.740> the<00:06:20.040> system<00:06:20.430> here<00:06:20.610> is<00:06:20.700> sort<00:06:20.820> of

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:20.910 
there and the the system here is sort of

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:23.360 
there and the the system here is sort of
generating<00:06:21.690> these<00:06:21.810> this<00:06:22.410> views<00:06:22.860> of<00:06:23.070> that<00:06:23.220> raw

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:23.370 
generating these this views of that raw

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:26.360 
generating these this views of that raw
material<00:06:23.970> ok<00:06:24.450> that<00:06:24.630> sounds<00:06:24.870> cool<00:06:25.050> but<00:06:25.860> it's

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.370 
material ok that sounds cool but it's

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:27.770 
material ok that sounds cool but it's
not<00:06:26.430> really<00:06:26.760> there<00:06:26.880> until<00:06:27.120> actually<00:06:27.420> copy

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:27.780 
not really there until actually copy

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.350 
not really there until actually copy
that<00:06:28.110> material<00:06:28.620> off<00:06:28.800> right<00:06:29.220> so<00:06:29.250> at<00:06:30.000> this<00:06:30.150> point

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360 
that material off right so at this point

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.490 
that material off right so at this point
though<00:06:30.540> I<00:06:30.570> could<00:06:30.780> just<00:06:30.900> start<00:06:31.050> copying<00:06:31.410> the

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:31.500 
though I could just start copying the

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.020 
though I could just start copying the
material<00:06:31.860> off<00:06:31.980> using<00:06:32.370> a<00:06:32.430> tool<00:06:32.640> or<00:06:32.670> just

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:33.030 
material off using a tool or just

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.060 
material off using a tool or just
drag-and-drop<00:06:33.360> even<00:06:33.960> and<00:06:34.650> it<00:06:34.800> would<00:06:34.890> start

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:35.070 
drag-and-drop even and it would start

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:36.980 
drag-and-drop even and it would start
actually<00:06:35.280> making<00:06:35.490> these<00:06:35.850> versions<00:06:36.330> for<00:06:36.720> me<00:06:36.810> so

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:36.990 
actually making these versions for me so

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:38.720 
actually making these versions for me so
the<00:06:37.500> codec<00:06:37.800> system<00:06:38.070> is<00:06:38.160> not<00:06:38.310> only<00:06:38.490> a

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:38.730 
the codec system is not only a

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:40.700 
the codec system is not only a
downloading<00:06:39.450> tool<00:06:39.600> it's<00:06:39.780> also<00:06:39.900> generating

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:40.710 
downloading tool it's also generating

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:42.920 
downloading tool it's also generating
sort<00:06:41.190> of<00:06:41.250> dailies<00:06:41.700> or<00:06:41.880> proxies<00:06:42.300> for<00:06:42.510> me<00:06:42.690> at<00:06:42.810> the

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:42.930 
sort of dailies or proxies for me at the

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:46.430 
sort of dailies or proxies for me at the
same<00:06:43.110> time<00:06:43.410> pretty<00:06:43.950> cool<00:06:44.310> so<00:06:45.300> that's<00:06:46.050> that<00:06:46.260> but

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:46.440 
same time pretty cool so that's that but

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:47.570 
same time pretty cool so that's that but
let's<00:06:46.620> say<00:06:46.740> I<00:06:46.770> want<00:06:47.010> to<00:06:47.040> add<00:06:47.100> some<00:06:47.370> more<00:06:47.490> stuff

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:47.580 
let's say I want to add some more stuff

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:50.090 
let's say I want to add some more stuff
