from here wow that's amazing tell us
what<00:01:45.560> does<00:01:45.650> it<00:01:45.770> do<00:01:46.030> basically<00:01:47.030> it<00:01:47.210> allows<00:01:47.330> you

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
what does it do basically it allows you

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:50.140 
what does it do basically it allows you
to<00:01:47.750> tune<00:01:48.590> it<00:01:48.710> using<00:01:48.890> the<00:01:48.950> program<00:01:49.130> button<00:01:49.520> or

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
to tune it using the program button or

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.320 
to tune it using the program button or
you<00:01:50.690> can<00:01:50.930> do<00:01:51.590> some<00:01:51.770> data<00:01:51.950> logging<00:01:52.330> monitoring

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
you can do some data logging monitoring

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.790 
you can do some data logging monitoring
with<00:01:53.420> the<00:01:53.509> vehicle<00:01:53.810> doing<00:01:54.110> using<00:01:54.530> the<00:01:54.649> data

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:54.800 
with the vehicle doing using the data

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.859 
with the vehicle doing using the data
log<00:01:54.979> button<00:01:55.250> it<00:01:56.090> allows<00:01:56.330> you<00:01:56.479> to<00:01:56.570> test<00:01:56.780> your

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
log button it allows you to test your

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:59.109 
log button it allows you to test your
performance<00:01:57.409> basically<00:01:57.920> how<00:01:58.580> pass<00:01:58.790> it<00:01:58.970> runs

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
performance basically how pass it runs

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.139 
performance basically how pass it runs
in<00:01:59.210> the<00:01:59.270> quarter<00:01:59.509> mile<00:02:00.220> which<00:02:01.220> is<00:02:01.369> 0-60<00:02:01.940> time

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
in the quarter mile which is 0-60 time

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:04.389 
in the quarter mile which is 0-60 time
is<00:02:02.299> to<00:02:02.420> a<00:02:02.479> vehicle<00:02:02.750> cops<00:02:03.560> do<00:02:03.770> the<00:02:03.890> vehicle<00:02:04.280> is

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
is to a vehicle cops do the vehicle is

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:06.670 
is to a vehicle cops do the vehicle is
done<00:02:04.670> or<00:02:04.970> made<00:02:05.240> of<00:02:05.420> times<00:02:05.690> and<00:02:05.990> then<00:02:06.530> also

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
done or made of times and then also

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.499 
done or made of times and then also
you're<00:02:07.100> breaking<00:02:07.520> from<00:02:07.670> a<00:02:07.820> certain<00:02:08.149> speed

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
you're breaking from a certain speed

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.509 
you're breaking from a certain speed
then<00:02:09.110> of<00:02:09.259> course<00:02:09.440> our<00:02:09.649> program<00:02:10.009> and<00:02:10.039> adjust

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:10.519 
then of course our program and adjust

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:12.009 
then of course our program and adjust
various<00:02:10.910> options<00:02:11.269> in<00:02:11.540> the<00:02:11.600> car<00:02:11.780> you<00:02:11.900> can

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 
various options in the car you can

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:14.410 
various options in the car you can
adjust<00:02:12.220> spark<00:02:13.220> you<00:02:13.760> can<00:02:13.910> adjust<00:02:14.000> how<00:02:14.360> much

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
adjust spark you can adjust how much

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.840 
adjust spark you can adjust how much
fuel<00:02:14.870> car<00:02:15.560> has<00:02:15.800> you<00:02:16.250> can<00:02:16.370> adjust<00:02:16.459> what<00:02:16.730> the

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
fuel car has you can adjust what the

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.190 
fuel car has you can adjust what the
speed<00:02:17.120> limiter<00:02:17.450> is<00:02:17.480> if<00:02:17.690> it's<00:02:17.810> an<00:02:17.900> automatic

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
speed limiter is if it's an automatic

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.160 
speed limiter is if it's an automatic
you<00:02:18.440> can<00:02:18.530> adjust<00:02:18.650> a<00:02:18.950> shift<00:02:19.220> point<00:02:19.489> how<00:02:20.209> firm<00:02:21.019> it

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
you can adjust a shift point how firm it

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.360 
you can adjust a shift point how firm it
shift<00:02:21.470> and<00:02:21.940> it<00:02:22.940> also<00:02:23.090> comes<00:02:23.480> preloaded<00:02:23.750> with

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
shift and it also comes preloaded with

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.770 
shift and it also comes preloaded with
hundreds<00:02:25.370> of<00:02:25.519> change<00:02:25.819> yeah<00:02:26.120> comes<00:02:26.450> pre-loaded

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
comes in the case is if you are the bits

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.710 
comes in the case is if you are the bits
and<00:02:37.459> pieces<00:02:37.730> in<00:02:37.880> there<00:02:38.000> what's<00:02:38.239> going<00:02:38.330> on<00:02:38.600> in

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
and pieces in there what's going on in

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.660 
and pieces in there what's going on in
there<00:02:38.870> there's<00:02:39.260> a<00:02:39.350> vehicle<00:02:39.860> interface<00:02:40.190> module

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
there there's a vehicle interface module

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.550 
there there's a vehicle interface module
which<00:02:40.819> allows<00:02:41.090> the<00:02:41.450> Bluetooth<00:02:42.019> connection<00:02:42.470> to

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:09.099 
what am I external boost gauge let's say
you<00:03:07.670> want<00:03:08.000> to<00:03:08.120> maybe<00:03:08.239> turn<00:03:08.510> on<00:03:08.630> a<00:03:08.660> nitrous

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:09.109 
you want to maybe turn on a nitrous

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:11.289 
you want to maybe turn on a nitrous
system<00:03:09.530> all<00:03:09.739> these<00:03:09.980> things<00:03:10.430> can<00:03:10.670> be<00:03:10.760> done<00:03:10.910> from

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
system all these things can be done from

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:13.449

the<00:03:12.019> vehicle<00:03:12.260> interface<00:03:12.650> module<00:03:13.100> with<00:03:13.340> the

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
the vehicle interface module with the

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.370 
the vehicle interface module with the
cable<00:03:13.760> that<00:03:13.880> I<00:03:13.910> provided<00:03:14.209> excellent<00:03:14.930> my<00:03:15.230> guess

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
cable that I provided excellent my guess

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:16.630 
cable that I provided excellent my guess
is<00:03:15.470> under<00:03:15.709> one<00:03:15.829> more<00:03:16.010> thing<00:03:16.160> to<00:03:16.250> do<00:03:16.370> and<00:03:16.549> that's

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
is under one more thing to do and that's

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.789 
is under one more thing to do and that's
careful<00:03:17.630> driving<00:03:17.870> this<00:03:18.079> Mustang<00:03:18.500> now<00:03:18.620> let's

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
careful driving this Mustang now let's

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:23.000 
careful driving this Mustang now let's
test<00:03:18.950> it<00:03:19.070> out

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.589 

so<00:03:23.549> the<00:03:23.640> custom<00:03:23.909> cheering<00:03:24.180> is<00:03:24.239> already<00:03:24.450> loaded

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:24.599 
so the custom cheering is already loaded
