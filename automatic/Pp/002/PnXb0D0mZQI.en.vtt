00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:01.350 

minute<00:02:55.630> and<00:02:55.780> very<00:02:55.990> sex

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.680 

starting<00:03:02.170> to<00:03:02.470> bubble<00:03:02.980> up

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
starting to bubble up

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.520 
starting to bubble up
in<00:03:05.020> there

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.510 

if<00:03:07.590> only<00:03:08.690> 43<00:03:09.690> seconds<00:03:10.140> to

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
if only 43 seconds to

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.650 
if only 43 seconds to
it's<00:03:11.970> already<00:03:12.210> making<00:03:12.630> motions<00:03:14.360> so<00:03:15.360> it's<00:03:15.510> out

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
it's already making motions so it's out

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.620 
it's already making motions so it's out
of<00:03:15.690> the<00:03:15.810> microwave<00:03:16.200> and<00:03:16.440> it<00:03:16.650> smells<00:03:17.010> really

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
a try with a okay so here's the

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.220 
a try with a okay so here's the
consistency<00:03:33.810> and<00:03:34.080> it's<00:03:34.410> squishy<00:03:34.740> like<00:03:35.040> cake

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
consistency and it's squishy like cake

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.130 
consistency and it's squishy like cake
this<00:03:37.230> one's<00:03:37.410> hot<00:03:37.590> and<00:03:38.490> they<00:03:39.150> smell<00:03:39.510> just<00:03:39.570> like

this one's hot and they smell just like
cake<00:03:41.420> but<00:03:42.420> I'm<00:03:42.510> guessing<00:03:42.690> since<00:03:42.960> you<00:03:43.140> only<00:03:43.320> had

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
cake but I'm guessing since you only had

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.060 
cake but I'm guessing since you only had
to<00:03:43.650> use<00:03:43.980> an<00:03:44.220> egg<00:03:45.410> it's<00:03:46.410> going<00:03:46.560> to<00:03:46.620> be<00:03:46.740> an<00:03:46.800> eggy

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
to use an egg it's going to be an eggy

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.920 
to use an egg it's going to be an eggy
flavor<00:03:47.220> in<00:03:47.760> an<00:03:47.850> eggy<00:03:48.470> texture<00:03:50.660> now<00:03:51.660> you<00:03:51.720> can

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
flavor in an eggy texture now you can

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.780 
flavor in an eggy texture now you can
easily<00:03:52.140> eat<00:03:52.530> them<00:03:52.710> out<00:03:52.860> of<00:03:52.920> the<00:03:53.100> cup<00:03:53.340> you<00:03:53.760> know

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
easily eat them out of the cup you know

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.030 
easily eat them out of the cup you know
but<00:03:54.180> I<00:03:54.210> just<00:03:54.420> wanted<00:03:54.660> to<00:03:54.780> show<00:03:54.930> you<00:03:54.960> guys<00:03:55.080> the

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
but I just wanted to show you guys the

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.190 
but I just wanted to show you guys the
consistency<00:03:56.880> and<00:03:57.030> how<00:03:57.150> much<00:03:57.330> they<00:03:57.570> expanded

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
consistency and how much they expanded

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.010 
consistency and how much they expanded
inside<00:03:58.860> the<00:03:59.070> actual<00:03:59.220> Cup<00:03:59.730> this<00:04:00.510> one<00:04:00.690> is<00:04:00.780> still

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.020 
inside the actual Cup this one is still

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.980 
inside the actual Cup this one is still
hot<00:04:01.260> so<00:04:01.290> it's<00:04:01.620> much<00:04:02.010> more<00:04:02.040> squishy<00:04:02.810> so<00:04:03.810> once

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:03.990 
hot so it's much more squishy so once

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:05.870 
hot so it's much more squishy so once
it's<00:04:04.140> cooled<00:04:04.320> down<00:04:04.590> it's<00:04:04.860> like<00:04:05.040> a<00:04:05.070> more<00:04:05.400> thick

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880
