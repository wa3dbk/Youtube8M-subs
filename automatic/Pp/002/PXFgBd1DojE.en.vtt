important<00:04:50.150> thing<00:04:50.330> with<00:04:50.449> foundations<00:04:51.080> is<00:04:51.289> to

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
important thing with foundations is to

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.379 
important thing with foundations is to
make<00:04:51.590> sure<00:04:51.770> you<00:04:51.889> get<00:04:52.009> one<00:04:52.190> that<00:04:52.220> suits<00:04:52.490> you<00:04:52.789> if

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:53.389 
make sure you get one that suits you if

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:55.450 
make sure you get one that suits you if
you<00:04:53.539> get<00:04:53.720> like<00:04:53.840> an<00:04:53.960> oily<00:04:54.139> skin<00:04:54.650> or<00:04:55.039> dry<00:04:55.310> skin
