doctor you've mentioned dental work and

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.269 
doctor you've mentioned dental work and
I<00:00:02.639> think<00:00:02.700> most<00:00:03.090> people<00:00:03.449> don't<00:00:03.750> connect<00:00:04.290> dental

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
I think most people don't connect dental

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.750 
I think most people don't connect dental
work<00:00:05.430> with<00:00:05.730> any<00:00:06.060> sort<00:00:06.359> of<00:00:06.450> disease<00:00:06.750> much<00:00:06.990> less

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:07.760 
work with any sort of disease much less

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.110 
work with any sort of disease much less
cancer<00:00:08.760> how<00:00:09.360> are<00:00:09.540> the<00:00:09.660> two<00:00:09.809> connected<00:00:10.410> and<00:00:10.590> and

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:11.120

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.440 
cancer how are the two connected and and
how<00:00:12.120> should<00:00:12.360> people<00:00:12.509> I<00:00:13.410> guess<00:00:13.889> respond<00:00:14.519> after

dental toxins block healing initiate
cancer<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.770> chronic<00:01:22.890> disease<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.880> can

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
cancer and chronic disease and can

cancer and chronic disease and can
improve<00:01:27.020> increase<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.259> progression<00:01:29.100> of

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
these chronic diseases by example the

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.270 
these chronic diseases by example the
biggest<00:01:34.020> thing<00:01:34.170> I've<00:01:34.290> ever<00:01:34.409> seen<00:01:34.829> of<00:01:35.130> a

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
biggest thing I've ever seen of a

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.510 
biggest thing I've ever seen of a
patient<00:01:35.990> healing<00:01:36.990> after<00:01:37.439> having<00:01:37.950> dental<00:01:38.400> work

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
patient healing after having dental work

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.719 
patient healing after having dental work
done<00:01:38.820> was<00:01:39.060> in<00:01:39.299> in<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.689> dental<00:01:40.079> chair<00:01:40.490> she<00:01:41.490> was

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
done was in in the dental chair she was

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.980 
done was in in the dental chair she was
he<00:01:42.450> was<00:01:42.659> John<00:01:43.110> John<00:01:44.040> from<00:01:44.670> LA<00:01:45.000> he<00:01:45.600> was<00:01:45.780> there

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
he was John John from LA he was there

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.069 
he was John John from LA he was there
and<00:01:46.079> he<00:01:46.229> had<00:01:46.340> my<00:01:47.340> steena<00:01:47.640> gravis<00:01:48.149> a<00:01:48.360> very

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
and he had my steena gravis a very

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.649 
and he had my steena gravis a very
chronic<00:01:49.500> progressive<00:01:50.100> disease<00:01:50.640> where<00:01:51.450> the

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
chronic progressive disease where the

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.370 
chronic progressive disease where the
muscles<00:01:52.200> start<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.130> lose<00:01:53.490> their<00:01:53.759> tone<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.450> so

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
muscles start to lose their tone and so

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.649 
muscles start to lose their tone and so
remember<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.610> muscles<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.149> respiration

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
remember the the muscles of respiration

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.200 
remember the the muscles of respiration
are<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.110> diaphragms<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:59.009> these<00:01:59.640> patients

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
are the diaphragms and these patients

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.690 
are the diaphragms and these patients
usually<00:02:00.329> die<00:02:00.810> from<00:02:01.170> paralysis<00:02:02.159> of<00:02:02.549> the

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
usually die from paralysis of the

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.219 
usually die from paralysis of the
diaphragm<00:02:02.820> and<00:02:03.570> they<00:02:03.659> go<00:02:03.780> into<00:02:03.930> respiratory

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
diaphragm and they go into respiratory

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.130 
diaphragm and they go into respiratory
arrest<00:02:04.979> and<00:02:05.329> subsequently<00:02:06.329> cardiac<00:02:06.810> arrest

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
arrest and subsequently cardiac arrest

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.949 
arrest and subsequently cardiac arrest
and<00:02:07.799> so<00:02:08.190> John<00:02:08.610> was<00:02:08.940> having<00:02:09.090> a<00:02:09.330> problem<00:02:09.629> with

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
and so John was having a problem with

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.050 
and so John was having a problem with
this<00:02:10.110> that<00:02:10.410> it<00:02:10.500> was<00:02:10.619> my<00:02:11.190> senior<00:02:11.550> gravis<00:02:11.910> was

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
this that it was my senior gravis was

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.059 
this that it was my senior gravis was
progressing

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
progressing

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.309

and qi &amp; chakras and all that the teeth
are<00:03:02.810> organs<00:03:03.349> this<00:03:03.590> is<00:03:03.739> one<00:03:03.980> thing<00:03:04.190> that<00:03:04.220> we

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
are organs this is one thing that we

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:06.369 
are organs this is one thing that we
have<00:03:04.639> to<00:03:04.819> understand<00:03:05.389> is<00:03:05.629> that<00:03:05.659> the<00:03:05.930> teeth<00:03:06.170> is

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:06.379 
have to understand is that the teeth is

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:10.420 
have to understand is that the teeth is
not<00:03:06.590> just<00:03:07.329> inanimate<00:03:08.739> thing<00:03:09.739> there<00:03:09.980> it's<00:03:10.220> an

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
not just inanimate thing there it's an

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.460 
not just inanimate thing there it's an
organ<00:03:10.940> each<00:03:11.150> teeth<00:03:11.480> is<00:03:11.690> an<00:03:11.810> organ<00:03:12.109> and<00:03:12.260> they're

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
organ each teeth is an organ and they're

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.099 
organ each teeth is an organ and they're
associated<00:03:13.340> with<00:03:13.879> visceral<00:03:14.450> parts<00:03:14.810> of<00:03:14.930> our

is associated with a particular
structure<00:03:24.079> in<00:03:24.290> our<00:03:24.379> body<00:03:24.650> and<00:03:25.160> there's<00:03:25.730> been

that<00:03:28.269> females<00:03:29.269> and<00:03:29.690> I<00:03:29.750> say<00:03:29.959> females<00:03:30.319> because

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
that females and I say females because

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.619 
that females and I say females because
men<00:03:30.949> can<00:03:31.220> get<00:03:31.370> breast<00:03:31.430> cancer<00:03:32.090> as<00:03:32.239> well<00:03:32.419> but

men can get breast cancer as well but

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:35.050 
men can get breast cancer as well but
females<00:03:33.079> with<00:03:33.260> breast<00:03:33.500> cancer<00:03:33.910> typically<00:03:34.910> in

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:43.879 
lot of heavy metals in there in their

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:46.119 
lot of heavy metals in there in their
teeth<00:03:44.120> and<00:03:44.329> once<00:03:45.019> you<00:03:45.230> start<00:03:45.560> pulling<00:03:45.859> that

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:46.129 
teeth and once you start pulling that

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:48.900 
teeth and once you start pulling that
toxin<00:03:46.849> out<00:03:47.000> you<00:03:47.780> can<00:03:47.989> see<00:03:48.230> tremendous

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
toxin out you can see tremendous

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.629 
toxin out you can see tremendous
improvement<00:03:49.959> and<00:03:50.959> for<00:03:51.199> example<00:03:51.709> what<00:03:52.370> is<00:03:52.489> this

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:52.639 
improvement and for example what is this

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:54.159 
improvement and for example what is this
doing<00:03:53.000> right<00:03:53.449> because<00:03:53.690> that's<00:03:53.810> the<00:03:54.049> ultimate

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:54.169 
doing right because that's the ultimate

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:56.229 
doing right because that's the ultimate
question<00:03:54.680> what<00:03:55.040> are<00:03:55.069> these<00:03:55.370> toxins<00:03:56.000> doing

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
question what are these toxins doing

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:57.729 
question what are these toxins doing
they're<00:03:56.389> depressing<00:03:56.750> your<00:03:57.019> immune<00:03:57.199> system

00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:57.739 
they're depressing your immune system

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:01.000 
they're depressing your immune system
every<00:03:58.430> day<00:03:58.639> it's<00:03:59.359> a<00:03:59.540> little<00:03:59.690> it's<00:04:00.650> tapping

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
every day it's a little it's tapping

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.729 
every day it's a little it's tapping
draining<00:04:01.699> your<00:04:01.849> immune<00:04:02.150> system<00:04:02.659> right<00:04:02.989> and<00:04:03.290> of

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
draining your immune system right and of

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:06.000 
draining your immune system right and of
course<00:04:04.010> we<00:04:04.280> know<00:04:04.459> that<00:04:04.489> mercury<00:04:05.269> cadmium

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
course we know that mercury cadmium

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.979 
course we know that mercury cadmium
aluminum<00:04:07.010> nickel<00:04:07.250> these<00:04:08.060> are<00:04:08.239> all<00:04:08.299> very<00:04:08.599> toxic

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
aluminum nickel these are all very toxic

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:11.530 
aluminum nickel these are all very toxic
metals<00:04:09.650> and<00:04:09.979> so<00:04:10.250> you<00:04:10.849> know<00:04:10.940> what<00:04:11.090> is<00:04:11.209> it<00:04:11.329> doing

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
metals and so you know what is it doing

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.960 
metals and so you know what is it doing
to<00:04:11.569> our<00:04:11.810> brain<00:04:12.079> cells<00:04:12.379> what's<00:04:12.769> doing<00:04:13.250> to<00:04:13.489> the

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
to our brain cells what's doing to the

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.680 
to our brain cells what's doing to the
heart<00:04:14.269> muscles<00:04:14.780> and<00:04:15.199> and

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
heart muscles and and

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.860 
heart muscles and and
many<00:04:17.620> other<00:04:17.799> structures<00:04:18.220> in<00:04:18.400> the<00:04:18.700> body<00:04:18.850> so<00:04:19.299> I'm

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
many other structures in the body so I'm

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.360 
many other structures in the body so I'm
not<00:04:19.959> sure<00:04:20.019> if<00:04:20.260> I<00:04:20.350> answered<00:04:20.739> your<00:04:20.799> question

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
not sure if I answered your question

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.480 
not sure if I answered your question
yeah<00:04:21.790> and<00:04:22.150> in<00:04:22.390> root<00:04:22.660> canals<00:04:23.020> what<00:04:23.920> what's<00:04:24.340> the

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
yeah and in root canals what what's the

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.000 
yeah and in root canals what what's the
problem<00:04:24.760> with<00:04:24.850> their<00:04:25.030> that<00:04:25.210> the<00:04:25.330> bacteria

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
problem with their that the bacteria

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.240 
problem with their that the bacteria
gets<00:04:27.010> in<00:04:27.190> that's<00:04:27.400> those<00:04:27.910> spots<00:04:28.660> or<00:04:28.900> what

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
gets in that's those spots or what

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.530 
gets in that's those spots or what
imagine<00:04:30.250> what<00:04:30.490> happens<00:04:30.940> with<00:04:31.090> a<00:04:31.120> root<00:04:31.390> canal

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
imagine what happens with a root canal

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.560 
imagine what happens with a root canal
were<00:04:31.990> removing<00:04:32.950> the<00:04:33.250> root<00:04:33.490> which<00:04:34.000> is<00:04:34.030> a<00:04:34.210> nerve

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
were removing the root which is a nerve

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:39.570 
were removing the root which is a nerve
so<00:04:35.410> a<00:04:35.860> a<00:04:36.430> tooth<00:04:37.180> without<00:04:37.630> a<00:04:37.660> nerve<00:04:38.020> is<00:04:38.410> what<00:04:39.370> a

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
so a a tooth without a nerve is what a

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.530 
so a a tooth without a nerve is what a
dead<00:04:40.030> tooth<00:04:40.330> right<00:04:41.320> and<00:04:41.790> this<00:04:42.790> nerve<00:04:43.210> it's

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:43.540 
dead tooth right and this nerve it's

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.530 
dead tooth right and this nerve it's
just<00:04:43.750> not<00:04:43.930> one<00:04:44.230> nerve<00:04:44.560> it<00:04:45.430> has<00:04:45.700> a<00:04:45.730> lot<00:04:46.180> of<00:04:46.210> other

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 
just not one nerve it has a lot of other

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.470 
just not one nerve it has a lot of other
fibers<00:04:47.230> of<00:04:47.470> nerve<00:04:47.860> structures<00:04:48.730> and<00:04:49.090> also

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:49.480 
fibers of nerve structures and also

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.170 
fibers of nerve structures and also
blood<00:04:49.750> vessels<00:04:50.290> so<00:04:50.950> what<00:04:51.160> tools<00:04:51.520> as<00:04:51.730> I<00:04:51.850> said<00:04:52.060> is

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
blood vessels so what tools as I said is

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.420 
blood vessels so what tools as I said is
an<00:04:52.300> organ<00:04:52.690> it's<00:04:52.900> dynamic<00:04:53.620> it's<00:04:53.860> getting

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
an organ it's dynamic it's getting

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.750 
an organ it's dynamic it's getting
nutrients<00:04:55.290> eliminating<00:04:56.290> waste<00:04:56.530> each<00:04:56.950> one<00:04:57.550> of

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
nutrients eliminating waste each one of

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.530 
nutrients eliminating waste each one of
our<00:04:57.910> teeth<00:04:58.270> yeah<00:04:59.140> or<00:04:59.410> yeah<00:04:59.890> so<00:05:00.220> when<00:05:00.880> we<00:05:01.090> remove

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:01.540 
our teeth yeah or yeah so when we remove

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.680 
our teeth yeah or yeah so when we remove
the<00:05:02.080> nerve<00:05:02.260> where<00:05:02.920> döner<00:05:03.670> vaiting<00:05:04.210> that<00:05:04.420> tooth

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
the nerve where döner vaiting that tooth

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.270 
the nerve where döner vaiting that tooth
were<00:05:05.320> killing<00:05:05.890> it

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
were killing it

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.680 
were killing it
it's<00:05:06.730> just<00:05:07.210> has<00:05:08.170> no<00:05:08.530> source<00:05:09.040> of<00:05:09.280> nutrition<00:05:09.700> no

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
it's just has no source of nutrition no

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:14.100 
it's just has no source of nutrition no
source<00:05:10.990> of<00:05:11.230> oxygen<00:05:11.640> it's<00:05:12.660> isolated<00:05:13.660> from<00:05:13.930> the

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
source of oxygen it's isolated from the

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.650 
source of oxygen it's isolated from the
environment<00:05:14.230> the<00:05:15.010> micro<00:05:15.460> environment<00:05:16.180> so<00:05:16.360> as

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:16.660 
environment the micro environment so as

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.520 
environment the micro environment so as
you<00:05:16.870> say<00:05:17.110> this<00:05:17.320> is<00:05:17.590> a<00:05:17.620> haven<00:05:18.070> for<00:05:19.530> infections

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
you say this is a haven for infections

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:23.700 
you say this is a haven for infections
and<00:05:20.860> be<00:05:21.520> it<00:05:21.700> not<00:05:22.030> always<00:05:22.390> or<00:05:22.870> these<00:05:23.050> infections

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
and be it not always or these infections

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.040 
and be it not always or these infections
RQ<00:05:24.190> right<00:05:24.520> where<00:05:24.760> someone<00:05:25.090> has<00:05:25.270> fever<00:05:25.780> and

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
RQ right where someone has fever and

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:27.900 
RQ right where someone has fever and
pain<00:05:26.320> and<00:05:26.680> swelling<00:05:26.980> this<00:05:27.340> could<00:05:27.520> be<00:05:27.640> sub

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:27.910 
pain and swelling this could be sub

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.150 
pain and swelling this could be sub
acute<00:05:28.240> infection<00:05:28.780> where<00:05:29.500> there's<00:05:29.770> a<00:05:29.890> low

enough to cause common over symptoms but
tapping<00:05:38.470> your<00:05:38.620> immune<00:05:38.830> system<00:05:39.280> every<00:05:39.550> day<00:05:39.730> so

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 
tapping your immune system every day so

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.260 
tapping your immune system every day so
some<00:05:41.500> of<00:05:41.530> the<00:05:41.680> best<00:05:41.860> biological<00:05:42.550> dentists<00:05:43.120> and

researchers and scientists in the world

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.090 
researchers and scientists in the world
say<00:05:45.490> there<00:05:45.700> is<00:05:45.850> no<00:05:46.120> healthy<00:05:47.110> root<00:05:47.380> canal<00:05:47.830> tooth

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:48.100 
say there is no healthy root canal tooth

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.909 
say there is no healthy root canal tooth
and<00:05:49.000> so<00:05:49.419> and<00:05:49.750> today<00:05:50.020> in<00:05:50.230> one<00:05:50.410> of<00:05:50.530> our<00:05:50.650> lectures

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:50.919 
and so and today in one of our lectures

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:54.030 
and so and today in one of our lectures
I<00:05:51.430> learned<00:05:52.120> that<00:05:52.450> I<00:05:53.020> don't<00:05:53.560> remember<00:05:53.800> the

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:54.040 
I learned that I don't remember the

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.630 
I learned that I don't remember the
doctors<00:05:54.460> name<00:05:54.700> who<00:05:55.060> was<00:05:55.390> an<00:05:55.690> a<00:05:56.260> dentist<00:05:57.070> and<00:05:57.400> he

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:57.640 
doctors name who was an a dentist and he

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:03.000 
doctors name who was an a dentist and he
was<00:05:58.390> the<00:05:58.630> one<00:05:58.810> that<00:05:59.050> founded<00:05:59.770> the<00:06:02.010> American

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.010 
was the one that founded the American

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:05.400 
was the one that founded the American

Association for endodontic sore root
canals<00:06:05.800> and<00:06:06.130> later<00:06:06.790> on<00:06:07.030> in<00:06:07.210> his<00:06:07.360> life<00:06:07.630> he<00:06:08.080> wrote

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:08.110 
canals and later on in his life he wrote

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:11.850 
canals and later on in his life he wrote
a<00:06:08.380> book<00:06:08.710> of<00:06:09.010> why<00:06:09.970> root<00:06:10.390> canals<00:06:10.810> are<00:06:11.169> bad<00:06:11.500> for

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:11.860 
a book of why root canals are bad for

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.790 
a book of why root canals are bad for
you<00:06:12.010> so<00:06:12.669> he<00:06:12.910> saw<00:06:13.300> the<00:06:13.360> light<00:06:13.630> right<00:06:13.960> and<00:06:14.350> but

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:14.800 
you so he saw the light right and but

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.290 
you so he saw the light right and but
you<00:06:15.010> know<00:06:15.100> those<00:06:15.280> things<00:06:15.490> are<00:06:15.669> kind<00:06:15.880> of<00:06:15.970> buried

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:16.300 
you know those things are kind of buried

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:17.119 
you know those things are kind of buried
and<00:06:16.510> no<00:06:16.600> one

00:06:17.119 --> 00:06:17.129 
and no one
