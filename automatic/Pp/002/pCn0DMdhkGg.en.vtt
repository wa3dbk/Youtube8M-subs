00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
drifting you guys can still use the same

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.490 
drifting you guys can still use the same
tune<00:01:53.270> if<00:01:53.570> you<00:01:53.690> if<00:01:53.930> you<00:01:54.020> have<00:01:54.110> to<00:01:54.230> use<00:01:54.350> the

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
tune if you if you have to use the

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.580 
tune if you if you have to use the
regular<00:01:54.890> Camaro<00:01:55.510> it'll<00:01:56.510> obviously<00:01:56.720> work<00:01:57.230> and

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
regular Camaro it'll obviously work and

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.800 
regular Camaro it'll obviously work and
the<00:01:57.800> horsepower<00:01:58.210> it<00:01:59.210> doesn't<00:01:59.480> really<00:01:59.600> matter

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
the horsepower it doesn't really matter

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.420 
the horsepower it doesn't really matter
because<00:02:00.110> I'm<00:02:00.380> not<00:02:00.500> using<00:02:00.680> the<00:02:00.920> stock<00:02:01.160> engine

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
because I'm not using the stock engine

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.220 
because I'm not using the stock engine
if<00:02:01.730> you<00:02:01.850> watch<00:02:02.000> them<00:02:02.240> the<00:02:02.330> video<00:02:02.570> i'm<00:02:02.870> using

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:03.230 
if you watch them the video i'm using

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.470 
if you watch them the video i'm using
the<00:02:03.350> camaro<00:02:03.710> engine<00:02:04.190> so<00:02:04.760> all<00:02:05.030> you<00:02:05.150> have<00:02:05.180> to<00:02:05.300> do

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:05.480 
the camaro engine so all you have to do

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.690 
the camaro engine so all you have to do
is<00:02:05.690> just<00:02:05.720> change<00:02:06.140> to<00:02:06.350> the<00:02:06.440> camaro<00:02:06.740> engine<00:02:06.890> with

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
is just change to the camaro engine with

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.730 
is just change to the camaro engine with
the<00:02:07.850> regular<00:02:08.179> camaro<00:02:08.540> how<00:02:08.990> you<00:02:09.050> use<00:02:09.410> if<00:02:09.649> you

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
the regular camaro how you use if you

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.350 
the regular camaro how you use if you
don't<00:02:09.920> have<00:02:10.010> to<00:02:10.160> a<00:02:10.190> rare<00:02:10.580> one<00:02:10.730> like<00:02:10.910> this<00:02:11.090> and

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
don't have to a rare one like this and

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.530 
don't have to a rare one like this and
you<00:02:12.350> just<00:02:12.470> go<00:02:12.620> from<00:02:12.740> there<00:02:12.830> so<00:02:13.210> really<00:02:14.210> you're

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
you just go from there so really you're

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:15.820 
you just go from there so really you're
not<00:02:14.660> really<00:02:14.840> limited<00:02:15.230> to<00:02:15.290> anything<00:02:15.530> i<00:02:15.800> just

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
not really limited to anything i just

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.680 
not really limited to anything i just
chose<00:02:16.250> this<00:02:16.430> because<00:02:16.490> of<00:02:16.880> preference<00:02:17.390> and<00:02:17.600> i

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
chose this because of preference and i

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.510 
chose this because of preference and i
like<00:02:17.870> the<00:02:18.020> look<00:02:18.170> and<00:02:18.440> I<00:02:18.740> get<00:02:18.950> the<00:02:19.070> rain<00:02:19.250> page

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
like the look and I get the rain page

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.430 
like the look and I get the rain page
Jackson<00:02:20.180> design<00:02:20.630> on<00:02:20.840> there<00:02:21.020> which<00:02:21.170> is<00:02:21.230> pretty

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
Jackson design on there which is pretty

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.920 
Jackson design on there which is pretty
cool<00:02:21.740> but<00:02:22.520> anyways<00:02:23.000> guys<00:02:23.180> I<00:02:23.240> did<00:02:23.510> two<00:02:23.690> laps

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
cool but anyways guys I did two laps

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.530 
cool but anyways guys I did two laps
just<00:02:24.290> because<00:02:24.590> this<00:02:24.770> track<00:02:25.070> is<00:02:25.400> small<00:02:26.150> it's<00:02:26.450> a

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
just because this track is small it's a

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.530 
just because this track is small it's a
slug<00:02:27.140> circuit<00:02:27.650> so<00:02:27.980> I<00:02:28.280> wanted<00:02:28.970> to<00:02:29.090> do<00:02:29.180> two<00:02:29.360> laps

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
slug circuit so I wanted to do two laps

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.470 
slug circuit so I wanted to do two laps
and<00:02:29.930> I<00:02:30.260> thought<00:02:30.470> it<00:02:31.160> would<00:02:31.340> be<00:02:31.459> great<00:02:31.670> to<00:02:32.030> show

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
and I thought it would be great to show

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.930 
and I thought it would be great to show
off<00:02:32.660> this<00:02:32.959> means
