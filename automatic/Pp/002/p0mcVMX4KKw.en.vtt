00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:21.509
 small steps 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.460
 make me observant and resourceful 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:30.289
 so that the diversity of everyday life on time 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:34.769
 dwell on discoveries and experiences 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:37.019
 who excited me teach me 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:41.460
 properly manage my time 

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:43.739
 give me a fine sense of life to 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.420
 distinguish primary from 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:52.320

 abstinence and measures so that I am not in life 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.000
 fluttered and did not slip 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.890
 but reasonably planned for the day to 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.799
 see tops and gave 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:05.570
 and at least sometimes would find time for 

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:05.570
 enjoyment of art 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.640
 help me understand that dreams can't 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.640
 to be help not dreams about the past not dreams 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:18.549
 about the future help me to be here and now 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.610
 and perceive this moment as the most 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:23.920
 important 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:27.219

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:30.329
 my life should be smooth give me 

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:33.250
 clear awareness of the difficulty 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:37.030
 defeat falls and failures are 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:40.860
 only a natural part of life 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:44.020
 thanks to which we grow and vision 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:47.319
 remind me that the heart often argues with 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.959
 send me at the right moment 

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:55.929

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:58.869
 i am true but tell her loving i know what 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:04.270
 many problems are solved if nothing 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:06.750

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:20.760
 moment at the right time in the right place 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:24.150
 silently or speaking to give to someone 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.150
 necessary heat 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:29.720
 make me a man who can 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:33.030
 to reach those who are just below 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.890

 in life 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:41.490
