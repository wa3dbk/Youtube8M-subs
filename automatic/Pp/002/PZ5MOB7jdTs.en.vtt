00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.650
 no we go together in this video 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.870
 watch the logitec in rock art 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.030
 keyboard cover for the ipad mini 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.860
 the larger variant is actually mine 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.699
 most used accessory for the ipad 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.230
 3 

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:16.170
 and I would almost say that I am not there 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.410
 without I can really really like to type on 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.300
 the ipad and then really only on 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.529
 the ultrathin keyboard cover 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.839
 hello jack has but is now also the 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.289
 version sent for ipad mini for 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:29.970
 look at that and yes it is 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.630
 what you have to say about it is of course 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.789
 a 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.710
 keybord that must be within the dimensions 

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:36.539
 Staying the iPad mini is a lot 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.949
 smaller because the ipad mini is natural 

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:42.840
 but 7.9 inches good in design and in terms of 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:45.269
 materials it is just a luxury product 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.309
 just like the the larger version it is van 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:50.129
 form of beautiful pia 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.690
 made materials and logitec 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.579
 chose to leave it at all 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.079
 match the design of the ipad mini 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.969
 meaning that it is also the one in two 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.500
 colors is coming and I have the black one here 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.750
 version and that is just the same 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.739
 finish and structure as the black 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.780
 ipad mini 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.010
 the black slate colors the way they do it 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.410
 to mention 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.840
 good to still meet a little bit 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.730
 It really comes to the type 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.350
 logitech choices made 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.730
 when it comes to the layout of it 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.620
 keyboard 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.350
 they actually have a few buttons 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.880
 have them combined so you 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.770
 own at the far left of the keyboard 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.300
 sit there you normally still find 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.750
 the caps lock next 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:30.900
 and the q3 that is combined with normal 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.220
 the appen button teab 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.140
 yes that takes some getting used to 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.000
 of course you also have to get used to the 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.880
 smaller keys but those modified 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.200
 layout that I now that costs that anyway 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.270
 some getting used to 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.890
 fortunately the cat gulp and the tab 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.480
 button still to use if you have it 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.570
 in combination with the function key 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.130
 use third fn key 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.930
 upwards just like a lot of loach 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.550
 cover buttons or there keyboards 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.660
 then sit a numerical row that too 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.330
 again combined with what 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.220
 function keys and on the right 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.600
 you can also find some arrow keys and with 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.030
 select keys that make it easier 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.220
 make it process texts on that 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.630
 ipad mini 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.610
 I just had to be reasonable 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.380
 do my best to get used to the thing 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.270
 And I also notice that every time I do 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.340
 I start off a few more times 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.380
 sit while as I can give up with one 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.030
 few sentences that I am yes then 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.650
 one of those you more that click it in my 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.450
 head then I can tap much easier 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.040
 so in the end it is best usable 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.560
 device 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.300
 especially when you see how little space and 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.370
 take up weight say I am staring into you 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.160
 bag it is not comparable to one 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.319
 real keyboard and indeed I think 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.340
 also not really that you should want that 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.220
 maybe you should compare it more 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.580
 with our king keyboard from the ipad with 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.900
 I would prefer this with this keyboard 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.519
 when I am somewhere and want some e-mails 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.560
 process or possibly a short one 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.090
 write piece for tablets magazine 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.590
 I wouldn't write a real book 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.540
 really want to do on the 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.120
 on the ipad mini with this uh that in 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.519
 suitcase good 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.870
 stores from 80 euros is available at 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.829
 different places and in two 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.440
 different colors 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:03.910
 as far as I am concerned, that is quite a lot 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.040
 money certainly because you apply to that 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.140
 of course all kinds of other real ones 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.450
 can buy keyboards there are makes 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.069
 of course or the consideration that you 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.930
 need more space in your bag 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:14.950
 for example if you want one if you want to come 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.019
 take 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.269
 all in all so yes an interesting product 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:20.380
 to consider if you can if you are good 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:21.340
 can get used to different 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.069
 keyboards 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.940
 and if you are also on your ipad mini quiet 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:26.859
 want to tap pieces 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.139
 well that is my view of the ultrathin 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:30.489
 keyboard cover for the ipad mini you have 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:31.480
 a question about this or about another 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.769
 movie 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.319
 leave a comment below 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:39.120
 youtube or also magazine.nl 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.120
 that was again until next time
