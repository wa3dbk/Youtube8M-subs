00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
master that's the old ending or a new

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.240 
master that's the old ending or a new
one<00:01:30.689> but<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.170> ending<00:01:31.409> was<00:01:31.560> alright<00:01:31.920> nothing

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
it's a very brief little conversation

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.910 
it's a very brief little conversation
and<00:01:57.180> I<00:01:57.390> was<00:01:57.570> like<00:01:57.719> okay<00:01:58.079> you<00:01:58.140> know<00:01:58.380> start<00:01:58.829> off

saber-tooth<00:01:59.460> we're<00:01:59.850> going<00:02:00.119> strong<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:01.280> then

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
saber-tooth we're going strong and then

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.499 
saber-tooth we're going strong and then
a<00:02:02.759> minute<00:02:03.630> in<00:02:03.780> we<00:02:04.439> are<00:02:04.649> in<00:02:05.070> filler<00:02:05.520> land<00:02:05.850> which

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
a minute in we are in filler land which

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.630 
a minute in we are in filler land which
is<00:02:06.719> I<00:02:06.750> guess<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.079> conclusion<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.190> this

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
is I guess the conclusion to this

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.119 
is I guess the conclusion to this
previous<00:02:08.970> billow<00:02:09.360> arc<00:02:09.709> honestly<00:02:10.709> this<00:02:10.920> was

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
previous billow arc honestly this was

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.120 
previous billow arc honestly this was
not<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.670> place<00:02:11.970> or<00:02:12.270> time

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
not the place or time

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.940 
not the place or time
for<00:02:13.340> this<00:02:13.610> filler<00:02:13.940> ending<00:02:14.420> at<00:02:14.600> all<00:02:14.900> you<00:02:15.620> wanted

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:50.260 
let's just get through it and you know
it<00:05:49.190> was<00:05:49.310> just<00:05:49.400> really<00:05:49.550> disappointing

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:50.270 
it was just really disappointing

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:52.420 
it was just really disappointing
hopefully<00:05:51.259> next<00:05:51.409> episode<00:05:51.860> there's<00:05:52.039> nothing

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430 
hopefully next episode there's nothing

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:53.469 
hopefully next episode there's nothing
like<00:05:52.520> that<00:05:52.699> I<00:05:52.729> don't<00:05:52.940> think<00:05:53.120> there<00:05:53.210> would<00:05:53.419> be

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:53.479 
like that I don't think there would be

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:54.969 
like that I don't think there would be
because<00:05:53.779> it<00:05:53.810> was<00:05:53.960> just<00:05:54.020> really<00:05:54.169> a<00:05:54.349> wrap-up<00:05:54.589> but

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:54.979 
because it was just really a wrap-up but

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:57.100 
because it was just really a wrap-up but
you<00:05:55.729> never<00:05:55.969> know<00:05:56.210> what<00:05:56.449> what<00:05:56.689> they<00:05:56.810> have

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110 
you never know what what they have

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.779 
you never know what what they have
planned<00:05:57.379> with<00:05:57.650> the<00:05:57.680> pacing<00:05:58.250> or<00:05:58.339> not<00:05:58.550> because

00:05:58.779 --> 00:05:58.789 
planned with the pacing or not because

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:00.909 
planned with the pacing or not because
they<00:05:58.879> do<00:05:59.120> gotta<00:05:59.360> slow<00:06:00.199> down<00:06:00.229> a<00:06:00.469> bit<00:06:00.620> so<00:06:00.889> that

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:00.919 
they do gotta slow down a bit so that

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:02.550 
they do gotta slow down a bit so that
they<00:06:01.069> don't<00:06:01.219> catch<00:06:01.339> up<00:06:01.520> to<00:06:01.610> the<00:06:01.699> manga<00:06:02.060> but<00:06:02.089> it
