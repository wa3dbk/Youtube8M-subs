00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.269 
the VTEC yellow and I want to change the
air<00:00:29.940> filter<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:31.260> I've<00:00:31.380> taken<00:00:31.560> it<00:00:31.770> out<00:00:31.920> of<00:00:32.039> here

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
air filter and I've taken it out of here

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.920 
air filter and I've taken it out of here
that's<00:00:32.730> where<00:00:32.910> it<00:00:33.000> goes<00:00:33.260> and<00:00:35.329> goes<00:00:36.329> back<00:00:36.600> into

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
that's where it goes and goes back into

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.440 
that's where it goes and goes back into
some<00:00:37.260> throttle<00:00:37.710> body<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.430> crap<00:00:38.760> is<00:00:39.000> back<00:00:39.239> in

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
some throttle body and crap is back in

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.350 
some throttle body and crap is back in
here<00:00:39.960> I<00:00:40.250> think<00:00:41.250> half<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.730> engines<00:00:42.090> under<00:00:42.329> the

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
here I think half the engines under the

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.049 
here I think half the engines under the
driver<00:00:42.750> seat<00:00:43.079> or<00:00:43.260> something<00:00:43.640> so<00:00:44.640> who's<00:00:44.790> so

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
driver seat or something so who's so

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.110 
driver seat or something so who's so
short<00:00:45.690> in<00:00:45.840> these<00:00:45.989> things<00:00:46.399> but<00:00:47.399> let<00:00:47.910> me<00:00:48.000> show

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
short in these things but let me show

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.610 
short in these things but let me show
you<00:00:48.210> what<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.450> filter<00:00:48.660> looked<00:00:48.809> like<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.440> why

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
you what the filter looked like and why

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.400 
you what the filter looked like and why
it's<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.860> good<00:00:49.980> idea<00:00:50.040> to<00:00:50.399> check<00:00:50.550> these<00:00:50.730> things

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
it's a good idea to check these things

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.959 
it's a good idea to check these things
so<00:00:52.410> I<00:00:52.500> opened<00:00:52.739> up<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.980> filter<00:00:53.280> box<00:00:53.489> on<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:53.879> and

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
so I opened up the filter box on it and

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.229 
so I opened up the filter box on it and
I<00:00:54.000> thought<00:00:54.210> geez<00:00:54.450> that<00:00:54.629> doesn't<00:00:54.899> look<00:00:54.960> too<00:00:55.020> bad

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
I thought geez that doesn't look too bad

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:02.180 
I thought geez that doesn't look too bad
and<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.360> turned<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.660> over<00:00:57.780> Oh<00:00:58.460> God<00:01:00.170> so<00:01:01.190> nice

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
and it turned it over Oh God so nice

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.420 
and it turned it over Oh God so nice
fresh<00:01:02.579> filter<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.390> go<00:01:03.539> in<00:01:03.690> or<00:01:03.840> there<00:01:04.430> maybe

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
fresh filter to go in or there maybe

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.800 
fresh filter to go in or there maybe

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
that'll help her breathe a little better

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.630 
that'll help her breathe a little better

that<00:02:20.660> it<00:02:20.750> has<00:02:20.900> oil<00:02:21.110> in<00:02:21.290> it<00:02:22.239> the<00:02:23.239> first<00:02:23.480> car<00:02:23.690> with

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
that it has oil in it the first car with

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.180 
that it has oil in it the first car with
coil<00:02:24.140> on<00:02:24.350> plug<00:02:24.790> hopefully<00:02:25.790> that's<00:02:26.000> reliable

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
coil on plug hopefully that's reliable

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.100 
coil on plug hopefully that's reliable
supposed<00:02:28.190> to<00:02:28.280> be<00:02:28.370> pretty<00:02:28.520> good<00:02:28.780> if<00:02:29.780> you<00:02:29.840> like

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
supposed to be pretty good if you like

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.130 
supposed to be pretty good if you like
engines<00:02:30.590> you<00:02:30.709> should<00:02:30.890> probably<00:02:31.100> look<00:02:31.340> up<00:02:31.550> the

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
engines you should probably look up the

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.280 
engines you should probably look up the
r18<00:02:33.140> a1<00:02:33.860> engine<00:02:34.280> which<00:02:34.459> is<00:02:34.489> this<00:02:34.790> one<00:02:35.000> and

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
r18 a1 engine which is this one and

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.810 
r18 a1 engine which is this one and
check<00:02:36.290> out<00:02:36.440> the<00:02:36.560> VTEC<00:02:36.920> system<00:02:36.950> on<00:02:37.430> it<00:02:37.550> it<00:02:37.640> works

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
check out the VTEC system on it it works

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.970 
check out the VTEC system on it it works
the<00:02:38.060> opposite<00:02:38.720> way<00:02:38.900> of<00:02:39.230> the<00:02:39.350> old<00:02:39.380> VTEC<00:02:39.950> system

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
the opposite way of the old VTEC system

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.910 
the opposite way of the old VTEC system
is<00:02:40.519> pretty<00:02:40.730> neat
