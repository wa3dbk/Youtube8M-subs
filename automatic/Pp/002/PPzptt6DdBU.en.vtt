00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.450
 hallÃ¶chen gets his next episode 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.860
 programming bucket plates today goes 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.820
 how to save it in the inventory 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.220
 can change from you to another 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.630
 player and of course that too 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:20.520
 We may need to retrieve this again 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.750
 a hash map and i write now 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:28.680
 first of all and then I'll explain you 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:35.210
 Bigger little character drinks in the stack 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:37.500
 klamauk long to inventor is equal to new 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.199
 bigger small sign clear on bracket 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.120
 to us with cabbage and my mobile phone rings 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:45.269
 and now we import hash first 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:50.269
 map and then items tech and herold.at 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:55.140
 point inventory so this is an app 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:57.210
 an eschment that can give you a string 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.239
 or an empty chair or something 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.710
 a whole store and one 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.059
 Related will be here now 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.040
 then just do a string 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.140
 then just the player name ear and 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.030
 to an item stack we have 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.520
 Simply inventory you can call him 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.140
 call me so hans but to 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.840
 for the sake of clarity similar 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.390
 inventory and that's just a new age 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.920
 So with a new schmidt go now 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:27.570
 we're under here and make his new 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:33.090
 commando fcm de.com points casey knorr 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:35.640
 case yes I think this reason 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.520
 command here with the command that must 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.750
 but if you like me you can do something 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.680
 Too fast machata then please in the 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.940
 comments because i can be bad 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.420
 assess whether I makes too fast 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:47.340
 or not 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:51.409
 and now we are writing essen.de short 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.460
 Knorr circle away, just go 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.409
 write my return chests again 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.250
 otherwise I forget that and now 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.770
 we write in there 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.370
 first time point cent message so we 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:07.429
 see you just once his message 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:09.179
 Inventory became loud exclamation point 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:10.560
 now we must, of course, but the 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.030
 things in the inventory has in this 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.750
 add cache memory 1 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:19.360
 Inventor i could so we just lay down 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.890
 what in the cash map and here you see 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:26.110
 already string and items cover like it 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:29.110
 have indicated above indeed a string 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:33.239
 let's take the player name buy.at nejm 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:36.069
 and get inventory as a stack point 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:39.400
 seeded contents here it is 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:40.660
 item stack so that works yes 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.370
 Of course we want this now too 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:48.209
 delete that at all 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:48.209
 Effect has b.net inventory point 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.739
 and semicolon so that's now need 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.750
 Of course we have that one weather 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.910
 Let's have a look at where these are 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:05.680
 Business clip ends on writing 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:10.180
 including 100 rose 0 case pick then 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:12.670
 again my nice return to and point 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:17.190
 cent message i know i like it it is 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:21.910
 always first here you have yours 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:23.799
 inventory inventory again exclamation mark 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.829
 and now of course we have the 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:29.950
 player to give convincing yes to 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:31.840
 we describe items tech the brace 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.579
 on really brace too i call it 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.290
 now just content as I said 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:36.850
 Here could call hans as you 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.340
 but want to have clarity 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.110
 I always want something to stop it 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.359
 fits and now we have to, of course 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.160
 but the stuff from the hash more 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:47.650
 To do this we will give an inventor 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.769
 ii So how depeche mode is called and then 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.510
 go take a point 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:54.100
 then he just got the one 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.290
 and that in the case 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.329
 the contents and now we have the 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.109
 Now we have the contens we have 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:02.700
 have played 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:06.459
 saved in contens video and 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:08.019
 now.de inventory point set contents 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.359
 and here shows us already 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:13.690
 nice to content so we have 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:18.970
 implemented and that's now make the 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:21.570
 insert plug in y el 1 2 3 4 5 1 235 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:34.310
 of the ribs 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:42.840
 less and you / save and 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:46.650
 export finish and reloaded and we 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:48.540
 see no error message perfect where 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:52.080
 here no error messages, we see ourselves 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:54.810
 the same in the video and see the same as 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.860
 we just give 1/11 intro and we 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:00.120
 see into the smallest wants and we give 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.040
 Just like that, yes I have a bit 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.730
 tingle inventory now we go one 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:10.460
 away and then he tucked inventory 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:12.300
 sees everything is gone and now pick in 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.040
 and our inventory 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:17.010
 here you have an inventory again everything 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:19.560
 of course it works again 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:21.540
 not with armor that is on the ear 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.310
 contents then just creates one 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.540
 pain and then take the ear 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.340
 that's exactly what you could do yourself 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:28.620
 We take hash 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:32.400
 map that's called her on the ear instead 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:33.090
 inventory and then where did we get away 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.290
 have made 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:38.250
 because you can just write in because 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:41.040
 I have to stand when I can do that 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:46.010
 You can then turn the pulpit 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:50.010
 write in armor dot point comma 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:53.340
 inventory point goes on the ear contens so 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:55.590
 what the institution has and then 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:57.930
 when you get that you can then yourself 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.820
 find out but I guess with the 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:02.100
 first example should actually now 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:05.610
 good if you know how 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:09.210
 the stowage is ok and yes what ideas 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:11.700
 I could show you know writing 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.230
 the comments and yes in case I agree 

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:14.640
 fast in what makes you write me 

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:15.330
 too bitter because i can do it so well 

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.760
 judge 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:18.870
 and yes , I want to say that's good 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.200
 see you next time 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.200
 pure skin
