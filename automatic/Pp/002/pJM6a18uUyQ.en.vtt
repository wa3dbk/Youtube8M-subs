00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.499
 it's very good youtube wanted that 

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:05.000
 commenting today I bring you a gameplay of 

00:00:03.499 --> 00:00:06.620
 finally the battlefield hard line 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.350
 I play this week during the week so 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.760
 here you have an initial streak that 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:12.890
 says on this map I do not remember how it 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.400
 call but I do not know I started to distribute as 

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:18.470
 a madman took the m4 16 and then I took the 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.720
 76 3 I do not know what it's called 36 is not the 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.430
 light soil is these that can be 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.680
 see on the map and is that I get to 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.119
 kill like crazy is a streak of 16 and 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.400
 just good I took the bag so that 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.810
 I wanted to take in a car to be able to be and 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.039
 it kills me fit an uncle who was alive in 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.480
 the area that I just killed that but 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:33.800
 well you'll see the truth is pretty 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.379
 well because in these first moments 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.620
 when good is the first start of 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:40.940
 starting match better said 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.019
 normally on this map you start to 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.309
 give of hosts here the whole world the 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:44.569
 gas station not because this is where it is 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:45.729
 the money of such I was dedicating myself 

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:47.749
 to cover while the companions 

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:49.100
 they tried to carry the bags but it is that 

00:00:47.749 --> 00:00:50.749
 will start to come the car started to 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.489
 come policemen and scheme of me have 

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:54.170
 been playing as a thief to steal the 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.510
 capital there are you see as the companions in 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.829
 remove it and then tried to cover what 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.089
 I can not is that the truth that made me 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:00.469
 all the time plus I have a 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:04.129
 precision I do not know I'm quite surprised 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:05.840
 good with the tail m 416 since good not 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.280
 I have no accessory removed in this 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.490
 moment I think I have 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.350
 and now I have a compensator I think 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.760
 because I did not know up and I 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.900
 would miss is to block me at an angle 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.549
 I like it a lot but how good 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.170
 I'll have it in a little bit so it's good 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:19.990
 Well, this example I have commented 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.729
 obviously it's not a gameplay 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.200
 Well, in digital, you have to see a little 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.490
 on the subject of how they go on Sundays 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.200
 As you see, I think it's going 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.700
 pretty good thing and also say no 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.500
 I'm alone in this video but good of 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.180
 moment is this initial recipe and then 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.190
 I'm going to leave a gameplay practically 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.630
 Whole I played also on another map 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.460
 that when as a thief and we get 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.289
 win pretty fast with a game 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.759
 quite movidita not then that 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:41.810
 say that for the next week 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:42.890
 It is also safer that I bring you a 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.539
 lie of this game playing with 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.250
 surely complicated with Pablo with 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:47.600
 not even this afternoon we are going to play a 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.369
 ratillo so good of 6 that yesterday 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.659
 I was in poquillo live killing and 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:52.819
 such that I was given a little bad because 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.190
 we were each ring alone and obviously 

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:57.380
 when you play alone with a partner 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.149
 who plays in teams on the other side and is 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.460
 a lot so this moment is not I take the 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:03.080
 mgm this weapon kills a lot I do not know 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.300
 how it gives so much in the coges of the ground and 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.340
 such a killer of 23 bullets in an overrun 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.780
 it moves almost and well here is the time 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.429
 in which I now in the frame say that 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.709
 I 'm going next third I'll take out the buap 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.970
 here you know and well I keep on killing 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.740
 here I think one comes 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.930
 had someone picked up the bag I'm going to 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.330
 kill him there was a pica that kill him 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.400
 killed him and here is something to the left of 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.860
 Suddenly I see three guys see as you 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.120
 killed one killed the second and the one that 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.630
 he had left touched he thought he 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.630
 I had killed 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.650
 that's where the bastard kills me so good 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.210
 here the march is cut will see if it is 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.710
 a streak 16 but super fast and has not 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.360
 been has been practically in two 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.950
 something like that to be battlefield 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.900
 is very good and good this map is 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.250
 here the marijuana plantation and here 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.050
 I tried to take the bag and here you will see 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.220
 It is subject to the end that played and 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.870
 carrying a little lost 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.790
 diego I like a shortcut to see if I can 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.040
 go up the stairs because the point 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.600
 I had it here right above and then 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.340
 sure there are some stairs around here and 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.930
 well suddenly here they give me the cad out 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.090
 Pablo tells me that one comes from behind 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.440
 I turn I blow him but half of me 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.120
 bust you will not see it anymore and from 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.620
 here because the game is not going well enough 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.020
 normal way not here is when he tells me 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.490
 I kill him and my uncle kills me super fast 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.990
 true but good we kill them crazy to the 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.000
 time something that happens to me a little weird the 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.470
 final battle double ko and such but good 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.820
 there you have a background example and let's go 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.350
 talk a little about the subject of 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.660
 not on Sundays and all that 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.440
 I do not always know that there are people who do not 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.600
 like there are people who love 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.130
 lately for example it had to be 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.840
 a game of weapons of the counter is liked 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.670
 a lot also does not like much 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.860
 battlefield lately in plants 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.690
 against zombies like pretty I'm going to 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.040
 also incorporate the believe that the 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.989
 next week or the next 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.700
 mortal kombat x that is a game that I 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:33.140
 I played in my childhood and I loved 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.849
 very much I played the deadly kombat 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.769
 old I do not know if it was in an emulator of 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:38.390
 pc like the one played that but it's me 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:39.830
 I loved and I loved the mortal 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.810
 kombat and well, I'm really looking forward 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.450
 to buy me the new one because the previous one 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.920
 to the deadly 9 kombat when it did not go up 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.750
 videos if I'm not wrong if I played 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.700
 I quite liked having a few 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.280
 very very bunk combos has never gone up 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.569
 fighting games to the channel as well as 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.190
 example of cars that I do not like 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.540
 fighting games there are little that I 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.670
 like for example the dragon ball is and 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.470
 I like that he included it in the list of 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.000
 the vote that by the way you can vote 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.260
 the game that you like most in the 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.610
 description for you to keep them week 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.950
 that is coming and I tell you that you can upload 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:10.549
 battlefield hard line in life and also 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.170
 apart I'm going to upload the game that 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:13.910
 you choose yourselves and I tell you dragon ball 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.170
 it's a little shop where it does not 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.910
 too much because as you know how I am 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.079
 butt with the channel with the theme of the call 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.549
 of duty with harrah's warfare and such 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.229
 because obviously I am forced to 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.880
 play to take videos but not when 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:24.350
 they have free time for a little while and 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.450
 so I like to clear myself as a type 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.170
 of games and that's why supposedly the 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:29.990
 Sundays 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:32.060
 the channel that you are not going to find call of 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.830
 duty behind warfare or other steps in 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.200
 the channel because it's that from time to time 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.910
 I do not like it, I like to clear less than 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.280
 yes I like capital but all the 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:43.100
 days playing every day at the end you can 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.350
 get tired and that's why in the 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.390
 night as I say at the time of no 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.040
 upload videos if not after playing what 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:50.900
 better is the variety is not good that 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.190
 this day playing the same game for 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.300
 example is what I do not like 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.790
 Many times from you too 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.260
 what are you going to do practically 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:58.940
 three years when he talks to the two 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.530
 kids there are more games and I do not say that 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.390
 be more here the wiki but you can 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.060
 four types of funniest games already 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:07.550
 be of xbox of play or of nintendo 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.320
 there are even many games to pass the 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.970
 while some fifa are not many 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.770
 things there are people who do know that they play 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.030
 a lot of games and such but all 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.800
 they are playing all day and to be going 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:18.980
 play for the whole day playing as 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:21.230
 it is called the two total and good then no 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:23.360
 I know maybe it 's to walk around playing 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:24.860
 many games at a time, not all of them there 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.660
 It is already evident that every day 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.250
 you can play the games yo then that as 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:30.350
 I feel a bit forced to play here guti 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.240
 Well, I have to play it obviously, if not 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.650
 I would like it, I would not play it but it's 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.270
 love the caldén warfare 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.460
 but I like to go from time to time 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.540
 changing and well then for example I can 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.370
 if you are curious I am playing 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:42.410
 pretty good now not so much because 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:45.440
 when I was traveling to where yes that 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:47.330
 I played pretty monster hunter the 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.289
 new from our people 4 what happens that 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.030
 I can not upload it because I do not have 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:52.220
 capturadora d &amp; s plus I bought the 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.330
 3ds new so well I have no way 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:55.789
 to upload it but I have a character 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.199
 pretty cheto the truth and well then 

00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:59.060
 what I like to play 

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:00.199
 practically the type of games what 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.030
 you ask me the ones I like the most 

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:03.500
 obviously they are the shooter but I 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:06.110
 love the rpg that is the problem of 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.669
 RPGs of role-playing games that 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.990
 the time to go up to the channel does not make me 

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:10.940
 too much grace for example so that what 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.889
 you know that many do not know my 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:14.930
 favorite games are the onimusha and there 

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:17.780
 because good löning using several of them 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:19.639
 the 2 the 3 and the 4 I love the new what 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:21.410
 I played a lot but good for those who 

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:23.030
 you ask my name the channel comes from 

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:25.010
 there shock and not the animus to 4 I like it 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:26.960
 much my favorite game is the dragon 

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:29.960
 quest 8 many trunks I like but the 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:31.340
 8 I love it so well that's not why 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.500
 that goes up on Sundays another kind of 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:35.389
 games because I love to also play 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.099
 other games I also think that to the 

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:38.599
 time to rest both me and you 

00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:40.310
 it's better and instead of creating a channel 

00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:42.740
 secondary because I see that today 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:44.900
 is receiving with a lot of desire like that 

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.580
 so far this video of battlefield 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.110
 kids there you have the final score not 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:50.000
 It's a mega game but with the run of 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.260
 before that complements very well so 

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.630
 I liked it, I would not have died 

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:56.110
 I liked favorites I wrote more week 

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:56.110
 goodbye
