00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
instead of drawing that arrow I can

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.380 
instead of drawing that arrow I can
import<00:00:52.050> this<00:00:52.289> one<00:00:52.469> here<00:00:52.860> I<00:00:52.980> can<00:00:53.579> also<00:00:53.940> modify

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.940 
great feature that storyboard Pro allows
me<00:01:52.240> to<00:01:52.390> do<00:01:52.539> that<00:01:52.720> is<00:01:52.840> not<00:01:52.869> possible<00:01:53.319> on<00:01:53.710> paper

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
me to do that is not possible on paper

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.510 
me to do that is not possible on paper
is<00:01:54.159> the<00:01:54.310> animatic<00:01:54.939> for<00:01:55.770> that<00:01:56.770> I'll<00:01:57.009> need<00:01:57.490> to

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
is the animatic for that I'll need to

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.770 
is the animatic for that I'll need to
open<00:01:57.880> a<00:01:57.970> new<00:01:58.000> project

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.960 

this<00:02:02.710> storyboard<00:02:03.190> is<00:02:03.340> the<00:02:03.460> story<00:02:03.700> of<00:02:03.850> the

pig the trees and any other drawing in
the<00:02:10.810> storyboard<00:02:11.260> were<00:02:11.470> all<00:02:11.709> done<00:02:12.010> in<00:02:12.160> this

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
the storyboard were all done in this

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.630 
the storyboard were all done in this
software<00:02:13.350> also<00:02:14.350> I<00:02:14.980> was<00:02:15.250> talking<00:02:15.580> about

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
software also I was talking about

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.030 
software also I was talking about
animatic<00:02:16.480> one<00:02:17.020> of<00:02:17.110> the<00:02:17.230> great<00:02:17.410> features<00:02:17.650> is

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
animatic one of the great features is

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.190 
animatic one of the great features is
camera<00:02:18.400> motion<00:02:18.790> I<00:02:18.940> can<00:02:19.209> easily<00:02:19.660> add<00:02:19.989> the

camera motion I can easily add the

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.110 
camera motion I can easily add the
