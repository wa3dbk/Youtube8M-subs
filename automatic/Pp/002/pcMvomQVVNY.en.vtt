00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.600
 Hmm 

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.600
 Have 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.600
 Hmm 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.509
 Hmm 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.509
 Four days 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:22.130
 Just one example 1 Toichochoi of 

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:25.369
 Let's play with handmade toys one by one every day 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.000
 We are pleased to introduce you to chestnut toys 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:31.289
 Easy to make 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.289
 It is a slightly unusual handmade picture book 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.289
 Hmm 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:45.180
 This book is not a paper picture book 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:52.180
 Make using a commercial album 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:55.380
 So you don't have to book, so anyone can make a book easily 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:01:01.450
 In addition, because the album sheet is transparent 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:04.960
 You can create a fun picture book that changes the picture when piling up Heiji 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:07.900
 Magic book for adults and children alike 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:13.890
 So let's try to make immediately 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.890
 I used animal stickers in this example 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:25.100
 The base of the picture book is a transparent album of a type in which the picture is sandwiched between the stickers 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:28.490
 Let's make the background of the picture book first 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:31.570
 Get into the size of the album 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.620
 I put it in a sheet 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:38.060
 Light blue is empty 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:45.760
 Yellow green is meadow orange is sunset 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:49.980
 Black can be expressed easily because it can be expressed with a sheet of paper such as night eggs 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:55.910
 Put a sticker on the animal when you have a background 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:55.910
 Let's complete the picture while Imagine your story various 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.330
 Sea took 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.500
 Not put drawing paper on which is in the background 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:06.659
 You can enjoy the alternative to put a sticker 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.250
 For example this scene 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:12.060
 And turn the zebra of page 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:15.210
 I went to Ogishi Ito 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.190
 Put a seal of zebra on the last 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:23.760
 I was hiding 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:25.730
 It is fun to devise various ideas making use of the feature of the transparent sheet that the picture below shows through 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:30.319
 you know 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:38.349
 Depending a little bit different transparent sheet is a paper of this 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:38.349
 Please try by all means because small children can be made if you use stickers 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.310
 me 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.840
