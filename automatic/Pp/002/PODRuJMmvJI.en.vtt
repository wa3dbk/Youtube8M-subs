00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.020
 music please 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.230
 hello everyone and welcome to a chapter 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.540
 more than the idea of ​​a vegan greets them 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.119
 with great pleasure and you are rodríguez 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.130
 the theme of today will be vegan diet 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:21.039
 so as not to decompensate, there are some 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.140
 people who are making the decision and 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:24.880
 are in the transition to change their 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.580
 dietary habits to a diet or 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.440
 Vegan lifestyle or even 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.750
 vegetarian and today I have them 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.870
 prepared that topic so that they are not 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.370
 compensate for being vegetarian vegans 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.170
 because if I received comments I 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.570
 I had a friend who became a vegetarian him 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.030
 the first one fell unconscious 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.769
 question that I get when I 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.170
 I tell someone that I have this style 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:49.929
 of life is and how it replaces the meat 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:52.359
 that is a question that I like 

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:54.519
 tell them that I do not need to substitute 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:56.429
 what are the reasons very well we 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:01:01.199
 we are human bodies that we are 

00:00:56.429 --> 00:01:03.519
 organ and bowel compounds 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.010
 many more things we always 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:08.409
 we have heard the phrase is what 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.750
 you eat very well the food that you give to 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:13.950
 your body goes through your organs and you 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:17.399
 bloodstream and practically 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.369
 in you so what you give will be good 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:22.590
 the digestion process of us the 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.500
 Human begins with the mouth and saliva 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.630
 our alkaline saliva is not made 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.689
 for decomposing animal flesh the 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.579
 carnivores have acid saliva the acid 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.770
 Hydrochloric is essential to digest 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.229
 corpses are secreted in our stomach 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.780
 in such quantities and in stomach of the 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.740
 carnivores secretes that substance ten 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.710
 times greater 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.869
 our kidneys liver and colon are 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.369
 poorly equipped to digest animal flesh 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.099
 compared to carnivores 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.959
 our intestines are too long 

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:56.099
 so the food that is not processed 

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:58.110
 correctly it gets stuck there 

00:01:56.099 --> 00:02:00.899
 people who say I do not eat red meat 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.390
 but sometimes like chicken and animals 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:06.209
 are confined to buildings in the 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.459
 that the cages are too tight 

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:10.560
 They can not open their wings or their 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.049
 legs and his body is taken in the 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.170
 metal mesh and that causes that 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:18.420
 peak has each other which it makes 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.490
 cut their picks with knives 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.470
 hot cattle subject to burns 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.200
 third grade to mark it the pigs 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.600
 they also suffer brand and castration in addition 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.640
 of mutilation of ears tails and teeth 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.950
 everyone lives in their own society 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.110
 urine stools and vomit with wounds 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.500
 infected to keep the animals 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.850
 alive in these conditions so 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.890
 disgusting the farmers should give them 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.450
 regular doses of antibiotics a 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.370
 study of the university of berkeley in 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.290
 california links to infections 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.630
 the urinary tracts in women with 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.400
 the consumption of animal meat of what 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.040
 that is in the flesh is not very 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.890
 funny giordano hexachlorobenzene 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:59.310
 dichloro diphenyl trichloroethane dieldrin 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.720
 dioxin heptachlor indar no bon appétit 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.210
 that's why the consumption of meat has 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.400
 linked with cancer disorders 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.770
 reproductive liver kidneys lungs 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.900
 birth defects abortions 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.420
 Spontaneous and system disorders 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.640
 nervous I think I do not need to replace 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.830
 that plants absorb the energy of the 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.020
 sun and we get it by eating them 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.120
 all that light and energy is transmitted to 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.250
 our body is a gift 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.769
 of nature your whole body is being 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.170
 regenerating every day all 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:30.209
 time so what you give him are the 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.400
 new cells that are going to be born those that 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.560
 they are dying and they were left in history 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.629
 and those that are born need the 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.610
 new gasoline new enzyme new 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:41.310
 nutrients to be able to grow to be able 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.989
 create new cells then it is very 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.909
 important the quality of nutrients 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.819
 that you want them to be converted 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:49.530
 in its next cells that yes the fruit 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:52.379
 fresh is much better than all the 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.329
 that you can find canned and etcetera 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:57.239
 because because fresh fruit and 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:59.250
 raw vegetables have life that then 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:00.239
 they say we kill fruits and 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.400
 vegetables 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:05.340
 but that life is energy from the plants 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.170
 they are nutrients enzymes and phytochemicals 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.209
 the enzymes are biochemical factors that 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.870
 we need to survive are 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:14.489
 vital for breathing digestion 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.650
 reproduction and functioning of the DNA and 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:18.780
 the rn then how do we give our 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.630
 body to all those enzymes well fruit 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.940
 especially the banana papaya pineapple and 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.460
 raw or slightly vegetable mango 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:29.550
 boiled nuts and wheat seeds 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.710
 garlic algae and legumes and well there they are 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.259
 the answer is what you eat there is a 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.060
 difference between decompensation and 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:37.530
 healing crisis because in people to 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.780
 Sometimes you feel weak when you do it 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:42.870
 vegetarian or vegan i tell you that they fall 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:45.120
 in the stage of the quesadillas not as 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.759
 meat then I go to the tacos with the 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.470
 friends and I fall in the quesadillas and not 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:51.840
 I know what to prepare to eat because 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.819
 normally we do not have a cookbook to the 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.550
 vegetarian hand when we take the 

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:59.970
 decision then we fall into the tortilla 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:03.630
 the bread and instead of being vegetarian 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:06.150
 vegetable we believe in bread is good for 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:09.300
 feel good in this kind of style of 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:12.090
 life nor are you eating like that of fruits and 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:15.030
 raw vegetables decompensation when 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:17.310
 your body does not receive the calories that 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.590
 you are spending while you give him the 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:21.780
 energy that the body needs 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.500
 to work well you will not feel 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.690
 wrong 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:27.330
 apart you need to enrich all this 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:31.199
 type of diets with legumes like 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:32.040
 beans or also oatmeal rice and I 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:34.290
 agreement that in primary 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.690
 when you could not open a juice or not 

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:39.530
 you could push a bank move a 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:42.780
 desk whatever you did not eat 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:44.910
 beans or beans or something similar 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:47.430
