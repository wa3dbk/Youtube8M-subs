00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:12.469
 the sum of two numbers is 106 and the largest 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:15.380
 exceeds the child in 8 find sayings 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:18.230
 numbers first you have to translate the 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.720
 enunciated and for this one speaks of two 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.939
 numbers we do not know if they are equal good 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.460
 in fact here it says that one exceeds another 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.950
 then they are different therefore 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.279
 you have to set the start 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.780
 numbers let's put x and x though you can 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.230
 be any other type of letter or 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.590
 drawing symbol and says that one is older 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:42.860
 that another one we are going to suppose that x is 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:45.500
 greater than and now translating says the 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:50.990
 sum of two numbers then it is translated 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:55.490
 as x plus the sum of 106 and the greatest 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:58.010
 exceeds the minor is to say that the greater if 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.510
 the less is subtracted the result goes to 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.820
 be 8 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:05.479
 that means it exceeds or we can also 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.650
 say that the minor plus 8 equals x to the 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.530
 final account will be one 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.000
 very similar equation find sayings 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.400
 numbers 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.590
 of this system two by two because there are 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.650
 two equations and two unknowns is already 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:21.830
 everything ordered and it is appreciated that the 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.660
 second term is equal adding and in 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:27.350
 the next one is the same but subtracting 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:30.619
 then it is ideal to apply the 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:34.580
 method of reduction or addition and subtraction as 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:36.619
 it is called which we are going to use 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.260
 then this procedure what it says 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:42.080
 is if you have a variable with the same 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:45.200
 amount but of the opposite sign you have to 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:50.720
 add vertically then xx is 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:55.630
 2x + y - it is done 0 or canceled and in the 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:58.180
 case of the numbers would come 114 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.090
 and from here then you get to the 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.759
 conclusion that twice the X is 114 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.070
 therefore to clear nothing else the 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:09.580
 value of 1 is divided by 2 in both 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:15.670
 sides and it is concluded that an X is 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:18.370
 equal to 114 between 2 half of 5 of 100 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:23.860
 of 50 and half of 14 is 7 so this 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:28.780
 is equal to 57 therefore if x equals 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:32.860
 to 57 and the second equation is 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:38.230
 concludes that the difference is 8 is to say 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:40.750
 where it says x we â€‹â€‹can replace 57 to 57 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.390
 we take away a number and it should give 8 good 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:48.730
 there are several ways to do this we can 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:51.520
 clear and just leave 57 8 this 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:54.760
 is subtracting is sent home adding 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:57.010
 and this + 8 is canceled and sent from 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:02.610
 left side 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.610
 the difference is 57 we removed 8 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:10.300
 49 either logically or by clearing 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.800
 of some of the equations can be 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.970
 anyone can take the first and 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.250
 the second one I think I get the most 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.430
 complicated because in the first era 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:21.430
 simply put 57 more than number 206 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:25.330
 but good to choose the second and the end 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:30.840
 you get to the same result that is already 49 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:30.840
 and the largest number that is x is 57
