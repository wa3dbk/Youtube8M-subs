00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:54.890 
I've been in love with it for as long as
I<00:03:52.380> can<00:03:52.440> remember<00:03:52.560> and<00:03:53.180> every<00:03:54.180> year<00:03:54.209> I<00:03:54.450> have<00:03:54.780> to

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
I can remember and every year I have to

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.599 
I can remember and every year I have to
replay<00:03:55.049> it<00:03:55.260> every<00:03:55.769> year<00:03:55.950> I<00:03:56.010> find<00:03:56.280> something

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609 
replay it every year I find something

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:58.220 
replay it every year I find something
new<00:03:56.790> and<00:03:57.060> interesting<00:03:57.299> about<00:03:57.750> it<00:03:57.810> there's

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
new and interesting about it there's

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.780 
new and interesting about it there's
there's<00:03:58.560> just<00:03:58.769> so<00:03:58.919> much<00:03:59.069> there<00:03:59.340> and<00:03:59.579> then

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
there's just so much there and then

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.539 
there's just so much there and then
there's<00:04:00.239> like<00:04:00.599> layers<00:04:01.470> upon<00:04:01.739> layers<00:04:01.919> of<00:04:02.250> death

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
there's like layers upon layers of death

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:05.479 
there's like layers upon layers of death
I've<00:04:03.239> seen<00:04:03.510> people<00:04:03.660> who<00:04:04.290> have<00:04:04.560> likened<00:04:05.310> the

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
I've seen people who have likened the

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:07.190 
I've seen people who have likened the
entire<00:04:05.790> thing<00:04:05.819> to<00:04:06.419> going<00:04:06.780> through<00:04:06.930> the<00:04:06.989> stages

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
entire thing to going through the stages

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.720 
entire thing to going through the stages
of<00:04:07.319> grief<00:04:07.440> I've<00:04:08.280> seen<00:04:08.549> people<00:04:10.160> discuss<00:04:11.160> like

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
of grief I've seen people discuss like

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.520 
of grief I've seen people discuss like
just<00:04:12.060> the<00:04:12.180> intricacy<00:04:12.720> of<00:04:12.750> the<00:04:12.840> design<00:04:13.169> and<00:04:13.410> how

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
just the intricacy of the design and how

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.319 
just the intricacy of the design and how
every<00:04:13.859> single<00:04:13.889> thing<00:04:14.250> leads<00:04:14.760> into<00:04:14.940> every

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
every single thing leads into every

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:16.530 
every single thing leads into every
other<00:04:15.450> single<00:04:15.810> thing<00:04:16.140> with

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 
other single thing with

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.770 
other single thing with
game<00:04:16.690> world<00:04:17.020> and<00:04:17.340> it's<00:04:18.340> it's<00:04:18.700> all<00:04:19.030> just<00:04:19.480> so

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
game world and it's it's all just so

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.870 
game world and it's it's all just so
elegantly<00:04:20.350> put<00:04:20.560> together<00:04:20.890> the<00:04:21.460> easy<00:04:21.700> answer

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
elegantly put together the easy answer

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.050 
elegantly put together the easy answer
probably<00:04:22.570> just<00:04:22.900> from<00:04:23.440> a<00:04:23.650> longevity

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
probably just from a longevity

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.720 
probably just from a longevity
standpoint<00:04:25.060> is<00:04:25.500> megaman<00:04:26.500> 2<00:04:26.800> but<00:04:27.100> I<00:04:27.250> don't

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
standpoint is megaman 2 but I don't

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.430 
standpoint is megaman 2 but I don't
actually<00:04:28.030> think<00:04:28.330> I<00:04:28.600> played<00:04:28.840> it<00:04:29.050> at<00:04:29.170> all<00:04:29.320> in

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
actually think I played it at all in

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:35.700 
actually think I played it at all in
2012<00:04:30.370> so<00:04:32.220> these<00:04:33.220> days<00:04:33.760> it's<00:04:34.330> it's<00:04:35.170> probably

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
2012 so these days it's it's probably

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.340 
2012 so these days it's it's probably
cave<00:04:36.130> story<00:04:36.460> I<00:04:36.700> think<00:04:37.090> that's<00:04:37.720> it's<00:04:38.110> a<00:04:38.200> game

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:38.350 
cave story I think that's it's a game

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.550 
cave story I think that's it's a game
with<00:04:38.530> such<00:04:38.860> depth<00:04:39.750> and<00:04:40.750> it's<00:04:41.080> it's<00:04:41.380> so

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
with such depth and it's it's so

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.680 
with such depth and it's it's so
enjoyable<00:04:41.740> to<00:04:42.370> plan<00:04:42.580> I<00:04:42.670> love<00:04:42.700> the<00:04:43.090> story<00:04:43.420> and

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
enjoyable to plan I love the story and

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.530 
enjoyable to plan I love the story and
the<00:04:43.720> characters<00:04:43.810> so<00:04:44.560> much<00:04:44.770> that<00:04:45.180> that<00:04:46.180> I<00:04:46.210> could

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 
the characters so much that that I could

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.280 
the characters so much that that I could
keep<00:04:46.750> being<00:04:47.710> happy<00:04:47.830> to<00:04:48.220> go<00:04:48.310> back<00:04:48.520> to<00:04:48.790> it<00:04:48.940> and<00:04:49.030> I

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
keep being happy to go back to it and I

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.260 
keep being happy to go back to it and I
it's<00:04:50.290> not<00:04:50.530> a<00:04:50.590> game<00:04:50.860> that<00:04:51.070> I<00:04:51.190> could<00:04:51.370> play<00:04:51.610> like<00:04:51.970> I

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
it's not a game that I could play like I

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.790 
it's not a game that I could play like I
just<00:04:52.510> finished<00:04:52.810> it<00:04:52.990> now<00:04:53.260> i'm<00:04:53.380> going<00:04:53.500> to<00:04:53.560> start

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
just finished it now i'm going to start

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.610 
just finished it now i'm going to start
all<00:04:53.950> over<00:04:53.980> again<00:04:54.340> but<00:04:55.000> about<00:04:55.780> once<00:04:56.080> a<00:04:56.290> year<00:04:56.320> I

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620 
all over again but about once a year I

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.010 
all over again but about once a year I
get<00:04:56.830> that<00:04:57.160> itch<00:04:57.340> and<00:04:57.640> and<00:04:58.180> I<00:04:58.360> have<00:04:58.510> to<00:04:58.660> go<00:04:58.810> back

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
get that itch and and I have to go back

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.060 
get that itch and and I have to go back
and<00:04:59.350> try<00:05:00.280> something<00:05:00.610> new<00:05:00.940> or<00:05:01.710> trying<00:05:02.710> to<00:05:02.800> tempt

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070 
and try something new or trying to tempt

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:04.830 
and try something new or trying to tempt
hell<00:05:03.250> again<00:05:03.610> which<00:05:03.850> I<00:05:04.030> don't<00:05:04.180> think<00:05:04.750> that's

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
hell again which I don't think that's

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.380 
hell again which I don't think that's
ever<00:05:05.050> going<00:05:05.260> to<00:05:05.320> happen
