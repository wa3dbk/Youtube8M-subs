replenish the some of the things that

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.679 
replenish the some of the things that
have<00:01:10.590> been<00:01:10.619> taken<00:01:11.040> out<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.520> their<00:01:12.000> milk<00:01:12.270> during

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
the pasteurization process now why do we

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.640 
the pasteurization process now why do we
want<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.820> use<00:01:17.850> cultured<00:01:18.540> products<00:01:19.020> well<00:01:19.170> I've

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
want to use cultured products well I've

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.370 
want to use cultured products well I've
said<00:01:20.640> that<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:20.970> helps<00:01:21.509> with<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:22.020> friendly

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
said that it helps with the friendly

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.520 
said that it helps with the friendly
bacterias<00:01:23.009> but<00:01:23.720> there's<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.810> lot<00:01:25.049> of<00:01:25.200> people

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
bacterias but there's a lot of people

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.010 
bacterias but there's a lot of people
who<00:01:25.680> truly<00:01:26.009> have<00:01:26.549> problems<00:01:27.240> digesting

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
who truly have problems digesting

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.219 
who truly have problems digesting
pasteurized<00:01:28.920> milk<00:01:29.150> it's<00:01:30.150> because<00:01:30.630> there's<00:01:30.960> so

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
pasteurized milk it's because there's so

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.859 
pasteurized milk it's because there's so
much<00:01:31.729> lactose<00:01:32.729> in<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.210> pasteurized<00:01:33.750> milk

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
much lactose in the pasteurized milk

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.550 
much lactose in the pasteurized milk
lactose<00:01:34.380> is<00:01:34.920> milk<00:01:35.340> sugar<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:36.030> our<00:01:36.689> system

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
lactose is milk sugar and our system

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.670 
lactose is milk sugar and our system
doesn't<00:01:37.920> digest<00:01:38.490> it<00:01:38.970> well<00:01:39.049> raw<00:01:40.049> milk<00:01:40.439> actually

we're getting heat it to a hundred and

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.900 
we're getting heat it to a hundred and
ten<00:03:14.269> degrees<00:03:15.070> there's<00:03:16.070> also<00:03:16.310> different

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
ten degrees there's also different

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.690 
ten degrees there's also different

introduce the culture one of the methods

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.660 
introduce the culture one of the methods
is<00:03:22.850> to<00:03:23.329> actually<00:03:23.600> use<00:03:23.900> a<00:03:24.140> commercial<00:03:24.950> yogurt

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
cycle going then you just use about a

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.120 
cycle going then you just use about a
half<00:03:47.120> a<00:03:47.420> cup<00:03:47.600> of<00:03:47.810> your<00:03:47.930> last<00:03:48.139> batch<00:03:48.530> and<00:03:48.859> put<00:03:48.889> it

into<00:03:49.370> your<00:03:49.489> next<00:03:49.670> batch<00:03:49.910> so<00:03:50.090> that<00:03:50.209> feeds<00:03:50.660> the

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
into your next batch so that feeds the

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.690 
into your next batch so that feeds the
culture<00:03:51.380> it<00:03:51.530> puts<00:03:51.799> it<00:03:51.950> in<00:03:52.069> there<00:03:52.280> and<00:03:52.459> it<00:03:52.609> will

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
culture it puts it in there and it will

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.039 
culture it puts it in there and it will
continue<00:03:53.060> to<00:03:53.209> grow<00:03:53.510> into<00:03:53.840> your<00:03:53.959> next<00:03:54.139> batch<00:03:54.380> I

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
continue to grow into your next batch I

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:00.699 
continue to grow into your next batch I
purchase<00:03:57.049> a<00:03:58.569> actual<00:03:59.569> culture<00:03:59.870> it's<00:04:00.290> it's<00:04:00.590> a

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
purchase a actual culture it's it's a

purchase a actual culture it's it's a
powder<00:04:01.639> I<00:04:02.000> get<00:04:02.660> it<00:04:02.780> from

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
powder I get it from

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.069 
powder I get it from
it's<00:04:03.680> called<00:04:03.980> dairy<00:04:04.250> connection

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 
it's called dairy connection

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:08.559 
it's called dairy connection
incorporated<00:04:06.079> so<00:04:07.069> anyway<00:04:07.639> I'm<00:04:07.910> going<00:04:08.329> to
