you've<00:01:36.150> pretty<00:01:36.270> much<00:01:36.360> got<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.689> get<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.810> new

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
you've pretty much got to get a new

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.270 
you've pretty much got to get a new
battery<00:01:37.140> every<00:01:37.320> three<00:01:38.070> years<00:01:38.250> or<00:01:38.520> so

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.830 

which<00:01:42.280> is<00:01:42.430> why<00:01:42.580> I<00:01:42.640> phones<00:01:43.060> only<00:01:43.270> last<00:01:43.570> three

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
which is why I phones only last three

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.060 
which is why I phones only last three
years<00:01:44.020> and<00:01:44.230> you<00:01:44.320> got<00:01:44.410> to<00:01:44.440> throw<00:01:44.830> them<00:01:44.980> away

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
years and you got to throw them away

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.430 
years and you got to throw them away
right<00:01:45.760> but<00:01:46.630> they<00:01:46.720> can't<00:01:47.020> swap<00:01:47.260> with<00:01:47.380> the

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
right but they can't swap with the

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.290 
right but they can't swap with the
battery<00:01:47.710> Oh<00:01:47.820> or<00:01:48.820> I<00:01:48.850> suppose<00:01:48.910> you<00:01:49.180> could

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.300 
battery Oh or I suppose you could

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.060 
battery Oh or I suppose you could
probably<00:01:49.510> send<00:01:49.690> it<00:01:49.810> into<00:01:49.960> apple<00:01:50.560> right<00:01:50.950> and

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
probably send it into apple right and

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.050 
probably send it into apple right and
they<00:01:51.130> change<00:01:51.340> it<00:01:51.400> for<00:01:51.580> you<00:01:53.070> anyway<00:01:54.070> so<00:01:54.130> stick

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
they change it for you anyway so stick

00:05:17.809 --> 00:05:17.819 
would be one in a hundred I just a guess

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:19.279 
would be one in a hundred I just a guess
they'll<00:05:18.030> have<00:05:18.210> no<00:05:18.330> idea<00:05:18.569> it<00:05:18.690> would<00:05:18.780> be<00:05:18.930> five

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:19.289 
they'll have no idea it would be five

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:21.890 
they'll have no idea it would be five
percent<00:05:19.710> I<00:05:20.180> know<00:05:21.180> it's<00:05:21.330> a<00:05:21.360> lot<00:05:21.479> less<00:05:21.599> than<00:05:21.780> ten

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
percent I know it's a lot less than ten

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.980
