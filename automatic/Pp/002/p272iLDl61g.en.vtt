 [Music] 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.870
 you want to know the only dance that 

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:13.480
 danced to his sanctity Pope John Paul 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:16.290
 second in his visit to huelva then in the 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.290
 dance of the cable 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.860
 [Music] 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.360
 the dance of local goatherd is a dance 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.490
 who currently belongs to the brotherhood 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.620
 of san juan batista but the dance comes 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.690
 from remote times since when baked 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:31.270
 I was sitting in the area called the 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:33.330
 portichuelo that is to say more than 500 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.330
 years 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.150
 the dance is made up of 19 boards that are 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.130
 they go in pairs of two and the head that goes 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.870
 to have for that is odd I think that it 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.630
 dance with the heart more than physically 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.550
 because there are people that kids are 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.930
 athletes but others who do not and endure 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.920
 the four hours dancing without problem 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.920
 because simple dance 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.960
 the town goes whole and all the 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.710

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.180
