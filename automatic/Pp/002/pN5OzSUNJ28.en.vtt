00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
computer go a little bit faster that's

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.319 
computer go a little bit faster that's
why<00:01:26.159> it's<00:01:26.280> it's<00:01:26.850> looking<00:01:27.150> like<00:01:27.630> this<00:01:28.790> so<00:01:29.790> here

real<00:03:03.300> time<00:03:03.510> because<00:03:03.780> I'm<00:03:03.900> using<00:03:06.170> like<00:03:07.170> a<00:03:07.910> 36

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
bit computer mine's not really a good

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.410 
bit computer mine's not really a good
one<00:03:11.010> even<00:03:11.519> though<00:03:11.700> it's<00:03:11.820> a<00:03:11.880> Windows<00:03:12.150> 7<00:03:13.310> uh<00:03:14.420> so

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
one even though it's a Windows 7 uh so

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.620 
one even though it's a Windows 7 uh so
if<00:03:15.989> your<00:03:16.350> computer<00:03:16.830> is<00:03:17.100> that<00:03:17.459> good<00:03:18.030> with<00:03:18.329> the

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
if your computer is that good with the

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.860 
if your computer is that good with the
performance<00:03:19.290> you<00:03:19.470> should<00:03:19.500> click<00:03:20.070> real<00:03:20.370> time

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
performance you should click real time

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.420 
performance you should click real time
but<00:03:21.870> I<00:03:21.900> recommend<00:03:22.290> not<00:03:22.530> using<00:03:22.650> this<00:03:23.190> because

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
but I recommend not using this because

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.630 
but I recommend not using this because
this<00:03:23.790> will<00:03:24.180> let<00:03:25.019> your<00:03:25.200> computer<00:03:25.769> lag<00:03:26.130> a<00:03:26.400> lot

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
this will let your computer lag a lot

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.280 
this will let your computer lag a lot
and<00:03:26.940> your<00:03:27.390> game<00:03:27.660> it<00:03:27.840> will<00:03:27.989> only<00:03:28.140> be

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
and your game it will only be

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.770 
and your game it will only be
concentrating<00:03:29.040> on<00:03:29.070> your<00:03:29.250> game<00:03:29.870> so<00:03:32.720> so<00:03:33.720> you

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
concentrating on your game so so you

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.150 
concentrating on your game so so you
what<00:03:34.530> I<00:03:34.560> recommend<00:03:35.430> using<00:03:35.700> is<00:03:36.150> high<00:03:37.160> click

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
what I recommend using is high click

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.670 
what I recommend using is high click
Change<00:03:38.930> keep<00:03:39.930> this<00:03:40.079> minimized

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
Change keep this minimized

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.259 
Change keep this minimized
don't<00:03:40.829> take<00:03:41.010> this<00:03:41.160> out<00:03:43.340> go<00:03:44.340> on<00:03:44.370> to<00:03:44.579> your<00:03:44.730> game<00:03:44.910> I

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
don't take this out go on to your game I

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.240 
don't take this out go on to your game I
think<00:03:45.810> my<00:03:46.200> game<00:03:46.260> will<00:03:46.560> crash<00:03:46.739> because<00:03:47.160> it

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
think my game will crash because it

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.130 
think my game will crash because it
always<00:03:47.370> does<00:03:49.010> no<00:03:50.010> I<00:03:50.820> mean<00:03:51.750> my<00:03:51.930> minecraft

lagging<00:03:55.440> a<00:03:55.500> little<00:03:55.590> bit<00:03:55.829> because<00:03:56.040> that<00:03:56.459> means

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
lagging a little bit because that means

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.840 
lagging a little bit because that means
