facing<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.160> other<00:00:26.250> way<00:00:26.400> but<00:00:27.080> it's<00:00:28.080> basically

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
facing the other way but it's basically

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.009 
facing the other way but it's basically
just<00:00:28.880> it's<00:00:29.880> very<00:00:30.150> short<00:00:30.449> here<00:00:30.660> this<00:00:30.810> is<00:00:30.929> the

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
just it's very short here this is the

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.799 
just it's very short here this is the
shortest<00:00:31.349> bit<00:00:31.920> of<00:00:32.040> my<00:00:32.219> hair<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.700> then<00:00:32.880> it<00:00:33.000> it

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
shortest bit of my hair and then it it

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.380 
shortest bit of my hair and then it it
gradually<00:00:34.440> gets<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.860> little<00:00:35.010> bit<00:00:35.250> longer<00:00:35.489> so<00:00:36.239> if

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
gradually gets a little bit longer so if

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.590 
gradually gets a little bit longer so if
I<00:00:36.510> turn<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.930> side<00:00:37.550> you<00:00:38.550> can<00:00:38.730> see<00:00:38.760> if<00:00:39.270> I<00:00:39.390> like

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
I turn to the side you can see if I like

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.940 
I turn to the side you can see if I like
brush<00:00:39.989> it<00:00:40.170> up<00:00:41.660> it<00:00:42.660> gets<00:00:42.870> longer<00:00:43.520> so<00:00:44.520> up<00:00:44.640> here

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:45.950 
brush it up it gets longer so up here

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.110 
brush it up it gets longer so up here
it's<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:47.070> lot<00:00:47.219> longer<00:00:47.370> than<00:00:47.640> that<00:00:47.700> at<00:00:48.030> the

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
it's a lot longer than that at the

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.119 
it's a lot longer than that at the
bottom<00:00:48.390> so<00:00:48.510> it's<00:00:48.629> about<00:00:48.780> an<00:00:49.200> inch<00:00:49.469> long<00:00:49.890> I'd

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
bottom so it's about an inch long I'd

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.860 
bottom so it's about an inch long I'd
say<00:00:50.340> about<00:00:50.550> it<00:00:50.670> up<00:00:50.760> here<00:00:51.090> maybe<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.449> little<00:00:51.570> over

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.760 
an inch and here down here it's about a
centimeter<00:00:55.969> something<00:00:56.969> like<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.770> same

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
centimeter something like that and same

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.160 
centimeter something like that and same
thing<00:00:58.949> with<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.190> sides<00:00:59.579> they're<00:01:00.170> pretty

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
thing with the sides they're pretty

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.520

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.760 
here is about the same length as over
here<00:01:07.260> so<00:01:07.530> yeah<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:09.260> then<00:01:10.260> it<00:01:10.380> just<00:01:10.530> starts

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
here so yeah and then it just starts

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.969 
here so yeah and then it just starts
getting<00:01:10.890> longer<00:01:11.689> about<00:01:12.689> here<00:01:13.110> is<00:01:13.680> when<00:01:13.890> it

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
getting longer about here is when it

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.609 
getting longer about here is when it
starts<00:01:14.189> getting<00:01:14.280> longer<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:15.229> then<00:01:16.229> this<00:01:16.350> part

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
starts getting longer and then this part

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.830 
starts getting longer and then this part
here<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.040> about<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:18.060> want<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.360> say<00:01:18.450> an<00:01:18.570> inch<00:01:18.689> and

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
kind of paint not to maintain but to

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.850 
kind of paint not to maintain but to
style<00:01:36.600> um<00:01:36.960> there's<00:01:37.590> really<00:01:37.740> not<00:01:37.950> much<00:01:38.390> that<00:01:39.860> I

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
style um there's really not much that I

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.920 
style um there's really not much that I
have<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.100> do<00:01:41.430> this<00:01:41.759> part<00:01:42.060> here<00:01:42.390> is<00:01:42.600> pretty<00:01:42.780> much

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
have to do this part here is pretty much

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.410 
have to do this part here is pretty much
instantly<00:01:43.500> dry<00:01:43.890> once<00:01:44.220> I<00:01:44.369> run<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.549> towel<00:01:44.850> over<00:01:44.880> it

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
instantly dry once I run a towel over it

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.590 
instantly dry once I run a towel over it
and<00:01:46.520> the<00:01:47.520> top<00:01:47.729> you<00:01:48.149> know<00:01:48.240> takes<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.479> little

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
and the top you know takes a little

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.170 
and the top you know takes a little
longer<00:01:48.780> so<00:01:49.110> then<00:01:49.259> I<00:01:50.070> mentioned<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:50.729> just<00:01:50.909> like

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
longer so then I mentioned I just like

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.420 
longer so then I mentioned I just like
do<00:01:51.540> that<00:01:51.750> when<00:01:52.229> I<00:01:52.259> want<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.530> style<00:01:52.710> it<00:01:52.920> so<00:01:53.130> my

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
do that when I want to style it so my

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.969 
do that when I want to style it so my
hair<00:01:53.610> is<00:01:53.729> very<00:01:53.790> very<00:01:54.030> very<00:01:54.420> like<00:01:54.899> baby<00:01:55.649> fine

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
hair is very very very like baby fine

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.950 
hair is very very very like baby fine
and<00:01:56.310> soft<00:01:56.570> so<00:01:58.340> if<00:01:59.340> I<00:01:59.490> had<00:01:59.700> like<00:01:59.969> some<00:02:00.210> wave<00:02:00.450> or

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
and soft so if I had like some wave or

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.109 
and soft so if I had like some wave or
like<00:02:01.140> curl<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:02.100> it<00:02:02.310> might<00:02:02.460> be<00:02:02.640> easier<00:02:03.000> to

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
like curl to it it might be easier to

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.940 
like curl to it it might be easier to
like<00:02:03.270> push<00:02:03.509> around<00:02:03.689> and<00:02:04.049> like<00:02:04.200> you<00:02:04.829> know
