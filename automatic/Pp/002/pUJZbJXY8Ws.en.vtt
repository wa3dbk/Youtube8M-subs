00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:07.950
 The day I think that I want to solve the In subsequent of descending powers of the problem 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:14.789
 Yea-old third edition 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:18.330
 3x squared + 9 xi-6y + y squared + 4x-7 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:21.930
 About this is a complex child 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:26.450
 This is a review What time equation with respect to x 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:29.670
 With the No. 2 out you eh songs 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:34.610
 Kutteyuu is a problem case in the order of how should 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:37.880
 The problem is that the constant term which could perform balsan 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:41.810
 Then the first answer is the first 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:45.180
 Because to say that do you when equation related to x 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:47.560
 I did not think about x-number 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.960
 By say 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.790
 Come on two more than a year 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.790
 One by one 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.760
 6 times more than 0 y 0 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.070
 4x is one 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.670
 Minus thing is 0 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:06.970
 That is the largest number of characters in this 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:10.030
 So the answer is quadratic 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:14.450
 Is the correct answer This is about x 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.950
 You can say'm equation of the rainbow 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.530
 Well then 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:23.960
 attached to the x is case in descending order 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.490
 As it is written as a walk about today's festival x 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:31.460
 Here 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:33.800
 We will arrange from the left in the order of the height of 2 for only x 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:38.940
 But it is to say in the order of this is descending powers 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:44.280
 Next, in a letter to write numbers but says that just difficult 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:45.710
 Finally here is the fact that the end to summarize the like terms but I point 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.170
 You will receive 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.170
 Let's actually solve it where we put it from time to time 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.700
 this problem 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.740
 The star is here 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:02.170
 Please give me this formula 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:06.570
 If we arrange in order from the left while the number of letters is high for x 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:09.289
 3x or more This is good number of letters 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.390
 xy is 1 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:17.750
 4x is 1 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:18.319
 6 y 0 times or more of the taste of the whole thing is that the number of letters in this order of destruction 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.020
 I'd also say 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:23.080
 I was accustomed to the world 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:27.700
 Next was 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:33.850
 What are you going to do with 3x shock now is the character here 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:35.970
 Since this is supposed to be numeric characters numbers , order the characters that can be written firmly 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.970
 The 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.920
 I'm waiting 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.180
 Hmm 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:47.239
 Wai was considered as a numerical value so well we are thinking only about the x 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.239
 car 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.730
 th 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.730
 The numbers are already in order of time 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:06.280
 403 It was 5 o'clock originally, but I would like you to pay some attention 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:10.960
 This is also slightly prepared for attack about the first place in the sober 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:14.440
 After all it is a beautiful hidden and natural form so I think it would be better 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:16.030
 This is so we also firmly holding such a place so or have worked later 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.769
 Let's go 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:25.030
 Is to put the same kind of term as what to do last 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:28.530
 It is the same x- coefficient to say 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.530
 I will put together here 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:37.840
 qi + 4x in the form of brackets qi plus ions 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.840
 This same 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.050
 10:00 apply also Tsu accident 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:50.850
 It will be good to go to the Youtuber This is the end of the answer 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:04:00.770
 The was to head criterion of whether the target is somehow x 2 square + I wonder if x + Na and 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.770
 In this 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:11.540
 Goal achieved 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.349
 It is said that such preparation should be re-arranged in order of attack 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:21.579
 No, but the third details the constant term is what attached to something 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:21.579
 Here is the was part does not matter, such as in x because the constant term 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.410
 Yes more than -6 y- 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:41.500
 This is more than a total of four strings high Attack Jun is very important, so firmly 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.500
 Let's hold it down
