00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
have a safety lock on it more and more

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.170

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.429 
lock itself so it can't open or close
accidentally<00:01:23.939> suppose<00:01:24.869> that's<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.140> good<00:01:25.290> idea

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
accidentally suppose that's a good idea

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.179 
accidentally suppose that's a good idea
actually<00:01:25.860> it<00:01:26.189> does<00:01:26.340> improve<00:01:26.610> safety<00:01:27.619> and<00:01:28.619> then

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
actually it does improve safety and then

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.460 
actually it does improve safety and then
