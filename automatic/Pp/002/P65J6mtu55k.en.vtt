00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
anyway here's a review so the be 44.1

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.019 
anyway here's a review so the be 44.1
I'd<00:00:28.560> say<00:00:28.769> excellent<00:00:29.160> kit<00:00:29.460> well<00:00:29.789> thought<00:00:30.000> out

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
I'd say excellent kit well thought out

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.530 
I'd say excellent kit well thought out
very<00:00:30.510> well<00:00:30.689> engineered<00:00:31.140> sturdy<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:32.540> it's

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
very well engineered sturdy and it's

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.229 
very well engineered sturdy and it's
been<00:00:34.170> good<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.469> me<00:00:34.500> so<00:00:34.770> far<00:00:34.980> I've<00:00:35.309> had<00:00:35.460> three

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
been good to me so far I've had three

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.400 
been good to me so far I've had three
problems<00:00:36.540> that<00:00:37.050> could<00:00:37.140> have<00:00:37.260> been<00:00:37.320> avoided

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
problems that could have been avoided

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.770 
problems that could have been avoided
probably<00:00:38.190> but<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:39.090> three<00:00:39.270> problems<00:00:39.510> where

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
probably but the three problems where

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.010 
probably but the three problems where
the<00:00:39.899> first<00:00:40.110> one<00:00:40.320> was<00:00:41.329> the<00:00:42.329> speed<00:00:42.600> controller

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
the first one was the speed controller

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.299 
the first one was the speed controller
as<00:00:43.879> you<00:00:44.879> see<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.059> run<00:00:45.390> Dean's<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:46.309> slaughter

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
as you see I run Dean's and slaughter

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.889 
as you see I run Dean's and slaughter
this<00:00:47.520> on<00:00:47.670> but<00:00:47.910> before<00:00:48.180> I<00:00:48.210> did<00:00:48.480> I<00:00:48.510> clip<00:00:48.780> the

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
this on but before I did I clip the

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.840 
this on but before I did I clip the
wires<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.469> make<00:00:49.590> much<00:00:49.800> less<00:00:50.129> traffic<00:00:50.579> inside

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
wires to make much less traffic inside

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.150 
wires to make much less traffic inside
the<00:00:50.969> body<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.449> then<00:00:52.199> apparently<00:00:52.440> if<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:52.860> clip

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
the body and then apparently if you clip

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.310 
the body and then apparently if you clip
these<00:00:53.309> wires<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:54.030> won't<00:00:54.210> run<00:00:54.390> correctly<00:00:54.420> or<00:00:55.140> at

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
these wires it won't run correctly or at

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.930 
these wires it won't run correctly or at
all<00:00:55.469> which<00:00:55.890> is<00:00:56.010> what<00:00:56.129> i<00:00:56.160> write<00:00:56.340> online<00:00:56.489> later

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
all which is what i write online later

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.209 
all which is what i write online later
so<00:00:57.870> i<00:00:57.899> sent<00:00:58.320> that<00:00:58.410> in<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.590> castle<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.129> they

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
so i sent that in a castle and they

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.889 
so i sent that in a castle and they
replaced<00:00:59.489> it<00:00:59.609> free<00:00:59.789> of<00:00:59.820> charge<00:00:59.910> so<00:01:00.210> kudos<00:01:00.870> to

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
replaced it free of charge so kudos to

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.250 
replaced it free of charge so kudos to
that<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.440> then<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.730> second<00:01:03.090> part<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.570> mean<00:01:04.110> the

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
that and then the second part I mean the

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.500 
that and then the second part I mean the
second<00:01:04.559> error<00:01:05.479> was<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:06.930> I<00:01:07.700> didn't<00:01:08.700> lock<00:01:09.210> tied

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
second error was that I didn't lock tied

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.289 
second error was that I didn't lock tied
the<00:01:09.750> set<00:01:10.560> screw<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:10.979> pinion<00:01:11.250> gear<00:01:11.460> so<00:01:12.119> it

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
the set screw and the pinion gear so it

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.030 
the set screw and the pinion gear so it
came<00:01:12.450> loose<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:13.020> Isaac<00:01:13.500> see<00:01:13.650> it<00:01:13.740> on<00:01:13.860> the

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
came loose and Isaac see it on the

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.530 
came loose and Isaac see it on the
slipper<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.520> spur<00:01:14.760> gear<00:01:14.790> here<00:01:15.180> it's<00:01:15.330> over

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
slipper and the spur gear here it's over

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.980 
slipper and the spur gear here it's over
here<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.220> we're<00:01:17.220> all<00:01:18.180> right<00:01:18.330> there<00:01:18.570> we<00:01:18.659> go<00:01:18.750> and

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
here and we're all right there we go and

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.270 
here and we're all right there we go and
this<00:01:19.220> where<00:01:20.220> am<00:01:20.310> I<00:01:20.540> it<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.950> stripped<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.040> spur

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
this where am I it a stripped the spur

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.070 
this where am I it a stripped the spur
gear<00:01:23.360> so<00:01:24.360> that's<00:01:24.540> why<00:01:24.659> this<00:01:24.720> thing<00:01:24.930> isn't

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
gear so that's why this thing isn't

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.210 
gear so that's why this thing isn't
running<00:01:25.290> right<00:01:25.500> now<00:01:25.530> got<00:01:25.979> one<00:01:26.100> of<00:01:26.159> these

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
running right now got one of these

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.660 
running right now got one of these
coming<00:01:26.549> in<00:01:26.670> from<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:26.970> main<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.530> then<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:29.310> third

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
coming in from a main and then the third

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.340 
coming in from a main and then the third
problem<00:01:30.150> which<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:30.990> probably<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.290> most

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
problem which is probably the most

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.950 
problem which is probably the most
annoying<00:01:31.619> one<00:01:31.950> this<00:01:32.490> one<00:01:32.700> is<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.420> steering

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
annoying one this one is a steering

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.300 
annoying one this one is a steering
would<00:01:34.680> lock<00:01:34.950> up<00:01:35.189> if<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:36.030> turn<00:01:36.210> too<00:01:36.450> sharp<00:01:36.720> so

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
would lock up if you turn too sharp so

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.800 
would lock up if you turn too sharp so
that<00:01:38.310> was<00:01:38.400> something<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:38.720> surfaced<00:01:39.720> the

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
that was something that surfaced the

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.840 
that was something that surfaced the
very<00:01:39.990> beginning<00:01:40.320> but<00:01:40.470> now<00:01:40.530> after<00:01:41.130> kind<00:01:41.759> of

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
very beginning but now after kind of

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.639 
very beginning but now after kind of
tuning<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.479> changing<00:01:42.869> set<00:01:43.079> up<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.409> doesn't

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
tuning and changing set up and doesn't

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.370 
tuning and changing set up and doesn't
really<00:01:43.890> happen<00:01:44.070> too<00:01:44.399> often<00:01:45.020> kind<00:01:46.020> of<00:01:46.079> just<00:01:46.229> a

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
really happen too often kind of just a

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.670 
really happen too often kind of just a

but<00:01:49.680> in<00:01:49.979> saying<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.430> I<00:01:50.670> would<00:01:50.729> give<00:01:50.939> this<00:01:50.970> kit

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
but in saying that I would give this kit

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.530 
but in saying that I would give this kit
solid<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:52.100> because<00:01:53.100> that's<00:01:53.970> not<00:01:54.149> only<00:01:54.329> that<00:01:54.420> big

of a deal can be fixed and none of the

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.370 
of a deal can be fixed and none of the
problems<00:01:57.360> after<00:01:57.630> I've<00:01:57.750> had<00:01:57.869> this<00:01:57.990> Cape<00:01:58.200> for

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
problems after I've had this Cape for

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.980 
problems after I've had this Cape for
about<00:01:58.530> two<00:01:58.860> months<00:01:59.040> now<00:01:59.219> when<00:02:00.210> ran<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.689> whole

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
about two months now when ran a whole

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.690 
about two months now when ran a whole
bunch<00:02:01.170> of<00:02:01.290> batteries<00:02:01.590> through<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.009> so<00:02:02.670> far

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
bunch of batteries through it and so far

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.359 
bunch of batteries through it and so far
nothing<00:02:03.210> serious<00:02:03.600> it's<00:02:03.719> not<00:02:03.899> that<00:02:04.049> bad<00:02:04.369> it's

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369

carbon<00:02:08.369> fiber<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:09.110> blue<00:02:10.110> anodized

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
carbon fiber and blue anodized

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.730 
carbon fiber and blue anodized
pretty<00:02:11.970> much<00:02:12.060> everywhere<00:02:12.450> and<00:02:13.080> titanium<00:02:13.590> turn

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
pretty much everywhere and titanium turn

that's<00:02:15.150> nice<00:02:16.160> shocks<00:02:17.160> good<00:02:17.580> and<00:02:18.450> I<00:02:18.510> gave<00:02:18.660> it<00:02:18.750> a

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
that's nice shocks good and I gave it a

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.470 
that's nice shocks good and I gave it a
because<00:02:19.230> it's<00:02:19.500> just<00:02:19.590> so<00:02:20.090> handling<00:02:21.090> it's<00:02:21.240> just

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
because it's just so handling it's just

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.630 
because it's just so handling it's just
so<00:02:21.600> smooth<00:02:21.960> and<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.230> turns<00:02:22.470> flies<00:02:23.310> like<00:02:23.520> an

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
so smooth and the turns flies like an

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.120 
so smooth and the turns flies like an
eagle<00:02:23.940> and<00:02:24.030> it<00:02:24.180> just<00:02:24.360> crashes<00:02:24.570> like<00:02:24.810> a<00:02:24.840> rock<00:02:25.130> so

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
eagle and it just crashes like a rock so

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.460 
eagle and it just crashes like a rock so
I<00:02:26.160> mean<00:02:26.460> saying<00:02:26.850> that<00:02:27.030> it's<00:02:27.240> pretty<00:02:27.420> good<00:02:27.660> I've

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
I mean saying that it's pretty good I've

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.410 
I mean saying that it's pretty good I've
been<00:02:28.620> impressed<00:02:29.010> with<00:02:29.430> associated<00:02:30.210> and<00:02:30.330> their

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
been impressed with associated and their

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.990 
been impressed with associated and their
designs<00:02:30.750> so<00:02:32.360> other<00:02:33.360> than<00:02:33.630> that<00:02:33.690> I<00:02:34.700> really<00:02:35.700> know

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
designs so other than that I really know

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000 
designs so other than that I really know
what<00:02:36.120> else<00:02:36.150> to<00:02:36.330> say<00:02:36.570> I'm<00:02:37.470> thinking<00:02:37.680> about

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
what else to say I'm thinking about

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.980 
what else to say I'm thinking about
putting<00:02:38.220> up<00:02:38.340> more<00:02:38.490> videos<00:02:38.850> in<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.180> future<00:02:39.210> you

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
putting up more videos in the future you

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.570 
putting up more videos in the future you
know<00:02:40.110> I<00:02:40.140> probably<00:02:40.320> got<00:02:40.500> that<00:02:40.710> blade<00:02:40.950> msr<00:02:41.190> right

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
know I probably got that blade msr right

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.150 
know I probably got that blade msr right
there<00:02:41.820> do<00:02:42.600> some<00:02:42.810> of<00:02:42.900> that<00:02:42.930> but<00:02:43.710> other<00:02:43.950> than

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
there do some of that but other than

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.190 
there do some of that but other than
that<00:02:44.250> I<00:02:44.340> guess<00:02:44.460> it's<00:02:44.730> just<00:02:44.790> later<00:02:45.360> guys<00:02:45.540> quick

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200
