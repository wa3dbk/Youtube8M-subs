00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
banding that can become very very slip

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:52.200 
banding that can become very very slip
it<00:00:50.170> when<00:00:50.319> it's<00:00:50.499> wet<00:00:50.739> also<00:00:51.549> this<00:00:51.670> road<00:00:51.909> has<00:00:52.059> got

it when it's wet also this road has got
some<00:00:52.359> little<00:00:52.479> ruts<00:00:52.809> in<00:00:52.989> it<00:00:53.079> here<00:00:53.260> and<00:00:53.409> there

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:53.589 
some little ruts in it here and there

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:56.009 
some little ruts in it here and there
now<00:00:54.309> they<00:00:54.459> will<00:00:54.639> hold<00:00:54.819> water<00:00:55.089> so<00:00:55.539> if<00:00:55.629> this<00:00:55.749> road

00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:56.019 
now they will hold water so if this road

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:58.709 
now they will hold water so if this road
has<00:00:56.170> been<00:00:56.440> frozen<00:00:57.030> it<00:00:58.030> may<00:00:58.179> have<00:00:58.299> all<00:00:58.449> thawed

00:00:58.709 --> 00:00:58.719 
has been frozen it may have all thawed

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:00.779 
has been frozen it may have all thawed
out<00:00:58.870> it<00:00:59.049> may<00:00:59.199> be<00:00:59.260> nice<00:00:59.499> and<00:00:59.739> fine<00:00:59.949> now<00:01:00.190> but

00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:00.789 
out it may be nice and fine now but

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:02.729 
out it may be nice and fine now but
where<00:01:00.940> those<00:01:01.089> ruts<00:01:01.329> are<00:01:01.539> the<00:01:02.079> water<00:01:02.260> could<00:01:02.619> be

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
where those ruts are the water could be

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:04.770 
where those ruts are the water could be
an<00:01:02.829> inch<00:01:02.949> or<00:01:03.069> so<00:01:03.100> deep<00:01:03.459> that<00:01:03.909> will<00:01:04.089> be<00:01:04.210> ice<00:01:04.330> that

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
an inch or so deep that will be ice that

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.480 
an inch or so deep that will be ice that
will<00:01:05.019> not<00:01:05.260> fall<00:01:05.560> out<00:01:05.590> that<00:01:05.950> will<00:01:06.070> be<00:01:06.160> there<00:01:06.340> for

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
will not fall out that will be there for

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.340 
will not fall out that will be there for
a<00:01:06.820> long<00:01:07.030> time<00:01:07.300> so<00:01:07.510> you<00:01:07.570> need<00:01:07.720> to<00:01:07.870> be<00:01:08.020> aware<00:01:08.290> of

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
a long time so you need to be aware of

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.470 
a long time so you need to be aware of
that<00:01:08.650> white<00:01:09.250> lines<00:01:09.550> and<00:01:09.820> markings<00:01:10.240> and<00:01:10.360> when

you<00:01:10.570> see<00:01:10.750> you<00:01:10.990> know<00:01:11.020> big<00:01:11.290> white<00:01:11.470> lines<00:01:11.710> but<00:01:11.860> it

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
you see you know big white lines but it

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.980 
you see you know big white lines but it
says<00:01:12.130> slow<00:01:12.520> across<00:01:12.850> the<00:01:12.940> road<00:01:13.120> in<00:01:13.570> that<00:01:13.750> white

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
says slow across the road in that white

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.600 
says slow across the road in that white

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
paint well that is slippery

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.580 
paint well that is slippery

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
overtaking some of the vehicles you're

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.430 
overtaking some of the vehicles you're
gonna<00:01:39.520> have<00:01:39.610> to<00:01:39.730> cross<00:01:39.940> that<00:01:40.180> so<00:01:40.840> be<00:01:41.140> aware<00:01:41.230> of

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 
gonna have to cross that so be aware of

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.810 
gonna have to cross that so be aware of
that<00:01:41.620> you<00:01:41.770> might<00:01:41.980> pull<00:01:42.220> out<00:01:42.340> it<00:01:42.520> might<00:01:42.640> be

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
that you might pull out it might be

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.220 
that you might pull out it might be
clear<00:01:43.030> and<00:01:43.150> then<00:01:43.270> you<00:01:43.360> might<00:01:43.510> run<00:01:43.690> into<00:01:43.810> a<00:01:43.960> load

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:44.230 
clear and then you might run into a load

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:45.930 
clear and then you might run into a load
of<00:01:44.380> damp<00:01:44.590> leaves<00:01:44.800> down<00:01:45.400> the<00:01:45.580> middle<00:01:45.790> of<00:01:45.850> the

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
of damp leaves down the middle of the

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.540 
of damp leaves down the middle of the
road<00:01:46.120> it's<00:01:46.360> not<00:01:46.570> good<00:01:46.780> at<00:01:46.900> all<00:01:47.140> if<00:01:47.680> you<00:01:48.340> should

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
road it's not good at all if you should

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:49.950 
road it's not good at all if you should
be<00:01:48.700> out<00:01:48.820> in<00:01:48.970> the<00:01:49.060> middle<00:01:49.180> of<00:01:49.330> nowhere<00:01:49.720> and<00:01:49.900> you

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
be out in the middle of nowhere and you

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.020 
be out in the middle of nowhere and you
get<00:01:50.320> flooded<00:01:50.950> so<00:01:51.190> let's<00:01:51.310> say<00:01:51.460> the<00:01:51.580> road<00:01:51.760> gets

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
get flooded so let's say the road gets

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.370 
get flooded so let's say the road gets
flooded<00:01:52.270> it's<00:01:52.540> full<00:01:52.780> of<00:01:52.870> water<00:01:53.050> you'll<00:01:53.350> be

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
flooded it's full of water you'll be

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.450 
flooded it's full of water you'll be
tough<00:01:53.590> to<00:01:53.710> be<00:01:53.800> out<00:01:53.890> on<00:01:53.920> a<00:01:54.040> bike<00:01:54.220> in<00:01:54.370> that

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
tough to be out on a bike in that

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.920 
tough to be out on a bike in that
weather<00:01:54.640> I<00:01:54.760> can<00:01:54.790> tell<00:01:55.060> you<00:01:55.150> but<00:01:55.270> it<00:01:55.480> could<00:01:55.750> get

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
weather I can tell you but it could get

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.360 
weather I can tell you but it could get
flooded<00:01:56.320> if<00:01:56.440> you're<00:01:56.560> in<00:01:56.680> the<00:01:56.740> middle<00:01:56.950> of<00:01:57.040> Wales

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:57.370 
flooded if you're in the middle of Wales

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.250 
flooded if you're in the middle of Wales
or<00:01:57.640> somewhere<00:01:57.909> let's<00:01:58.090> say<00:01:58.270> so<00:01:58.990> you're<00:01:59.110> going

00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.260 
or somewhere let's say so you're going

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.719 
or somewhere let's say so you're going
down<00:01:59.409> the<00:01:59.500> road<00:01:59.650> water

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
down the road water

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.610 
down the road water
where's<00:02:01.300> the<00:02:01.479> best<00:02:01.659> place<00:02:01.870> to<00:02:01.900> ride<00:02:02.170> your<00:02:02.350> bike

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:02.620 
where's the best place to ride your bike

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.950 
where's the best place to ride your bike
obviously<00:02:03.159> in<00:02:03.640> the<00:02:03.850> shallowest<00:02:04.240> part<00:02:04.600> of<00:02:04.810> that

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
obviously in the shallowest part of that

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.149 
obviously in the shallowest part of that
water<00:02:05.170> you<00:02:05.409> don't<00:02:05.560> have<00:02:05.740> gone<00:02:05.830> through<00:02:05.979> deep

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
water you don't have gone through deep

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.009 
water you don't have gone through deep
water<00:02:06.190> where<00:02:06.820> is<00:02:07.030> the<00:02:07.180> shallowest<00:02:07.479> part<00:02:07.750> well

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.019 
water where is the shallowest part well

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:10.319 
water where is the shallowest part well
generally<00:02:08.649> speaking<00:02:08.920> on<00:02:09.220> the<00:02:09.759> crown<00:02:10.030> of<00:02:10.060> the

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:10.329 
generally speaking on the crown of the

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:12.390 
generally speaking on the crown of the
road<00:02:10.509> because<00:02:11.290> if<00:02:11.769> they're<00:02:11.950> all<00:02:12.040> shared<00:02:12.310> by

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
road because if they're all shared by

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.920 
road because if they're all shared by
that<00:02:12.549> is<00:02:12.670> shallowest<00:02:13.060> in<00:02:13.209> the<00:02:13.269> middle<00:02:13.480> so<00:02:13.840> you

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
that is shallowest in the middle so you

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.309 
that is shallowest in the middle so you
want<00:02:14.079> to<00:02:14.139> be<00:02:14.200> riding<00:02:14.530> down<00:02:14.560> the<00:02:14.769> middle<00:02:15.129> of

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
want to be riding down the middle of

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.110 
want to be riding down the middle of
obviously<00:02:16.099> make<00:02:16.340> sure<00:02:16.370> there's<00:02:16.670> no<00:02:16.760> oncoming

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
obviously make sure there's no oncoming

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.580 
obviously make sure there's no oncoming
traffic<00:02:17.390> and<00:02:17.659> make<00:02:17.780> sure<00:02:17.930> it's<00:02:18.140> clear<00:02:18.319> to<00:02:18.469> do

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
traffic and make sure it's clear to do

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.500 
traffic and make sure it's clear to do
so<00:02:18.769> chances<00:02:19.159> are<00:02:19.280> long<00:02:19.519> to<00:02:19.640> be<00:02:19.700> you<00:02:20.209> out<00:02:20.329> there

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
so chances are long to be you out there

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:21.910 
so chances are long to be you out there
anyway<00:02:20.810> but<00:02:21.230> right<00:02:21.379> down<00:02:21.560> the<00:02:21.650> middle<00:02:21.680> the

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
anyway but right down the middle the

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.410 
anyway but right down the middle the
road<00:02:22.069> because<00:02:22.280> that<00:02:22.519> is<00:02:22.700> the<00:02:22.849> shallowest<00:02:23.120> bit

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
road because that is the shallowest bit

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.970 
road because that is the shallowest bit
well<00:02:23.989> the<00:02:24.079> thing<00:02:24.260> is<00:02:24.290> the<00:02:24.530> Golden<00:02:24.769> Rule<00:02:24.829> we

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
well the thing is the Golden Rule we

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.979 
well the thing is the Golden Rule we
winter<00:02:25.250> riding<00:02:25.400> is<00:02:25.670> roads<00:02:25.939> that<00:02:26.090> you<00:02:26.150> know<00:02:26.569> to

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
winter riding is roads that you know to

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:28.959 
winter riding is roads that you know to
be<00:02:27.109> good<00:02:27.319> you<00:02:27.560> need<00:02:27.980> to<00:02:28.129> take<00:02:28.310> extra<00:02:28.730> care<00:02:28.909> on

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:28.969 
be good you need to take extra care on

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:31.660 
be good you need to take extra care on
be<00:02:29.299> extra<00:02:29.659> cautious<00:02:29.840> because<00:02:30.319> good<00:02:31.159> roads<00:02:31.430> in

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
be extra cautious because good roads in

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.849 
be extra cautious because good roads in
the<00:02:31.970> winter<00:02:32.060> can<00:02:32.659> become<00:02:32.959> potentially

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:33.859 
the winter can become potentially

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:36.189 
the winter can become potentially
treacherous
