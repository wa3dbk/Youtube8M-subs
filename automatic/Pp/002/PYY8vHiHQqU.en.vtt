liking these both colors look really
nice<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:22.230> I<00:02:22.650> would<00:02:22.799> say<00:02:22.950> that<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.250> maroon

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
nice the I would say that the maroon

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.280 
nice the I would say that the maroon
ones<00:02:23.700> probably<00:02:24.090> work<00:02:24.480> better<00:02:24.690> with<00:02:24.900> his<00:02:25.049> brown

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
ones probably work better with his brown

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.009 
ones probably work better with his brown
color<00:02:25.620> but<00:02:26.209> these<00:02:27.209> ones<00:02:27.390> are<00:02:27.569> probably<00:02:27.810> more

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
color but these ones are probably more

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:30.350 
color but these ones are probably more
versatile<00:02:28.709> being<00:02:29.010> that<00:02:29.129> they're<00:02:29.280> blue<00:02:29.519> and

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
versatile being that they're blue and

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:39.410 
versatile being that they're blue and
blue<00:02:30.660> goes<00:02:30.840> with<00:02:31.019> anything<00:02:38.150> brown<00:02:39.150> underneath

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
blue goes with anything brown underneath

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:46.729 
blue goes with anything brown underneath
the<00:02:39.660> tongue<00:02:39.900> pretty<00:02:40.860> standard<00:02:45.560> well<00:02:46.560> hope<00:02:46.709> you
