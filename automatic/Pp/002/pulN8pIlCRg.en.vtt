to learn how to remove the typical blue
haze<00:00:11.610> from<00:00:12.000> scenic<00:00:12.420> photos<00:00:12.809> which<00:00:13.110> is<00:00:13.349> an

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
haze from scenic photos which is an

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.060 
haze from scenic photos which is an
atmospheric<00:00:14.130> distortion<00:00:15.030> that<00:00:15.150> happens<00:00:15.540> as

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.070 
atmospheric distortion that happens as

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.279 
atmospheric distortion that happens as
distances<00:00:17.070> pass<00:00:17.310> and<00:00:17.869> there<00:00:18.869> are<00:00:18.960> some<00:00:19.109> clouds

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
distances pass and there are some clouds

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.500 
distances pass and there are some clouds
and<00:00:19.590> haze<00:00:19.770> coming<00:00:20.160> through<00:00:20.369> typically<00:00:21.359> an

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
and haze coming through typically an

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.540 
and haze coming through typically an
image<00:00:21.779> as<00:00:22.050> it<00:00:22.350> goes<00:00:22.500> further<00:00:22.830> and<00:00:22.949> further<00:00:23.220> out

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
image as it goes further and further out

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.820 
image as it goes further and further out
and<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.789> distance<00:00:24.210> will<00:00:24.420> shift<00:00:24.720> to<00:00:25.050> more<00:00:25.619> of<00:00:25.740> a

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
and the distance will shift to more of a

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.759 
and the distance will shift to more of a
blue<00:00:26.039> cast<00:00:26.340> so<00:00:26.609> we're<00:00:26.730> gonna<00:00:26.820> learn<00:00:27.000> how<00:00:27.269> to

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:27.769 
blue cast so we're gonna learn how to

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:29.960 
blue cast so we're gonna learn how to
you<00:00:28.769> know<00:00:28.800> color<00:00:29.130> correct<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.609> photo<00:00:29.820> to

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
you know color correct the photo to

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.380 
you know color correct the photo to
remove<00:00:30.420> that<00:00:30.599> blue<00:00:30.810> haze<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.349> make<00:00:31.920> it<00:00:32.130> as<00:00:32.790> it

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
remove that blue haze and make it as it

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.209 
remove that blue haze and make it as it
should<00:00:33.600> have<00:00:33.750> been<00:00:33.930> so<00:00:34.620> let's<00:00:34.920> have<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.100> look

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
should have been so let's have a look

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.459 
should have been so let's have a look
here<00:00:35.430> so<00:00:35.579> here<00:00:35.820> we<00:00:35.940> have<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.870> image<00:00:36.989> here<00:00:37.350> it's

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
here so here we have the image here it's

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.250 
here so here we have the image here it's
quite<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.710> nice<00:00:38.129> scenic<00:00:38.730> photo<00:00:39.059> here<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.510> as

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
quite a nice scenic photo here and as

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
you can see here from the distance as we

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.760 
you can see here from the distance as we
get<00:00:42.450> further<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:42.930> further<00:00:42.989> we<00:00:43.379> start<00:00:43.649> getting

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
get further and further we start getting

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.520 
get further and further we start getting
a<00:00:44.040> bit<00:00:44.100> of<00:00:44.700> that<00:00:44.850> blue<00:00:45.239> haze<00:00:45.660> coming<00:00:46.260> through

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
a bit of that blue haze coming through

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.650 
a bit of that blue haze coming through
here<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.010> also<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.180> image<00:00:48.450> here<00:00:48.629> and

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
here and also the the image here and

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.420 
here and also the the image here and
nothing<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:49.079> it's<00:00:49.289> it's<00:00:49.469> pretty<00:00:49.620> flat<00:00:49.980> here

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
nothing is it's it's pretty flat here

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.439 
nothing is it's it's pretty flat here
the<00:00:51.710> the<00:00:52.710> colors<00:00:53.460> here<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.300> the

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
the the colors here of the a of the

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:55.970 
the the colors here of the a of the
image<00:00:54.629> so<00:00:54.780> we're<00:00:54.899> just<00:00:54.930> gonna<00:00:55.079> just<00:00:55.590> do<00:00:55.710> an

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
image so we're just gonna just do an

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.680 
image so we're just gonna just do an
overall<00:00:56.340> color<00:00:56.670> just<00:00:57.059> in<00:00:57.180> here<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.480> remove

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
overall color just in here and remove

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.260 
overall color just in here and remove
that<00:00:57.870> blue<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.260> so<00:00:58.379> forth<00:00:58.680> so<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.699> first<00:00:59.910> step

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
that blue and so forth so the first step

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.270 
that blue and so forth so the first step
here<00:01:00.539> is<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:01.020> create<00:01:01.469> an<00:01:01.739> adjustment<00:01:02.010> layer

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
here is to create an adjustment layer

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.920 
here is to create an adjustment layer
we're<00:01:02.640> going<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.850> go<00:01:03.059> ahead<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.480> click<00:01:03.809> on

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
we're going to go ahead and click on

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.710 
we're going to go ahead and click on
levels<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.909> now<00:01:05.909> we're<00:01:06.060> going<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.210> go<00:01:06.330> into

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
levels and now we're going to go into

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.969 
levels and now we're going to go into
each<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:07.080> our<00:01:07.170> channels<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.909> correct<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.979> the

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
each of our channels and correct the the

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.280 
each of our channels and correct the the
level<00:01:11.460> output<00:01:11.909> of<00:01:12.060> each<00:01:12.210> of<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.659> channels<00:01:12.930> so

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
level output of each of the channels so

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.830 
level output of each of the channels so
if<00:01:13.530> we<00:01:13.619> go<00:01:13.770> in<00:01:13.890> here<00:01:14.010> into<00:01:14.189> red<00:01:14.549> as<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:15.540> can<00:01:15.659> see

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
if we go in here into red as you can see

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.899 
if we go in here into red as you can see
here<00:01:16.140> there's<00:01:16.350> no<00:01:16.619> information<00:01:16.950> here<00:01:17.460> all<00:01:17.700> the

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
here there's no information here all the

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.749 
here there's no information here all the
way<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.720> this<00:01:18.930> point<00:01:19.049> here<00:01:19.799> so<00:01:19.950> what<00:01:20.460> we<00:01:20.610> need

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
way to this point here so what we need

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.390 
way to this point here so what we need
to<00:01:20.880> do<00:01:21.000> is<00:01:21.150> just<00:01:21.299> move<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.720> slider<00:01:22.020> so<00:01:22.320> that<00:01:23.280> we

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
to do is just move the slider so that we

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.249 
to do is just move the slider so that we
get<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.820> point<00:01:24.090> where<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.750> actual

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
get to the point where the actual

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.469 
get to the point where the actual
information<00:01:25.560> in<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.280> image<00:01:26.400> begins<00:01:26.939> for<00:01:27.390> the

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
information in the image begins for the

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.120 
information in the image begins for the
red<00:01:27.630> Channel<00:01:28.049> we're<00:01:28.619> going<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.799> move<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:29.009> to

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
red Channel we're going to move it to

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.240 
red Channel we're going to move it to
the<00:01:29.220> green<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:30.799> then<00:01:31.799> we're<00:01:31.950> going<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.100> move

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
the green and then we're going to move

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.120 
the green and then we're going to move
it<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.640> blue<00:01:32.909> so<00:01:33.869> that<00:01:34.140> we<00:01:34.320> have<00:01:34.560> and

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
it to the blue so that we have and

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.980 
it to the blue so that we have and
already<00:01:35.640> we<00:01:36.030> start<00:01:36.299> corrupt<00:01:36.720> color

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
already we start corrupt color

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.410 
already we start corrupt color
correcting<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.710> photo<00:01:37.950> so<00:01:38.189> let's<00:01:38.430> move<00:01:39.210> this

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
correcting the photo so let's move this

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.060 
correcting the photo so let's move this
here<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:40.110> I'll<00:01:40.350> show<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.680> before<00:01:41.040> and

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
here and I'll show you the before and

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.460 
here and I'll show you the before and
the<00:01:41.939> after<00:01:41.970> so<00:01:42.420> we're<00:01:42.570> adding<00:01:42.750> some<00:01:42.960> contrast

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
the after so we're adding some contrast

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.870 
the after so we're adding some contrast
and<00:01:43.560> we're<00:01:43.710> actually<00:01:43.799> color<00:01:44.189> correcting<00:01:44.700> a

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
and we're actually color correcting a

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.539 
and we're actually color correcting a
bit<00:01:45.329> of<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.570> photo<00:01:45.869> now<00:01:46.649> you<00:01:46.710> might<00:01:47.100> ask<00:01:47.130> why

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
bit of the photo now you might ask why

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.969 
bit of the photo now you might ask why
did<00:01:47.759> we<00:01:47.909> do<00:01:48.119> for<00:01:48.420> each<00:01:49.110> one<00:01:49.320> of<00:01:49.380> these<00:01:49.500> channels

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
did we do for each one of these channels

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.030 
did we do for each one of these channels
instead<00:01:50.520> of<00:01:50.610> just<00:01:50.909> moving<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.470> RGB<00:01:52.470> one<00:01:52.799> here

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
instead of just moving the RGB one here

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.219 
instead of just moving the RGB one here
because<00:01:53.399> it<00:01:53.520> looked<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.909> bit<00:01:54.149> similar<00:01:54.420> well<00:01:55.110> the

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
because it looked a bit similar well the

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.959 
because it looked a bit similar well the
reason<00:01:55.470> for<00:01:55.590> that<00:01:55.649> is<00:01:55.860> that<00:01:56.009> each<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.670> RGB

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
reason for that is that each the RGB

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.560 
reason for that is that each the RGB
would<00:01:57.210> just<00:01:57.360> move<00:01:57.899> an<00:01:58.829> average<00:01:59.460> of<00:01:59.640> all<00:02:00.329> of<00:02:00.479> the

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
would just move an average of all of the

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.270 
would just move an average of all of the
channels<00:02:00.750> together<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.530> if<00:02:01.680> we<00:02:01.799> do<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.100> red

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
channels together and if we do the red

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.179 
channels together and if we do the red
we<00:02:02.939> can<00:02:03.119> put<00:02:03.360> move<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.930> red<00:02:04.079> exactly<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:04.979> where

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
we can put move the red exactly to where

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.719 
we can put move the red exactly to where
the<00:02:05.700> red<00:02:05.880> begins<00:02:06.240> so<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.479> red<00:02:06.600> begins<00:02:06.930> at<00:02:07.049> 27

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
the red begins so the red begins at 27

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.300 
the red begins so the red begins at 27
the<00:02:08.729> green<00:02:08.970> moves<00:02:09.209> at<00:02:09.420> 25<00:02:09.899> and<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.500> blue<00:02:10.649> at<00:02:10.800> 15

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
the green moves at 25 and the blue at 15

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.440 
the green moves at 25 and the blue at 15
so<00:02:11.520> there's<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:11.760> bit<00:02:11.879> of<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.030> difference<00:02:12.390> there

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
so there's a bit of a difference there

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.910 
so there's a bit of a difference there
and<00:02:12.750> if<00:02:13.140> you<00:02:13.260> just<00:02:13.410> do<00:02:13.530> with<00:02:13.709> the

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
and if you just do with the

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.610 
and if you just do with the
do<00:02:14.250> not<00:02:14.430> doing<00:02:14.670> to<00:02:15.600> the<00:02:15.690> most<00:02:15.870> correct<00:02:16.230> thing

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
do not doing to the most correct thing

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.590 
do not doing to the most correct thing
so<00:02:16.860> if<00:02:16.950> you<00:02:17.040> want<00:02:17.160> to<00:02:17.250> have<00:02:17.370> your<00:02:17.550> your<00:02:18.209> image

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
so if you want to have your your image

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.750 
so if you want to have your your image
color<00:02:18.959> corrected<00:02:19.470> it's<00:02:19.860> better<00:02:20.130> to<00:02:20.310> do<00:02:20.459> it<00:02:20.490> in

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
color corrected it's better to do it in

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.000 
color corrected it's better to do it in
each<00:02:21.180> of<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.450> channels<00:02:21.840> now<00:02:22.500> we<00:02:22.560> are<00:02:22.770> going<00:02:22.950> to

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
each of the channels now we are going to

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.710 
each of the channels now we are going to
make<00:02:23.130> one<00:02:23.370> modification<00:02:23.940> to<00:02:24.150> all<00:02:24.450> of<00:02:24.600> the

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
make one modification to all of the

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.840 
make one modification to all of the
channels<00:02:24.900> at<00:02:25.170> once<00:02:25.350> so<00:02:25.770> we<00:02:25.800> need<00:02:26.040> to<00:02:26.190> go<00:02:26.730> back

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
channels at once so we need to go back

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.000 
channels at once so we need to go back
in<00:02:27.060> here<00:02:27.270> into<00:02:27.630> our<00:02:27.660> RGB<00:02:28.140> and<00:02:28.500> that

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
in here into our RGB and that

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.000 
in here into our RGB and that
modification<00:02:29.370> here<00:02:29.880> is<00:02:30.060> changing<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:31.050> gray

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
modification here is changing the gray

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.310 
modification here is changing the gray
setting<00:02:32.820> for<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:33.150> image<00:02:33.390> so<00:02:33.570> the<00:02:33.660> gray<00:02:33.900> point

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
setting for the image so the gray point

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.810 
setting for the image so the gray point
so<00:02:34.500> we're<00:02:34.620> going<00:02:34.709> to<00:02:34.800> click<00:02:35.010> here<00:02:35.040> for<00:02:35.730> the

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
so we're going to click here for the

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.930 
so we're going to click here for the
sample<00:02:36.240> in<00:02:36.450> image<00:02:36.930> to<00:02:37.740> set<00:02:37.950> a<00:02:38.160> gray<00:02:38.400> point<00:02:38.790> so

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
sample in image to set a gray point so

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.090 
sample in image to set a gray point so
we're<00:02:39.030> going<00:02:39.120> to<00:02:39.180> click<00:02:39.390> on<00:02:39.450> that<00:02:39.800> and<00:02:40.800> now

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
we're going to click on that and now

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.030 
we're going to click on that and now
we're<00:02:41.250> going<00:02:41.340> to<00:02:41.430> go<00:02:41.520> ahead<00:02:41.700> and<00:02:42.060> click<00:02:42.570> on<00:02:42.750> an

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
we're going to go ahead and click on an

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.190 
we're going to go ahead and click on an
area<00:02:44.040> of<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.400> image<00:02:44.700> that<00:02:44.970> is<00:02:45.390> supposed<00:02:45.900> to<00:02:46.080> be

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
area of the image that is supposed to be

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.710 
area of the image that is supposed to be
gray<00:02:46.770> now<00:02:47.430> before<00:02:47.730> I<00:02:47.760> do<00:02:47.850> this<00:02:48.060> let<00:02:48.300> me<00:02:48.360> just<00:02:48.420> to

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
gray now before I do this let me just to

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.000 
gray now before I do this let me just to
show<00:02:48.900> you<00:02:48.959> something<00:02:49.350> that<00:02:49.380> is<00:02:49.560> important<00:02:49.950> to

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
show you something that is important to

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.070 
show you something that is important to
have<00:02:50.220> first<00:02:50.640> so<00:02:50.970> let<00:02:51.180> me<00:02:51.209> just<00:02:51.330> backtrack<00:02:51.780> just

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
have first so let me just backtrack just

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.080 
have first so let me just backtrack just
a<00:02:52.110> little<00:02:52.320> bit<00:02:52.410> I'll<00:02:52.560> click<00:02:52.769> OK<00:02:53.070> for<00:02:53.130> now<00:02:53.310> and

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
a little bit I'll click OK for now and

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.150 
a little bit I'll click OK for now and
that<00:02:54.420> is<00:02:54.540> on<00:02:54.780> your<00:02:55.080> eyedropper<00:02:55.290> tool<00:02:55.860> because

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
that is on your eyedropper tool because

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.500 
that is on your eyedropper tool because
we're<00:02:56.370> essentially<00:02:56.850> using<00:02:57.209> the<00:02:57.300> eyedropper

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
we're essentially using the eyedropper

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.720 
we're essentially using the eyedropper
tool<00:02:58.050> to<00:02:58.200> select<00:02:58.380> the<00:02:58.680> gray<00:02:58.860> you<00:02:59.430> want<00:02:59.580> to<00:02:59.640> make

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
tool to select the gray you want to make

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.160 
tool to select the gray you want to make
sure<00:02:59.910> that<00:03:00.030> your<00:03:00.209> eyedropper<00:03:00.360> tool<00:03:00.870> is<00:03:00.989> set

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
sure that your eyedropper tool is set

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.490 
sure that your eyedropper tool is set
here<00:03:01.530> at<00:03:01.709> a<00:03:02.100> 5x5<00:03:02.940> average<00:03:03.570> instead<00:03:03.989> of<00:03:04.110> a<00:03:04.200> point

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.280 
here at a 5x5 average instead of a point
sample<00:03:04.910> 5x5<00:03:05.910> means<00:03:06.239> that<00:03:06.600> it'll<00:03:06.900> just<00:03:07.110> take

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
sample 5x5 means that it'll just take

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.890 
sample 5x5 means that it'll just take
five<00:03:07.680> pixels<00:03:08.130> by<00:03:08.370> five<00:03:08.670> pixels<00:03:09.090> and<00:03:09.390> image

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
five pixels by five pixels and image

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.800 
five pixels by five pixels and image
area<00:03:10.080> and<00:03:10.380> it<00:03:10.920> will<00:03:11.070> average<00:03:11.280> out<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:12.510> color

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
area and it will average out the color

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.690 
area and it will average out the color
between<00:03:13.050> these<00:03:13.500> five<00:03:13.739> things<00:03:14.100> so<00:03:14.489> you're<00:03:14.610> not

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
between these five things so you're not

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.520 
between these five things so you're not
getting<00:03:15.060> an<00:03:15.180> anomaly<00:03:15.690> of<00:03:15.720> just<00:03:16.050> one<00:03:16.260> pixel

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
getting an anomaly of just one pixel

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.830 
getting an anomaly of just one pixel
that<00:03:16.830> is<00:03:17.060> radically<00:03:18.060> different<00:03:18.090> from<00:03:18.450> all<00:03:18.720> the

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
that is radically different from all the

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.170 
that is radically different from all the
others<00:03:19.140> that<00:03:19.380> you<00:03:19.500> couldn't<00:03:19.940> noticeably<00:03:20.940> pick

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
others that you couldn't noticeably pick

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.990 
others that you couldn't noticeably pick
up<00:03:21.360> so<00:03:21.630> let's<00:03:22.170> go<00:03:22.320> back<00:03:22.470> in<00:03:22.620> here<00:03:22.799> and<00:03:22.860> and<00:03:23.790> do

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
up so let's go back in here and and do

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.640 
up so let's go back in here and and do
that<00:03:24.180> now<00:03:24.390> so<00:03:24.630> we're<00:03:24.750> gonna<00:03:24.810> go<00:03:25.049> ahead<00:03:25.110> and

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
that now so we're gonna go ahead and

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.000 
that now so we're gonna go ahead and
click<00:03:26.010> on<00:03:26.190> our<00:03:26.510> gray<00:03:27.510> point<00:03:28.019> here<00:03:28.440> and<00:03:28.860> now

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
click on our gray point here and now

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.620 
click on our gray point here and now
we're<00:03:29.130> going<00:03:29.250> to<00:03:29.340> set<00:03:29.610> the<00:03:29.790> gray<00:03:30.000> point<00:03:30.360> so

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
we're going to set the gray point so

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.590 
we're going to set the gray point so
we're<00:03:30.750> gonna<00:03:30.840> make<00:03:31.049> sure<00:03:31.079> that<00:03:31.549> we<00:03:32.549> click<00:03:33.450> on

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
we're gonna make sure that we click on

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.210 
we're gonna make sure that we click on
an<00:03:33.720> area<00:03:33.900> that<00:03:34.200> looks<00:03:34.380> like<00:03:34.560> it's<00:03:34.769> a<00:03:34.860> fifty

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
an area that looks like it's a fifty

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.569 
an area that looks like it's a fifty
percent<00:03:35.610> gray<00:03:35.760> so<00:03:36.360> it's<00:03:36.510> between<00:03:37.340> white<00:03:38.340> and

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
percent gray so it's between white and

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:41.600 
percent gray so it's between white and
black<00:03:38.780> so<00:03:39.780> a<00:03:40.049> 50%<00:03:40.380> gray<00:03:40.860> seems<00:03:41.190> pretty<00:03:41.430> good

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
black so a 50% gray seems pretty good

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.460 
black so a 50% gray seems pretty good
around<00:03:41.820> here<00:03:42.180> and<00:03:42.360> as<00:03:42.900> you<00:03:42.989> can<00:03:43.110> see<00:03:43.170> that

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
around here and as you can see that

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.009 
around here and as you can see that
makes<00:03:43.890> already<00:03:44.760> a<00:03:44.850> world<00:03:45.150> of<00:03:45.390> a<00:03:45.450> difference<00:03:45.480> by

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
makes already a world of a difference by

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:47.300 
makes already a world of a difference by
clicking<00:03:46.440> on<00:03:46.560> it<00:03:46.709> and<00:03:46.890> we're<00:03:47.220> already

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
clicking on it and we're already

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.640 
clicking on it and we're already
starting<00:03:47.610> to<00:03:47.790> color<00:03:48.150> calibrate<00:03:49.110> to<00:03:49.140> the<00:03:49.350> image

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
starting to color calibrate to the image

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.500 
starting to color calibrate to the image
so<00:03:50.250> that<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.489> greens<00:03:50.880> are<00:03:51.090> actually<00:03:51.360> now

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
so that the greens are actually now

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.630 
so that the greens are actually now
popping<00:03:52.049> out<00:03:52.200> we<00:03:52.829> still<00:03:53.040> have<00:03:53.160> the<00:03:53.250> blue<00:03:53.400> cast

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
popping out we still have the blue cast

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.220 
popping out we still have the blue cast
problem<00:03:54.150> but<00:03:54.390> we're<00:03:54.510> gonna<00:03:54.600> fix<00:03:54.870> that<00:03:55.079> right

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
problem but we're gonna fix that right

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.660 
problem but we're gonna fix that right
now<00:03:55.440> so<00:03:55.470> we're<00:03:55.799> gonna<00:03:55.890> head<00:03:56.100> and<00:03:56.250> click<00:03:56.400> okay

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
now so we're gonna head and click okay

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.660 
now so we're gonna head and click okay
and<00:03:56.880> now<00:03:57.140> we're<00:03:58.140> going<00:03:58.350> to<00:03:58.530> go<00:03:58.709> into<00:03:59.010> our

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
and now we're going to go into our

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.479 
and now we're going to go into our
adjustment<00:04:00.570> layers<00:04:00.750> again<00:04:00.930> go<00:04:01.739> into<00:04:01.890> hue<00:04:02.310> and

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
adjustment layers again go into hue and

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.720 
adjustment layers again go into hue and
saturation<00:04:02.519> and<00:04:03.500> now<00:04:04.500> we<00:04:04.560> want<00:04:04.890> to<00:04:05.100> instead<00:04:05.610> of

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
saturation and now we want to instead of

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.850 
saturation and now we want to instead of
editing<00:04:06.420> anything<00:04:06.660> here<00:04:07.049> in<00:04:07.170> the<00:04:07.260> master<00:04:07.709> one

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
editing anything here in the master one

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.310 
editing anything here in the master one
which<00:04:08.070> would<00:04:08.250> select<00:04:08.850> all<00:04:09.180> the<00:04:09.390> channels<00:04:09.810> we

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
which would select all the channels we

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.259 
which would select all the channels we
want<00:04:10.560> to<00:04:10.650> go<00:04:10.739> into<00:04:10.950> our<00:04:11.070> blues<00:04:11.370> which<00:04:11.970> is<00:04:12.150> the

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
want to go into our blues which is the

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:13.490 
want to go into our blues which is the
case<00:04:12.420> of<00:04:12.630> our<00:04:12.690> problem<00:04:13.079> here<00:04:13.260> with<00:04:13.410> the

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
case of our problem here with the

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.890 
case of our problem here with the
atmosphere<00:04:13.950> and<00:04:14.160> now<00:04:15.090> we<00:04:15.150> just<00:04:15.390> want<00:04:15.660> to<00:04:15.720> set

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
atmosphere and now we just want to set

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.750 
atmosphere and now we just want to set
the<00:04:16.019> saturation<00:04:16.229> back<00:04:16.890> when<00:04:17.310> I'm<00:04:17.430> not<00:04:17.579> get

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
the saturation back when I'm not get

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.740 
the saturation back when I'm not get
back<00:04:17.940> to<00:04:18.810> around<00:04:19.440> 50%<00:04:19.919> 60%<00:04:20.579> there<00:04:21.390> abouts<00:04:21.570> it

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
back to around 50% 60% there abouts it

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.480 
back to around 50% 60% there abouts it
depends<00:04:22.080> how<00:04:22.169> much<00:04:22.289> you<00:04:22.349> want<00:04:22.680> to<00:04:22.800> go<00:04:22.979> you

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
depends how much you want to go you

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.610 
depends how much you want to go you
don't<00:04:23.640> want<00:04:23.760> to<00:04:23.820> go<00:04:23.910> too<00:04:23.970> far<00:04:24.419> out<00:04:24.479> so<00:04:24.930> that<00:04:25.110> the

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
don't want to go too far out so that the

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:26.530 
don't want to go too far out so that the
image<00:04:25.919> loses

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
image loses

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.600 
image loses
a lot<00:04:26.720> of<00:04:26.750> color<00:04:27.110> so<00:04:27.230> you<00:04:28.040> might<00:04:28.190> want<00:04:28.370> to<00:04:28.430> just

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
a lot of color so you might want to just

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.090 
a lot of color so you might want to just
eyeball<00:04:28.820> this<00:04:29.240> one<00:04:29.450> here<00:04:29.660> and<00:04:29.870> you<00:04:30.830> can<00:04:30.980> also

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
eyeball this one here and you can also

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.190 
eyeball this one here and you can also
tick<00:04:31.370> off<00:04:31.490> the<00:04:31.520> preview<00:04:32.030> to<00:04:32.600> see<00:04:32.630> the<00:04:32.780> before

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 
tick off the preview to see the before

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.080 
tick off the preview to see the before
and<00:04:33.440> then<00:04:33.650> the<00:04:33.770> after<00:04:33.800> and<00:04:34.310> then<00:04:34.610> continue

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
and then the after and then continue

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.390 
and then the after and then continue
making<00:04:35.270> an<00:04:35.420> adjustments<00:04:35.990> I<00:04:36.140> think<00:04:36.710> around<00:04:36.920> 50

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
making an adjustments I think around 50

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.940 
making an adjustments I think around 50
works<00:04:38.060> really<00:04:38.330> well<00:04:38.540> for<00:04:38.600> this<00:04:38.960> image<00:04:39.230> here<00:04:39.440> we

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
works really well for this image here we
