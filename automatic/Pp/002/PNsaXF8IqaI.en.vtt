anyway and have it be a little less than

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.280 
anyway and have it be a little less than
perfect<00:00:21.950> or<00:00:22.550> do<00:00:23.450> I<00:00:23.510> not<00:00:23.660> get<00:00:23.900> it<00:00:24.020> at<00:00:24.110> all

perfect or do I not get it at all

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.320 
perfect or do I not get it at all
because<00:00:24.800> they're<00:00:25.430> just<00:00:25.640> as<00:00:25.760> something<00:00:25.970> that<00:00:26.300> I

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:26.330 
because they're just as something that I

because they're just as something that I
don't<00:00:26.450> like<00:00:26.630> how<00:00:27.620> about<00:00:27.710> a<00:00:27.830> third<00:00:28.130> option<00:00:28.400> get

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.550 
whatever it is that I don't like I
actually<00:00:33.920> prefer<00:00:34.460> the<00:00:34.489> last<00:00:35.000> option<00:00:35.560> often

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:36.560 
actually prefer the last option often

actually prefer the last option often
things<00:00:36.890> aren't<00:00:37.190> perfect<00:00:37.460> out<00:00:37.820> of<00:00:37.880> the<00:00:38.000> box

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:38.060 
things aren't perfect out of the box

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.000 
things aren't perfect out of the box
instead<00:00:39.050> of<00:00:39.110> forgoing<00:00:39.620> them<00:00:39.770> altogether

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
instead of forgoing them altogether

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.430 
instead of forgoing them altogether
though<00:00:40.430> we<00:00:40.970> can<00:00:41.150> make<00:00:41.300> adjustments<00:00:41.420> and<00:00:42.110> that

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
though we can make adjustments and that

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.490 
though we can make adjustments and that
is<00:00:42.590> often<00:00:43.040> a<00:00:43.160> really<00:00:43.610> good<00:00:43.790> solution<00:00:44.320> most<00:00:45.320> of

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
is often a really good solution most of

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.290 
is often a really good solution most of
the<00:00:45.560> time<00:00:45.800> the<00:00:46.070> default<00:00:46.400> animations<00:00:46.610> that<00:00:47.150> we

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
the time the default animations that we

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.300 
the time the default animations that we
can<00:00:47.450> select<00:00:47.660> from<00:00:48.050> the<00:00:48.290> animations<00:00:48.860> gallery

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:49.310 
can select from the animations gallery

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.430 
can select from the animations gallery
or<00:00:49.430> dialog<00:00:49.820> box<00:00:50.060> and<00:00:50.300> PowerPoint<00:00:50.750> will<00:00:51.290> be

or dialog box and PowerPoint will be

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.220 
or dialog box and PowerPoint will be
just<00:00:51.770> fine<00:00:51.980> for<00:00:52.040> our<00:00:52.340> presentations<00:00:52.970> as<00:00:53.090> well

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
just fine for our presentations as well

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.990 
just fine for our presentations as well
but<00:00:54.230> sometimes<00:00:54.800> we<00:00:55.130> need<00:00:55.280> to<00:00:55.370> do<00:00:55.489> something

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
but sometimes we need to do something

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.549 
but sometimes we need to do something
with<00:00:56.149> them<00:00:56.329> in<00:00:56.510> order<00:00:56.809> for<00:00:57.020> them<00:00:57.079> to<00:00:57.170> be<00:00:57.410> the

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
with them in order for them to be the

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:00.100 
with them in order for them to be the
most<00:00:57.739> effective<00:00:58.100> that's<00:00:59.030> when<00:00:59.300> the<00:00:59.450> animation

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110 
most effective that's when the animation

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.530 
most effective that's when the animation
pane<00:01:00.320> becomes<00:01:00.800> useful<00:01:01.220> we<00:01:02.000> can<00:01:02.180> display<00:01:02.510> the

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540

have already been animated in this case
our<00:01:22.400> title<00:01:22.970> has<00:01:23.119> been<00:01:23.150> animated<00:01:23.840> and<00:01:23.960> so<00:01:24.560> has

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
our title has been animated and so has

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.550 
our title has been animated and so has
the<00:01:24.799> chart<00:01:25.840> one<00:01:26.840> of<00:01:26.960> the<00:01:27.020> first<00:01:27.260> things<00:01:27.500> that

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
the chart one of the first things that

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.620 
the chart one of the first things that
we<00:01:27.710> can<00:01:27.860> do<00:01:28.010> very<00:01:28.250> easily<00:01:28.580> with<00:01:29.000> the<00:01:29.030> animation

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
we can do very easily with the animation

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.550 
we can do very easily with the animation
pane<00:01:29.900> is<00:01:30.110> we<00:01:30.320> can<00:01:30.470> reorder<00:01:31.040> the<00:01:31.549> animation<00:01:32.270> in

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
pane is we can reorder the animation in

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.440 
pane is we can reorder the animation in
other<00:01:33.560> words<00:01:33.830> our<00:01:34.010> title<00:01:34.640> is<00:01:34.729> animating<00:01:35.210> first

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
other words our title is animating first

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.289 
other words our title is animating first
and<00:01:35.689> then<00:01:36.380> the<00:01:36.500> chart<00:01:36.740> second<00:01:37.159> if<00:01:37.820> for<00:01:38.270> some

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
and then the chart second if for some

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:40.330 
and then the chart second if for some
reason<00:01:38.720> we<00:01:38.810> wanted<00:01:39.049> to<00:01:39.110> change<00:01:39.380> that<00:01:39.619> we<00:01:40.159> could

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
reason we wanted to change that we could

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.190 
reason we wanted to change that we could
simply<00:01:40.640> grab<00:01:41.180> a<00:01:41.210> hold<00:01:41.479> of<00:01:41.540> one<00:01:41.689> of<00:01:41.720> these<00:01:41.960> and

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
simply grab a hold of one of these and

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.130 
simply grab a hold of one of these and
drag<00:01:43.070> it<00:01:43.220> to<00:01:43.250> a<00:01:43.400> new<00:01:43.580> position

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
drag it to a new position

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.290 
drag it to a new position
now<00:01:45.470> the<00:01:45.530> chart<00:01:45.890> is<00:01:46.040> first<00:01:46.280> and<00:01:46.520> the<00:01:46.850> title<00:01:47.180> is

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
now the chart is first and the title is

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.660 
now the chart is first and the title is
second<00:01:47.690> if<00:01:47.810> we<00:01:48.650> don't<00:01:48.830> like<00:01:49.010> drag<00:01:49.280> and<00:01:49.460> drop

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
second if we don't like drag and drop

upper right hand side of the pane or we

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.690 
upper right hand side of the pane or we

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
can move things up and down and we also

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.550 
can move things up and down and we also

can go up to the ribbon itself and use

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.850 
can go up to the ribbon itself and use

we're<00:02:00.860> going<00:02:00.980> to<00:02:01.040> go<00:02:01.160> ahead<00:02:01.370> and<00:02:01.580> move<00:02:01.700> it<00:02:01.850> back

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
we're going to go ahead and move it back

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.360 
we're going to go ahead and move it back
because<00:02:02.420> we<00:02:02.630> do<00:02:02.960> want<00:02:03.200> the<00:02:03.410> title<00:02:03.680> to<00:02:03.860> animate

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:04.370 
because we do want the title to animate

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.880 
because we do want the title to animate
before<00:02:04.790> the<00:02:04.910> chart<00:02:05.150> one<00:02:06.110> of<00:02:06.229> the<00:02:06.290> things<00:02:06.560> that

before the chart one of the things that

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.070 
before the chart one of the things that
is<00:02:07.010> absolutely<00:02:07.670> critical<00:02:07.970> to<00:02:08.240> understand<00:02:08.840> is

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
is absolutely critical to understand is

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.500 
is absolutely critical to understand is
that<00:02:09.410> when<00:02:09.830> we're<00:02:10.009> animating<00:02:10.490> objects<00:02:11.150> we

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
that when we're animating objects we

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.270 
that when we're animating objects we
have<00:02:11.720> to<00:02:11.870> understand<00:02:12.440> how<00:02:12.709> to<00:02:12.740> work<00:02:12.890> with<00:02:13.040> the

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
have to understand how to work with the

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.460 
have to understand how to work with the
objects<00:02:13.730> just<00:02:14.480> like<00:02:14.600> sometimes<00:02:15.140> we<00:02:15.320> have

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
objects just like sometimes we have

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.710 
objects just like sometimes we have
clipart<00:02:15.950> and<00:02:16.100> after<00:02:16.790> we<00:02:16.880> import<00:02:17.270> the<00:02:17.390> clipart

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
clipart and after we import the clipart

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.690 
clipart and after we import the clipart
we<00:02:18.050> can<00:02:18.230> ungroup<00:02:18.440> it<00:02:18.980> to<00:02:19.100> get<00:02:19.250> to<00:02:19.340> all<00:02:19.459> of<00:02:19.490> the

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
we can ungroup it to get to all of the

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.310 
we can ungroup it to get to all of the
individual<00:02:20.390> elements<00:02:20.510> of<00:02:20.870> the<00:02:20.990> clipart

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
individual elements of the clipart

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.170 
individual elements of the clipart
instead<00:02:21.920> of<00:02:22.040> just<00:02:22.220> the<00:02:22.370> whole<00:02:22.610> thing<00:02:22.880> as<00:02:23.030> one

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
instead of just the whole thing as one

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.840 
instead of just the whole thing as one
picture<00:02:23.630> we<00:02:24.440> can<00:02:24.590> often<00:02:25.040> do<00:02:25.220> the<00:02:25.370> same<00:02:25.610> thing

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
picture we can often do the same thing

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.750 
picture we can often do the same thing
with<00:02:26.000> elements<00:02:26.450> on<00:02:26.600> our<00:02:26.630> slides<00:02:27.550> smart<00:02:28.550> art

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
with elements on our slides smart art

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.080 
with elements on our slides smart art
and<00:02:28.940> even<00:02:29.330> charts<00:02:29.900> and<00:02:30.110> text<00:02:31.010> boxes<00:02:31.400> can<00:02:31.940> all

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
and even charts and text boxes can all

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.699 
and even charts and text boxes can all
be<00:02:32.209> broken<00:02:32.600> down<00:02:32.720> into<00:02:32.989> smaller<00:02:33.440> elements

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
be broken down into smaller elements

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.820 
be broken down into smaller elements
than<00:02:34.340> the<00:02:34.459> whole<00:02:34.640> we<00:02:35.480> have<00:02:35.690> a<00:02:35.720> chart<00:02:36.020> and<00:02:36.290> right

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
than the whole we have a chart and right

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.590 
than the whole we have a chart and right
now<00:02:37.010> this<00:02:37.280> chart<00:02:37.580> is<00:02:37.670> being<00:02:37.880> animated<00:02:38.270> as<00:02:38.540> a

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
now this chart is being animated as a

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.020 
now this chart is being animated as a
single<00:02:39.230> item<00:02:39.380> but<00:02:40.280> what<00:02:40.430> if<00:02:40.520> we<00:02:40.640> wanted<00:02:40.880> to

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
single item but what if we wanted to

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.000 
single item but what if we wanted to
draw<00:02:41.209> attention<00:02:41.330> to<00:02:41.840> specific<00:02:42.140> parts<00:02:42.709> as

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
draw attention to specific parts as

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.250 
draw attention to specific parts as
we're<00:02:43.430> discussing<00:02:43.760> it<00:02:44.030> what<00:02:44.630> we<00:02:44.720> can<00:02:44.870> do<00:02:45.020> that

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
we're discussing it what we can do that

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.199 
we're discussing it what we can do that
but<00:02:45.590> what<00:02:45.739> we<00:02:45.860> need<00:02:46.010> to<00:02:46.130> do<00:02:46.280> is<00:02:46.489> animate<00:02:47.000> it

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
but what we need to do is animate it

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.509 
but what we need to do is animate it
first<00:02:47.600> it<00:02:48.080> has<00:02:48.350> to<00:02:48.530> be<00:02:48.620> visible<00:02:48.860> in<00:02:49.220> our

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
first it has to be visible in our

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.030 
first it has to be visible in our
animation<00:02:49.880> pane<00:02:50.299> then<00:02:51.110> we<00:02:51.260> can<00:02:51.410> use<00:02:51.590> the<00:02:51.799> drop

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
animation pane then we can use the drop

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.380 
animation pane then we can use the drop
down<00:02:52.070> arrow<00:02:52.549> for<00:02:52.640> the<00:02:52.850> element<00:02:53.180> that<00:02:53.239> we're

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
down arrow for the element that we're

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.770 
down arrow for the element that we're
looking<00:02:53.630> at<00:02:53.780> and<00:02:53.959> choose<00:02:54.440> effect<00:02:55.100> options

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
looking at and choose effect options

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.930 
looking at and choose effect options
this<00:02:57.380> is<00:02:57.500> going<00:02:57.709> to<00:02:57.800> open<00:02:57.950> a<00:02:58.280> small<00:02:58.490> window<00:02:58.910> in

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
this is going to open a small window in

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.790 
this is going to open a small window in
the<00:02:59.060> middle<00:02:59.240> of<00:02:59.330> our<00:02:59.390> screen<00:02:59.720> all<00:03:00.319> of<00:03:00.380> our

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
the middle of our screen all of our

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.980 
the middle of our screen all of our
animated<00:03:01.220> objects<00:03:01.670> will<00:03:01.850> have<00:03:01.880> an<00:03:02.209> effect<00:03:02.600> tab

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
animated objects will have an effect tab

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.590 
animated objects will have an effect tab
here<00:03:03.830> we<00:03:03.950> can<00:03:04.100> do<00:03:04.220> things<00:03:04.430> like<00:03:04.610> adding<00:03:05.000> sounds

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
here we can do things like adding sounds

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.300 
here we can do things like adding sounds
but<00:03:06.170> just<00:03:06.380> like<00:03:06.530> adding<00:03:06.860> sounds<00:03:07.190> with

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
but just like adding sounds with

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.400 
but just like adding sounds with
transitions<00:03:07.880> I<00:03:08.150> personally<00:03:09.080> don't<00:03:09.350> think

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
transitions I personally don't think

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.440 
transitions I personally don't think
this<00:03:09.680> is<00:03:09.709> a<00:03:09.800> good<00:03:10.010> idea<00:03:10.340> so<00:03:10.760> I<00:03:10.790> don't<00:03:11.090> use<00:03:11.300> this

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
this is a good idea so I don't use this

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.350 
this is a good idea so I don't use this
option<00:03:11.870> we<00:03:12.560> can<00:03:12.830> choose<00:03:13.190> to<00:03:13.459> dim<00:03:13.760> different

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
option we can choose to dim different

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.449 
option we can choose to dim different
elements<00:03:14.780> after<00:03:14.930> they're<00:03:15.470> animated<00:03:15.830> to<00:03:16.250> help

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
elements after they're animated to help

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.430 
elements after they're animated to help
focus<00:03:16.700> attention<00:03:16.940> on<00:03:17.420> the<00:03:17.510> active<00:03:18.110> part<00:03:18.350> of

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
focus attention on the active part of

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.770 
focus attention on the active part of
the<00:03:18.530> slide<00:03:18.770> and<00:03:19.040> sometimes<00:03:20.000> we<00:03:20.209> can<00:03:20.330> even<00:03:20.630> work

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
the slide and sometimes we can even work

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.930 
the slide and sometimes we can even work
with<00:03:20.989> animating<00:03:21.530> text<00:03:22.010> if<00:03:22.160> we<00:03:22.430> have<00:03:22.580> a<00:03:22.610> text

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
with animating text if we have a text

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.090 
with animating text if we have a text
box<00:03:23.120> selected<00:03:23.330> all<00:03:23.810> of<00:03:24.200> our<00:03:24.650> animated

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
box selected all of our animated

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.120 
box selected all of our animated
elements<00:03:25.310> will<00:03:25.760> also<00:03:26.030> have<00:03:26.239> a<00:03:26.420> timing<00:03:26.750> tab<00:03:27.130> now

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
elements will also have a timing tab now

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:29.740 
elements will also have a timing tab now
we<00:03:28.190> can<00:03:28.400> do<00:03:28.520> some<00:03:28.700> things<00:03:28.910> here<00:03:29.120> as<00:03:29.239> well<00:03:29.420> but

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
we can do some things here as well but

we've<00:05:19.150> broken<00:05:19.390> this<00:05:19.690> one<00:05:19.960> chart<00:05:20.290> down<00:05:20.560> into

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
we've broken this one chart down into

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.970 
we've broken this one chart down into
different<00:05:21.670> pieces<00:05:22.110> we<00:05:23.110> can<00:05:23.230> also<00:05:23.500> see<00:05:23.860> these

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:23.980 
different pieces we can also see these

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.040 
different pieces we can also see these
different<00:05:24.400> pieces<00:05:24.550> in<00:05:24.910> the<00:05:25.330> animation<00:05:25.750> pane

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
different pieces in the animation pane

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.010 
different pieces in the animation pane
itself<00:05:26.260> if<00:05:26.740> we<00:05:27.130> select<00:05:27.760> just<00:05:28.180> the<00:05:28.360> chart<00:05:28.720> five

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.020 
itself if we select just the chart five

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.350 
itself if we select just the chart five
object<00:05:29.800> we<00:05:30.190> can<00:05:30.370> work<00:05:30.550> with<00:05:30.730> all<00:05:30.970> of<00:05:31.000> them<00:05:31.240> at

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
object we can work with all of them at

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.810 
object we can work with all of them at
once<00:05:31.570> but<00:05:32.410> with<00:05:32.590> the<00:05:32.680> little<00:05:32.920> down<00:05:33.130> arrow<00:05:33.160> we

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:33.820 
once but with the little down arrow we

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.240 
once but with the little down arrow we
can<00:05:33.850> also<00:05:34.180> expand<00:05:34.870> it<00:05:35.020> and<00:05:35.140> we<00:05:35.740> now<00:05:35.890> have<00:05:35.920> the

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.250 
can also expand it and we now have the

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.430 
can also expand it and we now have the
ability<00:05:36.340> to<00:05:36.670> work<00:05:36.940> with<00:05:37.000> each<00:05:37.450> independent

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:38.440 
ability to work with each independent

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.440 
ability to work with each independent
part<00:05:38.710> of<00:05:38.890> this<00:05:39.010> chart<00:05:39.310> and<00:05:39.610> animate<00:05:40.330> it

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:40.450 
part of this chart and animate it

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:43.140 
part of this chart and animate it
differently<00:05:40.840> if<00:05:41.140> we<00:05:41.620> wanted<00:05:41.920> to<00:05:41.980> now<00:05:42.910> we<00:05:42.970> have

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.150 
differently if we wanted to now we have

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:44.490 
differently if we wanted to now we have
to<00:05:43.240> be<00:05:43.360> careful<00:05:43.750> because<00:05:43.930> we<00:05:44.170> want<00:05:44.350> to<00:05:44.380> be

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
to be careful because we want to be

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.470 
to be careful because we want to be
consistent<00:05:44.890> but<00:05:45.580> we<00:05:45.700> do<00:05:45.910> now<00:05:46.090> have<00:05:46.330> the

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:46.480 
consistent but we do now have the

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.390 
consistent but we do now have the
capability<00:05:47.140> to<00:05:47.410> work<00:05:47.560> with<00:05:47.740> the<00:05:47.860> individual

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 
capability to work with the individual

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.090 
capability to work with the individual
pieces<00:05:48.930> remember<00:05:49.930> that<00:05:50.320> this<00:05:50.500> type<00:05:50.710> of<00:05:50.740> thing

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:51.100 
pieces remember that this type of thing

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.460 
pieces remember that this type of thing
can<00:05:51.280> be<00:05:51.310> done<00:05:51.580> not<00:05:52.060> only<00:05:52.120> with<00:05:52.450> charts<00:05:52.810> but

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:53.470 
can be done not only with charts but

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.740 
can be done not only with charts but
also<00:05:53.650> with<00:05:53.980> SmartArt<00:05:54.490> and<00:05:54.700> even<00:05:55.300> with<00:05:55.450> text

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:01.990 
slides in at a time well let's look at a

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:03.540 
slides in at a time well let's look at a
couple<00:06:02.140> more<00:06:02.320> things<00:06:02.620> that<00:06:02.800> we<00:06:02.860> can<00:06:03.040> do<00:06:03.190> using

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:03.550 
couple more things that we can do using

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:05.880 
couple more things that we can do using
this<00:06:03.610> wonderful<00:06:04.150> animation<00:06:04.510> pane<00:06:04.870> let's<00:06:05.620> say

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:05.890 
this wonderful animation pane let's say

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:07.380 
this wonderful animation pane let's say
that<00:06:06.010> we've<00:06:06.160> decided<00:06:06.550> that<00:06:06.730> we<00:06:06.880> really<00:06:07.210> don't

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:07.390 
that we've decided that we really don't

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:09.870 
that we've decided that we really don't
want<00:06:07.510> our<00:06:07.900> title<00:06:08.380> to<00:06:08.500> be<00:06:08.620> animated<00:06:09.190> when<00:06:09.760> the

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:09.880 
want our title to be animated when the

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.730 
want our title to be animated when the
slide<00:06:10.150> displays<00:06:10.480> the<00:06:10.990> title<00:06:11.200> can<00:06:11.440> already<00:06:11.650> be

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:11.740 
slide displays the title can already be

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.610 
slide displays the title can already be
in<00:06:11.830> place<00:06:12.330> well<00:06:13.330> from<00:06:13.510> our<00:06:13.690> drop-down<00:06:14.020> edit

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:14.620 
in place well from our drop-down edit

menu we can actually choose to remove

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.830 
menu we can actually choose to remove
any<00:06:17.140> of<00:06:17.350> the<00:06:17.440> animations<00:06:17.770> at<00:06:18.220> any<00:06:18.400> time<00:06:18.840> there

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:19.840 
any of the animations at any time there

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.080 
any of the animations at any time there
we<00:06:19.960> go<00:06:20.110> it's<00:06:20.650> gone<00:06:20.920> and<00:06:21.160> notice<00:06:21.880> that<00:06:21.970> the

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:22.090 
we go it's gone and notice that the

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.940 
we go it's gone and notice that the
animations<00:06:22.630> are<00:06:22.780> now<00:06:22.930> remembered<00:06:23.500> one

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:23.950 
animations are now remembered one

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:25.710 
animations are now remembered one
through<00:06:24.160> five<00:06:24.400> instead<00:06:25.000> of<00:06:25.120> one<00:06:25.240> through<00:06:25.450> six

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:25.720 
through five instead of one through six

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.900 
through five instead of one through six
the<00:06:26.470> other<00:06:26.500> thing<00:06:26.890> that<00:06:26.920> we<00:06:27.130> can<00:06:27.310> do<00:06:27.460> is<00:06:27.640> we<00:06:27.790> can

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:27.910 
the other thing that we can do is we can

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:30.060 
the other thing that we can do is we can
preview<00:06:28.450> different<00:06:28.960> parts<00:06:29.290> of<00:06:29.380> our<00:06:29.470> animation

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:30.070 
preview different parts of our animation

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:33.060 
preview different parts of our animation
now<00:06:30.850> if<00:06:30.910> we<00:06:31.030> go<00:06:31.180> ahead<00:06:31.210> and<00:06:31.720> deselect<00:06:32.020> all<00:06:32.710> of

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:33.070 
now if we go ahead and deselect all of

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:34.980 
now if we go ahead and deselect all of
our<00:06:33.190> different<00:06:33.520> animations<00:06:34.060> we'll<00:06:34.720> see<00:06:34.870> that

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:34.990 
our different animations we'll see that

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:36.720 
our different animations we'll see that
the<00:06:35.140> button<00:06:35.350> at<00:06:35.590> the<00:06:35.800> top<00:06:36.010> of<00:06:36.160> the<00:06:36.250> animation

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:36.730 
the button at the top of the animation

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:39.720 
the button at the top of the animation
pane<00:06:36.940> says<00:06:37.420> play<00:06:37.900> all<00:06:38.140> and<00:06:38.410> if<00:06:39.160> we<00:06:39.280> click<00:06:39.520> or

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:39.730 
pane says play all and if we click or

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:43.580 
pane says play all and if we click or
tap<00:06:40.030> on<00:06:40.240> it<00:06:40.390> it<00:06:40.510> does<00:06:40.960> just<00:06:41.230> that

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:43.590 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:46.100 

if<00:06:43.650> we<00:06:44.130> select<00:06:44.550> one<00:06:44.880> particular<00:06:45.120> number<00:06:45.780> for

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:46.110 
if we select one particular number for

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:48.950 
if we select one particular number for
example<00:06:46.470> we'll<00:06:46.680> do<00:06:46.860> number<00:06:47.130> four<00:06:47.600> then<00:06:48.600> notice

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:48.960 
example we'll do number four then notice

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.570 
example we'll do number four then notice
that<00:06:49.050> the<00:06:49.170> button<00:06:49.410> changes<00:06:49.800> and<00:06:49.980> says<00:06:50.160> play

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:50.580 
that the button changes and says play

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.880 
that the button changes and says play
from<00:06:51.000> so<00:06:51.990> we<00:06:52.050> don't<00:06:52.230> have<00:06:52.350> to<00:06:52.440> see<00:06:52.590> the<00:06:52.710> whole

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:52.890 
from so we don't have to see the whole

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:54.740 
from so we don't have to see the whole
thing<00:06:52.920> but<00:06:53.460> we<00:06:53.700> can<00:06:53.910> basically<00:06:54.090> watch<00:06:54.480> the

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:54.750 
thing but we can basically watch the

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:59.149 
thing but we can basically watch the
ending<00:06:55.110> of<00:06:55.200> the<00:06:55.350> sequence

00:06:59.149 --> 00:06:59.159 

00:06:59.159 --> 00:07:02.179 

so<00:06:59.729> if<00:06:59.999> we<00:07:00.179> select<00:07:00.419> multiple<00:07:01.289> pieces<00:07:01.529> in<00:07:01.919> this

00:07:02.179 --> 00:07:02.189 
so if we select multiple pieces in this

00:07:02.189 --> 00:07:04.369 
so if we select multiple pieces in this
case<00:07:02.399> we'll<00:07:02.639> do<00:07:02.819> two<00:07:03.149> three<00:07:03.479> and<00:07:03.749> four<00:07:04.139> by

00:07:04.369 --> 00:07:04.379 
case we'll do two three and four by

00:07:04.379 --> 00:07:06.649 
case we'll do two three and four by
holding<00:07:04.739> our<00:07:04.830> control<00:07:05.309> key<00:07:05.520> then<00:07:06.209> we<00:07:06.360> see<00:07:06.539> that
