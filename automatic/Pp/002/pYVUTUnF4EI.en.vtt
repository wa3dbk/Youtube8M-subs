00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.880 

I<00:03:52.960> thought<00:03:53.960> that<00:03:54.140> this<00:03:54.200> was<00:03:54.350> pretty<00:03:54.590> cool<00:03:54.800> in

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
I thought that this was pretty cool in

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.350 
I thought that this was pretty cool in
the<00:03:54.980> beginning<00:03:55.280> but<00:03:55.580> since<00:03:55.760> the<00:03:55.880> song<00:03:56.060> repeats

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
the beginning but since the song repeats

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.390 
the beginning but since the song repeats
over<00:03:56.630> and<00:03:56.810> over<00:03:57.110> and<00:03:57.440> over<00:03:57.590> again<00:03:57.830> they<00:03:58.220> both

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
over and over and over again they both

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.250 
over and over and over again they both
become<00:03:58.760> annoying<00:03:59.090> it's<00:03:59.570> not<00:03:59.780> a<00:03:59.810> huge<00:04:00.080> issue

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
become annoying it's not a huge issue

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.170 
become annoying it's not a huge issue
but<00:04:00.530> it<00:04:00.650> can<00:04:00.830> get<00:04:00.980> on<00:04:01.100> your<00:04:01.130> nerves<00:04:01.280> Luigi's

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
but it can get on your nerves Luigi's

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.760 
but it can get on your nerves Luigi's
