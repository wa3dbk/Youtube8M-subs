00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.699 
ribbon goes on and we also have our
reverse<00:02:06.970> transfer<00:02:07.510> where<00:02:08.260> they<00:02:08.410> reverse

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
reverse transfer where they reverse

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.970 
reverse transfer where they reverse
transfer<00:02:09.160> of<00:02:09.280> film<00:02:09.520> goes<00:02:09.790> on<00:02:09.820> to<00:02:10.270> the<00:02:10.390> unit

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:10.980 
transfer of film goes on to the unit

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.710 
transfer of film goes on to the unit
this<00:02:11.980> printing<00:02:12.340> technology<00:02:12.850> actually<00:02:13.060> prints

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
this printing technology actually prints

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.470 
this printing technology actually prints

the cleaning input rollers
these<00:02:45.820> cleaning<00:02:46.239> rollers<00:02:46.570> actually<00:02:47.200> don't

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
these cleaning rollers actually don't

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.229 
these cleaning rollers actually don't
need<00:02:47.830> to<00:02:47.890> be<00:02:48.100> ever<00:02:48.310> replaced<00:02:48.850> these<00:02:49.060> are

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
need to be ever replaced these are

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.270 
need to be ever replaced these are
permanent<00:02:49.510> all<00:02:50.200> you<00:02:50.440> do<00:02:50.560> is<00:02:50.680> just<00:02:50.860> wash<00:02:51.130> them

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
permanent all you do is just wash them

then you can put them right back into

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.130 
then you can put them right back into
the<00:02:57.280> unit<00:02:57.550> if<00:02:57.730> you<00:02:57.790> put<00:02:58.570> someone<00:02:58.870> on<00:02:58.900> this

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
the unit if you put someone on this

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.630 
the unit if you put someone on this
machine<00:02:59.320> and<00:02:59.709> start<00:03:00.070> using<00:03:00.250> this<00:03:00.430> machine

machine and start using this machine

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.520 
machine and start using this machine
you'll<00:03:00.970> find<00:03:01.180> it<00:03:01.300> very<00:03:01.450> simple<00:03:01.870> to<00:03:02.080> use<00:03:02.110> and

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
you'll find it very simple to use and

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.280 
you'll find it very simple to use and
very<00:03:02.560> simple<00:03:03.430> to<00:03:03.550> setup<00:03:03.820> it's<00:03:04.540> so<00:03:04.780> simple<00:03:05.080> you

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
very simple to setup it's so simple you

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.310 
very simple to setup it's so simple you
can<00:03:05.440> see<00:03:05.620> that<00:03:06.190> even<00:03:06.519> on<00:03:06.700> these<00:03:07.000> spools<00:03:07.930> here

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
can see that even on these spools here

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.640 
can see that even on these spools here
it<00:03:08.920> has<00:03:09.160> a<00:03:09.190> diagram<00:03:09.730> inside<00:03:10.209> that<00:03:10.870> shows<00:03:11.230> how

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
it has a diagram inside that shows how

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.160 
it has a diagram inside that shows how
to<00:03:12.340> put<00:03:12.730> the<00:03:12.850> ribbon<00:03:13.000> onto<00:03:13.480> the<00:03:13.570> diagram<00:03:13.989> or

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
to put the ribbon onto the diagram or

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.699 
to put the ribbon onto the diagram or
onto<00:03:14.650> the<00:03:14.739> spool<00:03:15.010> so<00:03:15.220> if<00:03:15.340> you've<00:03:15.489> never<00:03:15.670> setup

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
onto the spool so if you've never setup

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.259 
onto the spool so if you've never setup
reverse<00:03:17.709> transfer<00:03:18.160> film<00:03:18.400> before<00:03:18.730> there's<00:03:19.180> a

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
reverse transfer film before there's a

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:20.699 
reverse transfer film before there's a
really<00:03:19.510> easy<00:03:19.720> to<00:03:19.930> use<00:03:20.049> diagrams<00:03:20.500> that<00:03:20.620> are

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
really easy to use diagrams that are

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:21.930 
really easy to use diagrams that are
actually<00:03:20.950> on<00:03:21.040> both<00:03:21.190> of<00:03:21.340> these<00:03:21.430> schools<00:03:21.760> it

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
actually on both of these schools it

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.449 
actually on both of these schools it
looks<00:03:22.090> like<00:03:22.350> so<00:03:23.350> this<00:03:23.500> is<00:03:23.620> the<00:03:23.739> printing<00:03:24.160> unit

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
looks like so this is the printing unit

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.550 
looks like so this is the printing unit
of<00:03:24.640> the<00:03:24.730> Prima<00:03:25.090> and<00:03:25.780> let's<00:03:26.110> go<00:03:26.230> ahead<00:03:26.350> and<00:03:26.470> take

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
of the Prima and let's go ahead and take

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.620 
of the Prima and let's go ahead and take
a<00:03:26.590> look<00:03:26.799> at<00:03:26.980> the<00:03:27.130> lamination<00:03:27.820> you<00:03:27.970> know<00:03:28.090> just

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
a look at the lamination you know just

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.720 
a look at the lamination you know just
like<00:03:28.900> the<00:03:29.170> printing<00:03:29.769> unit<00:03:30.040> you<00:03:30.160> have<00:03:30.190> three

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
like the printing unit you have three

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.229 
like the printing unit you have three
power<00:03:31.060> cables<00:03:31.620> at<00:03:32.620> all<00:03:33.180> correspond<00:03:34.180> to

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
power cables at all correspond to

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:34.770 
power cables at all correspond to
different

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
different

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.270 
different
regions<00:03:35.319> and<00:03:35.470> you<00:03:36.310> get<00:03:36.550> to<00:03:37.890> transfer<00:03:38.890> take-up

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
regions and you get to transfer take-up

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.940 
regions and you get to transfer take-up
rollers<00:03:39.790> so<00:03:40.000> these<00:03:40.150> are<00:03:40.510> take-up<00:03:41.319> rollers<00:03:41.770> for

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
rollers so these are take-up rollers for

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.840 
rollers so these are take-up rollers for
your<00:03:42.100> lamination<00:03:42.670> film<00:03:44.280> so<00:03:45.280> the<00:03:45.370> lamination

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
your lamination film so the lamination

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.660 
your lamination film so the lamination
unit<00:03:46.150> is<00:03:46.270> actually<00:03:46.510> built<00:03:47.140> very<00:03:47.740> similar<00:03:48.370> to

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
unit is actually built very similar to

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.130 
unit is actually built very similar to
the<00:03:48.880> printing<00:03:49.209> unit<00:03:49.420> it's<00:03:49.600> slightly<00:03:49.810> taller

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
the printing unit it's slightly taller

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.960 
the printing unit it's slightly taller
you<00:03:50.830> can<00:03:50.980> see<00:03:51.130> it's<00:03:51.250> still<00:03:51.400> at<00:03:51.550> that<00:03:51.700> nice

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
you can see it's still at that nice

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.570 
you can see it's still at that nice
color<00:03:52.600> coating<00:03:53.170> this<00:03:53.830> is<00:03:53.950> a<00:03:53.980> double-sided

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
color coating this is a double-sided

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.460 
color coating this is a double-sided
lamination<00:03:55.120> unit<00:03:55.540> so<00:03:55.840> it<00:03:56.110> can<00:03:56.319> actually

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
lamination unit so it can actually

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.280 
lamination unit so it can actually
laminate<00:03:57.250> both<00:03:57.489> sides<00:03:57.819> of<00:03:58.000> the<00:03:58.060> card<00:03:58.360> with<00:03:58.989> one

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
laminate both sides of the card with one

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.220 
laminate both sides of the card with one
pass<00:03:59.620> and<00:04:00.010> it<00:04:00.160> does<00:04:00.370> that<00:04:00.550> by<00:04:00.730> having<00:04:01.000> a<00:04:01.270> top

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
pass and it does that by having a top

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.500 
pass and it does that by having a top
lamination<00:04:02.920> film<00:04:03.160> and<00:04:03.400> a<00:04:03.550> bottom<00:04:03.970> lamination
