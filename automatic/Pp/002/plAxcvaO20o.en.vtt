00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 hello everyone together and warmly 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.450
 Welcome to a new book 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:09.559
 pretend I read the 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.870
 taste of luck by jennifer smith 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:17.609
 the book is about elli and um 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:19.980
 Graham Graham is a very successful 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.769
 movie star 17 years old has totally the 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.740
 Breakthrough and is hot from all 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.199
 but really desires lonely 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.090
 because he never knows if the people because 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.090
 really like him or just 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.820
 his career admire his money in 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.670
 whatever claim yes 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:43.410
 and elli is a 16 year old girl 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:46.320
 anna lives more in a small town 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.539
 Maine and indeed the place is called Henley 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.610
 I mean, I do not really care how 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.949
 there definitely is one 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.640
 very quiet life there by chance 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.010
 It's happened that Graham sent an e-mail 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.199
 ally sent he actually wanted one 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.290
 driving friend and has mistyped 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.270
 and so the e-mail ends up in the mailbox 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.090
 the two write back and forth 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.150
 and that goes on for months so far 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.920
 well the prologue is actually this 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.869
 months we wrote 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.100
 get equal with the situation as the 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.930
 get to know each other and one 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.580
 exchange a bit with each other and 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.070
 three months later, the 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.430
 history the two write themselves 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.049
 still and elli is always very 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.909
 I get excited every morning when she is 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.100
 wakes up she does okay now I have 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.689
 get another mail from this one 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.720
 unknown ones have no names 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:39.299
 exchanged nothing that only know that 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.610
 So honestly only knows that he ge 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.880
 starts and graham just knows that honestly 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.780
 each begins so who else does 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.490
 not exchanged 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.159
 I do not know that he is famous or 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.479
 something else and yes but the two are coming 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.970
 but more and it is a very 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.409
 beautiful very nice font exchange 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.460
 stand the two have each other 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:02.460
 now it comes that the brake new film 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.159
 just turned in the place 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.259
 Let's live by lending that is 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.970
 but no coincidence because bremen has 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.090
 found out through the e-mails 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.010
 heard out where elite 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.110
 lives and has arranged so that the 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.580
 film is shot there just because 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.860
 he can not wait anymore he wants 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.940
 you necessarily get to know them because he has 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.349
 a little bit in love with her 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.569
 In the end it comes that the 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:31.160
 Of course, both must meet first 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:34.160
 let's explain who he is and how me 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.900
 the thought is the total freak out and 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.819
 It's nice to see you over months now 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.340
 already wrote with a movie star 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.720
 no, she tries to distance herself 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.790
 and why that is 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.880
 You have to find out for yourself 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.310
 this book on the facts it is in 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:55.959
 carlsen publisher costs 17 euro 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:58.370
 90 and hartmann 364 pages 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.769
 I was very excited about the book it 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.010
 should actually appear on 25 17 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:06.379
 loud amazon I was so today today 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.780
 the 25th seventh you get the video 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:12.530
 Rank 26 victories in any case rich 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.700
 tuesday in the hugendubel and if so 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.739
 long lines have seen the book 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.500
 not so god i have to have it 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:20.120
 Immediately because it's the author, too 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.220
 the statistical probability of 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.230
 love written at first sight 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:28.489
 has and the book is one of my 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.959
 absolute favorite books back i 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.489
 I read this last year 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.480
 year read both times five stars from 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:34.910
 That's why I was 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.200
 incredibly excited because as 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.790
 this book should be and the 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.010
 history has become really interesting 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.599
 listened to last the book of 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.769
 I get four stars for me 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:44.359
 I think it's a pity 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:45.739
 actually with the expected turn 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:49.069
 that's possible 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:51.410
 pretty sure five stars will be snappy 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:53.450
 unfortunately not become but in itself has 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.190
 I like the story very much 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.099
 the characters liked it a lot 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:00.340
 yes you can say that's it 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:02.959
 a little bit 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.940
 she did not reinvent the wheel 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:07.519
 you have to say that but just 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:10.669
 Still, it was very nice to read the 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:13.130
 the story of headley and oliver 

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:15.620
 I think they will be happy 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.209
 So feel comfortable in the book as well 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.190
 I think partly has the wife 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.530
 unbelievably great expressions you 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.520
 just use 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.810
 I just liked it so much 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.430
 I can not play that and 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:31.870
 it's really nothing special 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:33.760
 is in simple words a feeling too 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.260
 describe what do I do not know me 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.600
 I can not describe it, I think 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:40.270
 It was wonderful, I was able to do it very well 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.430
 suffering is not the fastest 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.810
 History is not happening so much 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.160
 So, as I said, the people are the 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.050
 maybe the statistical as well 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.120
 Probability sheet ablas not 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.250
 they suffer could be the 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.810
 probably also can not stand 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.700
 they did that 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.900
 I also like to write about it 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.730
 I think a little bit if now 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.550
 it can be estimated this time 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:03.570
 that for the 17 euro 90 actually 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:05.650
 but a little more pages gets yes 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:07.540
 So I have to say that 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.430
 from me is a recommendation to me 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:14.050
 personally liked it on something like that 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:16.450
 but not the absolute mega 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.100
 history awaits with incredible 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.750
 many uses or something else 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.910
 a bit predictable 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.380
 I like that change quite so much 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:26.410
 I would have a chapter after all 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:29.520
 wanted but where should I go 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:31.120
 I can write myself 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.890
 otherwise it is still one 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:39.220
 recommendation for me all the on so 

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:42.400
 loose easy stories stand with 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:45.000
 love because the thieves again here 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:48.010
 not here again as the 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.030
 the largest space I have found 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:50.560
 already at the statistical 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:53.470
 Probably it was about 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.030
 the love at first sight but there 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:56.500
 then played a bit more 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:59.919
 with pure and I think so too 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:03.070
 just that graham feels yes 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:05.500
 the famous movie star and that he himself 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:08.919
 actually just feels pretty lonely and 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:11.169
 which also has secrets and one 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:13.780
 Past with it really 

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:16.750
 difficult to complete and yes 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:18.250
 so I personally have very good 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:20.979
 please have a look at it in any case 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:22.419
 I did not regret it and it 

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:27.310
 It could happen that I do it again 

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:28.930
 But do not read in the near future hope 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:30.340
 the video has told you or falls to me 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:32.770
 what I wanted to ask you 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:34.009
 namely here the spectator now at 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:37.039
 a book presentation 

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:38.749
 I would be interested looks him 

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:40.909
 a book presentation of the video easy 

00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:43.699
 just because it comes from me now so 

00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:45.050
 because you 're leaving me ok that's about now 

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:46.219
 a little self-indulgent but me 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:48.259
 I think I know what I mean 

00:06:46.219 --> 00:06:50.419
 or you just watch the videos 

00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:52.460
 if you are really interested in the book 

00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:53.960
 or you just watch the video 

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:56.300
 if you already read the book yourself 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.050
 I believe a fourth possibility 

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.789
 did not exist 

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:02.559
 I would just be interested 

00:06:58.789 --> 00:07:05.020
 when her book spits video presentation video 

00:07:02.559 --> 00:07:08.449
 that was the word for it now 

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:10.539
 weekend if you do see it in yes 

00:07:08.449 --> 00:07:12.139
 weeks shirt 

00:07:10.539 --> 00:07:14.629
 I wish you one more 

00:07:12.139 --> 00:07:17.740
 beautiful day reason say bye 

00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:17.740
 see you next time
