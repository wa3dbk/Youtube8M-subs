00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.210
 I started rugby in the city where 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:13.110
 I was born, that is to say, ah 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.400
 yet here in the 91 in essonne game 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.870
 rugby school there that's where I 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.470
 just learned all these values 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.619
 rugby 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.410
 the spirit of winning the fight and also 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.210
 of mostly two groups and I still 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.849
 my best friends there I left 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.619
 set of dax formations in the 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.570
 southwest where I stayed four years 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:35.100
 so here after that with me if 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.840
 I lived the climb in pro d2 and there 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.920
 last year we went down and I 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.899
 arrived at nevers 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.170
 I think we have about 40 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.660
 players we are about three minimum 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.670
 even four per post so he goes there 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.140
 have a lot of competition so this 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.940
 who pushes us who will allow us 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.860
 individually forever players 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.630
 push ourselves back into our limits for 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.370
 to be able to have precisely to be able to 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.560
 win his place and deserved it I play 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.420
 center or back but rather center to 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.980
 this post but what it takes is 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.750
 already be very solid in defense I 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.489
 think it starts there after a 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.590
 three quarters must know how to do it all 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.110
 to say defend attack hit hit do 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.880
 passes so you also need to know 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.369
 to be complete but I think my 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.299
 strengths are the penetration and the 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:20.340
 defense I played judge or perigueux 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:24.210
 until I turned 18 when I did a 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:28.229
 hour a year in pro d 2 of the game 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:31.350
 2 in 1 biarritz here I could I could 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.900
 so play a little the crates that get 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.290
 was doing better at this moment one is following 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.750
 I left in pro d2 in bordeaux where 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.799
 I spent two years followed by four years 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:46.229
 at mont de marsan and here I am at 9:15 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:50.040
 a month I think are not going to force the game 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.680
 So here at the foot it is an area that 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.820
 that I like a lot 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.700
 with I have a lot of fun and even 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.780
 the drive to type for a it's not 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.759
 at all the compulsion of these whores 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.860
 pleasure so since very small I 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.520
 have fun typing 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:07.640
 it stayed I appreciate I appreciate this 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.670
 area of ​​play Thursday it's clues and 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.590
 back so these two posts 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:15.170
 this is rather different so it's true 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.310
 that says it's not bad because what 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.230
 you pass on the game inquired 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.030
 influential who leads his team who 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.220
 influence the game 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.400
 so you can it's a post to 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.450
 responsibilities that pleases me at the back 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.550
 the back you are no longer the last rampart 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.160
 in defense under the candles but 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.200
 Here necessarily wanted head was 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.110
 because otherwise it can be 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.520
 very complicated for the team and that's it 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:42.080
 it's quite different posts but 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:44.750
 but i appreciate it just as much yeah but 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.459
 enter the rugby issue at the most 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.780
 great sport in fact is that that 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.120
 football in France 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:53.970
 and since I handed gt 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:57.450
 we must and after the last time 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:02.580
 i was sure on earth i'm crazy about 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:05.610
 rugby and after that play at school after 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:08.579
 the col I played with the bulls - - ben 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.890
 and after that I was with western 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:14.430
 province and the stormers until 2000 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:18.329
 2011 and after that I go to France for 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:21.930
 play with montpellier the years 2011 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:24.720
 and 2012 and this year I'm here a 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.940
 glass I really like the work on the 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.239
 rock on the pack h 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:33.450
 we attack I pose y mc hammer 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:35.160
 I have trouble with a match I am I 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.739
 I'm dead I like it after every game 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.900
 is all because for me it is 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:42.930
 really a said I want my body I 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.359
 think is attributed these of Africans I 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.129
 think it's because we like it we like 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:47.849
 rugby because it's he has a lot of 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:50.909
 contacts 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:53.760
 it's good with the spirit in the team 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:55.349
 all this no I like it I like it 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.380
 play every game is young so everything 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:04:00.660
 for for my friend all that here I have 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:04.680
 started rugby at the Pau section 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:07.049
 I left then at the age of 18 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.900
 at castres where I made the center of 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:11.190
 training I then decided to sign 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.980
 to tarbes because I had the opportunity 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:16.859
 to integrate the pro group to be to be 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:21.000
 third of scrum I did two 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:22.349
 years with pros in pro d2 at tpr people 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.060
 were looking for a domain of a 

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:27.090
 half- scorer scorer to these youngsters who 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.430
 integrate into the deluz sony project 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.789
 there he thought of me so is today 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.320
 to be able to get a contract to prove 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:36.060
 of professional players or game where I 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.260
 will only live from my passion and I 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.880
 will get up every morning to go 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.590
 train and play a game on 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.560
 Sunday is really an opportunity 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:46.349
 which was not unreasonable and that's 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.470
 extraordinary is my father a little who 

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:51.760
 transmitted to me 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:55.110
 rugby he was a player and then he has 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:57.270
 trained so very early at the age of 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.170
 from 4 years he brought me he led me to 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.480
 club in argentina 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:03.480
 just half scrum or half opening 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:06.390
 we must first put well 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.440
 in place or direct the players 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.350
 for 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:13.590
 so we can do what we do 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.880
 behind and now enjoy the moments of 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.420
 highlights of the team to score 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:20.150
 and that or manage 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:24.020
 the weak times for it to happen 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:25.910
 the best and it's high positions at 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.130
 strong pressure we will say so it takes 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.390
 know how to manage that too and it's a pleasure 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:31.040
 really fun for a player and 

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:33.920
 evolve in spheres 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.970
 infrastructure like that because because 

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:38.690
 that's not the case in all the glare 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:42.400
 with them and that here is really stop 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:42.400
 have a strong point of winter 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:06:11.930
 all this to young naruto
