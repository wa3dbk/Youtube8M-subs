00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
together the same look as you see in

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.910 
together the same look as you see in
this<00:00:53.250> video<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:54.480> would<00:00:54.750> say<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.590> first<00:00:55.800> thing

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
this video I would say the first thing

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.860 
this video I would say the first thing
you<00:00:56.010> need<00:00:56.129> is<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.489> have<00:00:56.640> just<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.510> little<00:00:57.629> bit<00:00:57.719> of

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
you need is to have just a little bit of

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.130 
you need is to have just a little bit of
courage<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.500> mix<00:00:59.340> patterns<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.239> textures<00:01:00.660> and

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
courage to mix patterns and textures and

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.529 
courage to mix patterns and textures and
stuff<00:01:01.320> because<00:01:01.410> it's<00:01:01.680> sometimes<00:01:02.270> like<00:01:03.270> happy

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
stuff because it's sometimes like happy

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.149 
stuff because it's sometimes like happy
accidents<00:01:04.049> might<00:01:04.290> work<00:01:04.500> so<00:01:04.710> I<00:01:04.739> think<00:01:04.860> just

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
accidents might work so I think just

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.580 
accidents might work so I think just
having<00:01:05.309> like<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:06.299> feeling<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:07.080> anything

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
having like the feeling that anything

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.109 
having like the feeling that anything
could<00:01:07.799> work<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.220> just<00:01:08.400> kind<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.640> keep<00:01:08.850> trying

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
could work and just kind of keep trying

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.149 
could work and just kind of keep trying
and<00:01:09.330> playing<00:01:09.540> but<00:01:09.869> like<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:10.560> know<00:01:10.590> even<00:01:11.040> look

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
and playing but like you know even look

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.740 
and playing but like you know even look
like<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.460> denim<00:01:11.760> if<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:11.970> have<00:01:12.150> like<00:01:12.330> stripes

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
like the denim if you have like stripes

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.600 
like the denim if you have like stripes
or<00:01:12.930> polka<00:01:13.110> dots<00:01:13.380> like<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:14.340> might<00:01:14.490> not

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
or polka dots like that you might not

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.219 
or polka dots like that you might not
think<00:01:14.850> would<00:01:15.119> work<00:01:15.330> with<00:01:15.570> like<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:15.750> floral

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
think would work with like a floral

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.950 
think would work with like a floral
print<00:01:16.409> but<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:17.070> think<00:01:17.520> that<00:01:17.670> it<00:01:17.759> does<00:01:17.939> but<00:01:18.810> it's

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
print but I think that it does but it's

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.640 
print but I think that it does but it's
also<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.320> know<00:01:19.470> fashion<00:01:19.890> is<00:01:20.100> very<00:01:20.130> open<00:01:20.549> to

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
also you know fashion is very open to

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.050 
also you know fashion is very open to
interpretation<00:01:22.650> but<00:01:23.189> I<00:01:23.250> think<00:01:23.490> that<00:01:23.640> mixing

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
interpretation but I think that mixing

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.420 
interpretation but I think that mixing
patterns<00:01:24.840> like<00:01:25.080> florals<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.619> polka<00:01:25.950> dots<00:01:26.100> or

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
patterns like florals and polka dots or

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.480 
patterns like florals and polka dots or
you<00:01:27.210> know<00:01:27.299> stripes<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.680> like<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.159> leopard

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
you know stripes and like a leopard

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.859 
you know stripes and like a leopard
print<00:01:29.729> or<00:01:29.820> something<00:01:30.150> it's<00:01:30.390> like<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.630> kind<00:01:30.810> of
