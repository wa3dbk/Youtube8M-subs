00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
watch this one so in our previous

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.470 
watch this one so in our previous
presentations<00:00:31.400> we<00:00:31.610> talked<00:00:31.820> about<00:00:31.940> how<00:00:32.180> water

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
presentations we talked about how water

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.240 
presentations we talked about how water
selectively<00:00:33.079> filters<00:00:33.649> out<00:00:33.829> various

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
selectively filters out various

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.430 
selectively filters out various
wavelengths<00:00:34.460> of<00:00:34.850> light<00:00:34.879> and<00:00:35.300> in<00:00:35.750> so<00:00:35.990> doing<00:00:36.020> it

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
wavelengths of light and in so doing it

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.010 
wavelengths of light and in so doing it
reduces<00:00:36.920> the<00:00:37.040> visibility<00:00:37.370> of<00:00:37.700> some<00:00:37.910> colors<00:00:38.180> so

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
reduces the visibility of some colors so

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.720 
reduces the visibility of some colors so
in<00:00:39.140> a<00:00:39.170> typical<00:00:39.350> conditions<00:00:40.010> we<00:00:40.160> found<00:00:40.460> that

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
in a typical conditions we found that

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.940 
in a typical conditions we found that
reds<00:00:41.210> and<00:00:41.480> oranges<00:00:41.630> might<00:00:42.200> only<00:00:42.350> get<00:00:42.530> down<00:00:42.739> to

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:42.950 
reds and oranges might only get down to

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.370 
reds and oranges might only get down to
about<00:00:43.100> five<00:00:43.550> to<00:00:43.790> eight<00:00:43.850> meters<00:00:44.090> or<00:00:44.510> 17<00:00:44.989> to<00:00:45.110> 20

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:45.380

feet but under dirty water conditions

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.600 
feet but under dirty water conditions
it's<00:00:53.870> a<00:00:53.930> very<00:00:54.200> different<00:00:54.440> story<00:00:54.800> so<00:00:55.130> let's

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
it's a very different story so let's

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.490 
it's a very different story so let's
have<00:00:55.730> a<00:00:55.790> look<00:00:55.970> now<00:00:56.000> at<00:00:56.239> how<00:00:56.390> dirty<00:00:56.840> water<00:00:57.230> makes

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
have a look now at how dirty water makes

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.090 
have a look now at how dirty water makes
our<00:00:57.649> lures<00:00:57.890> look<00:00:58.220> to<00:00:58.370> fish<00:00:58.550> and<00:00:59.360> to<00:00:59.890> do<00:01:00.890> that

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
our lures look to fish and to do that

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.709 
our lures look to fish and to do that
we're<00:01:01.309> going<00:01:01.430> to<00:01:01.520> split<00:01:01.760> a<00:01:01.850> little<00:01:01.969> box<00:01:02.360> up<00:01:02.570> and

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
we're going to split a little box up and

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:04.389 
we're going to split a little box up and
begin<00:01:03.050> to<00:01:03.140> look<00:01:03.290> at<00:01:03.440> dirty<00:01:03.950> water<00:01:04.159> and<00:01:04.250> clean

00:01:04.389 --> 00:01:04.399 
begin to look at dirty water and clean

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:06.130 
begin to look at dirty water and clean
water<00:01:04.729> side<00:01:05.059> by<00:01:05.239> sides<00:01:05.509> you<00:01:05.719> can<00:01:05.869> do<00:01:05.960> a<00:01:05.990> direct

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
water side by sides you can do a direct

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.310 
water side by sides you can do a direct
comparison<00:01:06.729> so<00:01:07.729> let's<00:01:07.909> start<00:01:08.240> now<00:01:08.450> by<00:01:08.780> filling

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
comparison so let's start now by filling

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.080 
comparison so let's start now by filling
up<00:01:09.440> one<00:01:09.650> side<00:01:09.920> the<00:01:10.100> right-hand<00:01:10.490> side<00:01:10.760> of<00:01:10.790> our

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
up one side the right-hand side of our

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.380 
up one side the right-hand side of our
box<00:01:12.049> with<00:01:12.440> dirty<00:01:12.770> water<00:01:12.890> you<00:01:13.310> can<00:01:13.909> see<00:01:14.120> already

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
box with dirty water you can see already

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:15.490 
box with dirty water you can see already
that<00:01:14.510> there's<00:01:14.750> a<00:01:14.780> bit<00:01:14.900> of<00:01:14.990> a<00:01:15.049> change<00:01:15.290> in<00:01:15.409> the

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
that there's a bit of a change in the

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.910 
that there's a bit of a change in the
colors<00:01:15.799> there<00:01:16.780> and<00:01:17.780> we're<00:01:18.409> going<00:01:18.530> to<00:01:18.560> go<00:01:18.710> back

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
colors there and we're going to go back

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.680 
colors there and we're going to go back
and<00:01:19.070> use<00:01:19.250> the<00:01:19.430> same<00:01:19.640> two<00:01:19.850> lures<00:01:20.119> used<00:01:20.540> in

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
and use the same two lures used in

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.000 
and use the same two lures used in
previous<00:01:20.869> presentations<00:01:21.740> that<00:01:21.890> are

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.010 
previous presentations that are

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.070 
previous presentations that are
multicolored<00:01:22.670> so<00:01:22.820> we<00:01:22.940> can<00:01:23.090> see<00:01:23.299> how<00:01:23.510> each<00:01:24.020> of

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
multicolored so we can see how each of

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.630 
multicolored so we can see how each of
the<00:01:24.320> different<00:01:24.440> colors<00:01:24.920> is<00:01:25.040> affected<00:01:25.460> by<00:01:25.580> the

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
the different colors is affected by the

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.260 
the different colors is affected by the
water<00:01:25.850> conditions<00:01:26.299> so<00:01:27.020> let's<00:01:27.200> start<00:01:28.210> okay<00:01:29.210> so

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
water conditions so let's start okay so

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.000 
water conditions so let's start okay so
let's<00:01:29.570> start<00:01:29.780> dropping<00:01:30.229> these<00:01:30.350> lures<00:01:30.650> down

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 
let's start dropping these lures down

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.010 
let's start dropping these lures down
into<00:01:31.220> the<00:01:31.340> depth<00:01:31.549> shell<00:01:31.820> we<00:01:31.909> what<00:01:32.750> you<00:01:32.780> notice

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
into the depth shell we what you notice

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.719 
into the depth shell we what you notice
is<00:01:33.290> on<00:01:33.470> the<00:01:33.650> right<00:01:33.950> hand<00:01:33.979> side<00:01:34.400> the<00:01:34.580> lure

the lure in the dirty water really has

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
lost all of its color okay so let's put

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.030 
lost all of its color okay so let's put
all<00:02:25.660> those<00:02:25.870> lures<00:02:26.140> back<00:02:26.410> on<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:26.650> screen<00:02:26.920> at

all those lures back on the screen at

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.590 
all those lures back on the screen at
one<00:02:27.160> times<00:02:27.460> you<00:02:27.700> can<00:02:27.850> do<00:02:27.940> a<00:02:27.970> direct<00:02:28.120> comparison

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
one times you can do a direct comparison

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.780 
one times you can do a direct comparison
and<00:02:29.320> you<00:02:29.350> can<00:02:29.860> see<00:02:30.070> that<00:02:30.280> there<00:02:30.400> is<00:02:30.430> quite<00:02:30.580> a

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
and you can see that there is quite a

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.670 
and you can see that there is quite a
bit<00:02:30.970> of<00:02:31.060> difference<00:02:31.330> between<00:02:31.450> the<00:02:32.290> colors

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
bit of difference between the colors

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.770 
bit of difference between the colors
that<00:02:32.770> are<00:02:32.860> visible<00:02:33.130> in<00:02:33.460> clear<00:02:34.360> water<00:02:34.540> as

that are visible in clear water as

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
compared to the colors that are visible

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.420 
compared to the colors that are visible
in<00:02:36.370> dirty<00:02:36.760> water<00:02:36.790> as<00:02:38.130> always<00:02:39.130> for<00:02:39.310> these

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
in dirty water as always for these

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:40.890 
in dirty water as always for these
presentations<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:40.390> depths<00:02:40.720> that<00:02:40.750> I'm

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
presentations the depths that I'm

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.090 
presentations the depths that I'm
putting<00:02:41.020> up<00:02:41.140> on<00:02:41.320> the<00:02:41.410> screen<00:02:41.710> are<00:02:41.860> indicative

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
putting up on the screen are indicative

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.730 
putting up on the screen are indicative
only<00:02:42.610> of<00:02:43.300> course<00:02:43.540> in<00:02:43.750> really<00:02:44.170> dirty<00:02:44.380> water

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
only of course in really dirty water

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.350 
only of course in really dirty water
those<00:02:45.190> depths<00:02:45.490> will<00:02:45.610> be<00:02:45.730> significantly

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
those depths will be significantly

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.090 
those depths will be significantly
reduced<00:02:46.510> and<00:02:46.960> in<00:02:47.110> fact<00:02:47.350> reds<00:02:47.650> oranges<00:02:47.890> and

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
reduced and in fact reds oranges and

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.220 
reduced and in fact reds oranges and
yellows<00:02:48.250> might<00:02:49.120> not<00:02:49.270> even<00:02:49.390> be<00:02:49.600> visible<00:02:49.630> more

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
yellows might not even be visible more

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.670 
yellows might not even be visible more
than<00:02:50.380> inch<00:02:50.530> or<00:02:50.680> two<00:02:50.800> below<00:02:50.950> the<00:02:51.130> water<00:02:51.310> surface

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
than inch or two below the water surface

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.960 
than inch or two below the water surface
so<00:02:53.680> you<00:02:53.740> can<00:02:53.950> use<00:02:54.160> this<00:02:54.280> information<00:02:54.460> by

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
so you can use this information by

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.970 
so you can use this information by
realizing<00:02:55.570> that<00:02:55.600> reds<00:02:55.990> and<00:02:56.200> oranges<00:02:56.380> and<00:02:56.860> to<00:02:56.950> a

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
realizing that reds and oranges and to a

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.470 
realizing that reds and oranges and to a
lesser<00:02:57.070> extent<00:02:57.250> yellows<00:02:57.910> become<00:02:58.300> less

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
lesser extent yellows become less

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.030 
lesser extent yellows become less
effective<00:02:58.840> when<00:02:59.140> the<00:02:59.260> water<00:02:59.410> becomes<00:02:59.770> dirty

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
effective when the water becomes dirty

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.280 
effective when the water becomes dirty
and<00:03:00.400> what<00:03:00.940> you<00:03:01.030> can<00:03:01.180> do<00:03:01.330> is<00:03:01.480> use<00:03:01.690> darker<00:03:02.080> cutter

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
and what you can do is use darker cutter

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.260 
and what you can do is use darker cutter
lures<00:03:02.560> have<00:03:02.860> stronger<00:03:03.370> actions<00:03:03.760> so<00:03:03.940> the<00:03:04.090> fish

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
lures have stronger actions so the fish

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:05.790 
lures have stronger actions so the fish
are<00:03:04.420> feeling<00:03:04.810> the<00:03:04.900> lures<00:03:05.140> rather<00:03:05.350> than<00:03:05.560> seeing

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
are feeling the lures rather than seeing

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.440 
are feeling the lures rather than seeing
them<00:03:05.980> and<00:03:06.130> the<00:03:06.490> dark<00:03:06.760> color<00:03:07.030> gives<00:03:07.300> them<00:03:07.390> a

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
them and the dark color gives them a

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.270 
them and the dark color gives them a
stronger<00:03:07.690> silhouette<00:03:08.260> that<00:03:08.890> will<00:03:09.010> improve

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
stronger silhouette that will improve

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.810 
stronger silhouette that will improve
your<00:03:09.400> catches<00:03:09.790> in<00:03:09.910> dirty<00:03:10.180> water<00:03:10.210> and<00:03:11.820> once
