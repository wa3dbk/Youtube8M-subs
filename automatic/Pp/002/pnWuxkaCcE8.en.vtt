the sugar pill I'm missing out on a bit
of<00:00:28.820> a<00:00:28.939> treat<00:00:29.150> here<00:00:29.390> because<00:00:29.689> women<00:00:30.619> of<00:00:30.740> color

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 
of a treat here because women of color

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.250 
of a treat here because women of color
have<00:00:31.400> a<00:00:31.730> hard<00:00:32.210> time<00:00:32.450> sometimes<00:00:32.660> picking

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.450 
have a hard time sometimes picking
eyeshadows<00:00:33.800> because<00:00:34.100> the<00:00:34.220> pigment

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
eyeshadows because the pigment

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.430 
eyeshadows because the pigment
oftentimes<00:00:35.329> isn't<00:00:35.630> strong<00:00:35.900> enough<00:00:36.079> to<00:00:36.230> show

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
oftentimes isn't strong enough to show

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.350 
oftentimes isn't strong enough to show
up<00:00:36.530> on<00:00:36.680> the<00:00:36.770> skin<00:00:37.070> and<00:00:37.310> this<00:00:37.760> can<00:00:37.970> be<00:00:38.090> a<00:00:38.120> problem

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
up on the skin and this can be a problem

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.070 
up on the skin and this can be a problem
and<00:00:39.610> the<00:00:40.610> sugar<00:00:40.850> pill<00:00:41.060> really<00:00:41.420> should<00:00:41.690> be<00:00:41.840> kind

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:42.080 
and the sugar pill really should be kind

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
think i actually think that these are

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.740 
think i actually think that these are
incredibly<00:02:42.520> good<00:02:42.760> what<00:02:43.240> i'd<00:02:43.330> like<00:02:43.480> to<00:02:43.540> see

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
incredibly good what i'd like to see

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.330 
incredibly good what i'd like to see
more<00:02:43.900> neutral<00:02:44.320> tones<00:02:44.560> because<00:02:44.830> that's<00:02:45.190> just

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
more neutral tones because that's just

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.580 
more neutral tones because that's just
my<00:02:45.550> preference<00:02:45.820> i<00:02:46.300> think<00:02:47.080> that<00:02:47.230> these<00:02:47.380> are

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
my preference i think that these are

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.160 
my preference i think that these are
just<00:02:48.370> never<00:02:49.030> seen<00:02:49.300> anything<00:02:49.600> like<00:02:49.630> it<00:02:49.750> before

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
just never seen anything like it before
