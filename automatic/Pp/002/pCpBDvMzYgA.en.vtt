anything at all yeah I mean like for a
lot<00:00:30.960> of<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.140> time<00:00:31.349> with<00:00:31.650> my<00:00:31.769> training<00:00:32.160> I<00:00:32.279> went

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
lot of the time with my training I went

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.610 
lot of the time with my training I went
to<00:00:32.880> you<00:00:33.719> know<00:00:33.809> I<00:00:33.840> learned<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.110> lot<00:00:34.260> of<00:00:34.410> legs

to you know I learned a lot of legs

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.190 
to you know I learned a lot of legs

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
basically because that way I could bring

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.690 
basically because that way I could bring
everything<00:00:37.410> down<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.680> little<00:00:37.890> bit<00:00:38.070> still

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
everything down a little bit still

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.340 
everything down a little bit still
training<00:00:38.969> really<00:00:39.180> intensely<00:00:39.600> so<00:00:39.840> that<00:00:40.050> you

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
training really intensely so that you

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.569 
training really intensely so that you
know<00:00:40.440> they<00:00:40.590> keep<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.829> muscle<00:00:41.129> there<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.520> keep

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
know they keep the muscle there and keep

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.610 
know they keep the muscle there and keep
the<00:00:41.670> fullness<00:00:41.879> but<00:00:42.540> just<00:00:43.050> come<00:00:43.170> in<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.320> little

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
the fullness but just come in a little

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.560 
the fullness but just come in a little
bit<00:00:43.800> more<00:00:43.890> complete<00:00:44.219> so<00:00:44.760> yeah<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.180> then<00:00:45.300> and

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
bit more complete so yeah and then and

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.760 
bit more complete so yeah and then and
then<00:00:45.660> now<00:00:45.809> it's<00:00:45.989> sort<00:00:46.140> of<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.320> know<00:00:46.350> gone<00:00:46.590> back

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
then now it's sort of you know gone back

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.170 
then now it's sort of you know gone back
to<00:00:46.950> just<00:00:47.190> squeezing<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.640> muscle<00:00:47.910> holding

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
to just squeezing the muscle holding

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.750 
to just squeezing the muscle holding
good<00:00:48.539> contractions<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.200> stuff<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.760> yeah

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
good contractions and stuff and yeah

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.220 
good contractions and stuff and yeah
hopefully<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.539> should<00:00:51.660> feel<00:00:51.809> everything<00:00:52.110> up

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
hopefully it should feel everything up

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.569 
hopefully it should feel everything up
nicely<00:00:52.469> so<00:00:52.800> they<00:00:52.890> come<00:00:53.010> in<00:00:53.100> nice<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.280> full

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
a big big dude exactly you know no I

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.710 
a big big dude exactly you know no I
think<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.610> was<00:01:26.700> about<00:01:26.790> ninety<00:01:27.060> four<00:01:27.210> kilos<00:01:27.570> at

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
think I was about ninety four kilos at

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.420 
think I was about ninety four kilos at
Auckland<00:01:27.960> chance<00:01:28.140> last<00:01:28.320> year<00:01:28.560> so<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:29.340> know

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
Auckland chance last year so you know

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.890 
Auckland chance last year so you know
and<00:01:29.610> then<00:01:29.700> i<00:01:29.759> went<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:29.970> arnold<00:01:30.329> i<00:01:30.390> was<00:01:30.479> 93

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
and then i went to the arnold i was 93

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.090 
and then i went to the arnold i was 93
but<00:01:31.079> Lena<00:01:31.320> so<00:01:31.590> probably<00:01:31.829> around<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.040> same

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
but Lena so probably around the same

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.969 
but Lena so probably around the same
size<00:01:33.200> now<00:01:34.200> i'm<00:01:34.350> sitting<00:01:34.470> at<00:01:34.650> about<00:01:34.740> eighty

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
size now i'm sitting at about eighty

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.060 
size now i'm sitting at about eighty
eight<00:01:35.189> so<00:01:36.200> basically<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.740> know<00:01:37.829> if<00:01:37.950> i<00:01:38.009> can

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
eight so basically you know if i can

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.499 
eight so basically you know if i can
just<00:01:38.189> take<00:01:38.430> it<00:01:38.549> back<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.670> little<00:01:38.790> bit<00:01:39.060> just<00:01:39.420> work

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
just take it back a little bit just work

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.600 
just take it back a little bit just work
on<00:01:39.630> that<00:01:39.750> symmetry<00:01:40.020> proportion<00:01:40.770> i<00:01:40.979> think

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
on that symmetry proportion i think

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.219 
on that symmetry proportion i think
that's<00:01:41.790> what<00:01:42.030> it's<00:01:42.450> going<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.600> make<00:01:42.960> me<00:01:43.020> look

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
that's what it's going to make me look

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.660 
that's what it's going to make me look
my<00:01:43.380> best<00:01:43.500> anyway<00:01:43.890> yeah<00:01:44.189> what<00:01:44.520> do<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:44.610> think

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
my best anyway yeah what do you think

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.399 
my best anyway yeah what do you think
strengths<00:01:45.149> i<00:01:45.210> know<00:01:45.299> you<00:01:45.390> got<00:01:45.509> sighs<00:01:45.780> that's

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
strengths i know you got sighs that's

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.480 
strengths i know you got sighs that's
that's<00:01:46.619> one<00:01:46.799> of<00:01:46.890> them<00:01:46.950> do<00:01:47.070> you<00:01:47.130> have<00:01:47.220> any<00:01:47.340> other

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
that's one of them do you have any other

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.010 
that's one of them do you have any other
strengths<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:47.970> your<00:01:48.000> mind<00:01:48.390> going<00:01:48.720> into<00:01:48.930> the

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
strengths and your mind going into the

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.889 
strengths and your mind going into the
Nationals<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.560> think<00:01:49.950> for<00:01:50.790> me<00:01:50.909> proportion<00:01:51.780> is

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
Nationals I think for me proportion is

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.120 
Nationals I think for me proportion is
my<00:01:52.049> biggest<00:01:52.229> thing<00:01:52.439> you<00:01:52.530> know<00:01:52.649> there's

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
my biggest thing you know there's

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.200 
my biggest thing you know there's
something<00:01:53.340> I've<00:01:53.399> worked<00:01:53.579> really<00:01:53.850> really<00:01:54.000> hard

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
something I've worked really really hard

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.429 
something I've worked really really hard
on<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.659> know<00:01:54.750> taking<00:01:54.960> measurements<00:01:55.259> and

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
on you know taking measurements and

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.080 
on you know taking measurements and
stuff<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.680> I<00:01:55.740> go<00:01:55.860> back<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.579> ideas<00:01:56.850> of<00:01:56.909> like

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
stuff and I go back to the ideas of like

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.819 
stuff and I go back to the ideas of like
Steve<00:01:57.329> Reeves<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:57.990> those<00:01:58.259> guys<00:01:58.439> back<00:01:58.680> in

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
Steve Reeves and and those guys back in

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.260 
Steve Reeves and and those guys back in
the<00:01:58.979> old<00:01:59.100> days<00:01:59.159> that<00:01:59.490> that<00:01:59.820> was<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.090> biggest

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
the old days that that was the biggest

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.330 
the old days that that was the biggest
concern<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:01.110> know<00:02:01.229> little<00:02:02.100> things<00:02:02.130> like

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
concern you know little things like

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.889 
concern you know little things like
bring<00:02:02.640> my<00:02:02.759> cards<00:02:03.210> are<00:02:03.329> they<00:02:03.420> now<00:02:03.540> match<00:02:03.750> my

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
bring my cards are they now match my

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.859 
bring my cards are they now match my
arms<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.409> my<00:02:04.950> neck<00:02:05.430> you<00:02:05.790> know<00:02:05.939> so<00:02:06.270> getting<00:02:06.780> a

arms and my neck you know so getting a

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.150 
arms and my neck you know so getting a
little<00:02:06.990> things<00:02:07.229> like<00:02:07.320> that<00:02:07.380> right<00:02:07.710> I<00:02:07.770> think

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
the carb up you know I came and really

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.470 
the carb up you know I came and really
bloated<00:02:47.769> I<00:02:48.099> got<00:02:48.549> it<00:02:48.640> wrong<00:02:48.790> and<00:02:49.180> there's<00:02:49.390> no
