00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.759
 save everything and we will reach it to do it 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:09.750
 art of a disappointed menu 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:17.340
 then the things we need are one 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:23.430
 white enamel a red enamel one 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:30.510
 light blue glaze a brown glaze 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:34.530
 dark and black chocolate mat therefore without 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.180
 glitter and nothing like tools will serve 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.750
 a sheet of paper a basin where 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:46.320
 mix the enamels a small brush a 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:47.969
 another subtle tip with divine whole 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.350
 thin because I have to use the two colors 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.910
 different and a spot or daughter like the 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.940
 first step I am going to lie on 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:01.250
 light blue on the ring finger and thumb 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.840
 where we're going to do the decoration 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.339
 main I'm going to get 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.520
 subsequently a brown 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:12.810
 I use this from the essence 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:16.290
 same line as the celestino and I go to 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.400
 color the middle of the nail I make a 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:26.430
 a brown part in the center of the nail 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:28.619
 this way those this part 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:33.869
 brown nail leaving then 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:35.670
 the space below and above once the 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.210
 browns will have slightly dried out 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:43.579
 I'm going to get the white nail polish and go 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.579
 to make the cap of the jar above 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.110
 now I take the same white as before and 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.780
 I'm going to make a strip instead to the 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.780
 naturally smaller center 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.890
 in this way then we will go 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.290
 subsequently writing note for 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.120
 to do it I advise you to put the 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.550
 brush at one end of the nail e 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:13.850
 turning this way was a line 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.850
 straight and still quite covering 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.340
 now I'm going to get the black and go to 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:23.439
 place on a sheet of paper in one 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:28.930
 bowl reuse this of the 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:33.670
 sloppy that is the matt black and with a 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:35.409
 thin tip brush I take the 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:45.640
 black and I outline my own 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:48.420
 jar then outline the cap in 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.420
 this way 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.080
 and then I go around the jar 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.390
 so and then the part below 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.230
 when the nail is totally dry 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.960
 almost 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:30.090
 let's write natella on the band 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:33.570
 white we'll need a small brush 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.820
 thin took put on the sheet of the 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:38.520
 black and red 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:42.140
 let's start by taking red and go to 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:45.120
 do calligraphy naturally 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:48.410
 whatever you want there is no need 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.410
 that is the same as mine 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:43.770
 now do not take long that will be 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:47.840
 the remaining nails of the hand we go 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.840
 to make a pass of white enamel 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:56.670
 now always on a sheet I go to put 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:05:00.050
 both the white enamel and put one 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:00.050
 abundant quantity 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:17.930
 in this way the swan also admit 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:23.570
 brown enamel too 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:30.130
 quite abundant now I take a 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:30.130
 dotter or spot with larger tip 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:40.970
 this water I take the two colors together 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:43.510
 and I'm going to mix them on the nail in 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.510
 this way 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:49.670
 this effect can also be done with the 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:52.990
 water marble volendola so you can 

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:52.990
 doing it went different ways 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:59.350
 don't worry if it's not perfect 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.350
 because the intent is just that 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:35.610
 so these are my two in all art 

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:38.690
 finish that of the nutella jar e 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:38.690
 that of nutella 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.479
 so I hope I have satisfied 

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:45.360
 request of my friends to upload 

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:49.050
 finally the tutorial and let's see 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:52.669
 how my nails were made or not 

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:52.669
 I hope you enjoyed a big kiss
