00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.399 

so<00:03:37.709> no<00:03:38.489> ticks<00:03:38.760> off<00:03:38.970> we<00:03:39.900> can<00:03:40.049> leave<00:03:40.230> that<00:03:40.260> on

00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:40.409

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
take it off I mean there's obviously a

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.390 
take it off I mean there's obviously a
big<00:03:48.000> difference<00:03:48.360> here<00:03:49.290> between<00:03:49.470> the<00:03:49.860> two<00:03:49.890> I

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
big difference here between the two I

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.550 
big difference here between the two I
mean<00:03:50.879> we<00:03:51.000> have<00:03:51.180> one<00:03:51.450> that's<00:03:51.720> it's<00:03:52.440> really

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
mean we have one that's it's really

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.490 
mean we have one that's it's really
basically<00:03:53.190> a<00:03:53.340> spray<00:03:53.760> paint<00:03:54.090> is<00:03:54.329> what<00:03:55.230> it<00:03:55.319> looks

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
basically a spray paint is what it looks

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 
it actually says shake hamburgers then

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:15.650

for<00:04:14.220> two<00:04:14.370> minutes<00:04:14.700> hold<00:04:14.910> can<00:04:15.150> eight<00:04:15.359> to<00:04:15.480> ten

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
for two minutes hold can eight to ten

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.599 
for two minutes hold can eight to ten
inches<00:04:16.079> from<00:04:16.440> service<00:04:16.769> apply<00:04:16.979> light<00:04:17.280> coats

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
inches from service apply light coats

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.279 
inches from service apply light coats
waiting<00:04:18.030> five<00:04:18.299> to<00:04:18.510> ten<00:04:18.690> minutes<00:04:19.019> in<00:04:19.139> between

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.289 
waiting five to ten minutes in between

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:22.730 
waiting five to ten minutes in between
coats<00:04:20.209> apply<00:04:21.209> until<00:04:21.570> complete<00:04:21.900> coverage<00:04:22.470> is

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
coats apply until complete coverage is

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.770 
coats apply until complete coverage is
achieved<00:04:23.370> which<00:04:23.669> is<00:04:23.820> usually<00:04:24.180> two<00:04:24.389> to<00:04:24.419> four

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
achieved which is usually two to four

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.890 
achieved which is usually two to four
coats<00:04:25.039> so<00:04:26.039> we<00:04:26.729> can<00:04:26.880> put<00:04:27.030> a<00:04:27.060> few<00:04:27.240> more<00:04:27.300> coats<00:04:27.630> on

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
coats so we can put a few more coats on

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.330 
coats so we can put a few more coats on
here<00:04:28.169> in<00:04:28.260> a<00:04:28.320> few<00:04:28.470> minutes<00:04:28.830> and<00:04:28.979> that's<00:04:29.130> going

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
here in a few minutes and that's going

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.980 
here in a few minutes and that's going
to<00:04:29.400> look<00:04:29.610> it's<00:04:30.300> going<00:04:30.449> to<00:04:30.510> look<00:04:30.600> really<00:04:30.960> really

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
to look it's going to look really really

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.719 
to look it's going to look really really
good<00:04:31.470> compared<00:04:32.310> to<00:04:32.460> compared<00:04:33.300> to<00:04:33.360> that<00:04:34.190> so<00:04:35.190> I<00:04:35.220> I

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:35.729 
good compared to compared to that so I I

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:38.420 
good compared to compared to that so I I
don't<00:04:36.150> even<00:04:36.240> think<00:04:36.570> we<00:04:36.690> have<00:04:36.870> to<00:04:37.080> wait<00:04:37.430> the

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
don't even think we have to wait the

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.150 
don't even think we have to wait the
wipe<00:04:38.639> knew<00:04:38.940> just<00:04:39.419> didn't<00:04:39.770> didn't<00:04:40.770> really

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
wipe knew just didn't didn't really

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.400 
wipe knew just didn't didn't really
restore<00:04:41.639> this<00:04:41.849> plastic<00:04:42.389> at<00:04:42.539> all<00:04:42.750> we've<00:04:43.080> used

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
restore this plastic at all we've used

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.409 
restore this plastic at all we've used
this<00:04:43.590> multiple<00:04:44.160> times<00:04:44.220> on<00:04:44.669> other<00:04:44.820> vehicles

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
this multiple times on other vehicles

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:47.930 
this multiple times on other vehicles
and<00:04:45.690> it<00:04:46.260> worked<00:04:46.440> great<00:04:46.620> but<00:04:46.950> I<00:04:47.070> think<00:04:47.460> in<00:04:47.639> this

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
and it worked great but I think in this

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:53.570 
and it worked great but I think in this
case<00:04:48.240> the<00:04:49.200> wipe<00:04:49.440> knew<00:04:49.740> just<00:04:50.599> didn't<00:04:51.599> do<00:04:51.690> it<00:04:52.580> so

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
case the wipe knew just didn't do it so

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.820 
case the wipe knew just didn't do it so
if<00:04:54.300> you<00:04:54.539> really<00:04:54.750> want<00:04:55.080> to<00:04:55.169> look<00:04:55.320> for<00:04:55.590> something

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
if you really want to look for something

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.010 
if you really want to look for something
that's<00:04:56.010> that's<00:04:56.820> going<00:04:57.000> to<00:04:57.060> restore<00:04:57.270> some<00:04:57.780> dark

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
that's that's going to restore some dark

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.620 
that's that's going to restore some dark
plastic<00:04:58.620> that's<00:04:59.099> black<00:04:59.520> this<00:04:59.970> is<00:05:00.030> for<00:05:00.389> black

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
plastic that's black this is for black

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.170 
plastic that's black this is for black
obviously<00:05:01.460> looks<00:05:02.460> like<00:05:02.520> the<00:05:02.729> Eastwood

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
obviously looks like the Eastwood

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.390 
obviously looks like the Eastwood
company<00:05:03.210> plastic<00:05:04.050> resurfacer<00:05:04.620> is<00:05:04.680> probably

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
company plastic resurfacer is probably

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.700 
company plastic resurfacer is probably
going<00:05:05.580> to<00:05:05.669> be<00:05:05.789> a<00:05:05.820> better<00:05:06.090> deal<00:05:06.360> for<00:05:06.630> you<00:05:06.710> takes
