00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:08.510
 in 1993 there was only one ticket for the 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:10.430
 World Cup in 1994 we made the tie 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.619
 that was very very good and very demanded 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:15.080
 because it was a single fixed ticket gave to 

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:16.880
 concacaf only two places and one already 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.789
 belonged to the hobby 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.039
 us the panorama turned black mexico 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:24.580
 received a harsh in the Aztec and see what 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:24.580
 what happens 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.120
 Well, they give me a trip that does not 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.880
 It's useless and methods to kick and come 

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:36.840
 the red card where I really put in 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.920
 doubt all the whole work that 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.270
 has made the team after 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.340
 twenty-something years miguel 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.980
 try to make us forget his attitude 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.809
 do not 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:50.440
 but that marked him so that I never 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:53.850
 I thought more about Mexico, I knew how to get out of 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:57.220
 pothole of those that come out intuitively 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.489
 contrary included and it was for that ball 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.780
 it's not that it came too short and then it 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.230
 it happened to me at that time we have a 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.370
 Dove and try 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.370
 the goal that came out 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.400
 later hugo sanchez has this 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.590
 opportunity and the advantage 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.260
 if that were not enough but with the selection 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.910
 it's something awesome and a tribe I 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:24.130
 I had better fortune what came out as 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.130
 crazy to celebrate the banking 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.990
 It has its reward how you feel in 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.370
 that moment when you are in the stadium 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.800
 I am 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:36.240
 and joel growing 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:38.880
 at the moment of the blow I feel 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.030
 the biggest of all because you see a 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.220
 great saturation to the 120 thousand people who 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.110
 a whole country is in this life and that the 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.570
 people who greet me is that you did 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.759
 the game is not that I had this or 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.920
 it's like people did not identify 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.869
 much in that aspect that we 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.149
 we talked where we were, I knew that 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.060
 We were going to break up and that the people with whom 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.130
 she felt she is not proud she is 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.720
 to say this is my selection is today this 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.789
 history now we have to take the caste 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.789
