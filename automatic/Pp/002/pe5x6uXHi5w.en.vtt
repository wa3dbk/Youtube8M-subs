00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:40.970 
performance and like I say when you keep

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.220 
performance and like I say when you keep
clean<00:00:41.240> sheets<00:00:41.270> against<00:00:41.810> quality<00:00:42.079> opposition

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
clean sheets against quality opposition

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.860 
clean sheets against quality opposition
then<00:00:42.680> it<00:00:43.160> gives<00:00:43.280> you<00:00:43.430> a<00:00:43.460> good<00:00:43.579> boost<00:00:43.790> and<00:00:44.090> of

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
then it gives you a good boost and of

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.060 
then it gives you a good boost and of
course<00:00:44.900> the<00:00:45.200> opposition<00:00:45.650> when<00:00:45.829> they<00:00:45.920> can

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
course the opposition when they can

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.290 
course the opposition when they can
bring<00:00:46.190> the<00:00:46.310> lots<00:00:46.460> of<00:00:46.640> Cameron<00:00:46.940> Jerome<00:00:47.030> and

because<00:01:13.490> that<00:01:13.819> the<00:01:13.939> pitch<00:01:14.090> I<00:01:14.240> think<00:01:14.329> took<00:01:14.569> a

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
because that the pitch I think took a

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:16.209 
because that the pitch I think took a
lot<00:01:14.780> out<00:01:14.869> of<00:01:14.929> everyone<00:01:15.380> that<00:01:15.590> was<00:01:15.740> a<00:01:15.770> very

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
heavy pitch and very bubbly pitch so you

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.679
