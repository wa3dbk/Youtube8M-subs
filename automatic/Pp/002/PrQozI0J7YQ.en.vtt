00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.890
 hi guys here we are again from 

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:10.490
 again this other video more for youtube 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:15.010
 for all my people I'm going to 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:19.740
 teach how to grab a rabbit with a 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.740
 a house a house-type trap 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.470
 and as we can see here we find a 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.099
 hole 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.099
 we wait 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.629
 and as you can see here we have a hole and 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:53.350
 It seems that something is very big 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:58.170
 because if it really is very big then 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.170
 here we are going to put your trap 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.190
 Well, we were still here, we already have 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:10.040
 our wire 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.870
 It's a guy, it 's a very hot band 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.250
 thin thin 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:18.940
 here the first thing we have to do 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.940
 this is a small a little house a nudito 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.540
 why 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.020
 our house wants to see us 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.310
 As you can see here we have a signal 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:43.130
 we grab the tip and jump 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.250
 we're 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.060
 and we leave 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.060
 a little 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.810
 and what 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:02.750
 well you already here we have our house 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.750
 what we do is place it 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.990
 we tie here a branch that is 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.800
 near there 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.800
 we are making progress 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.549
 so that our strawberry 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.549
 then I can go 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.070
 let's say he 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.070
 circle 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:52.160
 let's say day 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.160
 we are perfect 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.540
 why 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.250
 people 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.250
 normal 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.960
 that complicates us a little bit 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.650
 you look for the good 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.650
 the knot 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.590
 it's perfect 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:55.880
 And there we have it 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.880
 as you can see up close 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:02.330
 I have scales ugt 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:05.270
 you can see 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:09.970
 and there it is 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.970
 It is our circle 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.020
 let's go back to that is all for today and I hope 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.980
