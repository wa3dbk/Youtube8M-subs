00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.870
 I want to share with you a statistic 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.040
 alarming 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:14.179
 I do not know if you do not know but 80% of 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:16.490
 people who live in the US do not 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:18.770

 succeed doing something they do not like 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:27.739
 it's going to be very difficult and why because 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:30.980
 to succeed economically to have 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:33.469

 money where you will respect where you 

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:46.100
 they will recognize by your talents almost 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:47.719
 it is almost impossible to achieve it if not 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.030
 you are doing what you like 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:52.370
 do first to get rich and 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.190
 to succeed big you have to 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.949
 devote more than eight hours and if you have 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:01.159
 a job you do not like after 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:04.610
 the eight hours tips your card and as 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:07.250
 speedy gonzÃ¡lez you go to your house because 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.240
 you do not like your job but if it's a 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.820
 work that you like then 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.720
 you do not know what the difference is between 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.340
 Monday on Friday on Saturday and Sunday 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.860
 most of us are 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.289
 happy on weekends because no 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.899
 we have to work but the person who 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:29.020
 he likes his work is dedicated to his 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:31.170
 also on weekends 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.909
 first if you are going to succeed 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.539
 you need to spend more than eight hours per 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:41.200
 day if you are going to have great success and if the 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:43.390
 work you do not like then you devote 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.610
 only the time that is necessary 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.830
 then if you are going to succeed big 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:51.190
 you have to be doing what you have 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:53.009
 Like I remember that years ago I was 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.350
 watching television and my teacher 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:59.229
 online gay came out on TV and I 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.200
 asked I would like to be a millionaire and 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.569
 I thought between - as there is no who does not and 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.939
 then he said rob what would you do if you were 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:09.789
 millionaire what would you do with your time if 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:12.459
 you did not have to work and I remember that 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:15.310
 I thought between my equal I would go back to 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:17.350
 radio, I loved working in the 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.230
 radio came in the morning when I was 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.600
 dark and came back in the night when 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:26.200
 It was dark, the hours were telling me 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:29.380
 minutes because I loved working in 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.140
 the radio and said I would go back to the 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:36.549
 radio if I could if I did not have to 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:39.010
 make money and he told me good that you 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:40.840
 you thought you would do if you did not have to 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.190
 work this you have to do 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.810
 because that's what you like to do 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.359
 you have to do what you like to do 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.489
 if you are going to succeed so you can 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:54.700
 devote the necessary time to 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:58.239
 succeed and also in which head fits 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:01.600
 that you're going to spend a third of 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:04.329
 your life imagine a third of 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:08.859
 your life doing something you do not like or 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:11.049
 it is not logical it is not logical to pass a 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:13.690
 third part of your life doing what 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:16.810
 you do not like it and with the hopes of 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.300
 succeed maybe years ago that you have not 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.360
 dreamed of 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.100
 you have not thought with what you want what 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.950
 I would really like to do 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.380
 I want you to pause this day and think 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.450
 it's more all day until the 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.480
 ask what it is that I really do 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:36.870
 would like to do now as I would like 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:39.630
 spend my days that is the dream 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.580
 what is the fantasy that I have in 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.910
 question of what I would like 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:47.280
 do and do it I remember after 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.050
 listen to me to tell me that I 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.900
 I should dedicate myself to what I 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.340
 it took like two months and each 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.740
 I had the voice of the Lord 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.600
 nightingale here in my head telling me 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:00.510
 you have to be doing what you have 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:04.110
 like if you have plans to succeed and 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:06.210
 I remember that I left my job and 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:09.300
 I dedicated to the radio 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:10.830
 and here I am thank you I did that 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.150
 decision 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:17.370
 then if you should think you succeed 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:20.190
 I want you to start thinking that I 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:23.910
 I would like to be what I like 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:27.240
 do what I like to do and 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:29.700
 do not be afraid to do what you 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.010
 like to do because the only way that 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.100
 you will succeed and do not want to waste 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:37.020
 your life doing things you do not like 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:39.630
 and then maybe you ask him but what if 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:43.260
 I do not win that if I do not make all the money 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:45.810
 I want to do good, imagine maybe 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:50.190
 do not succeed economically like you 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:53.010
 you wanted but you spent your whole life without 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.990
 have to work because one works 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.510
 only when you're doing something 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.910
 that you do not really like that's work 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:03.210
 air or work I have to go to the 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:06.000
 work because you do not like it and because 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:09.000
 that saw more work and that's why it does not give you 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.720
 You want to go because you do not like it but if 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:17.070
 you like then you're going to spend your life 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:21.570
 without working doing every day what 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:24.990
 what do you like to do then start 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:30.200
 again to dream about what it is that is what 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:35.230
 you really would like to do and do it 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:35.230
 I 'm brown see you next time
