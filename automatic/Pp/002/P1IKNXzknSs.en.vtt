00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:10.200
 heidi your world are the mountains 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.480
 you are already there I was just still 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.030
 few thoughts I'm so sorry so we 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.890
 I've seen it today in the heidi and 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.680
 how should I sing along with melody ? 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.539
 as a child, it probably has that too 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.510
 or other times because because 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.820
 sense org in truth is about that 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.970
 a little girl yes in the alps 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.730
 moves to a mountain hut to a 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.760
 so-called everything praises me as far as that 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.910
 have also taken wikipedia his name 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.559
 never even all furniture why that's what 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.559
 not then we have then 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:47.219
 as two main characters besides heidi 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.590
 This older man Peter the last 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.860
 heidi you then love the everyday 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.420
 Run the mountains and I believe from the 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.550
 the second half he comes in the 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.219
 City to a girl in wheelchair 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.070
 because she can not walk so well 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.019
 but the corrida always after the time 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.610
 again more because the heidi with her 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.619
 plays or something like that I am 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.010
 sometimes for sure I 've been forever 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.020
 In any case, that's probably how it should be 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.850
 So I get there so just always 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:21.450
 a bit blatant that the japanese 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:24.030
 a series about the alps so over 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.369
 Germany Austria or Switzerland 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.490
 I guess that's really in it 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.390
 settled in Austria or in 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.900
 I was him in southern Germany 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.939
 really on austria you and me 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.460
 knew it does not even know that 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.009
 even anime is and above all sani 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.590
 meter is already older that knew 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.079
 Me neither, and what I am first 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.329
 later learned that dear sir 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.600
 more sacchi since already cooperated 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:54.540
 has that one or the other 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.540
 people of julie were there 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.980
 already active participation you what you can 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.770
 say big to the characters 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:05.620
 It's a children's series and you can 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.530
 clearly see that the series are typical 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.480
 is for example this old man of 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.670
 only on the mountains or heidi that became 

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:17.350
 Girls that hide nothing at all 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:20.320
 knows and volvic and other is or 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.480
 Peter who always has nice seals on how 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.520
 said what i thought was cool 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.070
 I always liked to sing music 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.770
 and as far as I know, that too 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:32.200
 other music this immediately comes true 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.840
 actually quite nice I think that is 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.140
 really kids series and it can 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:42.280
 You're also good at seeing it 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:44.230
 Here on the books of authors I 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.370
 my r Swiss author but I am 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.880
 I'm not sure if I will 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.740
 that happens on a book and 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.820
 as far as I'm informed insists that yes 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:57.010
 also over 52 follow i hope that 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.560
 but I always had that over 50 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.140
 has followed like that did that 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.560
 I ask myself until today and what they give me 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.990
 even more asks how it is about him mountains 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.100
 into German television creates and 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.290
 if you look at it from today's point of view 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.520
 i consider most of my animes 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.200
 will not even be in Germany anymore 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.600
 I am quite happy to license 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.060
 seriously at the time it must be anime 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.700
 really hardly existed in Germany why 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.830
 you 're already licensed heidi me 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.140
 do not understand that now, somehow 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.870
 been bad I would not be found 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.420
 Cool is really definite 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.430
 quite different than that one is there 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.950
 Otherwise, then come see 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.560
 now to my conclusion he heidi s stop 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:42.100
 really a children's series had the 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:45.040
 another series typical characters 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:47.650
 but has built up very nice 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.380
 beautiful features has a beautiful 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:53.260
 music setting is actually 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.690
 also quite pleasant and I think of 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.660
 the atmosphere comes from there really 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:01.150
 relatively good in this mountainous all 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.730
 landscapes in, I'm right 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.239
 not the biggest fan of the series as 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.599
 I think that's really from 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.670
 1900 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:13.700
 74 is so far as I know that 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:16.340
 pretty much one of the great pioneers 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:19.190
 there are some and you also have some 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.410
 known people worked on it 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.000
 it's nice to watch 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.949
 I just have to say today 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.139
 that no longer means i would do it 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:28.850
 not really looking at me anymore 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:31.490
 if then maybe only now and then 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.500
 a two follow, of course, too 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.940
 it's hard again that jan should i 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.220
 I am not informed on dvd 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:40.039
 gives the most in German yes 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.610
 animes formerly ran sala on it 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:45.080
 German prayer 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.639
 monster rangers or sailor moon one 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.580
 long time but that is yes then now 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:52.760
 thanks soon for gas thanks for example 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:55.180
 there is no doro or politics either 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:58.310
 All in all, I want the anime 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:01.460
 despite being so old and still 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:04.669
 that it is just my kids series or 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:07.220
 exactly because of the actually 70 out of 100 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:10.160
 give points even if that is the case 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:13.310
 typical characters are here for this 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:16.280
 time was the I think was 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.750
 really something new and I mean otherwise 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.160
 I'll barely believe it 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.599
 Germany did not get something 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.639
 It is a pity that it is the 

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:25.160
 these days no longer on these 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:27.200
 are child television had he 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.030
 always quite liked to kika I looked 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.490
 do not even know if Tiger meanwhile 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:33.500
 does not even give me that of 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:36.020
 I mean that's for sure 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.449
 But I will give it here 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:40.880
 barely walk if it could me 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:42.620
 like to teach it better and as always 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.720
 of course everything is said here he is 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.160
 100 in my opinion if I do not 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.870
 has made it quite easy 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.830
 own see you in the next video 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.830
 first the blues
