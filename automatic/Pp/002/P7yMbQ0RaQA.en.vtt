00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:06.660
 Hi, this is Sergey Samsonov and and photo ap 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:10.700
 expo point ru and this is not a test kml 750 to 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.700
 this is only the announcement of this test 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.769
 since testing coming 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.529
 In the past two years, the company has made 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:32.719
 pretty significant steps forward in 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.940
 particulars are fully updated here 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:37.399
 matrix, that is, if earlier it was possible 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.340
 say that's just 18 megapixel 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:42.199
 matrix means she is the same 18 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.350
 megapixel matrix means change 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:47.269
 any year from year to year 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.519
 argued that it was wrong because it 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:51.800
 really was not so distinguish 18 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:53.989
 megapixel matrix with phase 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.300
 sensors on it from the one on which these 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:57.260
 phase sensors no very easy 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.210
 poke into the screen 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.160
 see how the camera focuses and in 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.260
 Generally look at least like a camera 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.810
 takes off now I think that such 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.759
 no questions at all 24 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.130
 megapixels is just that plank up 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:13.399
 which the camera has reached now is not 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.860
 just because of the growth of megapixel 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:17.990
 Nasty competitors and I must say 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.850
 did it for a reason first 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.530
 a normal user is sufficiently much 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.899
 less honest i can't see 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.479
 need to put 24 megapixel 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:29.240
 matrices here in this type of camera 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:32.149
 but, all the same, the company delivered a new 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.240
 6 digic processor on this matrix itself 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:37.100
 in order for the camera to produce 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.500
 exactly the same pictures as all 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.509
 the rest none the less as for 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.149
 frequency picture quality 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.189
 she stayed at cannes level and to 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.619
 Sorry for what did not appear in this 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:49.460
 camera is what 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:50.930
 the low-pass filter remained 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.939
 in front of the matrix despite the fact that 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.860
 the resolution has grown beyond the threshold 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:56.119
 the value after which the majority 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.369
 manufacturers these 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.469
 low- pass filter and pushed back just 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.840
 in order for this detail to grow 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:04.939
 but I must say that this is not done here. 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.100
 just because this threshold 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:10.369
 the value is controversial and in such a cell 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.320
 amateur level need to say this 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.600
 no such need no because 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.519
 lovers very rarely take off some 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.209
 wild macro in order for them to have 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:21.980
 straight pixel detailing and therefore 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.210
 you can probably not take them into account 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.850
 less 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:28.250
 the camera turned out worthy of that personally 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.500
 I don't like the fact that she is good 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.410
 copes from the photo from the video because 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.060
 on the screen it focuses just as well 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.940
 as a predecessor and maybe even 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.280
 faster still personally I liked here 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.140
 viewfinder but more I suggest 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.000
 a little bit to dig into this camera in this 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.560
 announcing how much 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.750
 refined her example has become less 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.330
 plastic body fully 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.410
 rubberized it became easier although 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.020
 in this she is pretty 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.930
 surely lies in her hand that is her hold 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:59.000
 stayed good in general here 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.760
 really there are some changes now 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.580
 it is equipped with an objective stepper 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.230
 motor 850 5 stm which regret 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.180
 stabilizers stabilizers naturally 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.470
 made for video operators or 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.080
 at least those people who are not 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.920
 videotaping for their personal 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.140
 needs 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.850
 interface on the back almost 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.760
 absolutely the same buttons haven't changed 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:22.280
 menu buttons flip screen flip 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.890
 touch screen and very comfortable which 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:28.300
 you can literally poke if you click 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.540
 press key and make changes 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:33.400
 absolute 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:35.960
 in all modes if you need it 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.660
 the same way you can make the text 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:41.570
 correction within those that you 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.880
 necessary aperture true aperture 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:46.670
 much easier to twist a finger but 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.530
 at least so it can also be 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.390
 change buttons remained traditional 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.280
 rubberizing in the same places 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.320
 there are some changes on the top 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.170
 panels are literally a couple of extra keys and but 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.940
 it is not so much though more 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.440
 convenient part of this function is actually 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.170
 could be transferred to the touch screen 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.890
 which in general is ordinary 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.920
 krutilki 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:10.220
 main mode dial without varnish and 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.750
 another network indicator was added wi-fi 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.160
 because the camera is pretty easy 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.350
 controlled via Wi-Fi 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.780
 up to the text is engaged in video naturally 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:20.450
 here is an external microphone which 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.530
 can connect to the world and 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.200
 remote connector 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.690
 management and of course there is 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:29.360
 mini hdmi and standard microusb connector 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.340
 As for the vision that I'll cover it if 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.800
 let's say you turn on tracking autofocus 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.260
 then the camera you will follow 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:39.380
 the square that you designate 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:41.420
 right on the screen behind the object changes 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.190
 focus distance and so on it 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:45.890
 very convenient and effective to help the 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:49.430
 shooting autofocus in this mode is very 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:52.010
 fast it really works and 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.580
 It works in the video mode quite 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.100
 passable 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.510
 the cameras itself fits well in the hand and 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.100
 plastic itself which received mass 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:00.560
 negative comments also in general 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.330
 here changed days and rough and now 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.910
 much more pleasant to the touch 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.500
 I remind you that this is an announcement 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.360
 interactive test during which 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.670
 you can ask us questions in order 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.800
 so I have these questions later 

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:15.140
 I will answer I answer naturally next 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:18.200
 video full video dough in which 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:20.660
 we will consider all the features of this 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:23.060
 cameras and I hope that they will 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:26.300
 adequate so i'm waiting for your questions 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:28.340
 right below this video or on pages 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.410
 of our site under this very test 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.480
 link to the test, see below 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:33.770
 Well, of course, come to our site 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:36.350
 watch video tests 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:39.110
 comment right here or somewhere else 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:41.960
 in general, we are always happy critics always 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:44.000
 glad to those words you tell us 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.460
 say we listen to you and 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.590
 First of all, we remember that naturally 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:50.480
 test we do for you especially for 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:53.900
 you was Sergey Samsonov photo roubaix 

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:56.350
 p.ru I hope to see you soon 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.350
 of time
