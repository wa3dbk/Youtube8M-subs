00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.100 

right<00:03:13.450> now<00:03:14.349> this<00:03:15.099> this<00:03:15.700> next<00:03:16.000> section<00:03:16.180> is<00:03:17.049> very

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
right now this this next section is very

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.890 
right now this this next section is very
repetitive<00:03:17.620> it<00:03:18.489> just<00:03:18.640> goes<00:03:18.760> on<00:03:18.880> and<00:03:19.030> on<00:03:19.090> so<00:03:19.329> the

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
repetitive it just goes on and on so the

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.830 
repetitive it just goes on and on so the
best<00:03:20.049> way<00:03:20.200> I<00:03:20.260> think<00:03:20.349> of<00:03:20.680> this<00:03:20.829> I<00:03:21.480> mean<00:03:22.480> I<00:03:22.660> never

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
best way I think of this I mean I never

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.240 
best way I think of this I mean I never
really<00:03:23.140> thought<00:03:23.349> of<00:03:23.530> it<00:03:23.650> and<00:03:23.769> so<00:03:24.010> that's

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
really thought of it and so that's

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.800 
really thought of it and so that's
always<00:03:24.489> started<00:03:24.790> doing<00:03:25.000> this<00:03:25.060> video<00:03:25.209> on<00:03:25.599> and

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
always started doing this video on and

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.509 
always started doing this video on and
we<00:03:28.810> have<00:03:28.989> these<00:03:29.200> bends<00:03:29.470> which<00:03:30.160> sound<00:03:30.459> like

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
we have these bends which sound like

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:33.590 
we have these bends which sound like
this<00:03:30.900> we<00:03:31.900> have<00:03:32.049> a<00:03:32.079> 17th<00:03:32.560> fret<00:03:32.799> on<00:03:32.950> high<00:03:33.160> and

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
this we have a 17th fret on high and

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.559 
this we have a 17th fret on high and
then<00:03:35.130> we<00:03:36.130> Bend<00:03:36.370> up<00:03:36.549> from<00:03:36.760> the<00:03:36.850> 20th<00:03:37.239> foot<00:03:37.450> on

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569 
then we Bend up from the 20th foot on

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:41.819 
then we Bend up from the 20th foot on
the<00:03:37.660> beat<00:03:37.870> a<00:03:38.109> full<00:03:38.410> tone<00:03:40.380> we<00:03:41.380> do<00:03:41.500> that<00:03:41.650> three

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
the beat a full tone we do that three

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:47.940 
the beat a full tone we do that three
times<00:03:45.030> and<00:03:46.030> that's<00:03:46.480> one<00:03:46.750> little<00:03:47.019> section<00:03:47.260> and

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
times and that's one little section and

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.620 
times and that's one little section and
then<00:03:48.130> we<00:03:48.280> repeat<00:03:48.579> that<00:03:48.639> six<00:03:49.090> times<00:03:49.299> ok<00:03:49.720> so<00:03:51.239> no<00:03:52.239> 6

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
then we repeat that six times ok so no 6

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.559 
then we repeat that six times ok so no 6
times<00:03:53.280> or<00:03:54.280> five<00:03:54.459> times<00:03:54.519> more<00:03:54.940> after<00:03:55.150> that<00:03:55.180> so

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
times or five times more after that so

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:10.270 
times or five times more after that so
oops

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:26.529 

so<00:04:11.280> six<00:04:11.880> of<00:04:12.060> those<00:04:14.600> after<00:04:15.600> the<00:04:15.630> vote<00:04:22.130> hi

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:26.539 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:29.390 

and<00:04:27.539> on<00:04:27.720> the<00:04:27.870> last<00:04:28.020> note<00:04:28.500> of<00:04:28.530> the<00:04:28.770> six<00:04:29.039> we<00:04:29.220> don't

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
and on the last note of the six we don't

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.330 
and on the last note of the six we don't
actually<00:04:29.580> bend<00:04:29.940> off<00:04:30.120> we<00:04:30.479> just<00:04:30.660> hit<00:04:30.870> the<00:04:31.340> 20th

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
actually bend off we just hit the 20th

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.540 
actually bend off we just hit the 20th
threat<00:04:32.580> and<00:04:33.360> then<00:04:34.229> we<00:04:34.530> Bend<00:04:34.740> up<00:04:34.949> I<00:04:35.069> believe<00:04:35.250> a

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
threat and then we Bend up I believe a

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:44.930 
threat and then we Bend up I believe a
fourth<00:04:35.849> fret<00:04:36.240> Bend<00:04:36.479> so<00:04:37.110> it's<00:04:38.449> so<00:04:39.449> it's<00:04:43.940> full

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
fourth fret Bend so it's so it's full

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:52.430 
fourth fret Bend so it's so it's full
effect<00:04:45.240> then<00:04:45.919> from<00:04:46.919> that<00:04:47.430> notes<00:04:49.550> so<00:04:50.550> what

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
effect then from that notes so what

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.390 
effect then from that notes so what
and<00:04:53.599> then<00:04:54.599> we<00:04:54.870> release<00:04:55.020> the<00:04:55.169> bend<00:04:55.530> and<00:04:55.860> just<00:04:56.159> do

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
and then we release the bend and just do

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.980 
and then we release the bend and just do
some<00:04:56.580> vibrato<00:04:56.699> on<00:04:57.210> the<00:04:57.300> 20th<00:04:57.690> fret<00:04:59.840> so<00:05:00.840> it's

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
some vibrato on the 20th fret so it's

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:06.740 
some vibrato on the 20th fret so it's
quite<00:05:01.169> heavy<00:05:01.819> and<00:05:03.289> yeah<00:05:04.970> so<00:05:05.970> I'll<00:05:06.479> do<00:05:06.630> that

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
quite heavy and yeah so I'll do that

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:15.730 
quite heavy and yeah so I'll do that
again

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:21.750 

five<00:05:17.599> six

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:21.760 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.210 

and<00:05:22.760> that's<00:05:23.180> that<00:05:23.780> that's<00:05:24.169> a<00:05:24.320> way<00:05:24.650> of<00:05:24.680> counting

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.220 
and that's that that's a way of counting

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.969 
and that's that that's a way of counting
it<00:05:25.400> which<00:05:25.610> I<00:05:26.260> think<00:05:27.260> that's<00:05:27.560> the<00:05:27.650> best<00:05:27.830> way<00:05:27.949> I

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:27.979 
it which I think that's the best way I

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:28.900 
it which I think that's the best way I
came<00:05:28.280> up

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
came up

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.320 
came up
that's<00:05:29.150> what<00:05:29.270> I've<00:05:29.360> come<00:05:29.479> up<00:05:29.630> with<00:05:29.660> to<00:05:30.139> kind<00:05:30.740> of

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
that's what I've come up with to kind of

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.950 
that's what I've come up with to kind of
communicate<00:05:32.330> that<00:05:33.430> so<00:05:34.430> I<00:05:34.729> think<00:05:35.449> we'll<00:05:35.750> keep

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
communicate that so I think we'll keep

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:41.530 
communicate that so I think we'll keep
that<00:05:36.320> part<00:05:37.190> there<00:05:37.490> for<00:05:38.060> this<00:05:38.150> lesson<00:05:40.330> but<00:05:41.330> I'll

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:41.540 
that part there for this lesson but I'll

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:44.070 
that part there for this lesson but I'll
put<00:05:41.750> the<00:05:41.870> next<00:05:42.199> video<00:05:42.470> up<00:05:42.590> immediately<00:05:42.830> after

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 
put the next video up immediately after

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.500 
put the next video up immediately after
so<00:05:45.080> stay<00:05:45.290> tuned
