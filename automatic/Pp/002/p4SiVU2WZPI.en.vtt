relationship with bougainvillea

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.509 
relationship with bougainvillea
I<00:00:24.660> think<00:00:24.930> because<00:00:25.170> you<00:00:25.289> see<00:00:25.650> them<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:25.859> lot<00:00:26.070> here

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
I think because you see them a lot here

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.089 
I think because you see them a lot here
in<00:00:26.960> Southern<00:00:27.960> California<00:00:28.080> also<00:00:28.710> they<00:00:28.980> have

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
in Southern California also they have

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.420 
in Southern California also they have
thorns<00:00:30.090> on<00:00:30.359> them<00:00:30.720> but<00:00:30.929> I<00:00:31.080> happen<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.740> like<00:00:32.130> them

thorns on them but I happen to like them
very<00:00:32.610> much<00:00:33.149> so<00:00:33.540> that's<00:00:33.660> why<00:00:33.930> I'm<00:00:34.140> going<00:00:34.320> to

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
starts to warm up again but this one is

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.480 
starts to warm up again but this one is
still<00:01:14.130> like<00:01:14.430> loaded<00:01:14.970> with<00:01:15.210> color<00:01:16.040> so<00:01:17.040> we<00:01:17.340> need

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
still like loaded with color so we need

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.149 
still like loaded with color so we need
Sun<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:17.970> besides<00:01:18.270> Sun<00:01:18.479> it<00:01:18.689> also<00:01:19.080> needs<00:01:19.979> a

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
Sun and besides Sun it also needs a

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.520 
Sun and besides Sun it also needs a
warmth<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:20.700> likes<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.540> have<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.990> warmth<00:01:22.320> to

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
warmth it likes to have the warmth to

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.700 
warmth it likes to have the warmth to
bloom<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.189> put<00:01:23.400> out<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:24.210> lot<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:24.600> this<00:01:25.439> color

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
bloom and to put out a lot of this color

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.429 
bloom and to put out a lot of this color
it's<00:01:26.280> found<00:01:26.580> in<00:01:26.820> many<00:01:27.090> different<00:01:27.509> forms<00:01:28.200> it

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
it's found in many different forms it

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.069 
it's found in many different forms it
can<00:01:28.710> be<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:28.890> vine<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.759> can<00:01:29.880> be<00:01:30.000> on<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.299> arbor<00:01:30.750> and

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
can be a vine it can be on the arbor and

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.719 
can be a vine it can be on the arbor and
actually<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:31.530> can<00:01:31.770> grow<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.189> you<00:01:32.430> can<00:01:32.549> train

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
actually you can grow it you can train

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.109 
actually you can grow it you can train
it<00:01:32.850> up<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.299> an<00:01:33.390> arbor<00:01:33.780> against<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.470> fence<00:01:35.119> the

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
it up to an arbor against a fence the

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.870 
it up to an arbor against a fence the
lower<00:01:36.390> ones<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:37.500> can<00:01:37.650> use<00:01:37.950> as<00:01:38.159> shrubs<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.640> can

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
lower ones you can use as shrubs you can

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.850 
lower ones you can use as shrubs you can
from<00:01:39.479> this<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.960> shrubs<00:01:40.290> although<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:40.619> don't

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
from this and shrubs although I don't

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.399 
from this and shrubs although I don't
think<00:01:41.070> it's<00:01:41.220> really<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.490> good<00:01:41.700> shrub<00:01:41.970> plant

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
think it's really a good shrub plant

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:44.480 
think it's really a good shrub plant
because<00:01:43.409> it<00:01:43.530> does<00:01:43.649> have<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.860> lot<00:01:44.040> of<00:01:44.070> pruning

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
because it does have a lot of pruning

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.240 
because it does have a lot of pruning
and<00:01:44.610> Bougainville<00:01:45.360> flowers<00:01:46.350> on<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:47.009> new

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
and Bougainville flowers on the new

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.940 
and Bougainville flowers on the new
growth<00:01:47.549> so<00:01:47.850> you're<00:01:48.390> constantly<00:01:48.960> cutting<00:01:49.740> off

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
growth so you're constantly cutting off

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.789 
growth so you're constantly cutting off
the<00:01:50.100> flowering<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:51.360> think<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:52.079> color<00:01:52.530> is

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
the flowering and I think the color is

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.480 
the flowering and I think the color is
the<00:01:53.009> main<00:01:53.220> draw<00:01:53.520> of<00:01:54.110> this<00:01:55.110> plant<00:01:55.439> it's<00:01:55.740> it's

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
the main draw of this plant it's it's

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.490 
the main draw of this plant it's it's
also<00:01:56.729> sold<00:01:57.030> in<00:01:57.240> ground<00:01:57.509> cover<00:01:57.750> form<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.380> it's

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
also sold in ground cover form and it's

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.929 
also sold in ground cover form and it's
sold<00:01:58.680> in<00:01:58.829> hanging<00:01:59.009> baskets<00:01:59.130> I've<00:01:59.700> seen<00:01:59.850> it

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
sold in hanging baskets I've seen it

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:00.410 
sold in hanging baskets I've seen it
that<00:02:00.090> way

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
that way

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.399 
that way
so<00:02:00.719> it<00:02:00.960> does<00:02:01.110> well<00:02:01.290> in<00:02:01.500> containers<00:02:02.189> too<00:02:02.640> and

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
so it does well in containers too and

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.760 
so it does well in containers too and
mine<00:02:04.439> I<00:02:04.740> have<00:02:05.040> not<00:02:05.189> watered<00:02:06.090> for<00:02:06.930> probably

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
mine I have not watered for probably

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.760 
mine I have not watered for probably
about<00:02:08.129> 9<00:02:08.520> or<00:02:08.879> 10<00:02:09.119> months<00:02:09.149> now<00:02:09.619> because<00:02:10.619> we<00:02:10.739> just

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
about 9 or 10 months now because we just

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:11.580 
about 9 or 10 months now because we just
haven't<00:02:11.069> any

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
haven't any

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.650 
haven't any
we<00:02:11.769> had<00:02:12.190> like<00:02:12.310> half<00:02:12.550> an<00:02:12.670> hour<00:02:12.760> an<00:02:13.090> hour<00:02:13.209> rain

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
we had like half an hour an hour rain

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.750 
we had like half an hour an hour rain
yesterday<00:02:14.110> that<00:02:14.290> was<00:02:14.410> it<00:02:14.830> for<00:02:15.099> the<00:02:15.250> whole<00:02:15.459> year

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
yesterday that was it for the whole year

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.390 
yesterday that was it for the whole year
so<00:02:16.060> I<00:02:16.269> haven't<00:02:16.989> supplementally<00:02:17.800> watered<00:02:18.220> it

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
so I haven't supplementally watered it

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.490 
so I haven't supplementally watered it
at<00:02:18.550> all<00:02:19.150> and<00:02:19.569> it's<00:02:19.690> putting<00:02:19.989> out<00:02:20.080> a<00:02:20.110> lot<00:02:20.470> of

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
at all and it's putting out a lot of

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.290 
at all and it's putting out a lot of
color<00:02:20.800> and<00:02:20.890> if<00:02:21.190> you<00:02:21.310> give<00:02:21.489> it<00:02:21.610> too<00:02:21.819> much<00:02:21.849> water

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
color and if you give it too much water

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.979 
color and if you give it too much water
it's<00:02:22.599> going<00:02:23.080> to<00:02:23.140> send<00:02:23.530> out<00:02:23.739> a<00:02:23.980> lot<00:02:24.310> of<00:02:24.610> like

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
it's going to send out a lot of like

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.869 
it's going to send out a lot of like
green<00:02:25.989> Ginger's<00:02:26.950> green<00:02:27.160> growth<00:02:27.430> it'll<00:02:27.700> just

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:27.879 
green Ginger's green growth it'll just

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:29.580 
green Ginger's green growth it'll just
shoot<00:02:28.120> up<00:02:28.299> it's<00:02:28.720> kind<00:02:28.900> of<00:02:28.959> the<00:02:29.080> sucker<00:02:29.290> broke

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
shoot up it's kind of the sucker broke

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.890 
shoot up it's kind of the sucker broke
you'll<00:02:29.980> see<00:02:30.190> it<00:02:30.280> at<00:02:30.849> the<00:02:31.209> base<00:02:31.390> of<00:02:31.420> the<00:02:31.629> plant

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
you'll see it at the base of the plant

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.330 
you'll see it at the base of the plant
when<00:02:32.080> we<00:02:32.230> zoom<00:02:32.260> in<00:02:32.680> on<00:02:33.519> that<00:02:33.970> so<00:02:34.480> I<00:02:34.690> hold<00:02:35.620> back

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
when we zoom in on that so I hold back

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.250 
when we zoom in on that so I hold back
on<00:02:36.549> the<00:02:36.670> water<00:02:36.879> because<00:02:37.390> I<00:02:37.420> want<00:02:37.720> it<00:02:37.810> to<00:02:38.080> have

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
on the water because I want it to have

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.589 
on the water because I want it to have
more<00:02:38.530> color<00:02:38.769> and<00:02:39.010> less<00:02:39.459> of<00:02:39.489> that<00:02:39.760> crazy<00:02:40.390> green

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
more color and less of that crazy green

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:42.420 
more color and less of that crazy green
growth<00:02:40.870> it's<00:02:41.440> also<00:02:41.590> less<00:02:41.860> for<00:02:42.010> me<00:02:42.099> to<00:02:42.160> prune

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
growth it's also less for me to prune

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.270 
growth it's also less for me to prune
too<00:02:43.000> but<00:02:43.630> when<00:02:44.110> you<00:02:44.230> are<00:02:44.349> establishing<00:02:45.069> one

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
too but when you are establishing one

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.180 
too but when you are establishing one
you<00:02:45.730> do<00:02:45.940> want<00:02:46.209> to<00:02:46.329> give<00:02:46.569> it<00:02:46.750> regular<00:02:47.440> water<00:02:47.680> but

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
you do want to give it regular water but

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.860 
you do want to give it regular water but
you<00:02:48.310> don't<00:02:48.519> want<00:02:48.670> to<00:02:48.730> keep<00:02:48.849> it<00:02:48.970> soaking<00:02:49.480> wet

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
you don't want to keep it soaking wet

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.020 
you don't want to keep it soaking wet
because<00:02:50.200> it<00:02:50.380> doesn't<00:02:50.590> like<00:02:50.829> to<00:02:50.890> be<00:02:51.040> really<00:02:51.819> wet

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
because it doesn't like to be really wet

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.259 
because it doesn't like to be really wet
it<00:02:52.180> likes<00:02:52.360> to<00:02:52.450> drain<00:02:52.780> really<00:02:53.140> well<00:02:53.319> also<00:02:54.269> the

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
it likes to drain really well also the

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.119 
it likes to drain really well also the
main<00:02:55.660> thing<00:02:55.959> for<00:02:56.260> you<00:02:56.500> to<00:02:56.650> know<00:02:56.680> when<00:02:57.010> you're

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:57.129 
main thing for you to know when you're

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:59.430 
main thing for you to know when you're
planting<00:02:57.430> a<00:02:57.730> Bugan<00:02:58.299> via<00:02:58.450> is<00:02:58.720> to<00:02:58.900> keep<00:02:59.110> it<00:02:59.319> in

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
planting a Bugan via is to keep it in

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.680 
planting a Bugan via is to keep it in
its<00:03:00.129> grow<00:03:00.430> pot<00:03:00.730> and<00:03:00.970> you<00:03:01.060> just<00:03:01.329> want<00:03:01.480> to<00:03:01.510> put

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
its grow pot and you just want to put

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.690 
its grow pot and you just want to put
slits<00:03:01.989> in<00:03:02.200> the<00:03:02.379> grow<00:03:02.500> pot<00:03:02.769> because<00:03:03.430> even

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
slits in the grow pot because even

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.400 
slits in the grow pot because even
though<00:03:03.790> it's<00:03:03.970> a<00:03:04.060> really<00:03:04.090> tough<00:03:04.629> plant<00:03:04.959> it<00:03:05.230> has

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
though it's a really tough plant it has

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.550 
though it's a really tough plant it has
thorns<00:03:05.829> that<00:03:06.430> it<00:03:06.790> grows<00:03:07.450> by<00:03:07.690> the<00:03:07.750> sea<00:03:08.049> it<00:03:08.349> grows

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
thorns that it grows by the sea it grows

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.199 
thorns that it grows by the sea it grows
up<00:03:08.590> at<00:03:08.860> the<00:03:08.950> hills<00:03:09.370> it<00:03:09.670> can<00:03:09.760> take<00:03:09.910> the<00:03:10.030> wind

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
up at the hills it can take the wind

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.300 
up at the hills it can take the wind
it's<00:03:10.480> a<00:03:10.720> big<00:03:10.840> baby<00:03:11.079> when<00:03:11.709> it<00:03:11.829> comes<00:03:12.010> to<00:03:12.160> being

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
it's a big baby when it comes to being

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.699 
it's a big baby when it comes to being
planted<00:03:12.610> so<00:03:13.299> you<00:03:13.360> don't<00:03:13.720> want<00:03:14.019> to<00:03:14.110> disturb<00:03:14.440> and

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
planted so you don't want to disturb and

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.410 
planted so you don't want to disturb and
the<00:03:14.980> root<00:03:15.129> system<00:03:15.489> and<00:03:15.670> that's<00:03:16.060> why<00:03:16.239> they're

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
the root system and that's why they're

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.050 
the root system and that's why they're
really<00:03:16.630> hard<00:03:16.959> to<00:03:17.049> transplant<00:03:17.769> also<00:03:18.730> they

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
really hard to transplant also they

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.789 
really hard to transplant also they
don't<00:03:19.209> transplant<00:03:20.049> too<00:03:20.200> well<00:03:20.380> because<00:03:20.590> they

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
don't transplant too well because they

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.559 
don't transplant too well because they
don't<00:03:20.980> like<00:03:21.130> to<00:03:21.160> be<00:03:21.400> disturbed<00:03:22.030> once<00:03:22.359> they've

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:22.569 
don't like to be disturbed once they've

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:24.420 
don't like to be disturbed once they've
been<00:03:22.769> established<00:03:23.769> this<00:03:23.980> will<00:03:24.160> be<00:03:24.250> sure<00:03:24.400> to

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
been established this will be sure to

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.699 
been established this will be sure to
keep<00:03:24.670> that<00:03:24.730> in<00:03:24.910> mind<00:03:25.299> and<00:03:25.840> when<00:03:26.290> you<00:03:26.380> plant<00:03:26.590> it

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
keep that in mind and when you plant it

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.900 
keep that in mind and when you plant it
just<00:03:26.859> plant<00:03:27.340> it<00:03:27.400> with<00:03:27.519> a<00:03:27.549> little<00:03:27.700> compost<00:03:28.510> or

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
just plant it with a little compost or

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.789 
just plant it with a little compost or
worm<00:03:30.910> castings<00:03:31.359> that's<00:03:31.599> what<00:03:31.780> I<00:03:31.959> use<00:03:32.500> for<00:03:32.530> all

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 
worm castings that's what I use for all

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:35.280 
worm castings that's what I use for all
my<00:03:33.099> plants<00:03:33.370> anyway<00:03:33.790> I<00:03:34.000> really<00:03:34.660> don't<00:03:34.930> give

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
my plants anyway I really don't give

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.890 
my plants anyway I really don't give
this<00:03:35.440> one<00:03:35.680> anything<00:03:36.359> supplemental<00:03:37.359> just
