00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
different at cookie con this year well I

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.789 
different at cookie con this year well I
think<00:00:11.340> the<00:00:11.490> biggest<00:00:11.820> difference<00:00:12.120> is<00:00:12.750> the<00:00:13.170> way

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
think the biggest difference is the way

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.560 
think the biggest difference is the way
that<00:00:14.009> we're<00:00:14.190> doing<00:00:14.280> classes<00:00:14.880> this<00:00:15.000> year<00:00:15.059> and

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
that we're doing classes this year and

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.160 
that we're doing classes this year and
last<00:00:15.599> year<00:00:16.109> we<00:00:16.320> had<00:00:16.640> all<00:00:17.640> 200<00:00:18.449> in<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.960> same

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
last year we had all 200 in the same

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.019 
last year we had all 200 in the same
class<00:00:19.439> and<00:00:19.830> we<00:00:19.949> just<00:00:20.189> rotated<00:00:20.789> out<00:00:20.880> the

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
class and we just rotated out the

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.140 
class and we just rotated out the
teachers<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:21.689> it<00:00:22.560> was<00:00:22.740> kind<00:00:23.460> of<00:00:23.519> fun<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.880> have

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
teachers and it was kind of fun to have

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.740 
teachers and it was kind of fun to have
everybody<00:00:24.330> all<00:00:24.900> together<00:00:25.080> but<00:00:26.300> the<00:00:27.300> people<00:00:27.689> in

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
everybody all together but the people in

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.500 
everybody all together but the people in
the<00:00:27.840> back<00:00:27.990> end<00:00:28.289> see<00:00:28.529> they<00:00:28.800> got<00:00:28.980> here<00:00:29.369> so<00:00:29.820> this

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
the back end see they got here so this

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.720 
the back end see they got here so this
year<00:00:30.810> we<00:00:31.260> decided<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.800> divide<00:00:32.130> them<00:00:32.340> up<00:00:32.460> and

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
year we decided to divide them up and

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.389 
year we decided to divide them up and
have<00:00:33.329> them<00:00:33.510> rotate<00:00:33.960> among<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.739> teachers<00:00:34.920> and

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
have them rotate among the teachers and

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.520 
have them rotate among the teachers and
so<00:00:35.610> they<00:00:36.059> have<00:00:36.180> smaller<00:00:36.510> class<00:00:36.600> sizes<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.500> I

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
so they have smaller class sizes and I

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.610 
so they have smaller class sizes and I
think<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:37.890> has<00:00:38.070> fostered<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.969> more<00:00:39.620> discussion

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
think it has fostered a more discussion

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.380 
think it has fostered a more discussion
kind<00:00:41.040> of<00:00:41.219> atmosphere<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.910> they're<00:00:42.090> able<00:00:42.180> to

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
kind of atmosphere and they're able to

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.490 
kind of atmosphere and they're able to
ask<00:00:42.510> questions<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:43.230> find<00:00:43.290> out<00:00:43.730> answers<00:00:44.730> to

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
ask questions and find out answers to

ask questions and find out answers to
