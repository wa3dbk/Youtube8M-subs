00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
again we're in Parratt Virginia this is

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.189 
again we're in Parratt Virginia this is
a<00:00:53.760> Norfolk<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.270> southern<00:00:54.539> line<00:00:57.109> we're<00:00:58.109> gonna

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
a Norfolk and southern line we're gonna

00:00:58.199 --> 00:04:19.180 
a Norfolk and southern line we're gonna
wave<00:00:58.469> maybe<00:00:58.829> he'll<00:00:59.010> haunt<00:00:59.160> for<00:00:59.250> us

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.780 

so<00:04:19.730> that<00:04:19.940> was<00:04:20.090> a<00:04:20.120> Norfolk<00:04:20.630> and<00:04:20.840> Southern<00:04:21.140> Train

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:21.790 
so that was a Norfolk and Southern Train

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.330 
so that was a Norfolk and Southern Train
looked<00:04:22.790> like<00:04:22.940> everything<00:04:23.420> was<00:04:23.540> basically<00:04:23.780> a

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
looked like everything was basically a

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.750 
looked like everything was basically a
guess<00:04:25.340> what's<00:04:25.550> it<00:04:25.640> called<00:04:25.790> a<00:04:25.910> coal<00:04:26.090> hopper<00:04:27.760> the

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
guess what's it called a coal hopper the

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.640 
guess what's it called a coal hopper the
trains<00:04:29.030> are<00:04:29.180> here<00:04:29.330> are<00:04:29.480> really<00:04:30.230> really<00:04:30.500> long

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
trains are here are really really long

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.140 
trains are here are really really long
this<00:04:30.980> isn't<00:04:31.280> terribly<00:04:31.610> far<00:04:31.790> from<00:04:32.000> West

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
this isn't terribly far from West

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.260 
this isn't terribly far from West
Virginian<00:04:32.600> from<00:04:32.780> the<00:04:32.900> coal<00:04:33.080> mines<00:04:33.320> and<00:04:34.270> coal

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
Virginian from the coal mines and coal

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.480 
Virginian from the coal mines and coal
trains<00:04:35.600> through<00:04:35.780> here<00:04:35.990> we'll<00:04:36.140> just<00:04:36.350> be<00:04:36.500> car

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
trains through here we'll just be car

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.480 
trains through here we'll just be car
after<00:04:37.940> car<00:04:37.970> after<00:04:38.480> car<00:04:39.040> obviously<00:04:40.040> it<00:04:40.400> was

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
after car after car obviously it was

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.290 
after car after car obviously it was
empty<00:04:40.730> we<00:04:41.390> only<00:04:41.540> had<00:04:41.720> two<00:04:41.870> engines<00:04:42.200> pulling<00:04:42.440> it

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
empty we only had two engines pulling it

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.340 
empty we only had two engines pulling it
it'll<00:04:44.300> probably<00:04:44.330> come<00:04:44.660> back<00:04:44.870> through<00:04:45.080> at<00:04:45.200> some

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350 
it'll probably come back through at some

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.000 
it'll probably come back through at some
point<00:04:45.590> loaded<00:04:46.100> with<00:04:46.220> coal<00:04:46.400> and<00:04:47.920> being<00:04:48.920> this

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
point loaded with coal and being this

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:50.560 
point loaded with coal and being this
close<00:04:49.160> to<00:04:49.430> the<00:04:49.520> tracks<00:04:49.790> I<00:04:50.030> could<00:04:50.180> see<00:04:50.360> the

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:50.570 
close to the tracks I could see the

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:57.990 
close to the tracks I could see the
rails<00:04:51.290> flexing<00:04:52.130> as<00:04:52.670> the<00:04:53.300> cars<00:04:53.510> went<00:04:53.750> by<00:04:56.440> and

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
rails flexing as the cars went by and

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.220 
rails flexing as the cars went by and
walking<00:04:59.000> on<00:04:59.150> the<00:04:59.390> tracks<00:04:59.630> in<00:04:59.840> this<00:04:59.990> quiet

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:00.230 
walking on the tracks in this quiet

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.020 
walking on the tracks in this quiet
place<00:05:00.350> I<00:05:00.830> didn't<00:05:01.250> hear<00:05:01.400> it<00:05:01.490> until<00:05:01.640> it<00:05:01.910> was

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
place I didn't hear it until it was

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.360 
place I didn't hear it until it was
probably<00:05:02.300> a<00:05:02.390> hundred<00:05:02.510> yards<00:05:02.930> from<00:05:03.080> me<00:05:03.370> or

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
probably a hundred yards from me or

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.190 
probably a hundred yards from me or
something<00:05:04.670> so<00:05:04.910> large<00:05:05.210> these<00:05:05.480> things<00:05:05.720> are<00:05:05.870> so

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
something so large these things are so

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:12.730 
something so large these things are so
quiet<00:05:10.900> we're<00:05:11.900> gonna<00:05:12.020> walk<00:05:12.200> up<00:05:12.350> here<00:05:12.470> and<00:05:12.530> get<00:05:12.710> a

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
quiet we're gonna walk up here and get a

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.250 
quiet we're gonna walk up here and get a
better<00:05:12.890> look<00:05:13.160> at<00:05:13.310> this<00:05:13.580> light<00:05:14.480> post<00:05:14.750> before<00:05:15.020> we
