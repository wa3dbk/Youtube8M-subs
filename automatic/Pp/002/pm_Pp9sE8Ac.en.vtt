00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.210 
because it's smaller but no you don't
want<00:06:46.080> to<00:06:46.140> do<00:06:46.230> this<00:06:46.380> if<00:06:46.560> you're<00:06:46.680> gonna<00:06:46.890> do<00:06:47.100> the

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:47.220 
want to do this if you're gonna do the

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.550 
want to do this if you're gonna do the
808<00:06:47.730> just<00:06:48.480> do<00:06:48.660> it<00:06:48.690> with<00:06:48.960> the<00:06:49.080> nightmares

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:49.560 
808 just do it with the nightmares

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.490 
808 just do it with the nightmares
honestly<00:06:50.430> and<00:06:51.390> plus<00:06:51.840> there's<00:06:52.050> more<00:06:52.260> action

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:52.500 
honestly and plus there's more action

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.800 
honestly and plus there's more action
when<00:06:52.890> you<00:06:53.010> have<00:06:53.160> a<00:06:53.190> 16<00:06:53.640> or<00:06:53.700> 16<00:06:54.150> is<00:06:54.240> more<00:06:54.450> hectic

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:54.810 
when you have a 16 or 16 is more hectic

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:56.990 
when you have a 16 or 16 is more hectic
so<00:06:55.260> if<00:06:55.350> you<00:06:55.440> make<00:06:55.620> those<00:06:55.770> maps<00:06:56.040> AC<00:06:56.370> on<00:06:56.550> 16<00:06:56.910> is

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:57.000 
so if you make those maps AC on 16 is

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.070 
so if you make those maps AC on 16 is
way<00:06:57.150> better<00:06:57.590> and<00:06:59.270> or<00:07:00.270> another<00:07:00.690> thing<00:07:00.870> you<00:07:00.960> guys

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:01.080 
way better and or another thing you guys

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:04.310 
way better and or another thing you guys
can<00:07:01.320> do<00:07:01.470> is<00:07:02.340> basically<00:07:02.550> make<00:07:02.910> it<00:07:03.030> 16<00:07:03.510> on<00:07:03.660> 16<00:07:04.140> and

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:04.320 
can do is basically make it 16 on 16 and

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.710 
can do is basically make it 16 on 16 and
eight<00:07:04.590> on<00:07:04.770> 8<00:07:04.980> and<00:07:05.100> basically<00:07:05.610> if<00:07:05.910> people<00:07:06.570> don't

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:06.720

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:08.460 
like the 16 on 16 they can play small

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:10.880 
like the 16 on 16 they can play small
