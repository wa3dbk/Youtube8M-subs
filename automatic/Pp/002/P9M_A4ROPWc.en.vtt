00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.330 
alright I guess we I guess we got all of
our<00:01:51.270> luck<00:01:51.570> on<00:01:51.780> that<00:01:51.810> MJ<00:01:52.380> pack<00:01:52.680> so<00:01:53.130> we're

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
our luck on that MJ pack so we're

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.889 
our luck on that MJ pack so we're
definitely<00:01:53.549> gonna<00:01:54.000> get<00:01:54.180> some<00:01:54.390> duplicates

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
definitely gonna get some duplicates

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.200 
definitely gonna get some duplicates
with<00:01:55.140> these<00:01:55.320> los<00:01:55.560> angeles<00:01:56.040> lakers<00:01:56.520> but<00:01:57.090> it

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
with these los angeles lakers but it

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.120 
with these los angeles lakers but it
isn't<00:01:57.479> too<00:01:57.630> bad<00:01:57.899> because<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.439> price<00:01:58.680> of<00:01:58.920> these

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
isn't too bad because the price of these

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.399 
isn't too bad because the price of these
packs<00:01:59.460> isn't<00:01:59.909> as<00:02:00.000> much<00:02:00.030> as<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.719> chicago<00:02:01.200> bulls

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
packs isn't as much as the chicago bulls

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.100 
packs isn't as much as the chicago bulls

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
I was actually expecting to go broke on

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.990 
I was actually expecting to go broke on
the<00:02:04.170> Chicago<00:02:04.860> Bulls<00:02:05.100> packs<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.700> be<00:02:05.790> quite

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000
