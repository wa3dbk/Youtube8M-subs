 intimate and I welcome you 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.500
 for this new jt agitated geek with these 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.210
 weeks a special rather a usb key 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.619
 double usb connection and micro usb 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.180
 because see the products in photo 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.160
 it's good but seeing it on video is 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.779
 better then unbridled you and cover them 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.350
 all noted saitek live from shenzhen 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.340
 in China 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.480
 she explains to you all that after 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.480
 generic is good geek 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.239
 today today today these 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:45.110
 Tuesday and Tuesday we will test a small 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:46.850
 product so that's going to be relatively 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.260
 short we should not be able to hold ten 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.970
 minutes and yet this product is there 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.589
 interesting and you will see it better no 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.089
 not here but you'll see it better here 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:55.699
 that's going to happen like that a part that 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:57.019
 look at me there myself and a part that 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:58.790
 would have a little zoom in pay 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:00:59.960
 but like that tac and here and there we see 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.969
 right now the product 1 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.589
 it's still rather blatant so 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:03.920
 what is it thesis here it's a key 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:05.750
 usb 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.460
 that turns out like all the keys 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.450
 usb that you could have 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:13.070
 and here we remove the cap and we have the 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.649
 price of the cap that will be difficult to 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.330
 lose but you can lose that I 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:19.310
 believe in yourself and on that side there we go 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.729
 find a micro usb 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.960
 yeah so the benefits of the usb key 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:24.380
 it's actually that you'll be able to 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.720
 recharge 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.399
 charging and charging and finally 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.509
 load and late may stuff finally 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:33.080
 to put files illegally 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:35.659
 downloaded on torrents not 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.979
 possible directly in fact in life 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:39.020
 I will put them in your computer 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.640
 here and there inform you all yours 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.720
 your files and when you will have them 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.640
 need to put it on your 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.530
 computer so watch out for others at 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.640
 on your phone 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.739
 so be careful you have to 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.970
 phone be compatible otg years by 

00:01:48.739 --> 00:01:56.330
 example have not learned to 1 but yeah I 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.610
 know more which assad to saint pee 6 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.099
 so here we put it we put the key on the 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.440
 top tac 

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:05.330
 this is the light up so go well 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.160
 recognized by the phone that tell you 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.080
 attention we have prepared a usb key 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.360
 here is the installation to block your skis 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.900
 said comfort and it will be necessary to put 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.640
 unknown sources here tak tak here and 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.590
 you will find yourself with a 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.060
 fashion tricks to saints Chinese fans 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.370
 you have good to find the usb key 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.430
 we redid it here I redo it we remove it 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:31.250
 if we do not kill the stora removed 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:32.030
 put the key back on and there it 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.920
 prepare the usb key 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.750
 so it will be rather practical is that 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.730
 you will be able to put your files 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.680
 directly into the usb key on your 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.969
 computer and bind them directly on 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.130
 your tablet or on your smartphone 

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:44.900
 via the connectors 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.340
 micro usb and that's more traumatic 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.230
 so be careful every 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.000
 phones are not otg there is a 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.680
 little list I know that opposes them 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.720
 almost all in the last series 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.260
 are otg but it's a model that does not 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.030
 are not for example my johnny is 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.180
 not at the tgv we can not win at all 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.560
 shots 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.230
 so what would we have liked 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.270
 it's a usb stick and micro usb 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.520
 in fact there are other models but 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.500
 actually the other model just you 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.640
 are sure there are two small cache in 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.350
 plastic there is no task 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.820
 keychains to be pretty sure of 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.260
 lose each time so there we are at 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.180
 less with that one is still on a 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.710
 product which is rather nice so there good 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.970
 you will have seen some good there there is in 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.620
 not the logos after souleymane is like 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.910
 that because the sister series we do 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.410
 that brand sister brand it was doing 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.310
 the external batteries until we 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.680
 can not send them to konÃ© anymore 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.210
 carry the one who will provide you the 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.170
 usb keys because they are rather cali 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:31.460
 and it's pretty cool 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.680
 so in fact we would have liked 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:35.000
 two sizes so in fact I asked 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.530
 what an iphone and dessau shop 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.730
 they will propose the keys they will 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.380
 is only available in two sizes in 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.600
 16th in thirty two because the cases 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.140
 still relatively small and target 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.000
 a USB key 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.180
 do you buy at least one entry 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.050
 ga'hoole 32 gigas so the cegid are 14 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:53.420
 90 euros cheap and 32 gigabytes ladies 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.890
 and gentlemen 19 euros 90 which you 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.630
 can find them directly in the 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.740
 sky fauna shop losc iphon.fr august 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.520
 in the list the shop or one of the 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.900
 point fr 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.300
 the two shops selling almost 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.680
 same products at the same price we did well 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.120
 liked the fact that these plug n play you 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.410
 put on your computer if recognized 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.640
 like a usb key you put on your 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:08.090
 phone is also recognized as a 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.620
 USB key 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.850
 it will transfer a little bit 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.709
 the files from one to the other that will be 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.360
 still more practical on Arabic is born 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:16.280
 but the fact that there is a tie 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.200
 keychain it's pretty handy but at 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.250
 less these little details but their - 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.180
 you can put with your club and 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.980
 especially not lose it that a usb key 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.810
 without ties it's true it's not 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.130
 always practical and finally we will have liked 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.870
 the colors so there as it is the 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.430
 symbol that the keys will only arrive 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.020
 so for you because we have a day 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.970
 of advanced we arrive that tomorrow after 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.290
 noon it was absolutely necessary 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.700
 therefore think that they will arrive in blue 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:39.650
 yeah in white yeah in red 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.270
 yeah and right finally because he 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.270
 needed a little bit so that will do 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.590
 white black and red and blue 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.210
 after that you will be able to choose 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.740
 clothes and usb keys the dots 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.030
 negatives we did not find we tried 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.500
 to watch we say why this 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.160
 negative low nothing except it's 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.600
 just awesome 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.729
 and admit that it's a small 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.050
 gadget safra be like a christmas is coming 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:57.789
 a 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:01.240
 very good gift idea for you or for 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:02.470
 offer and it's also a very usb key 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.159
 soon practices that you can 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.270
 leave your smartphone 

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:06.280
 and that's really the difference guys 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.360
 the night you download your movies on 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.250
 morning where was the usb key 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.229
 however you bother with the micro sd 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.060
 the stuff stuff or put a card and 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:14.259
 after put to a memory card reader 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.530
 where you take off the thing 

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:18.699
 takjout do it again by then he has 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.860
 failed you 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:22.120
 it is 9 so it's a little bit 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.889
 hard you take off there you put in 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.659
 your computer and it's not bad then 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:27.129
 the only negative point actually is it's not 

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:28.240
 usb keys as like other 

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:29.800
 did not think it was a usb key 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.330
 normal on which he had tinkered in 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.710
 does not it's really usb keys that 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.690
 are made like that with both 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.830
 connectors so that's why 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.180
 do we can not know it the same day 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.229

 will have tomorrow but I can tell you that 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:42.550
 ordered a lot it will go from the stock 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.569
 here is a usb key rather nice and I 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.979

 means that you have already purchased 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:53.379
 maybe at home or elsewhere but 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:54.430

 before this video on the networks 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.590
 social with the small link the r of 

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:12.759
 comments in ten years that for this 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:14.560
 get better and it's not good 

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:16.389

 looks good where you will have a + 64 giga 

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:21.419
 to do anything but it's still 

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:24.130
 interesting and possibly the r of 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:25.509
 green thumb like that yeah that's too much 

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:26.770
