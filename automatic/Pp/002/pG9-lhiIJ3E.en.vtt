00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
whole entire time and and I think

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.110 
whole entire time and and I think
between<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.160> three<00:02:27.250> of<00:02:27.400> us<00:02:27.580> it's<00:02:27.820> his<00:02:27.940> song

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
between the three of us it's his song

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.850 
between the three of us it's his song
that<00:02:28.330> we've<00:02:28.420> played<00:02:28.630> so<00:02:28.900> many<00:02:29.080> times<00:02:29.320> and<00:02:29.560> song

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
that we've played so many times and song

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.200 
that we've played so many times and song
that<00:02:29.980> we<00:02:30.070> obviously<00:02:30.970> hold<00:02:31.510> dear<00:02:31.720> to<00:02:31.780> us<00:02:31.930> and<00:02:32.320> so

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
that we obviously hold dear to us and so

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.290 
that we obviously hold dear to us and so
so<00:02:34.210> I<00:02:34.240> think<00:02:34.390> that<00:02:34.690> that<00:02:35.340> on<00:02:36.340> one<00:02:36.610> hand<00:02:36.640> like<00:02:37.090> it

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
so I think that that on one hand like it

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.930 
so I think that that on one hand like it
just<00:02:37.720> the<00:02:37.900> familiarity<00:02:38.800> of<00:02:39.130> the<00:02:39.250> song<00:02:39.640> like

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
just the familiarity of the song like

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.520 
just the familiarity of the song like
kind<00:02:40.120> of<00:02:40.210> takes<00:02:40.360> over<00:02:40.600> but<00:02:40.750> but<00:02:41.110> on<00:02:41.320> the<00:02:41.440> other

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
kind of takes over but but on the other

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.580 
kind of takes over but but on the other
hand<00:02:41.770> it's<00:02:42.010> like<00:02:42.810> how<00:02:43.810> special<00:02:44.050> the<00:02:44.290> night<00:02:44.440> is
