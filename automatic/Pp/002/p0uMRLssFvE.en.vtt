00:00:00.139 --> 00:00:05.549
 hello dear friends welcome to me 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:09.600
 channel today I'm going to talk to you 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:12.990
 about nail fungus though 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:15.740
 it's true it's not so common to have 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.330
 Fingernail fungus but 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:21.269
 normally I have consulted with several 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.630
 people and they have nail fungus 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:27.029
 the feet sometimes for being this a little 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.970
 unhygienic we touch our nails 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.810
 the feet with our hands and that's where 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:37.740
 the fungus is produced in the nails of the 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:39.600
 fingers well how can you find or how 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.000
 you can notice that you have fungi in the 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.910
 fingernails is because by the 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.270
 sides by the side of the sides 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.660
 begins to form 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.180
 some lumps starts to eat the nail already 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.140
 can not grow and your nails do not grow 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.320
 among others 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.050
 well a very practical way to 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.120
 eliminate or decrease or at least not 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.720
 make you sting 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.850
 in the fungus of the nails is this 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.090
 wonderful product that not only 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.100
 you use to wash yourself evenly 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.520
 the teeth but you will use it 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.470
 to diminish or attenuate the fungus of 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.659
 nails if you like you can do less 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.000
 clear toenails that you have to 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.090
 engineer to see how it is that you're going to 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.460
 use this product well the 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.700
 general recommendations that I give 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.149
 is that they have to consult with their 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.160
 Podiatrist or consult with your doctor 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:42.390
 general to see what it tells them to 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:44.580
 says if it is right or not right 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.210
 Use this product particularly 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:51.479
 I use it because well I have such 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.119
 Once a mushroom principle seems to me 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.130
 in this nail that is in this one that is 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:00.149
 rare media at least for me I 'm going to 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.369
 narrate to medium it seems to me that 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.710
 maybe there is a scope there then I 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.600
 I 've always been in been beaten with the 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.259
 listerine that we will not use 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.720
 with this criterion in class 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.640
 it's really wonderful I know 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.159
 I recommend in a particular way to me 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.500
 It goes very well with this product but let's go 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:22.970
 to see if it is that you are going to 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:25.280
 please or if you use it well what 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.069
 What we are going to do is take a little boat 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.709
 a small boat so small for not 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:34.310
 waste a lot the sterile and they go to 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:38.150
 proceed to throw your content over or 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:41.989
 less so that it covers the nail well now 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:44.510
 Well, what we 're going to do is put your 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:47.120
 pretty here in the estadi you have to 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:51.260
 hold more or less for five minutes 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:54.109
 they have to be a good time and so that 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:57.139
 at least penetrate can be content 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:59.389
 of listerine in her pretty and how do I 

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:01.790
 I say I have the slight impression that 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:05.180
 I have a cuff there and that's why 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:07.519
 I use this and good at analyzing the 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.590
 seen that it has improved me a lot because 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:12.409
 I had many tiny spots on the nail very 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.150
 little ones in the nail and I think I think 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:16.489
 that are ccoo but there's no good 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.440
 consulted but I prevent with this 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:21.699
 product the truth and while we go 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:25.430
 waiting for those five minutes that I 

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:28.910
 I want him to absorb well in this video me 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.530
 I'm going to eat a chubby and I do not 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:34.209
 there are many 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.209
 I take advantage of the trade in pretty 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:42.730
 It's all half while I wait 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:45.940

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:50.920
 effect on me is fine you wanted 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:52.690
 friends after I had it 5 out of 5 to 10 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.910
 minutes depends on you how much 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:58.820
 endure withdrawal 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:01.400
 and here is my half and I proceed to 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:04.220
 remove it with a cotton cited all the 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.500
 surplus if you like 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.840
