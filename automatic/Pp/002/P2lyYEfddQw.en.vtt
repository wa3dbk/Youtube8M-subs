00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
which is usually a hundred percent to

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.950 
which is usually a hundred percent to
begin<00:00:17.760> with<00:00:17.970> but<00:00:18.330> we're<00:00:18.449> gonna<00:00:18.539> change<00:00:18.779> this

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
begin with but we're gonna change this

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.630 
begin with but we're gonna change this
all<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.590> way<00:00:19.650> at<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.800> left<00:00:20.010> so<00:00:20.310> that<00:00:20.340> goes

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
all the way at the left so that goes

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.400 
all the way at the left so that goes
down<00:00:20.760> to<00:00:20.820> one<00:00:21.119> percent<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:21.689> then<00:00:21.840> finally<00:00:22.230> off

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
down to one percent and then finally off

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.380 
down to one percent and then finally off
and<00:00:23.010> what<00:00:23.130> that<00:00:23.279> does<00:00:23.430> is<00:00:23.640> it<00:00:23.789> just<00:00:23.910> says<00:00:24.119> how

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
and what that does is it just says how

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.609 
and what that does is it just says how
much<00:00:24.570> of<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.810> crowd<00:00:25.019> is<00:00:25.170> actually<00:00:25.289> in<00:00:25.500> the

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
all the deal in there it's kind of odd

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.020 
all the deal in there it's kind of odd
that<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.559> can<00:01:01.680> hear<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.100> crowd<00:01:02.309> but<00:01:02.969> I

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
that you can hear the crowd but I

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.460 
that you can hear the crowd but I
suppose<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.359> can<00:01:03.539> turn<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.780> off<00:01:03.870> in<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.140> audio

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
suppose you can turn it off in the audio

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.410 
suppose you can turn it off in the audio
sentence<00:01:04.860> if<00:01:04.949> you<00:01:05.040> just<00:01:05.189> remove<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.180> sound

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
sentence if you just remove the sound

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.530 
sentence if you just remove the sound
effects<00:01:07.580> so<00:01:08.580> I'll<00:01:08.729> just<00:01:08.939> skip<00:01:09.180> Cena's

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
effects so I'll just skip Cena's

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.640 
effects so I'll just skip Cena's
entrance<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.080> can<00:01:10.170> see<00:01:10.260> Roman<00:01:10.530> reigns

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
come through without the crowd there you

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.649 
come through without the crowd there you
can<00:01:14.549> see<00:01:14.670> actually<00:01:14.939> all<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.119> detail<00:01:15.420> on<00:01:15.450> the
