00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
break it when you're pushing the sides

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.949 
break it when you're pushing the sides
down<00:02:57.420> but<00:02:57.840> got<00:02:58.380> it<00:02:58.470> all<00:02:58.620> closed<00:02:59.780> let's<00:03:00.780> go

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
down but got it all closed let's go

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.180 
down but got it all closed let's go
ahead<00:03:01.110> and<00:03:02.360> turn<00:03:03.360> this<00:03:03.630> device<00:03:03.840> on<00:03:04.200> so<00:03:04.830> this<00:03:04.980> is

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
ahead and turn this device on so this is

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.570 
ahead and turn this device on so this is
a<00:03:05.220> 5<00:03:05.640> inch<00:03:06.290> HD<00:03:07.290> display<00:03:07.320> since<00:03:08.070> it<00:03:08.220> doesn't<00:03:08.490> say

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
a 5 inch HD display since it doesn't say

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.540

Full<00:03:08.880> HD<00:03:09.060> like<00:03:09.600> the<00:03:09.720> Studio<00:03:10.019> 6<00:03:10.470> I'm<00:03:10.739> guessing

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
Full HD like the Studio 6 I'm guessing

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.210
