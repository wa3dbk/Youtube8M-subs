 strong strong in the sense when it 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.720
 produces true attention in the 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.989
 interview like the one that has happened with 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.430
 rafael correa with álvaro uribe but you 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.840

 Álvaro noboa was also an interview 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.830

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.299
