player has I'm in creative so I don't
have<00:04:02.510> that<00:04:02.780> right<00:04:02.989> now<00:04:03.340> so<00:04:04.340> that's<00:04:04.880> pretty

much that for all the commands and now
we're<00:04:07.640> going<00:04:07.790> to<00:04:07.880> add<00:04:08.090> the<00:04:08.420> world<00:04:08.660> border<00:04:09.140> so

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
we're going to add the world border so

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.030 
we're going to add the world border so
to<00:04:09.650> do<00:04:09.860> that<00:04:10.010> type<00:04:10.310> in<00:04:10.489> flash<00:04:10.850> world<00:04:12.040> border

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
to do that type in flash world border

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.970 
to do that type in flash world border
like<00:04:13.550> that<00:04:13.880> and<00:04:14.320> then<00:04:15.320> we're<00:04:15.440> gonna<00:04:15.560> do<00:04:15.709> world

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
like that and then we're gonna do world

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.250 
like that and then we're gonna do world
border<00:04:16.280> sets<00:04:16.820> and<00:04:17.060> we're<00:04:17.780> gonna<00:04:17.870> set<00:04:18.109> it<00:04:18.140> to

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
border sets and we're gonna set it to

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.880 
border sets and we're gonna set it to
2000<00:04:18.919> blocks<00:04:19.190> now<00:04:20.000> keep<00:04:20.690> in<00:04:20.810> mind<00:04:20.840> 2000<00:04:21.650> blocks

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:21.890 
2000 blocks now keep in mind 2000 blocks

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:23.529 
2000 blocks now keep in mind 2000 blocks
is<00:04:22.130> the<00:04:22.310> diameter<00:04:22.700> so<00:04:23.210> if<00:04:23.300> we<00:04:23.419> actually

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:23.539 
is the diameter so if we actually

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:26.440 
is the diameter so if we actually
teleport<00:04:24.229> to<00:04:24.470> 1000<00:04:25.160> 1000<00:04:25.729> right<00:04:25.820> now<00:04:26.000> we<00:04:26.330> will

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
teleport to 1000 1000 right now we will

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:27.560 
teleport to 1000 1000 right now we will
be<00:04:26.570> at<00:04:26.660> the<00:04:26.690> corner<00:04:27.080> of<00:04:27.110> the<00:04:27.260> world

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
be at the corner of the world

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.320 
be at the corner of the world
order<00:04:27.780> so<00:04:28.470> it's<00:04:29.010> only<00:04:29.130> going<00:04:29.370> 1,000<00:04:30.150> blocks

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
order so it's only going 1,000 blocks

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.290 
order so it's only going 1,000 blocks
from<00:04:30.510> the<00:04:30.690> center<00:04:31.110> not<00:04:31.680> some<00:04:32.070> not<00:04:32.490> 2000<00:04:33.090> to

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
from the center not some not 2000 to

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.600 
from the center not some not 2000 to
thousands<00:04:33.660> of<00:04:33.720> the<00:04:33.780> diameter<00:04:34.290> you<00:04:34.490> can<00:04:35.490> also

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
thousands of the diameter you can also

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.250 
thousands of the diameter you can also
adjust<00:04:35.970> this<00:04:36.240> number<00:04:36.300> depending<00:04:36.990> on<00:04:37.110> how<00:04:37.200> many

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
adjust this number depending on how many

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.590 
adjust this number depending on how many
players<00:04:37.560> you<00:04:37.830> have<00:04:38.040> I<00:04:38.370> find<00:04:39.150> this<00:04:39.240> number<00:04:39.390> to

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
players you have I find this number to

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.310 
players you have I find this number to
be<00:04:39.690> good<00:04:39.900> not<00:04:40.230> too<00:04:40.380> big<00:04:40.530> not<00:04:40.560> too<00:04:40.890> small<00:04:40.920> and

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
be good not too big not too small and

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.080 
be good not too big not too small and
yeah<00:04:43.320> so<00:04:43.860> now<00:04:44.340> we're<00:04:44.580> going<00:04:44.730> to<00:04:44.880> want<00:04:45.030> to

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
yeah so now we're going to want to

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.540 
yeah so now we're going to want to
spread<00:04:45.510> the<00:04:45.690> players<00:04:45.960> out<00:04:46.200> so<00:04:47.070> this<00:04:47.220> is<00:04:47.280> gonna

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
spread the players out so this is gonna

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.070 
spread the players out so this is gonna
what<00:04:47.760> once<00:04:48.060> everybody<00:04:48.390> joins<00:04:48.690> and<00:04:48.960> once

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
what once everybody joins and once

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.840 
what once everybody joins and once
they've<00:04:49.320> all<00:04:49.530> you've<00:04:49.980> added<00:04:50.280> them<00:04:50.520> to<00:04:50.700> each

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
they've all you've added them to each

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.060 
they've all you've added them to each
team<00:04:51.120> and<00:04:51.420> stuff<00:04:51.680> then<00:04:52.680> you're<00:04:52.770> gonna<00:04:52.890> want<00:04:53.040> to

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
team and stuff then you're gonna want to

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.770 
team and stuff then you're gonna want to
spend<00:04:53.310> them<00:04:53.400> out<00:04:53.490> to<00:04:53.670> do<00:04:53.820> that<00:04:53.940> slash<00:04:54.390> spread

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
spend them out to do that slash spread

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.020 
spend them out to do that slash spread
players<00:04:55.400> we're<00:04:56.400> gonna<00:04:56.490> spread<00:04:56.760> them<00:04:56.910> around

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
players we're gonna spread them around

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.440 
players we're gonna spread them around
the<00:04:57.270> origin<00:04:57.570> so<00:04:57.870> around<00:04:58.110> zero<00:04:58.560> zero<00:04:59.450> then

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
the origin so around zero zero then

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.590 
the origin so around zero zero then
we're<00:05:00.570> spreading<00:05:00.840> them<00:05:01.050> out<00:05:01.170> to<00:05:02.510> we're<00:05:03.510> gonna

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
we're spreading them out to we're gonna

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.950 
we're spreading them out to we're gonna
spread<00:05:03.900> them<00:05:04.050> out<00:05:04.140> 300<00:05:04.800> blocks<00:05:05.040> apart<00:05:05.400> and<00:05:05.960> the

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
spread them out 300 blocks apart and the

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.350 
spread them out 300 blocks apart and the
maximum<00:05:07.380> they<00:05:07.620> can<00:05:07.740> be<00:05:07.860> spread<00:05:08.130> out<00:05:08.340> is<00:05:08.580> one

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
maximum they can be spread out is one

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.680 
maximum they can be spread out is one
thousand<00:05:09.840> blocks<00:05:10.760> one<00:05:11.760> thousand<00:05:12.120> blocks<00:05:12.300> like

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
thousand blocks one thousand blocks like

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.930 
thousand blocks one thousand blocks like
that<00:05:12.870> so<00:05:13.680> that's<00:05:14.250> that<00:05:14.460> then<00:05:14.730> we're<00:05:14.850> gonna

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
that so that's that then we're gonna

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.170 
that so that's that then we're gonna
type<00:05:15.240> in<00:05:15.390> true<00:05:16.020> and<00:05:16.350> what<00:05:17.340> that<00:05:17.490> true<00:05:17.700> means<00:05:17.910> is

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
type in true and what that true means is

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.510 
type in true and what that true means is
we're<00:05:18.570> going<00:05:18.720> to<00:05:18.870> teleport<00:05:19.650> teammates<00:05:20.190> next

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520

we're going to teleport teammates next
to<00:05:20.610> each<00:05:20.700> other<00:05:20.850> so<00:05:21.330> that<00:05:21.780> way<00:05:22.620> if<00:05:22.890> there's<00:05:23.100> two

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
to each other so that way if there's two

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:24.740 
to each other so that way if there's two
people<00:05:23.490> on<00:05:23.580> the<00:05:23.670> blue<00:05:23.850> team<00:05:24.060> both<00:05:24.450> of<00:05:24.630> them

will be teleported to the same spot and

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.270 
will be teleported to the same spot and
then<00:05:27.990> we're<00:05:28.080> gonna<00:05:28.170> want<00:05:28.410> to<00:05:28.500> say<00:05:28.680> teleport
