00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:27.080
 the new de de js z completes our 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:28.970
 range of specific drivers for 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.310
 will be your dj this is the fourth and last 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.510
 unit of the professional series of de js 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.340
 with a model for each situation 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:35.870
 configuration and price from the most 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.850
 small to the greatest all of them 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.590
 offer effortless control as well 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.660
 the latest and most exciting functions 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.580
 What will your dj offer different levels? 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.559
 of portability connectivity and quality 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.470
 of design make this technology be 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:50.120
 accessible to everyone the sb is 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.530
 perfect for beginners with the

 most affordable price and the best 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.250
 portability but able to offer 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.659
 professional results lcr is the 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.610
 next with a faceplate of 

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:00.739
 aluminum 8 patch for direct and 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.729
 control for four dishes the asx has 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:03.379
 the perfect balance between 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:05.269
 portability and control in session without 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.040
 precedents with a built-in mixer 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.590
 to connect it to a professional team 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.630
 finally the sct is the controller 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.549
 most advanced professional to be attoli 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.020
 and that has been waiting for the market with 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:16.850
 10 kilos and just below a large 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.290
 meter hides the vast majority of 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.330
 technological discoveries that 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.340
 incorporate a pack of jacks tc 2000 with 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.840
 one of jm 900 nexus with this 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.090
 family distribution and spaces 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.009
 and a solid controls the function 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.899
 most obvious professional are the cdj dishes 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.369
 with united with central display these 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:32.929
 show the position of the subject that sounds 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:34.880
 along with a countdown in red up 

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:36.380
 the next point that turning them 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.000
 in the best for virtual shooters 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.069
 of the market and unlike others 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.509
 drivers the sc is replica of 

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:43.549
 almost reliable form the point of 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.350
 reproduction of cerrato dj this 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.299
 combined with a touch technology 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.159
 conductive for more efficient control 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:51.409
 of response not to mention the adjustment 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.509
 mechanical pressure makes the sc is 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.909
 perfect to make the jack link and 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:57.709
 scratching the edge of the dish lights up 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.659
 in blue when you work with the dishes 1 

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:01.789
 and 2 and blank when you control the 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.009
 plates 3 and 4 making the 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:05.780
 assignments stop setting wildpitch 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:07.729
 sleep mode and all other controls 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.090
 typical make it the team that 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.739
 would any professional the popular 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.349
 Pad section works exactly like 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:17.390
 the asx with hot cues rawle slider and 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:19.790
 a sensitive speed sampler but 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.620
 with three new hot loop loop safe modes 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.150
 and slideshare loop that mimics the 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.620
 main effects but with a car 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.569
 loop added 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.760
 The bats are the largest 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.319
 spacious market in its distribution and 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.690
 full of possibilities to be 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.580

 in cerato dj now you can 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.840
 categorize the cues with different 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:49.489
 colors for the stopped bits or intros and 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.420
 use the right button to activate

 High quality raiders offer control 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.940
 Start of the plates and heads 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.810
 spilak so they never jump by 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.640
 accident 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.500
 Our best choir magnetic shader is 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.959
 able to withstand up to 10 million 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.569
 operations without losing quality and with 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:19.849
 curve and pressure control equal to 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:22.730
 Our top series of mixers the sct 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:25.220
 sound effects gives you 4 color choose from 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.720

 allowing to select different 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.520
 parameters for the output of me or the 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:46.490
 sampler in each channel and now also in 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.170
 the master output on top of the effects to 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:50.030
 one color the east z has a new

 functions the sc is designed 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.980
 to facilitate the changes between djs 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:14.600
 including two usb connections can be 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.920

 controller what makes it possible to click 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.530
 two djs in back-to-back mode without 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.630
 effort to have both access to all 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.390
 the functions of the mixer when the dj 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.220
 outgoing has disconnected the sz changes 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:30.110
 automatically to the control of the other 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.150
 half to make this happen 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.220
 included two 24-bit sound cards 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.630
 with five stereo outputs the cards 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.160
 they also include five stereo inputs

 integrates with the five stereo outputs 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.629
 of course that the one of js z works like 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:49.400
 midi driver and as a card 

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:51.650
 sound with any music software 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.180
 or for dj with the same options and

 even if two applications are connected 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:58.490
 different from the same pc at a time in 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.440
 As for connections you can mix a 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.810
 total of 4 c of jacks or any other 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.159

 so you do not have to sacrifice 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:15.409
 mixer inputs have the same 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:17.300
 outputs that the sx the master with xl's 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:19.490
 balanced and the series of monitors with 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.860
 balanced jack plus master 2 with 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:23.720
 rca and if that were not enough, we have improved 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.979
 quality with cutting edge technology 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.169
 generation to get ones 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:29.419
 blunt 107 must signal radios 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:31.550
 exit noise the sz uses a 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:33.590
 analog digital audiophile converter 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:36.409
 wow they are like the one we found in the
