would Lance before punches walk Lee

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:03.779 
would Lance before punches walk Lee
would<00:05:02.349> count<00:05:02.620> it<00:05:02.830> was<00:05:02.919> a<00:05:02.949> harder<00:05:03.400> one

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:03.789

and<00:05:04.180> that's<00:05:04.479> why<00:05:04.780> Tommy<00:05:05.199> had<00:05:05.529> to<00:05:05.770> fight<00:05:06.039> the
