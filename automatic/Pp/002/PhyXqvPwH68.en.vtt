00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:13.510 
fun of this show and insult us which it

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.050 
fun of this show and insult us which it
wasn't<00:01:13.750> really<00:01:14.140> offensive<00:01:14.620> to<00:01:14.920> us<00:01:15.310> but<00:01:15.700> just

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
wasn't really offensive to us but just

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.530 
wasn't really offensive to us but just
probably<00:01:16.930> that<00:01:17.260> bandit<00:01:17.850> right<00:01:18.850> now<00:01:19.060> so

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
probably that bandit right now so

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.140 
probably that bandit right now so
probably<00:01:20.380> the<00:01:20.590> best<00:01:20.770> thing<00:01:20.890> for<00:01:21.250> everybody<00:01:21.520> in

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
probably the best thing for everybody in

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.540 
probably the best thing for everybody in
sight<00:01:22.330> yeah<00:01:22.720> with<00:01:23.050> the<00:01:23.200> price<00:01:23.410> rising<00:01:24.100> price

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:24.550 
sight yeah with the price rising price

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:31.710 
sight yeah with the price rising price
of<00:01:24.580> gas<00:01:26.100> it's<00:01:27.100> harder<00:01:27.910> for<00:01:28.060> us<00:01:28.240> to<00:01:30.720> yeah

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
of gas it's harder for us to yeah

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.370 
of gas it's harder for us to yeah
because<00:01:32.050> it's<00:01:32.470> my<00:01:33.100> it's<00:01:33.310> a<00:01:33.520> long<00:01:33.790> drive<00:01:34.570> both

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
because it's my it's a long drive both

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.060 
because it's my it's a long drive both
ways<00:01:35.410> so<00:01:36.240> that<00:01:37.240> also<00:01:37.810> factors<00:01:38.500> into<00:01:38.860> it<00:01:38.980> and

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
ways so that also factors into it and

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.780 
ways so that also factors into it and
it's<00:01:39.190> just<00:01:39.460> best<00:01:39.700> to<00:01:39.880> go<00:01:40.090> ahead<00:01:40.120> and<00:01:40.390> move<00:01:40.540> on

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
it's just best to go ahead and move on

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.140 
it's just best to go ahead and move on
so<00:01:42.790> that's<00:01:43.330> going<00:01:43.570> to<00:01:43.690> be<00:01:43.780> so<00:01:45.120> hope<00:01:46.120> you

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
so that's going to be so hope you

00:01:46.150 --> 00:02:56.059 
so that's going to be so hope you
enjoyed<00:01:46.600> it<00:01:46.810> but<00:01:47.050> I<00:01:47.290> guess<00:01:47.470> you<00:01:47.500> did

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:08.660
