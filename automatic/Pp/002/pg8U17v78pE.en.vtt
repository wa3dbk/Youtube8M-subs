it's a step which is causing a major

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.190 
it's a step which is causing a major
movement<00:00:29.500> to<00:00:30.279> be<00:00:30.670> very<00:00:30.910> very<00:00:31.119> minute<00:00:31.540> so

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.200

possible for me to get more yet but oh

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.859 
possible for me to get more yet but oh
you<00:01:25.619> can<00:01:25.800> try<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.040> so<00:01:26.690> that's<00:01:27.690> definitely

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
you can try it so that's definitely

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.440 
you can try it so that's definitely
that's<00:01:28.530> big<00:01:28.770> point<00:01:29.009> so<00:01:29.550> protection<00:01:30.090> from<00:01:30.330> the

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
that's big point so protection from the

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.249 
that's big point so protection from the
weather<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:30.869> really<00:01:31.080> important<00:01:31.830> yeah

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
weather is really important yeah

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.219 
weather is really important yeah
so<00:01:34.259> I<00:01:34.890> can<00:01:35.460> take<00:01:35.759> my<00:01:35.820> water<00:01:36.540> you<00:01:36.810> can<00:01:36.960> put<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.170> at

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
so I can take my water you can put it at

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.859 
so I can take my water you can put it at
home<00:01:37.380> table<00:01:38.119> you<00:01:39.119> also<00:01:39.300> don't<00:01:39.479> want<00:01:39.660> to<00:01:39.690> take

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
home table you also don't want to take

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:46.580 
home table you also don't want to take
me<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:43.640> so<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:45.630> doesn't<00:01:45.930> matter<00:01:46.050> what<00:01:46.350> time<00:01:46.560> you

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
me to so it doesn't matter what time you

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.430 
me to so it doesn't matter what time you
start<00:01:47.009> with<00:01:47.630> because<00:01:48.630> even<00:01:48.990> one's<00:01:49.140> gonna<00:01:49.259> be

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
start with because even one's gonna be

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.029 
start with because even one's gonna be
just<00:01:49.680> as<00:01:49.830> difficult<00:01:50.240> and<00:01:51.259> then<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.590> idea<00:01:52.950> is

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:53.039 
just as difficult and then the idea is

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:56.809 
just as difficult and then the idea is
to<00:01:53.610> get<00:01:54.479> one<00:01:54.750> arm<00:01:54.929> on<00:01:55.229> completely<00:01:55.830> go<00:01:56.310> as<00:01:56.520> far

00:01:56.809 --> 00:01:56.819 
to get one arm on completely go as far

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:59.450 
to get one arm on completely go as far
up<00:01:57.119> as<00:01:57.240> you<00:01:57.420> can<00:01:57.770> then<00:01:58.770> you're<00:01:58.860> gonna<00:01:58.950> wrap<00:01:59.220> the

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
up as you can then you're gonna wrap the

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.400 
up as you can then you're gonna wrap the
jacket<00:01:59.910> around<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.840> then<00:02:00.960> you're<00:02:01.050> gonna<00:02:01.140> put

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:01.410 
jacket around and then you're gonna put

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:06.149 
jacket around and then you're gonna put
the<00:02:01.530> other<00:02:01.560> arm<00:02:01.770> through

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:18.119 

I<00:02:15.569> can<00:02:16.569> feel<00:02:16.840> that<00:02:16.989> the<00:02:17.140> liner<00:02:17.410> is<00:02:17.739> getting

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
I can feel that the liner is getting

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:31.399 
I can feel that the liner is getting
bunched<00:02:18.430> inside

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:31.409 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:33.839 

and<00:02:32.409> the<00:02:32.590> sweat<00:02:32.860> tends<00:02:33.099> to<00:02:33.250> make<00:02:33.400> moolah

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
and the sweat tends to make moolah

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:36.420 
and the sweat tends to make moolah
sticky<00:02:34.329> so<00:02:35.019> the<00:02:35.200> airliners<00:02:35.829> tend<00:02:36.129> to<00:02:36.220> state

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
sticky so the airliners tend to state

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:45.830 
sticky so the airliners tend to state
community<00:02:36.849> all<00:02:37.030> right

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840
