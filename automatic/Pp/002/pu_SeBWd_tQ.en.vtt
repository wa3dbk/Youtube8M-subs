00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:37.360
 increase dramatically 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.070
 hey witnesses multiply thanks to technology the number of films 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.350
 amateur 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.840
 the media document these incredible episodes, many people wonder 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.190
 what is happening in verse 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.310
 the most organized are the researchers who started a project without 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:00.630
 precedents in the history of modern ufology the sky is studied and 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:06.480
 systematically monitored everything is signed registered hey documented

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:26.000
 genoa 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.950
 and we will try to understand why the researchers define the mexico a 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.950
 real point of contact 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.560
 everything begins with the total solar eclipse that occurred in Mexico on 11 July 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.320
 of 1991 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.510
 which coincides with an ancient Mayan prophecy 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.350
 the prophecy announces that in conjunction with Italy's lisse it would be 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.670
 the encounter of earthly humanity with the lords of the stars began 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.130
 everything is written in the dresda code 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.660
 one of the few documents that escaped the destructive fury of the conquistadores 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:03.950
 Spanish 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.930
 but back to the clicks 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:12.310
 on 11 July 1991, millions of people who followed it 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.679
 spectacular astronomical event 

00:02:14.679 --> 00:02:20.179
 but no one initially seems to notice the presence of an anomalous aircraft that 

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:24.109
 the mexico remains stationary in the sky mentioned above 

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:26.949
 later reviewing the videos 

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:29.579
 many people notice the intruder 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:31.949
 and of apparent naturam italy 

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:33.699
 reflects sunlight 

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:35.899
 and the form is famous 

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:37.449
 looks like it 

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:39.369
 a classic flying saucer 

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:43.219
 book the sighting causes a certain sensation 

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:47.549
 and is especially interested in journalist researchers jaime maussan 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:53.309
 in the days following the eclipse the drafting of mass paintings one of the 

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:57.969
 Major Mexican private television networks are literally submerged 

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:02.259
 from other videos of the mysterious aircraft the curiosity grows 

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:06.400
 what the movie object really is during the eclipse 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.950
 where it comes from it could be a possible confirmation of the mysterious 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:18.180
 Mayan prophecy for demetrio feria one of the historical components of the vigilantes that 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.000
 day and still a megavideo doll is well impressed in the memory via atenea 

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:25.039
 adhesives 

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:29.789
 I already had a camera I wanted to see if the phenomenon was true rossella 

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:31.150
 I'm not a liar 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.140
 film tricks need this genre dendi film yet 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.750
 we spend enough time in the period between June and hours 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:45.179
 I started filming in November at 5 am 

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:51.079
 does not steal you sent roma remembers the euro eclipse well indeed in that 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:51.769
 moment 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:54.769
 who decided to become the ass of others 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:59.459
 apart from the total eclipse of the sun I would not be curious about the eclipse 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:04.159
 total sunshine and of 11 July 1991 absolute make a move do not show up 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:05.159
 on TV

 who said that when they kiss people with theirs 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.059
 cameras had filmed info 

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:14.939
 an important decision to follow the example of those people buys the 

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:18.729
 camera and then over the years I signed flying objects above 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:21.729
 city ​​of mexico during valdelsa news google 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:25.389
 I have you I can do the facebook webmail shopping 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:27.740
 the eclipse event 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:33.080
 it arises to the UFOs as the opening of the mythical Pandora's box begins in this way 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:38.349
 mexico one of the most intense waves of sightings in history certainly the 

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:43.050
 considerable diffusion of cameras home cameras plays in favor of 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.860
 new greater possibility of sightings but actually the number 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.060
 begins to grow exponentially right after the eclipse 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.330
 of 11 July 1991 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.229
 movies from Mexico go around the world 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:04.340
 testing astonishment in people, the unhappiness of scholars took place 

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:08.330
 they were found next to material to be analyzed 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.819
 you have - to hussana the investigator who most had the merit of 

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:18.009
 search to spread the large amount of video material made in Mexico 

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:21.419
 both from casual witnesses and from vigilantes 

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:25.559
 the idea of ​​giving life to this group was also his 

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:32.469
 today to direct coordinating the work of the vigilantes in addition to the khaiman maussan there is 

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:34.809
 the researchers and pedro avila 

00:05:34.809 --> 00:05:39.169
 his footage of unidentified flying objects went around the 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:42.169
 world generating great interest 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:48.580
 free for over 15 years practically lives in his small recluse 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.680
 room due to a highly disabling illness 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:58.169
 nevertheless, from his small world he makes very important contributions to 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:01.169
 worldwide UFO research 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:06.910
 a small window a bit of sky are his only contact with the 

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:11.590
 outside world and he keeps under control from the early hours of the day 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:16.500
 until the night and I'm not mangarush in the taskbar when they are 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.589
 become more delicate than they are 

00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:21.589
 I was forced to stay in my room in action a 

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:26.620
 I imagined evening text I thought that because of what would have decreased 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:30.500
 what I could stop by not having the piceno hypotyposis space say 

00:06:30.499 --> 00:06:32.119
 from garden garden 

00:06:32.119 --> 00:06:37.339

00:06:37.339 --> 00:06:41.169
 this little tango window made the best movies I've ever had 

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:41.770
 obtained 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:45.509
 if the skeleton of robin investigations we know that in the context of 

00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:49.229
 investigation ufo solar system the most common objects are not the spheres 

00:06:49.229 --> 00:06:53.379
 man you can be the only one white 

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:55.409
 can be accepted 

00:06:55.409 --> 00:06:59.629
 may be never i'm blue box rossella site creation different colors
