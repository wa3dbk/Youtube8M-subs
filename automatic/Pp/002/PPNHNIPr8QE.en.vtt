transitional grapples i do not know that
I'm<00:00:07.259> knology<00:00:07.649> now<00:00:07.980> it's<00:00:08.790> basically<00:00:08.940> when<00:00:09.780> your

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
I'm knology now it's basically when your

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.020 
I'm knology now it's basically when your
opponent<00:00:10.500> is<00:00:10.650> a<00:00:10.740> mat<00:00:11.219> and<00:00:11.250> about<00:00:11.639> the<00:00:11.759> get<00:00:11.910> up

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
opponent is a mat and about the get up

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.060 
opponent is a mat and about the get up
normally<00:00:12.929> in<00:00:13.139> previous<00:00:13.500> games<00:00:13.710> you<00:00:13.950> with

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
normally in previous games you with

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.880 
normally in previous games you with
stick<00:00:14.849> them<00:00:15.000> into<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.210> chain<00:00:15.450> grapple<00:00:15.839> if<00:00:16.379> you

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
stick them into a chain grapple if you

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.870 
stick them into a chain grapple if you
get<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.580> timing<00:00:18.330> right<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:19.880> combination

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
get the timing right and combination

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.689 
get the timing right and combination
right<00:00:21.029> you<00:00:21.240> can<00:00:21.420> perform<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.900> move<00:00:22.260> as<00:00:22.699> they're

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
right you can perform a move as they're

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.279 
right you can perform a move as they're
getting<00:00:24.090> up<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.420> it's<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.600> unique<00:00:24.960> move

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
getting up and it's a unique move

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.019 
getting up and it's a unique move
depending<00:00:25.680> on<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.830> position<00:00:25.920> for<00:00:26.609> example

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
depending on the position for example

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.419 
depending on the position for example
when<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.140> getting<00:00:28.439> up<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:28.769> using<00:00:28.890> 2k14

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
when the getting up and using 2k14

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.099 
when the getting up and using 2k14
example<00:00:30.090> because<00:00:30.210> you<00:00:30.330> can't<00:00:30.539> really<00:00:30.630> do<00:00:31.080> it

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
example because you can't really do it

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.830 
example because you can't really do it
in<00:00:31.679> 2k14<00:00:32.930> you<00:00:33.930> can<00:00:34.140> do<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.500> suplex<00:00:35.130> if<00:00:35.520> you

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
in 2k14 you can do a suplex if you

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.049 
in 2k14 you can do a suplex if you
there's<00:00:36.840> also<00:00:37.020> diversity<00:00:37.950> backbreaker<00:00:38.640> there

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
there's also diversity backbreaker there

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.530 
there's also diversity backbreaker there
is<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.629> snap<00:00:39.870> DDT<00:00:40.469> which<00:00:40.710> meniscus<00:00:41.550> I'm<00:00:41.850> same

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
is the snap DDT which meniscus I'm same

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.900 
is the snap DDT which meniscus I'm same
for<00:00:42.809> it's<00:00:43.530> very<00:00:43.800> similar<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.280> this<00:00:44.520> animation

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
for it's very similar to this animation

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.650 
for it's very similar to this animation
but<00:00:45.420> not<00:00:46.230> really<00:00:46.910> there's<00:00:47.910> also<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.360> reverse

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
but not really there's also the reverse

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.389 
but not really there's also the reverse
suplex<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.350> inverted<00:00:49.739> seed<00:00:49.920> plants<00:00:50.190> that<00:00:50.309> you

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
suplex the inverted seed plants that you

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.850 
suplex the inverted seed plants that you
get<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:50.850> there's<00:00:51.809> also<00:00:51.930> like<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.530> knockdown

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
get and there's also like a knockdown

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.770 
get and there's also like a knockdown
sort<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.489> like<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.910> shove<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.329> head<00:00:54.510> into<00:00:54.660> the

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
sort of like to shove the head into the

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.830 
sort of like to shove the head into the
mat<00:00:55.020> sort<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.410> Bulldog<00:00:55.800> style<00:00:56.329> and<00:00:57.329> this<00:00:57.449> awful

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
mat sort of Bulldog style and this awful

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.799 
mat sort of Bulldog style and this awful
grip<00:00:58.109> down<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:58.980> dirty<00:00:59.160> style<00:00:59.550> things<00:00:59.879> but

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
grip down and dirty style things but

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.529 
grip down and dirty style things but
it's<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.079> nice<00:01:01.320> fluid<00:01:02.010> sort<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.820> animation<00:01:03.359> it

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
it's a nice fluid sort of animation it

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.090 
it's a nice fluid sort of animation it
looks<00:01:03.780> very<00:01:05.420> one<00:01:06.420> with<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.780> magic<00:01:07.260> feels<00:01:07.530> but

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
looks very one with the magic feels but

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.969 
looks very one with the magic feels but
it<00:01:08.280> should<00:01:08.549> be<00:01:08.580> there<00:01:09.060> I<00:01:09.590> don't<00:01:10.590> know<00:01:10.710> how<00:01:10.920> the

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
it should be there I don't know how the

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.370 
it should be there I don't know how the
combination<00:01:11.580> works<00:01:11.820> it<00:01:12.090> was<00:01:12.689> pretty<00:01:13.080> random

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
combination works it was pretty random

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.380 
combination works it was pretty random
for<00:01:13.710> me<00:01:13.799> but<00:01:13.950> I<00:01:13.979> wasn't<00:01:14.189> really<00:01:14.430> trying<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.820> do

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
for me but I wasn't really trying to do

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.149 
for me but I wasn't really trying to do
it<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.780> just<00:01:15.990> sort<00:01:16.170> of<00:01:16.350> happened<00:01:16.860> there<00:01:17.009> may<00:01:17.130> be

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
it it just sort of happened there may be

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.580 
it it just sort of happened there may be
a<00:01:17.310> trigger<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:18.090> do<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.540> where<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.140> timing

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
a trigger to do it where the timing

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.730 
a trigger to do it where the timing
based<00:01:19.970> or<00:01:20.970> pressing<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.110> right<00:01:22.200> combination

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
based or pressing the right combination

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.230 
based or pressing the right combination
of<00:01:22.799> buttons<00:01:22.920> maybe<00:01:23.280> it's<00:01:23.430> like<00:01:23.700> down<00:01:23.939> Nathan

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
of buttons maybe it's like down Nathan

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.649 
of buttons maybe it's like down Nathan
stencil<00:01:25.110> down<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.350> next<00:01:25.560> I<00:01:26.240> don't<00:01:27.240> know<00:01:27.390> um

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
stencil down the next I don't know um

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.149 
stencil down the next I don't know um
hopefully<00:01:28.259> when<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:28.560> get<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.799> play<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:28.979> again

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
hopefully when I get to play it again

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.590 
hopefully when I get to play it again
I'll<00:01:29.310> be<00:01:29.430> able<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.610> mix<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.090> match<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.420> ask

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
I'll be able to mix and match and ask

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.890 
I'll be able to mix and match and ask
the<00:01:31.020> developers<00:01:31.770> of<00:01:31.799> it<00:01:32.009> as<00:01:32.100> well<00:01:32.689> do<00:01:33.689> you<00:01:33.750> like

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
the developers of it as well do you like

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.109 
the developers of it as well do you like
the<00:01:34.020> concept<00:01:34.460> also<00:01:35.460> if<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:35.759> get<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:35.939> timing

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
the concept also if you get the timing

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.640 
the concept also if you get the timing
wrong<00:01:36.329> it<00:01:36.509> just<00:01:36.600> means<00:01:36.930> you<00:01:37.049> go<00:01:37.170> put<00:01:37.409> them<00:01:37.530> back

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
wrong it just means you go put them back

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.130 
wrong it just means you go put them back
into<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:38.009> I<00:01:38.220> chain<00:01:39.060> wrap<00:01:39.270> or<00:01:39.540> sometimes<00:01:39.840> into<00:01:40.079> a

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
into it I chain wrap or sometimes into a

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.260 
into it I chain wrap or sometimes into a
rocking<00:01:40.530> rattle<00:01:40.890> just<00:01:41.460> depends<00:01:41.970> what<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.119> is

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
rocking rattle just depends what it is

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.999 
rocking rattle just depends what it is
that's<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.630> reverse<00:01:42.750> suplex<00:01:43.350> amazon<00:01:43.829> about

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
that's the reverse suplex amazon about

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.639 
that's the reverse suplex amazon about
just<00:01:44.220> for<00:01:44.399> people<00:01:44.520> that<00:01:44.759> weren't<00:01:44.939> aware<00:01:45.509> of<00:01:45.649> I

just for people that weren't aware of I

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.940 
just for people that weren't aware of I
like<00:01:47.579> it<00:01:47.869> it<00:01:48.869> does<00:01:49.079> mean<00:01:49.320> you<00:01:49.409> have<00:01:49.590> some<00:01:49.799> more
