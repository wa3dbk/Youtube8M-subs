higher<00:03:42.299> survivability<00:03:42.989> rate<00:03:43.349> which<00:03:44.010> will

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
higher survivability rate which will

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.530 
higher survivability rate which will
help<00:03:44.310> you<00:03:44.430> in<00:03:44.489> the<00:03:44.609> long<00:03:44.639> run<00:03:44.819> especially<00:03:45.120> in

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
help you in the long run especially in

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.849 
help you in the long run especially in
dungeons<00:03:46.489> now<00:03:47.489> this<00:03:47.669> bill<00:03:47.879> can<00:03:48.060> also<00:03:48.299> be<00:03:48.720> used

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:48.859 
dungeons now this bill can also be used

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:52.159 
dungeons now this bill can also be used
during<00:03:49.859> PvE<00:03:50.370> but<00:03:51.359> in<00:03:51.449> order<00:03:51.629> to<00:03:51.750> do<00:03:51.930> that<00:03:52.109> I

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:52.169 
during PvE but in order to do that I

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:53.839 
during PvE but in order to do that I
would<00:03:52.440> definitely<00:03:52.590> change<00:03:52.980> up<00:03:53.220> some<00:03:53.609> of<00:03:53.760> these

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:53.849 
would definitely change up some of these

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:56.300 
would definitely change up some of these
skills<00:03:54.629> over<00:03:54.870> here<00:03:55.049> for<00:03:55.530> instance<00:03:56.010> i<00:03:56.190> would

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
skills over here for instance i would

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.159 
skills over here for instance i would
change<00:03:56.459> healing<00:03:56.879> signet<00:03:57.389> to<00:03:57.569> healing<00:03:57.900> surge

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:58.169 
change healing signet to healing surge

00:03:58.169 --> 00:03:59.720 
change healing signet to healing surge
just<00:03:58.919> because<00:03:59.129> it<00:03:59.220> gives<00:03:59.280> you<00:03:59.400> a<00:03:59.430> little<00:03:59.549> bit

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
just because it gives you a little bit

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.430 
just because it gives you a little bit
more<00:03:59.879> heel<00:04:00.209> power<00:04:00.510> especially<00:04:00.810> once<00:04:01.230> you<00:04:01.290> get

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
more heel power especially once you get

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.069 
more heel power especially once you get
your<00:04:01.560> gelatin<00:04:01.859> built<00:04:02.099> out<00:04:02.250> I<00:04:03.239> shake<00:04:03.870> it<00:04:03.900> off

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
your gelatin built out I shake it off

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:06.110 
your gelatin built out I shake it off
I'd<00:04:04.379> probably<00:04:04.590> still<00:04:04.919> don't<00:04:05.220> know<00:04:05.400> shake<00:04:06.090> it

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
I'd probably still don't know shake it

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.849 
I'd probably still don't know shake it
off<00:04:06.269> I<00:04:06.419> would<00:04:06.540> change<00:04:06.750> to<00:04:07.049> probably<00:04:07.379> cigna

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:07.859 
off I would change to probably cigna

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:09.110 
off I would change to probably cigna
might<00:04:08.129> just<00:04:08.549> because<00:04:08.790> they'll<00:04:08.910> give<00:04:09.030> you<00:04:09.090> a

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
might just because they'll give you a

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.349 
might just because they'll give you a
little<00:04:09.209> bit<00:04:09.359> more<00:04:09.510> extra<00:04:09.840> damage<00:04:11.180> so<00:04:12.180> for

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
little bit more extra damage so for

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:13.699 
little bit more extra damage so for
great<00:04:12.510> justice<00:04:12.540> is<00:04:12.959> a<00:04:12.989> great<00:04:13.169> one<00:04:13.290> have<00:04:13.530> on

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
great justice is a great one have on

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.860 
great justice is a great one have on
anyway<00:04:14.099> just<00:04:15.030> because<00:04:15.150> it<00:04:15.419> increases<00:04:15.599> your

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
anyway just because it increases your

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.089 
anyway just because it increases your
cred<00:04:16.049> chances<00:04:16.440> and<00:04:16.590> gives<00:04:16.709> you<00:04:16.799> a<00:04:16.829> little<00:04:16.949> bit

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:17.099 
cred chances and gives you a little bit

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:20.060 
cred chances and gives you a little bit
more<00:04:17.220> power<00:04:17.459> to<00:04:18.260> obviously<00:04:19.260> with<00:04:19.530> with

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
more power to obviously with with

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.099 
more power to obviously with with
soloing<00:04:20.849> a<00:04:20.910> PVE<00:04:21.209> don't<00:04:21.599> really<00:04:21.840> want<00:04:21.959> to<00:04:22.019> use

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
soloing a PVE don't really want to use

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.740 
soloing a PVE don't really want to use
banners<00:04:22.469> too<00:04:22.680> much<00:04:22.860> so<00:04:23.669> I<00:04:23.700> probably<00:04:24.150> go<00:04:24.419> with

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
banners too much so I probably go with

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.990 
banners too much so I probably go with
signal<00:04:25.740> fearing<00:04:26.039> just<00:04:26.280> improve<00:04:26.610> your<00:04:26.700> percent

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
signal fearing just improve your percent

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.450 
signal fearing just improve your percent
it<00:04:27.060> and<00:04:27.560> Cigna<00:04:28.560> braised<00:04:28.770> I<00:04:28.950> always<00:04:29.160> keep<00:04:29.310> on

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
it and Cigna braised I always keep on

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:30.770 
it and Cigna braised I always keep on
anyway<00:04:29.760> just<00:04:29.880> because<00:04:30.030> I<00:04:30.300> like<00:04:30.420> having<00:04:30.690> that

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
anyway just because I like having that

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.240 
anyway just because I like having that
extra<00:04:30.840> swiftness<00:04:31.440> and<00:04:31.650> fury<00:04:31.920> and<00:04:32.040> might

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
extra swiftness and fury and might

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.190 
extra swiftness and fury and might
especially<00:04:32.790> the<00:04:33.090> swiftness<00:04:33.630> because<00:04:33.990> I<00:04:34.050> like

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
especially the swiftness because I like

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.570 
especially the swiftness because I like
to<00:04:34.230> be<00:04:34.350> able<00:04:34.410> to<00:04:34.530> get<00:04:34.620> around<00:04:34.710> faster<00:04:35.370> so

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
to be able to get around faster so

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.280 
to be able to get around faster so
activating<00:04:36.420> that<00:04:36.540> and<00:04:36.780> getting<00:04:36.960> the<00:04:37.110> extra

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
activating that and getting the extra

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.160 
activating that and getting the extra
swiftness<00:04:37.650> is<00:04:37.890> very<00:04:38.040> useful<00:04:38.430> during<00:04:38.550> PVE<00:04:39.170> but

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.170 
swiftness is very useful during PVE but

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:41.510 
swiftness is very useful during PVE but
that's<00:04:40.290> pretty<00:04:40.410> much<00:04:40.530> it<00:04:40.650> guys<00:04:40.860> I<00:04:41.280> mean<00:04:41.430> this
