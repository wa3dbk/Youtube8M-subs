the<00:00:53.840> auto<00:00:54.110> transmission<00:00:54.559> the<00:00:55.370> turbo<00:00:55.820> the

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
the auto transmission the turbo the

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.220 
the auto transmission the turbo the
manifold<00:00:57.140> the<00:00:57.800> injectors<00:00:58.370> or<00:00:58.780> a<00:00:59.780> lot<00:00:59.989> of<00:01:00.020> stuff

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
manifold the injectors or a lot of stuff

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:01.600 
manifold the injectors or a lot of stuff
I<00:01:00.350> shouldn't<00:01:00.620> tell<00:01:00.829> you<00:01:00.890> guys<00:01:01.100> that<00:01:01.340> but<00:01:01.579> uh

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
but yeah I'm getting an R 154 I'm

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.690 
but yeah I'm getting an R 154 I'm
getting<00:01:05.000> a<00:01:05.210> BorgWarner<00:01:06.020> s<00:01:06.200> 366<00:01:07.070> turbo<00:01:07.490> it's

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
getting a BorgWarner s 366 turbo it's

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.040 
getting a BorgWarner s 366 turbo it's
gonna<00:01:07.820> be<00:01:07.970> a<00:01:08.030> big<00:01:08.180> 66<00:01:08.840> millimeter<00:01:09.320> turbo<00:01:11.050> I'm

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.050 
gonna be a big 66 millimeter turbo I'm

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.300 
gonna be a big 66 millimeter turbo I'm
getting<00:01:12.259> some<00:01:12.410> bigger<00:01:12.560> injectors<00:01:12.740> I'm<00:01:13.190> not

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
getting some bigger injectors I'm not

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:14.499 
getting some bigger injectors I'm not
sure<00:01:13.490> what<00:01:13.640> size<00:01:13.790> that<00:01:14.030> but<00:01:14.180> I'm<00:01:14.240> thinking

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
sure what size that but I'm thinking

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:18.640 
sure what size that but I'm thinking
about<00:01:14.540> probably<00:01:15.200> 720<00:01:16.000> CC<00:01:17.020> injectors<00:01:18.020> and<00:01:18.290> then

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
about probably 720 CC injectors and then

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.330 
about probably 720 CC injectors and then
the<00:01:19.610> manifold<00:01:20.060> is<00:01:20.149> gonna<00:01:20.300> be<00:01:20.479> gone<00:01:21.160> and<00:01:22.160> I'm

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
the manifold is gonna be gone and I'm

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.950 
the manifold is gonna be gone and I'm
not<00:01:22.520> going<00:01:22.670> to<00:01:22.729> lease<00:01:23.030> to<00:01:23.060> you<00:01:23.360> either<00:01:23.539> because

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
not going to lease to you either because

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.010 
not going to lease to you either because
I'm<00:01:24.110> gonna<00:01:24.229> be<00:01:24.350> getting<00:01:24.590> a<00:01:24.680> standalone<00:01:25.100> for<00:01:25.490> it

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
I'm gonna be getting a standalone for it

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.930 
I'm gonna be getting a standalone for it
so<00:01:27.020> yeah<00:01:27.229> so<00:01:27.680> basically<00:01:28.039> this<00:01:28.369> video<00:01:28.700> I'm

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
all right guys so what you just saw in

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.820 
all right guys so what you just saw in
that<00:02:18.970> like<00:02:19.450> last<00:02:19.780> I<00:02:20.260> don't<00:02:20.319> even<00:02:20.500> know<00:02:20.709> how

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
that like last I don't even know how

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.280 
that like last I don't even know how
many<00:02:20.890> seconds<00:02:21.630> I've<00:02:22.630> been<00:02:22.959> spending<00:02:23.170> the

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
many seconds I've been spending the

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.229 
many seconds I've been spending the
 hours<00:02:24.010> trying<00:02:24.220> to<00:02:24.250> get<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:24.489> stock

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
 hours trying to get the stock

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.690 
 hours trying to get the stock
wiring<00:02:25.480> harness<00:02:26.050> off<00:02:26.230> and<00:02:26.610> it's<00:02:27.610> like

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
wiring harness off and it's like

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.150 
wiring harness off and it's like
impossible<00:02:28.000> to<00:02:28.599> get<00:02:28.810> it<00:02:28.900> off<00:02:29.050> unless<00:02:29.349> you<00:02:29.410> take

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
impossible to get it off unless you take

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.580 
impossible to get it off unless you take
off<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.520> intake<00:02:31.150> manifold<00:02:31.660> right<00:02:31.840> here<00:02:32.050> so

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
off the intake manifold right here so

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:33.809 
off the intake manifold right here so
that's<00:02:32.830> what<00:02:32.920> I<00:02:32.980> just<00:02:33.010> did<00:02:33.190> I<00:02:33.310> just<00:02:33.550> took<00:02:33.670> off

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
that's what I just did I just took off

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:35.460 
that's what I just did I just took off
the<00:02:33.849> intake<00:02:34.269> manifold<00:02:34.780> and<00:02:35.050> I<00:02:35.110> was<00:02:35.230> able<00:02:35.319> to

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
the intake manifold and I was able to

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.990 
the intake manifold and I was able to
finally<00:02:35.890> get<00:02:36.040> the<00:02:36.220> harness<00:02:36.760> out<00:02:37.140> so<00:02:38.730> so<00:02:39.730> next

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
finally get the harness out so so next

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.680 
finally get the harness out so so next
I'm<00:02:40.420> going<00:02:40.810> to<00:02:42.000> I'm<00:02:43.000> gonna<00:02:43.150> start<00:02:43.300> working<00:02:43.450> on

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
I'm going to I'm gonna start working on

00:02:43.690 --> 00:03:42.780 
I'm going to I'm gonna start working on
this<00:02:43.810> turbo<00:02:44.260> I<00:02:44.290> believe<00:02:45.690> so<00:02:46.690> yeah

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.090 

the<00:03:43.420> whole<00:03:43.600> entire<00:03:43.870> manifolds<00:03:44.590> gonna<00:03:44.770> be<00:03:44.920> off

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
the whole entire manifolds gonna be off

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.880 
the whole entire manifolds gonna be off
too<00:03:45.430> so<00:03:45.819> the<00:03:46.780> smart<00:03:47.080> thing<00:03:47.230> to<00:03:47.260> do<00:03:47.440> would<00:03:47.830> just

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
too so the smart thing to do would just

00:03:47.890 --> 00:04:21.740 
too so the smart thing to do would just
be<00:03:48.220> just<00:03:49.180> remove<00:03:49.510> the<00:03:49.600> whole<00:03:49.720> entire<00:03:49.930> manifold

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.880 

all<00:04:22.750> right<00:04:22.870> guys<00:04:23.050> I<00:04:23.110> gotta<00:04:23.290> make<00:04:23.440> this<00:04:23.590> quick
