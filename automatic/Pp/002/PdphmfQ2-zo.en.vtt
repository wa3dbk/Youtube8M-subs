foundation<00:01:52.320> but<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.880> usually<00:01:53.880> just<00:01:54.329> put<00:01:54.600> like

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
foundation but I usually just put like

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.990 
foundation but I usually just put like
one<00:01:55.200> code<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:56.040> then<00:01:56.219> I<00:01:56.399> just<00:01:56.670> put<00:01:56.969> up

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
one code and then I just put up

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.530 
one code and then I just put up
concealer<00:01:57.810> but<00:01:58.799> today<00:01:59.369> for<00:01:59.850> that<00:02:00.119> I'm<00:02:00.390> going

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
concealer but today for that I'm going

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.719 
concealer but today for that I'm going
to<00:02:00.600> be<00:02:00.689> using<00:02:01.200> my<00:02:01.500> Beauty<00:02:02.100> Blender<00:02:02.130> just

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
to be using my Beauty Blender just

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.200 
to be using my Beauty Blender just
because<00:02:03.090> it's<00:02:03.270> such<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.479> thick<00:02:03.899> consistency

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
because it's such a thick consistency

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.719 
because it's such a thick consistency
that<00:02:06.210> I<00:02:06.270> just<00:02:06.710> think<00:02:07.710> that<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.099> goes<00:02:08.310> better

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
that I just think that it goes better

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.210 
that I just think that it goes better
with<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:09.239> sponge<00:02:09.629> because<00:02:09.810> I<00:02:10.259> have<00:02:10.590> tried<00:02:11.009> it

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
with the sponge because I have tried it

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.400 
with the sponge because I have tried it
with

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
with

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.070 
with
brush<00:02:12.800> and<00:02:13.160> it<00:02:13.370> just<00:02:13.580> looks<00:02:13.880> very<00:02:14.080> streaky

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
brush and it just looks very streaky

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.810 
brush and it just looks very streaky
because<00:02:15.470> it's<00:02:15.650> like<00:02:15.860> I<00:02:15.950> said<00:02:16.160> it's<00:02:16.310> so<00:02:16.490> thick

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
because it's like I said it's so thick

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.240 
because it's like I said it's so thick
it's<00:02:17.000> thicker<00:02:17.300> than<00:02:17.420> the<00:02:17.860> Revlon<00:02:18.860> Colorstay
