00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.800
 Welcome to this workshop I will make a prompt to flatten the wood, well if you 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.200
 Do not give you such a tool like me 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.500
 This solution can be a great solution for you! Lets start! 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.330
 I began cutting the wood pieces to 60 in 40 cm to match the size 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.730
 Aluminum tubes. 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.480
 This 6 mm of glass plate length 50 cm 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.780
 So the maximum width that can be crossed side by side on the rails 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.960
 Is 24.5 centimeters. 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.880
 Now I am fixing the holes for the screws to be reached 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.990
 Pipe with a surface of a piece of wood. 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.380
 Slots were fixed on the piece of wood to make sure everything was going well. 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.540
 I pierced the openings vertically and placed the nails with loops and nuts. 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.490
 To prevent the glass plate from bending, you connect some aluminum angles. 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.000
 Cut to match the sizes and ends trimmed to remove the appendages. 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.780
 You put all corners to make sure. 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.100
 The equipment was by 16 nails. 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.340
 The points were identified by a drill. 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:21.430
 I trimmed the rest of the pieces and softened them to remove the scratches 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.970
 To give it the appearance of the nicest, softest and most beautiful. 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.100
 You do not have to do the smoothing, just do it to improve the look. 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.560
 The holes were identified on the glass. 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:46.920
 The drill has a smaller diameter than the screw 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.440
 So make it easier for you to puncture the glass. 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.330
 It is important that you drill very slowly when using the drill. 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.689
 I removed the paper from the glass in both directions so that I could fix everything carefully 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:07.829
 Using a screwdriver to avoid any cracks. 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.680
 I removed the plate from my router so that I could move the holes into the glass. 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:48.080
 The foreground was identified using a white pen because the holes were not identical. 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.420
 Then create the center point of the glass by specifying the diameter 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.920
 Then make sure that all distances are equal. 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.240
 You weight the lines 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.140
 I matched it with the wave plate. 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.600
 The four points were then moved to an outside sheet 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.930
 I connected the dots to find the center area of ​​the wave plate. 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.320
 I made an intersection with the two main points and then placed the wave plate along 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.620
 With those four previous points. Here is the area for suitable hole holes. 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.580
 It is not important to put the wave in the middle completely 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.880
 Click the drill but I like to keep things consistent in all cases. 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.740
 I have pierced and pierced the plate to widen the hole until the nails are equal with the surface. 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.740
 I quickly tested the wave and noticed that there were some scratches on the glass, 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.640
 So I stuck two sticks of wood with a double adhesive tape on the roof of the rails. 

00:05:34.559 --> 00:05:39.219
 I took some smearing using sandpaper and put some beeswax paste 

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:55.640
 I installed everything and inserted a small 2 mm nail to determine the center of the wave 

00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:00.380
 On the glass, and like what you see now everything is set correctly. 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.160
 It is also used as a forecaster. 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.800
 You have to drill very slowly and put some lubrication, 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.620
 Otherwise it is possible to break glass. 

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.040
 Now is the time for experimentation! 

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:24.080
 I had to raise the base because the wave could not reach the surface properly. 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:30.170
 The plank arrived with a double adhesive tape and some paper fillings to make it balanced. 

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:36.590
 Do not forget to use air cleaner, glasses and earplug when you work with instruments that cause loud sounds, small pieces of air, or dust in the air! 

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:48.580
 The surface is rough because the wood used is not in the desired shape and soft wood 

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:52.360
 The thinness of some thing and the wood surface is not even equal 

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:57.840
 Now you can flip the piece and work on the other side. 

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:30.710
 If you have any questions, please refer to the comments below 

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:31.850
 Thanks for watching.
