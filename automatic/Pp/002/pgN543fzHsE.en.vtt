00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.600
 par 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:27.060
 Start from the middle position of switching, let's make a big progress and turn your feet 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:28.810
 It is the point that we extend slowly while saying not only extending but cutting the explanation 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:36.670
 is 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:42.180
 Let's draw a round smooth turn arc to keep in contact clothes only with snow 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:42.180
 This technology is often used when using banks 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:07.180
 Kelp changed slope continuously 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:08.290
 Ups and downs is the violent situation in the longitudinal direction of the foot in order to respond to these irregularities 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.380
 Bend and stretch 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:15.020
 Practice with the dough 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:22.759
 Let's start from the middle designation of switching 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:29.400
 The can and thigh a turn so as to push the sustenance explained in both feet while riding to the deviation of the key 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:34.700
 It is important to firmly raise and capture the explanation in the high back position. 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.700
 We use a lot when passing deep place of kelp 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.320
 The 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:44.960
 7 a 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:48.040
 Do not show and sleep 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:55.300
 It is a slip of the technical final 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:02:02.440
 It is a slide that has made the foot greatly progress in the vertical and horizontal direction according to the shape of the red kelp 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:04.810
 As in the case of the previous bridge, it is possible to capture the explanation for a long time by being aware of the movement above and below the stop 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:13.680
 It will be possible 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:13.680
 Keep your eyes and condition under the slope and stabilize in order to move the legs greatly 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.850
 A little 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:23.970
 dee 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:30.720
 It is not an image of absorbing kelp from myself 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:33.890
 It is absorbed naturally by having an image that matches the back of the kelp by switching positions. 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:41.760
 I'm slipping in the image of 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:49.549
 The stable switching is his in Kyushu operation that the state is blurred back and forth 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:49.549
 Practice to keep stable position under any circumstances 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.510
 Four 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:03.430
 th 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:06.410
 Position of the upper body is fixed so as much as possible not to move the top and bottom of the star in accordance with the shape of the kelp 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:11.000
 It slips through the bending and stretching 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:14.960
 Press the skis for explanation firmly while stretching legs 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:22.610
 I will try to catch the backlash from kelp 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:24.850
 Stable slip in my by absorbing Rebun of pressure while bending this time the foot is possible and will 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.850
 I will
