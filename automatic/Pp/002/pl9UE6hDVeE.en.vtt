that they come out with for Christmas
I'm<00:01:03.470> pretty<00:01:04.470> positive<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:05.040> this<00:01:05.280> is<00:01:05.339> Gaetti

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
I'm pretty positive that this is Gaetti

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.240 
I'm pretty positive that this is Gaetti
