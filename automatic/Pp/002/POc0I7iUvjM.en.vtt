this<00:01:59.399> in<00:01:59.579> a<00:01:59.670> little<00:01:59.820> package<00:02:00.299> it<00:02:01.110> doesn't<00:02:01.619> say

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
this in a little package it doesn't say

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.010 
this in a little package it doesn't say
what<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.729> color<00:02:02.969> is<00:02:03.590> so<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:04.619> guess<00:02:04.950> it<00:02:05.159> just<00:02:06.020> you

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
what the color is so I guess it just you

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.040 
what the color is so I guess it just you
just<00:02:07.140> take<00:02:07.350> it<00:02:07.380> out<00:02:07.619> like<00:02:08.190> so<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:09.539> color<00:02:09.780> names

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
just take it out like so the color names

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.750 
just take it out like so the color names
are<00:02:10.259> on<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.470> back<00:02:10.649> so<00:02:11.160> they're<00:02:11.340> not<00:02:11.430> on<00:02:11.610> the

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
are on the back so they're not on the

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.949 
are on the back so they're not on the
package

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959
