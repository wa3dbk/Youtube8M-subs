the game speed here and the way it's

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.710 
the game speed here and the way it's
impacted<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.850> running<00:00:21.180> game<00:00:21.300> either<00:00:21.420> last

year<00:00:22.050> I<00:00:22.080> thought<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.470> game<00:00:22.619> was<00:00:22.769> way<00:00:23.010> too<00:00:23.070> fast

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
year I thought the game was way too fast

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.540 
year I thought the game was way too fast
really<00:00:24.330> detrimental<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.920> ground<00:00:26.220> game

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
really detrimental to the ground game

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.450 
really detrimental to the ground game
but<00:00:27.150> with<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.480> slower<00:00:27.810> gameplay<00:00:28.590> speed<00:00:29.039> this

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
but with the slower gameplay speed this

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.099 
but with the slower gameplay speed this
year<00:00:29.820> I<00:00:30.000> want<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.300> show<00:00:30.539> you<00:00:30.599> some<00:00:30.929> of<00:00:30.960> the

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
year I want to show you some of the

things that can happen to me make it a

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.040 
things that can happen to me make it a
lot<00:00:33.390> better

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
lot better

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.350

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
it's Wayne Allen here is able to come

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.440 
it's Wayne Allen here is able to come
back<00:00:38.430> across<00:00:39.290> help<00:00:40.290> set<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.559> block<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:41.550> also

back across help set a block it also

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.959 
back across help set a block it also
allows<00:00:42.930> my<00:00:43.260> linemen<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.829> go<00:00:44.070> out<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.520> make

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
allows my linemen to go out and make

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.729 
allows my linemen to go out and make
more<00:00:45.210> intelligent<00:00:45.480> decisions<00:00:45.809> because<00:00:46.559> the

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
more intelligent decisions because the

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.220 
more intelligent decisions because the
game<00:00:46.950> is<00:00:47.129> slower<00:00:47.600> reactions<00:00:48.600> are<00:00:48.719> slower<00:00:49.020> on

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
game is slower reactions are slower on

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.100 
game is slower reactions are slower on
the<00:00:49.260> defensive<00:00:49.860> side<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.550> can<00:00:50.760> have<00:00:51.000> you<00:00:51.989> know

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
the defensive side you can have you know

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.529 
the defensive side you can have you know
J<00:00:52.440> come<00:00:52.800> out<00:00:52.920> here<00:00:53.280> assess<00:00:53.910> where<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.270> block

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
J come out here assess where to block

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.360 
J come out here assess where to block
don't<00:00:55.110> find<00:00:55.440> someone<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:55.860> block<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.280> this

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
don't find someone to block and this

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.369 
don't find someone to block and this
really<00:00:56.670> creates<00:00:56.910> this<00:00:57.300> Lane<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:57.840> mean<00:00:58.170> if<00:00:58.260> you

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
really creates this Lane I mean if you

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.740 
really creates this Lane I mean if you
look<00:00:58.530> at<00:00:58.649> Allen<00:00:59.039> if<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.430> look<00:00:59.640> at<00:00:59.760> Jake<00:01:00.000> if<00:01:00.239> you

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
look at Allen if you look at Jake if you

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.930 
look at Allen if you look at Jake if you
look<00:01:00.899> at<00:01:01.020> Anthony<00:01:01.170> Costanzo<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:02.489> is<00:01:02.699> this

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
look at Anthony Costanzo that is this

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.030 
look at Anthony Costanzo that is this
Lane<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.840> reason<00:01:04.260> this<00:01:04.379> Lane<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:04.769> here

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
Lane and the reason this Lane is here

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.830 
Lane and the reason this Lane is here
where<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:05.400> would<00:01:05.519> not<00:01:05.670> have<00:01:05.880> been<00:01:06.030> last<00:01:06.510> year

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
where it would not have been last year

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.080 
where it would not have been last year
is<00:01:06.990> because<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.710> game<00:01:07.920> speed<00:01:08.340> is<00:01:08.460> slowed<00:01:08.820> down

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
is because the game speed is slowed down

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.539 
is because the game speed is slowed down
and<00:01:09.420> obviously<00:01:10.229> there's<00:01:10.830> still<00:01:10.950> some<00:01:11.280> issues

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
and obviously there's still some issues

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.850 
and obviously there's still some issues
here<00:01:11.790> you<00:01:12.360> know<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.630> have<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.869> problem<00:01:13.170> with<00:01:13.710> the

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
here you know I have a problem with the

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.620 
here you know I have a problem with the
fact<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.220> Ogletree<00:01:14.790> can't<00:01:15.150> kind<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.479> reach

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
fact that Ogletree can't kind of reach

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.289 
fact that Ogletree can't kind of reach
across<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.350> try<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.100> impact<00:01:17.520> this<00:01:17.700> play<00:01:18.060> you

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
across and try to impact this play you

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.780 
across and try to impact this play you
know<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:18.900> can<00:01:19.140> see<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.470> avoidance<00:01:19.979> seems<00:01:20.640> to

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
know you can see the avoidance seems to

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.340 
know you can see the avoidance seems to
be<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:20.909> little<00:01:21.119> bit<00:01:21.270> better<00:01:21.450> whereas<00:01:21.780> before<00:01:22.140> I

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
be a little bit better whereas before I

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.200 
be a little bit better whereas before I
might<00:01:22.710> not<00:01:22.860> have<00:01:22.979> had<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.100> control<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:24.090> get

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
might not have had the control to get

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.289 
might not have had the control to get
around<00:01:24.479> my<00:01:25.200> linemen<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.860> obviously<00:01:26.549> you<00:01:27.180> know

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
around my linemen and obviously you know

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.420 
around my linemen and obviously you know
the<00:01:27.420> tackling<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.530> know<00:01:28.619> people<00:01:28.979> have

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
the tackling I you know people have

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.010 
the tackling I you know people have
talked<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.939> lot<00:01:30.030> about<00:01:30.180> whether<00:01:30.479> it's<00:01:30.659> improved

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
talked a lot about whether it's improved

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.109 
talked a lot about whether it's improved
or<00:01:31.110> not<00:01:31.170> I<00:01:31.380> really<00:01:31.619> don't<00:01:31.799> see<00:01:31.970> maybe<00:01:32.970> a

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
or not I really don't see maybe a

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.450 
or not I really don't see maybe a
fundamental<00:01:33.869> improvement<00:01:34.500> in<00:01:34.590> tackling<00:01:35.040> you

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
fundamental improvement in tackling you

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.249 
fundamental improvement in tackling you
know<00:01:35.549> I<00:01:35.579> see<00:01:35.880> definitely<00:01:36.090> more<00:01:36.570> controlled

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
know I see definitely more controlled

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.890 
know I see definitely more controlled
tackle<00:01:38.159> animations<00:01:38.880> but<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:39.479> don't<00:01:39.659> have

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
tackle animations but you don't have

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.109 
tackle animations but you don't have
those<00:01:40.140> players<00:01:40.470> you<00:01:40.860> know<00:01:41.040> randomly<00:01:41.909> just

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
those players you know randomly just

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.330 
those players you know randomly just
falling<00:01:42.600> over<00:01:42.720> after<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.259> play<00:01:43.500> as<00:01:43.740> much<00:01:44.070> as

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
falling over after the play as much as

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.910 
falling over after the play as much as
you<00:01:44.939> used<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.270> have<00:01:45.450> last<00:01:45.720> year<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.320> just<00:01:46.770> one

tackling<00:01:59.430> especially<00:02:00.030> here<00:02:00.420> it's<00:02:00.930> something

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
tackling especially here it's something

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.350

the<00:02:01.439> really<00:02:01.649> paramount<00:02:02.009> I<00:02:02.310> mean<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:02.729> feel<00:02:03.299> like

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
the really paramount I mean I feel like

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.819 
the really paramount I mean I feel like
if<00:02:03.659> there<00:02:03.810> was<00:02:03.930> an<00:02:04.020> effort<00:02:04.200> there<00:02:04.530> if<00:02:04.680> there

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
if there was an effort there if there

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.399 
if there was an effort there if there
was<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.009> little<00:02:05.850> bit<00:02:06.000> more<00:02:06.180> acceleration<00:02:06.540> you

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
was a little bit more acceleration you

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.979 
was a little bit more acceleration you
know<00:02:07.530> especially<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:08.129> smaller<00:02:08.729> back<00:02:09.090> although

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
know especially a smaller back although

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.780 
know especially a smaller back although
Frank<00:02:10.410> Hoover<00:02:10.619> is<00:02:10.739> not<00:02:10.920> a<00:02:10.950> small<00:02:11.280> back<00:02:11.520> but

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
Frank Hoover is not a small back but

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.580 
Frank Hoover is not a small back but
compared<00:02:12.120> to<00:02:12.180> Ogletree<00:02:12.690> certainly

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
is not as large I feel like he would

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.180 
is not as large I feel like he would
