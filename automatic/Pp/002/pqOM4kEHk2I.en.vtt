00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
to give the cardstock a quarter turn and

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.800 
to give the cardstock a quarter turn and
line<00:02:03.290> it<00:02:03.320> up<00:02:03.530> again<00:02:03.890> at<00:02:04.070> four<00:02:04.370> inches<00:02:04.580> and<00:02:05.180> then

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
line it up again at four inches and then

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.900 
line it up again at four inches and then
I<00:02:05.840> want<00:02:06.200> to<00:02:06.260> make<00:02:06.530> a<00:02:06.560> cut<00:02:06.920> from<00:02:07.220> that<00:02:07.280> score

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
I want to make a cut from that score

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.150 
I want to make a cut from that score
line<00:02:07.940> straight<00:02:08.840> up<00:02:09.080> to<00:02:09.350> the<00:02:09.470> edge<00:02:09.590> of<00:02:09.800> the<00:02:09.920> card

there<00:02:13.000> are<00:02:13.120> two<00:02:13.269> different<00:02:13.780> ways<00:02:13.900> that<00:02:14.140> you

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
there are two different ways that you

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.140 
there are two different ways that you

better<00:02:19.450> for<00:02:19.780> your<00:02:19.930> card<00:02:20.230> to<00:02:20.980> have<00:02:21.159> the<00:02:21.340> panels

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
better for your card to have the panels

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
card your score lines will be made from

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:29.100

the outside corners down to the point

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.860 
the outside corners down to the point
where<00:02:29.379> the<00:02:29.500> score<00:02:29.980> line<00:02:30.250> and<00:02:30.549> cut<00:02:30.970> line<00:02:31.330> meet

where the score line and cut line meet

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.199 
where the score line and cut line meet
and<00:02:32.260> then<00:02:32.920> you'll<00:02:33.069> make<00:02:33.220> that<00:02:33.430> same<00:02:33.790> score

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
and then you'll make that same score

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.830 
and then you'll make that same score
line<00:02:34.420> on<00:02:34.599> both<00:02:34.780> sides<00:02:36.150> if<00:02:37.150> you're<00:02:37.450> working<00:02:37.660> on

line on both sides if you're working on

line on both sides if you're working on
a<00:02:37.900> score<00:02:38.470> pal<00:02:38.829> or<00:02:39.310> another<00:02:39.519> scoreboard<00:02:40.239> it's

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
a score pal or another scoreboard it's

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.259 
a score pal or another scoreboard it's
easy<00:02:41.440> since<00:02:41.739> this<00:02:41.890> is<00:02:42.040> a<00:02:42.069> square<00:02:42.310> to<00:02:42.819> line<00:02:43.060> up

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
easy since this is a square to line up

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:45.750 
easy since this is a square to line up
the<00:02:43.480> opposite<00:02:44.110> points<00:02:44.650> on<00:02:44.860> the<00:02:45.160> score<00:02:45.519> line

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
the opposite points on the score line

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.210 
the opposite points on the score line
and<00:02:46.060> then<00:02:46.810> just<00:02:47.049> make<00:02:47.290> score<00:02:47.680> line<00:02:47.890> from<00:02:48.069> the

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
and then just make score line from the

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.640 
and then just make score line from the
corner<00:02:48.549> down<00:02:48.700> to<00:02:48.760> the<00:02:49.090> center<00:02:49.510> there<00:02:49.750> so<00:02:49.989> those

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
corner down to the center there so those

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.800 
corner down to the center there so those
scored<00:02:50.950> lines<00:02:51.250> allow<00:02:51.609> your<00:02:51.849> front<00:02:52.150> panels<00:02:52.599> to

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
scored lines allow your front panels to

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.630 
scored lines allow your front panels to
face<00:02:53.049> toward<00:02:53.500> each<00:02:53.650> other<00:02:53.920> when<00:02:54.190> the<00:02:54.280> card<00:02:54.489> is

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
face toward each other when the card is

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.670 
face toward each other when the card is
displayed<00:02:54.910> and<00:02:55.239> that's<00:02:55.359> my<00:02:55.599> preference<00:02:55.870> that

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
displayed and that's my preference that

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.140 
displayed and that's my preference that
I've<00:02:56.829> seen<00:02:57.099> easel<00:02:57.489> cards<00:02:57.760> that<00:02:57.940> have<00:02:58.120> the

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
I've seen easel cards that have the

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.539 
I've seen easel cards that have the
front<00:02:58.540> panels<00:02:58.930> facing<00:02:59.319> out<00:02:59.530> instead<00:02:59.560> so<00:03:00.430> I'll

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
front panels facing out instead so I'll

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.280 
front panels facing out instead so I'll
show<00:03:00.760> you<00:03:00.790> how<00:03:01.060> to<00:03:01.120> do<00:03:01.359> that<00:03:01.540> too<00:03:01.750> just<00:03:01.780> in<00:03:02.200> case

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
show you how to do that too just in case

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.650 
show you how to do that too just in case
you'd<00:03:02.620> like<00:03:02.680> to<00:03:02.950> try<00:03:03.129> it<00:03:03.190> yourself<00:03:03.390> the<00:03:04.390> first

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
you'd like to try it yourself the first

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.390 
you'd like to try it yourself the first
steps<00:03:04.870> for<00:03:04.930> creating<00:03:05.230> the<00:03:05.560> base<00:03:05.769> are<00:03:05.980> the<00:03:06.010> same

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
steps for creating the base are the same

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.599 
steps for creating the base are the same
but<00:03:07.180> the<00:03:07.329> score<00:03:07.690> lines<00:03:07.989> will<00:03:08.349> go<00:03:08.530> instead<00:03:09.010> from

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:09.609 
but the score lines will go instead from

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:12.630 
but the score lines will go instead from
the<00:03:09.790> top<00:03:10.060> of<00:03:10.329> the<00:03:10.540> cut<00:03:10.780> line<00:03:10.810> out<00:03:11.650> to<00:03:11.709> the<00:03:12.190> ends

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
the top of the cut line out to the ends

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:20.770 
the top of the cut line out to the ends
of<00:03:12.760> this<00:03:12.910> scored<00:03:13.329> line

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.230 

whichever<00:03:21.770> method<00:03:21.890> you<00:03:22.220> choose<00:03:22.340> after<00:03:23.000> you've

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:23.240 
whichever method you choose after you've

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.210 
whichever method you choose after you've
made<00:03:23.390> your<00:03:23.450> score<00:03:23.930> lines<00:03:23.960> go<00:03:24.500> ahead<00:03:24.770> and<00:03:24.950> fold

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
made your score lines go ahead and fold

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.130 
made your score lines go ahead and fold
on<00:03:25.460> all<00:03:25.490> the<00:03:25.760> lines<00:03:26.000> and<00:03:26.360> crease<00:03:26.660> them<00:03:26.870> really

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
on all the lines and crease them really

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.320 
on all the lines and crease them really
well<00:03:27.320> with<00:03:27.500> a<00:03:27.530> bone<00:03:27.860> folder<00:03:28.160> or<00:03:28.670> another<00:03:29.000> tool

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
well with a bone folder or another tool

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.540 
well with a bone folder or another tool
I'd<00:03:30.020> like<00:03:30.200> to<00:03:30.320> use<00:03:30.440> the<00:03:30.590> side<00:03:30.800> of<00:03:30.830> my<00:03:31.040> stylus

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
I'd like to use the side of my stylus

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.100 
I'd like to use the side of my stylus
but<00:03:31.700> you<00:03:31.790> can<00:03:31.970> use<00:03:32.120> whatever<00:03:32.330> works<00:03:32.630> for<00:03:32.930> you

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
but you can use whatever works for you

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.440 
but you can use whatever works for you
when<00:03:33.830> you<00:03:33.950> make<00:03:34.160> your<00:03:34.280> creases<00:03:34.790> be<00:03:35.000> sure<00:03:35.240> that

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
when you make your creases be sure that

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.390 
when you make your creases be sure that
your<00:03:35.540> edges<00:03:35.990> are<00:03:36.110> lined<00:03:36.350> up<00:03:36.530> really<00:03:36.830> nicely<00:03:37.040> as

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
your edges are lined up really nicely as

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.470 
your edges are lined up really nicely as
well

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.899 

here<00:03:42.230> you<00:03:42.319> can<00:03:42.500> see<00:03:42.769> the<00:03:42.950> difference<00:03:43.400> between

00:03:43.899 --> 00:03:43.909 
here you can see the difference between

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:45.850 
here you can see the difference between
the<00:03:44.030> two<00:03:44.239> methods<00:03:44.659> of<00:03:44.780> scoring<00:03:45.230> the<00:03:45.379> bass<00:03:45.560> it's

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
the two methods of scoring the bass it's

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.440 
the two methods of scoring the bass it's
just<00:03:46.040> a<00:03:46.129> difference<00:03:46.580> of<00:03:46.730> which<00:03:47.150> ways<00:03:47.420> your

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
just a difference of which ways your

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.330 
just a difference of which ways your
panels<00:03:48.110> will<00:03:48.319> fold<00:03:48.560> when<00:03:48.799> your<00:03:48.920> card<00:03:49.190> is

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
panels will fold when your card is

I used this same die-cut sentiment on

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:43.020 
I used this same die-cut sentiment on
this<00:05:40.570> card<00:05:40.870> for<00:05:41.110> the<00:05:41.199> inside<00:05:41.770> panel<00:05:42.130> but<00:05:42.910> it

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.030 
this card for the inside panel but it

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:44.879 
this card for the inside panel but it
might<00:05:43.300> actually<00:05:43.539> be<00:05:43.810> better<00:05:43.960> to<00:05:44.410> use<00:05:44.590> two

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:44.889 
might actually be better to use two

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:46.800 
might actually be better to use two
separate<00:05:45.430> elements<00:05:45.940> on<00:05:46.060> the<00:05:46.150> inside<00:05:46.570> of<00:05:46.720> the

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:49.780 
card that would be placed toward the

card that would be placed toward the
center<00:05:50.199> of<00:05:50.350> each<00:05:50.530> of<00:05:50.740> the<00:05:50.830> panels<00:05:51.250> when

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.460 
center of each of the panels when

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.219
