enthusiast this lineup of cards these

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.300 
enthusiast this lineup of cards these
happen<00:00:29.029> to<00:00:29.060> be<00:00:29.179> from<00:00:29.419> PNY<00:00:29.929> are<00:00:30.289> a<00:00:30.349> great

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.310 
happen to be from PNY are a great

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.980 
happen to be from PNY are a great
solution<00:00:31.669> that<00:00:32.119> will<00:00:32.210> meet<00:00:32.419> all<00:00:32.630> of<00:00:32.689> your

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:32.990 
solution that will meet all of your

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.069 
solution that will meet all of your
speed<00:00:33.260> and<00:00:33.500> capacity<00:00:34.690> requirements<00:00:35.690> so

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:36.079 
speed and capacity requirements so

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:41.700 
speed and capacity requirements so
what's<00:00:36.320> the<00:00:36.440> difference<00:00:36.890> between<00:00:37.390> SD<00:00:39.250> and

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710 
what's the difference between SD and

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.310 
what's the difference between SD and
SDHC<00:00:43.359> it's<00:00:44.359> important<00:00:44.899> to<00:00:44.989> note<00:00:45.170> the

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
SDHC it's important to note the

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.029 
SDHC it's important to note the
difference<00:00:45.770> because<00:00:46.399> an<00:00:46.550> SDHC<00:00:47.239> card<00:00:47.930> is<00:00:48.170> not

00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:49.039 
difference because an SDHC card is not

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:51.670 
difference because an SDHC card is not
backwards<00:00:49.579> compatible<00:00:49.640> with<00:00:50.390> SD<00:00:50.899> devices<00:00:51.500> so

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
backwards compatible with SD devices so

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.400 
backwards compatible with SD devices so
if<00:00:51.769> you<00:00:51.859> try<00:00:52.070> to<00:00:52.129> put<00:00:52.340> an<00:00:52.460> SDHC<00:00:52.969> card<00:00:53.539> into<00:00:54.379> a

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
if you try to put an SDHC card into a

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.860 
if you try to put an SDHC card into a
device<00:00:54.800> that<00:00:55.070> just<00:00:55.280> takes<00:00:55.579> SD<00:00:55.879> it<00:00:56.269> just<00:00:56.690> won't

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
device that just takes SD it just won't

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.240 
device that just takes SD it just won't
work<00:00:57.019> however<00:00:57.829> an<00:00:58.309> SD<00:00:59.149> card<00:00:59.230> will<00:01:00.230> work<00:01:00.559> in<00:01:00.829> a

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
work however an SD card will work in a

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.740 
work however an SD card will work in a
device<00:01:01.579> that<00:01:01.820> says<00:01:02.230> SDHC<00:01:04.180> for<00:01:05.180> now<00:01:05.300> we<00:01:05.360> want<00:01:05.690> to

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
device that says SDHC for now we want to

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.600 
device that says SDHC for now we want to
talk<00:01:05.900> about<00:01:06.050> the<00:01:06.290> SDHC<00:01:07.070> what's<00:01:07.460> the

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
talk about the SDHC what's the

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.420 
talk about the SDHC what's the
difference<00:01:08.060> between<00:01:08.300> SDHC<00:01:09.290> cards<00:01:09.650> why<00:01:09.920> is<00:01:09.980> one

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
difference between SDHC cards why is one

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.280 
difference between SDHC cards why is one
more<00:01:10.700> expensive<00:01:11.180> than<00:01:11.330> another<00:01:11.390> well<00:01:11.870> aside

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
more expensive than another well aside

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:13.930 
more expensive than another well aside
from<00:01:12.350> the<00:01:12.560> size<00:01:12.920> where<00:01:13.340> you<00:01:13.370> can<00:01:13.580> put<00:01:13.790> more

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 
from the size where you can put more

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.610 
from the size where you can put more
photos<00:01:14.360> on<00:01:14.540> it<00:01:14.720> one<00:01:14.930> of<00:01:15.020> the<00:01:15.110> things<00:01:15.140> you<00:01:15.470> want

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:15.620 
photos on it one of the things you want

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.170 
photos on it one of the things you want
to<00:01:15.680> pay<00:01:15.830> really<00:01:16.010> careful<00:01:16.430> attention<00:01:16.520> to<00:01:16.880> on

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
to pay really careful attention to on

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.470 
to pay really careful attention to on
the<00:01:17.690> card<00:01:17.960> is<00:01:18.170> this<00:01:18.800> number<00:01:19.280> right<00:01:19.580> here<00:01:19.640> that

important difference between these two

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.850 
important difference between these two
is<00:01:49.010> that<00:01:49.390> speed<00:01:50.390> issue<00:01:50.660> the<00:01:51.320> difference<00:01:51.710> on

is that speed issue the difference on

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.470 
is that speed issue the difference on
the<00:01:51.950> speed<00:01:52.280> issue<00:01:52.520> is<00:01:52.760> if<00:01:52.880> you're<00:01:53.000> chasing<00:01:53.390> a

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:53.480 
the speed issue is if you're chasing a

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.200 
the speed issue is if you're chasing a
kid<00:01:53.720> around<00:01:54.050> sports<00:01:54.470> action<00:01:54.800> pets<00:01:55.430> or<00:01:55.730> just

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
kid around sports action pets or just

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.180 
kid around sports action pets or just
trying<00:01:56.450> to<00:01:56.510> take<00:01:56.720> pictures<00:01:57.140> really<00:01:57.650> quickly

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
trying to take pictures really quickly

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.730 
trying to take pictures really quickly
you<00:01:58.700> definitely<00:01:59.240> want<00:01:59.420> to<00:01:59.540> go<00:01:59.690> with<00:02:00.260> the<00:02:00.470> class

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
you definitely want to go with the class

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.580 
you definitely want to go with the class
6<00:02:01.100> device<00:02:01.490> the<00:02:01.820> faster<00:02:02.750> device<00:02:03.050> over<00:02:03.500> the

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
6 device the faster device over the

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.040 
6 device the faster device over the
class<00:02:03.800> 4<00:02:04.130> device<00:02:04.430> so<00:02:05.420> it's<00:02:05.540> the<00:02:05.660> great<00:02:05.840> thing

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
class 4 device so it's the great thing
