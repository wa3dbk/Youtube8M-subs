00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 santimb knows them to Simon Bolivar 

00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:10.779
 in arandas I do not know what I'm going to do because this as 

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:13.779
 employment but supposes dear cantinflas 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.560
 tonight I'm going an important costume country 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:21.690
 I do not know what they put 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.489
 the invitation says well 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:27.419
 and is that this commitment has been quoted and I know many famous 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:29.279
 emancipators 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.920
 tiger looks like this 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.990
 let's not vote that no friend 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.990
 julie modifiers someone who leads ya silva the general 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.390
 it's not bad but he has enough capture to be able 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.730
 represent abraham lincoln 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.040
 there was some emancipator who did not stop 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.210
 I have been able to move from Simón Bolívar, the great liberator of South America 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.310
 It was not very tall and yet it was very large and was small in stature but 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.590
 a textile giant 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.590
 Simón Bolívar was born on July 24, 1783 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.869
 in a large mansion of a beautiful property called san mateo in venezuela 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.210
 he had all the privileges that money can buy and at six he was already 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.400
 an expert horsemen being children of a tour of respected families 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.970
 Venezuelan Simón and his brothers and sisters 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.970
 They lived without worry 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.470
 Well I would prefer a little more worries 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.860
 but more calm 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.230
 Simon Bolivar's life calmed down a bit after his father and mother 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.270
 they died 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.170
 was then sent to live with an affected uncle palaces 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.799
 this arrangement that simón had a new tutor rodríguez carreño 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.670
 palaces the uncle as Simon and all his family among others is Spanish 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.720
 born in venezuela 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.720
 good performance good we are very proud of july 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.110
 This is said to have been stopped by the Spaniards of Spain 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.320
 hungary that the criollos of venezuela where followers it seems to me that 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.989
 that's true 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.999
 teachers are considered second class citizens this is 

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:15.199
 inconceivable 

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:18.599
 many of the pilots the men of end 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:21.750
 and in tasting the wines with 68 you have logged in 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:29.209
 between 17 and 23 years and turned the carefree appointment of a millionaire 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:30.429
 assured 

00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:33.429
 I was more interested in the stigma that Bolivia has 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:39.129
 his years in europe press showed Simon Bolivar what freedom was 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:42.129
 in democracy in action 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:46.729
 little by little he began to think about how to free Venezuela from the Spanish yoke 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:52.459
 the way of being of the Spaniards and its dominion over venezuela the president 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:53.289
 he claimed 

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:56.829
 this was something new in the bolivar family that had been loyal to the 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:59.829
 Spanish crown for more than 200 years 

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:02.199
 I want my country 

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:05.689
 day off 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:08.229
 I want you to have your government prof 

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:11.229
 is what I want not only for Venezuela but to propose 

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:14.330
 Well, that's a great thing 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.999
 but how the magic achieve 

00:03:16.999 --> 00:03:19.999
 with sacrifices and sufferings 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:24.499
 let's achieve 

00:03:24.499 --> 00:03:25.709
 I am sure 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.840
 8 I hope it's very soon because 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.779
 up there because it's so cold 

00:03:29.779 --> 00:03:34.859
 the Spanish government congratulated lung all his recent fears or alert 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:38.089
 to the people of Venezuela to fight for their freedom 

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:40.449
 so at 29 years old 

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:42.789
 bolivar found himself penniless 

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:46.929
 with a tattered little body of 200 volunteers and fighting for a dream 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:51.690
 but nevertheless 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.550
 it would still be many years and battles before he managed to give 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.020
 countries of South America 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.599
 his independence from the Spanish government 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:02.979
 but Simon Bolivar and his men never stopped fighting to give 

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:05.469
 freedom to their young 

00:04:05.469 --> 00:04:08.290
 freedom is a very nice man 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.800
 but it is very difficult to get 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.359
 everything that is worth is very difficult to achieve, you have to fight for it 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.239
 and also preserve 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.979
 Simon Bolivar and his army were liberating 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:23.360
 town other 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.639
 until they practically released 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:27.069
 Venezuela 

00:04:27.069 --> 00:04:30.090
 colombia ecuador peru and police 

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:34.349
 he became the president of the countries refrigerate 

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:38.369
 this was a big problem the people of one country fought against the other country 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.849
 there were constant difficulties 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:46.169
 the nations are gallantly simón bolívar had liberated it seemed that no 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:50.539
 they were ready to be governed even to govern themselves 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:52.749
 same 

00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:56.489
 they will never do slime since also Swedes listen to Simon Bolivar 

00:04:57.499 --> 00:05:00.059
 they must start working 

00:05:00.059 --> 00:05:03.059
 if they want to grow and progress 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.300
 blame for not forgetting so soon the great things that Simón Bolívar wanted 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:09.419
 thus 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:11.199
 people became entangled with your 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:15.110
 own ideas about what was best for their new professionals 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.110
 they forgot the wonderful and fishing police 

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:24.179
 he resigned the presidency in 1830 and went to live in a small village called 

00:05:24.179 --> 00:05:25.990
 sarcoma 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:27.979
 in December of that same year 

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:30.400
 at the age of 47 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.870
 with bolívar site 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:32.710
 3 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.009
 siso 

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:37.689
 bolivar has died 

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:39.669
 For a moment he forgot 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:42.180
 people put their rivalries aside 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.180
 and he joined to mourn the loss of his path 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.680
 so you already decided what costume darling friend 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.520
 I think I'll wear the one that signed a bolivar 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.550
 he is the great defeated 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.089
 a magnificent decision 

00:06:01.089 --> 00:06:03.859
 the horses day of the announcement that if I could avoid it
