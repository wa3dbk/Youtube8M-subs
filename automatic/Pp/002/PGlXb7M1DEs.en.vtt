00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
your apps let's say the dialer over here

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:00.920 
your apps let's say the dialer over here
into<00:00:59.969> one<00:01:00.120> corner<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:00.629> launches

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
into one corner it launches

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.770 
into one corner it launches
automatically<00:01:01.500> but<00:01:02.039> what<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.219> can<00:01:02.370> now<00:01:02.520> do

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
automatically but what you can now do

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.390 
automatically but what you can now do
which<00:01:03.780> is<00:01:03.960> different<00:01:04.110> from<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.500> previous<00:01:04.619> x10

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400

mini<00:01:05.430> pro<00:01:05.670> is<00:01:06.030> that<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.960> corners<00:01:07.290> can

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
mini pro is that the corners can

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.920 
mini pro is that the corners can
actually<00:01:07.650> turn<00:01:07.770> into<00:01:07.830> folders<00:01:08.670> such<00:01:09.659> as<00:01:09.840> we've

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
actually turn into folders such as we've

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.480 
actually turn into folders such as we've
got<00:01:10.080> here<00:01:10.290> so<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:10.770> can<00:01:10.890> have<00:01:10.979> up<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.159> four

almost<00:03:47.060> no<00:03:47.299> flexing<00:03:47.810> going<00:03:47.840> on<00:03:48.579> as<00:03:49.579> you<00:03:49.729> can

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:49.879 
almost no flexing going on as you can

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:55.390 
almost no flexing going on as you can
see<00:03:51.549> it's<00:03:52.549> very<00:03:52.579> solid<00:03:53.060> first<00:03:53.299> 30<00:03:54.310> then<00:03:55.310> you've

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
see it's very solid first 30 then you've

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.050
