watching<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.600> let's<00:00:43.110> get<00:00:43.350> started<00:00:44.010> Bulbasaur

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
watching and let's get started Bulbasaur

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.420 
watching and let's get started Bulbasaur
the<00:00:45.629> seed<00:00:45.899> Pokemon<00:00:46.500> has<00:00:46.649> been<00:00:46.829> described<00:00:47.280> as

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
the seed Pokemon has been described as

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.790 
the seed Pokemon has been described as
both<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.820> plant<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.480> an<00:00:48.719> animal<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.410> I<00:00:49.530> think

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
both a plant and an animal and I think

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.500 
both a plant and an animal and I think
I've<00:00:49.950> got<00:00:50.160> something<00:00:50.460> interesting<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:51.360> can

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
I've got something interesting that can

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.270 
I've got something interesting that can
shine<00:00:51.780> some<00:00:52.050> light<00:00:52.079> on<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.530> subject

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
shine some light on the subject

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.430 
shine some light on the subject
I<00:00:53.309> think<00:00:54.120> that<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.390> plant<00:00:54.660> on<00:00:54.870> Bulbasaur's

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
I think that the plant on Bulbasaur's

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.860 
I think that the plant on Bulbasaur's
back<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:56.039> actually<00:00:56.640> an<00:00:56.730> oddish<00:00:57.149> that<00:00:57.390> evolves

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
back is actually an oddish that evolves

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.500 
back is actually an oddish that evolves
as<00:00:58.020> Bulbasaur<00:00:58.590> evolves<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.309> may<00:00:59.910> be<00:00:59.969> thinking

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
as Bulbasaur evolves you may be thinking

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.510 
as Bulbasaur evolves you may be thinking
there's<00:01:00.780> no<00:01:00.840> way<00:01:01.320> but<00:01:01.680> let's<00:01:01.920> take<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.160> look<00:01:02.399> at

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
there's no way but let's take a look at

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.299 
there's no way but let's take a look at
some<00:01:02.699> evidence<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.300> support<00:01:03.480> this<00:01:03.989> ok<00:01:04.979> Klaus

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
some evidence to support this ok Klaus

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.980 
why don't you help us out by talking
about<00:01:07.200> design<00:01:07.880> just<00:01:08.880> by<00:01:09.090> looking<00:01:09.510> at<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.750> plan

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
about design just by looking at the plan

about design just by looking at the plan
on<00:01:10.229> Bulbasaur's<00:01:10.770> back<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.640> can<00:01:11.790> see<00:01:11.939> a

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
on Bulbasaur's back you can see a

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.940 
on Bulbasaur's back you can see a
striking<00:01:12.570> resemblance<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.409> top<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.830> our

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
on top of Venus aww now that we have

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.640 
on top of Venus aww now that we have
some<00:01:30.420> visual<00:01:30.840> evidence<00:01:31.229> as<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.470> the

some visual evidence as to the

some visual evidence as to the
possibility<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.369> Bulbasaur<00:01:33.000> plant<00:01:33.299> could

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
possibility that Bulbasaur plant could

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.330 
possibility that Bulbasaur plant could
be<00:01:33.509> oddish<00:01:33.900> let's<00:01:34.439> move<00:01:34.680> on<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.100> why<00:01:35.280> this

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
be oddish let's move on to the why this

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.760 
be oddish let's move on to the why this
what<00:01:35.729> happened<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.390> seems<00:01:36.930> like<00:01:37.140> oddish<00:01:37.560> and

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
what happened it seems like oddish and

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.230 
what happened it seems like oddish and
bob<00:01:37.950> saw<00:01:38.220> are<00:01:38.400> living<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.729> mutualistic

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
bob saw are living a mutualistic

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.569 
bob saw are living a mutualistic
relationship<00:01:39.990> which<00:01:40.380> if<00:01:40.680> you<00:01:41.130> don't<00:01:41.280> remember

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
relationship which if you don't remember

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.850 
relationship which if you don't remember
from<00:01:41.850> biology<00:01:42.030> class<00:01:42.420> is<00:01:42.869> when<00:01:43.320> two<00:01:43.560> organisms

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
from biology class is when two organisms

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.100 
from biology class is when two organisms
basically<00:01:44.850> work<00:01:45.060> together<00:01:45.270> so<00:01:45.720> that<00:01:45.840> making

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
basically work together so that making

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.410 
basically work together so that making
each<00:01:46.350> benefit<00:01:46.920> from<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.220> relationship<00:01:47.390> now<00:01:48.390> I

what<00:02:53.190> is<00:02:53.310> Bulbasaur<00:02:53.850> before<00:02:54.209> oddish<00:02:54.570> gets

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
what is Bulbasaur before oddish gets

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.870 
what is Bulbasaur before oddish gets

compatible breeding partners I

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.440 
compatible breeding partners I
discovered<00:02:59.160> the<00:02:59.280> possibility<00:02:59.970> that<00:03:00.000> it's<00:03:00.330> a

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
discovered the possibility that it's a

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.140 
discovered the possibility that it's a
baby<00:03:00.720> Kangaskhan<00:03:01.730> perhaps<00:03:02.730> the<00:03:02.940> baby

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
baby Kangaskhan perhaps the baby

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.300 
baby Kangaskhan perhaps the baby
Kangaskhan<00:03:03.780> can<00:03:04.080> sometimes<00:03:04.620> be<00:03:04.860> joined<00:03:05.190> with

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
Kangaskhan can sometimes be joined with

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.340 
Kangaskhan can sometimes be joined with
oddish<00:03:05.760> so<00:03:06.180> the<00:03:06.420> two<00:03:06.600> can<00:03:06.810> live<00:03:07.050> out<00:03:07.200> the

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
oddish so the two can live out the

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.199 
oddish so the two can live out the

turned<00:03:16.709> green<00:03:17.010> it's<00:03:17.519> supposed<00:03:17.910> to<00:03:18.000> be<00:03:18.180> purple

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
turned green it's supposed to be purple

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.380 
turned green it's supposed to be purple
well<00:03:19.080> I<00:03:19.380> have<00:03:19.739> an<00:03:19.860> answer<00:03:20.190> to<00:03:20.220> that<00:03:20.489> too<00:03:20.850> with

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
well I have an answer to that too with

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.330 
well I have an answer to that too with
the<00:03:21.600> conjunction<00:03:22.140> with<00:03:22.320> oddish<00:03:22.769> the<00:03:23.010> newly

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
the conjunction with oddish the newly

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.070 
the conjunction with oddish the newly
formed<00:03:23.580> Bulbasaur<00:03:24.269> would<00:03:24.540> be<00:03:24.660> filled<00:03:24.989> with

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
formed Bulbasaur would be filled with

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.410 
formed Bulbasaur would be filled with
chlorophyll<00:03:25.769> which<00:03:26.130> is<00:03:26.190> what<00:03:26.459> plants<00:03:26.850> use<00:03:27.090> to

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
chlorophyll which is what plants use to

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.300 
chlorophyll which is what plants use to
gain<00:03:27.570> energy<00:03:27.810> from<00:03:28.049> the<00:03:28.350> Sun<00:03:28.560> chlorophyll

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
gain energy from the Sun chlorophyll

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.190 
gain energy from the Sun chlorophyll
also<00:03:29.700> contains<00:03:30.090> lots<00:03:30.269> of<00:03:30.420> green<00:03:30.690> pigments

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
also contains lots of green pigments

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.380 
also contains lots of green pigments
which<00:03:31.350> would<00:03:31.530> turn<00:03:31.680> the<00:03:31.860> host<00:03:32.070> green<00:03:32.430> also<00:03:33.180> if

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390
