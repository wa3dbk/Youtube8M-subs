you<00:00:18.189> know<00:00:18.279> I've<00:00:18.400> been<00:00:18.430> playing<00:00:18.700> cool<00:00:19.029> amps<00:00:19.419> and

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:19.540 
you know I've been playing cool amps and

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.450 
you know I've been playing cool amps and
speaker<00:00:19.810> cabinets<00:00:20.169> for<00:00:20.290> years<00:00:20.619> and<00:00:21.220> any<00:00:21.369> time

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:21.460 
speaker cabinets for years and any time

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.220 
speaker cabinets for years and any time
I<00:00:21.640> have<00:00:21.939> to<00:00:22.029> use<00:00:22.180> an<00:00:22.300> emulator<00:00:22.419> I'm<00:00:23.020> usually

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:23.230 
I have to use an emulator I'm usually

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.380 
I have to use an emulator I'm usually
less<00:00:23.500> than<00:00:23.529> happy<00:00:23.860> if<00:00:24.189> only<00:00:24.670> because<00:00:24.789> it

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:25.390 
less than happy if only because it

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:26.970 
less than happy if only because it
doesn't<00:00:25.630> feel<00:00:25.720> right<00:00:25.900> it<00:00:26.439> might<00:00:26.590> even<00:00:26.619> sound

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:26.980 
doesn't feel right it might even sound

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.560 
doesn't feel right it might even sound
pretty<00:00:27.160> good<00:00:27.250> but<00:00:27.939> if<00:00:28.029> it<00:00:28.090> doesn't<00:00:28.210> feel<00:00:28.510> good

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570 
pretty good but if it doesn't feel good

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.000 
pretty good but if it doesn't feel good
then<00:00:29.109> I'm<00:00:29.199> going<00:00:29.320> to<00:00:29.380> have<00:00:29.500> a<00:00:29.529> hard<00:00:29.800> time

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.010 
then I'm going to have a hard time

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:31.740 
then I'm going to have a hard time
playing<00:00:30.519> something<00:00:30.970> that<00:00:31.090> sounds<00:00:31.390> great<00:00:31.599> on<00:00:31.720> a

but<00:01:06.880> at<00:01:06.970> the<00:01:07.030> end<00:01:07.060> of<00:01:07.210> the<00:01:07.270> day<00:01:07.450> for<00:01:07.840> guitar

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
but at the end of the day for guitar

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.109 
but at the end of the day for guitar
players<00:01:08.409> it's<00:01:08.710> really<00:01:09.010> all<00:01:09.220> about<00:01:09.250> tone<00:01:09.850> and

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 
players it's really all about tone and

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:13.219 
players it's really all about tone and
this<00:01:10.810> is<00:01:11.020> where<00:01:11.200> eleven<00:01:11.500> rack<00:01:11.650> wheelie<00:01:12.070> shines

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
this is where eleven rack wheelie shines

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.899 
this is where eleven rack wheelie shines
we<00:01:14.229> spent<00:01:14.439> a<00:01:14.469> long<00:01:14.679> time<00:01:14.850> amassing<00:01:15.850> a

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909 
we spent a long time amassing a

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:16.859 
we spent a long time amassing a
collection<00:01:16.359> of<00:01:16.450> some<00:01:16.630> of<00:01:16.689> the<00:01:16.750> most

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
collection of some of the most

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:19.319 
collection of some of the most
sought-after<00:01:17.170> amson<00:01:17.799> history<00:01:18.130> and<00:01:18.310> what<00:01:19.240> we

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:19.329 
sought-after amson history and what we

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:20.910 
sought-after amson history and what we
did<00:01:19.509> with<00:01:19.689> them<00:01:19.840> is<00:01:20.020> something<00:01:20.500> we<00:01:20.619> like<00:01:20.770> to

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
did with them is something we like to

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.380 
did with them is something we like to
think<00:01:21.039> about<00:01:21.189> more<00:01:21.520> like<00:01:21.670> tone<00:01:21.939> cloning

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
think about more like tone cloning

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.389 
think about more like tone cloning
meaning<00:01:23.049> we<00:01:23.350> took<00:01:23.499> those<00:01:23.649> amps<00:01:23.829> apart<00:01:24.189> and

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:24.399 
meaning we took those amps apart and

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:26.039 
meaning we took those amps apart and
emulated<00:01:25.090> the<00:01:25.179> entire<00:01:25.509> signal<00:01:25.780> path

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 
emulated the entire signal path

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:28.230 
emulated the entire signal path
point-to-point<00:01:26.640> capturing<00:01:27.640> all<00:01:27.820> of<00:01:28.149> the

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
point-to-point capturing all of the

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.819 
point-to-point capturing all of the
details<00:01:28.570> that<00:01:28.810> make<00:01:28.960> playing<00:01:29.380> through<00:01:29.649> real

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:29.829 
details that make playing through real

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:31.859 
details that make playing through real
amps<00:01:30.159> feel<00:01:30.549> like<00:01:30.850> playing<00:01:31.179> through<00:01:31.390> real<00:01:31.539> amps

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
amps feel like playing through real amps

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:34.109 
amps feel like playing through real amps
we<00:01:32.499> also<00:01:32.679> use<00:01:32.950> a<00:01:32.979> real-time<00:01:33.429> convolution

we also use a real-time convolution
