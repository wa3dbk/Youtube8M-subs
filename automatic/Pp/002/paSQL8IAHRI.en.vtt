00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
bigger you are the more oxygen your body

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.300 
bigger you are the more oxygen your body
needs<00:02:56.300> and<00:02:56.480> his<00:02:56.810> body<00:02:57.080> requires<00:02:57.380> too<00:02:57.739> much<00:02:57.920> too

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
needs and his body requires too much too

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:59.920 
needs and his body requires too much too
much<00:02:58.430> oxygen<00:02:58.640> because<00:02:59.090> he's<00:02:59.209> so<00:02:59.420> tall<00:02:59.690> and<00:02:59.750> so

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
much oxygen because he's so tall and so

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.740 
much oxygen because he's so tall and so
big<00:03:00.260> so<00:03:00.709> he's<00:03:00.890> not<00:03:01.010> going<00:03:01.220> to<00:03:01.280> last<00:03:01.750> five

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
big so he's not going to last five

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.810 
big so he's not going to last five
rounds<00:03:03.140> gentleman<00:03:03.650> with<00:03:03.860> with<00:03:04.280> anyone<00:03:04.640> really

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
rounds gentleman with with anyone really

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.790 
rounds gentleman with with anyone really
I<00:03:05.000> think<00:03:05.090> he'll<00:03:05.630> burn<00:03:05.930> out<00:03:06.110> entire<00:03:06.500> route

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
I think he'll burn out entire route

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.930 
I think he'll burn out entire route
because<00:03:07.010> he<00:03:07.070> was<00:03:07.190> getting<00:03:07.370> tired<00:03:07.489> at<00:03:07.730> the<00:03:07.820> end

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940
