as an Orthodox I would be

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.750 
as an Orthodox I would be
to<00:00:10.920> have<00:00:11.160> some<00:00:12.230> reservations<00:00:13.230> about<00:00:13.760> the

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:14.760 
to have some reservations about the

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.580

emphasis<00:00:23.990> but<00:00:25.970> it<00:00:26.970> is<00:00:27.240> certainly<00:00:27.810> my

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
emphasis but it is certainly my

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.730 
emphasis but it is certainly my
conviction<00:00:29.189> as<00:00:29.400> an<00:00:29.640> Orthodox<00:00:30.410> that<00:00:31.410> we<00:00:31.590> are

orthodox point of view speaking with
tongues<00:01:24.000> for<00:01:24.510> example<00:01:25.320> is<00:01:25.770> only<00:01:26.690> one<00:01:27.690> among

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
tongues for example is only one among

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.470 
tongues for example is only one among
the<00:01:28.560> charisma<00:01:28.890> tour<00:01:29.250> of<00:01:29.370> the<00:01:29.490> Holy<00:01:29.670> Spirit<00:01:30.270> and

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:30.480 
the charisma tour of the Holy Spirit and

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.050 
the charisma tour of the Holy Spirit and
some<00:01:31.230> Paul<00:01:31.500> did<00:01:31.830> not<00:01:31.860> think<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.550> was<00:01:32.790> the

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
some Paul did not think it was the

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.320 
some Paul did not think it was the
highest<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.750> most<00:01:34.290> important<00:01:35.010> of<00:01:35.220> cádiz<00:01:35.910> Mata

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
highest and most important of cádiz Mata

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:42.470 
highest and most important of cádiz Mata
and<00:01:36.540> so<00:01:37.290> we<00:01:37.800> Orthodox<00:01:39.260> stress<00:01:40.280> other<00:01:41.280> gifts<00:01:42.270> of

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:42.480 
and so we Orthodox stress other gifts of

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.610 
and so we Orthodox stress other gifts of
the<00:01:42.750> Holy<00:01:42.960> Spirit<00:01:44.240> rather<00:01:45.240> than<00:01:45.810> speaking

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 
the Holy Spirit rather than speaking

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:54.170 
the Holy Spirit rather than speaking
with<00:01:46.830> tongues<00:01:47.100> so<00:01:48.060> I<00:01:48.450> am<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.350> qualified<00:01:50.040> carrot

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.880 

I<00:01:54.270> would<00:01:55.260> want<00:01:55.500> people<00:01:55.650> to<00:01:56.070> see<00:01:56.490> their<00:01:57.890> entry

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
I would want people to see their entry

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.100 
I would want people to see their entry
into<00:01:59.120> orthodoxy<00:02:00.770> as<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:02.100> positive<00:02:02.490> step<00:02:03.110> it's

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
into orthodoxy as a positive step it's

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.440 
into orthodoxy as a positive step it's
not<00:02:04.410> a<00:02:04.440> question<00:02:04.920> of<00:02:05.190> renouncing<00:02:05.970> errors

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
not a question of renouncing errors

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.650 
not a question of renouncing errors
rather<00:02:06.750> it<00:02:07.440> is<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.770> question<00:02:08.100> of<00:02:08.429> affirming<00:02:09.390> a

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
rather it is a question of affirming a

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.470 
rather it is a question of affirming a
greater<00:02:10.289> truth<00:02:10.830> I<00:02:11.990> felt<00:02:12.990> in<00:02:13.260> becoming<00:02:13.650> an

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
greater truth I felt in becoming an

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.820 
greater truth I felt in becoming an
Orthodox<00:02:15.480> after<00:02:15.959> having<00:02:16.230> me<00:02:16.380> brought<00:02:16.620> up

the light that I'd received in

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.560 
the light that I'd received in
anglicanism<00:02:25.650> to<00:02:26.280> a<00:02:26.310> greater<00:02:26.670> light<00:02:27.090> in

anglicanism to a greater light in

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.530 
anglicanism to a greater light in

I<00:03:03.030> find<00:03:03.540> in<00:03:03.750> orthodoxy<00:03:04.470> is<00:03:04.680> a<00:03:05.010> greater

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
I find in orthodoxy is a greater

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.479 
I find in orthodoxy is a greater
foodless<00:03:06.269> and<00:03:06.570> I<00:03:07.640> stress<00:03:08.640> the<00:03:08.850> word<00:03:08.880> fullness

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
foodless and I stress the word fullness

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.390 
foodless and I stress the word fullness
therefore<00:03:11.489> I<00:03:12.080> would<00:03:13.080> want<00:03:13.470> people<00:03:13.530> to<00:03:13.830> affirm

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
therefore I would want people to affirm

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.070 
therefore I would want people to affirm
the<00:03:14.820> fullness<00:03:15.680> rather<00:03:16.680> than<00:03:17.100> to<00:03:18.080> renounce

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
the fullness rather than to renounce

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.949 
the fullness rather than to renounce
errors<00:03:19.890> that<00:03:20.549> puts<00:03:21.030> the<00:03:21.239> emphasis<00:03:21.360> in<00:03:21.930> the

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:31.979 

the<00:03:26.170> idea<00:03:27.269> can<00:03:28.269> be<00:03:28.480> defended<00:03:29.200> that<00:03:30.629> we<00:03:31.629> should

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
the idea can be defended that we should

the idea can be defended that we should

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
individual lives but that we should try

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.830 
individual lives but that we should try
to<00:03:39.450> change<00:03:40.450> the<00:03:41.260> whole<00:03:41.440> fabric<00:03:41.799> of<00:03:42.160> society<00:03:42.840> to

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
to change the whole fabric of society to

to change the whole fabric of society to

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
life and that at its best was what a

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.839 
life and that at its best was what a
state<00:03:57.610> like<00:03:57.910> Byzantium<00:03:58.750> was<00:03:58.930> seeking<00:03:59.200> to<00:03:59.410> do
