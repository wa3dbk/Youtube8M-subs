00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.870
 the developer relic entertainment has 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.969
 launched company twists two arden it 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.860
 released a new episode of his popular 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:19.690
 saga of RTS for 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.080
 pc set in the second war 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.080
 world 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.140
 of input the first thing we have to say 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.060
 is that we are facing an expansion 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.070
 independent so to play 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.110
 she is not required to have installed 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.750
 no previous version of classmates 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.329
 turns 2 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.339
 there is a movement of life 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.780
 as a subtitle tells us in this 

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:41.909
 occasion the game focuses on the 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.890
 historical battle of the Ardennes which 

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:45.479
 It was defined by the own winston 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.309
 churchill as the greatest battle 

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:49.500
 american of the war finding us 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.479
 more specifically with a new campaign 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.510
 in which to play in saná for a single 

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:53.510
 player 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.199
 they pulled out of hell nation 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.390
 in this sense the game offers us three 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.010
 companies of the American side that 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.440
 we will be able to command throughout the 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.510
 starting with the mechanized the 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.670
 of support and the transported era what 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.110
 you have to add a fourth fox company 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.270
 which can be purchased separately 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.760
 although it has also been included as a gift 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.710
 with the game reserve each of 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.600
 they have their own officers and 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.460
 unique combat style that will mark 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.590
 our gaming experience having 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.450
 in addition a total of 18 new scenarios 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.700
 of battle of which seven are 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.630
 confrontations inspired directly 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.630
 in the battle of the Ardennes 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:42.260
 and bolt charly coordinates with 47 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.380
 transmit it 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.170
 and once immersed in the action the game 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:55.360
 follows the guidelines set by the 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.979
 previous deliveries finding the ante 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.200
 a real-time strategy title 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.000
 very dynamic and highly tactical in the 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.740
 that knows well the characteristics and 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.570
 skills of each of our 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.420
 troops will be fundamental when it comes to 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.130
 get the victory we will always have 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.810
 of a fairly limited number of 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.670
 soldiers knowing that they lend a lot 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.650
 attention to elements such as the use of 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.950
 coverages or supplies our 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.950
 provision 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.829
 in addition one of the most attractive points 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.569
 of the game is that the campaign is already online 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:31.730
 the position that this takes place in a 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.530
 great tactical map of the Ardennes in the 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.900
 we'll deciding what 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.760
 region we will attack in each turn according to their 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.680
 strategic interest moving by 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.870
 separated to the three companies under 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.239
 our orders providing two each 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.420
 zone a certain bonus so 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:48.650
 that there will never be two equal games 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.239
 although that is not all because the 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.400
 choices that we are taking as 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.019
 length of the game will be crucial not only 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.879
 for the impact they will have on the 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:58.010
 development of the story but also 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:00.079
 about the astro command units since 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.030
 each company will get a great 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:04.220
 number of improvements through four 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.700
 skills and a greater seniority of a 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.019
 mission to another thus increasing its effectiveness 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.430
 although against the units that 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.379
 fall in combat will affect 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.379
 negatively to the general health of the 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:17.060
 army precisely this last one is a 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:18.950
 of the main differences of 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.780
 arkansas or whatever we look for 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.030
 too much in a mission we could 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.530
 end up paying dearly losing 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.530
 our company forever 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.069
 in the fuel riddled before 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.959
 that they leave and before concluding yet 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:43.000
 we have to talk about the graphic section of the 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:45.159
 game being this other of the points 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.519
 where the companion saga has stood out the most 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:47.519
 twists 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.050
 Battleship support ready for deployment 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.340
 this new chapter is not an exception 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.350
 maintaining the same good level of 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.120
 past deliveries where first of all 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.530
 we have to mention the great detail of 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.330
 the scenarios which are 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.100
 destructible lending too 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:06.110
 special attention to the realism of 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.970
 physical and elements such as snow 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.860
 fire while taking into account the 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.450
 time since it was launched 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.190
 the original delivery and they would have been 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:17.290
 desirable the inclusion of some 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.290
 visual improvements of greater importance 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:26.720
 For its part, the sound section continues 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.760
 being also one of the aspects 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.650
 more courts of the game no longer just 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.480
 the very good melodies and effects of 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.340
 sounds but also for a fantastic 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:37.470
 dubbing the Spanish of all the voices 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.780
 German forces outnumber 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.240
 our troops but their lack of 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.550
 fuel gives us an unexpected 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.440
 advantage in summary fellow turns the 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.090
 Sazón pan is a title that does not 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.740
 will disappoint the fans of this successful 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.510
 real-time strategy saga 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.880
 who can now continue to enjoy 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.500
 of the game thanks to an intense new 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.380
 entry campaign in one of the 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.820
 most important battles in history 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.800
 It has seemed to us above all a great 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.300
 It is correct that this time the campaign 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.010
 develop on a large map where 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.570
 our decisions and progress 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:09.590
 will directly affect the 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.590
 course of the war 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.970
 while leaving aside all this in 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.710
 general it is a very title 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.720
 continuist since its section 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.729
 technical in basic mechanics remain 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.620
 intact besides the fact that the game 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:27.660
 offer on this occasion an experience 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.310
 thought to be played only in 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.500
 lonely could disappoint those who 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.729
 would have preferred a further expansion 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.160
 oriented towards the slope 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:36.960
 online multiplayer although this was already 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.790
 possible a few months ago with the 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:42.830
 launch of the previous expansion 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:42.830
 titled the western front arms
