00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
string both those notes play with your

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.620 
string both those notes play with your
index<00:01:32.240> finger

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
index finger

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.870 
index finger
first<00:01:33.200> once<00:01:33.410> a<00:01:33.500> pinch<00:01:33.740> the<00:01:34.280> second<00:01:34.610> one<00:01:34.729> is

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
first once a pinch the second one is

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.630 
first once a pinch the second one is
index<00:01:35.210> finger<00:01:35.509> on<00:01:35.720> the<00:01:35.780> end<00:01:36.530> of<00:01:36.679> one<00:01:36.860> and<00:01:37.190> then

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
index finger on the end of one and then

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.789 
index finger on the end of one and then
the<00:01:37.729> bass<00:01:37.880> follows

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:50.750 

so<00:01:42.609> together<00:01:42.880> you've<00:01:43.090> got

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:50.760 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.090 

after<00:01:51.760> that<00:01:52.410> you're<00:01:53.410> going<00:01:53.530> to<00:01:53.620> have<00:01:53.740> to<00:01:53.860> move

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
after that you're going to have to move

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.700 
after that you're going to have to move
twice<00:01:54.910> as<00:01:54.970> fast<00:01:55.210> with<00:01:55.780> the<00:01:55.870> pinches<00:01:56.350> because

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
twice as fast with the pinches because

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.450 
twice as fast with the pinches because
you're<00:01:56.830> going<00:01:56.950> to<00:01:57.010> do<00:01:57.130> a<00:01:57.160> pinch<00:01:57.430> on<00:01:59.160> one<00:02:00.160> and

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
you're going to do a pinch on one and

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.870 
you're going to do a pinch on one and
then<00:02:01.180> another<00:02:01.390> pinch<00:02:01.660> on<00:02:01.840> three

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.800 

so<00:02:05.570> you're<00:02:05.720> counting<00:02:05.869> one<00:02:06.500> and<00:02:06.920> two<00:02:07.759> and<00:02:08.149> three

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
so you're counting one and two and three

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.660 
so you're counting one and two and three
and<00:02:09.470> four<00:02:09.670> and<00:02:10.670> and<00:02:11.450> then<00:02:12.350> and<00:02:12.680> after<00:02:13.340> that

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
and four and and then and after that

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.870 
and four and and then and after that
with<00:02:14.060> just<00:02:14.989> a<00:02:15.170> pinch<00:02:15.440> on<00:02:15.770> the<00:02:16.430> downbeat<00:02:16.880> of<00:02:16.910> one

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
with just a pinch on the downbeat of one

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.240 
with just a pinch on the downbeat of one
the<00:02:19.880> next<00:02:20.330> set<00:02:21.050> of<00:02:21.080> measures<00:02:21.500> measures<00:02:21.890> five

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
the next set of measures measures five

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.490 
the next set of measures measures five
through<00:02:22.489> eight<00:02:23.080> you<00:02:24.080> have<00:02:24.170> to<00:02:24.260> bring<00:02:24.410> your

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
through eight you have to bring your

through eight you have to bring your
thumb<00:02:24.739> over<00:02:24.950> to<00:02:25.370> the<00:02:25.640> fourth<00:02:25.880> string<00:02:25.940> and<00:02:26.360> then

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
thumb over to the fourth string and then

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.680 
thumb over to the fourth string and then
do<00:02:26.630> everything<00:02:26.810> else<00:02:27.340> exactly<00:02:28.340> the<00:02:28.670> same<00:02:28.910> so

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.710 

index<00:02:32.690> finger<00:02:32.959> twice

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.910 

now<00:02:36.720> it's<00:02:36.960> done<00:02:37.170> back<00:02:37.380> to<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.620> fifth<00:02:37.800> string

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
now it's done back to the fifth string

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.660 
now it's done back to the fifth string
and<00:02:38.280> do

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.820 

this<00:02:42.240> part

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.440 

for<00:02:47.830> the<00:02:47.980> last<00:02:48.190> section<00:02:48.730> the<00:02:48.880> last<00:02:49.180> four

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
offbeat's

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.230 
offbeat's
after<00:03:18.290> you've<00:03:18.410> played<00:03:18.620> a<00:03:18.650> pinch<00:03:18.980> so<00:03:19.850> if<00:03:20.120> you're

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:20.240 
after you've played a pinch so if you're

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.580 
after you've played a pinch so if you're
having<00:03:20.450> any<00:03:20.540> trouble<00:03:20.750> with<00:03:20.990> that<00:03:21.110> in<00:03:21.290> the<00:03:21.380> tune

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
having any trouble with that in the tune

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.680 
having any trouble with that in the tune
itself<00:03:22.040> it<00:03:22.790> might<00:03:22.940> be<00:03:23.060> a<00:03:23.090> good<00:03:23.270> time<00:03:23.420> to<00:03:23.570> go

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
itself it might be a good time to go

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.690 
itself it might be a good time to go
back<00:03:23.870> and<00:03:24.200> check<00:03:24.350> out<00:03:24.530> those<00:03:24.680> exercises<00:03:25.250> I

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
back and check out those exercises I

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.640 
back and check out those exercises I
showed<00:03:26.000> you<00:03:26.120> a<00:03:26.150> little<00:03:26.180> earlier<00:03:26.450> and<00:03:26.960> see<00:03:27.530> if

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
showed you a little earlier and see if

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.410 
showed you a little earlier and see if
you<00:03:27.740> can<00:03:27.980> get<00:03:28.640> it<00:03:28.760> together<00:03:28.880> when<00:03:29.210> you're<00:03:29.300> not

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
you can get it together when you're not

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:30.610 
you can get it together when you're not
worrying<00:03:29.660> about<00:03:29.720> fretting<00:03:30.230> with<00:03:30.290> the<00:03:30.410> left

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
worrying about fretting with the left

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:31.960 
worrying about fretting with the left
hand<00:03:30.890> and<00:03:31.040> then<00:03:31.160> you<00:03:31.250> can<00:03:31.400> come<00:03:31.610> back<00:03:31.640> and

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
hand and then you can come back and

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.400 
hand and then you can come back and
spend<00:03:32.270> a<00:03:32.300> little<00:03:32.390> more<00:03:32.600> time<00:03:32.840> with<00:03:32.870> the<00:03:33.170> tune

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
spend a little more time with the tune

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.530 
spend a little more time with the tune
the<00:03:34.370> other<00:03:34.520> thing<00:03:34.700> you<00:03:34.790> might<00:03:34.910> want<00:03:35.150> to<00:03:35.210> notice

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
the other thing you might want to notice

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.990 
the other thing you might want to notice
is<00:03:35.750> that<00:03:35.780> the<00:03:36.620> second<00:03:37.010> half<00:03:37.160> of<00:03:37.370> each<00:03:37.550> line<00:03:37.820> is

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
is that the second half of each line is

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.400 
is that the second half of each line is
always<00:03:38.210> the<00:03:38.360> same<00:03:38.750> you're<00:03:38.990> always<00:03:39.140> coming

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
always the same you're always coming

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:46.350 
always the same you're always coming
back<00:03:39.680> to<00:03:40.190> the<00:03:40.280> same<00:03:40.520> lick<00:03:40.790> on<00:03:41.000> a<00:03:41.270> minor<00:03:41.570> that

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.390 

so<00:03:47.080> really<00:03:47.530> you<00:03:47.650> just<00:03:47.680> have<00:03:47.890> to<00:03:48.070> learn<00:03:48.190> the

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
so really you just have to learn the

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.970 
so really you just have to learn the
beginning<00:03:48.760> half<00:03:49.060> of<00:03:49.300> each<00:03:49.420> line<00:03:49.720> and<00:03:50.080> then<00:03:50.710> the

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
beginning half of each line and then the

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.650 
beginning half of each line and then the
back<00:03:51.280> half<00:03:51.520> of<00:03:51.670> each<00:03:51.820> line<00:03:52.060> is<00:03:52.270> always<00:03:52.480> going

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
back half of each line is always going

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:53.940 
back half of each line is always going
to<00:03:52.810> be<00:03:52.870> the<00:03:53.080> same<00:03:53.290> you're<00:03:53.440> always<00:03:53.560> coming<00:03:53.860> back

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
to be the same you're always coming back

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.830 
to be the same you're always coming back
to<00:03:54.160> someplace<00:03:54.340> familiar<00:03:54.700> I<00:03:55.210> don't<00:03:55.720> know<00:03:55.780> about

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
to someplace familiar I don't know about

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.750 
to someplace familiar I don't know about
you<00:03:56.080> but<00:03:56.110> anytime<00:03:56.620> I<00:03:56.890> can<00:03:57.130> look<00:03:57.250> at<00:03:57.370> a<00:03:57.400> tune<00:03:57.580> and

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
you but anytime I can look at a tune and

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.490 
you but anytime I can look at a tune and
realize<00:03:58.030> that<00:03:58.060> there's<00:03:58.900> not<00:03:59.050> as<00:03:59.230> much<00:03:59.350> to

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
realize that there's not as much to

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.980 
realize that there's not as much to
learn<00:03:59.590> as<00:03:59.740> I<00:03:59.830> thought<00:04:00.040> I'm<00:04:00.220> a<00:04:00.250> happy<00:04:00.640> guy<00:04:00.990> so

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:01.990 
learn as I thought I'm a happy guy so

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:03.060 
learn as I thought I'm a happy guy so
here's<00:04:02.170> what<00:04:02.290> this<00:04:02.410> tune<00:04:02.560> is<00:04:02.590> going<00:04:02.830> to<00:04:02.890> sound

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.070 
here's what this tune is going to sound

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:05.370 
here's what this tune is going to sound
like<00:04:03.190> if<00:04:03.400> you<00:04:03.490> play<00:04:03.610> it<00:04:03.730> a<00:04:03.790> little<00:04:03.880> more<00:04:04.230> up<00:04:05.230> to

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
like if you play it a little more up to

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:33.820 
like if you play it a little more up to
tempo<00:04:06.330> one<00:04:07.330> two<00:04:07.810> three

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.780 

so<00:04:34.830> spend<00:04:35.190> a<00:04:35.220> little<00:04:35.280> time<00:04:35.550> with<00:04:35.729> the

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
so spend a little time with the

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:37.820 
so spend a little time with the
exercises<00:04:36.229> spend<00:04:37.229> a<00:04:37.290> little<00:04:37.380> time<00:04:37.620> with<00:04:37.770> the

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
exercises spend a little time with the

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.219 
exercises spend a little time with the
tune<00:04:38.040> and<00:04:38.729> it<00:04:39.389> shouldn't<00:04:39.600> be<00:04:39.720> that<00:04:39.870> hard<00:04:40.020> to

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:40.229 
tune and it shouldn't be that hard to

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:41.800 
tune and it shouldn't be that hard to
put<00:04:40.260> everything<00:04:40.590> together<00:04:40.919> once<00:04:41.400> you've

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
put everything together once you've

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.670 
put everything together once you've
gotten<00:04:42.810> that<00:04:43.020> basic<00:04:43.350> right<00:04:43.500> hand

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
gotten that basic right hand

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.400 
gotten that basic right hand
coordination<00:04:44.070> down
