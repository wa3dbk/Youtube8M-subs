00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.490
 hey people and welcome to 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.290
 a youtube canal vienna city fish 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:39.380
 I hope its winter has everything 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.150
 As far as you can get over I am 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.310
 start my this year's video blog 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.830
 with the new slides how to get the company 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.510
 tabs have few baits like this one 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.760
 the last conclusion of such criminals 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.870
 wanted and this winter has the company 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.850
 Depps reprint was brought market 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:59.510
 but which then differ as 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.920
 last of the old in detail from the profile 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.500
 actually, not much has happened 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.390
 In fact it changes at the same time 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.930
 glued but the special is in the 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.090
 inner 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.380
 It is always like the old room 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.630
 the water is his foamed 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.300
 polyurethane body is the new one 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.729
 slides as always 1 hollo profis 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.620
 speak peres brings them that has 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:20.540
 on the one hand, the advantage in you with 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.850
 transparent colors through the 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.380
 Refraction some inside of the body 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.120
 colors more interesting and better 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.830
 However, that really does matter 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.979
 special is that the company tabs 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.560
 Here is a law called spring 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:36.200
 micro system that means so much that in the 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.360
 front head area a little fairy that 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.340
 is and the end of a tungsten ball 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.110
 and that is an advantage if now 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.270
 example, water fishes and at the 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.610
 kid's tour makes a little stop 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.740
 and on it was clear the bait that these 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.720
 error still after swinging and still 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.550
 Natural vibration gives of itself and 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.700
 so one or the other skeptical 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.590
 to make robbers but persuaded something 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.690
 a new slides is still everything 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.700
 what the company depps also took over 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:05.750
 has a relatively strong trend at the moment 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:08.119
 Japan is these white marks 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.099
 it probably on the head as well as on the back part 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.110
 that has the advantage if now for 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.810
 an obstacle to a new cooler 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.540
 wanted to pass by very convenient one 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.730
 to one where your bait is but 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.530
 the predator of so the attack of 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.300
 the side or bottom takes off 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.800
 actually this additional color 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.690
 mark not true 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.800
 technically the new leipzig 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.570
 extremely 7 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.780
 I therefore go to the 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.430
 desired throw of the dance and need 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.710
 then only one evenly 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.390
 cool here, the water runs through 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.920
 closely pulled runway 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.480
 if I am here with one or the other 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.860
 Strengthen outbreak if you can 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.510
 not somehow played with his back 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:50.220
 beat but simply give light 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.870
 impulses with the crank itself from the 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.420
 roof depth can be really 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.680
 fish from zero to a maximum so 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.270
 two and a half meters 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.370
 it always depends on which 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.240
 only stronger me but my flight though 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:05.610
 really needs a screw user 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:08.280
 the size 175 I use the tabs 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:12.060
 Schildgasse 81 in combination with the 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.590
 yoga break being my hotline 0 40 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.330
 Airport change that also has the 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.490
 advantage that despite the high 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.480
 actually drop nicely 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.760
 so no additional 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.830
 I have water resistance when I mean 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.880
 body sink certain water depth 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:29.940
 Let's turn for the 250 he wants 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:32.340
 the website operators in combination with 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.800
 The Thai people are bigger too 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.900
 I use a flight from here at the 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.390
 Strength 0 45 why do I always attack 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.280
 again trip and flew off with the 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.050
 ford because in combination with the base 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.930
 that we are much rounder 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.739
 look more natural 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.390
 but it is important that you 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.370
 Watching my route used 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.350
 certain industries have the tip of it 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.420
 just think and how can we do that 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:57.780
 slice with a soft silicone skin 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.550
 covered when the predator my 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.620
 children grab hold that I force 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.180
 this is enough because I'm moving forward 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.989
 really can move a hook 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.150
 to sit well 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.709
 but now have a theory enough 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.300
 around banter let's see the whole 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.300
 things nature has on it 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.640
 to decide about 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:54.490
 that was me very bad for that 19 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:57.039
 As you have seen, not only do you go up 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:59.319
 always quite concerned but yours 

00:05:57.039 --> 00:06:02.039
 luck yourself a lot on the water and 

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:02.039
 Until next time
