00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.280
 hello to all and welcome to my 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.990
 video so today we find ourselves 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.490
 for a little video how to make a 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.740
 signature rack 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.150
 so I'm doing this video just for 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.230
 show you roughly how do you do 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.150
 but I will not put it down because 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.369
 that since he's in terrarium right there 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.680
 so already as a substrate you will need 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.920
 of the sopalin it is practical fast not 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.109
 expensive 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.570
 then you need some ventilation here 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.399
 the vents pauthe actually has it you 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.840
 need fake plant so you 10 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:41.930
 positioned roughly as you want 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:41.930
 so well authors as his one to one the 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:49.190
 and another big plants like this here 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.390
 then what is really practical 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.280
 it's frankly girl bamboos 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:02.650
 it's really great for tracking 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:04.170
 so here it is here 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.100
 cup to put them is not at home 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.640
 him that you have 10 positioned a little 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.619
 as you want the sticks that's like 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.250
 that's not bad it's all proven between 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:16.740
 the celine must be planted like that 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.450
 so here it seems it's mostly the base 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.130
 then what you need is a 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.890
 gryon box like that makes you 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.509
 will fill the earth up there 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.220
 because the crested gecko likes it 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:28.869
 dig so I have gay mares 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.840
 convince is dug in the ground one 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:33.039
 lets you work here and you 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.110
 fill in term and ipad car 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:38.080
 unfortunately and then do not forget 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.729
 had to change once a day the rac and 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.619
 of m duration not every three days 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.060
 about my flash and omit the gecko 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:44.500
 rack just to show you but 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.610
 otherwise he stays in terrarium of any 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.720
 so I will not put it in the harbor 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.350
 would serve me nothing else I have a 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.420
 terrarium 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.770
 but hey I know subscribers to me 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.810
 who want to put it in rack so he 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.610
 there is no harm to that but in fact you 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.700
 just have to close with the vents 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.679
 it's nickel so I hope this 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.849
 little video you liked it anyway 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:02.200
 I took pleasure in doing 

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:04.000
 do this little video there I hope so 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.410
 we helped more than one and we find ourselves at 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.830
 next week for a little 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.349
 video 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.130
 and do not forget that I will be stopping the 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:11.580
