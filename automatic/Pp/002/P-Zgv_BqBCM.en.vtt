00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
or to run away from the pack it will be

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.100 
or to run away from the pack it will be
a<00:02:50.350> special<00:02:50.950> place<00:02:51.190> anyway<00:02:51.730> because<00:02:51.940> at<00:02:52.930> this

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
a special place anyway because at this

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.820 
a special place anyway because at this
moment<00:02:53.170> you<00:02:53.740> can<00:02:53.980> be<00:02:54.010> trained<00:02:54.760> Ted<00:02:55.030> well<00:02:55.270> but

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
moment you can be trained Ted well but

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.250 
moment you can be trained Ted well but
your<00:02:56.830> body<00:02:57.070> started<00:02:57.760> you<00:02:57.940> you<00:02:58.300> can't<00:02:58.900> run

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
your body started you you can't run

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.800 
your body started you you can't run
anymore<00:02:59.590> or<00:03:00.190> your<00:03:00.730> body<00:03:00.970> comes<00:03:01.330> running<00:03:01.660> in

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
order and then this is the moment where

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.730 
order and then this is the moment where
the<00:03:03.370> brain<00:03:03.670> starts<00:03:04.060> to<00:03:04.270> run<00:03:04.510> and<00:03:05.320> maybe<00:03:05.470> this

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740 
the brain starts to run and maybe this

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.490 
the brain starts to run and maybe this
is<00:03:05.890> the<00:03:06.250> thing<00:03:06.930> where<00:03:07.930> it's<00:03:08.050> most<00:03:08.290> difficult
