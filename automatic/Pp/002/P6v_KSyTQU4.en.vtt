00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
let's talk about the potential of a

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.190 
let's talk about the potential of a
little<00:01:56.520> gap<00:01:56.820> or<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.180> little<00:01:57.420> hole<00:01:57.659> when<00:01:58.020> you

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
little gap or a little hole when you

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.819 
little gap or a little hole when you
turn<00:01:58.890> here<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.700> catch<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.450> stitches<00:02:00.840> if<00:02:01.170> I

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
turn here and catch the stitches if I

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.950 
turn here and catch the stitches if I
were<00:02:02.189> to<00:02:03.409> turn<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.860> grab<00:02:05.610> that<00:02:06.000> very<00:02:06.540> very

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
were to turn and grab that very very

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.960 
were to turn and grab that very very
first<00:02:07.259> V<00:02:07.619> it's<00:02:07.829> kind<00:02:08.069> of<00:02:08.160> stretched<00:02:08.489> out<00:02:08.670> here

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
first V it's kind of stretched out here

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.130 
first V it's kind of stretched out here
the<00:02:09.869> problem<00:02:10.470> with<00:02:10.649> that<00:02:10.890> is<00:02:11.390> if<00:02:12.390> I

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
the problem with that is if I

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.960 
the problem with that is if I
knit<00:02:13.350> into<00:02:13.740> it<00:02:13.890> which<00:02:14.130> is<00:02:14.250> what<00:02:14.400> I<00:02:14.430> tend<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:14.819> do

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
knit into it which is what I tend to do

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.700 
knit into it which is what I tend to do
I<00:02:15.000> knit<00:02:15.360> in<00:02:15.569> I<00:02:15.690> don't<00:02:15.750> pick<00:02:16.200> up<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.500> stitches

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
I knit in I don't pick up the stitches

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.190 
I knit in I don't pick up the stitches
on<00:02:17.040> a<00:02:17.069> needle<00:02:17.490> and<00:02:17.610> then<00:02:17.730> knit<00:02:17.790> them<00:02:18.120> up<00:02:18.240> see

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
on a needle and then knit them up see

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.290 
on a needle and then knit them up see
that's<00:02:19.470> that's<00:02:20.430> what<00:02:20.610> I'm<00:02:20.700> talking<00:02:21.090> about

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
that's that's what I'm talking about

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.449 
that's that's what I'm talking about
that<00:02:21.480> kind<00:02:21.660> of<00:02:21.780> gabby<00:02:22.200> thing<00:02:22.620> that<00:02:22.980> can<00:02:23.250> happen

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
that kind of gabby thing that can happen

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.390 
that kind of gabby thing that can happen
at<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:23.880> beginning<00:02:24.000> so<00:02:24.990> what<00:02:25.140> i<00:02:25.170> do<00:02:25.410> is<00:02:26.040> i<00:02:26.220> kind

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
at the beginning so what i do is i kind

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.630 
at the beginning so what i do is i kind
of<00:02:26.520> just<00:02:26.670> play<00:02:26.910> around<00:02:27.319> here<00:02:28.319> is<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:29.370> stitch

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
of just play around here is the stitch

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.960 
of just play around here is the stitch
below<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.240> one<00:02:30.390> i've<00:02:30.570> made<00:02:30.840> i<00:02:31.220> might<00:02:32.220> go<00:02:32.459> down

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
below the one i've made i might go down

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.070 
below the one i've made i might go down
a<00:02:33.030> stitch<00:02:33.630> and<00:02:34.020> knit<00:02:34.920> into<00:02:35.100> that<00:02:35.520> and<00:02:36.080> look

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
a stitch and knit into that and look

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.170 
a stitch and knit into that and look
that's<00:02:37.350> not<00:02:37.709> so<00:02:37.950> bad<00:02:37.980> see<00:02:38.520> that<00:02:38.700> kind<00:02:39.000> of

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
that's not so bad see that kind of

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.080 
that's not so bad see that kind of
that's<00:02:39.600> pretty<00:02:39.900> tidy<00:02:40.280> then<00:02:41.280> what<00:02:41.550> I<00:02:41.580> might<00:02:41.910> do

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
that's pretty tidy then what I might do

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.930 
that's pretty tidy then what I might do
is<00:02:42.239> really<00:02:43.110> turn<00:02:44.810> my<00:02:46.520> stitches<00:02:47.520> on<00:02:47.640> the<00:02:47.730> side

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
is really turn my stitches on the side

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.510 
is really turn my stitches on the side
and<00:02:48.120> I<00:02:48.239> might<00:02:48.540> knit<00:02:48.720> into<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:48.989> back<00:02:49.190> stitch

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
and I might knit into the back stitch

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.880 
and I might knit into the back stitch
the<00:02:50.910> back<00:02:51.120> half<00:02:51.420> that's<00:02:51.989> what<00:02:52.200> I<00:02:52.230> tend<00:02:52.560> to<00:02:52.650> do

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
the back half that's what I tend to do

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.830 
the back half that's what I tend to do
is<00:02:53.100> I<00:02:53.220> tend<00:02:53.400> to<00:02:53.519> really<00:02:54.050> twist<00:02:55.050> my<00:02:56.840> slip

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
is I tend to really twist my slip

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.660 
is I tend to really twist my slip
stitches<00:02:58.350> so<00:02:58.500> that<00:02:58.530> I<00:02:58.680> can<00:02:58.980> get<00:02:59.130> into<00:02:59.459> the

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
stitches so that I can get into the

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.070 
stitches so that I can get into the
farthest<00:03:00.390> half<00:03:00.989> of<00:03:01.380> each<00:03:01.590> stitch<00:03:02.180> and<00:03:03.180> what<00:03:04.050> I

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
farthest half of each stitch and what I

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.170 
farthest half of each stitch and what I
will<00:03:04.230> do<00:03:04.500> now<00:03:04.769> see<00:03:05.190> now<00:03:05.220> there's<00:03:05.700> not<00:03:05.880> really<00:03:06.060> a

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
will do now see now there's not really a

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.830 
will do now see now there's not really a
gap<00:03:06.600> and<00:03:07.370> well<00:03:08.370> there<00:03:08.700> kind<00:03:08.940> of<00:03:09.030> is<00:03:09.180> there<00:03:09.510> see

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
gap and well there kind of is there see

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.540 
gap and well there kind of is there see
it<00:03:10.080> kind<00:03:10.350> of<00:03:10.440> depends<00:03:10.769> on<00:03:10.890> how<00:03:10.950> much<00:03:11.280> that's

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
it kind of depends on how much that's

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.320 
it kind of depends on how much that's
going<00:03:11.760> to<00:03:11.820> bother<00:03:12.030> you<00:03:12.269> that<00:03:12.480> bothers<00:03:13.170> me<00:03:13.380> so

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
hmmmm I going to fix that well you know

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:23.569 
hmmmm I going to fix that well you know
maybe<00:03:18.420> I<00:03:18.840> can<00:03:18.959> do<00:03:19.370> something<00:03:20.370> like<00:03:21.500> this<00:03:22.579> see

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
maybe I can do something like this see

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:24.830 
maybe I can do something like this see
that's<00:03:23.760> what<00:03:23.880> I'm<00:03:23.970> saying<00:03:24.000> it<00:03:24.450> kind<00:03:24.750> of

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
that's what I'm saying it kind of

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.319 
that's what I'm saying it kind of
depends<00:03:25.230> on<00:03:25.560> your<00:03:25.769> yarn<00:03:26.130> how<00:03:26.579> stretchy<00:03:26.970> it<00:03:27.209> is

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
depends on your yarn how stretchy it is

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:29.569 
depends on your yarn how stretchy it is
the<00:03:28.110> colors<00:03:28.470> will<00:03:28.620> see<00:03:28.739> that's<00:03:28.890> not<00:03:29.130> so<00:03:29.340> bad

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
the colors will see that's not so bad

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.940 
the colors will see that's not so bad
and<00:03:29.880> then<00:03:30.209> now<00:03:30.570> go<00:03:30.930> into<00:03:31.260> the<00:03:31.380> back<00:03:31.620> of<00:03:31.650> the

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
and then now go into the back of the

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.930 
and then now go into the back of the
very<00:03:32.190> next<00:03:32.459> stitch<00:03:32.850> oh<00:03:33.440> look<00:03:34.440> at<00:03:34.590> that<00:03:34.940> that's
