00:00:07.969 --> 00:00:11.760
 all dear christmas is ahead of the 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.260
 door and if you have no present for 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.169
 you should have loved ones then 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.419
 this recipe is what you need now 

00:00:16.169 --> 00:00:21.060
 See you soon white chocolates 

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:22.529
 liqueur imitate and if you already 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.599
 have gifts and you just have 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.970
 like to get drunk with delicious league 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:28.439
 then it stays with him after tastes 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.090
 really divine 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:38.210
 I just like to cook 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:41.960
 and sometimes quite good for the white 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:45.050
 chocolate cream cucumber you need around 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.350
 or whiskey white chocolate cream and 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.070
 milk 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:51.410
 that 's it so few ingredients so easy 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.629
 oh, oh well, there are two more pots 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.550
 for a water bath and with the water bath 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:57.680
 Let's get started with the chocolate 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.660
 now broken into small pieces and 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.739
 comes in the heated top and while 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.960
 the chocolate melts you have 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:07.420
 actually nothing to do that is 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.420
 really a lot at the club 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:11.000
 I mean the chocolate melts 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.470
 to me 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.090
 meantime you can do that 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.369
 Throw away the chocolate packaging 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.710
 and I have a nice bottle 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.680
 bought that is like the oil and the 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.680
 vinegar that I have you so in the 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.000
 I look at a bottle in which is believable 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.289
 I do not even take that from the animals 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.539
 The last time I was from Ikea is 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:32.960
 I believe each other after bought before 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:34.490
 all euro 50 costs nothing and is 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.780
 nevertheless a really nice gift 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.690
 while I'm on the melting 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.920
 chocolate is waiting for the label 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.630
 prepare for the bottle 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.170
 this may be the really nice decorated na 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:49.450
 there you can do your creative and so you 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.450
 you can completely live out your creativity 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.950
 to make it even more personal 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.070
 16 small kussmund So all depends on 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.930
 bmi that gives but if that for yours 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.310
 then you can really eat 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:13.820
 a little cosmo on it hey that is 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:16.780
 really nice many good idea and it does 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:20.750
 a bit my lack of it 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:24.080
 artistic skills in painting 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:27.680
 I find an empty bottle of water 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:30.260
 chocolate dream and the dream is that 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.090
 one is, so to speak, in his fantasy 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.810
 can create much more beautiful than 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.950
 what is actually in it 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.800
 So I found that always understands 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.680
 what I mean 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.930
 am a bit like if you now 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.460
 melted is you take the 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:51.820
 whipped cream or the whipped cream and 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:54.050
 becomes the 1 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:56.000
 also fits with the cream that goes completely 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.830
 Quick that the chocolate begins to 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.200
 lump so stir well 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.870
 and then it was already the alcohol 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.000
 to be tipped and stirred 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.340
 become 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.940
 and it is important that ideas are not 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:13.610
 somehow too long to cook because 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.959
 he should still stay in there so have 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.000
 We do not have the shot we need 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:19.340
 I have taken far too much rum 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.770
 just that it was actually the 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.120
 whole house now from the stove important now 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.160
 from the herd that's not the alcohol 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.459
 overcooked 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.900
 We do not want that and then it could be 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.580
 even in the bottling bottles on 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.480
 best is for you one 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.480
 funnel increases 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.799
 the 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.170
 I have a small funnel 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:47.540
 homemade from the bottle neck 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.829
 a plastic bottle and it works 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.750
 surprisingly good 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:52.849
 So you should not funnel home 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.140
 have a plastic bottle but I will 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:56.450
 In any case, now insert me because 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.650
 needs almost every day on each 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.480
 case I have now as you see 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.840
 can a full three quarters of the bottle 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:05.310
 with the cream 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.530
 chocolate mixture and now you fill 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.780
 Just do it again with the milk 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:16.620
 the end is up to the opera which 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:17.730
 Up to the milk you could do it 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:22.139
 also so and actually has 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:24.120
 such an artistic artistic 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:25.470
 optics I think but I would you 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:31.460
 now just recommend the bottle 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:31.460
 close and shake well 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:39.630
 they could then mix everything up 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:42.510
 wonderful and now you can of course 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.710
 do not drink right away but put it down 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:47.640
 first in the fridge overnight 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:51.240
 and then the consistency becomes one too 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:53.870
 bit the liquid as well as a cream 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.280
 liqueur I also think I heard and then 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.020
 can you enjoy it yourself or 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.960
 give away and someone else with it 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.070
 make you very happy 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.620
 that's the way it could be 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:07.170
 Give away as a gift or pure 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.940
 but enjoy a little secret from 

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:11.400
 I like the best in the 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.500
 combination with a chocolate did 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.480
 a really tasty recipe for it 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.680
 I link you here on this and now 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.000

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.380

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.510
