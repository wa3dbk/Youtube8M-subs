00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:03.450
 OK 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.580
 from the first movie of robocop and 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.950
 the animated series of the transformers 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.930
 in the 80s we have fallen in love with the 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.119
 robots we play in the history of the 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.519
 videogames and we made a list of the 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:20.010
 most amazing robotic characters 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:24.320
 here is our top 5 robots in 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.320
 most favorite video games in history 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.329
 we can not do this without mentioning the 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.320
 most famous robot superhero of the 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:41.600
 history in videogames 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.970
 megaman has saved the world dozens of 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.810
 times and we have all played his adventure 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:51.560
 at least once in our lives 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:54.650
 did you know that the first mega man of 1987 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.660
 took place between 2000 and 2009 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.820
 this means that this little 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.390
 blue guy could appear in 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.390
 any time 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:28.820
 and everyone who has played borderlands does not 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.710
 I could forget to mention clarifying this 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.260
 little robot did not cover your back 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:37.420
 or gave you ammunition but if a good 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.420
 attitude and bright comments 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:48.220
 and your sense of humor can be 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:51.210
 irritating but claptrap can not avoid 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.210
 make you smile 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.799
 plus 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.170
 what you write 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:14.000
 maybe you know him by his number 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:17.840
 series of 54 29 601 or maybe you call it 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.630
 xj 04 61 as most people 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.000
 know this robot simply as plank 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.110
 being the ratchet partner in the 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.130
 franchise games 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.130
 Ryan Clark 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:39.750
 this little robot is not only a good 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.750
 friend is also a useful companion 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.560
 if not 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.560
 for 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:03.190
 in the master not many robots have won 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:06.120
 the same affection we feel for bailing 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.120

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.280

 knights of the old republic quickly 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:18.000
 He became a favorite among fans thanks 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.000
 to his witty dialogues 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.700
 since its conception by a gentleman it 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.430
 he calls people meet back sacks of 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:34.950
 meat and sees the act of killing as a 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.950
 excellent way to solve problems 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.280
 i 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.550
 we did not want to put two characters from 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.500
 same game on this list what 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.690
 it means that we had to choose between 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.150
 clay 2 and portal willy for the 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:19.790
 position number 1 after long 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.790
 discussions we will choose a weekly 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.010
 while there is law 2 is a malign e 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:33.450
 unforgettable master mind with a 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.450
 deviant sense of humor 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:41.530
 it's whitney who we enjoy the most 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.690
 you just can not avoid the charm 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.850
 of this little neurotic robot with the 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:48.060
 voice of British comedian Stephen
