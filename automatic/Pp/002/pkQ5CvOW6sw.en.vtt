 Hi everyone, this video I get one 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:16.090
 series of traps in Sicilian defense 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:19.119
 this first video we'll try 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.939
 from bobby fischer 's trap 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:25.000
 this is a real game played 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:28.779
 between fish and rechavi that the championship 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.680
 north american of 58 in new york 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:36.070
 started with a c4 and c5 lightweight three horse 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:39.579
 horses and six of pictures and take of 4 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:43.350
 horse take from 4 to 16 is that we have 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:48.539
 an accelerated adage in the Sicilian 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:52.899
 horses and 3117 bishop and 3 horse is 6 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:55.510
 will develop c4 where help the 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:58.000
 control in the house of 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:01.809
 5 against the advance of the black pawn of five 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.590
 and lowering 4 also maintains a pressure of 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:09.190
 f7 people as we will see same and picture 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:11.380
 rock would go main bishop b3 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.290
 we are here in the main variant o 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:17.260
 dragon receives that in this 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:21.430
 position and 58 in the north championship 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:23.350
 American made a horse at 5 is one of the 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:30.040
 my moves being that the main 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:33.010
 here is the 6 horse to 5 and fischer in that 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:37.120
 position prepared a trap is 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:40.030
 this studied variant he made is 5 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:43.530
 attacking the horse df 6 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:47.080
 today knows if after the bid is 5 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:50.260
 after bid is 5 the best answer for 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:53.800
 black is to make a horse of 3 following the 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:55.510
 ideal take f6 horse take one and 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.300
 of 7 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:01.330
 White won two plays for two 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:06.490
 black pieces by the tower and has a light 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:09.750
 advantage here if I made a mistake 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:13.120
 fatal in this position falling into the trap 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:18.069
 making horse is the idol and in that position 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:22.030
 Black is completely lost. 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:25.689
 peta khullar throw here what a sacrament 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:28.239
 this white advantage with bishop takes f7 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:32.680
 we will now see the consequences of this 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:35.620
 toss the first answer, the resume r7 and 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:40.689
 nor the second horse spectacular bid is 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:42.670
 6 attacks lady attacks houses and 7 and house b6 

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:45.669
 which would be another king's escape house 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.400
 is controlled by Bishop Day 3 

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:53.919
 you see that the horse 5 pulls out a 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:56.409
 house of escape of the lady of tomé 6 

00:02:53.919 --> 00:03:04.419
