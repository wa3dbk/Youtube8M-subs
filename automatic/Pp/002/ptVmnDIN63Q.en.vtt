make it so that's going well another
offensive<00:01:49.680> rebound<00:01:49.860> here<00:01:50.520> which<00:01:51.299> you<00:01:51.810> can<00:01:51.960> see

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
offensive rebound here which you can see

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.950 
offensive rebound here which you can see
I<00:01:52.470> don't<00:01:52.680> have<00:01:52.950> very<00:01:53.610> good<00:01:53.729> finishing<00:01:54.720> skills

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
I don't have very good finishing skills

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.469 
I don't have very good finishing skills
at<00:01:55.229> all<00:01:55.290> at<00:01:55.680> this<00:01:55.770> point<00:01:56.070> so<00:01:56.460> it'll<00:01:57.030> be<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.329> the

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
at all at this point so it'll be to the

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.920 
at all at this point so it'll be to the
line<00:01:57.689> here<00:01:58.640> two<00:01:59.640> points<00:01:59.939> four<00:02:00.420> rebounds<00:02:00.450> at

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
line here two points four rebounds at

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.179 
line here two points four rebounds at
this<00:02:01.079> point<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.640> so<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:03.180> first<00:02:03.450> shot<00:02:04.189> this

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
this point and so the first shot this

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.809 
this point and so the first shot this
shot<00:02:05.430> goes<00:02:05.930> but<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.770> second<00:02:08.129> shot<00:02:08.340> I<00:02:08.550> believe

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
shot goes but the second shot I believe

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.660 
shot goes but the second shot I believe
is<00:02:10.299> not<00:02:10.659> made<00:02:10.929> as<00:02:11.650> you<00:02:11.799> see<00:02:11.950> an<00:02:12.040> okay<00:02:12.370> release

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
is not made as you see an okay release

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.390 
is not made as you see an okay release
so<00:02:13.060> only<00:02:13.749> one<00:02:13.989> of<00:02:14.049> two<00:02:14.139> there<00:02:14.590> from<00:02:15.099> the<00:02:15.219> line

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
so only one of two there from the line

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.199 
so only one of two there from the line
back<00:02:16.359> on<00:02:16.569> the<00:02:16.689> offensive<00:02:17.129> end<00:02:18.129> of<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.150> floor

up for such a big player now there's a

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:39.559 
up for such a big player now there's a
nifty<00:02:36.250> pass<00:02:36.430> but<00:02:36.819> the<00:02:37.510> defense<00:02:37.989> recovers<00:02:38.950> and

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
nifty pass but the defense recovers and

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.690 
nifty pass but the defense recovers and
denies<00:02:40.569> the<00:02:40.840> bucket<00:02:41.200> so<00:02:41.769> here<00:02:42.280> playing<00:02:42.519> some

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700

defense<00:02:42.879> again<00:02:43.780> no<00:02:44.049> block<00:02:44.319> or<00:02:44.530> anything<00:02:44.829> but

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
defense again no block or anything but

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.300 
defense again no block or anything but
again<00:02:45.810> make<00:02:46.810> him<00:02:46.959> alter<00:02:47.290> his<00:02:47.469> shot<00:02:47.739> just

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
enough to make him miss so there's a

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.170 
enough to make him miss so there's a
defensive<00:02:52.150> rebound<00:02:52.569> actually<00:02:53.199> nope<00:02:53.439> I<00:02:53.650> think

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
defensive rebound actually nope I think

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.780 
defensive rebound actually nope I think
the<00:02:55.180> play<00:02:55.449> was<00:02:55.659> blown<00:02:55.989> dead<00:02:56.199> beforehand<00:02:56.980> but

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
the play was blown dead beforehand but

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.520 
the play was blown dead beforehand but
it<00:02:58.299> was<00:02:58.449> always<00:02:58.689> the<00:02:58.810> end<00:02:58.930> of<00:02:58.989> the<00:02:59.049> second<00:02:59.379> half

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
it was always the end of the second half

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.470 
it was always the end of the second half
is<00:02:59.739> where<00:02:59.889> first<00:03:00.250> half<00:03:00.430> is<00:03:00.579> what<00:03:00.730> it<00:03:00.819> was<00:03:00.939> so<00:03:01.449> I

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
is where first half is what it was so I

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.080
