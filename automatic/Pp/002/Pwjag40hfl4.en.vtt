00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.390
 plus 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.590
 the air consists mainly of 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:16.379
 oxygen nitrogen and water we need 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.810
 air to stay alive however 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.640
 we can easily use oxygen and 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.750
 the nitrogen found in the 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.750
 air for other applications 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.779
 for example the nitrogen used in 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.250
 Packaging prevents gradual oxidation 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:35.210
 what keeps the products fresh 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.210
 for more time 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.719
 the nitrogen used in tires is 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:43.239
 it escapes more slowly than the air 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:46.089
 normal tablet this results in less 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:48.969
 Wear better performance and greater 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:50.649
 safety since nitrogen is not 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:52.780
 Flammable is used frequently 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:54.399
 for the prevention of fires in 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.290
 Deposits that contain waste 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:58.960
 flammable and gas mixtures 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.329
 explosives 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.850
 the space above the content of the 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:06.310
 tanks are filled with nitrogen which 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.090
 covers the load like a blanket 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.090
 not flammable 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.360
 this method of creating a blanket of 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:17.299
 nitrogen is also used when 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.850
 ignite flammable gases the blanket of 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:22.340
 nitrogen in the pipe prevents any 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.290
 recoil of flame nitrogen 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.060
 It is also used for washing 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.060
 tubes that are used to transport 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.250
 flammable substances operations 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.320
 of underground drilling such as 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.140
 in coal mines frequently 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.119
 they let escape gray and flammable gas the 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.310
 Washing with nitrogen also helps 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:43.399
 avoid fires or explosions in this 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.470
 situations reduction 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:47.569
 percentage of oxygen in the air through 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.940
 of the addition of nitrogen helps 

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:52.000
 prevent rapid oxidation fire and 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.550
 explosions and gradual oxidation 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.860
 decomposition 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.480
 the use of parker membranes from the 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.430
 petrochemical industry until the 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.430
 food industry is growing 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:06.190
 constantly because for a reason 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:09.390
 simple the parker membranes offer the 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:12.370
 better performance at the lowest price 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.470
 the enriched nitrogen is produced at 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.680
 pass compressed air through the 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.690
 fibrous gas separating membranes 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.340
 properties of these hollow membranes 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.260
 allow water and oxygen 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.079
 escape through the walls 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.849
 permeable thus trapping a high 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:29.330
 nitrogen concentration in your 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:31.700
 inside 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.680
 The required capacity is obtained at 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.500
 fit thousands of these fibers into one 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.750
 membrane module 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.570
 this same principle can be applied 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.400
 to produce more enriched oxygen 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:46.460
 details about this process 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.830
 will provide the component later 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:52.100
 basic fibrous membranes parker 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:54.620
 is the polyphenol oxide in this 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.930
 Synthetic substance patented by parker 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.270
 gives a porous and spongy structure to 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.209
 the membranes with an outer shell 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:04.100
 only 40 nanometers thick is 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.780
 that's why the parker membranes are 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.540
 much more permeable than those of the 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.760
 competition however the membranes 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.830
 parker offer many more advantages 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.470
 Here is a list of them 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.390
 the high permeability of the membranes 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.489
 parker allows to produce the same 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.340
 amount of nitrogen at a pressure 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:24.709
 operation of only 7 bar than others 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.350
 products do it at a pressure of 13 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:30.080
 bar therefore the parker membranes 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.150
 consume less energy while low 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.280
 the operating pressure helps prolong 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.470
 the life of the compressor what 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.200
 lowers the price of system design 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.960
 the parker membranes do not need a 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.700
 supply of hot compressed air 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.780
 at the time of energy expenditure in 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.970
 heaters 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.790
 The parker membranes have a diameter 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.860
 greater and are stronger are less 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.870
 susceptible to inlays and 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.300
 they have an average life of more than 10 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.400
 years 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:01.100
 the aging process of 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.840
 poly phenyl oxide membranes in or 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.850
 ends before the product is 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.740
 delivered to the customer therefore 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.510
 receives a stable product that does not suffer 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.780
 no loss of productive capacity 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.790
 as time goes by the high 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.220
 permeability of the parker membranes 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.320
 means that fewer modules are needed 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.269
 of membranes and thanks to its high 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.240
 performance can also be used 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.890
 smaller modules as a result the 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.600
 parker membranes are used in 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:29.060
 industries where weight and volume 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.760
 They play a key role such 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.740
 like oil gas industries 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.660
 maritime and aerospace transport 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.730
 parker provides membrane modules 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.860
 individuals that can adapt to the 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:42.260
 customer's particular needs 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.450
 The range also includes a series of 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:48.160
 standardized nitrogen generators 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:48.160
 that are ready to be used 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.650
 many companies still use deposits 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.080
 of liquid nitrogen 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:09.290
 parker of this as a very concept 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.480
 outdated nitrogen generators 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:13.640
 with membrane is parker are so highly 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:16.310
 productive results that much more 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:18.740
 efficient and less expensive to produce one 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.870
 same its own nitrogen compared to 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.730
 a nitrogen supply tank 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:25.550
 the annual cost of operating a 

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:28.100
 nitrogen generator parker is 50% 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:30.080
 minor as a result you can recover your 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:32.630
 investment in the nitrogen generator 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.220
 parker in less than a year more still 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:37.070
 avoids the risk of price increases 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.720
 of nitrogen suppliers other 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:41.240
 advantage is that production can 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.820
 proceed uninterruptedly as you 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.890
 you will never run out of nitrogen parker 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:47.990
 has special programs for 

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:50.540
 calculate the benefits of the costs of 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:52.490
 the modules and generators parker in 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:54.200
 comparison with other suppliers for 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.000
 any requirement 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:59.920
 parker guaranteed to receive the 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.920
 lowest cost and the highest performance 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:05.470
 and not only in the area of â€‹â€‹commerce after 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:07.480
 of all parker can still be of 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:09.250
 utility for you even when you 

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:11.110
 find at home when using the same 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:13.300
 principle that applies to production 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:15.280
 of nitrogen our generators 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:17.320
 special oxygen can raise a 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.390
 percent the oxygen level of 

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:21.280
 a room the oxygen is also 

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:23.650
 can add to the air used in the 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.510
 steam baths after spending only 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:28.030
 a few minutes in a rich environment 

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:31.920
 oxygen will start to feel much more 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:31.920
 healthy and able to perform more 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:42.470
 parker the high performance is in the 

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:42.470
 air
