00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:07.620
 but below, if I'm not mistaken, you can see that there is 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.870
 the mega van the truck lays the vehicle 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.900
 more beautiful than ever 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.900

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.900

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.670
 briefcase this crushed him 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:26.180
 very bad but very bad 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.180
 no hailed not save their friend 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:37.760
 ciaopeople I am at the bie and welcome back 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:40.650
 here on the battlefield earth line beta 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.829
 in the second mode available that 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.489
 I don't remember the face high east stakes 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.769
 the name 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.660
 I only know that there are two briefcases that 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:52.650
 we criminals have to take go to 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.390
 place on vans later 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.620
 they will explode are not between seen well 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.580
 now gentlemen we'll find out together 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.940
 this bike can't make curves 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:06.600
 vast renunciation we continue for the 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.100
 ours at km that shoots really loud bye 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.000
 exaggerated recoil a rocket and not 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.830
 very high but bad words we must 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.229
 protect the wearer wait 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.020
 wait for eyes then or not is left to 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.750
 feet and several frenzies in this one 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.710
 modality 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.430
 this mode of the summit are 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.040
 decidedly ferrara 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.970
 if all go to one place 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.940
 would like to see each other jump out 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.870
 This morning's comics are going strong 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:36.830
 look at how many you crush 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:41.990
 12 and very large the triple that with the 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:45.410
 rai machine there are three others 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.970
 crush of the crushed all I have 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:50.690
 emptied the bridge with the car 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:55.729
 fantastic how to take the 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:57.350
 recipe ok come on come on come on come on 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:02.030
 come come we have to run we have 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:06.710
 26400 of life's great escape not 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:08.270
 I know why you went down but come on but come on 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.179
 we have to be her give him protection 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:14.310
 of the permit only 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:18.569
 to scenario machines with rpg 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.569
 shame at home at home 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.480
 however I must say that this is a 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.519
 enemy there on the ground called him buckets 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.739
 I must say that this part there I see him 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:32.379
 very well for team play 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:34.090
 because it is very collaborative 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:35.980
 there alone is substantially hollow 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.600
 few spiders out of the hole 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:43.950
 my mother what a philosophy 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:49.530
 there is still one 18 advantage can come out 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:51.660
 I already knew that cherie ok well they have 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.580
 opened a pickup truck so we have to 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:58.560
 be careful that you do not take the 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:03:01.190
 I saw the ultra briefcase fortunately 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.190
 never missed 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:08.740
 if he says there is still one at least 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.490
 never managed to snatch the da ianieri 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.800
 lose you did not let yourself be killed 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.690
 then everyone will really be there then 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:18.680
 here believe me gone this distance yes 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:21.440
 laugh no let's use them as a diversion they are 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.450
 lasted very little help were in 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.370
 many were many from the director yes 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.280
 move we follow it with the helicopter go 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.960
 go of a bad reason to grizzo 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.960
 way to try to make them lose 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:35.480
 time and do not place yourself where I am 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.670
 going to a guy on a motorcycle doesn't turn around 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:43.370
 round 16 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:46.700
 go it is mine you know a great no 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:50.000
 ankara 1 very large live look like 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:54.410
 get the 007 flag 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.670
 catapulting from the helicopter from 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:59.930
 come and give me a hand if they did it 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:02.000
 a rom give birth what to what i love 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.070
 numbers I can take great good 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.680
 to ice so you don't have to sclerate when i 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:13.870
 your companions also give you maybe one 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:18.239
 place of the heck you beat big 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.239
 three great great this collaboration 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.930
 but the fact that they can be taken 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:27.080
 weapons from the relationship is a thing not 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:29.130
 undervaluable I would say arrive arrive 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:32.490
 one i got you are shooting from 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:36.920
 left so much wished of seal 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.920
 mini revolver ladies you are ready 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.910
 we unlocked the flak jacket again 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:45.830
 I don't know what this still looks good 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.830
 in case I think they are bears 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:52.699
 it's raining enemies I think he's dead 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.740
 we light the fucking suitcase friends 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:58.250
 kids don't even have time to breathe 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:00.830
 a perfect day is luckily better 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:04.729
 it means that balancing works well 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:08.870
 we are approaching blows well the 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:10.729
 lace or it's over then state has 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.169
 took these cesar and maicon memories 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:15.560
 memories we follow him we follow him 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:18.949
 such have been up are also opening up 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:24.009
 the door of the second briefcase is there 

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:24.009
 our 26 26 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:32.000
 I know you are here I know you are here he will know 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:35.199
 upstairs took another shell do 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.199
 real robin high bank then 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:42.540
 but this did not die out big e 

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:44.040
 let's do the second if we care in a row if 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:47.210
 closing the deal has fallen I like it 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.210
 pronouncing the French 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:10.440
 great big by the zip line 

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:12.750
 no, because there it was removed but cowardly 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:14.430
 this made us fall like a pear 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:17.280
 now I remind you that the frames that you are 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:19.740
 seeing at the top are generated by one 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:22.080
 alone of my two gp in 60 because it 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:26.400
 sly obviously does not have a profile yet 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:28.700
 with these video settings on high 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.410
 off the good automatic 

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:33.470
 and I must say that it seems a lot 

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:38.330
 well optimized to be a beta 

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:42.560
 so I 'm glad you're going go go if 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:47.720
 had st briefcase thrown down are 

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:49.430
 twelve people who have stayed 

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:52.430
 making go in the ladder direction in 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:57.520
 very bad way here with the rpg with 

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:57.520
 the RPGs we have won anyway 

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:02.840
 so guys this was the second one 

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:04.940
 mode of the available beta that exists 

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:07.100
 thanks for following me the appointment 

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:09.460
