the<00:01:38.689> first<00:01:38.929> thing<00:01:39.139> I<00:01:39.289> thought<00:01:39.469> to<00:01:39.649> do<00:01:39.799> is<00:01:40.069> to

00:01:40.419 --> 00:01:40.429 
the first thing I thought to do is to

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:43.690 
the first thing I thought to do is to
flatten<00:01:41.090> the<00:01:41.450> top<00:01:41.689> on<00:01:42.020> the<00:01:42.200> sanding<00:01:42.560> disc<00:01:42.799> this

flatten the top on the sanding disc this

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.059 
flatten the top on the sanding disc this
enables<00:01:44.299> it<00:01:44.450> to<00:01:44.479> sit<00:01:44.810> flat<00:01:45.109> against<00:01:45.619> the<00:01:45.709> Chuck

00:01:46.059 --> 00:01:46.069 
enables it to sit flat against the Chuck

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:49.629 
enables it to sit flat against the Chuck
or<00:01:46.310> faceplate<00:01:46.880> this<00:01:47.719> bowl<00:01:48.020> is<00:01:48.289> almost<00:01:49.039> too<00:01:49.429> big

to<00:01:49.819> flatten<00:01:50.179> on<00:01:50.359> a<00:01:50.420> 12<00:01:50.899> inch<00:01:51.049> sander<00:01:51.670> then<00:01:52.670> is

00:01:52.839 --> 00:01:52.849 
to flatten on a 12 inch sander then is

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:54.940 
to flatten on a 12 inch sander then is
that<00:01:52.999> went<00:01:53.179> of<00:01:53.329> the<00:01:53.389> lathe<00:01:53.539> I<00:01:53.840> realized<00:01:54.619> the

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
that went of the lathe I realized the

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.969

bowl that just over my Chuck with this
close<00:01:58.279> fit<00:01:58.609> I<00:01:58.789> could<00:01:59.179> have<00:01:59.299> skipped<00:01:59.689> sanding

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259

looking pretty good now now for the
interior<00:02:54.950> I'll<00:02:55.760> start<00:02:56.150> with<00:02:56.330> a<00:02:56.390> gouge<00:02:56.540> and

even out the rim I'd rather do this
first<00:03:00.080> so<00:03:00.830> I<00:03:01.070> can<00:03:01.400> have<00:03:01.700> a<00:03:01.970> good<00:03:02.300> entry<00:03:02.810> surface

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
first so I can have a good entry surface

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.030 
first so I can have a good entry surface
to<00:03:03.710> recall<00:03:04.460> the<00:03:04.820> interior<00:03:05.530> then<00:03:06.530> I'm<00:03:06.710> going
