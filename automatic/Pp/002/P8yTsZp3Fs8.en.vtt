in outside we had matches the city and

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.040 
in outside we had matches the city and
then<00:00:49.800> just<00:00:50.520> three<00:00:50.789> days<00:00:50.820> later<00:00:51.300> we<00:00:51.899> have

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
then just three days later we have

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.229 
then just three days later we have
invited<00:00:52.260> night<00:00:52.559> did<00:00:52.739> so<00:00:53.280> going<00:00:54.000> into<00:00:54.120> this

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
invited night did so going into this

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.729 
invited night did so going into this
match<00:00:54.510> I<00:00:54.660> did<00:00:54.809> have<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:54.930> kind<00:00:55.199> of<00:00:55.320> rotate<00:00:55.620> my

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
match I did have to kind of rotate my

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.979 
match I did have to kind of rotate my
squad<00:00:56.039> because<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:57.030> lot<00:00:57.329> of<00:00:57.360> my<00:00:57.480> players<00:00:57.719> were

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
squad because a lot of my players were

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.360 
squad because a lot of my players were
on<00:00:58.170> low<00:00:58.350> energy<00:00:58.680> levels<00:00:59.010> which<00:00:59.129> obviously

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
on low energy levels which obviously

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.069 
on low energy levels which obviously
isn't<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.789> problem<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.719> end<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:00.989> season

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
isn't a problem the end of the season

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.840 
isn't a problem the end of the season
because<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:01.559> only<00:01:01.680> have<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:01.920> few<00:01:02.190> games<00:01:02.489> left

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
because you only have a few games left

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.700 
because you only have a few games left
and<00:01:03.030> like<00:01:03.660> i<00:01:03.690> said<00:01:03.899> before<00:01:04.019> my<00:01:04.320> night<00:01:04.530> with

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
and like i said before my night with

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.649 
and like i said before my night with
only<00:01:04.830> three<00:01:05.159> days<00:01:05.189> after<00:01:05.610> this<00:01:06.210> game<00:01:06.420> so<00:01:06.630> I

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
only three days after this game so I

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.750 
only three days after this game so I
obviously<00:01:06.990> need<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.409> rotate<00:01:08.310> my<00:01:08.549> school

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
obviously need to rotate my school

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.429 
obviously need to rotate my school
otherwise<00:01:09.000> they<00:01:09.299> were<00:01:09.390> probably<00:01:09.570> get<00:01:10.110> injured

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
otherwise they were probably get injured

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.310 
otherwise they were probably get injured

Fernandez<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.079> more<00:01:40.229> experienced<00:01:41.220> players

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
Fernandez the more experienced players

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.550 
Fernandez the more experienced players
who<00:01:41.640> could<00:01:41.759> close<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.210> game<00:01:42.390> out<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:43.350> maybe

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
who could close the game out and maybe

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.530 
who could close the game out and maybe
even<00:01:43.950> get<00:01:44.250> another<00:01:44.759> goal<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.119> bring<00:01:45.210> us<00:01:45.420> the

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
even get another goal to bring us the

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.270 
even get another goal to bring us the
lead<00:01:45.720> but<00:01:46.290> unfortunately<00:01:46.920> I<00:01:46.950> just<00:01:47.130> couldn't

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
lead but unfortunately I just couldn't

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.370 
lead but unfortunately I just couldn't
get<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.460> extra<00:01:47.850> call<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.119> didn't<00:01:48.360> finish<00:01:48.450> 10<00:01:48.750> it

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
get the extra call I didn't finish 10 it

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.480 
get the extra call I didn't finish 10 it
was<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.530> good<00:01:49.680> result<00:01:49.979> of<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.130> etihad<00:01:50.460> stadium

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
was a good result of the etihad stadium

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.620 
was a good result of the etihad stadium
but<00:01:50.970> was<00:01:51.210> it<00:01:51.390> enough<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:52.380> grab<00:01:52.649> us<00:01:52.829> or<00:01:53.040> at<00:01:53.340> least

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
but was it enough to grab us or at least

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.999 
but was it enough to grab us or at least
Savior<00:01:54.630> our<00:01:54.810> fence<00:01:55.229> position<00:01:55.619> spot<00:01:55.860> and

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
Savior our fence position spot and

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.120 
Savior our fence position spot and
unfortunately<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:57.600> wasn't<00:01:57.869> enough<00:01:58.259> after<00:01:58.950> all

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
unfortunately it wasn't enough after all

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.679 
unfortunately it wasn't enough after all
of<00:01:59.250> that<00:01:59.280> it<00:01:59.520> just<00:01:59.670> wasn't<00:01:59.700> enough<00:02:00.030> as<00:02:00.329> he<00:02:00.390> seen

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
of that it just wasn't enough as he seen

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.060 
of that it just wasn't enough as he seen
that<00:02:00.869> it<00:02:00.960> was<00:02:01.079> still<00:02:01.229> possible<00:02:01.439> because<00:02:01.950> we

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
that it was still possible because we

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.920 
that it was still possible because we
were<00:02:02.189> six<00:02:02.729> points<00:02:03.030> behind<00:02:03.180> Newcastle<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:03.810> we

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
were six points behind Newcastle and we

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.870 
were six points behind Newcastle and we
had<00:02:04.049> two<00:02:04.229> games<00:02:04.469> left<00:02:04.680> but<00:02:05.399> if<00:02:05.549> you<00:02:05.640> look<00:02:05.790> at

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
had two games left but if you look at

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.459 
had two games left but if you look at
that<00:02:05.969> goal<00:02:06.149> difference<00:02:06.420> Newcastle's<00:02:07.259> where

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
that goal difference Newcastle's where

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.690 
that goal difference Newcastle's where
was<00:02:07.860> 21<00:02:08.340> and<00:02:08.459> I<00:02:08.550> was<00:02:08.670> is<00:02:08.789> only<00:02:09.060> two<00:02:09.479> ahem<00:02:10.349> so<00:02:11.099> we

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
was 21 and I was is only two ahem so we

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.370 
was 21 and I was is only two ahem so we
couldn't<00:02:12.030> reach<00:02:12.150> that<00:02:12.330> spot

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
couldn't reach that spot

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.930 
couldn't reach that spot
because<00:02:13.680> I'll<00:02:13.860> get<00:02:14.010> a<00:02:14.040> six<00:02:14.370> position<00:02:14.730> spot

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
because I'll get a six position spot

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.450 
because I'll get a six position spot
which<00:02:15.060> loop<00:02:15.270> who<00:02:15.450> were<00:02:15.600> in<00:02:15.780> but<00:02:16.440> obviously<00:02:17.250> we

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
which loop who were in but obviously we

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.160 
which loop who were in but obviously we
were<00:02:17.580> aiming<00:02:17.760> for<00:02:18.180> at<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:18.870> first<00:02:19.050> position

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
were aiming for at the first position

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.810 
were aiming for at the first position
spot<00:02:19.590> which<00:02:19.740> would<00:02:19.860> bring<00:02:20.010> us<00:02:20.160> that<00:02:20.340> Europa

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
spot which would bring us that Europa

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.370 
spot which would bring us that Europa
League<00:02:20.970> and<00:02:21.240> we<00:02:21.690> couldn't<00:02:21.900> reach<00:02:22.080> you<00:02:22.110> after

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
League and we couldn't reach you after

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.470 
League and we couldn't reach you after
all<00:02:22.530> we<00:02:22.860> tried<00:02:23.160> out<00:02:23.370> for<00:02:23.460> a<00:02:23.520> we've<00:02:24.060> been<00:02:24.210> pushed

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
all we tried out for a we've been pushed

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.880 
all we tried out for a we've been pushed
to<00:02:24.600> the<00:02:24.690> limit<00:02:24.990> but<00:02:25.380> there<00:02:25.530> were<00:02:25.620> still<00:02:25.680> two

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
to the limit but there were still two

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.500 
to the limit but there were still two
games<00:02:26.280> left<00:02:26.550> in<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:26.790> season<00:02:26.850> though<00:02:27.240> we<00:02:27.360> could

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
games left in the season though we could

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.830 
games left in the season though we could
still<00:02:27.750> get<00:02:28.380> that<00:02:28.440> position<00:02:29.040> and<00:02:29.300> to<00:02:30.300> bring<00:02:30.780> a

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
still get that position and to bring a

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.420 
still get that position and to bring a
star<00:02:31.020> six<00:02:31.230> position<00:02:31.590> which<00:02:31.710> leave<00:02:31.920> Liverpool

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
star six position which leave Liverpool

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.190 
star six position which leave Liverpool
weigh-in<00:02:32.730> and<00:02:33.270> I<00:02:33.510> guess<00:02:33.660> we<00:02:33.780> could<00:02:33.930> head<00:02:34.050> the

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
weigh-in and I guess we could head the

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.990 
weigh-in and I guess we could head the
season<00:02:34.470> on<00:02:34.530> high<00:02:34.710> year<00:02:34.920> with<00:02:35.100> I<00:02:35.280> guess<00:02:35.490> a<00:02:35.520> win

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
season on high year with I guess a win

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.400 
season on high year with I guess a win
against<00:02:36.270> my<00:02:36.420> net<00:02:36.630> I<00:02:36.780> mean<00:02:36.840> that<00:02:37.140> would<00:02:37.290> be

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
against my net I mean that would be

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.560 
against my net I mean that would be
brilliant<00:02:37.850> especially<00:02:38.850> like<00:02:39.000> a<00:02:39.030> winner<00:02:39.300> into

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
brilliant especially like a winner into

Barclays Premier League but obviously
heartbreaking<00:03:13.800> for<00:03:13.920> me<00:03:13.980> because<00:03:14.460> tried<00:03:15.330> so

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
heartbreaking for me because tried so

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.010 
heartbreaking for me because tried so
hard<00:03:15.630> and<00:03:16.220> we<00:03:17.220> push<00:03:17.490> the<00:03:17.670> limit<00:03:18.030> we<00:03:18.180> beam<00:03:18.390> him

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
hard and we push the limit we beam him

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.650 
hard and we push the limit we beam him
doing<00:03:19.920> our<00:03:20.010> best<00:03:20.190> at<00:03:20.430> nearly<00:03:20.700> every<00:03:20.820> game<00:03:21.390> to

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
doing our best at nearly every game to

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.390 
doing our best at nearly every game to
try<00:03:21.780> and<00:03:21.990> reach<00:03:22.110> that<00:03:22.320> first<00:03:22.650> position<00:03:23.100> spot

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
try and reach that first position spot

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.070 
try and reach that first position spot
and<00:03:23.610> at<00:03:24.090> the<00:03:24.300> end<00:03:24.420> we<00:03:24.480> just<00:03:24.690> couldn't<00:03:24.930> reach<00:03:25.050> it

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
and at the end we just couldn't reach it

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.810 
and at the end we just couldn't reach it
but<00:03:25.320> I<00:03:25.380> guess<00:03:25.590> we<00:03:25.800> could<00:03:25.950> improve<00:03:26.250> next<00:03:26.490> season

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
but I guess we could improve next season

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.730 
but I guess we could improve next season
and<00:03:26.970> there's<00:03:27.450> always<00:03:27.750> things<00:03:27.990> to<00:03:28.140> improve<00:03:28.530> and

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 
and there's always things to improve and

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.730 
and there's always things to improve and
I<00:03:28.890> am<00:03:29.400> I'm<00:03:29.730> like<00:03:30.570> ninety<00:03:30.900> percent<00:03:31.110> sure<00:03:31.470> that

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:31.740 
I am I'm like ninety percent sure that

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.110 
I am I'm like ninety percent sure that
we<00:03:31.860> will<00:03:32.010> reach<00:03:32.250> this<00:03:32.430> position<00:03:32.730> spot

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
we will reach this position spot

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.120 
we will reach this position spot
especially<00:03:33.330> the<00:03:33.720> way<00:03:33.840> we<00:03:33.870> played<00:03:34.350> and<00:03:34.620> in

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
especially the way we played and in

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.760 
especially the way we played and in
these<00:03:35.220> last<00:03:35.430> episodes<00:03:35.910> i<00:03:36.030> think<00:03:36.270> really<00:03:36.960> like

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
these last episodes i think really like

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.730 
these last episodes i think really like
november<00:03:38.400> time<00:03:38.640> or<00:03:39.180> december<00:03:39.990> time<00:03:40.200> cost<00:03:40.500> us

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:40.740 
november time or december time cost us

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.190 
november time or december time cost us
and<00:03:41.010> we<00:03:41.220> did<00:03:41.370> have<00:03:41.490> a<00:03:41.550> very<00:03:41.760> good<00:03:41.940> start<00:03:42.180> and<00:03:42.420> i

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
and we did have a very good start and i

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.210 
and we did have a very good start and i
think<00:03:43.500> i<00:03:43.560> think<00:03:43.590> in<00:03:43.830> the<00:03:43.890> middle<00:03:44.100> of<00:03:44.130> the

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
think i think in the middle of the

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.340 
think i think in the middle of the
season<00:03:44.430> our<00:03:44.850> performances<00:03:45.660> drop<00:03:45.959> which<00:03:46.140> I

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
season our performances drop which I

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.860 
season our performances drop which I
think<00:03:46.890> cost<00:03:47.160> us<00:03:47.370> those<00:03:47.580> pointin<00:03:48.150> should<00:03:48.780> have

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
think cost us those pointin should have

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.330 
think cost us those pointin should have
really<00:03:49.080> picked<00:03:49.260> up<00:03:49.410> those<00:03:49.560> points<00:03:49.920> from<00:03:50.070> like

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
really picked up those points from like

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.010 
really picked up those points from like
Wigan<00:03:50.760> and<00:03:50.940> teams<00:03:51.150> like<00:03:51.360> that<00:03:51.510> in<00:03:51.600> Cardiff

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020 
Wigan and teams like that in Cardiff

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.510 
Wigan and teams like that in Cardiff
which<00:03:52.470> we<00:03:52.590> weren't<00:03:52.830> doing<00:03:52.950> at<00:03:53.160> the<00:03:53.220> start<00:03:53.459> of

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
which we weren't doing at the start of

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.449 
which we weren't doing at the start of
the<00:03:53.610> season<00:03:53.790> and<00:03:54.060> it<00:03:55.020> cost<00:03:55.230> us<00:03:55.470> I<00:03:55.830> guess<00:03:56.340> the

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
the season and it cost us I guess the

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.699 
the season and it cost us I guess the
fifth<00:03:56.640> position<00:03:56.790> and<00:03:57.410> obviously<00:03:58.410> the<00:03:58.590> goal

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
fifth position and obviously the goal

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.110 
fifth position and obviously the goal
difference<00:03:59.010> as<00:03:59.190> well<00:03:59.370> which<00:03:59.550> was<00:03:59.700> a<00:03:59.730> lot<00:03:59.940> lower

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
difference as well which was a lot lower

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.390 
difference as well which was a lot lower
than<00:04:00.270> Newcastle's<00:04:00.959> that<00:04:01.170> cost<00:04:01.410> us<00:04:01.650> now<00:04:02.190> I<00:04:02.220> know

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
than Newcastle's that cost us now I know

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.250 
than Newcastle's that cost us now I know
that<00:04:02.550> we<00:04:03.120> have<00:04:03.300> a<00:04:03.330> lot<00:04:03.540> of<00:04:03.570> firepower<00:04:03.900> in

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
that we have a lot of firepower in

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.070 
that we have a lot of firepower in
attack<00:04:04.530> in<00:04:04.920> Sydney<00:04:05.310> and<00:04:05.490> diet<00:04:06.120> and<00:04:06.240> Pablo

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
attack in Sydney and diet and Pablo

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.560 
attack in Sydney and diet and Pablo
Hernandez<00:04:07.560> but<00:04:07.740> obviously<00:04:08.040> before<00:04:08.420> january<00:04:09.420> i

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
Hernandez but obviously before january i

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:10.910 
Hernandez but obviously before january i
was<00:04:09.720> struggling<00:04:09.990> that<00:04:10.260> is<00:04:10.380> the<00:04:10.500> reason<00:04:10.650> why<00:04:10.830> i

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
was struggling that is the reason why i

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.230 
was struggling that is the reason why i
should<00:04:11.160> all<00:04:11.250> danny<00:04:11.459> green<00:04:11.730> because<00:04:12.030> we<00:04:12.150> were

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:12.240 
should all danny green because we were

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.210 
should all danny green because we were
struggling<00:04:12.480> to<00:04:12.600> go<00:04:12.870> go<00:04:13.050> so<00:04:13.290> hopefully<00:04:13.740> with

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
struggling to go go so hopefully with

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.340 
struggling to go go so hopefully with
this<00:04:14.280> new<00:04:14.459> attack<00:04:14.790> now<00:04:15.000> we<00:04:15.690> would<00:04:15.930> we<00:04:16.320> would

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
this new attack now we would we would

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.140 
this new attack now we would we would
get<00:04:16.590> a<00:04:16.650> lot<00:04:16.830> more<00:04:16.890> gravel<00:04:17.400> lot<00:04:17.459> more<00:04:17.670> girls<00:04:17.880> and

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
get a lot more gravel lot more girls and

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.180 
get a lot more gravel lot more girls and
hopefully<00:04:18.840> our<00:04:18.870> goal<00:04:19.560> difference<00:04:19.890> doesn't

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
hopefully our goal difference doesn't

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.550 
hopefully our goal difference doesn't
won't<00:04:20.730> cost<00:04:20.910> us<00:04:21.060> because<00:04:21.359> it's<00:04:21.690> always<00:04:21.989> it's

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
won't cost us because it's always it's

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.590 
won't cost us because it's always it's
always<00:04:22.740> bad<00:04:23.040> to<00:04:23.280> be<00:04:23.400> heated<00:04:23.760> to<00:04:23.790> at<00:04:24.300> the<00:04:24.510> end

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
always bad to be heated to at the end

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.570 
always bad to be heated to at the end
lose<00:04:24.840> on<00:04:25.020> goal<00:04:25.229> difference<00:04:25.530> really<00:04:25.770> it<00:04:25.979> about

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
lose on goal difference really it about

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.999 
lose on goal difference really it about
a<00:04:26.659> fifth<00:04:27.659> position<00:04:27.780> spot<00:04:28.169> which<00:04:28.319> is<00:04:28.470> I<00:04:28.650> guess

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:29.009 
a fifth position spot which is I guess

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:31.040 
a fifth position spot which is I guess
it<00:04:29.400> kind<00:04:29.789> of<00:04:29.879> affected<00:04:30.300> that<00:04:30.449> game<00:04:30.599> against<00:04:30.900> my

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050

it kind of affected that game against my
name<00:04:31.229> it<00:04:31.349> as<00:04:31.470> well<00:04:31.620> because<00:04:31.949> when<00:04:32.819> I<00:04:32.849> knew<00:04:33.120> that

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 
name it as well because when I knew that

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:34.999 
name it as well because when I knew that
I<00:04:33.419> couldn't<00:04:33.659> grab<00:04:34.139> that<00:04:34.319> when<00:04:34.620> we<00:04:34.770> couldn't

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:35.009 
I couldn't grab that when we couldn't

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:36.559 
I couldn't grab that when we couldn't
drop<00:04:35.129> that<00:04:35.340> fits<00:04:35.550> position<00:04:35.909> spot<00:04:36.150> it<00:04:36.240> kind<00:04:36.449> of

drop that fits position spot it kind of

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:38.570 
drop that fits position spot it kind of
put<00:04:37.110> me<00:04:37.139> in<00:04:37.319> the<00:04:37.379> bad<00:04:37.560> spirit<00:04:37.949> and<00:04:38.099> I<00:04:38.219> just<00:04:38.370> felt
