here<00:00:04.410> to<00:00:04.680> do<00:00:04.830> the<00:00:04.859> introductory<00:00:06.470> VHF<00:00:07.470> radio

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
here to do the introductory VHF radio

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.900 
here to do the introductory VHF radio
lesson<00:00:08.639> on<00:00:08.849> how<00:00:09.360> to<00:00:09.420> turn<00:00:09.809> on<00:00:10.170> the<00:00:10.349> radio<00:00:10.910> set

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
lesson on how to turn on the radio set

lesson on how to turn on the radio set
the<00:00:12.059> squelch<00:00:12.360> and<00:00:12.750> make<00:00:13.320> a<00:00:13.590> basic<00:00:13.920> call<00:00:14.509> so<00:00:15.590> the

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
the squelch and make a basic call so the

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.680 
the squelch and make a basic call so the
first<00:00:16.859> thing<00:00:17.130> is<00:00:17.400> that<00:00:17.940> you<00:00:18.240> have<00:00:18.420> to<00:00:18.539> make

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
first thing is that you have to make

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.720 
first thing is that you have to make
sure<00:00:18.990> that<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.590> circuit<00:00:19.890> breaker<00:00:20.279> on<00:00:20.550> the

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
sure that the circuit breaker on the

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.320 
sure that the circuit breaker on the
electrical<00:00:21.330> panel<00:00:21.539> is<00:00:21.900> turned<00:00:22.680> on<00:00:22.980> so<00:00:23.910> you<00:00:23.970> go

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
electrical panel is turned on so you go

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.929 
electrical panel is turned on so you go
down<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.990> list<00:00:25.170> until<00:00:25.470> you<00:00:25.650> find<00:00:25.740> VHF<00:00:26.519> radio

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
down the list until you find VHF radio

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.540 
down the list until you find VHF radio
and<00:00:27.240> then<00:00:28.050> this<00:00:28.230> one<00:00:28.439> is<00:00:28.590> off<00:00:28.769> so<00:00:29.039> I<00:00:29.070> switch<00:00:29.400> it

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
and then this one is off so I switch it

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.179 
and then this one is off so I switch it
to<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.699> on<00:00:29.939> button<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.750> red<00:00:31.439> light<00:00:31.679> appears

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
to the on button a red light appears

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.250 
to the on button a red light appears
indicating<00:00:32.579> that<00:00:33.030> there<00:00:33.360> is<00:00:33.390> power<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.989> the

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
indicating that there is power to the

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.479 
indicating that there is power to the
radio<00:00:34.620> I<00:00:35.630> then<00:00:36.630> switch<00:00:37.020> on<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.739> power<00:00:38.160> button

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
radio I then switch on the power button

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.970 
radio I then switch on the power button
on<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:39.030> radio<00:00:41.030> it's<00:00:42.030> set<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.629> channel<00:00:42.840> 68<00:00:43.680> at

on the radio it's set to channel 68 at

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.880 
on the radio it's set to channel 68 at
the<00:00:44.160> moment<00:00:44.780> normally<00:00:45.780> it's<00:00:46.110> set<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.649> channel

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
the moment normally it's set to channel

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.190 
the moment normally it's set to channel
16<00:00:47.640> which<00:00:47.910> is<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.090> International<00:00:48.930> distress

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
16 which is the International distress

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.830 
16 which is the International distress
and<00:00:49.649> calling<00:00:50.340> frequency<00:00:51.149> if<00:00:51.420> we<00:00:51.570> could<00:00:51.719> see

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
and calling frequency if we could see

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.470 
and calling frequency if we could see
that's<00:00:52.050> used<00:00:52.350> for<00:00:52.590> calling<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.940> Coast<00:00:54.180> Guard

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
that's used for calling the Coast Guard

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.299 
that's used for calling the Coast Guard
and<00:00:54.719> calling<00:00:55.050> other<00:00:55.199> vessels<00:00:55.710> before<00:00:55.980> you

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
and calling other vessels before you

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.290 
and calling other vessels before you
switch<00:00:56.610> them<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.090> talking<00:00:57.539> frequency<00:00:59.300> what

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
switch them to a talking frequency what

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.900 
switch them to a talking frequency what
you<00:01:00.480> need<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.809> do<00:01:00.989> is<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.949> make<00:01:02.340> sure<00:01:02.370> that<00:01:02.579> the

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
you need to do is to make sure that the

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.500 
you need to do is to make sure that the
volume<00:01:03.300> is<00:01:03.559> set<00:01:04.559> at<00:01:04.830> an<00:01:05.040> appropriate<00:01:05.280> level<00:01:05.760> so

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
volume is set at an appropriate level so

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.200 
volume is set at an appropriate level so
in<00:01:06.630> this<00:01:06.750> case<00:01:07.020> I've<00:01:07.260> got<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.530> set<00:01:07.799> at<00:01:08.180> about<00:01:09.180> a

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
in this case I've got it set at about a

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.700 
in this case I've got it set at about a
third<00:01:09.630> of<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.960> way<00:01:10.110> up<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:11.630> yeah<00:01:12.630> you<00:01:13.439> take

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
third of the way up and yeah you take

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.550 
third of the way up and yeah you take
the<00:01:13.740> squelch<00:01:14.280> button<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.540> squelch<00:01:15.960> is<00:01:16.350> the

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
the squelch button the squelch is the

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.420 
the squelch button the squelch is the
radio<00:01:17.009> interference<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.939> you<00:01:18.540> turn<00:01:18.900> it

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
radio interference and you turn it

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.090 
radio interference and you turn it
square<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.939> then<00:01:21.600> you<00:01:21.810> rotate<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.799> button

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
square and then you rotate the button

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.580 
square and then you rotate the button
until<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.490> squelch<00:01:23.880> just<00:01:24.689> disappears<00:01:25.350> like

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
until the squelch just disappears like

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.010 
until the squelch just disappears like
that<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.189> that<00:01:26.460> always<00:01:27.180> should<00:01:27.420> be<00:01:27.450> done<00:01:27.780> when

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
that and that always should be done when

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.630 
that and that always should be done when
you<00:01:28.049> turn<00:01:28.409> on<00:01:28.439> your<00:01:28.680> radio<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.250> set<00:01:29.490> your

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
you turn on your radio and set your

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.350 
you turn on your radio and set your
radio<00:01:30.049> again<00:01:31.049> turn<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.829> turn<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.939> knob<00:01:33.119> until

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
radio again turn the turn the knob until

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.300 
radio again turn the turn the knob until
you<00:01:33.630> get<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.960> squelch<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.590> then<00:01:34.799> rotate<00:01:35.189> it

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
you get the squelch and then rotate it

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.899 
you get the squelch and then rotate it
slowly<00:01:35.610> until<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.150> square<00:01:37.430> there<00:01:38.430> you<00:01:38.549> go<00:01:38.700> the

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
slowly until the square there you go the

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.230 
slowly until the square there you go the
squelch<00:01:39.180> disappears<00:01:39.869> in<00:01:40.200> this<00:01:41.070> case<00:01:41.340> I<00:01:41.790> have

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
squelch disappears in this case I have
