00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
now for my short arm people I've had a

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.110 
now for my short arm people I've had a
lot<00:02:27.140> of<00:02:27.170> concerns<00:02:28.010> about<00:02:28.220> Darnell<00:02:28.670> because

we've had a hard time wrapping and I

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.900 
we've had a hard time wrapping and I
think<00:02:32.750> that<00:02:33.319> this<00:02:33.680> will<00:02:33.950> be<00:02:34.100> probably<00:02:34.819> the

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
think that this will be probably the

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.910 
think that this will be probably the
easiest<00:02:35.480> way<00:02:35.810> for<00:02:35.840> you<00:02:36.350> to<00:02:36.530> get<00:02:36.680> into<00:02:36.799> your
