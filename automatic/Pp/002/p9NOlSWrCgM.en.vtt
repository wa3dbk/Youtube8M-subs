00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.149 
like the second last one I wanted to do
is<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.290> can<00:01:49.409> bring<00:01:49.590> up<00:01:49.770> these<00:01:49.860> four

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
is you can bring up these four

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.249 
is you can bring up these four
categories<00:01:50.310> okay<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.329> then<00:01:51.689> I<00:01:51.930> don't<00:01:52.140> think

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
categories okay and then I don't think

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.310 
categories okay and then I don't think
it<00:01:52.350> video<00:01:52.740> is<00:01:52.979> allowed<00:01:53.610> activated<00:01:54.570> in<00:01:54.720> you<00:01:55.079> or

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
it video is allowed activated in you or

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.209 
it video is allowed activated in you or
certainly<00:01:55.920> not<00:01:56.159> in<00:01:56.189> Ireland<00:01:56.759> anyway<00:01:57.200> so<00:01:58.219> the

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
certainly not in Ireland anyway so the

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.179 
certainly not in Ireland anyway so the
main<00:01:59.640> one<00:01:59.850> you<00:01:59.939> want<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.149> pick<00:02:00.390> is<00:02:00.689> gay<00:02:01.170> so<00:02:01.950> when

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
main one you want to pick is gay so when

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.020 
main one you want to pick is gay so when
you<00:02:02.250> click<00:02:02.369> game<00:02:02.640> there<00:02:02.820> should<00:02:02.909> be<00:02:03.000> a

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
you click game there should be a

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.179 
you click game there should be a
drop-down<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.780> as<00:02:04.409> you<00:02:04.500> can<00:02:04.649> see<00:02:04.680> you<00:02:05.040> have

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
drop-down and as you can see you have

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.920 
drop-down and as you can see you have
deactivated<00:02:05.460> your<00:02:05.820> devices<00:02:06.360> recently<00:02:06.750> and

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
deactivated your devices recently and

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.240 
deactivated your devices recently and
cannot<00:02:07.110> use<00:02:07.350> this<00:02:07.500> feature<00:02:07.680> at<00:02:07.920> this<00:02:08.069> time

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
cannot use this feature at this time

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.390 
cannot use this feature at this time
okay<00:02:08.879> so<00:02:08.940> basically<00:02:09.660> what<00:02:10.379> will<00:02:10.590> happen<00:02:10.950> is<00:02:11.099> in

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
okay so basically what will happen is in

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.880 
okay so basically what will happen is in
your<00:02:11.670> case<00:02:11.910> if<00:02:12.239> you<00:02:12.569> have

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
your case if you have
