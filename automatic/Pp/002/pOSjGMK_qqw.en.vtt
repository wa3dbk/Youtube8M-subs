00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
think I called him fire cracking in the

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.109 
think I called him fire cracking in the
last<00:00:19.680> one<00:00:19.859> I<00:00:19.920> can't<00:00:20.160> get<00:00:20.250> him<00:00:20.369> mixed<00:00:20.550> up<00:00:20.850> since

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
last one I can't get him mixed up since

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.029 
last one I can't get him mixed up since
we<00:00:21.210> did<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.449> little<00:00:21.600> swapping<00:00:22.500> here<00:00:22.769> but<00:00:22.920> in

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
we did the little swapping here but in

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.130 
we did the little swapping here but in
his<00:00:23.220> last<00:00:23.430> bike<00:00:23.820> he<00:00:24.180> actually<00:00:24.510> did<00:00:24.689> really

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
his last bike he actually did really

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.050 
his last bike he actually did really
good<00:00:25.439> yeah<00:00:25.800> he<00:00:25.920> did<00:00:26.099> really<00:00:26.340> good<00:00:26.490> on<00:00:26.670> my<00:00:26.849> last

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
good yeah he did really good on my last

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.630 
good yeah he did really good on my last
funny<00:00:27.420> I<00:00:28.019> think<00:00:28.170> it<00:00:28.289> was<00:00:28.410> kind<00:00:28.590> of<00:00:28.619> unequal<00:00:29.189> and

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
funny I think it was kind of unequal and

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.849 
funny I think it was kind of unequal and
then<00:00:30.150> right<00:00:30.359> here<00:00:30.660> we<00:00:30.869> ride<00:00:31.109> that<00:00:31.349> wave<00:00:31.529> either

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
then right here we ride that wave either

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.920 
then right here we ride that wave either
way<00:00:32.009> your<00:00:32.640> own<00:00:32.820> rattle<00:00:33.300> crack<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:33.690> that's<00:00:33.809> why

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
way your own rattle crack and that's why

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.229 
way your own rattle crack and that's why
we<00:00:34.079> got<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.230> mixed<00:00:34.620> up<00:00:34.800> that's<00:00:35.130> that's<00:00:35.910> what<00:00:36.120> we

got going over there who's gonna win

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.780 
got going over there who's gonna win
this<00:00:39.570> one<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:40.739> know<00:00:40.860> that<00:00:41.070> this<00:00:41.460> one's<00:00:41.670> gonna

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
this one you know that this one's gonna

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:42.799 
this one you know that this one's gonna
be<00:00:41.879> you<00:00:42.000> know<00:00:42.090> I<00:00:42.120> think<00:00:42.329> this<00:00:42.480> one's<00:00:42.629> gonna<00:00:42.719> be

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
be you know I think this one's gonna be

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.240 
be you know I think this one's gonna be
a<00:00:42.899> close<00:00:43.050> fight<00:00:43.379> so<00:00:43.829> I<00:00:43.890> don't<00:00:44.100> have<00:00:44.219> a

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
a close fight so I don't have a

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.220 
a close fight so I don't have a
prediction<00:00:44.520> on<00:00:44.940> this<00:00:45.149> one<00:00:45.360> some<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:45.930> these<00:00:46.020> out

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
prediction on this one some of these out

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.290 
prediction on this one some of these out
with<00:00:46.440> it's<00:00:47.010> so<00:00:47.219> hard<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.579> predict<00:00:48.059> because

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
with it's so hard to predict because

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.119 
with it's so hard to predict because
when<00:00:48.719> they're<00:00:48.899> upgraded<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.800> they're<00:00:49.890> new

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
when they're upgraded and they're new

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.950 
when they're upgraded and they're new
and<00:00:50.340> Yemen<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:50.789> hate<00:00:51.030> your<00:00:51.180> swapping<00:00:51.780> and

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
and Yemen you hate your swapping and

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.010 
and Yemen you hate your swapping and
your<00:00:52.260> swapping<00:00:52.770> them<00:00:53.690> anything<00:00:54.690> can<00:00:54.840> happen

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
your swapping them anything can happen

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.970 
your swapping them anything can happen
so<00:00:56.000> here<00:00:57.000> I<00:00:57.030> go<00:00:57.420> it's<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.170> fire<00:00:58.440> characters

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
so here I go it's the to fire characters

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.279 
so here I go it's the to fire characters
on<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.370> fire<00:00:59.609> stage<00:01:00.090> so<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:00.750> know<00:01:01.079> I<00:01:01.140> don't

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
on the fire stage so you know I don't

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.959
