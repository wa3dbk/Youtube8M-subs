their layers tree open up their switch

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.089 
their layers tree open up their switch
layer<00:01:26.459> and<00:01:26.759> then<00:01:27.509> left-click<00:01:28.050> on<00:01:28.530> something

like<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.390> fist<00:01:30.840> outside<00:01:31.289> and<00:01:31.560> they<00:01:32.369> think

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
like the fist outside and they think

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.070 
like the fist outside and they think
that<00:01:32.729> that<00:01:32.880> will<00:01:33.090> make<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.420> change<00:01:33.660> as<00:01:33.959> you

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
that that will make the change as you

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.650 
that that will make the change as you
can<00:01:34.259> see<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:35.280> hand<00:01:35.580> has<00:01:35.789> changed<00:01:36.330> and<00:01:36.539> it's

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:36.660 
can see the hand has changed and it's

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:42.080 
can see the hand has changed and it's
now<00:01:36.810> showing<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.560> fist<00:01:39.739> the<00:01:40.739> problem<00:01:41.429> is<00:01:41.670> if

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
now showing the fist the problem is if

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.850 
now showing the fist the problem is if
you<00:01:42.509> come<00:01:42.720> down<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.080> timeline<00:01:43.319> you'll<00:01:43.679> see

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
you come down to the timeline you'll see

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.639 
you come down to the timeline you'll see
that<00:01:44.009> there's<00:01:44.220> no<00:01:44.399> dot<00:01:44.819> placed<00:01:45.810> down<00:01:46.200> here<00:01:46.560> in

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
that there's no dot placed down here in

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.520 
that there's no dot placed down here in
the<00:01:46.739> timeline<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.670> dot<00:01:48.119> would<00:01:48.539> be<00:01:48.720> the

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
the timeline that dot would be the

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.559 
the timeline that dot would be the
indication<00:01:50.340> that<00:01:50.369> your<00:01:50.819> keyframe<00:01:51.360> has

00:01:51.559 --> 00:01:51.569 
indication that your keyframe has

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:55.219 
indication that your keyframe has
changed<00:01:52.550> so<00:01:53.550> the<00:01:53.759> way<00:01:53.940> to<00:01:53.970> actually<00:01:54.330> set<00:01:54.959> that

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
changed so the way to actually set that

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.270 
changed so the way to actually set that
so<00:01:55.619> that<00:01:55.800> it<00:01:55.920> sticks<00:01:56.660> come<00:01:57.660> over<00:01:57.899> here<00:01:58.280> instead

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
so that it sticks come over here instead

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.889

of clicking on one of these layers

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.790 
of clicking on one of these layers
that's<00:02:01.649> in<00:02:01.979> your<00:02:02.160> switch<00:02:02.369> layer<00:02:02.610> actually

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
that's in your switch layer actually

make a keyframe change you'll notice

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:46.629 
make a keyframe change you'll notice
that<00:02:44.060> there<00:02:44.239> will<00:02:44.329> be<00:02:45.010> something<00:02:46.010> to<00:02:46.250> indicate

what the change was made to in this case
it's<00:02:48.950> the<00:02:49.069> switch<00:02:49.310> layer<00:02:49.519> there's<00:02:50.239> another

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
it's the switch layer there's another

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.689 
it's the switch layer there's another
way<00:02:50.750> to<00:02:50.780> do<00:02:50.989> this<00:02:51.200> I'll<00:02:51.739> go<00:02:51.799> to<00:02:51.980> frame<00:02:52.159> 30<00:02:52.430> and

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:52.699 
way to do this I'll go to frame 30 and

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:57.189 
way to do this I'll go to frame 30 and
show<00:02:52.879> you<00:02:54.159> if<00:02:55.159> I<00:02:55.849> came<00:02:55.909> over<00:02:56.209> here<00:02:56.299> and<00:02:56.540> left

show you if I came over here and left
clicked<00:02:57.590> on<00:02:57.829> my<00:02:57.889> switch<00:02:58.609> layer<00:02:58.879> to<00:02:59.090> highlight

00:02:59.379 --> 00:02:59.389 
clicked on my switch layer to highlight

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:02.409 
clicked on my switch layer to highlight
it<00:02:59.840> then<00:03:00.019> I<00:03:00.889> can<00:03:01.069> come<00:03:01.250> over<00:03:01.400> to<00:03:01.639> my<00:03:01.669> layers<00:03:02.060> tab

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:02.419 
it then I can come over to my layers tab

it then I can come over to my layers tab
click<00:03:03.260> my<00:03:03.500> switch<00:03:03.919> layer<00:03:04.189> layer<00:03:06.370> come<00:03:07.370> up<00:03:07.489> here

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:07.669 
click my switch layer layer come up here

00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:09.459 
click my switch layer layer come up here
to<00:03:07.790> where<00:03:07.879> it<00:03:07.939> says<00:03:08.030> active<00:03:08.599> child<00:03:08.810> now<00:03:09.139> we<00:03:09.199> can

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:09.469 
to where it says active child now we can

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:12.159 
to where it says active child now we can
set<00:03:09.709> a<00:03:09.739> keyframe<00:03:10.069> by<00:03:10.760> selecting<00:03:11.359> our<00:03:11.510> child<00:03:11.780> in

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:12.169 
set a keyframe by selecting our child in

00:03:12.169 --> 00:03:18.640 
set a keyframe by selecting our child in
here<00:03:13.040> so<00:03:13.819> if<00:03:14.389> we<00:03:14.719> go<00:03:14.900> to<00:03:16.989> left-click<00:03:17.989> facing

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
here so if we go to left-click facing

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.530 
here so if we go to left-click facing
thumb<00:03:18.889> we've<00:03:19.310> now<00:03:19.489> changed<00:03:19.519> the<00:03:20.000> hand<00:03:20.209> again

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
thumb we've now changed the hand again

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.210 
thumb we've now changed the hand again
and<00:03:20.810> you'll<00:03:21.470> see<00:03:21.530> that<00:03:21.829> there's<00:03:22.040> a

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
and you'll see that there's a

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.830 
and you'll see that there's a
corresponding<00:03:22.879> keyframe<00:03:23.269> change<00:03:23.569> down<00:03:23.780> here

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
corresponding keyframe change down here

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.649 
corresponding keyframe change down here
in<00:03:24.049> the<00:03:24.139> timeline<00:03:24.379> so<00:03:24.909> that's<00:03:25.909> it<00:03:26.209> it's<00:03:26.479> that

00:03:26.649 --> 00:03:26.659 
in the timeline so that's it it's that

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:29.619 
in the timeline so that's it it's that
simple<00:03:26.900> oh<00:03:27.790> by<00:03:28.790> the<00:03:28.819> way<00:03:28.939> why<00:03:29.239> would<00:03:29.449> this<00:03:29.569> be

00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:29.629 
simple oh by the way why would this be

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:32.170 
simple oh by the way why would this be
important<00:03:30.259> as<00:03:30.439> you<00:03:31.189> can<00:03:31.370> see<00:03:31.609> because<00:03:32.060> it

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
important as you can see because it

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.789 
important as you can see because it
happens<00:03:32.629> to<00:03:32.689> be<00:03:32.780> a<00:03:32.870> little<00:03:33.019> bit<00:03:33.169> more<00:03:33.290> work<00:03:33.530> as

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
happens to be a little bit more work as

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:36.219 
happens to be a little bit more work as
you<00:03:33.949> can<00:03:34.099> see<00:03:34.280> though<00:03:34.519> I<00:03:34.759> have<00:03:35.509> like<00:03:35.720> I<00:03:35.989> don't

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:36.229 
you can see though I have like I don't

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:38.640 
you can see though I have like I don't
know<00:03:36.439> 34<00:03:37.009> different<00:03:37.430> layers<00:03:37.669> for<00:03:38.060> my<00:03:38.180> hands

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
know 34 different layers for my hands

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.800 
know 34 different layers for my hands
when<00:03:39.650> I<00:03:39.680> get<00:03:39.859> something<00:03:40.189> that's<00:03:40.370> that<00:03:40.579> long<00:03:40.879> if

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
when I get something that's that long if

I were to try to set it over here there
are<00:03:44.180> times<00:03:44.389> when<00:03:44.599> it<00:03:44.689> actually<00:03:44.840> falls<00:03:45.259> off<00:03:45.590> the

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
are times when it actually falls off the
