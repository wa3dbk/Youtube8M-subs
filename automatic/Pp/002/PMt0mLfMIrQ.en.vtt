it's not any adhesive it's just water
the<00:02:18.580> purpose<00:02:18.940> is<00:02:19.240> to<00:02:20.310> flatten<00:02:21.310> it<00:02:21.430> a<00:02:21.489> little

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
the purpose is to flatten it a little

the purpose is to flatten it a little
bit

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.330 

remember<00:02:34.760> the<00:02:34.940> mounting<00:02:35.450> function<00:02:36.440> is<00:02:36.740> not

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
remember the mounting function is not

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.910 
remember the mounting function is not
only<00:02:37.610> to<00:02:38.030> flatten<00:02:38.540> but<00:02:38.840> others<00:02:39.200> stiffening<00:02:39.740> it

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
only to flatten but others stiffening it

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.480 
only to flatten but others stiffening it
with<00:02:40.280> a<00:02:40.870> backing<00:02:41.870> paper<00:02:42.130> so<00:02:43.130> now<00:02:43.160> it's

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
with a backing paper so now it's

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:50.430 
with a backing paper so now it's
fattened<00:02:44.060> I<00:02:47.770> okay<00:02:48.770> put<00:02:49.100> another<00:02:49.490> it's<00:02:49.910> a<00:02:50.060> clean

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
fattened I okay put another it's a clean

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.310 
fattened I okay put another it's a clean
piece<00:02:51.440> of<00:02:51.820> used<00:02:52.820> silicone<00:02:53.360> release<00:02:53.959> paper

without<00:02:54.560> the<00:02:55.209> silicone<00:02:56.770> adhesive<00:02:57.770> I<00:02:58.010> use<00:02:58.489> as<00:02:58.700> a

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
without the silicone adhesive I use as a

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.110 
without the silicone adhesive I use as a
protecting<00:03:00.380> paper<00:03:00.709> and<00:03:01.370> on<00:03:01.550> this<00:03:01.790> is<00:03:01.940> the

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
protecting paper and on this is the

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:08.830 
protecting paper and on this is the
heavy<00:03:02.420> with<00:03:03.069> silicone<00:03:04.069> on<00:03:04.220> it<00:03:04.400> I<00:03:07.540> touch<00:03:08.540> the

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
heavy with silicone on it I touch the

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.210 
heavy with silicone on it I touch the
paper<00:03:09.640> to<00:03:10.640> the<00:03:10.760> size<00:03:10.790> I<00:03:11.330> want

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
paper to the size I want

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:21.780 
paper to the size I want
roughly<00:03:17.470> should<00:03:18.470> be<00:03:18.650> a<00:03:18.680> little<00:03:18.920> bit<00:03:19.120> bigger

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
roughly should be a little bit bigger

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:29.440 
roughly should be a little bit bigger
and<00:03:25.600> now<00:03:26.600> the<00:03:26.660> adhesive<00:03:27.650> side<00:03:28.010> is<00:03:28.519> facing<00:03:29.030> the

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
and now the adhesive side is facing the

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:55.790 
and now the adhesive side is facing the
wrong<00:03:29.720> side<00:03:30.019> of<00:03:30.260> the<00:03:30.820> original<00:03:33.250> and<00:03:34.250> I<00:03:34.340> just<00:03:34.610> I

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.200 

about<00:03:56.790> 20<00:03:57.180> seconds<00:03:57.570> I<00:03:58.610> sent<00:03:59.610> a<00:03:59.730> tempering

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:00.210 
about 20 seconds I sent a tempering
