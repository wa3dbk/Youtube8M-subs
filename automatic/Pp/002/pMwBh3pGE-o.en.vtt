takes up very little space the actual

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.789 
takes up very little space the actual
cases<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.780> know<00:01:24.869> really<00:01:25.170> compact<00:01:25.560> look<00:01:25.680> how

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
little space that takes up so I think

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.240
