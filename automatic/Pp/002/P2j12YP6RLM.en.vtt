00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:07.469 
you're trying to take a self shot so

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:10.529 
you're trying to take a self shot so
anyway<00:01:08.469> what<00:01:08.679> this<00:01:08.859> does<00:01:09.130> you<00:01:09.850> can<00:01:10.030> adjust<00:01:10.149> it

00:01:10.529 --> 00:01:10.539 
anyway what this does you can adjust it

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:13.349 
anyway what this does you can adjust it
like<00:01:10.689> this<00:01:11.700> maybe<00:01:12.700> like<00:01:12.880> that<00:01:13.119> right<00:01:13.299> there

00:01:13.349 --> 00:01:13.359 
like this maybe like that right there

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:15.929 
like this maybe like that right there
tighten<00:01:14.200> it<00:01:14.259> up<00:01:14.350> a<00:01:14.499> little<00:01:14.619> and<00:01:15.100> you<00:01:15.789> don't

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:15.939 
tighten it up a little and you don't

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:18.239 
tighten it up a little and you don't
have<00:01:16.030> your<00:01:16.119> arm<00:01:16.299> in<00:01:16.450> the<00:01:16.570> shot<00:01:16.780> anymore<00:01:17.200> so<00:01:17.560> you

00:01:18.239 --> 00:01:18.249 
have your arm in the shot anymore so you

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:22.800 
have your arm in the shot anymore so you
get<00:01:18.429> a<00:01:18.539> nice<00:01:19.539> distance<00:01:20.159> with<00:01:21.159> the<00:01:21.280> camera<00:01:21.810> you

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
get a nice distance with the camera you

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.539 
get a nice distance with the camera you
can<00:01:22.960> follow<00:01:23.170> yourself<00:01:23.590> around<00:01:23.799> with<00:01:24.039> it<00:01:24.249> so

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:24.549 
can follow yourself around with it so

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:28.200 
can follow yourself around with it so
it's<00:01:25.289> pretty<00:01:26.289> decent<00:01:26.619> for<00:01:26.920> taking<00:01:27.819> selfshots

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
it's pretty decent for taking selfshots

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.989 
it's pretty decent for taking selfshots
doing<00:01:28.869> videos<00:01:29.229> of<00:01:29.409> yourself<00:01:29.850> gives<00:01:30.850> you<00:01:30.939> a

00:01:30.989 --> 00:01:30.999 
doing videos of yourself gives you a

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:34.260 
doing videos of yourself gives you a
little<00:01:31.149> bit<00:01:31.329> more<00:01:31.509> depth<00:01:31.869> low<00:01:32.530> I<00:01:33.189> guess<00:01:34.090> a

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
little bit more depth low I guess a

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.410 
little bit more depth low I guess a
broader<00:01:34.659> range<00:01:34.929> of<00:01:36.929> video<00:01:37.929> or<00:01:38.229> still<00:01:38.920> photo

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
broader range of video or still photo

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.169 
broader range of video or still photo
opportunities<00:01:40.420> and<00:01:40.719> possibilities<00:01:41.380> so

00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:42.179 
opportunities and possibilities so

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:45.179 
opportunities and possibilities so
anyway<00:01:43.179> I<00:01:43.359> really<00:01:44.109> like<00:01:44.439> it<00:01:44.649> and<00:01:44.770> I<00:01:44.859> was<00:01:44.950> kind

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:45.189 
anyway I really like it and I was kind

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:47.940 
anyway I really like it and I was kind
of<00:01:45.219> excited<00:01:45.520> to<00:01:45.700> get<00:01:45.969> it<00:01:46.179> and<00:01:46.590> they<00:01:47.590> actually

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
of excited to get it and they actually

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.679 
of excited to get it and they actually
have<00:01:48.130> an<00:01:48.280> affiliate<00:01:48.670> program<00:01:49.060> going<00:01:49.299> so<00:01:49.659> I

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:49.689 
have an affiliate program going so I

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:51.779 
have an affiliate program going so I
figured<00:01:50.350> why<00:01:50.649> not<00:01:50.679> review<00:01:51.310> it<00:01:51.399> and<00:01:51.490> tell<00:01:51.670> you

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:51.789 
figured why not review it and tell you

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:53.249 
figured why not review it and tell you
about<00:01:51.880> it<00:01:52.119> and<00:01:52.270> show<00:01:52.569> you<00:01:52.630> kind<00:01:52.929> of<00:01:52.990> what<00:01:53.049> it

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
about it and show you kind of what it

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:55.770 
about it and show you kind of what it
