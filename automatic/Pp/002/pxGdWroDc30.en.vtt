00:00:01.599 --> 00:00:03.500
 so for osho toskala 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.960
 for what is important here if not everything she prepared placed nine that will 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.440
 serve me in front of the n 3 who will serve me to hamon double flow 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:13.299
 so here in celebration 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:16.800
 on it we see the traces we strengthened the whole party 

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:21.269
 here at the level of the legs 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:23.300
 and also at the level of the windshield 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.300
 why not give it reinforcement 

00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:28.399
 superior resistance 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:31.629
 but if it's a bit like a roll bar the bell under a car 

00:00:31.629 --> 00:00:35.510
 its control just to strengthen the bodywork from the inside so we go 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:36.950
 see how we do 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.090
 it ensures the future 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.180
 lw disassemble with princess on bnl 3 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.700
 so here 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.500
 thousands of disks were pretending to simulate it's a precaution that is 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.430
 no one because the road is ump one is always on the fingers 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.070
 so France and Corsica and alsace ali so I also have a way to 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.640
 protect while we're doing 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.790
 the operation 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.820
 so what product chosen in full in the trade was a cd by its base 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.290
 toxin 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.330
 professional or other battles 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.330
 so the principle is always the same 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.210
 we put the two elements 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.200
 the dough is ready we can start to coat 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.020
 the support part 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.020
 then at the budget level before 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.960
 and therefore the coating we 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.990
 windshield 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.710
 one of the inner panes 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.710
 ok no technicality it does not take much time 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.170
 products in a speech product 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.470
 at the base of proxies 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.479
 which is in commerce 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.479
 well there ended in the rain with 5 five ten minutes 

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:16.709
 so I am a partouche friend sure the train the front part front bumper 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.279
 rear bumper 

00:02:18.279 --> 00:02:20.369
 all around ie6 

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:22.419
 the windshields 

00:02:22.419 --> 00:02:25.419
 giant the mounting brackets making sure 

00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:30.399
 on this part scratch well for small shells immediately 

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:32.730
 come from tosca and the rule of the strong 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:33.980
 they are suspected of here
