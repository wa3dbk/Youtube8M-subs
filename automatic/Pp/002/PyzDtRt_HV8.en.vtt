00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
the shade 240 and I picked this up this

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.080 
the shade 240 and I picked this up this
is<00:00:42.650> the<00:00:42.860> natural<00:00:43.280> one<00:00:43.400> they<00:00:43.550> did<00:00:43.730> have<00:00:43.940> one<00:00:44.060> a

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
is the natural one they did have one a

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.260 
is the natural one they did have one a
little<00:00:44.450> bit<00:00:44.600> darker<00:00:44.990> however<00:00:45.830> I<00:00:46.460> did<00:00:46.910> try<00:00:47.240> it

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
little bit darker however I did try it

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.800 
little bit darker however I did try it
this<00:00:48.130> was<00:00:49.130> actually<00:00:49.550> too<00:00:49.730> light<00:00:50.000> for<00:00:50.030> my<00:00:50.390> skin

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:50.810 
this was actually too light for my skin

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:52.720 
this was actually too light for my skin
because<00:00:51.590> this<00:00:51.770> yellow<00:00:52.010> color<00:00:52.280> actually

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
because this yellow color actually

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.300 
because this yellow color actually
blends<00:00:53.030> really<00:00:53.330> well<00:00:53.480> into<00:00:54.020> my<00:00:54.050> skin<00:00:54.500> so<00:00:54.830> it

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:55.310 
blends really well into my skin so it

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.040 
blends really well into my skin so it
just<00:00:55.580> made<00:00:55.730> me<00:00:55.850> kind<00:00:56.000> of<00:00:56.120> like<00:00:56.270> yellowy<00:00:56.630> which

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
just made me kind of like yellowy which

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.420 
just made me kind of like yellowy which
I<00:00:57.200> didn't<00:00:57.410> really<00:00:57.500> like<00:00:57.770> so<00:00:57.950> I<00:00:58.010> might<00:00:58.250> actually

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
I didn't really like so I might actually

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.330 
I didn't really like so I might actually
go<00:00:58.760> back<00:00:58.970> and<00:00:59.240> try<00:00:59.930> the<00:00:59.990> darker<00:01:00.710> one<00:01:00.920> this<00:01:01.190> is

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
go back and try the darker one this is

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:02.920 
go back and try the darker one this is
the<00:01:01.460> bronzer<00:01:01.850> itself<00:01:02.210> and<00:01:02.390> this<00:01:02.480> is<00:01:02.540> what<00:01:02.810> it

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
the bronzer itself and this is what it

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.780 
the bronzer itself and this is what it
looks<00:01:03.110> like<00:01:03.200> outside<00:01:03.500> of<00:01:03.740> the<00:01:03.950> packaging<00:01:04.549> it's

the shade is pretty pigmented but it is
kind<00:01:28.670> of<00:01:28.760> powdery<00:01:29.440> just<00:01:30.440> because<00:01:30.830> it<00:01:31.100> is<00:01:31.250> all

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
kind of powdery just because it is all

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.840 
kind of powdery just because it is all
natural<00:01:31.790> organic<00:01:32.420> products<00:01:33.170> and<00:01:33.729> you<00:01:34.729> know

natural organic products and you know

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.600 
natural organic products and you know
it's<00:01:35.000> fairly<00:01:35.270> smooth<00:01:36.229> application<00:01:36.650> but<00:01:37.460> like

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
it's fairly smooth application but like

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.460 
it's fairly smooth application but like
I<00:01:37.760> said<00:01:37.820> the<00:01:38.120> color<00:01:38.299> was<00:01:38.690> just<00:01:38.960> too<00:01:39.200> light<00:01:39.440> for

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
I said the color was just too light for

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.060 
I said the color was just too light for
me<00:01:39.920> I<00:01:40.670> mainly<00:01:41.240> try<00:01:41.659> to<00:01:41.720> dab<00:01:42.020> my<00:01:42.200> brush<00:01:42.470> in<00:01:42.680> these

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
me I mainly try to dab my brush in these

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.210 
me I mainly try to dab my brush in these
leaves<00:01:43.760> that<00:01:43.940> are<00:01:44.060> a<00:01:44.180> little<00:01:44.420> bit<00:01:44.600> darker

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
leaves that are a little bit darker

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.710 
leaves that are a little bit darker
because<00:01:46.220> those<00:01:46.430> were<00:01:46.610> the<00:01:46.729> ones<00:01:46.880> that<00:01:47.119> really

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
because those were the ones that really

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.320 
because those were the ones that really
contoured<00:01:48.320> my<00:01:48.380> skin<00:01:48.770> well<00:01:49.000> and<00:01:50.000> then<00:01:50.180> the

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
contoured my skin well and then the

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.420 
contoured my skin well and then the
other<00:01:50.360> thing<00:01:50.869> that<00:01:50.900> kind<00:01:51.830> of<00:01:51.920> threw<00:01:52.130> me<00:01:52.159> off<00:01:52.280> a

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
other thing that kind of threw me off a

a<00:01:58.729> strong<00:01:59.510> distinct<00:02:00.310> scent<00:02:01.310> to<00:02:01.460> it<00:02:01.490> that<00:02:01.760> I'm

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
a strong distinct scent to it that I'm

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.179 
a strong distinct scent to it that I'm
not<00:02:02.180> very<00:02:02.570> fond<00:02:03.080> of<00:02:03.290> I<00:02:03.590> don't<00:02:03.770> know<00:02:03.950> if<00:02:04.070> it's

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
not very fond of I don't know if it's

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:07.090 
not very fond of I don't know if it's
just<00:02:04.280> me<00:02:04.670> or<00:02:04.909> you<00:02:05.869> know<00:02:05.990> I<00:02:06.020> did<00:02:06.650> like<00:02:06.680> a<00:02:06.920> dig

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
just me or you know I did like a dig

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.859 
just me or you know I did like a dig
your<00:02:07.250> hands<00:02:07.430> there<00:02:07.729> were<00:02:07.820> like<00:02:08.000> soybean<00:02:08.509> and

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
your hands there were like soybean and

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.809 
your hands there were like soybean and
some<00:02:09.739> other<00:02:09.890> stuff<00:02:10.280> and<00:02:10.429> there's<00:02:10.610> some

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
some other stuff and there's some

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.089 
some other stuff and there's some
thinking<00:02:11.299> that<00:02:11.689> might<00:02:11.989> be<00:02:12.200> what<00:02:12.380> it<00:02:12.500> is<00:02:12.530> on<00:02:13.069> a

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
thinking that might be what it is on a

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.400 
thinking that might be what it is on a
scale<00:02:13.459> of<00:02:13.490> one<00:02:13.760> to<00:02:13.790> five<00:02:14.180> how<00:02:14.660> much<00:02:15.020> I<00:02:15.200> like

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
scale of one to five how much I like

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.530 
scale of one to five how much I like
this<00:02:15.650> it<00:02:15.920> would<00:02:16.040> probably<00:02:16.069> be

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
this it would probably be

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.380 
this it would probably be
between<00:02:17.750> a<00:02:17.840> three<00:02:18.140> and<00:02:18.290> a<00:02:18.319> four<00:02:19.250> I<00:02:19.310> love<00:02:20.180> the

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
between a three and a four I love the

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.809 
between a three and a four I love the
fact<00:02:20.599> that<00:02:20.719> it's<00:02:20.900> all-natural<00:02:21.049> organic<00:02:21.819> but

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
fact that it's all-natural organic but

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.059 
fact that it's all-natural organic but
like<00:02:23.299> I<00:02:23.450> said<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:23.930> color<00:02:24.109> was<00:02:24.500> just<00:02:24.739> kind<00:02:25.010> of

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
like I said the color was just kind of

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.869 
like I said the color was just kind of
light<00:02:25.280> for<00:02:25.579> me<00:02:25.730> and<00:02:26.709> it<00:02:27.709> just<00:02:27.769> had<00:02:28.549> like<00:02:28.819> a

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:28.879 
light for me and it just had like a

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:31.750 
light for me and it just had like a
weird<00:02:29.209> scent<00:02:29.689> that<00:02:29.900> I<00:02:29.959> didn't<00:02:30.439> I<00:02:30.650> don't<00:02:31.519> know<00:02:31.700> I

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
weird scent that I didn't I don't know I

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.580 
weird scent that I didn't I don't know I
just<00:02:31.969> for<00:02:32.510> some<00:02:32.689> reason<00:02:32.989> I<00:02:33.079> just<00:02:33.109> didn't

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
just for some reason I just didn't

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.289 
just for some reason I just didn't
really<00:02:33.709> like<00:02:33.980> it<00:02:34.129> as<00:02:34.250> much<00:02:34.280> it<00:02:34.760> did<00:02:34.970> not<00:02:35.090> break

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
really like it as much it did not break

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:37.270 
really like it as much it did not break
me<00:02:35.510> out<00:02:35.599> I<00:02:35.659> do<00:02:35.840> have<00:02:35.989> sensitive<00:02:36.590> skin<00:02:36.650> this<00:02:37.069> did

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
me out I do have sensitive skin this did

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.030 
me out I do have sensitive skin this did
not<00:02:37.370> break<00:02:37.579> me<00:02:37.760> out<00:02:37.790> at<00:02:38.420> all<00:02:38.659> so<00:02:38.950> you<00:02:39.950> know

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
not break me out at all so you know

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.890 
not break me out at all so you know
though<00:02:40.280> the<00:02:40.310> formulation<00:02:41.209> itself<00:02:41.599> is<00:02:41.750> really

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
though the formulation itself is really

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.990 
though the formulation itself is really
really<00:02:42.170> good<00:02:42.470> for<00:02:42.680> sensitive<00:02:42.890> skin<00:02:43.489> that

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
really good for sensitive skin that

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.550 
really good for sensitive skin that
would<00:02:44.209> be<00:02:44.389> my<00:02:44.540> first<00:02:44.689> impressions<00:02:45.200> of<00:02:45.349> the

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
would be my first impressions of the

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.310 
would be my first impressions of the
bronzer

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.320 

the<00:02:49.320> powder<00:02:49.560> has<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:50.100> same<00:02:50.370> exact<00:02:50.700> packaging

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
the powder has the same exact packaging

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.810 
the powder has the same exact packaging
as<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:51.810> bronzer<00:02:52.500> it's<00:02:52.680> just<00:02:52.920> so<00:02:53.190> cute<00:02:53.520> it's

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
as the bronzer it's just so cute it's

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.790 
as the bronzer it's just so cute it's
got<00:02:54.090> these<00:02:54.300> three<00:02:54.600> little<00:02:54.780> leaves<00:02:55.170> on<00:02:55.410> it<00:02:55.590> and

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
got these three little leaves on it and

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.280 
got these three little leaves on it and
this<00:02:56.280> lighter<00:02:56.550> color<00:02:56.670> here<00:02:57.420> this<00:02:57.690> didn't<00:02:58.080> have

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
this lighter color here this didn't have

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.620 
this lighter color here this didn't have
any<00:02:58.470> weird<00:02:58.800> scent<00:02:59.100> to<00:02:59.280> it<00:02:59.310> as<00:02:59.640> the<00:02:59.970> bronzer<00:03:00.420> did

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
any weird scent to it as the bronzer did

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.120 
any weird scent to it as the bronzer did
and<00:03:00.870> I<00:03:00.990> found<00:03:01.170> that<00:03:01.350> this<00:03:01.530> applied<00:03:01.920> really

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
and I found that this applied really

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.310 
and I found that this applied really
really<00:03:02.430> well<00:03:02.580> on<00:03:02.700> my<00:03:02.850> face<00:03:03.150> it<00:03:03.600> is<00:03:03.990> a<00:03:04.020> little

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
really well on my face it is a little

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.020 
really well on my face it is a little
bit<00:03:04.530> powdery<00:03:04.710> I<00:03:05.040> don't<00:03:05.430> know<00:03:05.490> if<00:03:05.580> you<00:03:05.670> can<00:03:05.820> tell

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
bit powdery I don't know if you can tell

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.120 
bit powdery I don't know if you can tell
but<00:03:06.060> you<00:03:06.720> can<00:03:06.930> see<00:03:07.140> like<00:03:07.350> the<00:03:07.500> powder<00:03:07.680> coming

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
but you can see like the powder coming

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.370 
but you can see like the powder coming
off<00:03:08.310> off<00:03:08.700> as<00:03:09.180> soon<00:03:09.360> as<00:03:09.480> you<00:03:09.600> dip<00:03:09.810> your<00:03:09.990> brush<00:03:10.170> in

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
off off as soon as you dip your brush in

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.580 
off off as soon as you dip your brush in
it<00:03:10.530> so<00:03:11.100> if<00:03:11.310> you<00:03:11.460> don't<00:03:11.580> like<00:03:11.930> to<00:03:12.930> powdery

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
it so if you don't like to powdery

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.010 
it so if you don't like to powdery
powders<00:03:14.490> and<00:03:14.940> does<00:03:15.210> that<00:03:15.390> make<00:03:15.540> sense

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
powders and does that make sense

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.290 
powders and does that make sense
to<00:03:16.350> powder<00:03:16.590> powders<00:03:17.040> then<00:03:17.250> you<00:03:17.430> I<00:03:17.760> don't<00:03:18.120> know

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
to powder powders then you I don't know

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.610 
to powder powders then you I don't know
if<00:03:18.330> you<00:03:18.480> would<00:03:18.600> like<00:03:18.660> this<00:03:18.960> but<00:03:19.230> you<00:03:19.440> know<00:03:19.470> to

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
if you would like this but you know to

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.200 
if you would like this but you know to
me<00:03:19.950> a<00:03:19.980> powder<00:03:20.280> is<00:03:20.430> supposed<00:03:20.670> to<00:03:20.760> be<00:03:20.820> a<00:03:20.850> little

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.210 
me a powder is supposed to be a little

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.090 
me a powder is supposed to be a little
bit<00:03:21.330> powdery<00:03:21.510> and<00:03:21.960> it<00:03:22.350> just<00:03:22.650> sets<00:03:22.890> my

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
bit powdery and it just sets my

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.970 
bit powdery and it just sets my
moisturizer<00:03:23.970> really<00:03:24.360> well<00:03:24.570> the<00:03:25.440> color<00:03:25.680> is

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
moisturizer really well the color is

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.770 
moisturizer really well the color is
fairly<00:03:27.590> like<00:03:28.640> neutral<00:03:29.640> I<00:03:29.820> mean<00:03:30.060> it's<00:03:30.450> a<00:03:30.630> little

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
fairly like neutral I mean it's a little

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.990 
fairly like neutral I mean it's a little
bit<00:03:30.990> on<00:03:31.140> the<00:03:31.260> lighter<00:03:31.470> side<00:03:31.760> comparing<00:03:32.760> this

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
bit on the lighter side comparing this

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.940 
bit on the lighter side comparing this
with<00:03:33.060> the<00:03:33.570> wet<00:03:33.750> and<00:03:33.900> wild<00:03:33.990> natural<00:03:34.470> natural

powder<00:03:35.340> that<00:03:35.970> I<00:03:36.030> just<00:03:36.390> bought<00:03:36.570> that<00:03:37.260> one<00:03:37.500> suits

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
powder that I just bought that one suits

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.950 
powder that I just bought that one suits
my<00:03:38.520> skin<00:03:38.580> tone<00:03:38.880> a<00:03:39.060> little<00:03:39.360> bit<00:03:39.450> better<00:03:39.630> but

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:39.960 
my skin tone a little bit better but

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.250 
my skin tone a little bit better but

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
day after that same thing happened and I

soybean<00:05:10.300> in<00:05:10.510> here

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
soybean in here

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.470 
soybean in here
they<00:05:11.560> all<00:05:11.890> of<00:05:12.130> these<00:05:12.310> three<00:05:12.610> products<00:05:13.060> have

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:13.480

matches my skin perfectly it blended
really<00:05:41.620> really<00:05:42.010> smoothly<00:05:42.370> and<00:05:42.790> hydrated

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 
really really smoothly and hydrated

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.420 
really really smoothly and hydrated
really<00:05:43.720> really<00:05:43.960> well<00:05:44.140> the<00:05:44.380> color<00:05:44.620> is<00:05:44.800> great<00:05:45.040> it

really really well the color is great it
just<00:05:46.150> I<00:05:46.480> wish<00:05:47.050> it<00:05:47.200> didn't<00:05:47.500> break<00:05:47.650> me<00:05:47.860> out

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:47.920 
just I wish it didn't break me out

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.090 
just I wish it didn't break me out
probably<00:05:48.430> have<00:05:48.670> to<00:05:48.820> give<00:05:49.060> this<00:05:49.480> a<00:05:49.860> three<00:05:50.860> and<00:05:51.010> a

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:51.100 
probably have to give this a three and a

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.700 
probably have to give this a three and a
half<00:05:51.280> or<00:05:51.610> four<00:05:51.940> just<00:05:52.840> because<00:05:53.170> of<00:05:53.290> the<00:05:53.350> fact<00:05:53.560> it

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:53.710 
half or four just because of the fact it

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.440 
half or four just because of the fact it
broke<00:05:53.890> me<00:05:54.040> out<00:05:54.070> if<00:05:54.340> it<00:05:54.580> didn't<00:05:55.000> break<00:05:55.150> me<00:05:55.300> out<00:05:55.390> I

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:55.450 
broke me out if it didn't break me out I

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:56.880 
broke me out if it didn't break me out I
would<00:05:55.750> probably<00:05:56.110> give<00:05:56.260> it<00:05:56.380> a<00:05:56.440> four<00:05:56.710> and<00:05:56.770> a<00:05:56.860> half

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:56.890 
would probably give it a four and a half

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:59.100 
would probably give it a four and a half
and<00:05:57.400> these<00:05:57.880> three<00:05:58.150> together<00:05:58.330> work<00:05:58.810> pretty

00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.110 
and these three together work pretty

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.010 
and these three together work pretty
well<00:05:59.230> together<00:05:59.760> the<00:06:00.760> the<00:06:01.060> only<00:06:01.270> thing<00:06:01.600> is<00:06:01.780> if

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:02.020 
well together the the only thing is if

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.800 
well together the the only thing is if
you<00:06:02.110> put<00:06:02.380> on<00:06:02.470> too<00:06:02.650> much<00:06:03.130> powder<00:06:03.520> or<00:06:03.940> I<00:06:04.570> found

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:04.810 
you put on too much powder or I found

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:07.380 
you put on too much powder or I found
that<00:06:05.020> if<00:06:05.140> I<00:06:05.260> put<00:06:05.500> on<00:06:05.620> too<00:06:05.800> much<00:06:05.830> powder<00:06:06.250> on<00:06:06.700> top

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:07.390 
that if I put on too much powder on top

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:10.290 
that if I put on too much powder on top
of<00:06:07.630> the<00:06:07.990> moisturizer<00:06:08.950> and<00:06:09.160> made<00:06:09.610> my<00:06:09.790> face<00:06:10.000> too

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:10.300
