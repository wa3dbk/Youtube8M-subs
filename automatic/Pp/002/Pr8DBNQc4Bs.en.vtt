line everybody else dropping into

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.239 
line everybody else dropping into
coverage<00:00:45.929> and<00:00:46.109> Michael<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:46.979> seem<00:00:47.159> to

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:47.249 
coverage and Michael you seem to

00:00:47.249 --> 00:00:48.799 
coverage and Michael you seem to
recognize<00:00:47.550> this<00:00:47.789> by<00:00:47.969> calling<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.389> pretty<00:00:48.569> large

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
recognize this by calling a pretty large

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.809 
recognize this by calling a pretty large
number<00:00:49.170> of<00:00:49.199> running<00:00:49.469> plays<00:00:49.620> in<00:00:49.800> fact<00:00:50.010> WSU<00:00:50.699> was

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:50.819 
number of running plays in fact WSU was

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:53.539 
number of running plays in fact WSU was
nearly<00:00:50.999> 50-50<00:00:51.749> distribution<00:00:52.170> past<00:00:52.979> run<00:00:53.309> and

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:53.549 
nearly 50-50 distribution past run and

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:55.279 
nearly 50-50 distribution past run and
so<00:00:53.699> let's<00:00:54.329> take<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.539> look<00:00:54.749> at<00:00:54.839> these<00:00:54.960> running

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
so let's take a look at these running

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.680 
so let's take a look at these running
plays<00:00:55.499> because<00:00:55.739> when<00:00:56.639> I<00:00:56.670> saw<00:00:56.940> these<00:00:57.120> unfold<00:00:57.539> in

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
plays because when I saw these unfold in

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:58.939 
plays because when I saw these unfold in
the<00:00:57.749> game<00:00:57.899> I<00:00:57.929> thought<00:00:58.260> that's<00:00:58.499> it

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
the game I thought that's it

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.559 
the game I thought that's it
that's<00:00:59.280> what<00:00:59.519> Mike<00:00:59.670> Leach<00:00:59.909> running<00:01:00.239> plays<00:01:00.420> are

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:00.569 
that's what Mike Leach running plays are

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:01.969 
that's what Mike Leach running plays are
supposed<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.870> look<00:01:01.019> like<00:01:01.079> that's<00:01:01.530> what<00:01:01.769> his

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:01.979 
supposed to look like that's what his

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:03.860 
supposed to look like that's what his
running<00:01:02.309> game<00:01:02.459> is<00:01:02.639> supposed<00:01:02.909> to<00:01:03.059> do<00:01:03.269> and<00:01:03.510> I

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
running game is supposed to do and I

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.209 
running game is supposed to do and I
wanted<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.140> break<00:01:04.290> those<00:01:04.559> down<00:01:04.589> for<00:01:05.009> you<00:01:05.100> today

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:05.219 
wanted to break those down for you today

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:07.580 
wanted to break those down for you today
they<00:01:05.820> come<00:01:06.000> in<00:01:06.149> the<00:01:06.240> third<00:01:06.450> quarter<00:01:06.719> second

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
they come in the third quarter second

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.679 
they come in the third quarter second
drive<00:01:07.770> T<00:01:08.009> Andre<00:01:08.340> Caldwell<00:01:08.579> in<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.270> backfield
