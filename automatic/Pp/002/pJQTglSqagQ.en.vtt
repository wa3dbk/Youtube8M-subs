the people behind our food to life for a
long<00:00:22.439> time<00:00:22.680> we<00:00:22.890> didn't<00:00:23.369> have<00:00:23.490> a<00:00:23.519> program<00:00:23.820> here

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
long time we didn't have a program here

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.870 
long time we didn't have a program here
in<00:00:24.330> our<00:00:24.840> industry<00:00:25.680> we<00:00:26.039> felt<00:00:26.310> like<00:00:26.369> we<00:00:26.609> didn't

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
in our industry we felt like we didn't

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.599 
in our industry we felt like we didn't
need<00:00:26.970> another<00:00:27.710> agency<00:00:28.710> or<00:00:29.010> whatever<00:00:29.310> you<00:00:29.429> want

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
need another agency or whatever you want

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.130 
need another agency or whatever you want
to<00:00:29.699> call<00:00:29.849> it<00:00:29.910> looking<00:00:30.390> over<00:00:30.510> our<00:00:30.660> shoulder

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
to call it looking over our shoulder

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.069 
to call it looking over our shoulder
telling<00:00:31.349> us<00:00:31.560> how<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.740> do<00:00:31.949> our<00:00:31.980> job<00:00:32.719> in<00:00:33.719> the

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
telling us how to do our job in the

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.100 
telling us how to do our job in the
early<00:00:34.860> 1990s<00:00:35.640> going<00:00:36.239> forward<00:00:36.480> after<00:00:36.809> that<00:00:36.930> it

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
early 1990s going forward after that it

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.900 
early 1990s going forward after that it
became<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.469> problem<00:00:38.010> as<00:00:38.160> more<00:00:38.370> people<00:00:38.520> who

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
became a problem as more people who

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.310 
became a problem as more people who
didn't<00:00:39.210> have<00:00:39.329> any<00:00:39.510> agricultural<00:00:40.110> background

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
didn't have any agricultural background

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.830 
didn't have any agricultural background
and<00:00:41.070> were<00:00:41.700> more<00:00:41.969> interested<00:00:42.570> in<00:00:42.690> the

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
and were more interested in the

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.049 
and were more interested in the
commercial<00:00:43.290> side<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:43.590> our<00:00:43.739> business<00:00:43.950> than<00:00:44.370> the

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
commercial side of our business than the

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.440 
commercial side of our business than the
farming<00:00:45.450> side<00:00:46.219> that<00:00:47.219> it<00:00:47.879> became<00:00:48.239> apparent

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
farming side that it became apparent

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.680 
farming side that it became apparent
that<00:00:48.780> we<00:00:48.960> needed<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.379> do<00:00:49.500> something<00:00:49.800> to

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
that we needed to do something to

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.450 
that we needed to do something to
provide<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.719> path<00:00:52.020> for<00:00:52.289> everybody<00:00:52.770> first<00:00:53.399> of

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
provide a path for everybody first of

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.029 
provide a path for everybody first of
all<00:00:53.520> understanding<00:00:54.180> sustainability<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.289> in

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
all understanding sustainability and in

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.090 
all understanding sustainability and in
a<00:00:56.070> more<00:00:56.280> practical<00:00:56.520> way<00:00:57.230> really<00:00:58.230> implementing

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
a more practical way really implementing

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.400 
a more practical way really implementing
it<00:00:59.219> on<00:00:59.789> their<00:01:00.120> farms<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.809> in<00:01:00.899> their<00:01:01.020> vineyards

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
it on their farms and in their vineyards

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.329 
it on their farms and in their vineyards
and<00:01:01.710> so<00:01:02.219> in<00:01:02.480> 1997<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.840> live<00:01:04.110> program<00:01:04.589> which<00:01:05.040> I

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
and so in 1997 the live program which I

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.149 
and so in 1997 the live program which I
helped<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.760> found<00:01:06.439> had<00:01:07.439> its<00:01:07.590> first<00:01:07.710> meetings

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
helped to found had its first meetings

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.590 
helped to found had its first meetings
on<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.430> other<00:01:08.580> end<00:01:08.729> of<00:01:08.880> our<00:01:08.970> building<00:01:09.360> here<00:01:09.510> at

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
on the other end of our building here at

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.359 
on the other end of our building here at
bethel<00:01:09.900> heights<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.409> we<00:01:10.710> drew<00:01:10.920> up<00:01:10.950> the

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
bethel heights and we drew up the

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.859 
bethel heights and we drew up the
documents<00:01:11.970> that<00:01:12.119> were<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.570> founding

mission statement and all the rest and
also<00:01:17.310> something<00:01:17.580> that's<00:01:17.729> actually<00:01:18.030> it's

also something that's actually it's

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.330 
also something that's actually it's
called<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.229> scoresheet<00:01:19.710> it's<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:20.130> positive

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
called the scoresheet it's a positive

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.850 
called the scoresheet it's a positive
point<00:01:20.850> system<00:01:21.270> that<00:01:21.780> sets<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.170> direction<00:01:22.500> for

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.899 
for low input viticulture and enology
there<00:01:31.920> are<00:01:32.009> three<00:01:32.159> principles<00:01:32.670> of<00:01:32.790> it

reducing<00:01:33.799> the<00:01:34.799> chemical<00:01:35.220> inputs<00:01:35.369> would<00:01:36.000> be

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
reducing the chemical inputs would be

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.550 
reducing the chemical inputs would be
one<00:01:36.500> the<00:01:37.500> notion<00:01:37.799> of<00:01:37.860> biodiversity<00:01:39.200> the<00:01:40.200> the

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
old Davis model that I learned in the

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.569 
old Davis model that I learned in the
1970s<00:01:42.990> was<00:01:43.170> that<00:01:43.409> you<00:01:43.560> killed<00:01:44.040> everything<00:01:44.310> out

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
1970s was that you killed everything out

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.359 
1970s was that you killed everything out
there<00:01:44.790> except<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.270> grapevines<00:01:45.950> of<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:47.070> sort<00:01:47.280> of

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
there except the grapevines of a sort of

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.120 
there except the grapevines of a sort of
a<00:01:47.430> scorched<00:01:47.820> earth<00:01:48.030> policy<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.869> that<00:01:49.619> is

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
a scorched earth policy and that is

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.060 
a scorched earth policy and that is
proven<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.729> be<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.000> very<00:01:52.070> self-defeating

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
proven to be a very self-defeating

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.889 
proven to be a very self-defeating
approach<00:01:53.909> because<00:01:54.420> there's<00:01:54.600> always<00:01:54.869> a

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
farm we realized that this whole thing

farm we realized that this whole thing

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.010 
kind of works together it

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.969 
kind of works together it
it's<00:02:07.850> an<00:02:07.970> ecosystem<00:02:08.660> that<00:02:08.690> over<00:02:09.560> inter

in<00:02:11.990> front<00:02:12.140> of<00:02:12.230> the<00:02:12.290> winery<00:02:12.620> is<00:02:12.830> important<00:02:13.430> so

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
in front of the winery is important so

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.300 
in front of the winery is important so
the<00:02:14.450> whole<00:02:14.630> farm<00:02:15.110> get<00:02:15.350> certified<00:02:15.830> here<00:02:16.160> and

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
the whole farm get certified here and

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.310 
the whole farm get certified here and
the<00:02:16.520> whole<00:02:16.670> farm<00:02:16.970> needs<00:02:17.210> to<00:02:17.450> be<00:02:17.540> farmed<00:02:17.960> in<00:02:18.200> a

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
the whole farm needs to be farmed in a

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:36.420 
the whole farm needs to be farmed in a
sustainable<00:02:18.980> way

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.430 

ah
