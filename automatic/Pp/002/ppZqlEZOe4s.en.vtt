the turbo X and then we have the the
turbo<00:01:20.880> so<00:01:21.420> what<00:01:21.600> changes<00:01:21.930> from<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.229> turbo<00:01:22.500> s

s everything that made it amazing and we
scrubbed<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:28.950> down<00:01:28.979> for<00:01:29.369> price<00:01:29.640> so<00:01:29.970> we<00:01:30.450> knew

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
scrubbed it down for price so we knew

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.630 
scrubbed it down for price so we knew
that<00:01:30.630> we<00:01:30.840> couldn't<00:01:31.049> lose<00:01:31.259> any<00:01:31.590> of<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:31.950> speed

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.429 
that we couldn't lose any of that speed
and<00:01:32.939> what<00:01:33.180> it<00:01:33.270> feels<00:01:33.479> like<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.930> accelerate<00:01:34.320> on

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
and what it feels like to accelerate on

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.600 
and what it feels like to accelerate on
a<00:01:34.470> turbo<00:01:34.829> but<00:01:35.009> we<00:01:35.100> knew<00:01:35.250> there<00:01:35.430> were<00:01:35.490> some

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
a turbo but we knew there were some

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.789 
a turbo but we knew there were some
areas<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.150> we<00:01:36.270> could<00:01:36.390> save<00:01:36.600> some<00:01:36.630> cost<00:01:36.990> so<00:01:37.259> we

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
areas that we could save some cost so we

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.260 
areas that we could save some cost so we
lose<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:38.009> couple<00:01:38.189> features<00:01:38.430> we<00:01:38.820> lost

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
lose a couple features we lost

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.450 
lose a couple features we lost
regenerative<00:01:40.200> braking<00:01:40.590> so<00:01:40.829> we<00:01:41.040> don't<00:01:41.280> have

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
regenerative braking so we don't have

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.190 
regenerative braking so we don't have
automatic<00:01:42.060> regenerative<00:01:42.689> braking<00:01:42.960> on<00:01:43.049> this

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
automatic regenerative braking on this

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.870 
automatic regenerative braking on this
bike<00:01:43.380> anymore<00:01:43.649> like<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.009> do<00:01:44.189> on<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.430> turbo<00:01:44.670> s

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
bike anymore like you do on the turbo s

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.090 
bike anymore like you do on the turbo s
however<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:45.810> can<00:01:45.930> still<00:01:46.140> switch<00:01:46.409> down<00:01:46.680> into

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
however you can still switch down into

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.380 
however you can still switch down into
regen<00:01:47.369> mode<00:01:47.520> when<00:01:47.670> you're<00:01:47.790> going<00:01:47.909> down<00:01:48.149> a<00:01:48.180> hill

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
regen mode when you're going down a hill

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.480 
regen mode when you're going down a hill
we<00:01:49.110> have<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.229> little<00:01:49.500> bit<00:01:49.619> smaller<00:01:49.890> motor<00:01:50.189> and

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
we have a little bit smaller motor and

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.940 
we have a little bit smaller motor and
battery<00:01:50.640> on<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.119> bike<00:01:51.380> meaning<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.500> you

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
battery on the bike meaning that you

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.380 
battery on the bike meaning that you
have<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.130> similar<00:01:53.520> range<00:01:53.729> as<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.030> do<00:01:54.210> on<00:01:54.299> the

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
have a similar range as you do on the

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.359 
have a similar range as you do on the
turbo<00:01:54.630> s<00:01:54.780> since<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.200> motor<00:01:55.380> is<00:01:55.530> pulling<00:01:55.979> less

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
turbo s since the motor is pulling less

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.340 
turbo s since the motor is pulling less
energy<00:01:56.850> but<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.719> rider<00:01:57.899> are<00:01:58.079> gonna<00:01:58.170> be

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
energy but you the rider are gonna be

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.440 
energy but you the rider are gonna be
doing<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.649> little<00:01:58.860> bit<00:01:59.040> more<00:01:59.070> work<00:01:59.460> so<00:01:59.790> still

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
doing a little bit more work so still

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.950 
doing a little bit more work so still
you<00:02:00.659> can<00:02:00.810> do<00:02:00.960> 28<00:02:01.350> miles<00:02:01.619> per<00:02:01.799> hour<00:02:01.890> still<00:02:02.399> super

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
you can do 28 miles per hour still super

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.360 
you can do 28 miles per hour still super
fast<00:02:03.110> super<00:02:03.470> fun<00:02:03.799> but<00:02:03.979> you're<00:02:04.070> gonna<00:02:04.190> be

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:04.370 
fast super fun but you're gonna be

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.160 
fast super fun but you're gonna be
working<00:02:04.520> a<00:02:04.700> little<00:02:04.909> bit<00:02:05.119> harder<00:02:05.180> how<00:02:05.990> much

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
working a little bit harder how much

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.630 
working a little bit harder how much
harder<00:02:06.470> are<00:02:06.590> we<00:02:06.710> talking<00:02:07.190> here<00:02:07.400> I<00:02:07.430> think

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
harder are we talking here I think

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.770 
harder are we talking here I think
that's<00:02:07.820> a<00:02:07.909> question<00:02:08.209> that<00:02:08.330> people<00:02:08.420> are<00:02:08.600> gonna

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
that's a question that people are gonna

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.809 
that's a question that people are gonna
want<00:02:09.020> to<00:02:09.110> know<00:02:09.170> absolutely<00:02:09.649> so<00:02:10.310> the<00:02:10.550> way<00:02:10.670> we

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
want to know absolutely so the way we

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:11.800 
want to know absolutely so the way we
like<00:02:10.940> to<00:02:10.970> think<00:02:11.180> about<00:02:11.209> it<00:02:11.420> is<00:02:11.510> the<00:02:11.660> motor

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
like to think about it is the motor

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.750 
like to think about it is the motor
actually<00:02:12.020> ends<00:02:12.470> up<00:02:12.560> being<00:02:12.709> about<00:02:12.800> 20%<00:02:13.640> smaller

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
actually ends up being about 20% smaller

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.730 
actually ends up being about 20% smaller
so<00:02:14.180> the<00:02:14.300> magnets<00:02:14.720> inside<00:02:14.990> are<00:02:15.170> about<00:02:15.319> 20%

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
so the magnets inside are about 20%

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.770 
so the magnets inside are about 20%
narrower<00:02:16.580> and<00:02:17.090> so<00:02:17.240> a<00:02:17.270> great<00:02:17.480> way<00:02:17.630> to<00:02:17.660> think

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
narrower and so a great way to think

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.570 
narrower and so a great way to think
about<00:02:18.050> it<00:02:18.170> is<00:02:18.290> anybody<00:02:18.920> that's<00:02:19.160> ridden<00:02:19.489> the

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
about it is anybody that's ridden the

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.550 
about it is anybody that's ridden the
Turbo<00:02:19.850> S<00:02:20.000> knows<00:02:20.360> that<00:02:20.569> you<00:02:20.750> can<00:02:20.870> go<00:02:20.959> 28<00:02:21.350> miles

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
Turbo S knows that you can go 28 miles

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.500 
Turbo S knows that you can go 28 miles
per<00:02:21.680> hour<00:02:21.830> but<00:02:22.040> the<00:02:22.190> sweet<00:02:22.670> spot<00:02:23.000> like<00:02:23.300> that

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
per hour but the sweet spot like that

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.440 
per hour but the sweet spot like that
perfect<00:02:23.840> cruising<00:02:24.770> spot<00:02:25.069> is<00:02:25.430> around<00:02:25.730> 25<00:02:26.180> miles

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
perfect cruising spot is around 25 miles

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.059 
perfect cruising spot is around 25 miles
per<00:02:26.630> hour<00:02:26.780> where<00:02:27.110> you're<00:02:27.500> not<00:02:27.590> working<00:02:27.920> too

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
per hour where you're not working too

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:29.860 
per hour where you're not working too
hard<00:02:28.100> you<00:02:28.459> just<00:02:28.520> feel<00:02:28.790> like<00:02:28.940> you're<00:02:29.060> flying<00:02:29.480> on

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
hard you just feel like you're flying on

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.500 
hard you just feel like you're flying on
the<00:02:30.440> new<00:02:30.560> turbo<00:02:30.950> it's<00:02:31.370> gonna<00:02:31.489> be<00:02:31.700> around<00:02:31.910> 20<00:02:32.360> to

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
the new turbo it's gonna be around 20 to

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.900 
the new turbo it's gonna be around 20 to
23<00:02:33.260> miles<00:02:33.620> an<00:02:33.830> hour<00:02:33.950> so<00:02:34.310> you<00:02:34.430> can<00:02:34.550> still<00:02:34.790> get

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
23 miles an hour so you can still get

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.790 
23 miles an hour so you can still get
all<00:02:35.120> the<00:02:35.239> way<00:02:35.300> up<00:02:35.390> to<00:02:35.510> 28<00:02:35.930> but<00:02:36.170> those<00:02:36.320> upper

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
all the way up to 28 but those upper

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.590 
all the way up to 28 but those upper
couple<00:02:37.280> miles<00:02:37.489> per<00:02:37.760> hour<00:02:37.880> you'll<00:02:38.209> be<00:02:38.239> working

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
couple miles per hour you'll be working

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.210 
couple miles per hour you'll be working
a<00:02:38.660> little<00:02:38.750> harder<00:02:38.900> okay<00:02:39.560> so<00:02:39.620> it<00:02:39.800> still<00:02:39.980> makes<00:02:40.130> a

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
a little harder okay so it still makes a

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.650 
a little harder okay so it still makes a
pretty<00:02:40.400> good<00:02:40.459> motor<00:02:40.730> pacing<00:02:41.180> vehicle<00:02:41.540> oh

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
pretty good motor pacing vehicle oh

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.000 
pretty good motor pacing vehicle oh
absolutely<00:02:44.470> it<00:02:45.470> goes<00:02:45.800> without<00:02:45.860> saying

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
absolutely it goes without saying

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.070 
absolutely it goes without saying
somebody<00:02:46.760> gets<00:02:46.940> on<00:02:47.030> a<00:02:47.060> turbo<00:02:47.420> they<00:02:47.630> ride<00:02:47.900> it

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
somebody gets on a turbo they ride it

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.720 
somebody gets on a turbo they ride it
and<00:02:48.230> they<00:02:48.290> get<00:02:48.950> it<00:02:49.130> like<00:02:49.310> they<00:02:49.459> come<00:02:49.610> back

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
and they get it like they come back

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.009 
and they get it like they come back
their<00:02:49.910> smile<00:02:50.180> on<00:02:50.300> their<00:02:50.360> face<00:02:50.540> so<00:02:50.780> what<00:02:50.930> would

their smile on their face so what would

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:52.390 
their smile on their face so what would
you<00:02:51.140> say<00:02:51.290> to<00:02:51.350> the<00:02:51.440> people<00:02:51.530> that<00:02:51.800> haven't<00:02:52.070> tried

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
you say to the people that haven't tried

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.580 
you say to the people that haven't tried
one<00:02:52.610> before<00:02:52.640> what<00:02:53.390> what<00:02:54.200> do<00:02:54.290> they<00:02:54.380> need<00:02:54.530> to
