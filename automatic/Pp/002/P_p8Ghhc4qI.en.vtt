 hh technique 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.780
 I think I think that's the way I'm not sure

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.210
 times on the channel in comments and so on 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.160

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.989
 mold helped so first of all a 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.090
 advice and a session got quick on 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.129
 the setup we can go to mods like I did 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.460
 always or in game rule is here where 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.840
 we can change it and write the 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.220
 exact way if we know it so he played 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.230
 dot tvm 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.580

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.430
 those and he has put us classic for some 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.110
 reason should get juice 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.420

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.550
 previous techniques but good I think 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.890

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.440
 with blood out there rolling around so it's 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.250
 a very nice technique that many 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.220
 thanks h 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.830
 for all you have offered to us all 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.810
 so as always I say the first 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.340
 you have the technique of description in 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.990
 a word and now the information 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.610
 important is good, that also 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:42.150
 important but now the information more 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.659
 if you understand me and I understand 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.879
 what Ivan Rivas is starting to 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:50.250
 get tired I know it's a piece of game and 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:52.569
 Well you are already seeing because I know it is 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.689
 a piece of game and so on but not 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:57.459
 no longer no no fire as before then 

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:59.709
 I 'm not going to bring you any techniques or anything 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:02.260
 This means that I will stop 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.659
 climb thorium base yes but that is not to say in 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.700
 principle if I'm not going to upload techniques not 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:09.790
 I'm going to upload anything normal from thor and you're going 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:12.639
 nothing if you but maybe this time 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.989
 when I bring you something something in plan that 

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:15.670
 it is something to the best when with a 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.230
 Subscriber with two subscribers with three 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.730
 with those who are with those who find me 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.439
 with which I say when I will continue 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.879
 playing but I do not want to bring or story 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:24.280
 more because it is becoming something 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:26.169
 important in the channel and it was but 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.310
 is turning to explain to me 

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:30.400
 While it was becoming 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.930
 in the center of the channel like in the game 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.700
 base and that the rest were there as of 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.020
 accompaniment and I did not want that I 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.670
 I wanted it to be a series more like 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.470
 all the others is more in the beginning 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.060
 it was a small test what I did 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.580
 I win very much and I'm glad of it 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.590
 so good after what I say 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.989
 I'm not going to upload everything and you're going 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.370
 assiduous I know that many people were 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:51.380
 here on my channel just for theories 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.750
 then it would be perfectly understood that 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.280
 those people would subscribe to them like that 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.130
 that if you are one of those people 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.170
 before subscribing that it seems good 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.480
 that you do send me a comment to 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.910
 this video telling me what you want 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.920
 but so you know you've gone by 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.380
 that because suddenly there are ten 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.069
 people who have left because they have seen 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.049
 this video and not even 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:15.239
 basically we have been fired not for that 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:17.669
 say it because they do not get many of 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:20.790
 I know you and the truth is that 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:23.160

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:26.100

 I can not continue with all then 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.130
 that before extending me more and putting me 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.660
 more melancholic 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.400
