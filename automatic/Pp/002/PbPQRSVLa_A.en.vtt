00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
this year that are sort of used as

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.200 
this year that are sort of used as
dividers<00:00:42.680> so<00:00:43.250> at<00:00:43.370> any<00:00:43.520> point<00:00:43.610> in<00:00:43.970> time<00:00:44.000> during

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
dividers so at any point in time during

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.630 
dividers so at any point in time during
the<00:00:44.510> show<00:00:44.720> we<00:00:45.230> divide<00:00:45.590> different<00:00:46.010> stages<00:00:46.489> and

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
the show we divide different stages and

you might not do or you might have to
compose<00:01:45.130> into<00:01:45.430> the<00:01:45.550> work<00:01:45.730> we're<00:01:46.240> really<00:01:46.270> get

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
compose into the work we're really get

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.600 
compose into the work we're really get
drawing<00:01:46.930> from<00:01:47.140> the<00:01:47.230> original<00:01:47.650> material<00:01:48.160> my

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
drawing from the original material my

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.430 
drawing from the original material my
favorite<00:01:49.060> movement<00:01:49.540> I<00:01:49.720> think<00:01:50.080> in<00:01:50.200> the<00:01:50.320> entire

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
favorite movement I think in the entire

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.310 
favorite movement I think in the entire
show<00:01:50.650> is<00:01:51.250> a<00:01:51.280> piece<00:01:51.820> that<00:01:52.450> isn't<00:01:52.630> the<00:01:52.810> Scherzo

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
show is a piece that isn't the Scherzo

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.220 
show is a piece that isn't the Scherzo
feel<00:01:54.160> and<00:01:54.490> it's<00:01:55.240> a<00:01:55.330> part<00:01:55.570> of<00:01:55.660> symphony<00:01:55.990> number

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:56.230 
feel and it's a part of symphony number

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.380 
feel and it's a part of symphony number
one<00:01:56.560> and<00:01:56.950> what<00:01:57.070> I<00:01:57.100> like<00:01:57.310> about<00:01:57.340> it<00:01:57.790> is<00:01:57.940> using

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
one and what I like about it is using

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.680 
one and what I like about it is using
this<00:01:59.050> divided<00:01:59.800> idea<00:02:00.400> of<00:02:00.610> side<00:02:00.880> by<00:02:01.060> side<00:02:01.360> we

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
this divided idea of side by side we

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.150 
this divided idea of side by side we
create<00:02:01.990> all<00:02:02.080> these<00:02:02.230> different<00:02:02.560> stages<00:02:03.010> on<00:02:03.130> the

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
create all these different stages on the

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.370 
create all these different stages on the
field<00:02:03.460> and<00:02:03.670> that's<00:02:03.820> given<00:02:04.120> us<00:02:04.240> opportunity<00:02:04.900> to

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
field and that's given us opportunity to

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.500 
field and that's given us opportunity to
really<00:02:05.620> feature<00:02:05.890> the<00:02:06.100> percussion<00:02:06.580> section<00:02:06.610> at

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
really feature the percussion section at

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.359 
really feature the percussion section at
various<00:02:08.020> times<00:02:08.320> throughout<00:02:08.440> this<00:02:08.860> movement

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
various times throughout this movement

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.400 
various times throughout this movement
and<00:02:09.550> a<00:02:10.270> lot<00:02:10.510> of<00:02:10.540> the<00:02:10.720> way<00:02:10.810> that<00:02:10.990> they<00:02:11.080> come<00:02:11.260> into

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
and a lot of the way that they come into

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.530 
and a lot of the way that they come into
the<00:02:11.560> texture<00:02:11.980> it's<00:02:12.130> a<00:02:12.220> big<00:02:12.400> surprise<00:02:12.760> the<00:02:13.420> way

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
the texture it's a big surprise the way

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.480 
the texture it's a big surprise the way
that<00:02:13.690> they<00:02:13.810> all<00:02:14.020> of<00:02:14.140> a<00:02:14.230> sudden<00:02:14.500> appear<00:02:14.920> and<00:02:15.100> we

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
that they all of a sudden appear and we

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:36.840 
that they all of a sudden appear and we
add<00:02:15.670> our<00:02:16.000> voice<00:02:16.360> into<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:16.780> mix

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.400 

one<00:02:37.850> thing<00:02:38.060> that's<00:02:38.240> pretty<00:02:38.330> cool<00:02:38.569> about<00:02:38.780> that

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
one thing that's pretty cool about that

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.830 
one thing that's pretty cool about that
scherzo<00:02:40.069> feel<00:02:40.370> we're<00:02:41.000> in<00:02:41.090> a<00:02:41.150> compound<00:02:41.630> meter

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
scherzo feel we're in a compound meter

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.110 
scherzo feel we're in a compound meter
so<00:02:42.110> yet<00:02:42.380> the<00:02:42.920> detective<00:02:43.340> data<00:02:43.640> that<00:02:43.880> that<00:02:43.910> is

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
so yet the detective data that that is

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.270 
so yet the detective data that that is
not<00:02:44.270> the<00:02:44.569> breakneck<00:02:44.959> speeds<00:02:45.680> that<00:02:45.860> the<00:02:45.980> cadets

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
not the breakneck speeds that the cadets

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.770 
not the breakneck speeds that the cadets
are<00:02:46.430> known<00:02:46.550> for<00:02:46.760> we've<00:02:47.030> been<00:02:47.060> able<00:02:47.239> to<00:02:47.390> offer<00:02:47.480> a

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
are known for we've been able to offer a

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.710 
are known for we've been able to offer a
lot<00:02:47.959> of<00:02:48.020> flam<00:02:48.410> vocabulary<00:02:49.130> and<00:02:49.480> it's<00:02:50.480> really

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
lot of flam vocabulary and it's really

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.990 
lot of flam vocabulary and it's really
actually<00:02:51.050> a<00:02:51.080> string<00:02:51.440> part<00:02:51.770> that<00:02:52.340> we<00:02:52.489> took<00:02:52.730> and

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
actually a string part that we took and

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.090 
actually a string part that we took and
transferred<00:02:53.720> into<00:02:54.110> the<00:02:54.230> keyboard<00:02:54.410> section

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
transferred into the keyboard section

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.830 
transferred into the keyboard section
and<00:02:55.250> then<00:02:55.700> we<00:02:55.819> added<00:02:56.060> all<00:02:56.270> this<00:02:56.390> Flambeau

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
and then we added all this Flambeau

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.449 
and then we added all this Flambeau
Cavalieri<00:02:57.319> to<00:02:57.530> give<00:02:57.680> a<00:02:57.890> little<00:02:58.220> bit<00:02:58.340> of

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
Cavalieri to give a little bit of

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.490 
Cavalieri to give a little bit of
texturing<00:02:59.030> to<00:02:59.150> the<00:02:59.270> note<00:02:59.480> length<00:03:00.019> and<00:03:00.380> it

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
texturing to the note length and it

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.380 
texturing to the note length and it
really<00:03:00.650> gives<00:03:00.920> it<00:03:01.040> an<00:03:01.190> equality<00:03:01.880> a<00:03:01.910> dance<00:03:02.180> like

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
really gives it an equality a dance like

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:39.490 
really gives it an equality a dance like
quality<00:03:02.840> throughout<00:03:03.140> these<00:03:03.320> features

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.050 

another<00:03:40.500> thing<00:03:40.740> that's<00:03:40.860> really<00:03:41.070> cool<00:03:41.400> is<00:03:41.610> by

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
another thing that's really cool is by

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.700 
another thing that's really cool is by
the<00:03:42.120> end<00:03:42.210> of<00:03:42.450> this<00:03:42.600> we<00:03:42.930> start<00:03:43.200> to<00:03:43.290> tend<00:03:43.470> into<00:03:43.620> a

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:43.710 
the end of this we start to tend into a

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:47.260 
the end of this we start to tend into a
lot<00:03:43.950> of<00:03:43.980> these<00:03:44.300> complex<00:03:45.300> rhythmic<00:03:45.860> vocabulary

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:47.270 
lot of these complex rhythmic vocabulary

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:49.430 
lot of these complex rhythmic vocabulary
situations<00:03:48.270> where<00:03:48.510> we're<00:03:48.720> using<00:03:48.990> compound

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
situations where we're using compound

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.800 
situations where we're using compound
meter<00:03:49.770> in<00:03:50.100> and<00:03:50.370> around<00:03:50.610> the<00:03:50.790> pit<00:03:51.270> versus<00:03:51.720> the

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
meter in and around the pit versus the

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.040 
meter in and around the pit versus the
battery<00:03:52.230> and<00:03:52.380> this<00:03:52.580> cacophony<00:03:53.580> of<00:03:53.670> rhythmic

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 
battery and this cacophony of rhythmic

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:55.850 
battery and this cacophony of rhythmic
vocabulary<00:03:55.050> that<00:03:55.200> I<00:03:55.260> think<00:03:55.560> is<00:03:55.680> really

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
vocabulary that I think is really

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:21.750 
vocabulary that I think is really
interesting

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.550 

well<00:04:22.760> it's<00:04:22.940> very<00:04:23.150> early<00:04:23.389> season<00:04:23.960> still<00:04:24.199> so

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
well it's very early season still so

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.770 
well it's very early season still so
we're<00:04:24.889> actually<00:04:25.100> still<00:04:25.639> completing<00:04:26.330> the<00:04:26.570> show

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
we're actually still completing the show

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.930 
we're actually still completing the show
itself<00:04:27.260> learning<00:04:27.889> drill<00:04:28.160> and<00:04:28.370> whatnot

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
itself learning drill and whatnot

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.760 
itself learning drill and whatnot
but<00:04:29.360> the<00:04:29.570> ingredients<00:04:29.930> are<00:04:30.410> there<00:04:30.560> this<00:04:30.710> year

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
but the ingredients are there this year

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.500 
but the ingredients are there this year
it's<00:04:31.100> really<00:04:31.160> the<00:04:31.580> music<00:04:32.000> and<00:04:32.150> the<00:04:32.240> source

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
it's really the music and the source

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.050 
it's really the music and the source
material<00:04:33.080> has<00:04:33.260> offered<00:04:33.710> a<00:04:33.800> lot<00:04:34.039> of<00:04:34.220> spark<00:04:34.850> and

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
material has offered a lot of spark and

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.719 
material has offered a lot of spark and
a<00:04:35.570> lot<00:04:35.780> of<00:04:35.810> percussive<00:04:36.500> interest<00:04:37.010> for<00:04:37.340> us<00:04:37.370> and

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:37.729 
a lot of percussive interest for us and

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:38.950 
a lot of percussive interest for us and
we<00:04:37.820> I<00:04:37.850> think<00:04:38.060> it's<00:04:38.330> going<00:04:38.479> to<00:04:38.510> be<00:04:38.660> really

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
we I think it's going to be really

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.870 
we I think it's going to be really
exciting<00:04:39.350> to<00:04:39.380> see<00:04:39.650> where<00:04:40.190> we're<00:04:40.430> able<00:04:40.520> to<00:04:40.729> take

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
exciting to see where we're able to take

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.820 
exciting to see where we're able to take
this<00:04:41.090> down<00:04:41.270> the<00:04:41.449> road<00:04:41.479> and<00:04:41.960> hopefully<00:04:42.410> you<00:04:42.710> all

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
this down the road and hopefully you all

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.439 
this down the road and hopefully you all
get<00:04:42.979> a<00:04:43.010> chance<00:04:43.070> to<00:04:43.430> see<00:04:43.639> us<00:04:43.789> at<00:04:43.940> the<00:04:43.970> end<00:04:44.240> when

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:44.449 
get a chance to see us at the end when

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:46.750 
get a chance to see us at the end when
we<00:04:44.539> have<00:04:44.690> this<00:04:44.840> refined<00:04:45.350> into<00:04:45.740> a<00:04:45.770> fine<00:04:46.430> oiled

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
we have this refined into a fine oiled

00:04:46.760 --> 00:07:26.480 
we have this refined into a fine oiled
machine

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:26.490 

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:28.550
