00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
can see like I mentioned before the nuts

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.560 
can see like I mentioned before the nuts
that<00:02:48.110> actually<00:02:48.410> hold<00:02:48.650> those<00:02:48.920> screws<00:02:49.570> tight

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
that actually hold those screws tight

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.690 
that actually hold those screws tight
down<00:02:51.080> to<00:02:51.260> the<00:02:51.350> body<00:02:51.560> so<00:02:52.130> that<00:02:52.160> the<00:02:52.280> bridge<00:02:52.550> has

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
down to the body so that the bridge has

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.820 
down to the body so that the bridge has
enough<00:02:52.940> tension<00:02:53.180> and<00:02:54.140> actually<00:02:54.500> see<00:02:54.680> that

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
enough tension and actually see that

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.310 
enough tension and actually see that
right<00:02:55.040> there<00:02:55.420> we<00:02:56.420> come<00:02:56.630> up<00:02:56.750> top<00:02:56.930> here<00:02:57.170> you<00:02:57.290> can

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
right there we come up top here you can

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.500 
right there we come up top here you can
see<00:02:57.530> the<00:02:57.650> bridge<00:02:57.860> get<00:02:58.610> even<00:02:58.970> closer<00:02:59.239> to<00:02:59.420> the

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
see the bridge get even closer to the

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.130 
see the bridge get even closer to the
body<00:02:59.690> and<00:02:59.870> more<00:03:00.110> the<00:03:00.730> goober<00:03:01.730> super<00:03:02.140> bridge

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
body and more the goober super bridge

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:09.570 
body and more the goober super bridge
sticky<00:03:03.920> stuff<00:03:04.480> the<00:03:05.480> thumbs<00:03:05.720> loosen<00:03:06.110> out<00:03:06.230> more

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.040 

pretty<00:03:10.580> cool<00:03:10.760> stuff<00:03:11.000> here<00:03:11.180> that's<00:03:11.810> just<00:03:11.989> a

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
pretty cool stuff here that's just a

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:13.500 
pretty cool stuff here that's just a
matter<00:03:12.170> of<00:03:12.290> cleaning<00:03:12.470> off<00:03:12.709> that<00:03:12.890> excess

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
matter of cleaning off that excess

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:22.240 
matter of cleaning off that excess
excess<00:03:14.510> glue<00:03:18.910> you<00:03:19.910> can<00:03:19.970> see<00:03:20.239> me

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
excess glue you can see me

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.130 
excess glue you can see me
doing<00:03:22.880> very<00:03:23.090> very<00:03:23.210> meticulously<00:03:23.990> here<00:03:26.140> and

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
doing very very meticulously here and

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.960 
doing very very meticulously here and
then<00:03:27.290> of<00:03:27.410> course<00:03:27.440> the<00:03:27.920> next<00:03:28.250> step<00:03:28.370> would<00:03:28.730> be<00:03:28.790> to

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
then of course the next step would be to

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.600 
then of course the next step would be to
jet<00:03:29.780> clamp<00:03:30.080> it<00:03:30.200> to<00:03:30.320> the<00:03:30.350> body<00:03:30.560> I'm<00:03:31.370> just

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
jet clamp it to the body I'm just

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.490 
jet clamp it to the body I'm just
kidding<00:03:31.850> we<00:03:31.970> just<00:03:32.180> clamp<00:03:32.690> it<00:03:32.840> to<00:03:32.930> the<00:03:33.020> body<00:03:33.200> so

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
kidding we just clamp it to the body so

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.870 
kidding we just clamp it to the body so
it<00:03:33.910> it<00:03:34.910> drives<00:03:35.600> evenly<00:03:36.140> and<00:03:36.380> it<00:03:37.250> hears<00:03:37.520> evenly

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
it it drives evenly and it hears evenly

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.390 
it it drives evenly and it hears evenly
alright<00:03:38.810> so<00:03:38.959> as<00:03:39.050> you<00:03:39.110> can<00:03:39.260> see<00:03:39.410> we<00:03:39.590> have<00:03:39.890> the

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
alright so as you can see we have the

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.980 
alright so as you can see we have the
bridge<00:03:40.700> here<00:03:42.040> it's<00:03:43.040> all<00:03:43.130> clamped<00:03:43.520> down<00:03:43.990> of

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:44.990 
bridge here it's all clamped down of

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:46.480 
bridge here it's all clamped down of
course<00:03:45.260> you<00:03:45.380> know<00:03:45.620> you<00:03:45.890> want<00:03:46.070> to<00:03:46.100> place<00:03:46.310> the

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:46.490 
course you know you want to place the

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:47.770 
course you know you want to place the
cork<00:03:46.760> there<00:03:46.940> so<00:03:47.090> you<00:03:47.180> don't<00:03:47.330> damage<00:03:47.510> the

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
cork there so you don't damage the

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.140 
cork there so you don't damage the
finish<00:03:47.959> obviously<00:03:48.620> I<00:03:48.830> mean<00:03:49.370> I<00:03:49.430> say<00:03:49.640> obviously

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
finish obviously I mean I say obviously

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.250 
finish obviously I mean I say obviously
but<00:03:50.330> you<00:03:50.420> know<00:03:50.450> you'd<00:03:50.630> be<00:03:50.720> surprised<00:03:51.080> how<00:03:51.110> many

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
but you know you'd be surprised how many

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.210 
but you know you'd be surprised how many
people<00:03:51.380> wouldn't<00:03:52.160> think<00:03:52.250> to<00:03:52.400> do<00:03:52.520> that<00:03:53.440> and<00:03:54.440> you

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
people wouldn't think to do that and you

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.800 
people wouldn't think to do that and you
can<00:03:55.340> see<00:03:55.520> more<00:03:55.820> of<00:03:55.940> the<00:03:56.060> more<00:03:56.420> of<00:03:56.480> the<00:03:56.600> glue

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
can see more of the more of the glue

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.420 
can see more of the more of the glue
oozing<00:03:57.080> out<00:03:57.440> a<00:03:57.470> little<00:03:57.650> bit<00:03:57.890> here<00:03:58.010> but<00:03:58.310> yeah

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
oozing out a little bit here but yeah

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.130 
oozing out a little bit here but yeah
this<00:03:58.640> just<00:03:58.820> ensures<00:03:58.970> that<00:03:59.360> the<00:03:59.570> bridge<00:03:59.810> makes

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
this just ensures that the bridge makes

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.920 
this just ensures that the bridge makes
solid<00:04:00.620> contact<00:04:01.130> with<00:04:01.430> 100%<00:04:02.120> of<00:04:02.600> the<00:04:02.720> body

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
solid contact with 100% of the body

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.320 
solid contact with 100% of the body
after<00:04:03.830> this<00:04:04.100> thing<00:04:04.280> dries<00:04:04.580> she'll<00:04:05.239> get

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
after this thing dries she'll get

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.320 
after this thing dries she'll get
stringed<00:04:05.690> up<00:04:06.100> they'll<00:04:07.100> go<00:04:07.250> ahead<00:04:07.489> and<00:04:07.610> place

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
stringed up they'll go ahead and place

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.729 
stringed up they'll go ahead and place
the<00:04:08.959> two<00:04:09.770> pieces<00:04:10.250> of<00:04:11.080> inlay<00:04:12.080> right<00:04:12.350> in<00:04:12.500> there

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739
