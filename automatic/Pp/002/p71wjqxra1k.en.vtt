like that I mean there's no point in
comparing<00:02:18.060> them<00:02:18.330> because<00:02:18.660> everyone's<00:02:19.260> got

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
comparing them because everyone's got

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.040 
comparing them because everyone's got
their<00:02:19.560> own<00:02:19.709> preferences<00:02:20.310> and<00:02:20.819> everyone<00:02:21.810> has

their own opinion on what makes the

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.730 
their own opinion on what makes the
council<00:02:24.300> great<00:02:24.540> some<00:02:24.990> people<00:02:25.230> care<00:02:25.410> about<00:02:25.500> the

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
council great some people care about the

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.860 
council great some people care about the
xbox<00:02:26.190> one<00:02:26.430> use<00:02:26.670> game<00:02:26.910> policies<00:02:27.450> and<00:02:27.690> some

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
xbox one use game policies and some

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.360 
xbox one use game policies and some
people<00:02:28.110> don't<00:02:28.140> care<00:02:28.530> at<00:02:28.650> all<00:02:28.740> because<00:02:29.010> hey

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
people don't care at all because hey

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.130 
people don't care at all because hey
they<00:02:29.819> say<00:02:30.030> that<00:02:30.180> they<00:02:30.239> don't<00:02:30.270> buy<00:02:30.630> used<00:02:30.900> games

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
they say that they don't buy used games

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.600 
they say that they don't buy used games
and<00:02:31.440> they<00:02:31.500> say<00:02:31.620> they<00:02:31.739> don't<00:02:31.830> sell<00:02:32.220> used<00:02:32.489> games

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
and they say they don't sell used games

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.670 
and they say they don't sell used games
so<00:02:33.090> so<00:02:33.480> there's<00:02:33.660> really<00:02:33.750> no<00:02:33.959> point<00:02:34.260> in<00:02:34.470> saying

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
so so there's really no point in saying

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.710 
so so there's really no point in saying
one<00:02:35.069> consoles<00:02:35.640> but<00:02:35.760> on<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.000> other<00:02:36.120> what<00:02:36.600> you

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
one consoles but on the other what you

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.900 
one consoles but on the other what you
can<00:02:36.959> say<00:02:37.260> is<00:02:37.290> you<00:02:37.709> know<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:37.950> PlayStation<00:02:38.400> 4<00:02:38.670> is

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
can say is you know the PlayStation 4 is

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.030 
can say is you know the PlayStation 4 is
a<00:02:38.940> better<00:02:39.180> value<00:02:39.420> than<00:02:39.600> the<00:02:39.750> xbox<00:02:40.260> so<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.620> xbox

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
a better value than the xbox so the xbox

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.650 
a better value than the xbox so the xbox
is<00:02:41.160> a<00:02:41.280> better<00:02:41.430> value<00:02:41.640> in<00:02:41.850> the<00:02:41.910> playstation<00:02:42.510> or

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
is a better value in the playstation or

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.690 
is a better value in the playstation or
the<00:02:43.350> playstation<00:02:43.920> 4<00:02:44.160> is<00:02:44.310> going<00:02:44.459> to<00:02:44.520> have

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
the playstation 4 is going to have

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.390 
the playstation 4 is going to have
better<00:02:45.360> graphics<00:02:45.930> than<00:02:46.050> the<00:02:46.290> xbox<00:02:46.709> one<00:02:47.040> or<00:02:47.310> the

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
better graphics than the xbox one or the

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.479 
better graphics than the xbox one or the
xbox<00:02:47.880> one<00:02:48.269> is<00:02:48.660> less<00:02:49.230> powerful<00:02:49.620> in<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:49.920> ps4<00:02:50.250> I

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
xbox one is less powerful in the ps4 I

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.640 
xbox one is less powerful in the ps4 I
mean<00:02:50.700> we<00:02:50.880> can<00:02:51.060> make<00:02:51.269> these<00:02:51.510> judgments<00:02:51.650> because

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
mean we can make these judgments because

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.590 
mean we can make these judgments because
there<00:02:53.040> is<00:02:53.190> actual<00:02:53.610> validity<00:02:54.150> to<00:02:54.180> them<00:02:54.420> because

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
there is actual validity to them because

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.240 
there is actual validity to them because
you<00:02:54.750> can<00:02:54.870> actually<00:02:54.930> test<00:02:55.320> these<00:02:55.500> out<00:02:55.709> but

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
you can actually test these out but

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.590 
you can actually test these out but
saying<00:02:56.519> one<00:02:56.730> consoles<00:02:57.269> better<00:02:57.450> than<00:02:57.540> the

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
saying one consoles better than the

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.509 
saying one consoles better than the
other<00:02:57.780> is<00:02:58.080> a<00:02:58.110> really<00:02:58.530> weak<00:02:58.739> argument<00:02:59.310> in<00:02:59.400> my

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
other is a really weak argument in my

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.610 
other is a really weak argument in my
eyes<00:02:59.640> because<00:02:59.910> hey<00:03:00.269> we<00:03:01.080> all<00:03:01.290> got<00:03:01.500> different

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620
