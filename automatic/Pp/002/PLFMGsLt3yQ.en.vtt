00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:22.520
 then here are twigs details of length 10 here 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:28.450
 such kruglyashkov shorter than you understand 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:34.340
 so we put on the rear armor 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:39.200
 This is how this looks any smoothly . 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:45.380
 necessarily with some number here 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:55.370
 further here is how it is called upper there 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:57.860
 frontal began to look like this and 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.310
 before we need to put this one 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.310
 detail 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:13.800
 put here and then them but on this one 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:19.030
 detail we put our armor sheet 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:26.410
 that's how it turns out I'm already cold 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:31.410
 decently so it means a board that people 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:37.620
 somehow Well and 8 2 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.620
 here 12 and 6 6 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:54.640
 We believe that's here here here this Circuits 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:03:02.360
 raise like this then put back 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:08.140
 smooth so on the starboard my left 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:08.140
 almost like this 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:24.420
 here we insert here so as further back 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:24.420
 part here she does 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:36.350
 here then go well here goes the same 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.150

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.770
 here you go 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:17.130
 so then let's put here 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:20.340
 our guns carry it themselves to the gun 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:22.710
 further did not turn here such 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:28.250
 it certainly is not necessary well after all 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:28.250
 preferably, well, people look like this and 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:42.800
