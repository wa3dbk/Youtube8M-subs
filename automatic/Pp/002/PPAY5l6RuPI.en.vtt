00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:05.240 
possible matches like 34 and then

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:09.620 
possible matches like 34 and then
matches<00:01:06.240> 53<00:01:07.399> so<00:01:08.399> if<00:01:08.490> there's<00:01:08.670> 34<00:01:09.149> possible

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
matches 53 so if there's 34 possible

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.469 
matches 53 so if there's 34 possible
messages<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.500> there's<00:01:11.490> 90,000<00:01:12.390> people

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:16.990 
guy so when I do have it on there and
I'm<00:02:15.870> playing<00:02:16.170> that<00:02:16.440> kind<00:02:16.680> of

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
I'm playing that kind of

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.100 
I'm playing that kind of
I<00:02:17.030> don't<00:02:17.690> know<00:02:18.010> so<00:02:19.010> I<00:02:19.570> don't<00:02:20.570> know<00:02:20.720> what's<00:02:20.900> up

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.050 
with that I think bunge needs to do
another<00:02:23.690> software<00:02:24.560> update<00:02:25.040> because<00:02:25.610> they<00:02:25.850> did

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
another software update because they did

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.720 
another software update because they did
one<00:02:26.210> before<00:02:26.690> but<00:02:27.320> what<00:02:28.040> they<00:02:28.160> did<00:02:28.430> is<00:02:28.670> that

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
one before but what they did is that

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.780 
one before but what they did is that
they<00:02:29.000> randomized<00:02:29.810> it<00:02:30.080> because<00:02:30.380> before<00:02:30.790> even

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
they randomized it because before even

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.910 
they randomized it because before even
if<00:02:31.910> you<00:02:32.000> vetoed<00:02:32.330> the<00:02:32.510> match<00:02:32.720> sometimes<00:02:33.620> you

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
if you vetoed the match sometimes you

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.020 
if you vetoed the match sometimes you
know<00:02:34.070> you<00:02:34.370> get<00:02:34.850> the<00:02:35.000> same<00:02:35.150> match<00:02:35.390> again<00:02:35.840> and

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
know you get the same match again and

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.140 
know you get the same match again and
you<00:02:38.030> know<00:02:38.740> that<00:02:39.740> sucks<00:02:40.220> because<00:02:40.700> you<00:02:40.820> know<00:02:40.970> you

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
you know that sucks because you know you

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:47.110 
you know that sucks because you know you
vetoed<00:02:41.840> it<00:02:42.520> anyway<00:02:43.520> I<00:02:43.880> think<00:02:45.550> Bungie<00:02:46.550> could

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
vetoed it anyway I think Bungie could

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.240 
vetoed it anyway I think Bungie could
fix<00:02:47.720> these<00:02:48.260> problems<00:02:48.290> and<00:02:49.959> um<00:02:50.959> I'm<00:02:51.560> wondering

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
fix these problems and um I'm wondering

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.650 
fix these problems and um I'm wondering
why<00:02:53.120> the<00:02:53.180> female<00:02:54.020> Master<00:02:54.890> Chief<00:02:55.160> you<00:02:56.090> know<00:02:56.239> the

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
why the female Master Chief you know the

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.890 
why the female Master Chief you know the
female<00:02:56.959> Spartan<00:02:57.560> of<00:02:57.680> the<00:02:57.800> female<00:02:58.330> elite<00:02:59.330> the

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
female Spartan of the female elite the

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.720 
female Spartan of the female elite the
only<00:03:00.260> way<00:03:00.380> you<00:03:00.440> can<00:03:00.650> tell<00:03:00.860> a<00:03:00.920> difference<00:03:01.010> is<00:03:01.580> if

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
only way you can tell a difference is if

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.610 
only way you can tell a difference is if
when<00:03:01.910> you<00:03:02.030> smack<00:03:02.510> them<00:03:02.810> when<00:03:03.290> you<00:03:03.380> may<00:03:03.560> lay

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
when you smack them when you may lay

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.140 
when you smack them when you may lay
them<00:03:03.890> down<00:03:03.920> they<00:03:04.310> have<00:03:04.489> like<00:03:04.610> a<00:03:04.670> different
