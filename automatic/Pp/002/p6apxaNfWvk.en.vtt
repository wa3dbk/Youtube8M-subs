measurements of the guitar like the

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.770 
measurements of the guitar like the
action<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:32.099> where<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.790> string<00:00:33.090> spacing<00:00:33.420> was

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
action and where the string spacing was

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.229 
action and where the string spacing was
and<00:00:34.079> everything<00:00:34.610> before<00:00:35.610> I<00:00:35.640> started<00:00:36.000> working

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
and everything before I started working

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.440 
and everything before I started working
on<00:00:36.480> this<00:00:37.250> in<00:00:38.250> fact<00:00:38.489> you<00:00:38.670> know<00:00:38.790> we<00:00:39.059> still<00:00:39.239> have

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
on this in fact you know we still have

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.580 
on this in fact you know we still have
the<00:00:40.010> still<00:00:41.010> have<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.280> old<00:00:41.430> not<00:00:42.270> here<00:00:42.629> over

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
the still have the old not here over

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.330 
the still have the old not here over
there<00:00:43.800> but<00:00:44.520> while<00:00:45.480> was<00:00:45.690> on<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.989> guitar<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.649> used

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
there but while was on the guitar I used

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.549 
there but while was on the guitar I used
one<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:47.610> these<00:00:47.760> string<00:00:48.270> space<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.840> rules<00:00:49.020> and

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
one of these string space and rules and

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.119 
one of these string space and rules and
I<00:00:50.550> marked<00:00:51.079> which<00:00:52.079> scale<00:00:52.440> i'm<00:00:52.649> going<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:52.890> use

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
I marked which scale i'm going to use

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.760 
I marked which scale i'm going to use
when<00:00:53.399> i<00:00:53.430> make<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.149> new<00:00:54.329> um<00:00:54.570> matches<00:00:55.559> in

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
when i make the the new um matches in

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.560 
when i make the the new um matches in
the<00:00:55.949> file<00:00:56.219> that<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.640> string<00:00:56.940> matches<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.510> the

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
the file that the string matches and the

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.099 
the file that the string matches and the
nut<00:00:58.969> because<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.480> strings<00:01:00.719> were<00:01:00.840> sitting

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
nut because the the strings were sitting

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.299 
nut because the the strings were sitting
on<00:01:01.170> here<00:01:01.379> well<00:01:01.590> you<00:01:01.829> know<00:01:01.949> was<00:01:02.129> laid<00:01:02.280> out

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
on here well you know was laid out

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.399 
on here well you know was laid out
pretty<00:01:02.640> nicely<00:01:02.910> so<00:01:03.719> what<00:01:03.870> we<00:01:03.960> got<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.229> do<00:01:04.379> now

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
pretty nicely so what we got to do now

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:12.280 
pretty nicely so what we got to do now
is<00:01:07.430> put<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.460> couple<00:01:08.670> lines<00:01:08.909> on<00:01:09.180> here<00:01:09.450> on<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:10.500> nut

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
is put a couple lines on here on the nut

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.330 
is put a couple lines on here on the nut
where<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.409> bottom<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.830> strings<00:01:14.100> going<00:01:14.280> to

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
where the bottom of the strings going to

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.770 
where the bottom of the strings going to
sit<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.729> then<00:01:14.880> where<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.119> top<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.570> nuts

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
sit and then where the top and the nuts

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.230 
sit and then where the top and the nuts
going<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.020> be<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:17.430> way<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.610> do<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:18.000> is<00:01:18.060> I

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
going to be and the way to do that is I

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.999 
going to be and the way to do that is I
measured<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.650> first<00:01:19.890> fret<00:01:20.189> here<00:01:20.570> with<00:01:21.570> my

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
measured the the first fret here with my

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.749 
measured the the first fret here with my
nifty<00:01:23.009> calipers<00:01:23.729> here<00:01:24.950> you<00:01:25.950> can<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.430> can<00:01:26.580> use

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
nifty calipers here you can you can use

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.999 
nifty calipers here you can you can use
these<00:01:27.000> two<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.869> measure<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.619> know<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.860> height

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
these two to measure you know the height

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.850 
these two to measure you know the height
of<00:01:29.040> your<00:01:29.220> fret<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.270> comes<00:01:30.450> out<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.720> 37<00:01:31.470> and

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.140 

one<00:01:34.860> of<00:01:34.920> these<00:01:35.040> procedures<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.640> looked<00:01:35.850> at<00:01:36.000> what

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
one of these procedures I looked at what

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.590 
one of these procedures I looked at what
they<00:01:36.240> tell<00:01:36.420> you<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.540> do<00:01:36.720> is<00:01:36.869> add<00:01:37.049> about<00:01:37.430> 26,000

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
they tell you to do is add about 26,000

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.510 
they tell you to do is add about 26,000
for<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.780> air<00:01:39.900> gap<00:01:40.110> between<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:41.310> know<00:01:41.400> the

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
for the air gap between the you know the

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.800 
for the air gap between the you know the
top<00:01:41.700> of<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:41.909> fret<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.390> bottom<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:42.750> the

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
top of the fret and the bottom of the

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.520 
top of the fret and the bottom of the
string<00:01:43.159> so<00:01:44.159> that's<00:01:44.369> 63<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.390> then<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.140> top<00:01:46.320> of

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
string so that's 63 and then the top of

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.030 
string so that's 63 and then the top of
the<00:01:46.619> night<00:01:46.770> yet<00:01:46.979> another<00:01:47.689> 30,000<00:01:48.689> side<00:01:49.040> which

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
the night yet another 30,000 side which

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.060 
the night yet another 30,000 side which
would<00:01:50.189> be<00:01:50.310> 93<00:01:50.939> so<00:01:51.090> what<00:01:51.210> I'm<00:01:51.299> going<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.450> do<00:01:51.689> I

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
would be 93 so what I'm going to do I

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.350 
would be 93 so what I'm going to do I
got<00:01:53.070> some<00:01:53.250> fuel<00:01:53.490> gauges<00:01:53.909> here<00:01:54.030> I'm<00:01:54.149> going<00:01:54.270> to

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
got some fuel gauges here I'm going to

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.410 
got some fuel gauges here I'm going to
use<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.630> 40<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.500> I<00:01:56.130> don't<00:01:56.310> have<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.549> 23<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.270> make

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
use the 40 and I don't have a 23 to make

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.420 
use the 40 and I don't have a 23 to make
63<00:01:58.049> so<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.229> think<00:01:58.320> I'll<00:01:58.619> go<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.770> little<00:01:58.920> bigger<00:01:59.130> l

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430
