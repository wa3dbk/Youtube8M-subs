00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.160
 because such my name is usually do re 

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:06.710
 martínez and in this video tutorial then 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:10.330
 let's see a simple example of how 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:13.540
 read and write in text files 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.610
 ence chart 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.060
 I have created a file which contains 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:21.009
 three numbers three lines 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.340
 jowell of this file in the folder in 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:25.420
 where the program is compiled 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.410
 so 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:32.810
 first of all I had to load first 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:36.170
 where an existing library 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:40.820
 the necessary classes for 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:45.050
 be able to read and write files 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.980
 and well that this arm a type arrangement 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.070
 end 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.430
 where will I contain these three 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:58.390
 numbers to then add the three 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:02.020
 numbers will have them in an arrangement here 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.950
 and then save the sum of these 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.659
 three numbers 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.729
 in this same file that is to say see 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.770
 overwrite the file but now I'm going 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.750
 to put what has been the sum of 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.270
 these three numbers 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:16.500
 then to begin it's going to start 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.500
 defining my objects 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.540
 the objects here are in a matter 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.910
 leader that will serve us to read the 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:46.990
 self-esteem file type of astrium 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:50.350
 breaker to write the file and 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.300
 our arrangement can not be on the clock 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.430
 which must contain the three numbers that 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.420
 we have in our file after 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.159
 we add them 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.580
 so what we are going to do first is 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:04.830
 read each number that is found and 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:09.030
 store it in this arrangement 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:11.810
 then what are we going to start our 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.810
 object numbers 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.830
 here we are going to put it you think because 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.560
 we are going to contain our elements well 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.900
 I understand 3 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.550
 three simple numbers 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.830
 all right 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.830
 then we remain conscious 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.250
 here inside the parentheses we are going to 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.140
 put the name of the file in this case 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.380
 yes no 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.390
 an outbreak exists 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.680
 then here we already have loaded in this 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.250
 file we already have open in this 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.200
 file now we continue to read each 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.030
 line that is in the file 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.530
 to be able to store in our article 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.530
 we do it from the following 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.900
 and well here what we do good is 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.830
 start a variable and equal to zero 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:43.930
 we continue with the cycle in condition 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:46.060
 that then saying is while not 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.660
 we are positioned at the end of 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:52.260
 file then we do the following 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:54.240
 we read line we see the lines iii e 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.160
 we increase the literal 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:59.130
 this fence receives to alter over the 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:02.580
 network and be able to store the values ​​that 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:04.950
 will be reading from the file then a 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.710
 Once we have ready 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.900
 the numbers stored in this arrangement 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:13.340
 then it will no longer be necessary to use 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.340
 this object then we close them 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:24.030
 and well now what follows will be to add the 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.030
 three numbers that n 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:50.450
 well here what is is a variable of 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:54.720
 type string sum is equal to convert 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:57.630
 to type sting the sum thrown at us 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.070
 the sub method then with this already 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.710
 we have stored here in this variable 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:05.190
 add the total sum of the three numbers 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:08.130
 that we load from the file then now 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:10.310
 we continue with writing about writing the 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:14.650
 archive 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.650
 writing what is the sum total 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.220
 and here we put the name of the 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.220
 archive 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:34.950
 so 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:38.160
 we write about the point file 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:40.470
 we wrote a line 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.790
 and in this line we go in the variable 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:47.640
 sum that is the one 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:47.640
 you get the total sum already in chain 

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:52.569
 of the three numbers stored in the 

00:05:50.209 --> 00:05:52.569
 ruler 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:56.700
 you alone 

00:05:55.260 --> 00:06:00.890
 and then we're not going to write 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.890
 more in the file then we close 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:11.370
 and well with this we finish taking the 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.979
 program and we will validate if 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:16.410
 effectively add these numbers and 

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:18.860
 they are saved in the same file then 

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:18.860
 let's execute 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:24.060
 that no error occurs mos 

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:25.860
 close now let's check the same 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:29.639
 file let's load it to see if it 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:32.220
 saved the sum let's give it open here and 

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:35.190
 we see that if the 

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:40.099
 sum internally we had 10 15 and 10 

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:42.060
 10 + 15 25 + 10 35 then 

00:06:40.099 --> 00:06:43.889
 effectively if you saved what 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:46.889
 we did 

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:48.300
 with the arrangement that is the sum of the 

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:51.749
 three numbers that we had before in the 

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:55.979
 file were added and pse about wrote 

00:06:51.749 --> 00:06:59.310
 in that file and the total sum was put 

00:06:55.979 --> 00:07:06.300
 of the 33 then with this we take for 

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:10.909
 finish our simple example 

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:10.909
 and well this is all until next time
