00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.900 
thick
I<00:04:19.530> assume<00:04:20.530> it's<00:04:20.739> because<00:04:20.799> the<00:04:21.190> mint<00:04:21.459> care<00:04:21.639> has

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.430 
I assume it's because the mint care has
to<00:04:22.030> have<00:04:22.120> a<00:04:22.180> thicker<00:04:22.449> band<00:04:22.690> tip<00:04:22.960> here<00:04:23.169> too<00:04:23.319> it's

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
to have a thicker band tip here too it's

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.499 
to have a thicker band tip here too it's
not<00:04:23.620> artificial<00:04:24.130> hair<00:04:24.520> it's<00:04:24.850> probably

not artificial hair it's probably

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:27.900
