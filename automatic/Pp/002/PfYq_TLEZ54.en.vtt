number<00:00:14.470> five<00:00:14.830> we're<00:00:15.100> going<00:00:15.250> to<00:00:15.370> see<00:00:15.520> how<00:00:15.730> to

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:15.790 
number five we're going to see how to

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.380 
number five we're going to see how to
draw<00:00:16.470> octagons<00:00:18.060> circumscribed<00:00:19.060> about<00:00:19.360> a

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:19.390 
draw octagons circumscribed about a

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.100 
draw octagons circumscribed about a
circle<00:00:20.910> basically<00:00:21.910> it's<00:00:22.330> a<00:00:22.360> lot<00:00:22.540> like<00:00:22.750> drawing

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:23.110 
circle basically it's a lot like drawing

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.410 
circle basically it's a lot like drawing
a<00:00:23.170> hexagon<00:00:23.680> except<00:00:24.070> you're<00:00:24.250> using<00:00:24.460> your<00:00:24.820> 45

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:25.420 
a hexagon except you're using your 45

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.480 
a hexagon except you're using your 45
degree<00:00:25.780> triangle<00:00:26.050> instead<00:00:26.500> of<00:00:26.590> your<00:00:26.740> 30<00:00:26.980> 60

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:27.490 
degree triangle instead of your 30 60

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.290 
degree triangle instead of your 30 60
degree<00:00:27.820> triangle<00:00:28.949> but<00:00:29.949> again<00:00:30.250> you<00:00:30.520> line<00:00:31.270> up

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300 
degree triangle but again you line up

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.960 
degree triangle but again you line up
tangent<00:00:32.169> with<00:00:32.739> one<00:00:33.340> edge<00:00:33.660> of<00:00:34.660> the<00:00:35.580> circle<00:00:36.580> and

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:36.970 
tangent with one edge of the circle and

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.950 
tangent with one edge of the circle and
lay<00:00:37.960> out<00:00:37.989> a<00:00:38.140> construction<00:00:38.769> line<00:00:39.780> comes<00:00:40.780> down

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:40.960 
lay out a construction line comes down

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.130 
lay out a construction line comes down
to<00:00:41.110> the<00:00:41.230> other<00:00:41.410> adjacent<00:00:42.070> side<00:00:42.640> of<00:00:42.820> the<00:00:42.910> circle

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.290 

another<00:00:47.140> construction<00:00:47.680> line<00:00:48.120> flip<00:00:49.120> your

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
another construction line flip your

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:56.190 
another construction line flip your
triangle<00:00:49.719> over<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:53.010> on<00:00:54.010> the<00:00:54.160> top<00:00:54.399> side<00:00:55.200> draw

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:56.200 
triangle over and on the top side draw

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.150 
triangle over and on the top side draw
another<00:00:56.500> 45<00:00:57.040> degree<00:00:57.340> angle<00:00:57.670> and<00:00:58.170> then<00:00:59.170> on<00:00:59.950> the

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160 
another 45 degree angle and then on the

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.829 
another 45 degree angle and then on the
opposite<00:01:00.579> side<00:01:01.170> another<00:01:02.170> 45<00:01:02.680> degree<00:01:02.950> angle

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:03.839 
opposite side another 45 degree angle

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:06.540 
opposite side another 45 degree angle
this<00:01:04.839> we're<00:01:05.379> going<00:01:05.500> to<00:01:05.560> use<00:01:05.680> our<00:01:05.800> parallel<00:01:06.280> bar

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:06.550 
this we're going to use our parallel bar

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.440 
this we're going to use our parallel bar
and<00:01:07.270> draw<00:01:07.509> a<00:01:07.570> horizontal<00:01:07.840> line<00:01:08.289> at<00:01:08.560> the<00:01:08.680> top<00:01:09.450> we

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
and draw a horizontal line at the top we

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.760 
and draw a horizontal line at the top we
circle<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:12.100> come<00:01:12.340> down<00:01:12.550> at<00:01:12.700> the<00:01:12.789> bottom<00:01:13.060> or

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
circle and come down at the bottom or

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.330 
circle and come down at the bottom or
the<00:01:14.770> circle<00:01:15.340> draw<00:01:16.030> horizontal<00:01:16.300> line<00:01:16.840> and<00:01:17.740> then

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
the circle draw horizontal line and then

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:24.499 
the circle draw horizontal line and then
vertical<00:01:18.819> lines<00:01:19.679> each<00:01:21.360> side<00:01:22.360> of<00:01:23.140> the<00:01:23.319> circle

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
vertical lines each side of the circle

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.089 
vertical lines each side of the circle
and<00:01:25.509> again<00:01:25.990> I<00:01:26.020> suggest<00:01:26.470> you<00:01:26.530> lay<00:01:26.740> these<00:01:26.920> out

00:01:27.089 --> 00:01:27.099 
and again I suggest you lay these out

00:01:27.099 --> 00:01:29.070 
and again I suggest you lay these out
with<00:01:27.369> construction<00:01:27.880> lines<00:01:28.179> with<00:01:28.450> like<00:01:28.569> a<00:01:28.599> 6-h

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
with construction lines with like a 6-h

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.650 
with construction lines with like a 6-h
pencil<00:01:29.560> and<00:01:30.399> go<00:01:30.580> back<00:01:30.819> and<00:01:31.060> darken<00:01:31.330> again

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.660 
pencil and go back and darken again

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.529 
pencil and go back and darken again
after<00:01:32.080> you<00:01:32.229> two<00:01:32.410> figured<00:01:32.740> out<00:01:32.860> where<00:01:33.069> the

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:33.539 
after you two figured out where the

00:01:33.539 --> 00:02:01.620 
after you two figured out where the
lines<00:01:34.539> need<00:01:35.200> to<00:01:35.229> go

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.130 

and<00:02:02.630> then<00:02:02.780> finally<00:02:03.020> the<00:02:03.380> vertical<00:02:03.800> lines<00:02:05.140> work

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
and then finally the vertical lines work

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.700 
and then finally the vertical lines work
on<00:02:06.260> those<00:02:06.380> in<00:02:09.880> we<00:02:10.880> should<00:02:11.060> have<00:02:11.210> a<00:02:11.240> nice

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
on those in we should have a nice

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.710 
on those in we should have a nice
octagon
