sixteen<00:01:44.340> someone<00:01:45.270> getting<00:01:45.420> saved<00:01:45.750> there<00:01:46.520> it's

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
sixteen someone getting saved there it's

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.740 
sixteen someone getting saved there it's
conceivable<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.240> holy<00:01:48.420> spirit<00:01:48.479> can

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
conceivable that the holy spirit can

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:49.940 
conceivable that the holy spirit can
work<00:01:48.869> i<00:01:48.930> think<00:01:48.960> it<00:01:49.200> says<00:01:49.350> that<00:01:49.590> we're<00:01:49.770> born

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
work i think it says that we're born

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.580 
work i think it says that we're born
again<00:01:50.159> not<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.369> corruptible<00:01:50.659> seed<00:01:51.659> but<00:01:52.500> if

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
again not of corruptible seed but if

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.469 
again not of corruptible seed but if
incorruptible<00:01:52.920> see<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.520> word<00:01:53.729> of<00:01:53.909> god<00:01:54.119> is<00:01:54.299> not

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
incorruptible see the word of god is not

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.859 
incorruptible see the word of god is not
bound<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.290> so<00:01:55.740> there<00:01:56.100> are<00:01:56.219> lots<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:56.869> King

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
bound and so there are lots of King

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.920 
bound and so there are lots of King
James<00:01:58.170> seeds<00:01:58.860> going<00:01:59.520> around<00:01:59.820> out<00:02:00.149> there<00:02:00.180> you

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
James seeds going around out there you

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.389 
James seeds going around out there you
know<00:02:01.020> people<00:02:01.380> say<00:02:01.560> it<00:02:01.649> on<00:02:01.770> that<00:02:01.920> even<00:02:02.250> if<00:02:02.340> they

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
know people say it on that even if they

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.440 
know people say it on that even if they
don't<00:02:02.490> use<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.820> new<00:02:02.909> versions<00:02:03.240> just
