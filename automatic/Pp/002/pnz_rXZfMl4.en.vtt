00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
on YouTube the guy left it outside for a

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.539 
on YouTube the guy left it outside for a
full<00:01:27.689> rainy<00:01:28.140> day<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:28.710> was<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:28.829> puddle<00:01:29.340> in

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
full rainy day and it was a puddle in

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.480 
full rainy day and it was a puddle in
the<00:01:29.880> middle<00:01:30.060> here<00:01:30.570> so<00:01:30.990> yeah<00:01:31.829> it's<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.250> proof

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
the middle here so yeah it's a proof

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.880 
the middle here so yeah it's a proof
that<00:01:32.640> it's<00:01:32.820> fully<00:01:33.030> waterproof<00:01:33.390> as<00:01:33.689> well<00:01:33.900> okay

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
that it's fully waterproof as well okay

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.020 
that it's fully waterproof as well okay
now<00:01:35.460> I<00:01:35.700> wouldn't<00:01:36.030> put<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.210> floor<00:01:36.600> mat<00:01:36.810> inside

now I wouldn't put a floor mat inside

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.850 
now I wouldn't put a floor mat inside
the<00:01:39.030> reason<00:01:39.479> is<00:01:39.659> is<00:01:39.990> because<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.470> doesn't<00:01:40.650> give

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
the reason is is because it doesn't give

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.030 
the reason is is because it doesn't give
you<00:01:40.950> enough<00:01:41.070> room<00:01:41.460> inside<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:43.170> mat<00:01:43.409> the
