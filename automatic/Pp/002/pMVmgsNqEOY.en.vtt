00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.630 
placing outside the top four hopefully
we<00:03:11.300> can<00:03:11.420> keep<00:03:11.570> that<00:03:11.750> streak<00:03:11.990> up<00:03:12.200> and<00:03:12.610> get<00:03:13.610> that

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
we can keep that streak up and get that

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:14.950 
we can keep that streak up and get that
chemistry<00:03:13.880> back<00:03:14.240> with<00:03:14.390> theory<00:03:14.600> there's<00:03:14.750> a<00:03:14.810> lot

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:14.960 
chemistry back with theory there's a lot

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.030 
chemistry back with theory there's a lot
of<00:03:14.990> people<00:03:15.260> saying<00:03:15.440> this<00:03:15.560> seems<00:03:15.740> going<00:03:15.890> to<00:03:15.950> be

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
of people saying this seems going to be

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
going to have to see I don't think it's

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.010 
going to have to see I don't think it's
going<00:03:21.410> to<00:03:21.500> flop<00:03:21.710> at<00:03:21.860> all<00:03:21.950> obviously<00:03:22.900> we<00:03:23.900> have

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020 
going to flop at all obviously we have

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:25.720 
going to flop at all obviously we have
good<00:03:24.410> chemistry<00:03:24.470> with<00:03:24.950> Dylan<00:03:25.250> or<00:03:25.370> snd<00:03:25.670> is

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
good chemistry with Dylan or snd is

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.699 
good chemistry with Dylan or snd is
going<00:03:25.880> to<00:03:25.940> be<00:03:26.000> a<00:03:26.060> lot<00:03:26.180> better<00:03:26.330> I<00:03:26.660> could<00:03:27.470> pick<00:03:27.590> up

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
going to be a lot better I could pick up

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:29.350 
going to be a lot better I could pick up
the<00:03:27.830> slack<00:03:27.950> and<00:03:28.070> respawn<00:03:28.610> and<00:03:28.880> when<00:03:29.090> it<00:03:29.180> comes

to slain that app the head I can

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.440 
to slain that app the head I can
definitely<00:03:31.370> do<00:03:31.700> that<00:03:31.730> I'm<00:03:31.970> up<00:03:32.120> for<00:03:32.270> the

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
definitely do that I'm up for the

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
if we make it into champ rocky we were

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:00.970 
if we make it into champ rocky we were
not<00:03:58.970> doing<00:03:59.120> that<00:03:59.239> again<00:03:59.410> team<00:04:00.410> house<00:04:00.590> is<00:04:00.770> even

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
not doing that again team house is even

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.740 
not doing that again team house is even
up<00:04:01.070> for<00:04:01.100> discussion<00:04:01.310> with<00:04:01.940> team<00:04:02.150> kaliber<00:04:02.510> I

being<00:06:10.419> said<00:06:10.509> that's<00:06:10.930> my<00:06:11.050> opinion<00:06:11.199> on<00:06:11.379> the

00:06:11.429 --> 00:06:11.439 
being said that's my opinion on the

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:12.869 
being said that's my opinion on the
ruleset<00:06:11.620> I<00:06:11.800> believe<00:06:12.129> that<00:06:12.159> the<00:06:12.339> pros<00:06:12.550> should

00:06:12.869 --> 00:06:12.879 
ruleset I believe that the pros should

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:14.670 
ruleset I believe that the pros should
have<00:06:13.269> the<00:06:13.419> ability<00:06:13.509> to<00:06:13.959> decide<00:06:14.409> if<00:06:14.529> we're

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:14.680 
have the ability to decide if we're

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:15.959 
have the ability to decide if we're
playing<00:06:14.800> or<00:06:15.129> not<00:06:15.159> playing<00:06:15.580> with<00:06:15.699> certain

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:15.969 
playing or not playing with certain

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:18.179 
playing or not playing with certain
things<00:06:16.120> I<00:06:16.659> don't<00:06:17.469> think<00:06:17.620> we<00:06:17.680> completely

00:06:18.179 --> 00:06:18.189 
things I don't think we completely

00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:20.489 
things I don't think we completely
decide<00:06:18.610> on<00:06:18.789> you<00:06:19.089> know<00:06:19.180> polls<00:06:19.479> and<00:06:19.689> votes<00:06:19.870> but<00:06:20.439> I

00:06:20.489 --> 00:06:20.499 
decide on you know polls and votes but I

00:06:20.499 --> 00:06:22.199 
decide on you know polls and votes but I
think<00:06:20.800> that<00:06:20.979> we<00:06:21.099> have<00:06:21.219> a<00:06:21.249> good<00:06:21.519> say<00:06:21.789> and<00:06:22.059> what

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:22.209 
think that we have a good say and what

00:06:22.209 --> 00:06:24.989 
think that we have a good say and what
needs<00:06:22.330> to<00:06:22.479> happen<00:06:22.509> and<00:06:23.759> instead<00:06:24.759> of<00:06:24.819> just

00:06:24.989 --> 00:06:24.999 
needs to happen and instead of just

00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:26.100 
needs to happen and instead of just
banning<00:06:25.330> stuff<00:06:25.539> let's<00:06:25.689> just<00:06:25.839> go<00:06:25.930> to<00:06:25.990> the

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:26.110 
banning stuff let's just go to the

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:27.269 
banning stuff let's just go to the
developer<00:06:26.499> of<00:06:26.529> the<00:06:26.620> game<00:06:26.800> and<00:06:26.889> hopefully<00:06:27.039> they

00:06:27.269 --> 00:06:27.279 
developer of the game and hopefully they

00:06:27.279 --> 00:06:28.889 
developer of the game and hopefully they
can<00:06:27.339> patch<00:06:27.580> this<00:06:27.789> stuff<00:06:27.999> but<00:06:28.180> it<00:06:28.389> is<00:06:28.539> too<00:06:28.719> late

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:28.899 
can patch this stuff but it is too late

00:06:28.899 --> 00:06:30.949

00:06:33.329 --> 00:06:33.339 
the Deb supports there it just takes a

00:06:33.339 --> 00:06:35.279
