00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 Today is the third time the innotec 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.799
 the city an event of edag 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.349
 group to suppliers from the fields 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.450
 Lightweight construction and electromobility here after 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.650
 Fulda to pick up our engineers 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.510
 to give an update what in these two 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.820
 separates areas of electromobility and 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.820
 lightweight construction is possible we see it as 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.590
 a very important success component 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.539
 that I am in difficult service 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.099
 and suppliers from the field of lightweight construction 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.820
 and electromobility with each other 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.270
 to chat 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.829
 because only in the interplay between 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.670
 suppliers and 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.070
 We can provide development service providers 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.050
 Make sure that these technologies are too 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.600
 conclusive vehicle concepts in series 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.860
 be implemented 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.940
 and I was very happy 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.520
 a bit proud 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.230
 However, this is always to look very 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.690
 to get interesting companies to us 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.399
 to talk with us and 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.840
 future uses possibility of their 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.840
 great products and go 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.110
 Of course, lightweight construction is one thing 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.659
 big topic now in the automotive sector 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.090
 and our products actually provide 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.500
 the possibility of different 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.580
 different materials speak steel 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:36.700
 speak aluminum speak cfk recyclables 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:39.310
 to connect with each other and so too 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.200
 the well-trodden paths, for example 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.350
 welding switzerland mother sweat 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.580
 bolt and so on leaving ours 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.450
 products are very strong 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.860
 in need of explanation and we are looking for the 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.100
 contacts to the development departments 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.810
 to the developers and there is the company 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.140
 eder course a very strong partner 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.140
 for us 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.590
 Carbon is yes I want to say that 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:16.660
 Royal class of lightweight construction or one 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.730
 very prominent material but also 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.819
 This is where steady innovation takes place 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.739
 which evolutionary stages of carbon fibers 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.019
 composite materials you have us this 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:27.099
 year brought with now of course is goal 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:28.599
 of the cable and com possesses in 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.420
 industrial breakthrough high performance 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:33.640
 to promote fiber composite structures in 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.670
 to apply and to the second 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.379
 Of course, too 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.120
 Kunststofftechnik also strengthens the 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:44.380
 to promote mixed construction 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:47.549
 so we appreciate this trio mdl and 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.420
 Manufacturers like you are sort of 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:51.790
 according to experience of the projects 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.370
 we push with us too 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.500
 Partners together, both are great 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.049
 topic there are development projects 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.549
 very specifically directly with the oem the 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:02.470
 means there we will jump too 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:03.610
 develops complete series processes 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.650
 are probably due to components 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.269
 structures of complete processes too 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.430
 serial tires about children sanyo m 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.900
 but of course it also happens that one 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.579
 with the development service provider for 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.590
 example things specifically developed the 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:17.620
 the development service provider through a 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:20.470
 wider front one oem it then of course 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.239
 I would like to offer both 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.109
 that would be 50 50 is that 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.389
 both very fertile 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:26.590
 Of course, there are projects where everyone 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:28.600
 three sitting with a table 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.079
 But that's the structure of the project 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.079
 owing 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:57.660
 yes you have me the technology of 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:04:00.000
 red-red blanks could be brought here 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.950
 does a bit of educational work 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.870
 say our development specialists 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:07.080
 this technology was already clever 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.050
 keep all known so we stand 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.160
 already very much in contact with 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.990
 medak people what this technology 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.700
 There are already some 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:17.580
 experts with whom one could again 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.859
 clarify some detail questions and and one 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.860
 I refresh some things and it 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:23.850
 also gave some newer colleagues the 

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:25.950
 songs do not have much contact with 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.630
 had and thought it was a good one 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.780
 point to bring that closer to 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.780
 can 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.870
 the innotec is one 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.000
 event with us also employees 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.620
 We're smart at what is currently state of 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.260
 the art is what new materials 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.040
 Methods processes in the market 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.290
 Are available 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.270
 I'll ask you joachim for you in 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:21.040
 your work area which stood 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.480
 which theme has you here especially 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.490
 impressed today 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.650
 So I have a company for me 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.210
 found a tool for me 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:31.360
 hand gives me with the relatively fast 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.260
 a component costing 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.820
 can perform 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.320
 I can not do that and that would be 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.380
 great when it comes to use 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:40.900
 could in my daily work yes 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:43.210
 nice that the innotec de its purpose 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:45.580
 has fulfilled namely that we are adding new 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:47.440
 Get to know the tools we do operationally 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:50.490
 in our daily development work 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.490
 can use
