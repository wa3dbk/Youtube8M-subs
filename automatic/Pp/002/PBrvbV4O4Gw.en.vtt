left<00:03:33.830> to<00:03:33.920> be<00:03:34.040> off<00:03:34.160> your<00:03:34.190> screen<00:03:34.580> and<00:03:34.970> it's<00:03:35.180> kind

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
left to be off your screen and it's kind

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:36.820 
left to be off your screen and it's kind
of<00:03:35.510> moving<00:03:35.720> a<00:03:35.870> little<00:03:36.020> towards<00:03:36.380> the<00:03:36.530> middle

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
of moving a little towards the middle

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.800 
of moving a little towards the middle
again<00:03:37.100> so<00:03:37.340> maybe<00:03:37.580> they<00:03:37.790> said<00:03:38.030> some<00:03:38.270> margaritas

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810
