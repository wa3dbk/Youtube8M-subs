think<00:01:54.240> you<00:01:54.299> can<00:01:54.450> just<00:01:54.600> go<00:01:54.750> out<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:54.899> buy<00:01:55.229> a

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
think you can just go out and buy a

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.620 
think you can just go out and buy a
better<00:01:55.560> world<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:56.130> in<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.460> lot<00:01:56.579> of<00:01:56.640> cases<00:01:56.939> I<00:01:57.270> try

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
better world and in a lot of cases I try

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.719 
better world and in a lot of cases I try
to<00:01:57.659> not<00:01:58.079> buy<00:01:58.350> things<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:59.040> doesn't<00:01:59.189> always<00:01:59.430> turn

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
to not buy things it doesn't always turn

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.850 
to not buy things it doesn't always turn
out<00:01:59.880> but<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:00.210> think<00:02:00.570> it's<00:02:01.110> pretty<00:02:01.350> great<00:02:01.619> also

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
out but I think it's pretty great also

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.800 
out but I think it's pretty great also
if<00:02:02.159> we<00:02:02.189> can<00:02:02.430> just<00:02:02.579> make<00:02:02.759> our<00:02:02.939> own<00:02:02.969> things<00:02:03.450> or

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
if we can just make our own things or

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.770 
if we can just make our own things or
find<00:02:04.079> things<00:02:04.409> reuse<00:02:05.399> things<00:02:05.729> or<00:02:06.090> just<00:02:06.149> go

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
find things reuse things or just go

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.229 
find things reuse things or just go
without<00:02:07.049> a<00:02:07.229> certain<00:02:07.740> things<00:02:08.009> but<00:02:08.759> I<00:02:08.819> think<00:02:09.149> in

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
without a certain things but I think in

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.420 
without a certain things but I think in
the<00:02:09.330> case<00:02:09.509> where<00:02:09.810> you<00:02:09.869> do<00:02:10.319> wear<00:02:10.679> clothes<00:02:11.099> and

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
the case where you do wear clothes and

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.960 
the case where you do wear clothes and
if<00:02:11.550> you<00:02:11.640> need<00:02:11.790> more<00:02:11.970> clothes<00:02:12.239> there

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
if you need more clothes there

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.210 
if you need more clothes there
people<00:02:13.360> who<00:02:13.510> are<00:02:13.630> better<00:02:13.810> to<00:02:14.110> support<00:02:14.560> and<00:02:14.800> who

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.570 
to the white men in the business suits
and<00:02:58.390> can<00:02:58.810> be<00:02:58.930> tricky<00:02:59.290> because<00:02:59.470> it<00:02:59.980> seems<00:03:00.250> like

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
and can be tricky because it seems like

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.610 
and can be tricky because it seems like
such<00:03:01.030> a<00:03:01.060> cool<00:03:01.390> thing<00:03:01.420> and<00:03:02.080> such<00:03:02.260> a<00:03:02.290> cool<00:03:02.590> idea

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
such a cool thing and such a cool idea

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.770 
such a cool thing and such a cool idea
and<00:03:02.980> part<00:03:03.430> of<00:03:03.520> the<00:03:03.640> profits<00:03:04.030> go<00:03:04.120> to<00:03:04.240> a<00:03:04.450> women's

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
and part of the profits go to a women's

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.900 
and part of the profits go to a women's
organization<00:03:05.590> and<00:03:05.770> so<00:03:06.250> it<00:03:06.370> seems<00:03:06.580> like<00:03:06.760> it's

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
organization and so it seems like it's

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.660 
organization and so it seems like it's
really<00:03:07.060> benefiting<00:03:07.780> the<00:03:08.620> community<00:03:09.130> but<00:03:09.370> I
