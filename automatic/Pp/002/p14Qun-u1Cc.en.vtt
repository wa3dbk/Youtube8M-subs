00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:15.110
 greetings, people, how are you, good afternoon? 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:17.689
 here on the pedro de morais here on the avenue 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.800
 pedroso de morais street avenue and never 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:25.230
 about this 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:27.359
 n of the street sees from the street we will take this pain 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.140
 due to a v in the street girl avenue 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.140
 pedroso de morais 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:37.240
 The guy you 're seeing is different. 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.400
 to that way you are viewing a 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.410
 steering damper right 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.760
 Does a lot of what you 're thinking of putting 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.059
 other direction 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:49.629
 but as well but even though all of you 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:50.860
 the forums forums access other places 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:54.489
 to know about the shock absorbers 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.949
 direction as it also did the same thing 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:01:00.730
 see in the pros and cons of each one time 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:03.100
 We have good national products here. 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.140
 different prices and we are looking for 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.869
 a cane product the product of 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:12.040
 quality we found this buffer 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:13.690
 here from the camera is a very good option one 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.910
 European standard 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.899
 then it is different from some that have in 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.940
 Marketplace 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:20.649
 so people did not hit the road 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.720
 with him just put more like that 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:24.310
 we passed some ripples some 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.920
 places we usually were 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:30.660
 suffering a new attempt in doubt by 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:33.039
 example one that was diminished in the 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:38.560
 acceleration of the motorcycle or to have a little 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:40.569
 more care really helps a lot 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.310
 people, especially the one who has 

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:43.660
 bike that is a bit lighter 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.759
 I already had one and I know the need. 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.110
 to have a steering engine on the mac then 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:49.360
 so we will continue testing 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.700
 this damper good to see that we go 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.619
 to find in all the situations he already passes 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.130
 this feedback for you a business 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:56.130
 cool 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.570
 more news of the world's channel will 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.190
 do this test drive here buy one 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:09.229
 damper let's test now it's going to be 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:11.180
 good if it 's not good at all oops it's 20 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.420
 Galley settings 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.280
 then you can regulate the city ​​to the 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.880
 road but the disabled way 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:22.490
 even leaving in the hand heavier than 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.990
 road to china - and everything else 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:28.320
 he did not present 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:31.500
 It's hard for us to drive a motorcycle. 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.450
 This is very important, she is then. 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.350
 so it really helps very very much 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.810
 very 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.240
 and then I had been the feedback is perhaps 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.980
 One day we'll try to prove ourselves. 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.460
 behind to spread the word to you better there 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.050
 but really people are very nice to us 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.150
 will make the next videos there 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.530
 You guys on the road in Fernando Days 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.400
 places that used to not give a 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.740
 diminished 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.450
 the track patches in the ripples to 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.550
 you see how it works 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.080
 and really the quality of the product 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.210
 if it was not good or bad but we do not 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.900
 Go talk and if it's okay, we'll go. 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:05.120
 indicate why the crew 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.590
 how many a long time ago 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.610
 I did not want to change part 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.450
 the direction 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:14.299
 I wanted to find one of this model that already 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.400
 It is in this way that would not be so hard 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:17.750
 even at the maximum setting it is not 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.579
 up the hallway a lot of 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.799
 thing, that 's it then, guys, let's go 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:26.019
