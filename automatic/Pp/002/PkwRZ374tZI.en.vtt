00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.299
 6 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.950
 so 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:15.870
 marco coachman and liberty sun 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:15.870
 possible play 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:26.480
 once second with cornetz 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:29.360
 cristallo could jump the first one 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.500
 win youngster tour 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.050
 this three exam of the youngster tour 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.480

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:40.260
 by marco coachman and henrik 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.239
 from eckermann yesterday with cristallo like 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.530
 second said here as 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:49.580
 penultimate and the more betrayed 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.390
 he plans with liberty sun 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:57.479
 also a start at the german 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:59.519
 championships and has him so hard 

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:00.989
 like today in such a big big one 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:03.780
 Price not ridden yet 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.020
 used and then uses here now the 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:10.340
 Just take a look with him 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.530
 to take on this task 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.150
 a horse 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.700
 here is a great momentum 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:21.200
 that oliver lemmer in the 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:23.979
 has brought international sport and 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:30.159
 after then last year 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:30.159
 Paused due to injury remember 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:36.830
 get under the saddle and what 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.220
 the two show here is fun 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.220
 watch 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.210
 allowed me a little bit in the time 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.410
 But now we keep eye as well 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.030
 he is already four of us, of course 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:04.220
 with a time error in any case 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:07.010
 safe on and so it also comes who 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:10.970
 gets these substances success error 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:14.930
 but no problem with eighth 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.670
 So he shifts and that was 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.160
 it is already clear in the 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:23.510
 second round and then we see now 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:27.380
 still the winners of yesterday in the 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:30.280
 yesterday stab at it marco Thommes 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.280

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:37.220

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:42.670

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.670
 rules and julien budget for france 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.989
 exciting constellation 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:57.049

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:57.049
