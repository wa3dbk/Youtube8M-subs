with a stealth chopper an AGR which is
also<00:02:18.420> really<00:02:18.780> effective<00:02:19.319> but<00:02:20.010> I<00:02:20.189> wouldn't

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:20.579 
also really effective but I wouldn't

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:22.789 
also really effective but I wouldn't
really<00:02:20.879> go<00:02:21.090> any<00:02:21.269> higher<00:02:21.450> than<00:02:21.719> the<00:02:21.900> AGR<00:02:22.469> or

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
really go any higher than the AGR or

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:26.479 
really go any higher than the AGR or
even<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.849> escort<00:02:24.269> drone<00:02:24.799> because<00:02:25.799> you<00:02:26.249> rarely

even the escort drone because you rarely

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:28.829 
get them to be honest so that is the

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:31.039

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
best way and another i'm not sure if you

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.199 
best way and another i'm not sure if you

and if you like that then you could also

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.520 
and if you like that then you could also
put<00:02:54.090> on<00:02:54.209> the<00:02:54.329> counter<00:02:54.780> UAV<00:02:54.900> which<00:02:55.319> does

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
put on the counter UAV which does

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.399 
put on the counter UAV which does
exactly<00:02:55.709> the<00:02:56.129> same<00:02:56.159> with<00:02:56.939> an<00:02:57.090> ass<00:02:57.209> if<00:02:57.419> XP

00:02:58.399 --> 00:02:58.409 
exactly the same with an ass if XP

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:01.729 
exactly the same with an ass if XP
school<00:02:58.680> for<00:02:58.859> every<00:02:59.370> kill<00:02:59.639> and<00:02:59.909> so<00:03:00.900> another

for our attachment which you'll see my
other<00:03:28.739> video<00:03:29.069> and<00:03:29.250> the<00:03:29.489> best<00:03:29.699> assault<00:03:30.000> rifle

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359 
other video and the best assault rifle

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:33.619 
other video and the best assault rifle
in<00:03:30.449> the<00:03:30.509> game<00:03:30.689> and<00:03:31.669> so<00:03:32.669> yeah<00:03:32.849> I<00:03:33.030> would<00:03:33.209> use<00:03:33.419> them

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:33.629 
in the game and so yeah I would use them

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:35.809 
in the game and so yeah I would use them
assault<00:03:34.590> rifles<00:03:34.859> or<00:03:34.979> some<00:03:35.159> shingles<00:03:35.400> at<00:03:35.699> this

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
assault rifles or some shingles at this

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.030 
assault rifles or some shingles at this
time<00:03:36.030> or<00:03:36.269> although<00:03:37.019> sniping<00:03:37.709> is<00:03:37.829> quite

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
time or although sniping is quite

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.099 
time or although sniping is quite
effective<00:03:38.099> but<00:03:39.060> anyway<00:03:39.419> the<00:03:39.599> reason<00:03:39.750> for<00:03:40.079> that

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
effective but anyway the reason for that

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:42.860 
effective but anyway the reason for that
is<00:03:40.349> because<00:03:40.379> you<00:03:41.150> get<00:03:42.150> the<00:03:42.269> most<00:03:42.419> kills<00:03:42.689> with

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
is because you get the most kills with

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.080 
is because you get the most kills with
them<00:03:43.019> weapons<00:03:43.430> although<00:03:44.430> light<00:03:44.639> machine<00:03:44.909> guns

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
them weapons although light machine guns

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.819 
them weapons although light machine guns
can<00:03:45.359> begin<00:03:45.629> this<00:03:45.750> game<00:03:45.959> 2<00:03:46.169> with<00:03:46.500> a<00:03:46.560> target

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
can begin this game 2 with a target

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:48.439 
can begin this game 2 with a target
finder<00:03:47.069> you<00:03:47.549> do<00:03:47.790> actually<00:03:47.970> get<00:03:48.180> the<00:03:48.299> most

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:48.449 
finder you do actually get the most

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:49.939 
finder you do actually get the most
kills<00:03:48.689> with<00:03:48.870> assault<00:03:49.109> rifles<00:03:49.139> and<00:03:49.560> submachine

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:49.949

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:52.849 
kills with assault rifles and submachine
guns<00:03:50.310> and<00:03:50.629> if<00:03:51.629> you<00:03:51.989> get<00:03:52.139> the<00:03:52.259> chance<00:03:52.290> if<00:03:52.709> you've

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:11.129 
it's also pretty good when you prestige

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:12.649 
it's also pretty good when you prestige

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.630 
teammates will be using ghost so you'll

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.060

be the only red dot appearing on the
enemy's<00:05:44.370> map<00:05:44.610> if<00:05:44.820> you<00:05:45.150> don't<00:05:45.480> find<00:05:45.630> that<00:05:45.720> so

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
enemy's map if you don't find that so

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.120 
enemy's map if you don't find that so

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600 
you'll just end up going negative most

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.280 
you'll just end up going negative most
games<00:05:48.870> so<00:05:49.650> don't<00:05:50.640> vary<00:05:50.910> perkone<00:05:51.780> unless<00:05:52.140> you

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:52.290 
games so don't vary perkone unless you

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:54.200 
games so don't vary perkone unless you
put<00:05:52.440> a<00:05:52.470> wild<00:05:52.800> card<00:05:52.950> on<00:05:53.160> it<00:05:53.280> but<00:05:53.880> what<00:05:54.060> I<00:05:54.090> will

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.210 
put a wild card on it but what I will

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:57.440 
put a wild card on it but what I will
say<00:05:54.390> is<00:05:54.600> um<00:05:55.490> vary<00:05:56.490> between<00:05:56.700> pepto<00:05:57.330> and

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:57.450 
say is um vary between pepto and

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:00.020 
say is um vary between pepto and
pet-free<00:05:57.870> for<00:05:58.620> example<00:05:59.130> dexterity<00:05:59.910> and

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:00.030 
pet-free for example dexterity and

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.480 
pet-free for example dexterity and
extreme<00:06:00.540> conditioning<00:06:01.110> to<00:06:01.890> you<00:06:02.040> could<00:06:02.220> vary

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490 
extreme conditioning to you could vary

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.960 
extreme conditioning to you could vary
