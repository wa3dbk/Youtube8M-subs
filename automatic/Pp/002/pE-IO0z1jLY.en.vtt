00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:07.520
 pescara evening is trop phishing like 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.800
 we have repeatedly said fishing with 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.620
 therefore very ultralight equipment 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.720
 read thin, leaded heads 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.789
 frames explicit drop shot very much 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.369
 read aimed at those who are i 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:21.859
 small marine predators but usable 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.509
 even if only 3 usable by itself 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:25.819
 Also for all perch fishing 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:28.399
 they chill in inland waters therefore 

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:30.199
 really ample space for use e 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:30.919
 a lot of fun especially the views 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:33.020
 facility 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:36.590
 we found a spotlight we are in one 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.770
 session nature and we make a trigger of 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:42.290
 this silicone produced by the company 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:44.510
 nipponica reigns we chose this 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.910
 these water because it can reproduce a 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.070
 forage fish view the silhouette has 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.100
 even a small worm but above all 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.079
 thanks to the tail type group e 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.660
 puts a lot of vibrations and therefore 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:57.920
 we will be able to make it work on the bottom 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.050
 recalling the predator also from 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.820
 distant so we'll try though 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.519
 predator is not active to get it out 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.049
 from the den thanks to which precisely i 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.780
 small reminders that we will put with the 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:10.340
 This barrel will vibrate and yes 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.369
 will move it looks like a nap that 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.380
 wall crowd on the bottom and look for food 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.270
 on the bottom and then the scorpion fish the bulk 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.819
 any predator that has any 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.679
 attracted will be captured by capture 

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:24.350
 he will eat it because he believes it 

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:26.689
 a defenseless prey 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.549
 now let's go with the mount 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:30.819
 let's go to the head together in the art 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:30.819
 ficial 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.940
 then we will immediately try it, let's say 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.340
 whole so without bringing any 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.720
 change if we see that it is one 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.180
 representation a little too arrogant 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.340
 a little too big we can cut the 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.100
 first part the part not the honeydew 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.260
 this part here and make it slightly 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.869
 smaller in order to favor the 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.700
 eat even shorter and this 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.770
 especially in the presence of fish 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.080
 and listless fish that eats eats badly 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.640
 but we will go now to try to 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.160
 stimulate it with greatness try to 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.200
 let's make a little selection let's mount it 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.800
 on our head give me who comes down in 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.800
 this case
