be<00:00:23.930> confused<00:00:24.109> with<00:00:24.380> ketoacidosis<00:00:25.060> but<00:00:26.060> this

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
be confused with ketoacidosis but this

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.150 
be confused with ketoacidosis but this
is<00:00:26.390> where<00:00:26.539> the<00:00:26.689> body<00:00:26.930> is<00:00:27.050> burning<00:00:27.500> fat<00:00:27.920> as

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 
is where the body is burning fat as

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.120 
is where the body is burning fat as
energy<00:00:28.550> and<00:00:28.789> you<00:00:29.720> become<00:00:30.019> fat<00:00:30.289> fueled<00:00:30.650> so

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
energy and you become fat fueled so

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.399 
energy and you become fat fueled so
you're<00:00:31.670> using<00:00:31.849> either<00:00:32.149> your<00:00:32.479> body<00:00:32.689> fat<00:00:32.989> or<00:00:33.260> the

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:33.409 
you're using either your body fat or the

00:00:33.409 --> 00:00:35.139 
you're using either your body fat or the
fats<00:00:33.620> you're<00:00:33.889> eating<00:00:34.159> as<00:00:34.339> energy<00:00:34.850> to<00:00:34.969> feel

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:35.149 
fats you're eating as energy to feel

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:37.180 
fats you're eating as energy to feel
your<00:00:35.329> day<00:00:35.510> so<00:00:35.960> if<00:00:36.079> you're<00:00:36.199> already<00:00:36.350> fat<00:00:36.800> this

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
your day so if you're already fat this

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.399 
your day so if you're already fat this
is<00:00:37.339> good<00:00:37.579> exact<00:00:38.420> I<00:00:38.569> don't<00:00:38.749> have<00:00:38.839> to<00:00:38.960> worry<00:00:39.139> too

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:39.409 
is good exact I don't have to worry too

00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:41.229 
is good exact I don't have to worry too
much<00:00:39.440> exactly<00:00:40.280> so<00:00:40.519> there's<00:00:40.760> two<00:00:41.030> different

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
much exactly so there's two different

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:42.879 
much exactly so there's two different
types<00:00:41.539> of<00:00:41.659> fuels<00:00:41.929> your<00:00:42.109> body<00:00:42.319> can<00:00:42.589> run<00:00:42.739> off<00:00:42.859> of

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:42.889 
types of fuels your body can run off of

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:45.579 
types of fuels your body can run off of
one<00:00:43.280> is<00:00:43.429> carbohydrates<00:00:44.210> like<00:00:44.479> sugar<00:00:44.870> fruit

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:45.589 
one is carbohydrates like sugar fruit

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:48.369 
one is carbohydrates like sugar fruit
starchy<00:00:46.159> carbohydrates<00:00:46.909> like<00:00:47.239> potatoes<00:00:47.839> corn

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379 
starchy carbohydrates like potatoes corn

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:50.770 
starchy carbohydrates like potatoes corn

we have our fats a little bit of

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.739 
we have our fats a little bit of
carbohydrate<00:01:31.189> in<00:01:31.700> there<00:01:31.939> so<00:01:32.420> because<00:01:32.539> they

00:01:32.739 --> 00:01:32.749 
carbohydrate in there so because they
