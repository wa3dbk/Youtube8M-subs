in<00:00:00.149> this<00:00:01.140> video<00:00:01.350> we're<00:00:01.650> going<00:00:01.800> to<00:00:01.949> be<00:00:02.070> taking<00:00:02.190> a

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
in this video we're going to be taking a

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.100 
in this video we're going to be taking a
look<00:00:02.520> at<00:00:02.669> something<00:00:02.909> I<00:00:03.270> have<00:00:03.570> gotten<00:00:03.899> quite<00:00:04.080> a

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
look at something I have gotten quite a

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.589 
look at something I have gotten quite a
few<00:00:04.259> questions<00:00:04.830> about<00:00:05.359> that<00:00:06.359> being<00:00:06.810> the

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:08.599 
few questions about that being the

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:11.990 
few questions about that being the
different<00:00:09.599> attribute<00:00:10.019> attributes<00:00:11.000> weapons

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
different attribute attributes weapons

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.629 
different attribute attributes weapons
have<00:00:12.500> but<00:00:13.500> I'm<00:00:13.620> primarily<00:00:13.889> going<00:00:14.340> to<00:00:14.519> be

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
have but I'm primarily going to be

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.620 
have but I'm primarily going to be
talking<00:00:14.849> about<00:00:15.210> here<00:00:15.570> is<00:00:15.800> weapon<00:00:16.800> length<00:00:17.130> and

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.630 
talking about here is weapon length and

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.490 
talking about here is weapon length and
how<00:00:18.630> that<00:00:18.690> affects<00:00:19.439> things<00:00:20.900> now<00:00:21.900> I<00:00:22.230> have

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
how that affects things now I have

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.290 
how that affects things now I have
sorted<00:00:22.890> weapons<00:00:23.250> by<00:00:23.400> length<00:00:23.640> hair<00:00:23.880> this<00:00:24.090> might

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
sorted weapons by length hair this might

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.390 
sorted weapons by length hair this might
be<00:00:24.510> too<00:00:24.720> small<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:25.289> see<00:00:25.650> depending<00:00:26.250> on<00:00:26.250> your

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
be too small to see depending on your

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.689 
be too small to see depending on your
monitor<00:00:26.789> size<00:00:27.000> but<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.660> top<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.890> top<00:00:29.099> weapon

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
monitor size but the top the top weapon

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.040 
monitor size but the top the top weapon
here<00:00:29.880> is<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.179> pike<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:30.689> has<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:30.840> weapon

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
here is the pike and it has a weapon

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.770 
here is the pike and it has a weapon
length<00:00:31.410> of<00:00:31.650> five<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.940> what<00:00:33.000> that<00:00:33.300> means<00:00:33.540> is

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
length of five and what that means is

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.729 
length of five and what that means is
that<00:00:33.870> in<00:00:34.770> meters<00:00:35.610> this<00:00:36.300> is<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.989> range<00:00:37.230> that

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
that in meters this is the range that

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.799 
that in meters this is the range that
weapon<00:00:38.219> is<00:00:38.370> able<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:38.940> effect<00:00:39.570> an<00:00:39.750> enemy<00:00:40.050> in<00:00:40.230> the

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
weapon is able to effect an enemy in the

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:45.440 
weapon is able to effect an enemy in the
Dana<00:00:42.809> acts<00:00:43.079> as<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.260> weapon<00:00:43.950> length<00:00:44.550> of<00:00:44.760> two<00:00:45.180> and

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
Dana acts as a weapon length of two and

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.229 
Dana acts as a weapon length of two and
what<00:00:46.020> that<00:00:46.050> means<00:00:46.469> is<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:46.829> each<00:00:47.340> unit<00:00:47.879> has<00:00:47.910> an

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
what that means is that each unit has an

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.650 
what that means is that each unit has an
attack<00:00:48.570> radius<00:00:49.079> so<00:00:49.950> it's<00:00:50.280> each<00:00:50.579> cylinder<00:00:51.329> on

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
attack radius so it's each cylinder on

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.330 
attack radius so it's each cylinder on
the<00:00:51.840> battlefield<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.770> units<00:00:53.129> are

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
the battlefield the the units are

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.490 
the battlefield the the units are
represented<00:00:53.940> as<00:00:53.969> I'm<00:00:54.719> calling<00:00:55.020> its<00:00:55.140> cylinders

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
represented as I'm calling its cylinders

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.319 
represented as I'm calling its cylinders
there<00:00:55.770> are<00:00:55.920> different<00:00:56.460> different<00:00:57.030> shapes

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
there are different different shapes

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.630 
there are different different shapes
there<00:00:57.600> are<00:00:57.750> ellipses<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.500> all<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.309> other

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
there are ellipses and all the other

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.630 
there are ellipses and all the other
things<00:01:00.030> but<00:01:00.719> each<00:01:00.980> each<00:01:01.980> man<00:01:02.370> on<00:01:02.550> the

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
things but each each man on the

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.429 
things but each each man on the
battlefield<00:01:03.059> has<00:01:03.239> certain<00:01:03.780> attack<00:01:04.019> radius

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
battlefield has certain attack radius

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.740 
battlefield has certain attack radius
where<00:01:04.739> if<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.159> unit<00:01:05.489> makes<00:01:05.760> it<00:01:05.970> inside<00:01:06.479> his

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
where if a unit makes it inside his

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.960 
where if a unit makes it inside his
attack<00:01:07.020> radius<00:01:07.380> then<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.340> has<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.490> chance<00:01:08.790> of

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
attack radius then it has a chance of

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.730 
attack radius then it has a chance of
triggering<00:01:09.420> an<00:01:09.630> attack<00:01:09.930> not<00:01:09.960> an<00:01:10.350> animation

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
triggering an attack not an animation

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.910 
triggering an attack not an animation
that<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.400> see<00:01:11.610> on<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.420> battlefield<00:01:13.020> just

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
that you see on the battlefield just

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.570 
that you see on the battlefield just
triggering<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:15.000> role<00:01:15.240> for<00:01:15.270> an<00:01:15.750> attack<00:01:16.220> so<00:01:17.220> the

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
triggering a role for an attack so the

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.050 
triggering a role for an attack so the
bigger<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.970> range<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.780> weapon<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.439> more

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
bigger the range of a weapon the more

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.460 
bigger the range of a weapon the more
theoretically<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.360> more<00:01:21.570> units<00:01:22.049> are<00:01:22.229> going

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
theoretically the more units are going

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.320 
theoretically the more units are going
to<00:01:22.590> be<00:01:22.710> able<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:23.220> have<00:01:23.460> their<00:01:23.670> attack<00:01:23.970> radiuses

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
to be able to have their attack radiuses

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.050 
to be able to have their attack radiuses
overlap<00:01:24.900> enemies<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:26.369> more<00:01:26.549> units<00:01:26.939> are

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
overlap enemies and the more units are

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.359 
overlap enemies and the more units are
going<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.390> be<00:01:27.509> able<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.990> have<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.650> chance<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.100> get

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
going to be able to have a chance to get

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.649 
going to be able to have a chance to get
an<00:01:29.579> attack<00:01:30.380> against<00:01:31.380> an<00:01:31.470> enemy<00:01:32.299> so<00:01:33.299> one<00:01:33.479> of<00:01:33.509> the

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
an attack against an enemy so one of the

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.359 
an attack against an enemy so one of the
reasons<00:01:33.990> why<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.200> dynamics<00:01:34.710> is<00:01:34.950> so<00:01:35.159> deadly

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
reasons why the dynamics is so deadly

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.460 
reasons why the dynamics is so deadly
it's<00:01:35.640> not<00:01:35.820> just<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.210> bonus<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:36.720> 20<00:01:37.170> verses

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
it's not just the bonus of 20 verses

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.890 
it's not just the bonus of 20 verses
infantry<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.100> high<00:01:38.250> damage<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:38.939> AP<00:01:39.180> but<00:01:39.720> also

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
infantry the high damage and AP but also

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.690 
infantry the high damage and AP but also
because<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.409> range<00:01:40.650> allows<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.400> hit

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
because the range allows it to hit

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.960 
because the range allows it to hit
enemies<00:01:42.180> quickly<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.710> get<00:01:43.829> enemies<00:01:44.250> inside<00:01:44.790> of

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
enemies quickly to get enemies inside of

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.270 
enemies quickly to get enemies inside of
the<00:01:45.090> radius<00:01:45.420> before<00:01:45.930> they<00:01:46.350> get<00:01:46.560> inside<00:01:46.799> of<00:01:47.130> the

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
the radius before they get inside of the

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.990 
the radius before they get inside of the
radios<00:01:47.610> themselves<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.899> also<00:01:49.409> in<00:01:49.670> MLA<00:01:50.670> blobs

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
radios themselves and also in MLA blobs

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.600 
radios themselves and also in MLA blobs
to<00:01:51.630> reach<00:01:52.140> more<00:01:52.680> enemies<00:01:53.070> whether<00:01:53.280> attack

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
to reach more enemies whether attack

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.190 
to reach more enemies whether attack
radiuses<00:01:56.149> something<00:01:57.149> that<00:01:57.600> is<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:57.869> bit<00:01:58.170> weird

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
radiuses something that is a bit weird

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.310 
radiuses something that is a bit weird
about<00:01:59.189> this<00:01:59.460> is<00:01:59.729> that<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.570> axe<00:02:00.750> has<00:02:01.020> a<00:02:01.049> range

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
about this is that the axe has a range

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.420 
about this is that the axe has a range
of<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:02.240> the<00:02:03.240> mace<00:02:03.479> used<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.590> be<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.920> only<00:02:05.070> other

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
of to the mace used to be the only other

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.160 
of to the mace used to be the only other
weapon<00:02:05.820> with<00:02:05.939> a<00:02:05.969> range<00:02:06.180> of<00:02:06.299> to<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.960> maze

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
weapon with a range of to the maze

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.350 
weapon with a range of to the maze
wielded<00:02:07.740> by<00:02:07.770> some<00:02:08.099> Persian<00:02:08.459> units<00:02:08.819> and<00:02:09.060> others

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
wielded by some Persian units and others

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.260 
wielded by some Persian units and others
now<00:02:09.959> they<00:02:10.140> have<00:02:10.319> five<00:02:10.649> damage<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:11.580> twenty<00:02:11.910> AP

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
now they have five damage and twenty AP

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.760 
now they have five damage and twenty AP
they<00:02:12.450> used<00:02:12.629> to<00:02:12.720> have<00:02:12.840> two<00:02:13.020> range

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
they used to have two range

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.710 
they used to have two range
so<00:02:14.010> they<00:02:14.190> got<00:02:14.340> buffed<00:02:14.730> unnerved<00:02:15.240> at<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.540> same

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
so they got buffed unnerved at the same

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.850 
so they got buffed unnerved at the same

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
especially mella cavalry however the

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.570 
especially mella cavalry however the
lawns<00:03:22.860> in<00:03:23.270> my<00:03:24.270> opinion<00:03:24.570> should<00:03:25.440> also<00:03:25.920> get

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
lawns in my opinion should also get

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.260 
lawns in my opinion should also get
increased<00:03:27.650> an<00:03:28.650> increase<00:03:29.310> in<00:03:29.550> attack<00:03:29.940> radius

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270 
increased an increase in attack radius

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.199 
increased an increase in attack radius
on<00:03:30.450> the<00:03:30.720> charge<00:03:31.080> now<00:03:31.800> I<00:03:31.830> realize<00:03:32.520> that<00:03:32.880> it's

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
on the charge now I realize that it's

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.620 
on the charge now I realize that it's
not<00:03:33.770> feasible<00:03:34.770> to<00:03:35.070> have<00:03:35.280> a<00:03:35.730> unit<00:03:36.240> having<00:03:36.420> two

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
not feasible to have a unit having two

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.330 
not feasible to have a unit having two
weapons<00:03:36.990> so<00:03:37.140> that<00:03:37.170> they<00:03:37.890> would<00:03:38.070> have<00:03:38.190> the

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
weapons so that they would have the

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.370 
weapons so that they would have the
Lance<00:03:38.580> to<00:03:39.180> to<00:03:39.600> attack<00:03:39.840> Raiders<00:03:40.140> from<00:03:40.230> the

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
Lance to to attack Raiders from the

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.770 
Lance to to attack Raiders from the
charge<00:03:40.620> and<00:03:40.860> then<00:03:41.100> the<00:03:42.090> attack<00:03:42.270> radius<00:03:42.630> would

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
charge and then the attack radius would

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.270 
charge and then the attack radius would
drop<00:03:43.020> so<00:03:43.350> I<00:03:43.770> get<00:03:44.130> that<00:03:44.280> but<00:03:45.380> it<00:03:46.380> would<00:03:46.890> be<00:03:47.040> very

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
drop so I get that but it would be very

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.100 
drop so I get that but it would be very
nice<00:03:47.610> to<00:03:47.940> see<00:03:48.840> a<00:03:49.580> range<00:03:50.580> becoming<00:03:51.420> a<00:03:51.510> factor<00:03:51.720> as

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
nice to see a range becoming a factor as

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.610 
nice to see a range becoming a factor as
well<00:03:52.140> as<00:03:52.560> just<00:03:53.459> pure<00:03:53.880> damage<00:03:54.300> in<00:03:55.170> terms<00:03:55.470> of

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
well as just pure damage in terms of

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.770 
well as just pure damage in terms of
stats<00:03:55.890> for<00:03:56.190> different<00:03:56.670> different<00:03:57.480> weapons<00:03:59.780> so

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
stats for different different weapons so

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.390 
stats for different different weapons so
the<00:04:00.930> spares<00:04:01.200> would<00:04:01.440> be<00:04:01.560> more<00:04:01.770> viable<00:04:02.040> because

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
the spares would be more viable because

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.570 
the spares would be more viable because
they<00:04:02.700> would<00:04:02.850> allow<00:04:03.200> they<00:04:04.200> would<00:04:04.380> allow<00:04:04.680> more

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
they would allow they would allow more

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.510 
they would allow they would allow more
enemies<00:04:06.120> to<00:04:06.420> attack<00:04:06.780> at<00:04:06.930> once<00:04:07.050> and<00:04:07.950> they<00:04:08.370> would

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:08.520 
enemies to attack at once and they would

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.860 
enemies to attack at once and they would
allow<00:04:08.700> more<00:04:08.910> friendlies<00:04:09.330> to<00:04:09.510> attack<00:04:09.690> at<00:04:09.810> once

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
allow more friendlies to attack at once

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.840 
allow more friendlies to attack at once
they<00:04:10.440> would<00:04:10.650> work<00:04:10.800> better<00:04:11.100> against<00:04:11.610> cavalry

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
they would work better against cavalry

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.790 
they would work better against cavalry
an<00:04:12.000> expert<00:04:12.300> George<00:04:12.540> they<00:04:13.050> could<00:04:13.350> work<00:04:13.560> better

an expert George they could work better

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.380 
video weapon ranges why on earth the day
max<00:04:37.650> is<00:04:37.830> the<00:04:37.950> only<00:04:38.100> weapon<00:04:38.370> with<00:04:38.790> a<00:04:38.820> 2<00:04:39.120> range

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.560 
max is the only weapon with a 2 range
when<00:04:40.200> the<00:04:40.950> lawn<00:04:41.130> stirs<00:04:41.520> and<00:04:41.760> the<00:04:42.270> spares

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
when the lawn stirs and the spares

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.990 
when the lawn stirs and the spares
basically<00:04:43.170> screamed<00:04:43.500> for<00:04:43.710> having<00:04:44.010> to<00:04:44.730> range

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
basically screamed for having to range

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.120 
basically screamed for having to range
as<00:04:45.150> well<00:04:45.300> because<00:04:45.930> if<00:04:46.110> the<00:04:46.320> Lancers<00:04:46.710> had<00:04:46.920> to

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
as well because if the Lancers had to

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.370 
as well because if the Lancers had to
range<00:04:47.400> that<00:04:48.120> would<00:04:48.390> in<00:04:48.540> essence<00:04:48.870> allow<00:04:49.170> them

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
range that would in essence allow them

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.830 
range that would in essence allow them
to<00:04:49.560> impale<00:04:49.950> incoming<00:04:50.670> enemy<00:04:50.940> cavalry<00:04:51.120> before

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
to impale incoming enemy cavalry before

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.480 
to impale incoming enemy cavalry before
they<00:04:52.080> had<00:04:52.230> a<00:04:52.260> chance<00:04:52.380> to<00:04:52.830> hit<00:04:52.950> the<00:04:53.130> Lancers

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
they had a chance to hit the Lancers

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.900 
they had a chance to hit the Lancers
whereas<00:04:54.270> now<00:04:54.540> it's<00:04:54.980> basically<00:04:55.980> the<00:04:56.070> Lancers

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
whereas now it's basically the Lancers

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.600 
whereas now it's basically the Lancers
take<00:04:57.150> damage<00:04:57.420> from<00:04:57.860> from<00:04:58.860> units<00:04:59.220> with<00:04:59.400> much

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
take damage from from units with much

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.990 
take damage from from units with much
shorter<00:05:00.240> weapons<00:05:00.600> than<00:05:00.870> they<00:05:01.050> have<00:05:01.820> but<00:05:02.820> we

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
shorter weapons than they have but we

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.430 
shorter weapons than they have but we
can<00:05:03.150> take<00:05:03.270> a<00:05:03.300> look<00:05:03.360> at<00:05:03.600> some<00:05:03.780> other<00:05:03.840> things<00:05:04.290> as

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440

then we have gate damage and this is a

single<00:06:18.270> player<00:06:18.480> type<00:06:18.780> of<00:06:18.930> thing<00:06:19.790> but<00:06:20.790> yeah<00:06:21.000> the

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 
single player type of thing but yeah the

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.860 
single player type of thing but yeah the
the<00:06:21.270> the<00:06:22.260> folks<00:06:22.710> the<00:06:23.160> horse<00:06:23.370> shoer<00:06:23.700> the<00:06:24.150> axe

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:24.870 
the the folks the horse shoer the axe

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.710 
the the folks the horse shoer the axe
and<00:06:25.500> the<00:06:25.530> Dane<00:06:26.070> acts<00:06:26.310> a<00:06:26.640> lot<00:06:26.910> more<00:06:27.180> effective

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:27.720 
and the Dane acts a lot more effective

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:32.770 
and the Dane acts a lot more effective
than<00:06:27.990> the<00:06:28.460> spares<00:06:29.460> launches<00:06:30.420> against<00:06:30.870> gates

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:32.780 
than the spares launches against gates

bit<00:06:33.780> of<00:06:33.900> rumble<00:06:34.320> but<00:06:34.650> main<00:06:34.950> point<00:06:35.310> here<00:06:35.460> though

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:35.820 
bit of rumble but main point here though

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:40.040 
bit of rumble but main point here though
is<00:06:36.030> that<00:06:37.040> weapon<00:06:38.040> length<00:06:38.250> in<00:06:38.610> Attila<00:06:39.360> is<00:06:39.570> an

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:40.050 
is that weapon length in Attila is an

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:41.360 
is that weapon length in Attila is an
absolute<00:06:40.650> mess

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:41.370 
absolute mess

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:44.480 
absolute mess
it<00:06:41.580> makes<00:06:41.910> a<00:06:42.210> mass<00:06:42.479> of<00:06:42.690> a<00:06:43.199> specialist<00:06:44.160> Pierce

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:44.490 
it makes a mass of a specialist Pierce

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:47.870 
it makes a mass of a specialist Pierce
but<00:06:45.360> also<00:06:45.720> in<00:06:46.260> my<00:06:46.410> opinion<00:06:46.740> shock<00:06:47.220> cavalry<00:06:47.669> on

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:47.880 
but also in my opinion shock cavalry on

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:51.950 
but also in my opinion shock cavalry on
on<00:06:48.360> the<00:06:48.870> church<00:06:49.580> having<00:06:50.580> longer<00:06:51.180> range<00:06:51.419> would

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:51.960 
on the church having longer range would

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.530 
on the church having longer range would
potentially<00:06:52.410> make<00:06:52.949> lighter<00:06:53.940> shall<00:06:54.360> cover

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:54.540 
potentially make lighter shall cover

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:56.840 
potentially make lighter shall cover
units<00:06:54.990> more<00:06:55.169> viable<00:06:55.410> because<00:06:56.250> it<00:06:56.610> would<00:06:56.820> allow

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:56.850 
units more viable because it would allow

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:00.170 
units more viable because it would allow
them<00:06:57.360> to<00:06:57.710> kill<00:06:58.710> quite<00:06:59.370> a<00:06:59.430> few<00:06:59.550> of<00:06:59.699> the<00:06:59.910> enemy

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:00.180 
them to kill quite a few of the enemy

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:02.420 
them to kill quite a few of the enemy
cavalry<00:07:00.330> before<00:07:01.260> they<00:07:01.680> get<00:07:01.830> hit<00:07:02.010> by<00:07:02.370> the

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:02.430 
cavalry before they get hit by the

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:05.150 
cavalry before they get hit by the
impact<00:07:03.030> of<00:07:03.270> that<00:07:03.360> cavalry<00:07:04.110> themselves<00:07:04.979> if

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:05.160 
impact of that cavalry themselves if

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.310 
impact of that cavalry themselves if
they<00:07:05.669> had<00:07:05.820> a<00:07:05.850> range<00:07:06.150> of<00:07:06.360> let's<00:07:06.630> say<00:07:06.810> a<00:07:07.020> ratio

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:07.320 
they had a range of let's say a ratio

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:09.650 
they had a range of let's say a ratio
three<00:07:07.620> or<00:07:07.979> two<00:07:08.160> and<00:07:08.280> a<00:07:08.340> half<00:07:08.490> for<00:07:08.820> I'm<00:07:09.510> not

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:09.660 
three or two and a half for I'm not

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:11.030 
three or two and a half for I'm not
really<00:07:09.870> sure<00:07:09.960> but<00:07:10.320> it<00:07:10.500> would<00:07:10.680> be<00:07:10.710> something

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:11.040 
really sure but it would be something

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.840 
really sure but it would be something
that<00:07:11.220> would<00:07:11.340> be<00:07:11.550> very<00:07:11.699> interesting<00:07:12.300> to<00:07:12.330> to<00:07:13.169> see

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:13.850 
that would be very interesting to to see

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:16.279 
that would be very interesting to to see
so<00:07:14.850> that's<00:07:14.970> it<00:07:15.210> probably<00:07:15.720> the<00:07:15.900> most<00:07:16.080> boring

00:07:16.279 --> 00:07:16.289 
so that's it probably the most boring

00:07:16.289 --> 00:07:19.310 
so that's it probably the most boring
video<00:07:16.919> I'll<00:07:17.310> ever<00:07:17.639> make<00:07:17.910> but<00:07:18.660> something<00:07:19.110> that

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:19.320 
video I'll ever make but something that

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:23.050 
video I'll ever make but something that
I<00:07:19.350> think<00:07:20.250> needed<00:07:21.150> to<00:07:21.600> be<00:07:21.840> mentioned

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:23.060 
I think needed to be mentioned

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:26.240 
I think needed to be mentioned
strengthened<00:07:24.060> longer
