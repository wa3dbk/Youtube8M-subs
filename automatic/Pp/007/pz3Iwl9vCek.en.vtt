first<00:01:03.500> I<00:01:03.680> choose<00:01:03.890> a<00:01:03.949> color<00:01:04.250> scheme<00:01:04.580> and<00:01:04.790> they

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
first I choose a color scheme and they

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:06.700 
first I choose a color scheme and they
use<00:01:05.150> washi<00:01:05.420> tape<00:01:05.780> in<00:01:05.930> those<00:01:06.049> colors<00:01:06.380> to

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
use washi tape in those colors to

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.890 
use washi tape in those colors to
separate<00:01:07.100> the<00:01:07.250> DS<00:01:07.460> the<00:01:07.790> washi<00:01:08.329> tape<00:01:08.630> looks

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
separate the DS the washi tape looks

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.230 
separate the DS the washi tape looks
like<00:01:09.140> cubanos<00:01:09.770> does<00:01:10.220> separate<00:01:10.670> everything

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
like cubanos does separate everything

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.969 
like cubanos does separate everything
and<00:01:11.390> keep<00:01:11.540> it<00:01:11.689> really<00:01:11.930> clean<00:01:12.320> looking<00:01:12.710> so<00:01:12.950> I

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
and keep it really clean looking so I

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:13.510 
and keep it really clean looking so I
love<00:01:13.250> that

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
love that

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.969 
love that
next<00:01:14.450> I<00:01:14.540> used<00:01:14.750> to<00:01:14.960> cuss<00:01:15.140> on<00:01:15.170> these<00:01:15.560> are<00:01:15.770> ones

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
next I used to cuss on these are ones

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:17.800 
next I used to cuss on these are ones
that<00:01:16.130> I<00:01:16.250> meet<00:01:16.520> in<00:01:16.549> another<00:01:16.790> plan<00:01:17.360> of<00:01:17.509> video

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
that I meet in another plan of video

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.780 
that I meet in another plan of video
I'll<00:01:18.470> link<00:01:18.650> it<00:01:18.829> in<00:01:18.920> on<00:01:19.070> the<00:01:19.189> screen<00:01:19.340> for<00:01:19.579> you<00:01:19.700> to

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
I'll link it in on the screen for you to

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.710 
I'll link it in on the screen for you to
check<00:01:19.970> out

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.390 

I<00:01:24.810> put<00:01:25.810> one<00:01:26.020> sticker<00:01:26.440> on<00:01:26.590> alternating<00:01:27.130> sides

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
I put one sticker on alternating sides

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.520 
I put one sticker on alternating sides
of<00:01:27.850> the<00:01:27.970> pedes<00:01:28.300> so<00:01:28.480> Monday<00:01:28.900> is<00:01:29.050> on<00:01:29.200> the<00:01:29.320> Left

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
of the pedes so Monday is on the Left

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.590 
of the pedes so Monday is on the Left
Tuesday<00:01:30.190> on<00:01:30.310> the<00:01:30.340> right<00:01:30.640> and<00:01:30.880> then<00:01:31.090> Wednesdays

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
Tuesday on the right and then Wednesdays

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.000 
Tuesday on the right and then Wednesdays
on<00:01:31.750> the<00:01:31.870> left<00:01:32.080> again<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:34.360> think<00:01:35.260> it<00:01:35.500> looks<00:01:35.740> more

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.010 
on the left again I think it looks more

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.130 
on the left again I think it looks more
geometrically<00:01:36.700> pleasing<00:01:37.360> and<00:01:37.720> I<00:01:37.810> know<00:01:37.870> it's

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
geometrically pleasing and I know it's

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.420 
geometrically pleasing and I know it's
weird<00:01:38.320> but<00:01:38.470> that's<00:01:38.680> just<00:01:38.920> me<00:01:40.140> I<00:01:41.140> make<00:01:41.950> cute

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
weird but that's just me I make cute

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.340 
weird but that's just me I make cute
bullet<00:01:42.850> points<00:01:43.240> like<00:01:43.390> hearts<00:01:43.750> and<00:01:43.900> circles

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
bullet points like hearts and circles

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.830 
bullet points like hearts and circles
using<00:01:44.740> a<00:01:44.860> colored<00:01:45.250> ink<00:01:45.520> pen<00:01:45.760> it's<00:01:46.510> a<00:01:46.690> lot

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
using a colored ink pen it's a lot

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.830 
using a colored ink pen it's a lot
cheaper<00:01:47.110> than<00:01:47.290> using<00:01:47.740> stickers<00:01:48.040> and<00:01:48.400> we<00:01:48.580> more

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
cheaper than using stickers and we more

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.550 
cheaper than using stickers and we more
personalizable<00:01:49.840> if<00:01:49.960> that's<00:01:50.140> even<00:01:50.320> a<00:01:50.530> word

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
personalizable if that's even a word

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.920 
personalizable if that's even a word
since<00:01:51.400> you<00:01:51.550> can<00:01:51.700> use<00:01:51.730> any<00:01:52.060> color<00:01:52.330> that<00:01:52.450> suits

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930
