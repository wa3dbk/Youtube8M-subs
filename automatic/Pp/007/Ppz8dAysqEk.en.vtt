00:01:58.269 --> 00:01:58.279 
any damage I'll have to figure out a way

00:01:58.279 --> 00:02:00.580 
any damage I'll have to figure out a way
to<00:01:58.340> put<00:01:58.520> them<00:01:58.670> back<00:01:58.789> on<00:01:58.849> or<00:01:59.749> possibly<00:02:00.380> get

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
to put them back on or possibly get

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.289 
to put them back on or possibly get
repros<00:02:01.039> but<00:02:01.249> since<00:02:01.429> I<00:02:01.520> had<00:02:01.759> all<00:02:02.029> of<00:02:02.179> the

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
repros but since I had all of the

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:04.389 
repros but since I had all of the
stickers<00:02:02.539> I<00:02:02.779> certainly<00:02:03.229> don't<00:02:03.439> want<00:02:03.649> to<00:02:03.740> throw

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
stickers I certainly don't want to throw

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:06.069 
stickers I certainly don't want to throw
them<00:02:04.549> away<00:02:04.639> or<00:02:04.789> not<00:02:04.939> use<00:02:05.270> them<00:02:05.479> if<00:02:05.599> I<00:02:05.719> can<00:02:05.929> get

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 
them away or not use them if I can get

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:07.209 
them away or not use them if I can get
away<00:02:06.170> with<00:02:06.380> using<00:02:06.529> them<00:02:06.770> again

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:07.219 
away with using them again

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:09.249 
away with using them again

the<00:02:21.170> only<00:02:21.349> piece<00:02:21.739> I<00:02:21.950> don't<00:02:22.010> have

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
the only piece I don't have

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.800 
the only piece I don't have
is<00:02:23.060> the<00:02:23.930> infamous<00:02:24.640> Jedi<00:02:25.640> training<00:02:26.030> remote<00:02:26.570> and

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
is the infamous Jedi training remote and

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.770 
is the infamous Jedi training remote and
the<00:02:27.470> reason<00:02:27.800> I<00:02:27.860> don't<00:02:27.920> have<00:02:28.130> it<00:02:28.460> sadly<00:02:29.450> is

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
the reason I don't have it sadly is

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.410 
the reason I don't have it sadly is
because<00:02:30.530> I<00:02:30.860> didn't<00:02:31.100> like<00:02:31.250> it<00:02:31.460> as<00:02:31.610> a<00:02:31.880> kid<00:02:32.240> I

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
because I didn't like it as a kid I

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.360 
because I didn't like it as a kid I
thought<00:02:32.840> it<00:02:33.110> was<00:02:33.230> stupid<00:02:33.470> and<00:02:33.830> I<00:02:33.980> didn't<00:02:34.220> want

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
thought it was stupid and I didn't want

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.430 
thought it was stupid and I didn't want
to<00:02:34.430> use<00:02:34.580> it<00:02:34.610> so<00:02:35.540> I<00:02:35.600> left<00:02:35.900> it<00:02:36.020> off

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
to use it so I left it off

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:43.140 
to use it so I left it off
I<00:02:36.730> still<00:02:37.730> have<00:02:38.350> come<00:02:39.350> on<00:02:39.560> you<00:02:40.780> still<00:02:41.780> have<00:02:42.230> the

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
there it is I still have the arm that

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.150 
there it is I still have the arm that
the<00:02:49.400> training<00:02:49.730> ball<00:02:50.440> would<00:02:51.440> hang<00:02:51.620> from<00:02:51.890> I

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
the training ball would hang from I

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.580 
the training ball would hang from I
liked<00:02:52.850> that<00:02:52.970> part<00:02:53.330> but<00:02:53.959> I<00:02:53.990> didn't<00:02:54.230> like<00:02:54.410> the

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
liked that part but I didn't like the

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.560 
liked that part but I didn't like the
other<00:02:54.709> part<00:02:55.040> and<00:02:55.250> I<00:02:55.310> thought<00:02:55.940> it<00:02:56.090> didn't

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
other part and I thought it didn't

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.420 
other part and I thought it didn't
belong<00:02:56.780> to<00:02:56.959> Han<00:02:57.110> Solo<00:02:57.440> so<00:02:57.770> I<00:02:57.800> didn't<00:02:58.010> put<00:02:58.130> it<00:02:58.250> I

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
belong to Han Solo so I didn't put it I

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:59.830 
belong to Han Solo so I didn't put it I
didn't<00:02:58.760> put<00:02:58.970> that<00:02:59.030> little<00:02:59.360> ball<00:02:59.510> in<00:02:59.690> there<00:02:59.810> I

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
didn't put that little ball in there I

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.500 
didn't put that little ball in there I
felt<00:03:00.050> like<00:03:00.170> that<00:03:00.260> was<00:03:00.380> something<00:03:00.410> obi-wan

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
felt like that was something obi-wan

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.090 
felt like that was something obi-wan
brought<00:03:02.510> with<00:03:02.720> him<00:03:02.870> so<00:03:03.350> I<00:03:03.650> felt<00:03:03.890> like<00:03:04.040> it

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
brought with him so I felt like it

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.100 
brought with him so I felt like it
wasn't<00:03:04.489> part<00:03:04.910> of<00:03:05.030> the<00:03:05.150> Millennium<00:03:05.510> Falcon<00:03:05.959> and

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
wasn't part of the Millennium Falcon and

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.630 
wasn't part of the Millennium Falcon and
I<00:03:06.440> just<00:03:06.650> didn't<00:03:06.830> like<00:03:06.980> this<00:03:07.220> fishing<00:03:07.610> line

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
I just didn't like this fishing line

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.190 
I just didn't like this fishing line
thing<00:03:08.150> hanging<00:03:08.420> there<00:03:08.630> so<00:03:08.780> I'm<00:03:08.870> going<00:03:08.989> to<00:03:09.080> have

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
thing hanging there so I'm going to have

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.050 
thing hanging there so I'm going to have
to<00:03:09.350> get<00:03:09.709> one<00:03:09.920> of<00:03:10.010> those<00:03:10.160> to<00:03:10.459> replace<00:03:10.790> it<00:03:10.940> with

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
to get one of those to replace it with

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.600 
to get one of those to replace it with
which<00:03:11.209> is<00:03:11.360> a<00:03:11.570> bummer<00:03:12.200> since<00:03:12.530> that's<00:03:12.800> the<00:03:13.459> most

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
which is a bummer since that's the most

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.840 
which is a bummer since that's the most
valuable<00:03:14.320> loose<00:03:15.320> piece<00:03:15.680> of<00:03:16.010> the<00:03:16.520> Millennium

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
I had it rolling around in my action

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.270 
I had it rolling around in my action

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
figure bin for a long time and then I

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.580 
figure bin for a long time and then I
think<00:03:22.550> I<00:03:22.610> finally<00:03:22.880> lost<00:03:23.300> track<00:03:23.660> of<00:03:23.690> it<00:03:23.900> as<00:03:24.530> a

come from because I think it's dead and
I<00:03:54.799> think<00:03:55.070> I<00:03:55.160> might<00:03:55.459> have<00:03:55.519> killed<00:03:55.910> it<00:03:56.060> back<00:03:56.540> when

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
I was a kid so that might have to be

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.180 
I was a kid so that might have to be
replaced<00:03:58.700> but<00:03:58.910> those<00:03:59.090> can<00:03:59.239> be<00:03:59.269> found<00:03:59.540> and
