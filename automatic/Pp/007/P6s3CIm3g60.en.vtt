13 fishing concept a as you can see it's
a<00:00:12.389> good-looking<00:00:12.719> reel<00:00:13.190> you<00:00:14.190> know<00:00:14.309> that's<00:00:14.490> one

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
a good-looking reel you know that's one

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:15.860 
a good-looking reel you know that's one
of<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.790> coolest<00:00:15.059> things<00:00:15.269> about<00:00:15.389> it<00:00:15.719> it<00:00:15.839> just

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
of the coolest things about it it just

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.060 
of the coolest things about it it just
looks<00:00:16.350> awesome

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
looks awesome

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.170 
looks awesome
with<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:18.090> cork<00:00:18.359> knobs<00:00:18.570> and<00:00:18.900> everything<00:00:18.990> and

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:20.180 
with the cork knobs and everything and

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.689 
with the cork knobs and everything and
it's<00:00:21.180> just<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.449> good-looking<00:00:21.660> reel<00:00:22.199> but<00:00:22.500> uh<00:00:22.699> as

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
it's just a good-looking reel but uh as

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.300 
it's just a good-looking reel but uh as
far<00:00:24.029> as<00:00:24.150> performance<00:00:24.330> goes<00:00:24.810> I<00:00:25.289> think<00:00:26.070> this

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
far as performance goes I think this

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.599 
far as performance goes I think this
reel<00:00:26.580> is<00:00:26.820> you<00:00:27.689> know<00:00:27.810> unmatched<00:00:28.410> anywhere<00:00:28.949> near

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
reel is you know unmatched anywhere near

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.150 
reel is you know unmatched anywhere near
its<00:00:29.880> price<00:00:30.210> point<00:00:30.660> it<00:00:31.140> retails<00:00:31.619> for<00:00:31.710> 170<00:00:33.950> but<00:00:34.950> I

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
its price point it retails for 170 but I

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.240 
its price point it retails for 170 but I
think<00:00:35.520> it<00:00:35.670> performs<00:00:36.180> way<00:00:36.510> better<00:00:36.989> than<00:00:37.260> most

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
think it performs way better than most

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.280 
think it performs way better than most
reels<00:00:38.700> around<00:00:39.120> that<00:00:39.329> range<00:00:39.540> even<00:00:39.840> around<00:00:40.140> the

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
reels around that range even around the

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.020 
reels around that range even around the
$200<00:00:40.950> range<00:00:41.570> but<00:00:42.570> um<00:00:43.190> my<00:00:44.190> favorite<00:00:44.460> part<00:00:44.940> about

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
$200 range but um my favorite part about

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.580 
$200 range but um my favorite part about
it<00:00:45.390> probably<00:00:45.690> is<00:00:46.250> the<00:00:47.250> drag<00:00:47.579> it's<00:00:48.450> got<00:00:48.780> 22

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
it probably is the drag it's got 22

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.029 
it probably is the drag it's got 22
pounds<00:00:50.129> of<00:00:50.250> drag<00:00:50.489> which<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.600> unheard<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.800> for

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
pounds of drag which is unheard of for

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.119 
pounds of drag which is unheard of for
low-profile<00:00:53.850> bait<00:00:54.059> casters<00:00:54.770> that's<00:00:55.770> just<00:00:56.010> a

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
low-profile bait casters that's just a

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.610 
low-profile bait casters that's just a
lot<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.340> drag<00:00:56.699> if<00:00:56.940> you're<00:00:57.149> like<00:00:57.449> flipping<00:00:58.440> and

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
lot of drag if you're like flipping and

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.500 
lot of drag if you're like flipping and
pitching<00:00:58.649> or<00:00:59.190> using<00:00:59.609> an<00:00:59.699> application<00:00:59.879> that

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
pitching or using an application that

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.869

all I mean you can lock this thing down

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.130 
all I mean you can lock this thing down
and<00:01:07.650> it's<00:01:08.549> not<00:01:08.670> going<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.030> slip<00:01:09.299> it's<00:01:09.659> it's

awesome and uh it comes in a lot of
different<00:01:13.560> gear<00:01:13.710> ratios<00:01:13.830> I<00:01:14.250> think<00:01:14.430> like<00:01:14.549> four

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
different gear ratios I think like four

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.820 
different gear ratios I think like four
different<00:01:14.939> gear<00:01:15.299> ratios<00:01:15.450> this<00:01:16.409> one<00:01:16.710> right

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
different gear ratios this one right

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.660 
different gear ratios this one right
here<00:01:17.070> is<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.310> high<00:01:17.460> speed<00:01:18.979> eight<00:01:19.979> point<00:01:20.430> one

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
here is the high speed eight point one

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.730 
here is the high speed eight point one
two<00:01:20.909> one<00:01:21.119> so<00:01:21.509> I<00:01:21.540> like<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:21.869> use<00:01:22.170> this<00:01:22.350> one<00:01:22.560> for

you<00:04:09.260> can<00:04:09.410> see<00:04:09.680> there's<00:04:10.100> that<00:04:10.340> dial<00:04:10.640> right

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
you can see there's that dial right

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:15.820 
you can see there's that dial right
there<00:04:12.340> it'll<00:04:13.340> focus<00:04:14.110> but<00:04:15.110> it's<00:04:15.590> got<00:04:15.800> that

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
there it'll focus but it's got that

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:17.590 
there it'll focus but it's got that
little<00:04:16.100> white<00:04:16.430> tick<00:04:16.790> mark<00:04:17.060> right<00:04:17.239> there<00:04:17.269> that

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
little white tick mark right there that

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.300 
little white tick mark right there that
tells<00:04:17.840> you<00:04:17.930> what<00:04:18.080> setting<00:04:18.410> you're<00:04:18.500> on<00:04:18.650> all<00:04:19.130> you

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
tells you what setting you're on all you

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.140 
tells you what setting you're on all you
do<00:04:19.400> is<00:04:19.519> hold<00:04:19.729> the<00:04:19.940> spool

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
do is hold the spool

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.870 
do is hold the spool
and<00:04:21.449> you<00:04:21.570> can<00:04:21.720> turn<00:04:21.959> the<00:04:22.139> dial<00:04:22.730> to<00:04:23.730> whatever

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
and you can turn the dial to whatever

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.430 
and you can turn the dial to whatever
you<00:04:24.180> want<00:04:24.330> it<00:04:24.419> on<00:04:24.540> I<00:04:24.720> like<00:04:24.870> to<00:04:25.020> keep<00:04:25.199> mine<00:04:25.410> on

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
you want it on I like to keep mine on

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.020 
you want it on I like to keep mine on
like<00:04:25.800> two<00:04:26.669> or<00:04:26.850> three<00:04:26.880> and<00:04:28.010> I<00:04:29.010> know<00:04:29.190> it's<00:04:29.699> you

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
like two or three and I know it's you

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.430 
like two or three and I know it's you
have<00:04:30.120> to<00:04:30.240> take<00:04:30.389> the<00:04:30.540> side<00:04:30.750> plate<00:04:30.990> off<00:04:31.139> to<00:04:31.320> get

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
have to take the side plate off to get

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.620 
have to take the side plate off to get
to<00:04:31.500> it<00:04:31.800> but<00:04:32.460> really<00:04:32.669> I<00:04:32.820> don't<00:04:32.940> think<00:04:33.120> it's<00:04:33.389> a

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
to it but really I don't think it's a

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.570 
to it but really I don't think it's a
big<00:04:33.930> deal<00:04:34.139> or<00:04:34.320> an<00:04:34.410> issue<00:04:34.560> at<00:04:34.830> all<00:04:34.949> because<00:04:35.190> I

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
big deal or an issue at all because I

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.689 
big deal or an issue at all because I
set<00:04:36.240> mine<00:04:36.449> on<00:04:36.660> two<00:04:36.900> or<00:04:37.050> three<00:04:37.290> and<00:04:37.800> I<00:04:38.460> just

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 
set mine on two or three and I just

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:41.540 
set mine on two or three and I just
leave<00:04:38.880> it<00:04:38.940> there<00:04:39.240> and<00:04:39.510> from<00:04:40.229> there<00:04:40.470> if<00:04:41.100> I<00:04:41.340> need

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
leave it there and from there if I need

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.100 
leave it there and from there if I need
to<00:04:41.639> make<00:04:41.790> any<00:04:41.880> adjustments<00:04:42.060> I<00:04:42.540> use<00:04:42.720> the<00:04:42.870> spool

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
to make any adjustments I use the spool

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.900 
to make any adjustments I use the spool
tension<00:04:43.500> knob<00:04:43.710> right<00:04:43.889> here<00:04:43.949> but<00:04:44.960> I<00:04:46.699> just<00:04:47.699> set

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
tension knob right here but I just set

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.250 
tension knob right here but I just set
it<00:04:48.000> on<00:04:48.060> two<00:04:48.240> or<00:04:48.389> three<00:04:48.540> and<00:04:48.660> leave<00:04:48.840> it<00:04:48.990> and<00:04:49.110> it's

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
it on two or three and leave it and it's

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.350 
it on two or three and leave it and it's
real<00:04:49.470> easy<00:04:49.500> to<00:04:49.800> cast<00:04:50.100> on<00:04:50.310> never<00:04:50.580> backlash<00:04:51.150> this

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
real easy to cast on never backlash this

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.530 
real easy to cast on never backlash this
reel<00:04:51.660> and<00:04:51.900> uh<00:04:52.370> I've<00:04:53.370> even<00:04:53.729> you<00:04:54.060> know<00:04:54.150> let<00:04:54.419> my

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 
reel and uh I've even you know let my

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.390 
reel and uh I've even you know let my
girlfriend<00:04:54.840> use<00:04:55.229> it<00:04:55.380> and<00:04:55.560> she<00:04:55.740> usually<00:04:56.130> can't

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
girlfriend use it and she usually can't

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.250 
girlfriend use it and she usually can't
cast<00:04:56.639> a<00:04:56.850> baitcaster<00:04:57.030> very<00:04:57.600> well<00:04:58.820> but

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 
cast a baitcaster very well but

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.480 
cast a baitcaster very well but
something<00:05:01.260> about<00:05:01.380> this<00:05:01.650> one<00:05:01.860> she<00:05:02.100> can<00:05:02.280> cast

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
something about this one she can cast

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.230 
something about this one she can cast
this<00:05:02.760> one<00:05:02.940> pretty<00:05:03.180> good<00:05:03.479> so<00:05:03.900> uh<00:05:03.930> I<00:05:04.760> think<00:05:05.760> just

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
this one pretty good so uh I think just

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.360 
this one pretty good so uh I think just
it's<00:05:06.450> got<00:05:06.600> a<00:05:06.660> real<00:05:06.900> nice<00:05:07.080> braking<00:05:07.620> system<00:05:08.100> and

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
it's got a real nice braking system and

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.659 
it's got a real nice braking system and
it's<00:05:08.940> smooth<00:05:09.360> so<00:05:10.400> something<00:05:11.400> about<00:05:11.520> that

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:11.669 
it's smooth so something about that

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:13.520 
it's smooth so something about that
combination<00:05:11.940> makes<00:05:12.539> it<00:05:12.720> real<00:05:12.900> easy<00:05:13.139> to<00:05:13.229> cast

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
combination makes it real easy to cast

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.379 
combination makes it real easy to cast
and<00:05:13.860> really<00:05:14.100> difficult<00:05:14.310> to<00:05:14.669> backlash<00:05:15.120> so

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:15.389 
and really difficult to backlash so

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:17.690 
and really difficult to backlash so
let's<00:05:16.020> take<00:05:16.200> a<00:05:16.229> look<00:05:16.440> at<00:05:16.590> the<00:05:16.710> box<00:05:16.919> real<00:05:17.160> quick

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 
let's take a look at the box real quick

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.670 
let's take a look at the box real quick
so<00:05:18.300> we<00:05:18.690> can<00:05:18.870> look<00:05:19.020> at<00:05:19.169> some<00:05:19.440> of<00:05:19.470> the<00:05:19.590> other

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
so we can look at some of the other

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.230 
so we can look at some of the other
features<00:05:19.979> I<00:05:20.280> probably<00:05:20.580> left<00:05:20.850> out<00:05:23.060> here's<00:05:24.060> the

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
features I probably left out here's the

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.790 
features I probably left out here's the
box<00:05:24.510> um<00:05:25.110> it's<00:05:26.100> got<00:05:26.280> seven<00:05:26.700> bearings<00:05:27.180> oh<00:05:27.800> the

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
box um it's got seven bearings oh the

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.710 
box um it's got seven bearings oh the
dead<00:05:29.039> stop<00:05:29.340> anti<00:05:29.820> reverse<00:05:31.880> really<00:05:32.880> like<00:05:33.120> the

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
dead stop anti reverse really like the

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.500 
dead stop anti reverse really like the
reel<00:05:33.930> has<00:05:34.169> no<00:05:34.440> play<00:05:34.710> in<00:05:34.889> it<00:05:35.039> so<00:05:35.310> as<00:05:36.060> soon<00:05:36.270> as<00:05:36.389> you

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510 
reel has no play in it so as soon as you

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.089 
reel has no play in it so as soon as you
want<00:05:36.660> to<00:05:36.720> set<00:05:36.930> the<00:05:37.080> hook<00:05:37.229> you're<00:05:37.650> setting<00:05:38.010> the

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:38.099 
want to set the hook you're setting the

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:40.640 
want to set the hook you're setting the
hook<00:05:38.190> you're<00:05:38.520> not<00:05:38.669> you<00:05:39.419> know<00:05:39.570> the<00:05:39.840> spool<00:05:40.200> isn't

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
hook you're not you know the spool isn't

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.640 
hook you're not you know the spool isn't
backing<00:05:41.580> up<00:05:41.940> at<00:05:42.270> all<00:05:42.450> it's<00:05:42.960> it's<00:05:43.349> rock-solid

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.650 
backing up at all it's it's rock-solid

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:47.629 
backing up at all it's it's rock-solid
anti<00:05:44.340> reverse<00:05:44.840> I<00:05:45.889> talked<00:05:46.889> about<00:05:47.130> the<00:05:47.280> 22

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:47.639 
anti reverse I talked about the 22

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:50.690 
anti reverse I talked about the 22
pounds<00:05:48.000> of<00:05:48.090> drag<00:05:48.330> the<00:05:49.139> braking<00:05:49.530> system<00:05:50.010> and

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:50.700 
pounds of drag the braking system and

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.779 
pounds of drag the braking system and
it's<00:05:51.660> fresh<00:05:51.930> or<00:05:52.110> saltwater<00:05:52.349> strong<00:05:52.860> and<00:05:53.160> then

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:53.789 
it's fresh or saltwater strong and then

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:56.150 
it's fresh or saltwater strong and then
a<00:05:53.820> one<00:05:54.180> cool<00:05:54.450> thing<00:05:54.479> also<00:05:54.930> is<00:05:55.289> it<00:05:55.470> only<00:05:55.860> weighs

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:56.160 
a one cool thing also is it only weighs

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.860 
a one cool thing also is it only weighs
six<00:05:56.460> point<00:05:56.669> seven<00:05:56.820> ounces<00:05:57.330> so<00:05:57.539> it's<00:05:57.660> really

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:57.870 
six point seven ounces so it's really

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.770 
six point seven ounces so it's really
light<00:05:58.200> and<00:05:59.030> see<00:06:00.030> this<00:06:00.210> one<00:06:00.389> is<00:06:00.510> the<00:06:00.660> eight

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:00.780 
light and see this one is the eight

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.560 
light and see this one is the eight
point<00:06:01.080> one<00:06:01.139> gear<00:06:01.530> ratio<00:06:01.919> which<00:06:02.910> is<00:06:03.030> also<00:06:03.240> not

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:03.570 
point one gear ratio which is also not

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:08.270 
point one gear ratio which is also not
super<00:06:04.020> fast<00:06:04.289> so<00:06:06.169> overall<00:06:07.169> it's<00:06:07.770> just<00:06:07.889> a<00:06:08.250> great
