the<00:01:20.400> wattage<00:01:20.759> would<00:01:21.000> be<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.150> little<00:01:21.299> bit

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
the wattage would be a little bit

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.320 
the wattage would be a little bit
moisture<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.650> then<00:01:23.159> I<00:01:23.280> put<00:01:23.520> this<00:01:23.670> around<00:01:23.939> my
