00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.799
 hello we all live here of the girl 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.480
 situations I bring this tutorial of how 

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:08.700
 create a special folder for 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.950
 applications good in yes no we are not going to 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.160
 create but that the expense that the 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.470
 moment of then this one started a 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.960
 program all your applications are going to 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.600
 a folder where here to a single folder 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.310
 where you are all put there then 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.189
 what we are going to do to appear 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.859
 that folder and have it for example to the 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.929
 hand there because you can see there thou 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.870
 applications that you have installed if 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.620
 you talk about looking for one more example 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.480
 Quick 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.270
 for what they do 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.420
 here we can see the applications 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.550
 true but also because we can already 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.120
 see them we can have on the desk in 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.629
 a folder then later with this 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:55.470
 command what we do not rules is 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:57.930
 enter to execute and we put it and we are 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:01.140
 opens what the folder then then 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.579
 you know all this all the 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.879
 applications that have installed 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.879
 true 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:11.930
 this and with this other command we give it is 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.119
 to create direct access to 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.799
 our application folder so that 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.420
 to have it on the desk then 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:20.119
 what we do, we just stick what we 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.890
 the route the location then nothing else 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.320
