okay<00:00:00.870> the<00:00:00.989> first<00:00:01.140> step<00:00:01.469> is<00:00:01.680> to<00:00:01.920> figure<00:00:02.580> out

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
okay the first step is to figure out

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:03.590 
okay the first step is to figure out
where<00:00:02.850> you're<00:00:02.939> going<00:00:02.970> to<00:00:03.120> mount<00:00:03.240> the<00:00:03.419> brake

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
where you're going to mount the brake

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.320 
where you're going to mount the brake
controller<00:00:03.659> usually<00:00:04.440> typically<00:00:05.220> it's<00:00:05.819> on<00:00:06.029> the

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
controller usually typically it's on the

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.530 
controller usually typically it's on the
right<00:00:07.290> hand<00:00:07.529> side<00:00:07.799> on<00:00:08.309> on<00:00:09.090> the<00:00:09.269> driver<00:00:09.450> side

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
right hand side on on the driver side

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.690 
right hand side on on the driver side
right<00:00:09.929> about<00:00:10.170> in<00:00:10.320> here<00:00:10.349> and<00:00:10.920> we'll<00:00:11.400> go<00:00:11.519> ahead

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
right about in here and we'll go ahead

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.810 
right about in here and we'll go ahead
mark<00:00:12.150> it<00:00:12.330> and<00:00:12.570> then<00:00:13.200> put<00:00:13.860> it<00:00:13.950> up<00:00:14.009> there<00:00:14.190> market

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
mark it and then put it up there market

00:00:14.820 --> 00:01:03.410 
mark it and then put it up there market
and<00:00:15.089> drill<00:00:15.960> out<00:00:16.139> about<00:00:16.500> it

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.610 

and<00:01:04.420> next<00:01:04.659> we'll<00:01:04.750> do<00:01:04.900> is<00:01:05.050> we'll<00:01:05.199> mount<00:01:05.379> the

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:05.620 
and next we'll do is we'll mount the

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.320 
and next we'll do is we'll mount the
brake<00:01:05.800> controller<00:01:06.190> into<00:01:06.520> the<00:01:06.640> bracket<00:01:07.090> and

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
brake controller into the bracket and

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.510 
brake controller into the bracket and
then<00:01:07.869> locate<00:01:08.680> where<00:01:08.860> we're<00:01:09.040> going<00:01:09.220> to<00:01:09.280> run<00:01:09.310> our

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
then locate where we're going to run our

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:16.140 
then locate where we're going to run our
wires<00:01:09.850> underneath<00:01:14.460> now<00:01:15.460> we're<00:01:15.700> going<00:01:15.820> to<00:01:15.880> open

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.150 
wires underneath now we're going to open

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.660 
wires underneath now we're going to open
the<00:01:16.479> junction<00:01:16.900> box<00:01:17.080> insert<00:01:17.770> that<00:01:18.040> cord<00:01:18.430> and

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
the junction box insert that cord and

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.090 
the junction box insert that cord and
we'll<00:01:19.240> run<00:01:19.420> that<00:01:19.660> to<00:01:19.990> the<00:01:20.110> junction<00:01:20.470> on<00:01:20.830> the

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
we'll run that to the junction on the

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:37.460 
we'll run that to the junction on the
brake<00:01:21.310> controller

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.710 

this<00:01:38.470> typically<00:01:38.770> goes<00:01:39.040> on<00:01:39.400> the<00:01:39.910> second<00:01:40.300> socket

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
this typically goes on the second socket

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:53.370 
this typically goes on the second socket
from<00:01:41.590> the<00:01:41.830> left<00:01:42.040> right<00:01:42.310> here<00:01:51.300> that<00:01:52.300> zip<00:01:52.750> tie<00:01:52.960> up

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
from the left right here that zip tie up

00:01:53.380 --> 00:02:08.570 
from the left right here that zip tie up
to<00:01:53.860> a<00:01:53.890> fang<00:01:54.370> at<00:01:54.730> framing<00:01:55.180> up<00:01:55.270> here

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:34.150 

and<00:02:10.140> probably<00:02:11.140> to<00:02:11.590> this<00:02:11.740> table<00:02:12.490> right<00:02:12.640> here

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.650 

okay<00:02:35.160> and<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.490> last<00:02:35.819> step<00:02:36.030> we'll<00:02:36.209> do<00:02:36.330> here<00:02:36.569> is

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
okay and the last step we'll do here is

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:54.580 
okay and the last step we'll do here is
put<00:02:36.840> two<00:02:36.930> cover<00:02:37.140> back<00:02:37.380> on<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:37.680> junction<00:02:37.980> block

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.630 

after<00:02:55.590> installing<00:02:55.860> the<00:02:56.040> brake<00:02:56.220> controller

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
after installing the brake controller

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.550 
after installing the brake controller
and<00:02:56.880> applying<00:02:57.180> power<00:02:57.510> you'll<00:02:57.989> see<00:02:58.230> that<00:02:58.410> the

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
and applying power you'll see that the

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.100 
and applying power you'll see that the
CL<00:02:58.950> comes<00:02:59.459> on<00:02:59.640> that<00:02:59.819> stands<00:03:00.060> for<00:03:00.180> calibration

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
CL comes on that stands for calibration

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.589 
CL comes on that stands for calibration
what<00:03:01.739> you<00:03:01.890> want<00:03:02.069> to<00:03:02.160> do<00:03:02.280> at<00:03:02.400> this<00:03:02.580> step<00:03:02.910> step<00:03:03.390> is

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
what you want to do at this step step is

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:06.640 
what you want to do at this step step is
go<00:03:03.870> ahead<00:03:03.989> and<00:03:04.140> put<00:03:05.099> to<00:03:05.250> hit<00:03:05.790> the<00:03:05.910> vehicle

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
go ahead and put to hit the vehicle

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.699 
go ahead and put to hit the vehicle
brake<00:03:08.300> release<00:03:09.300> it<00:03:09.569> and<00:03:09.720> then<00:03:10.410> hold<00:03:10.590> this

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
brake release it and then hold this

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:16.940 
brake release it and then hold this
button<00:03:10.920> down<00:03:11.069> to<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:11.520> CL<00:03:11.910> disappears<00:03:15.950> and

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
button down to the CL disappears and

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.370 
button down to the CL disappears and
that's<00:03:17.160> at<00:03:17.340> is<00:03:17.520> calibrated<00:03:18.209> and<00:03:18.390> after<00:03:19.230> that

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
that's at is calibrated and after that

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.400 
that's at is calibrated and after that
you<00:03:19.709> set<00:03:20.220> the<00:03:20.400> the<00:03:21.209> mountain<00:03:21.480> power<00:03:21.840> you<00:03:22.170> need

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
you set the the mountain power you need

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.920 
you set the the mountain power you need
for<00:03:23.330> each<00:03:24.330> trailer<00:03:26.209> now<00:03:27.209> we'll<00:03:27.360> do<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.569> test

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
for each trailer now we'll do the test

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.449 
for each trailer now we'll do the test
to<00:03:28.050> make<00:03:28.200> sure<00:03:28.440> that<00:03:28.620> we<00:03:28.739> have<00:03:28.830> current<00:03:29.220> coming

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
to make sure that we have current coming

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.180 
to make sure that we have current coming
out<00:03:29.640> the<00:03:29.819> back<00:03:30.030> of<00:03:30.060> a<00:03:30.330> 7-pole<00:03:30.780> connector<00:03:31.190> you

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
out the back of a 7-pole connector you

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.039 
out the back of a 7-pole connector you
just<00:03:32.459> got<00:03:32.640> a<00:03:32.670> simple<00:03:33.030> faster<00:03:33.450> possible<00:03:33.900> use

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
just got a simple faster possible use

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.220 
just got a simple faster possible use
here<00:03:34.470> so<00:03:34.650> it<00:03:34.980> has<00:03:35.010> do<00:03:35.400> it<00:03:35.549> a<00:03:35.780> kind<00:03:36.780> of<00:03:36.840> a<00:03:36.900> simple

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
here so it has do it a kind of a simple

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.229 
here so it has do it a kind of a simple
trick<00:03:37.440> for<00:03:37.590> ground<00:03:37.860> is<00:03:38.160> sometimes<00:03:38.640> you<00:03:39.030> get

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
trick for ground is sometimes you get

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.930 
trick for ground is sometimes you get
glass<00:03:39.510> tube<00:03:39.870> itself<00:03:40.340> that's<00:03:41.340> how<00:03:41.459> it<00:03:41.610> bolted

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
glass tube itself that's how it bolted

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.309 
glass tube itself that's how it bolted
to<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.090> engine<00:03:42.330> which<00:03:42.450> it's<00:03:42.600> always<00:03:42.840> grounded

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
to the engine which it's always grounded

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:46.430 
to the engine which it's always grounded
we'll<00:03:44.069> go<00:03:44.190> ahead<00:03:44.280> have<00:03:44.940> somebody<00:03:45.380> hold<00:03:46.380> the

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
we'll go ahead have somebody hold the

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.070 
we'll go ahead have somebody hold the
brake<00:03:46.620> down<00:03:46.860> and<00:03:47.220> it'll<00:03:47.549> try

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.080
