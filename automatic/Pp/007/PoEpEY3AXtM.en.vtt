exceptional value most of the models

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.670 
exceptional value most of the models
they<00:00:20.580> have<00:00:20.760> are<00:00:20.970> under<00:00:21.359> 20<00:00:21.630> bucks<00:00:21.869> they're

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
they have are under 20 bucks they're

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.790 
they have are under 20 bucks they're
made<00:00:22.949> in<00:00:23.060> Sweden<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:24.350> they're<00:00:25.350> really<00:00:25.470> just<00:00:25.590> a

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
made in Sweden and they're really just a

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.380 
made in Sweden and they're really just a
basic<00:00:26.010> knife<00:00:26.400> they<00:00:26.609> have<00:00:26.699> different<00:00:26.880> models

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
basic knife they have different models

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.950 
basic knife they have different models
of<00:00:27.539> basic<00:00:28.529> blade<00:00:28.740> thickness<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:30.000> length

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
of basic blade thickness and the length

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.720 
of basic blade thickness and the length
and<00:00:31.260> then<00:00:31.650> whether<00:00:31.800> it's<00:00:32.070> stainless<00:00:32.369> steel<00:00:32.700> or

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
and then whether it's stainless steel or

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.770 
and then whether it's stainless steel or
carbon<00:00:33.239> steel<00:00:33.510> so<00:00:34.170> this<00:00:34.320> is<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.559> 7<00:00:34.950> 11<00:00:35.780> which

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
carbon steel so this is the 7 11 which

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.229 
carbon steel so this is the 7 11 which
is<00:00:36.809> carbon<00:00:37.380> steel<00:00:37.620> it's<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.160> really<00:00:38.520> thick

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
is carbon steel it's the really thick

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.410 
is carbon steel it's the really thick

sharp<00:01:34.110> as<00:01:34.350> is<00:01:35.210> but<00:01:36.210> being<00:01:36.509> carbon<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.409> can<00:01:37.590> you

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
sharp as is but being carbon you can you

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.770 
sharp as is but being carbon you can you
know<00:01:38.130> fairly<00:01:38.610> easy<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:38.909> keep<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.329> sharp<00:01:39.540> as

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
know fairly easy to keep it sharp as

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.410 
know fairly easy to keep it sharp as
well<00:01:40.369> just<00:01:41.369> take<00:01:41.520> care<00:01:41.579> of<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:41.970> so<00:01:42.180> it<00:01:42.390> doesn't

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
well just take care of it so it doesn't

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.719 
well just take care of it so it doesn't
rust<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:43.560> I<00:01:43.619> can<00:01:43.770> see<00:01:43.890> on<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.159> back<00:01:44.399> it's

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
rust and I can see on the back it's

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.190 
rust and I can see on the back it's
probably<00:01:44.939> hard<00:01:45.119> hard<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.570> see<00:01:45.720> on<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.960> camera

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
probably hard hard to see on the camera

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.880 
probably hard hard to see on the camera
but<00:01:47.960> you<00:01:48.960> know<00:01:49.020> probably<00:01:49.140> one<00:01:49.470> way<00:01:49.590> they<00:01:49.740> keep

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
but you know probably one way they keep

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.980 
but you know probably one way they keep
the<00:01:50.009> cost<00:01:50.220> down<00:01:50.369> is<00:01:50.670> they<00:01:51.090> don't<00:01:51.210> like<00:01:51.810> this

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
the cost down is they don't like this

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.719 
the cost down is they don't like this
back<00:01:52.259> edge<00:01:52.500> isn't<00:01:52.710> really<00:01:53.009> ground<00:01:53.280> it's<00:01:53.549> sort
