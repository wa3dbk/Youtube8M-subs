00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
least two gigs of RAM or more ok and

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.399 
least two gigs of RAM or more ok and
then<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.149> hard<00:02:03.329> disk<00:02:03.540> space<00:02:03.750> hopefully<00:02:04.350> you

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
then the hard disk space hopefully you

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.959 
then the hard disk space hopefully you
don't<00:02:04.469> have<00:02:04.619> a<00:02:04.680> problem<00:02:04.890> with<00:02:05.040> that<00:02:05.070> 16<00:02:05.729> gigs

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
don't have a problem with that 16 gigs

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.290 
don't have a problem with that 16 gigs
ok<00:02:06.329> so<00:02:06.390> once<00:02:07.200> you<00:02:07.350> install<00:02:07.860> fusion<00:02:08.429> for<00:02:08.670> you're

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
here and you could always go back and

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.160 
here and you could always go back and
change<00:03:22.120> this<00:03:22.450> so<00:03:23.200> it's<00:03:23.500> not<00:03:23.850> something<00:03:24.850> that's

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170

going to opus to about 2000 and we could

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.789 
going to opus to about 2000 and we could
leave<00:03:36.549> it<00:03:36.639> at<00:03:36.730> one<00:03:36.940> core<00:03:37.269> you<00:03:37.660> could<00:03:37.870> mess

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
leave it at one core you could mess

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:40.490 
leave it at one core you could mess
around<00:03:38.829> with<00:03:39.220> this<00:03:39.370> see<00:03:39.579> what's<00:03:39.790> best<00:03:40.090> and
