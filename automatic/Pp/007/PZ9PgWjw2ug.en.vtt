00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
actually put all the numbers there so if

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.380 
actually put all the numbers there so if
you<00:00:20.220> want<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.520> actual<00:00:20.820> numbers<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:21.330> the

discussion i'm about to do like the
actual<00:00:25.320> hard<00:00:25.500> numbers<00:00:25.890> those<00:00:26.400> are<00:00:26.430> in<00:00:26.910> the

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
actual hard numbers those are in the

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.490 
actual hard numbers those are in the

you<00:00:31.949> can<00:00:32.130> see<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.460> actual<00:00:32.700> numbers<00:00:33.239> there<00:00:33.450> but

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
you can see the actual numbers there but

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.540 
you can see the actual numbers there but
basically<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.320> kind<00:00:34.500> of<00:00:34.559> go<00:00:34.860> roughly<00:00:35.280> or<00:00:35.309> what

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
basically to kind of go roughly or what

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.569 
basically to kind of go roughly or what
they<00:00:35.640> did<00:00:35.820> is<00:00:36.000> that<00:00:36.950> they've<00:00:37.950> made<00:00:37.980> it<00:00:38.340> so<00:00:38.550> that

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
they did is that they've made it so that

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.040 
they did is that they've made it so that
you<00:00:38.760> don't<00:00:38.910> put<00:00:39.030> any<00:00:39.149> points<00:00:39.540> into<00:00:39.690> his<00:00:39.780> ult

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
you don't put any points into his ult

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.299 
you don't put any points into his ult
and<00:00:40.320> then<00:00:40.440> there's<00:00:40.590> all<00:00:40.710> kind<00:00:40.950> of<00:00:41.010> levels

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
and then there's all kind of levels

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.369 
and then there's all kind of levels
automatically<00:00:42.090> at<00:00:42.300> certain<00:00:42.870> levels<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.260> it

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
automatically at certain levels and it

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.610 
automatically at certain levels and it
was<00:00:43.469> like<00:00:43.620> 6<00:00:44.340> 13<00:00:45.059> or<00:00:45.270> stuff<00:00:45.420> like<00:00:45.539> that<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:46.440> it

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
was like 6 13 or stuff like that and it

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.410 
was like 6 13 or stuff like that and it
gets<00:00:46.739> better<00:00:47.010> as<00:00:47.250> levels<00:00:47.700> go<00:00:48.059> up<00:00:48.210> you<00:00:48.329> don't

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
gets better as levels go up you don't

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.209 
gets better as levels go up you don't
put<00:00:48.600> any<00:00:48.719> points<00:00:48.989> into<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.260> which<00:00:49.590> frees<00:00:50.010> up<00:00:50.160> a

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
put any points into it which frees up a

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.350 
put any points into it which frees up a
whole<00:00:50.370> bunch<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:50.700> points<00:00:50.820> which<00:00:51.059> means<00:00:51.270> you

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
whole bunch of points which means you

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.910 
whole bunch of points which means you
can<00:00:51.510> actually<00:00:51.750> put<00:00:51.870> up<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.079> six<00:00:52.379> points<00:00:52.800> in

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
can actually put up to six points in

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.040 
can actually put up to six points in
each<00:00:53.039> one<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.399> his<00:00:53.489> skills<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.120> they<00:00:54.719> scale

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
each one of his skills and they scale

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.389 
each one of his skills and they scale
accordingly<00:00:56.149> ultimately<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:58.050> DIA<00:00:58.890> according

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
accordingly ultimately the DIA according

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.369 
accordingly ultimately the DIA according
to<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.550> numbers<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.059> abilities<00:01:00.840> tend<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.260> end

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
to the numbers the abilities tend to end

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.070 
to the numbers the abilities tend to end
up<00:01:01.530> slightly<00:01:02.070> better<00:01:02.489> at<00:01:02.820> max<00:01:03.510> level<00:01:03.660> than

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
up slightly better at max level than

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.109 
up slightly better at max level than
their<00:01:04.290> non-mac<00:01:05.070> storm<00:01:05.430> their<00:01:05.640> current<00:01:05.909> max

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
their non-mac storm their current max

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.010 
their non-mac storm their current max
counterparts<00:01:06.810> at<00:01:07.400> just<00:01:08.400> five<00:01:08.640> points<00:01:08.780> on<00:01:09.780> like

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
counterparts at just five points on like

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.980 
counterparts at just five points on like
they<00:01:10.200> are<00:01:10.290> on<00:01:10.439> live<00:01:10.670> so<00:01:11.670> that<00:01:11.700> might<00:01:12.270> do<00:01:12.750> some

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
they are on live so that might do some

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.780 
they are on live so that might do some
interesting<00:01:13.200> things<00:01:13.409> for<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.799> scaling<00:01:14.340> I<00:01:14.460> don't

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
interesting things for a scaling I don't

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.190 
interesting things for a scaling I don't
really<00:01:14.909> know<00:01:15.119> here's<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.570> thing<00:01:15.780> like<00:01:15.990> I

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
really know here's the thing like I

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.890 
really know here's the thing like I
don't<00:01:16.830> play<00:01:17.220> Jase<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:18.119> don't<00:01:18.479> have<00:01:18.570> too<00:01:18.659> much<00:01:18.780> to

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
don't play Jase I don't have too much to

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.600 
don't play Jase I don't have too much to
say<00:01:18.930> about<00:01:19.170> him<00:01:19.380> which<00:01:20.250> is<00:01:20.369> one<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:20.549> the

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
say about him which is one of the

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:21.740 
say about him which is one of the
reasons<00:01:20.880> I<00:01:20.909> but<00:01:21.060> do<00:01:21.150> some<00:01:21.330> of<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.450> end<00:01:21.600> here

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
reasons I but do some of the end here

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.219 
reasons I but do some of the end here
which<00:01:21.900> is<00:01:21.990> kind<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.229> neat<00:01:22.380> but<00:01:23.750> all<00:01:24.750> I<00:01:24.810> really

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
which is kind of neat but all I really

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.320 
which is kind of neat but all I really
remember<00:01:25.380> about<00:01:25.799> Jace<00:01:26.340> is<00:01:26.580> that<00:01:27.090> he<00:01:27.180> was

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
remember about Jace is that he was

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.179 
remember about Jace is that he was
horrendously<00:01:28.020> overpowered<00:01:28.590> at<00:01:28.680> release<00:01:28.950> like

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
horrendously overpowered at release like

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.399 
horrendously overpowered at release like
he<00:01:29.280> was<00:01:29.400> just<00:01:29.430> stupid<00:01:29.909> because<00:01:30.210> Jace<00:01:30.570> even

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
he was just stupid because Jace even

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.810 
he was just stupid because Jace even
today<00:01:31.500> still<00:01:31.829> is<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:31.950> really<00:01:32.340> really<00:01:32.369> good<00:01:32.610> kid

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
today still is a really really good kid

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.310 
today still is a really really good kid
he's<00:01:32.939> got<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.090> very<00:01:33.390> diverse<00:01:33.630> kit<00:01:34.049> that<00:01:34.200> does

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
he's got a very diverse kit that does

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.010 
he's got a very diverse kit that does
practically<00:01:34.920> everything<00:01:35.189> you<00:01:35.460> need<00:01:35.840> the<00:01:36.840> only

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
practically everything you need the only

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.240 
practically everything you need the only
thing<00:01:37.140> he's<00:01:37.259> really<00:01:37.619> missing<00:01:37.799> is<00:01:38.100> like

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
thing he's really missing is like

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.590 
thing he's really missing is like
sustain<00:01:38.670> he<00:01:38.880> can<00:01:39.000> do<00:01:39.090> pretty<00:01:39.240> much<00:01:39.390> everything

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
sustain he can do pretty much everything

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.560 
sustain he can do pretty much everything
else<00:01:41.780> so<00:01:43.220> yeah<00:01:44.220> they<00:01:44.640> tuned<00:01:44.880> his<00:01:45.030> numbers<00:01:45.390> down

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
else so yeah they tuned his numbers down

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.999 
else so yeah they tuned his numbers down
since<00:01:46.020> then<00:01:46.200> obviously<00:01:46.350> because<00:01:46.829> you<00:01:46.920> know

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
since then obviously because you know

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.090 
since then obviously because you know
Jace<00:01:47.220> isn't<00:01:47.520> exactly<00:01:48.320> you<00:01:49.320> see<00:01:49.619> him<00:01:49.770> every

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
Jace isn't exactly you see him every

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.380 
Jace isn't exactly you see him every
single<00:01:50.280> game<00:01:50.579> like<00:01:50.820> he<00:01:50.939> was<00:01:51.090> in<00:01:51.240> Mo's

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
single game like he was in Mo's

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.940 
single game like he was in Mo's
everything<00:01:51.689> it<00:01:51.750> was<00:01:51.840> like<00:01:51.930> season<00:01:52.320> two<00:01:52.560> when

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
everything it was like season two when

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.499 
everything it was like season two when
he<00:01:53.070> was<00:01:53.220> pretty<00:01:53.460> crazy<00:01:53.670> good<00:01:55.250> so<00:01:56.250> yeah<00:01:56.520> but<00:01:57.329> in

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
he was pretty crazy good so yeah but in

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.300 
he was pretty crazy good so yeah but in
terms<00:01:57.689> of<00:01:57.869> modern<00:01:58.290> Jace<00:01:58.560> what<00:01:58.829> this<00:01:58.979> means<00:01:59.219> to

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
terms of modern Jace what this means to

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.209 
terms of modern Jace what this means to
him<00:01:59.460> I<00:01:59.579> don't<00:01:59.759> really<00:01:59.909> know<00:02:00.119> so<00:02:00.329> instead<00:02:01.049> of

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
to mute them because this is from his
