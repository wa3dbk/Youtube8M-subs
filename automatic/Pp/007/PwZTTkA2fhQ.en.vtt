00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
the details are on the bottom here I was

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.160 
the details are on the bottom here I was
just<00:03:24.730> all<00:03:24.910> coming<00:03:25.150> up<00:03:25.299> jagged<00:03:25.750> edges<00:03:25.870> like

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
just all coming up jagged edges like

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.110 
just all coming up jagged edges like
that<00:03:26.350> so<00:03:26.470> it<00:03:26.620> actually<00:03:26.830> looks<00:03:27.310> like<00:03:27.459> whatever

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
that so it actually looks like whatever

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.449

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
it's forcing him up is actually bouncing

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:31.199 
it's forcing him up is actually bouncing
off<00:03:30.610> the<00:03:30.790> ground

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
off the ground

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:32.880
