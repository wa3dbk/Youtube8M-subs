about the driving simulator i'm sitting
in<00:00:17.199> Tim<00:00:18.199> this<00:00:18.230> is<00:00:18.380> our<00:00:18.619> five<00:00:19.189> channel<00:00:19.699> which

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:19.820 
in Tim this is our five channel which

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.029 
in Tim this is our five channel which
means<00:00:20.060> 5<00:00:20.269> screen<00:00:20.630> simulator<00:00:21.140> it<00:00:21.589> gives<00:00:21.769> us<00:00:21.919> a

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:22.039 
means 5 screen simulator it gives us a

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.300 
means 5 screen simulator it gives us a
full<00:00:22.220> 225<00:00:23.089> degrees<00:00:23.480> view<00:00:24.320> so<00:00:24.859> that<00:00:24.890> the<00:00:25.099> driver

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
full 225 degrees view so that the driver

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:26.800 
full 225 degrees view so that the driver
when<00:00:25.550> he's<00:00:25.640> driving<00:00:25.880> these<00:00:26.089> situations<00:00:26.630> have

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
when he's driving these situations have

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.480 
when he's driving these situations have
to<00:00:26.929> actually<00:00:27.079> turn<00:00:27.409> their<00:00:27.589> head<00:00:27.769> to<00:00:28.220> clear

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
to actually turn their head to clear

simulators<00:00:43.579> are<00:00:43.609> all<00:00:43.910> about<00:00:44.149> judgment<00:00:44.750> and

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:44.899 
simulators are all about judgment and

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:47.500 
simulators are all about judgment and
decision-making<00:00:45.579> ok<00:00:46.579> ready<00:00:46.969> to<00:00:47.149> go<00:00:47.269> let's

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
decision-making ok ready to go let's

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.450 
decision-making ok ready to go let's
give<00:00:47.660> it<00:00:47.690> a<00:00:47.780> shot<00:00:47.980> so<00:00:48.980> in<00:00:49.190> this<00:00:49.280> particular

you're running and go ahead and bring it

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.009 
you're running and go ahead and bring it
in<00:00:57.980> to<00:00:58.070> drive<00:00:58.309> now<00:00:59.120> as<00:00:59.449> you're<00:00:59.690> sitting<00:00:59.809> in

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:00.019 
in to drive now as you're sitting in

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:01.810 
in to drive now as you're sitting in
this<00:01:00.109> scenario<00:01:00.309> you've<00:01:01.309> already<00:01:01.640> checked

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
this scenario you've already checked

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.630 
this scenario you've already checked
this<00:01:02.230> individual<00:01:03.230> and<00:01:03.440> you<00:01:04.129> have<00:01:04.250> found<00:01:04.430> that

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
he has a warrant for murder and now you

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.340 
he has a warrant for murder and now you
need<00:01:07.220> to<00:01:07.310> go<00:01:07.400> in<00:01:07.520> pursuit<00:01:07.850> so<00:01:08.450> take<00:01:08.780> off<00:01:08.960> after

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
need to go in pursuit so take off after

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.820 
need to go in pursuit so take off after
him

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
him

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:18.440 
him
I

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.090 

there<00:01:19.450> you<00:01:19.569> go<00:01:19.689> and<00:01:19.899> you're<00:01:19.960> in<00:01:20.109> pursuit<00:01:20.439> so

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
there you go and you're in pursuit so

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.010 
there you go and you're in pursuit so
now<00:01:21.249> we<00:01:21.310> would<00:01:21.579> be<00:01:21.700> having<00:01:21.880> you<00:01:22.149> lost<00:01:22.630> it<00:01:22.840> good

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
now we would be having you lost it good

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.899 
now we would be having you lost it good
night<00:01:23.229> that's<00:01:23.979> actually<00:01:24.189> why<00:01:24.429> we<00:01:24.670> have<00:01:24.789> the

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 
night that's actually why we have the

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:27.510 
night that's actually why we have the
driver<00:01:25.119> simulator<00:01:25.390> because<00:01:26.170> basically<00:01:27.009> now

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
driver simulator because basically now

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.219 
driver simulator because basically now
that<00:01:27.789> you<00:01:27.909> pass<00:01:28.179> that<00:01:28.420> intersection<00:01:28.810> that<00:01:28.960> was

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
that you pass that intersection that was

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.679 
that you pass that intersection that was
hurt<00:01:29.409> we<00:01:29.950> can<00:01:30.100> go<00:01:30.189> back<00:01:30.369> we<00:01:30.670> can<00:01:30.850> jump<00:01:31.179> back<00:01:31.390> on

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:31.689 
hurt we can go back we can jump back on

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:34.289 
hurt we can go back we can jump back on
it<00:01:31.840> we<00:01:32.350> can<00:01:32.499> restart<00:01:32.920> it<00:01:33.100> and<00:01:33.219> now<00:01:33.939> we<00:01:34.000> can<00:01:34.240> have

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:34.299 
it we can restart it and now we can have

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:35.819 
it we can restart it and now we can have
your<00:01:34.450> rerun<00:01:34.719> it<00:01:34.750> again<00:01:34.899> and<00:01:35.319> this<00:01:35.439> time<00:01:35.500> you

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:35.829 
your rerun it again and this time you

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:38.099 
your rerun it again and this time you
won't<00:01:35.859> crash<00:01:36.159> okay<00:01:36.969> that's<00:01:37.359> the<00:01:37.509> that's<00:01:37.929> the

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:38.109 
won't crash okay that's the that's the

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:40.199 
won't crash okay that's the that's the
true<00:01:38.619> value<00:01:38.979> of<00:01:39.009> the<00:01:39.189> driver<00:01:39.399> simulator<00:01:39.640> so

00:01:40.199 --> 00:01:40.209 
true value of the driver simulator so

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:42.449 
true value of the driver simulator so
put<00:01:40.390> it<00:01:40.479> back<00:01:40.599> in<00:01:40.719> the<00:01:40.810> park<00:01:41.250> put<00:01:42.250> her<00:01:42.310> in<00:01:42.369> the

put it back in the park put her in the

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:44.730 
put it back in the park put her in the
park<00:01:42.670> go<00:01:43.299> ahead<00:01:43.420> and<00:01:43.539> start<00:01:43.689> your<00:01:43.840> car<00:01:43.959> up<00:01:44.140> from

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:31.380 

as<00:03:26.710> a<00:03:26.800> mind<00:03:27.100> of<00:03:27.190> his<00:03:27.280> own<00:03:27.430> done<00:03:29.460> with<00:03:30.460> the<00:03:30.640> there

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
as a mind of his own done with the there

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.230 
as a mind of his own done with the there
seem<00:03:31.570> to<00:03:31.600> be<00:03:31.750> a<00:03:32.290> lot<00:03:33.010> more<00:03:33.070> or<00:03:33.700> a<00:03:33.760> lot<00:03:34.000> less

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:34.240 
seem to be a lot more or a lot less

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.360 
seem to be a lot more or a lot less
control<00:03:34.750> than<00:03:35.050> I<00:03:35.080> expected<00:03:35.290> with<00:03:35.920> this<00:03:36.130> that<00:03:36.340> I

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
control than I expected with this that I

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.250 
control than I expected with this that I
was<00:03:36.640> I<00:03:36.910> was<00:03:37.300> doing<00:03:37.570> a<00:03:37.600> lot<00:03:37.690> of<00:03:37.750> fish<00:03:37.990> tailing

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
was I was doing a lot of fish tailing

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.730 
was I was doing a lot of fish tailing
and<00:03:38.740> it's<00:03:39.370> getting<00:03:39.790> out<00:03:39.880> it<00:03:40.530> part<00:03:41.530> of<00:03:41.590> that<00:03:41.650> is

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:41.740 
and it's getting out it part of that is

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.440 
and it's getting out it part of that is
the<00:03:42.010> acclimation<00:03:42.610> to<00:03:42.640> the<00:03:42.880> system<00:03:43.180> itself

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
the acclimation to the system itself

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.360 
the acclimation to the system itself
it's<00:03:43.930> like<00:03:44.050> driving<00:03:44.290> any<00:03:44.590> new<00:03:44.800> car<00:03:45.040> that<00:03:45.250> you

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
it's like driving any new car that you

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.620 
it's like driving any new car that you
get<00:03:45.550> your<00:03:45.580> fleet<00:03:45.910> you<00:03:46.300> have<00:03:46.420> to<00:03:46.510> have<00:03:46.600> a

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
get your fleet you have to have a

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.390 
get your fleet you have to have a
certain<00:03:46.810> amount<00:03:47.020> of<00:03:47.140> time<00:03:47.260> to<00:03:47.440> acclimate<00:03:47.860> if

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
certain amount of time to acclimate if

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.620 
certain amount of time to acclimate if
we<00:03:48.610> give<00:03:48.730> you<00:03:48.850> an<00:03:48.940> acclimation<00:03:49.510> period

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
we give you an acclimation period

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.510 
we give you an acclimation period
adaptation<00:03:50.410> period<00:03:50.590> then<00:03:51.010> you<00:03:51.160> would<00:03:51.280> get<00:03:51.400> the

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
adaptation period then you would get the

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.800 
adaptation period then you would get the
controls<00:03:51.940> down<00:03:52.030> and<00:03:52.510> then<00:03:52.630> you<00:03:52.720> would

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
controls down and then you would

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.660 
controls down and then you would
understand<00:03:53.230> have<00:03:53.440> a<00:03:53.470> speed<00:03:53.800> appreciation<00:03:54.490> and

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
understand have a speed appreciation and
