mullet like this from a single log the

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.590 
mullet like this from a single log the
first<00:00:07.290> step<00:00:07.560> is<00:00:07.740> to<00:00:07.919> use<00:00:07.950> a<00:00:08.430> chainsaw<00:00:08.940> or<00:00:09.450> bow

saw to trim down to where the handles
going<00:00:12.270> to<00:00:12.449> be<00:00:12.600> so<00:00:13.289> I'll<00:00:13.500> do<00:00:13.650> that<00:00:13.799> now

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.590 

okay<00:00:58.050> so<00:00:58.530> now<00:00:59.039> that's<00:00:59.219> ready<00:00:59.519> to<00:00:59.789> trim<00:01:00.390> the

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
okay so now that's ready to trim the

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
wood off down to this edge here and

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.280 
wood off down to this edge here and
we're<00:01:03.269> going<00:01:03.360> to<00:01:03.420> do<00:01:03.540> that<00:01:03.690> using<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:04.140> side<00:01:04.350> axe

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
we're going to do that using a side axe

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.630 
we're going to do that using a side axe
okay<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.409> next<00:01:07.590> step<00:01:07.680> is<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.100> use<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.430> side

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
okay the next step is to use the side

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.719 
okay the next step is to use the side
axe<00:01:08.880> now<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.180> trim<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.869> handle<00:01:10.259> down<00:01:10.440> so<00:01:11.340> you

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
axe now to trim the handle down so you

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.690 
axe now to trim the handle down so you
basically<00:01:12.149> just<00:01:12.240> try<00:01:16.220> as<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.310> can<00:01:17.430> see<00:01:17.580> as<00:01:17.670> you

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
basically just try as you can see as you

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:27.100 
basically just try as you can see as you
reach<00:01:18.619> the<00:01:19.619> slot<00:01:19.950> I've<00:01:20.190> cut<00:01:20.520> earlier
