sure my right hand is on top to prevent

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.859 
sure my right hand is on top to prevent
muscular<00:01:14.220> imbalances<00:01:14.760> so<00:01:15.000> I'm<00:01:15.570> going<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.780> get

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
muscular imbalances so I'm going to get

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:23.020 
muscular imbalances so I'm going to get
up<00:01:15.990> hips<00:01:16.799> up<00:01:17.070> row

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.650 

and<00:01:24.100> that's<00:01:25.100> a<00:01:25.250> good<00:01:25.550> encrypt<00:01:26.180> strengthening

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:26.660 
and that's a good encrypt strengthening

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.360 
and that's a good encrypt strengthening
exercise<00:01:27.080> now<00:01:27.710> let's<00:01:27.920> make<00:01:28.040> a<00:01:28.100> little<00:01:28.220> bit

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.370 
exercise now let's make a little bit

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:29.920 
exercise now let's make a little bit
more<00:01:28.490> difficult<00:01:28.970> so<00:01:29.420> that<00:01:29.450> was<00:01:29.630> kind<00:01:29.780> of<00:01:29.840> easy

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
more difficult so that was kind of easy

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.900 
more difficult so that was kind of easy
right<00:01:30.290> well<00:01:30.740> let's<00:01:30.920> step<00:01:31.070> up<00:01:31.250> the<00:01:31.340> difficulty

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:31.910 
right well let's step up the difficulty

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.010 
right well let's step up the difficulty
a<00:01:31.970> little<00:01:32.150> bit<00:01:32.240> we're<00:01:32.360> gonna<00:01:32.420> use<00:01:32.750> this

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
a little bit we're gonna use this

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.140 
a little bit we're gonna use this
exercise<00:01:33.680> ball<00:01:33.920> and<00:01:34.190> this<00:01:34.790> is<00:01:34.850> going<00:01:35.090> to

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
exercise ball and this is going to

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.780 
exercise ball and this is going to
engage<00:01:35.300> more<00:01:35.690> core<00:01:36.020> and<00:01:36.260> stability<00:01:36.830> so<00:01:37.640> we

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
engage more core and stability so we

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.520 
engage more core and stability so we
really<00:01:38.240> have<00:01:38.390> to<00:01:38.630> kind<00:01:38.870> of<00:01:38.960> tighten

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
really have to kind of tighten

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:40.930 
really have to kind of tighten
everything<00:01:39.740> up<00:01:40.070> and<00:01:40.250> make<00:01:40.430> sure<00:01:40.610> that<00:01:40.790> we

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
everything up and make sure that we

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.540 
everything up and make sure that we
don't<00:01:41.090> wobble<00:01:41.390> and<00:01:41.750> fall<00:01:41.960> off<00:01:42.530> the<00:01:42.680> bar<00:01:42.860> so

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
don't wobble and fall off the bar so

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:50.160 
don't wobble and fall off the bar so
let's<00:01:44.150> go<00:01:44.270> ahead<00:01:44.390> and<00:01:44.510> get<00:01:44.720> into<00:01:44.840> this<00:01:45.020> you

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.910 

don't<00:01:51.170> have<00:01:51.290> to<00:01:51.440> do<00:01:51.500> that<00:01:51.619> I'm<00:01:51.740> just<00:01:51.890> doing

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
that for fun but oh my god see the

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.109 
that for fun but oh my god see the
stability<00:01:57.290> adds<00:01:58.280> a<00:01:58.490> whole<00:01:58.640> different<00:01:59.030> element
