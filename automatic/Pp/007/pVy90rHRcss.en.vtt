just found they were dollar for two and

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.050 
just found they were dollar for two and
by<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.070> way<00:01:11.220> they<00:01:11.369> are<00:01:11.490> good<00:01:11.700> if<00:01:11.820> you'd<00:01:11.939> like

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
by the way they are good if you'd like

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.320 
by the way they are good if you'd like
to<00:01:12.240> make<00:01:12.390> some<00:01:12.600> dividers<00:01:13.470> as<00:01:13.830> well<00:01:14.150> they<00:01:15.150> come

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
to make some dividers as well they come

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.570 
to make some dividers as well they come
in<00:01:15.450> this<00:01:15.630> size<00:01:16.310> large<00:01:17.310> square<00:01:18.110> jakes<00:01:19.580> large

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
in this size large square jakes large

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.109 
in this size large square jakes large
square<00:01:21.229> which<00:01:22.229> I'm<00:01:22.619> not<00:01:22.890> real<00:01:23.280> sure<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.939> can

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
square which I'm not real sure you can

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.940 
square which I'm not real sure you can
see<00:01:25.369> but<00:01:26.369> it's<00:01:27.180> larger<00:01:27.720> than<00:01:27.750> one<00:01:28.049> of<00:01:28.320> my<00:01:28.530> pages

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
see but it's larger than one of my pages

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.020 
see but it's larger than one of my pages
in<00:01:29.340> my<00:01:29.820> journal<00:01:30.299> book<00:01:31.400> and<00:01:32.400> then<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.729> smaller

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
in my journal book and then the smaller

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.960 
in my journal book and then the smaller
one<00:01:34.220> obviously<00:01:35.220> is<00:01:35.280> smaller

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
one obviously is smaller

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.859 
one obviously is smaller
I<00:01:37.490> don't<00:01:38.490> maybe<00:01:39.030> you<00:01:39.240> can<00:01:39.390> see<00:01:39.630> with<00:01:39.780> the

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
I don't maybe you can see with the

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.090 
I don't maybe you can see with the
reflection<00:01:40.530> how<00:01:40.740> small<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:42.229> now<00:01:43.229> these<00:01:43.380> on

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
reflection how small it is now these on

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.670 
reflection how small it is now these on
the<00:01:44.430> bottom<00:01:44.850> side<00:01:45.210> they're<00:01:45.509> textured<00:01:45.990> again

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
the bottom side they're textured again

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
through a bowl on the microwave and I

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.389 
through a bowl on the microwave and I
was<00:01:51.810> concerned<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.380> if<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.710> pushed<00:01:53.040> hard

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
was concerned that if I pushed hard

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.569 
was concerned that if I pushed hard
enough<00:01:53.549> on<00:01:53.850> these<00:01:54.000> they<00:01:54.329> might<00:01:54.600> leave<00:01:55.460> and<00:01:56.460> the

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
enough on these they might leave and the
