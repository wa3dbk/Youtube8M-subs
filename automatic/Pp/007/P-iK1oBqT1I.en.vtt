00:00:00.609 --> 00:00:07.149
 that's the nice case unfortunately in black 

00:00:04.399 --> 00:00:10.369
 a bipartite hardcase for that 

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:12.110
 iphone 5 from the vendor i have 

00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:13.789
 I do not know if I'm just right 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:22.880
 uttered'm typing them on 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:24.170
 every case voyager1 to acquire a link 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.820
 to the article you will find as always in 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.500
 the description of this video about 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.390
 I would buy myself through this link 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.530
 look forward to it because you support this 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:36.170
 youtube channel yes the case black and 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.899
 Although matt black looks relatively elegant 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.749
 just in contrast to the most 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:43.399
 shiny iphone 5 and white areas 

00:00:41.749 --> 00:00:45.050
 the bag feels quality 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:46.190
 really very high quality is on 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.010
 not to compare with the others 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.319
 bags that cost half as much and it 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.149
 is as I said a two-part case that 

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:55.069
 First, the iphone is called 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:57.829
 pushed in it is also relatively 

00:00:55.069 --> 00:01:00.139
 rigid on not too tight and then will 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.350
 the lower part and again set 

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:05.870
 it is also heavier 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:08.030
 the case is almost on the frame 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:12.050
 of the iphones gets stuck there a bit 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:14.180
 sideways yes and the conclusion 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.270
 between upper and lower shell is 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.040
 actually relatively good 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.680
 You can all buttons very very well 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.150
 reach there is nothing that the function 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.470
 the buttons, so to speak, through cash life 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.760
 but you always press the 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:30.920
 original buttons for it are appropriate 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:33.590
 Slots on the case side available 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.660
 the case as such really works 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.390
 very very good to touch it 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:40.370
 as I have said is not high gloss 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.360
 is and it almost feels a little bit 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:47.120
 gummed that's really wonderful 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.440
 and if you look at the case from the 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.540
 Seen close you can also see that 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.120
 the processing is relatively high quality 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.370
 that there is nothing great and 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.830
 the bag just keeps relatively accurate 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.690
 Made by is down are 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.130
 all connections very easily accessible 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.380
 Manufacturer even writes that one 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:07.010
 just the bottom of the case 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.630
 then has to lose weight and then the phone 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.490
 in each docking station also still place 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.440
 finds 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.000
 yes good for this each time 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.440
 I would not do it 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.270
 Here we can finish again 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.580
 between the lower and the upper side of the 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.410
 see cases and what looks worse 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.520
 when it feels like it's coming too 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.550
 is really very nice 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.500
 still there is a files one 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.330
 a frame on the side where the 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.310
 display of the iphones has the 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.110
 advantage that you can also use the iphone 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.600
 The glassworks on a flat 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.220
 surface left without fear 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.530
 the display must have the camera 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.450
 Cutouts looks very nice 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.820
 not just oval or as well 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.760
 always milled freely but also has one 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:48.820
 very wonderful shape yes, here I have 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.320
 another wooden docking station in 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.480
 have presented another video 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.330
 synonymous here, the case fits in without that 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.700
 you have to take something off that 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.460
 works relatively well yes 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.430
 overall a wonderful for the price 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:05.110
 case someone who buy one 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.460
 really want to go to this 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.340
 grab it and just give it a try 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:11.110
 As always in the link there is the link 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.630
 Description of the leads you then 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.820
 Amazon for the appropriate product yes 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.250
 and i would talk about comments 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.890
 thumbs upwards and you are allowed
