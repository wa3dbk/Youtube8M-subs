00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.550
 with him 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.810
 and found us this youtube channel 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:26.140
 strongman tarraco and good we will attend 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:28.630
 a question that some of us have asked 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.770
 so much of the people that we carry 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.259
 out with our workouts 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.540
 hybrids like the people they catch 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.519
 our daily training of 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.960
 training in the channel and good 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:39.550
 us as you know in others 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.190
 hybrid trainings in the 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.650
 hypertrophy let's go a lot the series 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:49.210
 worth short series on going long for 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:51.190
 up and down then many many 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.070
 from our customers our followers 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:57.039
 they asked us if the weight was much lower 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:00.489
 to finish them with pes do not hypertrophy and 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:03.969
 have the doubt for example if a 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:07.330
 pyramid ends up being two series of 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:10.179
 five two of ten and two of 15 clear in 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.910
 the series of 15 the weight have it that 

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:15.729
 go down a lot to complete the series of 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:18.930
 15 well, in terms of aesthetics and 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:23.090
 hypertrophy that nobody cares 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:26.820
 if your muscles need to go 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.980
 even if it's a kilo to finish the 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.900
 networks is that the cii is stimulated 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:34.500
 portion 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:37.270
 it does not depend on the weight that moves 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.720
 it depends on stimuli that the 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.200
 muscle 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.909
 and of congestion and some other factor 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.159
 to then grow 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.469
 if it turns out that during training 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.600
 we for example crush the chest 

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:54.810
 and the sad one in such a way that in the 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.869
 last series to finish press with 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.580
 cufflinks shrink valves 4 no 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.280
 nothing happens 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.440
 just do it for more our 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.950
 musculature can not go on but it's already 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.349
 stimulated 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.410
 over time probably instead of 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:14.390
 to finish with four turns we will finish with 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.810
 eight and fine one day we'll do with 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.330
 40 but the important thing is to finish the 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.480
 repetitions and then obviously 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.020
 we have to look for the weight that we 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.020
 we can finish 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.670
 but as low as that weight 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.230
 when there are people who at the end of the 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.470
 prayer that was founded are push-ups 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.320
 then he can not do a perfect 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:40.250
 perfect annihilated muscle stimulation 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:43.890
 total which is neither an annihilate 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:47.100
 full goal for home if they were 50 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:50.640
 because tomorrow or the week generates 5 the 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.620
 another the ones from the other 15 a little bit 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.890
 we will progress until it equals grass 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.930
 50 or 100 with thirst 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.930
 or maybe at some point travel change 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:04.000
 of training because that subject 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:07.599
 and the gel if you are adapted to it 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.819
 but until then a problem does not 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:12.670
 worry people of hypertrophy and 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.200
 of the aesthetics by the weight that you move the 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.230
 weight that you move unlike the 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.840
 force is just not the thing 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:23.049
 basic is just a driver for our 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.659
 objective is only the person in charge of 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:29.650
 stimulus to bring blood to the muscle of 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:32.600
 congest of breaking fibers but it's 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:37.780
 same as two that 200 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:40.340
 if you play the 15th back and with 2 14 15 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.770
 no problem that will not affect for 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.650
 nothing hypertrophy 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:47.370
 is perfectly stimulated we are 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:50.760
 in agreement you are not fins of force 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:53.610
 therefore letting be the weight you have 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.110
 to feel that weight and if really with 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.019
 two kilos or what you 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.970
 you consider little weight 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:02.190
 you can not almost reach the series is that 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.680
 send or for the series to arrive 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.870
 flocks you have to take a weight and over 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.170
 what happened is that the musculature is 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:12.209
 stimulated and is to my city so 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.280
 So much work is well done that 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.109
 nobody worry about that bit by bit 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.000
 We will progress to conform 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.919
 Musculature is bigger comfort 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.430
 We are growing 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:25.440
 the body weight those weights with which 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.570
 do those repetitions that sometimes 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.639
 you will be taller you will go 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.169
 adapting to the training and that flex that 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:33.330
 you can not do one then just 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:36.030
 undoing action and with the 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:38.340
 your adaptation process but not you 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.009
 worry the muscle is perfectly 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.919
 stimulated and what has already been said in the 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:46.910
 moment that I am is that he removed all the 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:50.480
 weight of the pole and I do not have how to get it out 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:52.820
 ready of papers tomorrow another day that 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:56.600
 muscle no longer do more or agree 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:57.860
 that working with low weights has nothing 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.840
 what to do with hypertrophy to 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.700
 hypertrophy that stimulate that 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.470
 muscle in our workouts what 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.690
 stimulate one hundred percent until the 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.430
 point that annihilate in such a way that 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.800
 that has a flex 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.650
 Many of you tell me calmly with the 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.860
 we will do a lot of time but that does not affect 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:18.759
 for nothing to hypertrophy 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.969
 you are looking for hypertrophy I do not know if behind 

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:22.539
 of force 

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:24.409
 always have clear concepts 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:26.629
 you for hypertrophy that 

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:28.279
 stimulate the muscle and against the weight the 

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:28.959
 muscle can be stimulated with two kilos 

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:32.449
 of with 2000 

00:05:28.959 --> 00:05:35.269
 the important thing is to stimulate congestion 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:37.549
 by breaking fibers and finally annihilating it 

00:05:35.269 --> 00:05:40.219
 even with giant beings with three 

00:05:37.549 --> 00:05:42.229
 series is little with little weight or that other 

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:45.199
 shredded muscle that's very important 

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:47.539
 because then when eating and resting he already 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:50.299
 has received the message the month for vila 

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:52.489
 or this one has part of the memories not 

00:05:50.299 --> 00:05:55.009
 do not worry that nobody cares about 

00:05:52.489 --> 00:05:56.269
 this one for this concept of agreement then 

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:57.349
 well we hope we have answered this 

00:05:56.269 --> 00:05:59.959
 question that we found interesting 

00:05:57.349 --> 00:06:02.119
 and many people had made us separate 

00:05:59.959 --> 00:06:03.949
 always good what is the encouragement for 

00:06:02.119 --> 00:06:05.779
 the hypertrophy of what an athlete is 

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:07.759
 force that you do not give that I do not care 

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:09.860
 stimulus what you eat to carry the weight 

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:12.259
 from point a to b and that is very different 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:14.989
 door cookie if you give me the weight 

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:16.699
 because it is your goal you who give 

00:06:14.989 --> 00:06:19.729
 hypertrophy and aesthetics the weight 

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:22.969
 it's just a driver is what you 

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:25.129
 help is your driver towards 

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:28.099
 hypertrophy but in no case is 

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:30.169
 your primary objective is something 

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:32.749
 secondary you with manage 

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:34.969
 stimulate breaking fibers and weight 

00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:36.800
 worked is entirely secondary to 

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:38.209
 I agree well what I said we hope 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.459
 have clarified this question and has 

00:06:38.209 --> 00:06:42.679
 it seemed interesting this concept that 

00:06:40.459 --> 00:06:44.300
 Be clear and good as always if 

00:06:42.679 --> 00:06:47.019
 you want see you next videos 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.019
 many thanks 

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:56.060
 do not
