to stand further away from the feeder to

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:19.180 
to stand further away from the feeder to
add<00:02:01.240> more<00:02:01.450> difficulty

in this next two-part exercise I use the

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.020 
in this next two-part exercise I use the
Boylan<00:02:24.350> movement<00:02:24.830> to<00:02:25.040> ensure<00:02:25.400> players<00:02:25.700> bend

Boylan movement to ensure players bend
their<00:02:26.210> knees<00:02:26.390> for<00:02:26.420> speed<00:02:27.020> also<00:02:27.860> to<00:02:28.370> maintain<00:02:28.760> a

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
their knees for speed also to maintain a

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.630 
their knees for speed also to maintain a
constant<00:02:29.150> position<00:02:29.990> rather<00:02:30.650> than<00:02:30.920> rising<00:02:31.160> too

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
constant position rather than rising too

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.660 
constant position rather than rising too
soon<00:02:31.970> before<00:02:32.180> striking<00:02:32.720> the<00:02:32.990> shuttle<00:02:33.440> and
