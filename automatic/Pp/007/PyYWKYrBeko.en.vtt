00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.569
 chemical peels are 

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:06.430
 non-invasive cosmetic procedures 

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:08.860
 most popular 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:11.170
 rejuvenate the appearance of the skin as 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:14.680
 time factors such as damage caused by 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:16.990
 sun heredity and diet movements 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.480
 repetitive movements of muscles contribute to 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.869
 the formation of lines and wrinkles on the face 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.340
 in addition the development of 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.980
 irregularities of pigmentation or 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.350
 acne scars can cause the 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.070
 skin lose its softness and appearance 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.559
 young 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.530
 often performed on the neck face 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:37.839
 and hands the different types of peelings 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.569
 chemicals can reduce the appearance of 

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:42.760
 facial wrinkles scars and pigmentation 

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:46.210
 as well as treat injuries 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:48.399
 precancerous skin in general 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.870
 average peelings produce better results. 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:51.909
 expressive than peelings 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.159
 because it penetrates more 

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:55.960
 deep into the layers of the skin 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:57.639
 usually the medium tires are 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.609
 carried out using what is 

00:00:57.639 --> 00:01:02.499
 known as trichloroacetic acid which 

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:05.079
 can be used with the solution of 

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:06.430
 with glycolic acid for 

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:08.890
 improve treatment outcomes 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.750
 such as superficial peels 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.869
 the results of treatment depends on the 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.460
 concentration of trichloroacetic acid 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.049
 applied during the procedure. 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.289
 because solutions with a concentration 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:22.600
 greater penetrates deeper into the skin 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:24.280
 although individuals with dark curtis 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.659
 are at high risk of 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.969
 discoloration of the skin 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:30.579
 the average peelings can be used with 

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:33.100
 success in individuals with clear curtis and 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:35.140
 light brunette being one of the most 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.119
 common chemical peels 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.310
 the average peelings are a method of 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:42.039
 treatment to treat the lines 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.799
 moderate to normal 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:47.560
 pigmentation acne scars and blemishes 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:50.439
 The skin is composed of two 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:54.039
 layers known as epidermis and dermis 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:56.319
 and the epidermis or outer layer of the skin 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:58.140
 acts as the main defense of the skin 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:00.640
 against the environment and 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.140
 consequently these layers suffer from 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.049
 most of the damage 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.719
 the dermis or deeper layer is 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:10.050
 responsible for the structure and support of 

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:10.050
 skin 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:17.200
 the dermis composed mainly of 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.200
 connective tissue that is constituted in the 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.090
 most of collagen and fibers 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.370
 gelatin these fibers form a network 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.230
 which provides support structure and 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.209
 elasticity to the skin 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.319
 with time the aging process 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:33.969
 and damage caused by the sun causes a 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.370
 decrease in the amount of collagen and 

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:38.829
 elastin fibers as this 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.739
 fiber network breaks down the skin loses 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:44.439
 elasticity and becomes more flaccid 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:47.049
 together the aging damage caused 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:49.060
 by the sun and other factors contribute 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:51.669
 for the formation of wrinkles and other 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.250
 changes in appearance during a peeling 

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:55.000
 a chemical solution is applied in the 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.340
 face 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.949
 the solution causes trauma or injury to the 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.019
 layers of the skin in general the layer 

00:02:59.949 --> 00:03:05.019
 of the epidermis known as 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:07.419
 stratum corneum can be removed in addition to 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.430
 other parts of the epidermis when 

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:11.620
 higher concentrations of 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.540
 trichloroacetic acid are used 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.479
 treatment can expand to the 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.879
 superior regions of the dermis similar to 

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:21.310
 exfoliation of the skin layers of skin 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:24.459
 will be removed 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.530
 as part of the healing process the 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.229
 increased cell growth and 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:32.079
 production and reorganization of collagen 

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:34.299
 produced layers of new skin and 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:37.500
 healthier than give one face 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:40.599
 rejuvenated more luscious appearance 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.459
 the average peelings can last between 15 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:44.409
 it's 60 minutes 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.959
 few weeks before your procedure 

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:50.859
 it may be necessary to use a product 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:52.810
 Transgenic face containing this acid 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:55.509
 because it is believed that trans acid 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:58.060
 prepare the outer layers of the 

00:03:55.509 --> 00:04:00.219
 skin for the treatment as well as allows 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.189
 that the chemical solution of the peeling 

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:06.040
 evenly absorbed by the skin before 

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:07.870
 from the beginning of your procedure to the 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.609
 treatment will be cleaned 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.159
 usually by using a product of 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:14.409
 Alcohol-based facial cleaning 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:16.539
 how can you feel a sense of 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:19.180
 heating or burning during the 

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:22.180
 a topical or topical anesthetic 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.669
 analgesics will be administered to help 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.160
 feel comfortable and relaxed 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:27.680
 during 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.780
 the procedure a sponge or brush 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.480
 will be used to apply the solution 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.200
 chemistry in individual areas 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.940
 the face 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.010
 the average peelings damage 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.990
 mainly the epidermis 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.340
 however unlike peelings 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.710
 superficial 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.080
 the solution used during an average peel 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.010
 can penetrate the papillary dermis or 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.810
 higher 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:51.380
 the effects of treatment 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:54.190
 are more significant an average peel 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:56.870
 the application of trichloroacetic acid 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:59.060
 causes what is known as flash 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.740
 in which the treatment areas 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.720
 becomes a white 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.510
 the degree of frontin will be used to 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.490
 assess the depth of treatment an 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:08.900
 Since the treatment level desired 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.210
 has been achieved 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.040
 the chemical solution will be removed or 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.980
 neutralized with a 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.540
 different layers of the epidermis 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:20.360
 will be removed in time. 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:22.460
 the healing process triggers the 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.600
 growth that generates new 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.180
 layers of skin 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.730
 furthermore within the deep dermis the 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:31.220
 healing process also stimulates 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:33.590
 collagen production and reorganization 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:35.900
 which improves the structure of the skin 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:38.210
 as the healing progresses 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:40.580
 new Delhi revealed giving face a 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:43.160
 revitalized softer appearance 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:45.290
 immediately after the procedure you 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.780
 can continue to feel some frontin 

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:50.900
 which will disappear in about 30 minutes 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:53.060
 and will be replaced by redness and 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.750
 irritation similar to burns 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:56.390
 Sun 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:58.850
 although bandages are not required 

00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:01.040
 as in any wound it is important 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:03.710
 keep the area wet and protected 

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:06.169
 therefore a protective ointment like 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:08.419
 petroleum jelly can be applied on your face 

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:10.760
 days after the procedure 

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:13.190
 most likely you will notice the 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.500
 outer layers of skin peeling 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:17.540
 several days after treatment 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:20.600
 the new skin begins to appear in 

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:22.790
 approximately one to two weeks 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.710
 As your skin heals, it will 

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:27.290
 more sensitive to sun exposure 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:29.690
 therefore during healing it is 

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:33.740
 extremely important to protect the skin 

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:35.419
 against uv-a and uv-b rays in general. 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:37.240
 effects of a procedure of having 

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:39.069
 medium are more visible than 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:41.770
 a superficial peeling because the 

00:06:39.069 --> 00:06:43.509
 procedure causes more skin damage 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:45.759
 the results of a procedure 

00:06:43.509 --> 00:06:48.520
 peeling can last between six and 

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:49.930
 12 months in order to maintain the results 

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:51.910
 desired 

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:54.819
 you can repeat the procedure at each 

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:57.039
 approximately three to six months 

00:06:54.819 --> 00:06:59.740
 it is important to realize that the appearance of 

00:06:57.039 --> 00:07:02.080
 your skin will continue to change getting older 

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:04.120
 after the treatment of medium skin 

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.880
 however the average peelings are a 

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:09.729
 a fast and effective method to improve 

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:12.840
 tone and texture of your skin restoring 

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:12.840
 look younger
