00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.720
 hello to all you could discover it 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.740
 in preview on caradisiac before 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.900
 the Geneva fair 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:23.820
 now here are the first tests the 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.820
 brand new peugeot 308 sw 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.269
 unsurprisingly this peugeot 308 sw 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.070
 resumes the front of the sedan and 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:44.500
 The main changes therefore concern 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.649
 the profile and on the dimensions of course 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:50.589
 she is 4 meters 58 is 33 cm of 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:52.299
 more than the sedan and 8 cm more than 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:53.769
 the old generation of break 

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:54.940
 this has major consequences for 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:56.469
 level of practical aspects and 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.640
 load volume we will see it all 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:59.829
 on time but we must recognize 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.710
 that overall the vehicle is rather 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:04.689
 very successful and boss line clumsy to 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.710
 the interior of the peugeot 308 sw no 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:07.539
 surprise since we find 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.580
 fully the dashboard of the 

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:11.050
 sedan with its expensive hypocrite system 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.729
 to peugeot the little steering wheel 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.560
 the instrumentation is very readable 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.569
 the tablet that groups all 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.340
 air conditioning multimedia controls 

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:21.340
 radios and navigation for example 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.470
 result very few buttons on the 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.569
 center console and a quality a 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.100
 very nice presentation no 

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:28.929
 habitability problem at the back of 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.130
 the peugeot 308 sw thanks to the increase 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:32.170
 of the abatement 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.970
 it is at the level of the space 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.369
 people but also from the roof guard 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.840
 a presentation a very atmosphere 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.820
 nice especially that she vehicle is 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.680
 with panoramic roof 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.649
 So overall it's almost a no 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.590
 fault remains the chest capacity that 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:49.179
 oscillates between 610 and 1660 liters that's 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.979
 one of the best in the category 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:53.740
 she is just ahead of the honda 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.659
 civic tourer this peugeot 308 sw 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.270
 inaugurates a new range of engines 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:01.929
 gasoline and diesel 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.549
 to help for the it and hp diesels for 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:05.799
 the species that coexist for 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:07.840
 launch with the old engines so 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:10.179
 in the end you have an essence of 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.540
 powers ranging from 110 to 155 horses 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.340
 and a diesel from 92 to 150 horsepower for 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.080
 entrance is today we have the top 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.599
 diesel range namely a blu age of 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.680
 250 horsepower coupled to a mechanical gearbox 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:23.200
 6-speed 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.450
 a very attractive marriage thanks 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.340
 especially at its course of 370 newtons 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.080
 meters that allows to show this 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.970
 to all plans and all 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.130
 engaged reports so we go from one 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.349
 versatility very important 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.790
 more than this 308 sw takes over the 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:38.980
 policy of lightening the sedan 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.230
 less 140 kg compared to the previous 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.910
 generation and we always find 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.620
 very pleasant driving sensations 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.660
 with this little steering wheel that gave a 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.760
 impression of sportiness of dynamism to 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.739
 the car you also have this 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.599
 impression that can be enhanced by 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.120
 the sport pack driver is us who does 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:57.519
 his appearance on the 308 sw that changes 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.470
 first of all the instrumentation that 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:02.560
 reinforced the consistency of the 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.000
 direction increases the liveliness of the 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.910
 accelerator pedal but also 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.530
 charge a little bit of engine noise 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.900
 globally we want that thanks to 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.060
 all this very attractive very dynamic 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.410
 and which clearly asserts itself as one 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.720
 the most dynamic breaks of the 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.370
 category we had been seduced by the 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.280
 peugeot 308 it is the same this 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.750
 sw version which concerns the qualities of 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.489
 the sedan know a very vehicle 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.200
 dynamic a streamlined dashboard 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.549
 very nice to watch a good 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.250
 quality of finishes excellent 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:31.989
 comfort and especially this version sw 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.819
 increases the practicalities it is 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.380
 the livability back the volume of 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:37.420
 loading so it's pretty much a 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.819
 fault and she comes clearly attacked 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.889
 a sw golf especially as the prices 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:44.799
 are almost identical to the German 

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:45.669
 since they are between 22 1350 and 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:49.560
 33000 euros 

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:49.560
 these 900 euros more than the sedan
