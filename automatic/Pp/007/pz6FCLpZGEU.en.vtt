00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
base a ball joint at the top and then

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.609 
base a ball joint at the top and then
there's<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.970> double<00:01:24.540> hinged<00:01:24.720> mechanism<00:01:25.409> with<00:01:25.590> a

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
there's a double hinged mechanism with a

there's a double hinged mechanism with a
moving<00:01:26.159> armor<00:01:26.460> piece<00:01:26.610> in<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.820> middle<00:01:26.909> so<00:01:27.330> all

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
moving armor piece in the middle so all

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.719 
moving armor piece in the middle so all
together<00:01:28.049> you<00:01:28.860> can<00:01:29.009> get<00:01:29.130> some<00:01:29.310> pretty<00:01:29.610> good

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
together you can get some pretty good

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.330 
together you can get some pretty good
range<00:01:30.150> of<00:01:30.299> motion<00:01:30.450> in<00:01:30.869> any<00:01:31.320> direction<00:01:31.470> there's

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
range of motion in any direction there's

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.580 
range of motion in any direction there's
a<00:01:32.400> bit<00:01:32.549> of<00:01:32.579> squeaking<00:01:33.090> going<00:01:33.360> on<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:33.750> don't

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
a bit of squeaking going on I don't

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.260 
a bit of squeaking going on I don't
think<00:01:34.770> it's<00:01:34.860> going<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.040> affect<00:01:35.340> anything<00:01:35.939> but

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
think it's going to affect anything but

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.300 
think it's going to affect anything but
that<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:36.600> just<00:01:36.960> something<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.350> note<00:01:37.530> arms<00:01:38.189> are

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
that is just something to note arms are

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.010 
that is just something to note arms are
fantastic<00:01:38.909> first<00:01:39.119> of<00:01:39.270> all<00:01:39.390> for<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.659> shoulder

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
fantastic first of all for the shoulder

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.719 
fantastic first of all for the shoulder
there's<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.259> ball<00:01:40.740> joint<00:01:40.860> connection<00:01:41.340> here<00:01:41.579> on

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
there's a ball joint connection here on

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:42.980 
there's a ball joint connection here on
this<00:01:41.880> side<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.119> then<00:01:42.390> there's<00:01:42.540> another<00:01:42.630> ball

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
this side and then there's another ball

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.569 
this side and then there's another ball
joint<00:01:43.200> connection<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.100> torso<00:01:44.280> so

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
joint connection to the torso so

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.609 
joint connection to the torso so
together<00:01:44.759> these<00:01:45.720> can<00:01:45.930> actually<00:01:46.049> move<00:01:46.409> and

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
together these can actually move and

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.859 
together these can actually move and
give<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.250> great<00:01:47.700> range<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.360> motion<00:01:48.420> for

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
give you a great range of motion for

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.310 
give you a great range of motion for
that<00:01:49.049> shoulder<00:01:49.259> joint<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:50.930> shoulder<00:01:51.930> pad<00:01:52.110> is

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
that shoulder joint the shoulder pad is

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.440 
that shoulder joint the shoulder pad is
independent<00:01:53.070> on<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.549> separate<00:01:54.030> hinge<00:01:54.240> and

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
independent on the separate hinge and

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.539 
independent on the separate hinge and
then<00:01:55.079> of<00:01:55.229> course<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.770> actual<00:01:55.890> arm<00:01:56.310> can<00:01:56.520> move

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
then of course the actual arm can move

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.490 
then of course the actual arm can move
outwards<00:01:56.969> there's<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.479> bicep<00:01:57.960> swivel<00:01:58.350> a

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
outwards there's a bicep swivel a

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.859 
outwards there's a bicep swivel a
double-jointed<00:01:59.280> elbow<00:01:59.759> and<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.270> ball<00:02:00.509> jointed

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
double-jointed elbow and a ball jointed

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.719 
double-jointed elbow and a ball jointed
wrist<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.860> legs<00:02:02.040> are<00:02:02.189> beyond<00:02:02.460> fantastic

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
wrist the legs are beyond fantastic

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.819 
wrist the legs are beyond fantastic
first<00:02:03.360> of<00:02:03.479> all<00:02:03.630> being<00:02:04.229> like<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.649> hips

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
first of all being like the hips

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.499 
first of all being like the hips
themselves<00:02:05.310> they<00:02:05.430> are<00:02:05.460> connected<00:02:06.030> on<00:02:06.119> a<00:02:06.149> ball

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
themselves they are connected on a ball

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.119 
themselves they are connected on a ball
jointed<00:02:06.810> stem<00:02:07.110> so<00:02:07.229> it<00:02:07.320> goes<00:02:07.469> up<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:07.740> down<00:02:07.799> and

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
jointed stem so it goes up and down and

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.440 
jointed stem so it goes up and down and
then<00:02:08.280> that<00:02:08.459> you<00:02:08.550> can<00:02:08.670> tell<00:02:08.910> that<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.239> top

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
then that you can tell that the top

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.809 
then that you can tell that the top
section<00:02:09.840> is<00:02:10.020> just<00:02:10.649> this<00:02:10.739> open<00:02:11.009> cut<00:02:11.400> there<00:02:11.580> so

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
section is just this open cut there so

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.760 
section is just this open cut there so
what<00:02:12.360> that<00:02:12.510> means<00:02:12.690> is<00:02:12.900> not<00:02:13.050> only<00:02:13.200> can<00:02:13.410> you<00:02:13.470> kick

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
what that means is not only can you kick

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.100 
what that means is not only can you kick
forward<00:02:14.100> he<00:02:14.280> can<00:02:14.430> kick<00:02:14.640> right<00:02:15.090> up<00:02:15.270> and<00:02:15.540> then<00:02:15.990> he

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
forward he can kick right up and then he

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.410 
forward he can kick right up and then he
can<00:02:16.230> kick<00:02:16.410> right<00:02:16.650> out<00:02:16.830> going<00:02:17.730> backwards<00:02:18.300> is

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
can kick right out going backwards is

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.810 
can kick right out going backwards is
pretty<00:02:18.630> good<00:02:18.780> too<00:02:18.930> because<00:02:19.110> these<00:02:19.800> pieces<00:02:20.160> can

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
pretty good too because these pieces can

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.160 
pretty good too because these pieces can
move<00:02:21.060> out<00:02:21.330> of<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.540> way<00:02:21.690> so<00:02:21.750> we<00:02:21.930> can<00:02:22.080> go<00:02:22.140> right

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
move out of the way so we can go right

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.760 
move out of the way so we can go right
back

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770
