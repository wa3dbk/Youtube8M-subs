00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:27.260
 71 percent of the surface of our planet 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.599
 takes a woman 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:34.520
 the force of attraction of the moon and the sun result in 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:38.360
 movement of the sea and oceans so on earth 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:43.110
 ebb and flow occur 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:49.550
 tidal energy is used to 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:49.550
 work tidal power do not bother 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:57.770
 crates 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:01.500
 they ate me all well I could hear them 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:07.100
 power tides 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:08.310
 I have a report at school why this 5 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.509
 extreme 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.789
 yes I reiner deftly train to flight 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:19.649
 to the stars and figs come to me 

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:24.110
 they freeze you who will come out first 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:24.110
 here the mayor buys outside 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:32.150
 practice fix the plate and fly 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:36.770
 on a visit to meow you constellation Pleiad 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.770
 a distance of 400 40 light years and 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:02:28.410
 I'll tell you where the tide will be 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.410
 water arrives 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.959
 feel let's help 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.620
 if a 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.920
 after all where 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:03:00.850
 back home and then come on quickly 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:18.440
 Well, my feet got wet and the key is a little remote 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:20.290
 not broke not accidentally thought to run 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:26.530
 systems 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:30.730
 additional energy energy is an idea 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:34.450
 ebb and power limits 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.450
 use a generator or 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.750
 ready 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:09.750
 emergency payments 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:26.280
 now festina 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.280
 armik 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.180
 what happened 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:18.850
 hello without me so urgently need to wipe 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:22.600
 floor and then the neighbors flood again lost 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:25.440
 here's the first one escaped from the fridge and for 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.440
 frozen 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:37.030
 take the wall behind the chase 

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:39.460
 but we will not give up but something urgent 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:44.340
 need to come up with . 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:44.340
 to defeat it 

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:47.490
 answer me 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:51.569
 fly 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:53.550
 mine in front of her and go jamb 

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:58.080
 fly and there friends 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:06:00.530
 Nobody knows children as an office 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.530
 nova 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.590
 and 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.300
 and only 

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:15.059
 my question is for this part 

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:18.400
 there is almost everything and you give 

00:06:15.059 --> 00:06:20.249
 but what else is not yet 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.810
 the stars will fly 

00:06:20.249 --> 00:06:25.940
 This is museum 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:27.490
 nobody knows how and 

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:30.120
 Yes 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:30.120
 Where
