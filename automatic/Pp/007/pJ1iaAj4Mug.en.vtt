like<00:03:16.100> about<00:03:16.130> this<00:03:16.519> well<00:03:16.700> I<00:03:16.730> think<00:03:16.790> the<00:03:17.000> color

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
like about this well I think the color

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:18.910 
like about this well I think the color
is<00:03:17.360> pretty<00:03:17.630> that<00:03:17.900> syndrome<00:03:18.260> that<00:03:18.440> I<00:03:18.590> run<00:03:18.799> into

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
is pretty that syndrome that I run into

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.100 
is pretty that syndrome that I run into
with<00:03:19.160> any<00:03:19.340> sparkly<00:03:19.850> lip<00:03:20.060> color<00:03:20.299> the<00:03:20.810> color

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
with any sparkly lip color the color

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.680 
with any sparkly lip color the color
wears<00:03:21.470> off<00:03:21.769> and<00:03:22.070> then<00:03:22.640> you're<00:03:22.850> left<00:03:23.180> with<00:03:23.480> just

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
wears off and then you're left with just

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.110 
wears off and then you're left with just
the<00:03:24.320> look<00:03:24.500> of<00:03:24.650> like<00:03:24.829> bear<00:03:25.160> lips<00:03:25.489> with<00:03:25.790> glitter

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
the look of like bear lips with glitter

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.180 
the look of like bear lips with glitter
on<00:03:26.329> them<00:03:26.600> I'm<00:03:26.780> not<00:03:27.049> a<00:03:27.109> huge<00:03:27.410> fan<00:03:27.440> of<00:03:27.680> that<00:03:27.950> I

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
on them I'm not a huge fan of that I

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:29.650 
on them I'm not a huge fan of that I
mean<00:03:28.220> otherwise<00:03:28.730> if<00:03:29.120> you<00:03:29.209> can<00:03:29.329> keep<00:03:29.450> this

touched<00:03:29.989> up<00:03:30.260> at<00:03:30.410> all<00:03:30.560> times<00:03:30.859> I<00:03:31.070> think<00:03:31.130> it's<00:03:31.340> a

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
touched up at all times I think it's a

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.580 
touched up at all times I think it's a
pretty<00:03:31.640> shade<00:03:32.060> but<00:03:32.720> once<00:03:32.959> it<00:03:33.109> starts<00:03:33.350> to<00:03:33.410> wear

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
pretty shade but once it starts to wear

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.650 
pretty shade but once it starts to wear
off<00:03:33.650> it's<00:03:34.070> like<00:03:34.310> the<00:03:34.459> glitter<00:03:34.730> is<00:03:34.910> so<00:03:35.150> obvious

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
off it's like the glitter is so obvious

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.630 
off it's like the glitter is so obvious
on<00:03:35.870> your<00:03:36.019> lips<00:03:36.260> and<00:03:36.530> then<00:03:36.680> enticing<00:03:37.280> I<00:03:37.430> think

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
on your lips and then enticing I think

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.190 
on your lips and then enticing I think
is<00:03:37.730> pretty<00:03:38.060> I<00:03:38.120> mean<00:03:38.329> it<00:03:38.420> just<00:03:38.540> comes<00:03:38.720> off<00:03:38.930> like

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
is pretty I mean it just comes off like

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.080 
is pretty I mean it just comes off like
a<00:03:39.230> shiny<00:03:39.650> red<00:03:40.040> I<00:03:40.070> think<00:03:40.459> it's<00:03:40.549> a<00:03:40.640> wearable

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
a shiny red I think it's a wearable

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.120 
a shiny red I think it's a wearable
pretty<00:03:41.570> red<00:03:41.930> I<00:03:42.200> don't<00:03:42.440> find<00:03:42.650> the<00:03:42.799> staying

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
power on this to be as good as it is for

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.069
