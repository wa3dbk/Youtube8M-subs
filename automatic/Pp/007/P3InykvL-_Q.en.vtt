00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
picture on the wall of the school how

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.920 
picture on the wall of the school how
does<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.100> have<00:00:59.309> been<00:00:59.489> moved<00:00:59.730> not<00:01:00.600> with<00:01:00.840> the

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
does that have been moved not with the

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:08.200 
does that have been moved not with the
foot<00:01:04.339> never<00:01:05.339> hand<00:01:05.790> I<00:01:06.030> think<00:01:06.240> we<00:01:06.330> can<00:01:06.450> assume

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
foot never hand I think we can assume

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.510 
foot never hand I think we can assume
like<00:01:09.210> this<00:01:09.450> I<00:01:09.720> say<00:01:10.500> also<00:01:10.799> that<00:01:11.070> would<00:01:11.369> be

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
like this I say also that would be

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.300 
like this I say also that would be
ridiculous<00:01:12.380> so<00:01:13.380> I<00:01:13.409> think<00:01:13.560> we<00:01:13.740> can<00:01:13.830> assume<00:01:13.950> he

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
ridiculous so I think we can assume he

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.910 
ridiculous so I think we can assume he
must<00:01:14.490> be<00:01:14.580> at<00:01:14.760> least<00:01:14.909> eight<00:01:15.270> foot<00:01:15.540> tall<00:01:18.920> like
