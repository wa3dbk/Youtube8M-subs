00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.940
 I have four books but there are currently 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:17.030
 two you can find in the 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.980
 bookstores in airports and they are in 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:23.330

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:29.120
 short exposure time libraries 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:32.300
 With exceptions, most of those who 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:34.450
 we write and they publish us we are in 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.780
 our books are in bookstores 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:40.730
 approximately three months sometimes less 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.530
 and of course if you go to the bookstore and 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.210
 you ask and they do not have it they are going to 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.610

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:35.000

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:44.030
 a book that, fortunately, is 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:46.190
 is liking a lot I have received a lot 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:50.479
 feedback on this by 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:53.860
 example I read the chapters if he talks about 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:56.950
 how to develop our potential 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:59.950
 the importance of reliving dreams all 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.440
 is based on universal principles not 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.240
 they're just pretty words really 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.730
 there is a background behind this but with the 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.649
 practical application how to live with 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:12.550
 free attitude maybe this is the subject 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:16.120
 what I like the most is proactivity to the 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.590
 Latin way there is really an example 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.950
 there that managed to be converted into 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.470

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:32.140
 humility and what is the right humility 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:35.260
 dare to discard how we can 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.760
 advance grow by leaving things that we 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.849
 they are currently holding back 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.890
 the importance of giving is better to give than 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:46.560

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.630

 chapters this book is based on a 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.840
 research and it gives us a methodology 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.450
 to change habits in a way 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.030

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:56.930
 possible to generate them at any age and 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.330
 why humans generate 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.970

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:05.060

 how we can change habits is a 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:18.260
 four-step based model based on 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:21.290
