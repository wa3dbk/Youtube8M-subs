just<00:02:13.180> have<00:02:13.270> to<00:02:13.390> make<00:02:13.540> sure<00:02:13.750> it<00:02:13.810> goes

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.420 

now

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.580 

we've<00:02:49.430> been<00:02:49.610> sitting<00:02:49.849> here<00:02:49.940> probably<00:02:50.590> 20

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
we've been sitting here probably 20

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.250 
we've been sitting here probably 20
minutes<00:02:51.620> and<00:02:52.340> I<00:02:52.970> still<00:02:53.030> have<00:02:53.330> this<00:02:53.840> much<00:02:54.049> left

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
minutes and I still have this much left

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.410 
minutes and I still have this much left
in<00:02:54.379> my<00:02:54.470> bottle<00:02:54.799> like<00:02:55.580> I<00:02:55.700> said<00:02:55.940> if<00:02:56.120> we<00:02:56.239> go<00:02:56.360> too

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
in my bottle like I said if we go too

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:57.820 
in my bottle like I said if we go too
fast<00:02:56.750> I'll<00:02:57.080> go<00:02:57.170> straight<00:02:57.379> to<00:02:57.500> her<00:02:57.590> heart<00:02:57.709> and

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
fast I'll go straight to her heart and

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.890 
fast I'll go straight to her heart and
kill<00:02:58.069> her<00:02:58.190> so<00:02:58.760> it's<00:02:59.030> really<00:02:59.209> really<00:02:59.510> important

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
kill her so it's really really important

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.960 
kill her so it's really really important
that<00:02:59.930> I<00:03:00.080> take<00:03:00.349> my<00:03:00.379> time<00:03:00.530> and<00:03:00.890> give<00:03:01.670> this<00:03:01.790> to<00:03:01.909> a

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
that I take my time and give this to a

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.910 
that I take my time and give this to a
really<00:03:02.180> slow<00:03:02.390> she<00:03:03.140> kind<00:03:03.440> of<00:03:03.530> moved<00:03:03.680> a<00:03:03.799> little

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
really slow she kind of moved a little

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.580 
really slow she kind of moved a little
bit<00:03:04.090> how<00:03:05.090> this<00:03:05.390> stuff<00:03:05.599> works<00:03:05.660> right<00:03:06.049> away<00:03:06.230> when

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
bit how this stuff works right away when

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.350 
bit how this stuff works right away when
it<00:03:06.680> works<00:03:06.830> it's<00:03:07.010> amazing<00:03:07.459> she<00:03:08.000> kind<00:03:08.180> of<00:03:08.239> moved

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
it works it's amazing she kind of moved

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.759 
it works it's amazing she kind of moved
a<00:03:08.510> little<00:03:08.599> bit<00:03:08.750> but<00:03:09.019> now<00:03:09.110> she's<00:03:09.349> still<00:03:09.560> sitting

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
a little bit but now she's still sitting

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:11.680 
a little bit but now she's still sitting
so<00:03:10.129> I'm<00:03:10.610> guessing<00:03:11.000> I'll<00:03:11.090> probably<00:03:11.330> have<00:03:11.510> to<00:03:11.569> go

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
so I'm guessing I'll probably have to go

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.539 
so I'm guessing I'll probably have to go
get<00:03:11.810> her<00:03:11.900> another<00:03:12.049> bottle<00:03:12.440> I<00:03:15.220> have<00:03:16.220> my<00:03:16.340> first

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
get her another bottle I have my first

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:18.039 
get her another bottle I have my first
bottle<00:03:16.760> of<00:03:16.849> gun<00:03:17.030> I'm<00:03:17.269> gonna<00:03:17.390> wait<00:03:17.540> probably<00:03:17.720> 10

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
bottle of gun I'm gonna wait probably 10

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:19.930 
bottle of gun I'm gonna wait probably 10
minutes<00:03:18.200> and<00:03:18.560> bring<00:03:18.799> another<00:03:18.890> bottle<00:03:19.159> but<00:03:19.910> I

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
minutes and bring another bottle but I

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.809 
minutes and bring another bottle but I
would<00:03:20.209> say<00:03:20.360> she<00:03:20.629> already<00:03:20.959> looks<00:03:21.200> more<00:03:21.530> alert

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
would say she already looks more alert

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:27.750 
would say she already looks more alert
so<00:03:23.200> hopefully<00:03:24.200> she'll<00:03:24.739> be<00:03:24.769> up<00:03:24.920> here<00:03:25.099> shortly

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.759 

well<00:03:28.760> I<00:03:28.790> came<00:03:29.060> back<00:03:29.450> to<00:03:29.840> check<00:03:30.109> on<00:03:30.230> my<00:03:30.410> counts

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
well I came back to check on my counts

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:33.280 
well I came back to check on my counts
but<00:03:30.890> about<00:03:31.010> 15<00:03:31.459> minutes<00:03:31.730> and<00:03:32.569> see<00:03:33.019> if<00:03:33.109> she

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
but about 15 minutes and see if she

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.809 
but about 15 minutes and see if she
needed<00:03:33.560> more<00:03:34.030> um<00:03:35.530> calcium<00:03:36.530> and<00:03:37.220> here<00:03:37.670> she

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:37.819 
needed more um calcium and here she

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:41.080 
needed more um calcium and here she
stands<00:03:38.560> so<00:03:39.560> it's<00:03:40.040> amazing<00:03:40.459> how<00:03:40.609> fast<00:03:40.819> that

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
stands so it's amazing how fast that

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.270 
stands so it's amazing how fast that
stuff<00:03:41.329> works<00:03:41.540> and<00:03:41.870> I'm<00:03:42.650> glad<00:03:42.829> to<00:03:42.950> see<00:03:43.099> she's

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
stuff works and I'm glad to see she's

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.589 
stuff works and I'm glad to see she's
doing<00:03:43.310> all<00:03:43.640> right<00:03:43.670> she's<00:03:43.910> still<00:03:44.150> shaking<00:03:44.540> a

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:44.599 
doing all right she's still shaking a

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.750 
doing all right she's still shaking a
little<00:03:44.890> you<00:03:45.890> can<00:03:46.040> see<00:03:46.190> that<00:03:46.340> I'll<00:03:46.519> probably

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
little you can see that I'll probably

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.520 
little you can see that I'll probably
give<00:03:47.030> her<00:03:47.150> some<00:03:49.510> oral<00:03:50.510> calcium<00:03:51.019> I<00:03:51.140> take<00:03:51.410> her

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:52.690 
give her some oral calcium I take her
home<00:03:51.709> but<00:03:51.980> I'm<00:03:52.069> definitely<00:03:52.220> going<00:03:52.489> to<00:03:52.579> wait<00:03:52.669> a

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
home but I'm definitely going to wait a

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.120 
home but I'm definitely going to wait a
few<00:03:52.880> hours<00:03:52.940> to<00:03:53.450> put<00:03:54.200> on<00:03:54.290> a<00:03:54.319> trailer<00:03:54.769> anything

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
few hours to put on a trailer anything

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.180 
few hours to put on a trailer anything
make<00:03:55.310> sure<00:03:55.340> she's<00:03:55.730> doing<00:03:55.910> all<00:03:56.150> right
