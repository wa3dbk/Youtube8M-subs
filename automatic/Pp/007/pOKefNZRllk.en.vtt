your your your mate your mating surfaces
are<00:02:27.510> clean<00:02:28.310> when<00:02:29.310> you<00:02:29.459> put<00:02:29.670> that<00:02:29.820> on<00:02:30.030> there

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
are clean when you put that on there

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:34.520 
are clean when you put that on there
okay<00:02:32.299> and<00:02:33.299> this<00:02:33.540> is<00:02:33.600> the<00:02:33.780> piece<00:02:34.140> that<00:02:34.170> holds

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
okay and this is the piece that holds

your your file and whatnot on you put
that<00:02:37.650> on<00:02:37.830> there<00:02:38.010> let's<00:02:38.160> get<00:02:38.340> rid<00:02:38.549> of<00:02:38.580> the

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
that on there let's get rid of the

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.870 
that on there let's get rid of the
two-degree<00:02:38.970> plate<00:02:39.769> we<00:02:40.769> don't<00:02:40.950> need<00:02:41.130> that<00:02:41.340> now

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
two-degree plate we don't need that now

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.240 
two-degree plate we don't need that now
okay<00:02:42.450> this<00:02:42.959> is<00:02:43.019> a<00:02:43.200> brand<00:02:43.470> new<00:02:43.560> pair<00:02:43.890> of<00:02:44.010> skis

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
okay this is a brand new pair of skis

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.400 
okay this is a brand new pair of skis
now<00:02:44.459> I<00:02:44.489> have<00:02:44.730> this<00:02:44.880> bit<00:02:45.150> if<00:02:45.600> this<00:02:45.810> is<00:02:45.989> a<00:02:46.019> used

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
now I have this bit if this is a used

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.289 
now I have this bit if this is a used
pair<00:02:46.709> of<00:02:46.860> skis<00:02:47.130> that's<00:02:47.519> had<00:02:47.670> a<00:02:47.700> lot<00:02:47.970> of<00:02:48.000> work

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
pair of skis that's had a lot of work

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:50.240 
pair of skis that's had a lot of work
hardening<00:02:48.810> or<00:02:49.019> hit<00:02:49.170> a<00:02:49.200> lot<00:02:49.410> of<00:02:49.440> rocks<00:02:49.769> in<00:02:50.070> any

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
hardening or hit a lot of rocks in any

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.940 
hardening or hit a lot of rocks in any
way<00:02:50.400> had<00:02:51.000> damage<00:02:51.930> to<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.230> edge<00:02:52.350> you<00:02:52.380> probably

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
way had damage to the edge you probably

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.130 
way had damage to the edge you probably
heard<00:02:53.070> people<00:02:53.100> say<00:02:53.549> before<00:02:53.700> that<00:02:54.570> makes<00:02:54.870> this

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
heard people say before that makes this

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.920 
heard people say before that makes this
that<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.920> edge<00:02:56.130> very<00:02:56.670> hard<00:02:57.090> and<00:02:57.480> it<00:02:57.570> makes<00:02:57.780> it

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
that the edge very hard and it makes it

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.900 
that the edge very hard and it makes it
hard<00:02:58.140> to<00:02:58.350> get<00:02:58.470> through<00:02:58.680> and<00:02:59.010> even<00:02:59.580> some<00:02:59.790> of

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
hard to get through and even some of

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.699 
hard to get through and even some of
this<00:03:00.000> machine<00:03:00.450> tenon<00:03:00.840> you'll<00:03:01.020> see<00:03:01.230> on<00:03:01.380> the<00:03:01.470> ski

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
this machine tenon you'll see on the ski

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.230 
this machine tenon you'll see on the ski
sometimes<00:03:02.250> could<00:03:02.459> make<00:03:02.610> that<00:03:02.790> edge

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
sometimes could make that edge

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.140 
sometimes could make that edge
hard<00:03:03.720> hard<00:03:04.530> to<00:03:04.680> get<00:03:04.920> a<00:03:04.950> file<00:03:05.250> into<00:03:05.760> it<00:03:05.880> to<00:03:06.000> get

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
hard hard to get a file into it to get

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.490 
hard hard to get a file into it to get
to<00:03:06.510> get<00:03:06.690> it<00:03:06.810> to<00:03:06.900> work

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
to get it to work

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.700 
to get it to work
so<00:03:07.920> in<00:03:08.130> that<00:03:08.310> case<00:03:08.610> if<00:03:09.570> it<00:03:09.750> was<00:03:09.900> not<00:03:10.110> a<00:03:10.140> new<00:03:10.440> ski

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710 
so in that case if it was not a new ski

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.070 
so in that case if it was not a new ski
okay<00:03:10.980> I'm<00:03:11.040> just<00:03:11.220> going<00:03:11.370> to<00:03:11.460> tell<00:03:11.610> you<00:03:11.870> if<00:03:12.870> it

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
okay I'm just going to tell you if it

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.070 
okay I'm just going to tell you if it
was<00:03:13.110> an<00:03:13.320> old<00:03:13.470> rocked-out<00:03:13.830> ski<00:03:14.460> that<00:03:15.060> and<00:03:15.870> I

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
was an old rocked-out ski that and I

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.080 
was an old rocked-out ski that and I
wanted<00:03:16.440> to<00:03:16.560> refile<00:03:17.160> this<00:03:17.400> edge<00:03:17.580> the<00:03:17.820> first

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
wanted to refile this edge the first

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.640 
wanted to refile this edge the first
thing<00:03:18.330> I<00:03:18.420> would<00:03:18.480> actually<00:03:18.750> do<00:03:19.140> is<00:03:19.260> I<00:03:19.380> wouldn't

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
thing I would actually do is I wouldn't

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.460 
thing I would actually do is I wouldn't
use<00:03:20.010> a<00:03:20.040> file<00:03:20.340> at<00:03:20.520> all<00:03:20.670> these<00:03:21.630> are<00:03:21.870> diamond

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
use a file at all these are diamond

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.200 
use a file at all these are diamond
stones<00:03:22.770> and<00:03:23.100> these<00:03:23.490> are<00:03:23.700> course<00:03:24.050> this<00:03:25.050> is<00:03:25.200> a

120 grit beast stone diamond stone and

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.430 
120 grit beast stone diamond stone and
this<00:03:31.800> is<00:03:31.950> a<00:03:31.980> loon<00:03:32.340> flex<00:03:32.670> and<00:03:33.030> this<00:03:33.870> is<00:03:34.020> a<00:03:34.050> moon

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
this is a loon flex and this is a moon

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
this is a loon flex and this is a moon
flex<00:03:34.800> 100<00:03:35.580> 100<00:03:36.510> grit<00:03:37.260> diamond<00:03:37.740> stone<00:03:37.980> now<00:03:38.220> for

flex 100 100 grit diamond stone now for

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.370 
flex 100 100 grit diamond stone now for
the<00:03:38.550> diamond<00:03:39.150> is<00:03:39.270> super<00:03:39.600> hard<00:03:39.780> it'll<00:03:40.110> cut

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
the diamond is super hard it'll cut

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.980 
the diamond is super hard it'll cut
through<00:03:40.410> those<00:03:40.830> hard<00:03:41.090> pieces<00:03:42.090> of<00:03:42.450> metal<00:03:42.840> that

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:42.990 
through those hard pieces of metal that

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:44.690 
through those hard pieces of metal that
are<00:03:43.050> stopping<00:03:43.620> your<00:03:43.740> file<00:03:43.980> from<00:03:44.250> cutting

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
are stopping your file from cutting

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.180 
are stopping your file from cutting
through<00:03:44.910> into<00:03:45.210> that<00:03:45.390> metal<00:03:45.690> and<00:03:46.530> you'd<00:03:46.950> work

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
through into that metal and you'd work

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.490 
through into that metal and you'd work
it<00:03:47.220> over<00:03:47.610> pretty<00:03:47.850> hard<00:03:48.150> with<00:03:48.390> these<00:03:48.660> stones<00:03:49.110> on

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
it over pretty hard with these stones on

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.380 
it over pretty hard with these stones on
an<00:03:49.620> old<00:03:49.800> ski<00:03:50.160> before<00:03:50.550> you'd<00:03:50.700> even<00:03:50.820> start<00:03:51.240> to

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
an old ski before you'd even start to

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.750 
an old ski before you'd even start to
file<00:03:51.600> in<00:03:52.320> this<00:03:52.470> case<00:03:52.710> this<00:03:52.950> skis<00:03:53.250> never<00:03:53.490> been

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
file in this case this skis never been

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:54.290 
file in this case this skis never been
used

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
used

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.290 
used
if<00:03:54.540> the<00:03:54.780> tune<00:03:55.020> is<00:03:55.170> atrocious<00:03:56.120> but<00:03:57.120> it

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
if the tune is atrocious but it

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.210 
if the tune is atrocious but it
shouldn't<00:03:57.630> have<00:03:57.810> any<00:03:57.960> real<00:03:58.230> hard<00:03:58.560> spots<00:03:58.980> so

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
shouldn't have any real hard spots so

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:06.550 
shouldn't have any real hard spots so
I'm<00:03:59.310> just<00:03:59.610> going<00:03:59.790> to<00:03:59.850> start<00:04:00.150> with<00:04:00.300> a<00:04:00.330> file<00:04:00.690> here

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.590 

okay<00:04:07.560> so<00:04:07.620> a<00:04:08.040> couple<00:04:08.760> different<00:04:08.940> kind<00:04:09.300> of<00:04:09.390> files

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
okay so a couple different kind of files

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.270 
okay so a couple different kind of files
this<00:04:09.870> is<00:04:10.020> a<00:04:10.050> B<00:04:10.350> state<00:04:10.680> mil<00:04:11.900> a<00:04:12.900> little<00:04:13.770> coarser

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
this is a B state mil a little coarser

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.810 
this is a B state mil a little coarser
it's<00:04:15.000> a<00:04:15.060> little<00:04:15.300> coarser<00:04:15.810> file<00:04:16.109> to<00:04:16.560> let<00:04:16.820> you

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
it's a little coarser file to let you

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.880 
it's a little coarser file to let you
know<00:04:17.940> cut<00:04:18.420> cut<00:04:18.870> a<00:04:18.900> significant<00:04:19.620> amount<00:04:19.770> of

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
know cut cut a significant amount of

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:21.770 
know cut cut a significant amount of
edge<00:04:20.070> and<00:04:20.400> pretty<00:04:20.730> quick<00:04:20.910> time<00:04:21.239> and<00:04:21.450> not<00:04:21.540> sit

okay so we put the file in the guy I'm
not<00:04:48.810> going<00:04:49.200> to<00:04:49.290> all<00:04:49.350> get<00:04:49.590> technical<00:04:49.980> about<00:04:50.220> how

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
not going to all get technical about how

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.880 
not going to all get technical about how
this<00:04:50.850> works<00:04:51.150> not<00:04:51.780> selling<00:04:52.200> this<00:04:52.350> equipment

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890 
this works not selling this equipment

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:55.610 
this works not selling this equipment
but<00:04:53.880> if<00:04:54.060> you<00:04:54.210> put<00:04:54.450> your<00:04:54.570> files<00:04:54.840> in<00:04:55.050> the<00:04:55.140> garden

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
but if you put your files in the garden

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.280 
but if you put your files in the garden
backwards<00:04:56.190> yeah<00:04:57.090> you<00:04:57.450> should<00:04:57.690> figure<00:04:57.930> it<00:04:58.050> out

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290 
backwards yeah you should figure it out

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:59.660 
backwards yeah you should figure it out
pretty<00:04:58.560> quick<00:04:58.890> because<00:04:59.010> it's<00:04:59.250> not<00:04:59.400> going<00:04:59.580> to

00:04:59.660 --> 00:04:59.670 
pretty quick because it's not going to

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:02.630 
pretty quick because it's not going to
cut<00:04:59.850> anything<00:05:00.150> so<00:05:00.600> I'm<00:05:01.440> putting<00:05:01.980> my<00:05:02.010> file<00:05:02.370> in

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:02.640 
cut anything so I'm putting my file in

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:07.580 
cut anything so I'm putting my file in
the<00:05:02.760> guide<00:05:05.210> I'm<00:05:06.210> tightening<00:05:06.690> it<00:05:06.930> down<00:05:07.170> really

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
the guide I'm tightening it down really

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.969 
the guide I'm tightening it down really
good<00:05:07.920> and
