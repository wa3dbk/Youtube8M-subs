far games have become today's

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.569 
far games have become today's
entertainment<00:01:28.499> well<00:01:29.499> I<00:01:29.530> mean<00:01:29.770> now<00:01:30.009> more<00:01:30.460> than

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:30.579 
entertainment well I mean now more than

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:32.039 
entertainment well I mean now more than
ever<00:01:30.700> I<00:01:30.789> mean<00:01:30.969> just<00:01:31.179> shooting<00:01:31.509> this<00:01:31.659> it's<00:01:31.929> like

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.049 
ever I mean just shooting this it's like

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:34.560 
ever I mean just shooting this it's like
a<00:01:32.079> movie<00:01:32.499> so<00:01:32.859> that<00:01:33.520> I<00:01:33.820> don't<00:01:33.939> think<00:01:34.179> a<00:01:34.270> video

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
a movie so that I don't think a video

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.419 
a movie so that I don't think a video
game<00:01:34.749> has<00:01:34.899> ever<00:01:35.109> provided<00:01:35.429> entertainment

00:01:36.419 --> 00:01:36.429 
game has ever provided entertainment

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:39.330 
game has ever provided entertainment
value<00:01:36.670> and<00:01:36.700> as<00:01:37.270> like<00:01:37.780> a<00:01:37.810> movie<00:01:38.170> I<00:01:38.619> think<00:01:39.070> it's

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
value and as like a movie I think it's

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.959 
value and as like a movie I think it's
more<00:01:39.520> of<00:01:39.640> a<00:01:39.729> game<00:01:40.179> play<00:01:40.719> than<00:01:41.969> entertainment

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:42.969 
more of a game play than entertainment

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:44.160 
more of a game play than entertainment
and<00:01:43.090> I<00:01:43.119> think<00:01:43.299> now<00:01:43.450> I<00:01:43.479> mean<00:01:43.929> with<00:01:44.049> these

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
and I think now I mean with these

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.539 
and I think now I mean with these
cinematics<00:01:44.710> at<00:01:44.859> least<00:01:44.979> that<00:01:45.130> we're<00:01:45.219> doing<00:01:45.310> for

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 
cinematics at least that we're doing for

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:47.819 
cinematics at least that we're doing for
Halo<00:01:45.850> it's<00:01:46.600> you<00:01:46.990> take<00:01:47.170> all<00:01:47.289> the<00:01:47.380> cinematics

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:47.829 
Halo it's you take all the cinematics

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:49.440 
Halo it's you take all the cinematics
back-to-back<00:01:48.249> you<00:01:48.429> could<00:01:48.579> make<00:01:48.789> a<00:01:48.819> movie<00:01:49.179> so<00:01:49.420> I

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
back-to-back you could make a movie so I

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.539 
back-to-back you could make a movie so I
think<00:01:49.569> that<00:01:49.899> that's<00:01:50.079> it's<00:01:50.740> huge<00:01:50.979> it's<00:01:51.189> never<00:01:51.340> I

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549 
think that that's it's huge it's never I

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:53.419 
think that that's it's huge it's never I
mean<00:01:51.700> I<00:01:51.729> don't<00:01:51.819> remember<00:01:51.939> a<00:01:52.149> storyline<00:01:52.780> and

00:01:53.419 --> 00:01:53.429 
mean I don't remember a storyline and

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:55.859 
mean I don't remember a storyline and
Super<00:01:54.429> Mario<00:01:54.609> Brothers<00:01:54.939> I<00:01:55.179> mean<00:01:55.359> like<00:01:55.450> Zelda

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
Super Mario Brothers I mean like Zelda

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:57.239 
Super Mario Brothers I mean like Zelda
was<00:01:56.020> the<00:01:56.109> closest<00:01:56.530> but<00:01:56.740> that<00:01:56.859> wasn't<00:01:57.159> even

00:01:57.239 --> 00:01:57.249 
was the closest but that wasn't even

as<00:02:55.160> you<00:02:55.459> were<00:02:55.580> bringing<00:02:55.760> the<00:02:55.910> dialogue<00:02:56.330> to

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
as you were bringing the dialogue to

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.500 
as you were bringing the dialogue to
life<00:02:57.250> well<00:02:58.250> that<00:02:58.430> was<00:02:58.580> another<00:02:58.910> I<00:02:59.239> mean<00:02:59.390> the

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
life well that was another I mean the

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.500 
life well that was another I mean the
the<00:03:00.020> closest<00:03:00.680> comparison<00:03:01.520> that<00:03:01.970> I<00:03:02.030> was<00:03:02.360> trying

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
the closest comparison that I was trying

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.090 
the closest comparison that I was trying
to<00:03:02.630> grasp<00:03:02.840> would<00:03:03.110> be<00:03:03.260> like<00:03:03.500> Peter<00:03:03.680> Pan<00:03:03.890> and

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
to grasp would be like Peter Pan and

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.660 
to grasp would be like Peter Pan and
Tinkerbell<00:03:04.459> so<00:03:05.450> it's<00:03:05.630> like<00:03:05.810> you<00:03:06.650> have<00:03:06.680> your

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
Tinkerbell so it's like you have your

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.810 
Tinkerbell so it's like you have your
you<00:03:08.030> have<00:03:08.060> a<00:03:08.209> love<00:03:08.480> for<00:03:08.750> someone<00:03:08.959> that<00:03:09.860> you

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
you have a love for someone that you

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.530 
you have a love for someone that you
just<00:03:11.360> kind<00:03:11.570> of<00:03:11.720> have<00:03:12.110> no<00:03:12.880> way<00:03:13.880> of<00:03:13.910> actually

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
just kind of have no way of actually

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.690 
just kind of have no way of actually
being<00:03:14.690> with<00:03:14.840> them<00:03:15.049> and<00:03:15.590> I<00:03:15.680> think<00:03:15.739> that<00:03:16.040> adds<00:03:16.190> so

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
being with them and I think that adds so

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.460 
being with them and I think that adds so
much<00:03:16.940> dimension<00:03:17.000> and<00:03:17.720> levels<00:03:18.049> to<00:03:18.320> their

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
much dimension and levels to their

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.620 
much dimension and levels to their
relationship<00:03:19.010> that<00:03:19.220> it<00:03:19.910> really<00:03:20.090> comes<00:03:20.360> alive

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
relationship that it really comes alive

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.630 
relationship that it really comes alive
in<00:03:21.080> the<00:03:21.230> in<00:03:21.530> the<00:03:21.620> dialogue<00:03:21.980> but<00:03:22.220> for<00:03:22.400> me<00:03:22.519> it

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
in the in the dialogue but for me it

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.229 
in the in the dialogue but for me it
gave<00:03:22.850> me<00:03:23.090> a<00:03:23.120> lot<00:03:23.360> of<00:03:23.510> background<00:03:24.470> to<00:03:25.130> give<00:03:25.310> to

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
gave me a lot of background to give to

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.750 
gave me a lot of background to give to
bring<00:03:26.450> to<00:03:26.630> her
