00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.880 
so I want to do a quick video for you
about<00:00:02.760> contiki<00:00:03.780> which<00:00:04.170> is<00:00:04.380> an<00:00:04.529> open-source

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
about contiki which is an open-source

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.220 
about contiki which is an open-source
operating<00:00:05.339> system<00:00:06.270> that<00:00:06.450> provides<00:00:06.810> a<00:00:06.960> full

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
operating system that provides a full

operating system that provides a full
application<00:00:07.379> suite<00:00:08.250> and<00:00:08.480> tcp/ip<00:00:09.480> stack<00:00:09.990> the

entire<00:00:11.040> Kentucky<00:00:11.610> package<00:00:12.120> is<00:00:12.300> very<00:00:12.540> small<00:00:12.870> in

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
entire Kentucky package is very small in

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.049 
entire Kentucky package is very small in
size<00:00:13.170> and<00:00:13.530> so<00:00:13.650> it's<00:00:13.799> mostly<00:00:14.130> used<00:00:14.400> on<00:00:14.549> 8-bit

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
size and so it's mostly used on 8-bit

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.960

from<00:03:35.879> 1979<00:03:36.659> I'm<00:03:37.590> using<00:03:37.920> an<00:03:38.159> Ethernet<00:03:38.310> card

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:38.909 
from 1979 I'm using an Ethernet card

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:40.250 
from 1979 I'm using an Ethernet card
right<00:03:39.120> now<00:03:39.269> to<00:03:39.330> connect<00:03:39.780> to<00:03:39.870> my<00:03:40.019> wireless

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
right now to connect to my wireless

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.530 
right now to connect to my wireless
router<00:03:40.590> but<00:03:41.370> I<00:03:41.430> do<00:03:41.549> actually<00:03:41.879> have<00:03:42.209> to<00:03:42.269> have

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
router but I do actually have to have

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.050 
router but I do actually have to have
the<00:03:43.080> physical<00:03:43.260> cable<00:03:43.890> there<00:03:44.129> because

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
the physical cable there because

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.820 
the physical cable there because
wireless<00:03:45.480> capability<00:03:46.080> hasn't<00:03:46.500> yet<00:03:46.620> been

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
wireless capability hasn't yet been

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.920 
wireless capability hasn't yet been
developed<00:03:47.340> for<00:03:47.760> the<00:03:47.879> Apple<00:03:48.150> tube<00:03:48.330> I'm<00:03:48.599> keeping

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
developed for the Apple tube I'm keeping

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.280 
developed for the Apple tube I'm keeping
my<00:03:49.019> fingers<00:03:49.349> crossed<00:03:49.560> that<00:03:50.010> day<00:03:50.730> will<00:03:50.909> come

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
my fingers crossed that day will come

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.000 
my fingers crossed that day will come
alright<00:03:52.290> so<00:03:52.439> there's<00:03:52.620> a<00:03:52.680> few<00:03:52.830> other

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
alright so there's a few other

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.559 
alright so there's a few other
applications<00:03:53.760> that<00:03:53.879> I<00:03:54.000> think<00:03:54.239> are<00:03:54.390> worth

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
applications that I think are worth

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:57.309 
applications that I think are worth
noting<00:03:55.080> like<00:03:55.680> accessing<00:03:56.189> an<00:03:56.459> FTP<00:03:57.000> server

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:57.319 
noting like accessing an FTP server

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:00.800 
noting like accessing an FTP server
ability<00:03:58.319> to<00:03:58.500> download<00:03:58.650> files<00:03:59.220> and<00:03:59.810> email

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
ability to download files and email

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.530 
ability to download files and email
capability<00:04:01.620> although<00:04:02.519> you<00:04:02.580> can<00:04:02.760> only<00:04:02.970> send
