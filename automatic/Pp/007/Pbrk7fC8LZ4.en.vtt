he had on congestive heart failure

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:37.150 
he had on congestive heart failure
we<00:00:35.420> actually<00:00:35.629> saw<00:00:35.989> him<00:00:36.260> three<00:00:36.649> years<00:00:36.920> ago

we actually saw him three years ago

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.400 
we actually saw him three years ago
because<00:00:37.820> there<00:00:38.449> was<00:00:38.629> the<00:00:38.809> thought<00:00:39.050> that<00:00:39.079> he

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
because there was the thought that he

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.500 
because there was the thought that he
may<00:00:39.530> need<00:00:39.679> a<00:00:39.739> heart<00:00:40.010> transplant<00:00:40.249> some<00:00:40.850> day<00:00:41.089> and

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
may need a heart transplant some day and

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.869 
may need a heart transplant some day and
the<00:00:42.409> family<00:00:42.859> was<00:00:43.010> very<00:00:43.159> interested<00:00:43.730> in<00:00:43.820> our

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
blood conservation program it was

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.250 
blood conservation program it was
becoming<00:00:46.309> clearer<00:00:46.760> that<00:00:47.149> transplant<00:00:48.050> was

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
becoming clearer that transplant was

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.689 
becoming clearer that transplant was
imminent

00:00:49.689 --> 00:00:49.699 
imminent

basically<00:02:13.530> went<00:02:13.800> through<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.070> transplant

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
basically went through the transplant

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.950 
basically went through the transplant
very<00:02:15.360> smoothly<00:02:15.750> we<00:02:16.470> have<00:02:16.740> a<00:02:17.510> huge<00:02:18.510> team<00:02:18.780> of
