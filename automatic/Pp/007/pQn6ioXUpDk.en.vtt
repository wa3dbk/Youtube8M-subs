00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
development one of my personal favorites

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.300 
development one of my personal favorites
is<00:02:05.390> the<00:02:06.080> artificial<00:02:06.560> blood<00:02:06.740> that<00:02:07.070> runs

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
is the artificial blood that runs

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.160 
is the artificial blood that runs
through<00:02:07.490> these<00:02:07.820> tubing's<00:02:08.270> but<00:02:08.690> this<00:02:08.840> is<00:02:09.020> not

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
through these tubing's but this is not

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.610 
through these tubing's but this is not
real<00:02:10.010> blood<00:02:10.160> this<00:02:10.429> is<00:02:10.750> nanoparticles<00:02:11.750> and<00:02:12.290> I

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
real blood this is nanoparticles and I

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.230 
real blood this is nanoparticles and I
thought<00:02:12.800> that<00:02:13.040> was<00:02:13.190> absolutely<00:02:13.790> science

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
thought that was absolutely science

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.820 
thought that was absolutely science
fiction<00:02:14.570> so<00:02:14.690> I<00:02:14.720> thought<00:02:14.990> that<00:02:15.260> was<00:02:15.440> very<00:02:15.500> very

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
fiction so I thought that was very very

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:16.449 
fiction so I thought that was very very
impressive

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
impressive

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.520 
impressive
also<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:17.450> fact<00:02:17.690> that<00:02:17.750> they<00:02:17.900> are<00:02:17.959> very<00:02:18.230> close

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530

think<00:02:28.489> of<00:02:28.700> the<00:02:28.850> great<00:02:29.030> benefits<00:02:29.300> some

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
think of the great benefits some

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.310 
think of the great benefits some
technology<00:02:30.290> like<00:02:30.410> that<00:02:30.560> would<00:02:30.680> bring<00:02:32.320> come

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
technology like that would bring come

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.979 
technology like that would bring come

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
with the benefits come some important

setec arm and and I'm wondering it's
interesting<00:03:37.190> it<00:03:37.580> does<00:03:38.000> look<00:03:38.269> like<00:03:38.300> a<00:03:38.480> hand

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
interesting it does look like a hand

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.710 
interesting it does look like a hand
again<00:03:38.959> is<00:03:39.110> very<00:03:39.260> clearly<00:03:39.620> a<00:03:40.480> mechanical<00:03:41.480> hand

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
again is very clearly a mechanical hand

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.770 
again is very clearly a mechanical hand
it<00:03:41.959> is<00:03:42.459> could<00:03:43.459> it<00:03:43.489> look<00:03:43.879> more<00:03:44.180> human<00:03:44.390> would<00:03:44.690> it

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
it is could it look more human would it

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.270 
it is could it look more human would it
be<00:03:44.900> helpful<00:03:45.140> if<00:03:45.470> it<00:03:45.560> looked<00:03:45.800> more<00:03:45.920> human

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
be helpful if it looked more human

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.460 
be helpful if it looked more human
well<00:03:46.519> it<00:03:46.640> could<00:03:46.819> look<00:03:47.060> more<00:03:47.269> human<00:03:47.540> if<00:03:47.840> you<00:03:47.989> put

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
well it could look more human if you put

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:49.540 
well it could look more human if you put

been the beauty of the paralympics that

Pistons stanchions whatever they were I

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.920 
Pistons stanchions whatever they were I
agree<00:04:34.490> that<00:04:34.520> there<00:04:35.240> can<00:04:35.540> be<00:04:35.570> some<00:04:36.880> aesthetic

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
agree that there can be some aesthetic

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.480 
agree that there can be some aesthetic
elements<00:04:38.930> to<00:04:39.110> prosthesis<00:04:39.500> especially<00:04:40.190> if<00:04:40.310> you

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
elements to prosthesis especially if you

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.960 
elements to prosthesis especially if you
do<00:04:40.729> not<00:04:40.940> try<00:04:41.450> to<00:04:41.870> make<00:04:42.830> them<00:04:43.190> look<00:04:43.729> real

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
do not try to make them look real

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.540 
do not try to make them look real
because<00:04:44.210> you<00:04:44.539> always<00:04:44.960> fail<00:04:45.470> if<00:04:45.770> you<00:04:45.830> try<00:04:46.250> to<00:04:46.310> do

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
because you always fail if you try to do

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.580 
because you always fail if you try to do
that<00:04:46.760> and<00:04:47.060> I<00:04:47.120> think<00:04:47.360> one<00:04:47.840> of<00:04:47.870> the<00:04:48.050> examples

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
that and I think one of the examples

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.890 
that and I think one of the examples
that<00:04:48.889> we<00:04:49.310> see<00:04:49.669> here<00:04:49.940> right<00:04:50.240> stop<00:04:50.600> your<00:04:50.630> heart

kind of studied difference and do you

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.719 
kind of studied difference and do you

these<00:06:19.740> are<00:06:19.919> open<00:06:20.130> questions<00:06:20.400> to<00:06:21.120> which<00:06:21.210> I

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:21.479 
these are open questions to which I

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:22.999 
these are open questions to which I
don't<00:06:21.720> have<00:06:21.930> the<00:06:22.080> answer<00:06:22.470> but<00:06:22.650> I<00:06:22.680> think<00:06:22.919> it's

00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:23.009 
don't have the answer but I think it's

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:24.740 
don't have the answer but I think it's
important<00:06:23.490> that<00:06:23.639> we<00:06:24.090> discuss<00:06:24.300> these

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:24.750 
important that we discuss these

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.620 
important that we discuss these
questions<00:06:24.960> now<00:06:25.639> before<00:06:26.639> the<00:06:27.090> technology

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:27.630 
questions now before the technology

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:29.210 
questions now before the technology
becomes<00:06:27.870> a<00:06:28.110> bit<00:06:28.289> that's<00:06:28.620> fascinating<00:06:29.159> and

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:29.220 
becomes a bit that's fascinating and

has an artificial pancreas that can give
off<00:06:35.639> insulin<00:06:36.330> into<00:06:36.990> the<00:06:37.319> artificial<00:06:37.949> blood

00:06:38.809 --> 00:06:38.819 
off insulin into the artificial blood

that flows through the tubing with
tremendous<00:06:41.840> potential<00:06:42.840> for<00:06:43.020> diabetics<00:06:43.590> oh

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:43.800 
tremendous potential for diabetics oh

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.830 
tremendous potential for diabetics oh
absolutely<00:06:44.150> but<00:06:45.150> there's<00:06:45.419> a<00:06:45.479> lot<00:06:45.690> of

absolutely but there's a lot of

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.740 
absolutely but there's a lot of
potential<00:06:46.139> from<00:06:46.440> overcoming<00:06:47.220> many<00:06:47.750> diseases
