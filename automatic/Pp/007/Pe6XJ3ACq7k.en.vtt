freestyle<00:01:37.430> at<00:01:37.579> the<00:01:37.670> Olympics<00:01:38.030> and<00:01:38.270> I<00:01:38.359> really

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
freestyle at the Olympics and I really

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.240 
freestyle at the Olympics and I really

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
felt like he had put everything on the

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.560 
felt like he had put everything on the
line<00:01:40.280> and<00:01:40.579> given<00:01:40.880> me<00:01:40.969> absolutely<00:01:41.359> one<00:01:41.509> hundred

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
line and given me absolutely one hundred

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.270 
line and given me absolutely one hundred
and<00:01:41.780> ten<00:01:41.930> percent<00:01:42.289> you<00:01:42.530> know<00:01:42.649> he<00:01:42.770> can<00:01:42.920> give<00:01:43.159> me

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
and ten percent you know he can give me

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.279

anymore<00:01:43.579> that's<00:01:43.789> extremely<00:01:44.780> emotional

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:45.289 
anymore that's extremely emotional

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:47.289 
anymore that's extremely emotional
feeling<00:01:45.770> and<00:01:45.920> an<00:01:46.159> extremely<00:01:46.850> satisfying

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
feeling and an extremely satisfying

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:50.200 
feeling and an extremely satisfying
feeling<00:01:47.570> to<00:01:47.810> get<00:01:47.960> for<00:01:48.649> him<00:01:48.770> to<00:01:48.950> really<00:01:49.579> just

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
feeling to get for him to really just

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.179 
feeling to get for him to really just
tried<00:01:50.509> his<00:01:50.750> hardest<00:01:50.899> for<00:01:51.350> me<00:01:51.380> on<00:01:51.560> that<00:01:51.740> day<00:01:51.770> was

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
tried his hardest for me on that day was

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:54.279 
tried his hardest for me on that day was
was<00:01:52.759> sort<00:01:53.210> of<00:01:53.270> pretty<00:01:53.630> overwhelming<00:01:54.109> and

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:54.289 
was sort of pretty overwhelming and

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:56.679 
was sort of pretty overwhelming and
that's<00:01:54.770> probably<00:01:55.100> a<00:01:55.340> moment<00:01:56.149> I<00:01:56.240> will<00:01:56.299> never

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:58.690 
that's probably a moment I will never
forget<00:01:57.320> in<00:01:57.469> it<00:01:57.560> still<00:01:57.770> chokes<00:01:58.280> me<00:01:58.490> a<00:01:58.520> bit

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
forget in it still chokes me a bit

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.249 
forget in it still chokes me a bit

compete him in the class well because I

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.450

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
make a decision and I you know the whole

reason<00:02:28.079> of<00:02:28.260> me<00:02:28.409> retiring<00:02:28.860> now<00:02:29.129> is<00:02:29.340> because<00:02:29.489> I

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
reason of me retiring now is because I

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.190 
reason of me retiring now is because I
wanted<00:02:29.879> to<00:02:29.970> do<00:02:30.090> it<00:02:30.180> when<00:02:30.299> he<00:02:30.450> was<00:02:30.599> feeling<00:02:30.900> good

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
wanted to do it when he was feeling good

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.630 
wanted to do it when he was feeling good
and<00:02:31.349> on<00:02:31.470> a<00:02:31.500> high<00:02:31.680> and<00:02:31.950> not<00:02:32.129> wait<00:02:32.310> for<00:02:32.340> him<00:02:32.610> to

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
and on a high and not wait for him to

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.390 
and on a high and not wait for him to
start<00:02:32.909> to<00:02:33.180> to<00:02:33.870> sort<00:02:34.560> of<00:02:34.680> decline<00:02:35.129> and

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
start to to sort of decline and

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.490 
start to to sort of decline and
therefore<00:02:36.060> I<00:02:36.090> think<00:02:36.390> now's<00:02:36.750> a<00:02:36.780> good<00:02:37.049> time<00:02:37.110> and

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
therefore I think now's a good time and

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.470 
therefore I think now's a good time and
it's<00:02:38.040> right<00:02:38.129> but<00:02:38.489> right<00:02:38.819> for<00:02:39.000> him<00:02:39.120> because<00:02:39.269> he

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
it's right but right for him because he

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.360 
it's right but right for him because he
he<00:02:39.989> can't<00:02:40.230> make<00:02:40.319> the<00:02:40.440> decision<00:02:40.769> for<00:02:40.799> himself<00:02:41.040> I

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
he can't make the decision for himself I

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.849 
he can't make the decision for himself I
have<00:02:41.489> to<00:02:41.579> do<00:02:41.670> that<00:02:41.790> for<00:02:42.000> him<00:02:42.120> and<00:02:42.989> he<00:02:43.739> obviously

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:43.859 
have to do that for him and he obviously

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:45.740 
have to do that for him and he obviously
loves<00:02:44.220> being<00:02:44.549> center<00:02:44.970> stage<00:02:45.239> loves<00:02:45.599> the

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
loves being center stage loves the

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.210 
loves being center stage loves the
crowds<00:02:45.989> how<00:02:46.290> I<00:02:46.319> think<00:02:46.560> he's<00:02:46.680> going<00:02:46.799> to<00:02:46.859> handle

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
crowds how I think he's going to handle

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.710 
crowds how I think he's going to handle
his<00:02:47.340> retirement<00:02:47.670> is<00:02:48.209> he<00:02:48.329> gonna<00:02:48.450> miss<00:02:48.690> that

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
his retirement is he gonna miss that

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.809 
his retirement is he gonna miss that
kind<00:02:49.109> of<00:02:49.170> being<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.799> center<00:02:50.280> of<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.400> show<00:02:50.549> I

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
kind of being the center of the show I

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.970 
kind of being the center of the show I
think<00:02:51.150> he'll<00:02:51.409> he'll<00:02:52.409> definitely<00:02:52.560> still<00:02:52.859> need

think he'll he'll definitely still need
