way the future of regenerative medicine
is<00:03:18.870> just<00:03:19.319> very<00:03:19.769> bright<00:03:20.069> we<00:03:20.610> really<00:03:21.000> believe

is just very bright we really believe

is just very bright we really believe
this<00:03:21.510> is<00:03:21.769> the<00:03:22.769> way<00:03:22.890> that<00:03:23.099> medicine<00:03:23.670> will<00:03:24.000> be

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
this is the way that medicine will be

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.059 
this is the way that medicine will be
done<00:03:24.330> in<00:03:24.450> the<00:03:24.599> future<00:03:24.750> and<00:03:25.260> when<00:03:25.500> we<00:03:25.650> look<00:03:25.860> back

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
done in the future and when we look back

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:28.729 
done in the future and when we look back
to<00:03:26.879> some<00:03:27.090> current<00:03:27.330> practices<00:03:28.080> it<00:03:28.349> will<00:03:28.500> seem

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
to some current practices it will seem

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.209 
to some current practices it will seem
