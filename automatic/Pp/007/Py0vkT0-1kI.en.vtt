00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:10.570 
really difficult to move around the

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.540 
really difficult to move around the
trick<00:00:10.870> is<00:00:10.900> and<00:00:11.410> it's<00:00:11.530> not<00:00:11.679> too<00:00:11.889> obvious<00:00:12.070> is

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:12.550 
trick is and it's not too obvious is

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.390 
trick is and it's not too obvious is
just<00:00:13.540> place<00:00:13.719> the<00:00:13.900> cursor<00:00:14.530> somewhere<00:00:14.920> near

finger lightly on the display you'll

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.560 
finger lightly on the display you'll
notice<00:00:19.779> that<00:00:19.810> the<00:00:20.170> cursor<00:00:20.500> went<00:00:21.310> hollow<00:00:21.580> at

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:22.570 
notice that the cursor went hollow at

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.019 
notice that the cursor went hollow at
which<00:00:22.720> point<00:00:22.960> you<00:00:23.170> can<00:00:23.350> now<00:00:23.470> move<00:00:23.850> left<00:00:24.850> right

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:25.029 
which point you can now move left right

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:30.900 
which point you can now move left right
up<00:00:25.420> and<00:00:25.750> down<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:27.010> easily<00:00:27.430> navigate<00:00:29.760> I'll<00:00:30.760> do

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:30.910 
up and down to easily navigate I'll do

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:32.569 
up and down to easily navigate I'll do
that<00:00:31.029> again<00:00:31.330> pull<00:00:31.779> it<00:00:31.840> up<00:00:31.869> a<00:00:31.960> little<00:00:32.050> closer

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
that again pull it up a little closer

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.680 
that again pull it up a little closer
we're<00:00:33.579> on<00:00:33.640> the<00:00:33.730> h<00:00:33.910> now<00:00:34.210> I'm<00:00:34.270> just<00:00:34.480> going<00:00:34.660> to

once<00:00:37.120> it<00:00:37.239> goes<00:00:37.329> hollow<00:00:37.829> you<00:00:38.829> can<00:00:38.980> easily<00:00:39.100> move

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 
once it goes hollow you can easily move

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:40.880 
once it goes hollow you can easily move
it<00:00:39.579> around<00:00:39.670> and<00:00:40.000> get<00:00:40.090> to<00:00:40.210> the<00:00:40.239> letter<00:00:40.450> I<00:00:40.510> want
