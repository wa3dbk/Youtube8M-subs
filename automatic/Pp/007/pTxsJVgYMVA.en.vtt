before in there's yes I trained this
champion<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.390> lot<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:00.840> think<00:01:01.829> I<00:01:01.949> can<00:01:02.160> still<00:01:02.579> learn

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
champion a lot I think I can still learn

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.090 
champion a lot I think I can still learn
to<00:01:03.420> play<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.840> bit<00:01:04.019> better<00:01:04.170> with<00:01:04.439> this<00:01:04.589> champion

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
to play a bit better with this champion

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.420 
to play a bit better with this champion
but<00:01:05.369> I<00:01:05.400> did<00:01:05.820> pretty<00:01:06.000> fine<00:01:06.299> i<00:01:06.330> think<00:01:07.250> so<00:01:08.250> yeah

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
but I did pretty fine i think so yeah

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.210 
but I did pretty fine i think so yeah
like<00:01:08.640> yesterday<00:01:09.390> there<00:01:09.810> were<00:01:09.900> many<00:01:10.220> support

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
like yesterday there were many support

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.640 
like yesterday there were many support
bands<00:01:11.460> in<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.880> match<00:01:12.210> against<00:01:12.540> sk<00:01:12.960> so<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.409> will

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
bands in the match against sk so it will

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.429 
bands in the match against sk so it will
it<00:01:13.890> was<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.130> bit<00:01:14.369> harder<00:01:14.790> for<00:01:15.000> me<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.210> pick<00:01:16.140> like

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
it was a bit harder for me to pick like

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.310 
it was a bit harder for me to pick like
my<00:01:16.950> most<00:01:17.369> comfortable<00:01:17.490> champ<00:01:18.210> but<00:01:18.600> today<00:01:19.259> it

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
my most comfortable champ but today it

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.770 
my most comfortable champ but today it
was<00:01:19.380> fine<00:01:19.710> i<00:01:19.740> think<00:01:19.950> what<00:01:20.880> do<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.240> take<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:21.659> as

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
was fine i think what do you take it as

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.300 
was fine i think what do you take it as
a<00:01:21.810> compliment<00:01:22.380> is<00:01:22.500> it<00:01:22.619> when<00:01:22.799> they<00:01:22.920> ban<00:01:23.100> out

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
a compliment is it when they ban out

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.890 
a compliment is it when they ban out
this<00:01:23.729> many<00:01:23.939> supports<00:01:24.330> that<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.509> like<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.659> play

like I said we told that they're going
to<00:01:44.460> pick<00:01:44.640> like<00:01:44.880> trundle<00:01:45.390> analyzing<00:01:46.049> their

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
to pick like trundle analyzing their

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.590 
to pick like trundle analyzing their
first<00:01:46.439> rotations<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.430> trade<00:01:47.790> it<00:01:47.820> for<00:01:48.240> trash

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.230 
but they didn't aunt a pic to renekton
again<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:52.049> loot<00:01:52.259> sense<00:01:52.530> so<00:01:53.009> we<00:01:53.460> just<00:01:53.700> went<00:01:53.909> for

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
again and loot sense so we just went for

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.870 
again and loot sense so we just went for
trundle<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:54.810> allies<00:01:55.259> because<00:01:56.070> those<00:01:56.610> are<00:01:56.850> our

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
trundle and allies because those are our

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.719 
trundle and allies because those are our
comfortable<00:01:57.689> peaks<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.320> we<00:01:59.280> thought<00:01:59.460> that

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
comfortable peaks and we thought that

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.149 
comfortable peaks and we thought that
those<00:02:00.479> pigs<00:02:00.810> are<00:02:00.960> better<00:02:01.200> than<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.799> other

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
those pigs are better than the other

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.060 
those pigs are better than the other
ones<00:02:02.430> so<00:02:02.670> all-in-all<00:02:03.659> third<00:02:04.320> place<00:02:04.740> here<00:02:05.040> in

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
ones so all-in-all third place here in

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.800 
ones so all-in-all third place here in
the<00:02:05.219> spring<00:02:05.460> splits<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:05.939> actually<00:02:06.450> your<00:02:06.570> very

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
the spring splits and actually your very

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.169 
the spring splits and actually your very
first<00:02:07.049> season<00:02:07.680> in<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:07.979> LCS<00:02:08.429> that<00:02:08.700> is<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:08.849> great

firstly we started very well the season
we<00:02:22.069> were<00:02:22.219> winning<00:02:22.430> most<00:02:22.790> games<00:02:23.150> we<00:02:23.629> were<00:02:23.780> first

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
we were winning most games we were first

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.629 
we were winning most games we were first
for<00:02:24.620> like<00:02:24.889> three<00:02:25.430> weeks<00:02:25.609> maybe<00:02:26.239> and<00:02:26.859> then<00:02:27.859> we

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:28.639 
for like three weeks maybe and then we
