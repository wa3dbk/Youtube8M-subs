00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.610
 so hello here we have winter today first 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:16.410
 times were freeze -22 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:22.800
 lasting gives to the wind yesterday was 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:25.130
 strong calmed down today try 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.130
 to bring 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:43.830
 turn on 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:46.910
 glow plugs and try to say just around the corner 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.910
 not in a hurry but still 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.060
 but guys 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.060
 wound up 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:01.140
 I will say of course I break confidently work 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:04.860
 that's 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.940
 and leveled off 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.409
 you try to let go of the clutch 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.930
 fine 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:27.380
 all once fully let go works on 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.380
 idle 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:38.830
 basically everything is fine 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:41.180
 but the same day is half an hour ahead 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:45.040
 see how it gets warmed up 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.040
 engine all 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:52.300
 the engine will earn the temperature almost at 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.880
 the norm stood in five minutes 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.020
 blew it as a bitter cold and wind 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.170
 present 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:05.939
 because the arrow was slightly better 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:05.939
 by the way mileage at the car almost 333,000 

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:09.640
 that's it
