00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
to a gun which is cool so for

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.330 
to a gun which is cool so for
transformation<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.890> first<00:01:17.100> thing<00:01:17.220> we're

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340

then just take the arm and fold it up

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.240 
then just take the arm and fold it up
like<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:30.200> okay<00:01:31.200> then<00:01:31.619> we're<00:01:31.979> going<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.130> take

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.190 
like that okay then we're going to take
the<00:01:32.640> fusion<00:01:33.030> cannon<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.600> lift<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:33.930> up<00:01:34.020> a

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
the fusion cannon and lift it up a

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.929 
the fusion cannon and lift it up a
little<00:01:34.380> bit<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:35.310> we're<00:01:35.430> going<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.640> take<00:01:35.759> the

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
just lift the fusion cannon up and

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.030 
just lift the fusion cannon up and
becomes<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.130> barrel<00:01:50.490> of<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.670> gun<00:01:51.829> push<00:01:52.829> the

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
becomes the barrel of the gun push the

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.060 
becomes the barrel of the gun push the
head<00:01:53.189> down<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:54.710> then<00:01:55.710> you're<00:01:55.829> going<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:55.979> take

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
head down and then you're going to take

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.230 
head down and then you're going to take
the<00:01:56.369> legs<00:01:56.610> just<00:01:57.450> flip<00:01:57.750> them<00:01:57.990> over<00:01:58.170> or<00:01:59.240> twist

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
the legs just flip them over or twist

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.749 
the legs just flip them over or twist
them<00:02:00.420> over<00:02:00.630> like<00:02:00.719> that<00:02:00.990> I<00:02:01.259> just<00:02:02.070> fold<00:02:02.369> them<00:02:02.579> up

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
them over like that I just fold them up

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:07.310 
them over like that I just fold them up
against<00:02:05.759> each<00:02:05.909> other<00:02:06.119> like<00:02:06.360> that<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:06.990> that

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
against each other like that and that

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.600 
against each other like that and that
becomes<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:08.069> handle

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.930 

so<00:02:12.610> there<00:02:12.880> you<00:02:12.910> have<00:02:13.830> Megatron<00:02:14.830> in<00:02:15.190> his<00:02:15.580> gun

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
so there you have Megatron in his gun

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.260 
so there you have Megatron in his gun
mode<00:02:16.650> it<00:02:17.650> looks<00:02:17.950> better<00:02:18.130> from<00:02:18.400> this<00:02:18.610> side<00:02:18.910> as

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
mode it looks better from this side as

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.290 
mode it looks better from this side as
you<00:02:19.450> don't<00:02:19.630> see<00:02:19.810> so<00:02:20.020> much<00:02:20.170> kibble<00:02:21.120> from<00:02:22.120> this

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
you don't see so much kibble from this

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.160 
you don't see so much kibble from this
side<00:02:22.510> you<00:02:22.540> see<00:02:22.900> his<00:02:23.370> abdomen<00:02:24.450> which<00:02:25.450> is<00:02:25.630> fine<00:02:25.900> I

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
side you see his abdomen which is fine I

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.160 
side you see his abdomen which is fine I
mean<00:02:26.440> still<00:02:27.310> having<00:02:27.819> a<00:02:28.000> Megatron<00:02:28.870> and<00:02:28.900> is

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
mean still having a Megatron and is

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.190 
mean still having a Megatron and is
going<00:02:29.380> to<00:02:29.470> notice<00:02:29.650> very<00:02:30.220> very<00:02:30.580> nice

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200
