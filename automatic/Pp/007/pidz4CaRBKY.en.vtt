do lose some of my focal length because
it<00:03:57.920> crops<00:03:58.160> it<00:03:58.370> one<00:03:58.520> and<00:03:58.640> a<00:03:58.700> half<00:03:58.730> times<00:03:58.850> at<00:03:59.570> any

it crops it one and a half times at any

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.780 
it crops it one and a half times at any
rate<00:03:59.990> i<00:04:00.170> like<00:04:00.380> the<00:04:00.500> sony<00:04:00.680> a7<00:04:01.130> for<00:04:01.310> the<00:04:01.370> price<00:04:01.610> i

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
rate i like the sony a7 for the price i

rate i like the sony a7 for the price i
think<00:04:01.820> that's<00:04:02.210> the<00:04:02.450> best<00:04:02.570> deal<00:04:02.890> but<00:04:03.890> i'm<00:04:03.980> a<00:04:04.010> fan

filmmaking<00:04:22.730> i'm<00:04:22.940> guessing<00:04:23.360> this<00:04:24.290> has<00:04:24.410> been

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
filmmaking i'm guessing this has been

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:25.700 
filmmaking i'm guessing this has been
something<00:04:24.740> i<00:04:24.890> wanted<00:04:25.190> to<00:04:25.310> do<00:04:25.430> for

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
something i wanted to do for

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.070 
something i wanted to do for
while<00:04:25.889> I've<00:04:26.100> wanted<00:04:26.370> to<00:04:26.520> write<00:04:26.669> an<00:04:26.789> e-book

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
while I've wanted to write an e-book

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.140 
while I've wanted to write an e-book
mostly<00:04:28.080> using<00:04:28.620> available<00:04:28.889> stuff<00:04:29.850> I<00:04:29.970> had

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
mostly using available stuff I had

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.210 
mostly using available stuff I had
already<00:04:30.330> namely<00:04:30.900> like<00:04:31.169> my<00:04:31.289> top<00:04:31.500> 25<00:04:31.919> DIY

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
already namely like my top 25 DIY

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.219 
already namely like my top 25 DIY
projects<00:04:33.030> and<00:04:33.090> put<00:04:33.300> them<00:04:33.419> in<00:04:33.479> an<00:04:33.569> ebook<00:04:33.900> form

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:34.229 
projects and put them in an ebook form

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:36.439 
projects and put them in an ebook form
however<00:04:34.830> I<00:04:35.039> like<00:04:35.220> the<00:04:35.280> idea<00:04:35.520> of<00:04:35.759> expanding

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:36.449 
however I like the idea of expanding

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:40.249 
however I like the idea of expanding
into<00:04:37.020> their<00:04:37.199> ebooks<00:04:37.970> hard<00:04:38.970> copy<00:04:39.389> printing<00:04:40.020> I'm

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:40.259 
into their ebooks hard copy printing I'm

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:41.870 
into their ebooks hard copy printing I'm
not<00:04:40.410> so<00:04:40.560> sure<00:04:40.590> about<00:04:40.919> because<00:04:41.370> it<00:04:41.400> just<00:04:41.639> takes

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
not so sure about because it just takes

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.330 
not so sure about because it just takes
more<00:04:42.060> materials<00:04:42.750> more<00:04:43.020> resources<00:04:43.500> and<00:04:44.250> it

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
more materials more resources and it

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.129 
more materials more resources and it
costs<00:04:44.669> more<00:04:44.819> like<00:04:45.150> the<00:04:45.270> idea<00:04:45.479> of<00:04:45.539> e-books<00:04:45.870> so

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:46.139 
costs more like the idea of e-books so

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:48.260 
costs more like the idea of e-books so
that's<00:04:46.740> what<00:04:46.889> I<00:04:46.919> would<00:04:47.039> do<00:04:47.130> first<00:04:47.460> but<00:04:48.060> I<00:04:48.120> also

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
that's what I would do first but I also

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.730 
that's what I would do first but I also
think<00:04:48.360> it<00:04:48.599> might<00:04:48.720> be<00:04:48.750> a<00:04:48.840> better<00:04:48.990> idea<00:04:49.139> maybe

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
think it might be a better idea maybe

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.710 
think it might be a better idea maybe
you<00:04:49.919> guys<00:04:50.039> can<00:04:50.250> chime<00:04:50.550> in<00:04:50.580> to<00:04:51.479> do<00:04:51.599> something

you guys can chime in to do something

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
that's completely original or not

object and then lock it so it stays

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.540

it's<00:06:51.120> going<00:06:51.240> to<00:06:51.300> be<00:06:51.419> getting<00:06:52.110> dark<00:06:52.440> and

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:52.560 
it's going to be getting dark and

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:53.750 
it's going to be getting dark and
getting<00:06:52.830> bright<00:06:53.040> all<00:06:53.220> the<00:06:53.310> time<00:06:53.490> as<00:06:53.639> the

doesn't go all over the place that's

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.140 
doesn't go all over the place that's
really<00:06:58.500> important<00:06:58.919> I'm<00:06:59.490> not<00:06:59.610> sure<00:06:59.669> exactly
