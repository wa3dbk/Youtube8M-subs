00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
should try to get a bunch of keys

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.370 
should try to get a bunch of keys
together<00:02:47.820> before<00:02:48.450> you're<00:02:48.570> ready<00:02:48.750> to<00:02:48.900> go<00:02:49.230> and

together before you're ready to go and
start<00:02:49.500> farming<00:02:50.010> I<00:02:50.310> would<00:02:50.820> say<00:02:51.000> at<00:02:51.209> least<00:02:51.240> 30

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
start farming I would say at least 30

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.230 
start farming I would say at least 30
this<00:02:52.200> will<00:02:52.350> give<00:02:52.500> you<00:02:52.680> one<00:02:52.980> map<00:02:53.370> rotation<00:02:53.580> on

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
this will give you one map rotation on

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.680 
this will give you one map rotation on
average<00:02:55.200> but<00:02:56.070> I<00:02:56.310> have<00:02:56.640> quite<00:02:56.910> a<00:02:56.970> few<00:02:57.090> as<00:02:57.510> you're

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.770 
somewhat unlikely that you're going to
push<00:07:33.360> it<00:07:33.570> into<00:07:34.050> those<00:07:34.610> events<00:07:35.610> because<00:07:36.420> you're

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:36.780 
push it into those events because you're

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:38.360 
push it into those events because you're
really<00:07:36.930> just<00:07:37.050> chest<00:07:37.590> farming<00:07:38.040> you're<00:07:38.190> not

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:38.370 
really just chest farming you're not

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:41.810 
really just chest farming you're not
really<00:07:38.580> pushing<00:07:38.820> events<00:07:39.330> in<00:07:39.420> the<00:07:39.510> map<00:07:39.690> but<00:07:40.820> it

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:41.820 
really pushing events in the map but it

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:44.030 
really pushing events in the map but it
does<00:07:42.090> have<00:07:42.270> a<00:07:42.300> chance<00:07:42.510> to<00:07:43.170> happen<00:07:43.530> or<00:07:43.710> it<00:07:43.890> can

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:44.040 
does have a chance to happen or it can

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.310 
does have a chance to happen or it can
happen<00:07:44.280> where<00:07:44.610> it<00:07:44.670> does<00:07:44.820> happen<00:07:45.180> sometimes<00:07:45.600> so

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:46.320 
happen where it does happen sometimes so

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:47.480 
happen where it does happen sometimes so
I<00:07:46.350> just<00:07:46.530> thought<00:07:46.650> I<00:07:46.710> would<00:07:46.830> make<00:07:47.040> you<00:07:47.190> aware<00:07:47.430> of

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:47.490 
I just thought I would make you aware of

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:49.340 
I just thought I would make you aware of
that<00:07:47.580> definitely<00:07:48.150> stop<00:07:48.390> and<00:07:48.690> do<00:07:48.840> those<00:07:49.020> events

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:49.350 
that definitely stop and do those events

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:50.750 
that definitely stop and do those events
not<00:07:49.590> only<00:07:49.740> could<00:07:49.890> you<00:07:49.920> get<00:07:50.130> more<00:07:50.280> keys<00:07:50.580> and

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:50.760 
not only could you get more keys and

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:53.480 
not only could you get more keys and
shovels<00:07:51.120> but<00:07:51.960> there's<00:07:52.260> other<00:07:52.530> good<00:07:53.040> loot<00:07:53.310> to

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:53.490 
shovels but there's other good loot to

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:56.540 
shovels but there's other good loot to
get<00:07:53.760> from<00:07:54.060> that<00:07:54.330> those<00:07:54.870> events<00:07:55.140> as<00:07:55.590> well<00:07:56.190> I

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:56.550 
get from that those events as well I

00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:58.790 
get from that those events as well I
