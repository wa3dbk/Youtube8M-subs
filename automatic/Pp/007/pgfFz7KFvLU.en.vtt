might even work a little bit different

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.779 
might even work a little bit different
but<00:00:58.199> it's<00:00:58.350> still<00:00:58.530> going<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.710> be<00:00:58.770> really<00:00:59.670> good

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
but it's still going to be really good

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.970

this<00:01:02.489> has<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.910> potential<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.420> add<00:01:03.629> so<00:01:03.960> much

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
this has the potential to add so much

if it's gonna be like end of the line a

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.899 
if it's gonna be like end of the line a
rather<00:01:52.829> than<00:01:53.070> just<00:01:53.250> wait<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.670> release

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909

rather than just wait and release
something<00:01:54.259> decent<00:01:55.259> but<00:01:55.439> I'm<00:01:55.560> hoping<00:01:55.920> it's

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.320 
and fun idea for us all to do I already
know<00:03:37.680> what<00:03:37.920> team<00:03:38.160> I'm<00:03:38.400> gonna<00:03:38.580> pick<00:03:38.910> when<00:03:39.209> the

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
know what team I'm gonna pick when the

update comes out I want to be team ng

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.699 
update comes out I want to be team ng
but<00:03:41.640> that's<00:03:41.820> because<00:03:42.000> the<00:03:42.840> engineer<00:03:43.350> is<00:03:43.530> one

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
but that's because the engineer is one

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.920 
but that's because the engineer is one
of<00:03:43.830> my<00:03:43.920> primary<00:03:44.250> focused<00:03:44.880> classes<00:03:45.420> whereas

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
of my primary focused classes whereas

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.300 
of my primary focused classes whereas
the<00:03:46.050> spire<00:03:46.320> don't<00:03:46.620> really<00:03:46.830> play<00:03:46.980> so<00:03:47.040> much

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310
