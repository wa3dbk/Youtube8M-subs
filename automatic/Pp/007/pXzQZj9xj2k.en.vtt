00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
then I use a new kind of attack like

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.420 
then I use a new kind of attack like
muddy<00:02:35.569> water<00:02:35.870> is<00:02:36.110> something<00:02:37.100> that<00:02:37.190> not<00:02:37.370> many

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
people use but it's great because it

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.860 
people use but it's great because it
doesn't<00:02:39.769> attack<00:02:40.160> plan<00:02:40.610> parole<00:02:40.940> and<00:02:41.120> it<00:02:41.750> can

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
doesn't attack plan parole and it can

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.620 
doesn't attack plan parole and it can
lower<00:02:42.380> the<00:02:42.590> opponent's<00:02:42.950> accuracy<00:02:43.550> so<00:02:44.450> that's

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
lower the opponent's accuracy so that's

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.470
