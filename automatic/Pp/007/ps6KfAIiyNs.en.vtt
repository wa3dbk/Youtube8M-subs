off what we're looking at here is oak

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.290 
off what we're looking at here is oak
and<00:00:25.110> oak<00:00:25.470> branch<00:00:25.830> with<00:00:26.250> leaves<00:00:26.520> on<00:00:26.850> it<00:00:26.970> and<00:00:27.180> you

I<00:00:32.000> mean<00:00:33.000> look<00:00:33.149> at<00:00:33.270> that<00:00:33.450> now<00:00:33.660> this<00:00:33.810> was<00:00:34.020> just

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
I mean look at that now this was just

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.410 
I mean look at that now this was just
taken<00:00:34.680> off<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.920> tree<00:00:35.190> I<00:00:35.430> can<00:00:35.700> show<00:00:35.910> you<00:00:35.970> and

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
taken off the tree I can show you and

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.389 
taken off the tree I can show you and
you<00:00:37.020> can<00:00:37.140> look<00:00:37.260> in<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.470> other<00:00:37.590> videos<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:37.980> see

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
you can look in the other videos and see

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:39.889 
you can look in the other videos and see
these<00:00:38.579> on<00:00:38.880> the<00:00:39.090> tree<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:39.630> know<00:00:39.720> they're

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
these on the tree you know they're

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.590 
these on the tree you know they're
growing<00:00:40.260> like<00:00:40.470> this<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.130> I<00:00:42.030> notice<00:00:42.450> that

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
growing like this and I notice that

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.450 
growing like this and I notice that
they're<00:00:42.750> not<00:00:42.870> brown<00:00:43.230> that<00:00:43.829> they<00:00:43.980> are<00:00:44.130> green

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
they're not brown that they are green

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.610 
they're not brown that they are green
this<00:00:44.790> isn't<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.120> result<00:00:45.510> of<00:00:45.719> fall<00:00:46.050> or<00:00:46.350> anything

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
this isn't a result of fall or anything

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.049 
this isn't a result of fall or anything
like<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:46.800> like<00:00:47.190> we<00:00:47.340> said<00:00:47.520> we<00:00:47.640> can<00:00:47.790> see<00:00:47.969> in

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
like that like we said we can see in

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.850 
like that like we said we can see in
this<00:00:48.120> for<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.390> few<00:00:48.570> months<00:00:48.950> that's<00:00:49.950> pretty

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
this for a few months that's pretty

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.400 
this for a few months that's pretty
pretty<00:00:52.860> bad<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.309> say<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.640> least<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:54.210> uh<00:00:54.410> like

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
pretty bad to say the least and uh like

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.930 
pretty bad to say the least and uh like
we<00:00:55.590> said<00:00:55.770> we<00:00:55.950> think<00:00:55.980> it<00:00:56.280> has<00:00:56.399> something<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:56.850> do

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
we said we think it has something to do

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.270 
we said we think it has something to do
with<00:00:57.059> radiation<00:00:57.450> and<00:00:58.320> we<00:00:58.469> might<00:00:58.739> be<00:00:58.980> able<00:00:59.070> to

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
with radiation and we might be able to

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.799 
with radiation and we might be able to
prove<00:00:59.489> that<00:00:59.700> theory<00:01:00.000> here<00:01:00.329> right<00:01:00.510> in<00:01:00.539> front<00:01:00.750> of

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
prove that theory here right in front of

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.779 
prove that theory here right in front of
your<00:01:00.960> eyes<00:01:01.039> alright<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.160> next<00:01:02.309> one<00:01:02.550> what<00:01:02.700> we

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
your eyes alright the next one what we

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.340 
your eyes alright the next one what we
got<00:01:03.000> is<00:01:04.549> this<00:01:05.549> is<00:01:05.760> wild<00:01:06.119> great<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:07.170> can

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
got is this is wild great and you can

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.990 
got is this is wild great and you can
see<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.590> black<00:01:08.250> spots<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:09.830> don't<00:01:10.970> you<00:01:11.970> know

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
see the black spots I don't you know

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.969 
see the black spots I don't you know
sometimes<00:01:12.630> almost<00:01:12.900> think<00:01:13.440> that<00:01:13.530> these<00:01:13.740> could

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
sometimes almost think that these could

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.250 
sometimes almost think that these could
be<00:01:14.070> hot<00:01:14.250> articles<00:01:14.820> from<00:01:15.119> Fukushima<00:01:15.689> I'm<00:01:16.140> not

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:16.260 
be hot articles from Fukushima I'm not

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.380 
be hot articles from Fukushima I'm not
sure<00:01:16.530> I'm<00:01:16.860> really<00:01:17.100> not<00:01:17.250> but<00:01:17.909> what<00:01:18.119> I<00:01:18.150> do<00:01:18.270> know

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
is that the new growth is curling up see

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.200 
is that the new growth is curling up see
this<00:01:22.830> this<00:01:22.890> is<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.400> new<00:01:23.549> growth<00:01:23.850> it's

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
this this is the new growth it's

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.020 
this this is the new growth it's
mutating<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.200> curling<00:01:25.590> up<00:01:25.770> now<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.820> know<00:01:26.909> if

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
mutating and curling up now you know if

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.520 
mutating and curling up now you know if
this<00:01:27.180> is<00:01:27.330> just<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.720> result<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:28.080> fall<00:01:28.320> we

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
this is just a result of fall we

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.719 
this is just a result of fall we
wouldn't<00:01:28.770> be<00:01:28.860> still<00:01:29.070> have<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.250> new<00:01:29.520> growth

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
wouldn't be still have a new growth

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.359 
wouldn't be still have a new growth
that's<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:30.060> vegetative<00:01:30.570> state<00:01:30.710> so<00:01:31.710> we<00:01:32.100> have<00:01:32.250> the

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
that's a vegetative state so we have the

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.390 
that's a vegetative state so we have the
new<00:01:32.580> growth<00:01:32.880> that<00:01:33.509> is<00:01:33.710> mutating<00:01:34.710> plus<00:01:35.220> the

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
new growth that is mutating plus the

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.160 
new growth that is mutating plus the
spots<00:01:35.729> like<00:01:36.119> i<00:01:36.210> said<00:01:36.270> i<00:01:36.479> think<00:01:36.570> that's<00:01:36.840> wild

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
spots like i said i think that's wild

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.609 
spots like i said i think that's wild
great<00:01:37.970> here<00:01:38.970> we<00:01:39.000> have<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.630> honeysuckle<00:01:40.110> bush

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
great here we have a honeysuckle bush

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.910 
great here we have a honeysuckle bush
and<00:01:40.979> this<00:01:41.610> is<00:01:41.790> a

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
and this is a

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.310 
and this is a
mid<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:43.950> late<00:01:44.280> august<00:01:44.310> right<00:01:44.940> now<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:46.140> can

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
mid to late august right now and you can

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.740 
mid to late august right now and you can
see<00:01:46.650> that<00:01:47.220> it's<00:01:47.430> blooming<00:01:47.850> out<00:01:47.970> of<00:01:48.120> season<00:01:48.300> for

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
see that it's blooming out of season for
