00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.260 
I'd game title yes this title is 99
cents<00:00:15.630> which<00:00:15.780> is<00:00:15.990> pretty<00:00:16.199> rare<00:00:16.470> but<00:00:17.400> the

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
cents which is pretty rare but the

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.320 
cents which is pretty rare but the
lasting<00:00:18.630> value<00:00:18.750> is<00:00:18.960> really<00:00:19.350> really<00:00:19.590> short<00:00:19.800> and

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:20.330 
lasting value is really really short and

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.640 
lasting value is really really short and
you<00:00:21.330> only<00:00:21.449> have<00:00:21.660> about<00:00:21.779> an<00:00:22.050> hour<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.470> half

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
you only have about an hour and a half

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.710 
you only have about an hour and a half
or<00:00:22.920> maybe<00:00:23.130> two<00:00:23.460> hours<00:00:23.490> of<00:00:23.970> lasting<00:00:24.300> value<00:00:24.359> in

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
or maybe two hours of lasting value in

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.050 
or maybe two hours of lasting value in
the<00:00:24.810> game<00:00:24.990> you<00:00:25.769> have<00:00:25.890> these<00:00:26.039> five<00:00:26.400> level<00:00:26.820> sets

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
the game you have these five level sets

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.410 
the game you have these five level sets
total<00:00:27.420> and<00:00:28.429> they<00:00:29.429> take<00:00:29.699> about<00:00:29.910> 20<00:00:30.390> minutes

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
total and they take about 20 minutes

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.130 
total and they take about 20 minutes
each<00:00:30.869> like<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:32.460> third<00:00:32.730> one<00:00:32.940> there<00:00:33.090> took<00:00:33.390> me<00:00:33.660> 20

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
each like the third one there took me 20

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.840 
each like the third one there took me 20
minutes<00:00:34.170> so<00:00:34.829> that<00:00:34.890> means<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.309> first<00:00:35.579> ones

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
minutes so that means the first ones

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.520 
minutes so that means the first ones
will<00:00:36.120> be<00:00:36.149> even<00:00:36.540> shorter<00:00:36.690> because<00:00:37.230> they're

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
will be even shorter because they're

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.650 
will be even shorter because they're
easier<00:00:37.920> later<00:00:38.489> ones<00:00:38.790> will<00:00:38.910> be<00:00:39.000> longer<00:00:39.239> so

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
easier later ones will be longer so

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.080 
easier later ones will be longer so
averages<00:00:40.290> out<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.469> about<00:00:40.620> 20<00:00:41.100> minutes<00:00:41.280> which

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
averages out to about 20 minutes which

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.470 
averages out to about 20 minutes which
is<00:00:42.329> only<00:00:42.780> about<00:00:42.960> an<00:00:43.530> hour<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.760> 40<00:00:45.090> minutes<00:00:45.270> of

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
is only about an hour and 40 minutes of

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.869 
is only about an hour and 40 minutes of
gameplay<00:00:45.829> not<00:00:46.829> much<00:00:47.039> at<00:00:47.070> all<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.550> the

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
gameplay not much at all and the

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.400 
gameplay not much at all and the
gameplay<00:00:48.239> is<00:00:48.300> really<00:00:48.360> boring<00:00:48.930> not

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
gameplay is really boring not

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.010 
gameplay is really boring not
challenging<00:00:49.980> at<00:00:50.129> all<00:00:50.280> I<00:00:50.489> can<00:00:51.120> play<00:00:51.300> nearly<00:00:51.719> the

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
challenging at all I can play nearly the

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.279 
challenging at all I can play nearly the
entire<00:00:52.350> game<00:00:52.789> one-handed<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:53.969> still<00:00:54.719> get<00:00:54.989> all

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
entire game one-handed and still get all

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.779 
entire game one-handed and still get all
the<00:00:55.770> stars<00:00:56.070> on<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.449> so<00:00:57.449> really<00:00:58.440> boring<00:00:58.800> what

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
the stars on it so really boring what

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.090 
the stars on it so really boring what
you<00:00:59.910> do<00:01:00.059> is<00:01:00.270> use<00:01:00.480> control<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.260> game<00:01:01.440> through

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
you do is use control the game through

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.670 
you do is use control the game through
tilting<00:01:02.879> your<00:01:03.000> phone<00:01:03.210> or<00:01:03.449> you<00:01:03.690> can<00:01:03.960> use<00:01:03.989> touch

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
tilting your phone or you can use touch

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.679 
tilting your phone or you can use touch
controls<00:01:05.189> actually<00:01:05.610> so<00:01:06.180> that's<00:01:06.299> kind<00:01:06.510> of<00:01:06.540> nice

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
controls actually so that's kind of nice

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.760 
controls actually so that's kind of nice
for<00:01:06.930> people<00:01:07.080> who<00:01:07.560> aren't<00:01:07.950> big<00:01:08.580> fans<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:09.119> the

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
for people who aren't big fans of the

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.109 
for people who aren't big fans of the
gesture<00:01:10.770> controls<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.610> they<00:01:11.670> like<00:01:11.850> touch

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
gesture controls and they like touch

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.820 
gesture controls and they like touch
controls<00:01:12.600> you<00:01:12.900> can<00:01:12.930> just<00:01:13.200> switch<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.470> right

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
controls you can just switch it right

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.359 
controls you can just switch it right
there<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:15.020> going<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.110> try<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.320> restart<00:01:17.159> it

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
there and going to try to restart it

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.260 
there and going to try to restart it
there<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.700> try<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:17.939> get<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:18.270> other<00:01:18.390> lollipop

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
there to try to get that other lollipop

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.640 
there to try to get that other lollipop
so<00:01:21.270> there's<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.479> variety<00:01:21.630> different<00:01:21.960> surfaces

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
so there's a variety different surfaces

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.140 
so there's a variety different surfaces
there<00:01:22.920> some<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.250> these<00:01:23.310> services<00:01:23.820> bounce

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
there some of these services bounce

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.870 
there some of these services bounce
somewhat<00:01:24.869> some<00:01:25.140> of<00:01:25.229> them<00:01:25.320> are<00:01:25.500> actually

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
somewhat some of them are actually

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.580 
somewhat some of them are actually
springy<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.299> they<00:01:27.840> completely<00:01:28.409> bounce<00:01:28.799> and

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
springy and they completely bounce and

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.740 
springy and they completely bounce and
oops<00:01:34.759> looks<00:01:35.759> like<00:01:35.939> I<00:01:36.030> would<00:01:36.210> have<00:01:36.240> had<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.659> get

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
oops looks like I would have had to get

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.719 
oops looks like I would have had to get
more<00:01:37.110> momentum<00:01:37.710> on<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:38.040> one<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.430> actually

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
more momentum on that one to actually

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.580 
more momentum on that one to actually
get<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.509> got<00:01:39.659> these<00:01:39.840> little<00:01:40.020> swinging

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
get it you got these little swinging

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.730 
get it you got these little swinging
things<00:01:40.920> here<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:41.700> there's<00:01:42.479> big<00:01:42.720> variety<00:01:42.990> there

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
things here so there's big variety there

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.050 
things here so there's big variety there
it's<00:01:44.579> just<00:01:44.850> that<00:01:45.710> it<00:01:46.710> never<00:01:47.189> really<00:01:47.579> becomes

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
it's just that it never really becomes

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.899 
it's just that it never really becomes
that<00:01:48.299> challenging<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.549> there<00:01:50.549> are<00:01:50.640> some

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
that challenging and there are some

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.580 
that challenging and there are some
things<00:01:51.180> where<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.540> think<00:01:51.750> oh<00:01:51.930> that's<00:01:52.259> pretty

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
things where you think oh that's pretty

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.469 
things where you think oh that's pretty
cool<00:01:52.890> but<00:01:53.250> it's<00:01:53.460> still<00:01:53.670> never<00:01:53.909> challenging

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
cool but it's still never challenging

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.109 
cool but it's still never challenging
and<00:01:54.659> I<00:01:55.170> came<00:01:55.710> should<00:01:56.399> be<00:01:56.579> challenging

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
and I came should be challenging

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.480 
and I came should be challenging
otherwise<00:01:58.079> why<00:01:58.350> you're<00:01:58.619> actually<00:01:58.799> playing<00:01:59.250> it

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
otherwise why you're actually playing it

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.319 
otherwise why you're actually playing it
in<00:01:59.640> doing<00:02:00.060> something<00:02:00.860> so<00:02:01.939> this<00:02:02.939> game<00:02:03.180> could

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
in doing something so this game could

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.749 
in doing something so this game could
definitely<00:02:03.719> use<00:02:03.869> some<00:02:04.409> more<00:02:04.860> skill<00:02:05.219> more

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
definitely use some more skill more

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.660 
definitely use some more skill more
levels<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:07.380> visuals<00:02:07.860> are<00:02:07.979> okay<00:02:08.369> but<00:02:08.429> the

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
three lollipops so that gives you an

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.190 
three lollipops so that gives you an
idea<00:02:47.739> of<00:02:48.069> how<00:02:48.430> ridiculously<00:02:49.209> easy<00:02:49.450> this<00:02:49.930> game

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
idea of how ridiculously easy this game

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.720 
idea of how ridiculously easy this game
is<00:02:50.609> it's<00:02:51.609> just<00:02:51.670> not<00:02:51.970> tough<00:02:52.180> at<00:02:52.329> all<00:02:52.450> and<00:02:52.720> I

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
is it's just not tough at all and I

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.399 
is it's just not tough at all and I
guess<00:02:54.730> if<00:02:54.940> you<00:02:55.090> like<00:02:55.269> really<00:02:55.780> boring<00:02:56.140> stuff

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:56.409 
guess if you like really boring stuff

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:57.960 
guess if you like really boring stuff
that<00:02:56.620> doesn't<00:02:56.799> even<00:02:57.010> challenge<00:02:57.340> you<00:02:57.700> at<00:02:57.819> all

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
that doesn't even challenge you at all

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.930 
that doesn't even challenge you at all
then<00:02:58.629> this<00:02:58.840> could<00:02:59.260> be<00:02:59.409> fun<00:02:59.590> but<00:02:59.940> otherwise

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
then this could be fun but otherwise

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.229 
then this could be fun but otherwise
it's<00:03:01.690> not<00:03:02.230> really<00:03:02.680> that<00:03:02.859> neat<00:03:03.239> nevertheless

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
it's not really that neat nevertheless

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.839 
it's not really that neat nevertheless
