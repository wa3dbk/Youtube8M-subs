I've<00:01:07.140> got<00:01:07.320> two<00:01:07.530> keyboards<00:01:08.010> there<00:01:08.220> you<00:01:08.549> can

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
I've got two keyboards there you can

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.580 
I've got two keyboards there you can
also<00:01:08.729> edit<00:01:09.030> these<00:01:09.630> keyboards<00:01:10.110> ago<00:01:10.260> could<00:01:10.470> get

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
also edit these keyboards ago could get

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.560 
also edit these keyboards ago could get
rid<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:10.770> emoji<00:01:11.070> or<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:11.970> can<00:01:12.060> actually<00:01:12.180> reorder

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
rid of emoji or you can actually reorder

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.539 
rid of emoji or you can actually reorder
them<00:01:12.930> so<00:01:13.200> basically<00:01:13.500> emoji<00:01:14.130> will<00:01:14.250> be<00:01:14.369> the

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
them so basically emoji will be the

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.450 
them so basically emoji will be the
default<00:01:14.909> keyboard<00:01:15.270> for<00:01:15.600> iOS<00:01:15.960> but<00:01:16.590> I<00:01:16.860> want<00:01:17.250> the

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
default keyboard for iOS but I want the

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.310 
default keyboard for iOS but I want the
normal<00:01:17.880> keyboard<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.630> be<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:19.020> default

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
normal keyboard to be the default

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.770 
normal keyboard to be the default
keyboard<00:01:19.860> for<00:01:20.280> iOS<00:01:20.820> because<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:21.540> would<00:01:21.659> be

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
keyboard for iOS because that would be

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.810 
keyboard for iOS because that would be
very<00:01:22.110> confusing<00:01:22.470> so<00:01:23.070> now<00:01:23.220> we<00:01:23.280> just<00:01:23.460> want<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.729> go

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
very confusing so now we just want to go

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.969 
very confusing so now we just want to go
back<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.360> your<00:01:24.509> home<00:01:24.689> screen<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:25.500> has<00:01:25.530> been

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
back to your home screen it has been

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.249 
back to your home screen it has been
enabled<00:01:26.340> at<00:01:26.729> this<00:01:27.000> point<00:01:27.270> so<00:01:27.840> basically<00:01:27.869> you

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
enabled at this point so basically you

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.170 
enabled at this point so basically you
can<00:01:28.320> go<00:01:28.500> into<00:01:28.890> anywhere<00:01:29.310> say<00:01:29.549> Twitter<00:01:29.909> for

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
can go into anywhere say Twitter for

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
here so you want to just to go and click

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.719

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
on the little globe icon on the bottom

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.460 
on the little globe icon on the bottom
