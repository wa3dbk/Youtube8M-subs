00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.520
 Paris 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.880
 hi to all gamers 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.700
 today we find ourselves for a small 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.830
 tutorial the screenshots so on bo 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.270
 two uncles and richardson on bo two 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.430
 are harder still than without 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.860
 news of them because that's it's 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.450
 different the snap are different but 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.860
 I will still show you a little 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:29.020
 trip is simple to do 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:32.490
 but just as beautiful to watch so on 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:35.110
 this class I placed snipers 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.640
 way to make the double triangles the 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.560
 double triangles much more pretty 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.009
 so we really see it's the front 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.930
 of the sun rising and I added if 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:48.009
 looters are finally very good 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:50.530
 concludes the ond aulas like that so that's it 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.840
 so we have to do with that with 7 with 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.060
 this class the tricks is really 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.840
 friendly so the one I'm going to you 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:02.170
 present and the simple to realize 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.850
 just by jumping finally 3 6 on 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.440
 recharge and we have the red change 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.800
 in double traction 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.800
 it gives 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.360
 here is a parade it's always 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.580
 all pretty to watch 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.640
 So here to realize this trick shots 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.870
 the simplest is to play in class 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.640
 what is it playing closed all 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.070
 simply put the index finger on triangle 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:29.740
 for playstation players on 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:32.570
 playstation and the finger of honor on r1 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.520
 so it's a bit weird 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:38.890
 at first we never played like that 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.890
 but it's really easier in the end 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.410
 really see what's going on 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:47.750
 quickly 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.750
 so I can try that day enter 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:54.030
 we will finish if we wish by a 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.030
 titanic 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:02.170
 you see we're really full of 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:04.739
 opportunities to fill up full 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.739
 lots of things 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:12.430
 we can also close in 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.410
 air while making 3.6 of course 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:19.470
 always a flash coop and the night with 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:21.250
 double triangles that gives one missed 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.760
 not always happen 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.760
 Which give 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.860
 really see full possibilities for 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.880
 do with good electric shock there I 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.810
 will not show you because we have to 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:37.180
 class thing really do for 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.860
 really do with 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.660
 you see that 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:46.230
 in question it's difficult at first but 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:46.230
 we get used to boats very quickly 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:55.260
 do not hop here from back to school a few 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.260
 I am patient 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.970
 thank you 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:05.650
 really see the fact of putting 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:06.010
 looters it slows the change 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.850
 weapon 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:12.410
 what he does 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:15.430
 very young he had also blocked it's 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.430
 the problem of desire 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:28.250
 good short we do not know how to show 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:31.010
 this time not so bad that's like 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.510
 that's it's done here I hope you 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.669
 will understand a little basics 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:37.220
 uncertain simply suffix to 1 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:38.990
 362 reload of the night in vain doubles 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.750
 triangles and end up with a news cop or 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.830
 do not dare to co-opt titanic as you want 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.300
 start with this trick shots is 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.680
 really simple to do 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.270
 when we are always used this is 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.389
 not especially we start playing a closed 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:52.940
 it's not always easy but there you go 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:54.110
 good I tell you very soon forget 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.330
 no knives and go see my page 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.310
 facebook to also have my other 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.700
 videos and I'll see you soon 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.700
 bailly
