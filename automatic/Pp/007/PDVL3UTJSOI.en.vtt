to<00:00:30.179> back<00:00:30.359> out<00:00:30.630> at<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.810> timer<00:00:31.109> function<00:00:31.579> so

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
to back out at the timer function so

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.069 
to back out at the timer function so
let's<00:00:32.700> take<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:32.910> quick<00:00:33.239> look<00:00:33.420> at<00:00:33.600> how<00:00:33.750> this<00:00:33.930> is

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
let's take a quick look at how this is

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.080 
let's take a quick look at how this is
done<00:00:34.290> so<00:00:34.590> first<00:00:34.890> your<00:00:35.250> display<00:00:35.579> will<00:00:35.760> probably

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
done so first your display will probably

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.750 
done so first your display will probably
not<00:00:36.239> be<00:00:36.270> on<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:37.100> then<00:00:38.100> you'll<00:00:38.309> hit<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.640> round

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
not be on and then you'll hit the round

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.959 
not be on and then you'll hit the round
button<00:00:39.410> display<00:00:40.410> turns<00:00:40.680> on<00:00:41.010> should<00:00:41.640> I<00:00:41.700> get<00:00:41.850> an

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
button display turns on should I get an

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.310 
button display turns on should I get an
angle<00:00:42.300> where<00:00:42.420> you<00:00:42.450> can<00:00:42.629> actually<00:00:42.780> see<00:00:43.140> what's

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
angle where you can actually see what's

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:57.290 
angle where you can actually see what's
going<00:00:43.379> on<00:00:43.680> on<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.980> light

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
you can do what I did here just in case

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.230 
you can do what I did here just in case
and<00:02:31.200> what<00:02:31.319> I<00:02:31.349> did<00:02:31.590> is<00:02:32.280> I<00:02:32.430> have<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:32.730> lights<00:02:32.910> turn

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
and what I did is I have the lights turn

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.089 
and what I did is I have the lights turn
off<00:02:33.480> in<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:33.720> middle<00:02:33.900> of<00:02:33.959> the<00:02:34.050> day<00:02:34.170> for<00:02:34.230> for<00:02:34.860> one

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
off in the middle of the day for for one

off in the middle of the day for for one
minute

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
minute

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.020 
minute
actually<00:02:36.750> this<00:02:36.870> is<00:02:37.050> several<00:02:37.349> there<00:02:37.530> we<00:02:37.650> go<00:02:38.030> so

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
actually this is several there we go so

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.510 
actually this is several there we go so
basically<00:02:39.620> that<00:02:40.620> way<00:02:40.709> I'm<00:02:40.800> using<00:02:40.950> all<00:02:41.250> four

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
basically that way I'm using all four

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.199 
basically that way I'm using all four
steps<00:02:42.920> now<00:02:43.920> it's<00:02:44.099> on<00:02:44.280> again<00:02:44.310> so<00:02:44.790> it'll<00:02:45.000> turn<00:02:45.150> on

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
steps now it's on again so it'll turn on

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.410 
steps now it's on again so it'll turn on
at<00:02:45.480> ten<00:02:45.720> turns<00:02:46.110> off<00:02:46.410> at<00:02:46.620> 159<00:02:47.370> turns<00:02:47.760> back<00:02:48.060> on<00:02:48.090> it

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
at ten turns off at 159 turns back on it

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.630 
at ten turns off at 159 turns back on it
too<00:02:48.599> and<00:02:49.020> turns<00:02:49.530> off<00:02:49.770> at<00:02:49.950> nine<00:02:50.160> o'clock<00:02:50.490> at

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
hit the round key go to the next light

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.990 
hit the round key go to the next light
and<00:02:55.020> now<00:02:55.800> again<00:02:56.010> you're<00:02:56.280> gonna<00:02:56.370> program<00:02:56.849> it

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
and now again you're gonna program it

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.580 
and now again you're gonna program it
the<00:02:57.120> same<00:02:57.360> way<00:02:57.569> you<00:02:57.840> can<00:02:57.930> see<00:02:58.050> here<00:02:58.319> that<00:02:58.470> the

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.200 
funny so I just went ahead and put a 1
minute<00:03:12.440> gap<00:03:12.710> and<00:03:12.950> I<00:03:13.010> staggered<00:03:13.520> the<00:03:14.060> one

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:14.210 
minute gap and I staggered the one

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.360 
minute gap and I staggered the one
minute<00:03:14.480> gaps<00:03:14.660> per<00:03:15.050> channel<00:03:15.410> so<00:03:15.770> that<00:03:15.980> they

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
minute gaps per channel so that they

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:17.800 
minute gaps per channel so that they
weren't<00:03:16.520> all<00:03:16.670> off<00:03:16.880> at<00:03:17.060> the<00:03:17.150> same<00:03:17.360> time<00:03:17.600> and<00:03:17.750> it

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
ramp sort of I don't run any moon lights

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.160 
ramp sort of I don't run any moon lights
overnight<00:03:46.580> for<00:03:47.180> a<00:03:47.210> couple<00:03:47.450> reasons<00:03:47.480> but<00:03:47.930> one

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
overnight for a couple reasons but one

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.340 
overnight for a couple reasons but one
is<00:03:48.200> they're<00:03:48.950> just<00:03:49.190> way<00:03:49.370> too<00:03:49.430> bright<00:03:49.840> with<00:03:50.840> just

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
is they're just way too bright with just

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.590 
is they're just way too bright with just
the<00:03:52.130> moon<00:03:52.340> lights<00:03:52.580> on<00:03:52.790> you<00:03:53.000> can<00:03:53.150> see<00:03:53.390> you've

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
the moon lights on you can see you've

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.440 
the moon lights on you can see you've
still<00:03:53.780> got<00:03:53.960> a<00:03:53.990> ton<00:03:54.440> of<00:03:54.710> light<00:03:55.640> and<00:03:56.000> coral

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
still got a ton of light and coral

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.080 
still got a ton of light and coral
fluorescence<00:03:57.080> and<00:03:57.500> your<00:03:58.430> corals<00:03:58.790> do<00:03:58.880> need<00:03:59.060> a

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
fluorescence and your corals do need a

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.060 
fluorescence and your corals do need a
little<00:03:59.180> bit<00:03:59.330> of<00:03:59.510> time<00:03:59.690> at<00:03:59.840> night<00:03:59.960> to<00:04:00.200> respirate

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070 
little bit of time at night to respirate

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.810 
little bit of time at night to respirate
to<00:04:01.510> you<00:04:02.510> know<00:04:02.600> relax<00:04:02.900> so<00:04:03.290> I<00:04:03.980> felt<00:04:04.550> that<00:04:04.610> the

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
to you know relax so I felt that the

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.220 
to you know relax so I felt that the
moon<00:04:04.940> lights<00:04:05.150> were<00:04:05.300> too<00:04:05.450> bright<00:04:05.690> certainly<00:04:06.170> if

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
moon lights were too bright certainly if

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:07.630 
moon lights were too bright certainly if
you<00:04:06.320> want<00:04:06.500> to<00:04:06.560> run<00:04:06.710> them<00:04:06.800> till<00:04:07.010> midnight<00:04:07.280> or

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
you want to run them till midnight or

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.850 
you want to run them till midnight or
whatever<00:04:07.910> time<00:04:08.180> you're<00:04:08.360> you're<00:04:09.050> cut<00:04:09.590> loose

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
whatever time you're you're cut loose

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.440 
whatever time you're you're cut loose
for<00:04:10.040> the<00:04:10.190> night<00:04:10.580> to<00:04:10.700> go<00:04:10.790> to<00:04:10.850> bed<00:04:11.090> you<00:04:11.360> know

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
for the night to go to bed you know

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:12.790 
for the night to go to bed you know
probably<00:04:11.750> wouldn't<00:04:12.050> hurt<00:04:12.200> but<00:04:12.410> they<00:04:12.500> do<00:04:12.560> need

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:12.800 
probably wouldn't hurt but they do need

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.550 
probably wouldn't hurt but they do need
at<00:04:12.950> least<00:04:12.980> six<00:04:13.430> hours<00:04:13.580> maybe<00:04:14.090> eight<00:04:14.360> of<00:04:14.630> a<00:04:15.350> time

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
at least six hours maybe eight of a time

with no light to to chill out so I just

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.170 
with no light to to chill out so I just
use<00:04:18.440> mine<00:04:18.650> as<00:04:18.830> a<00:04:18.859> three<00:04:19.130> stage<00:04:19.370> ramp<00:04:19.640> plus<00:04:19.940> I

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
use mine as a three stage ramp plus I

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.330 
use mine as a three stage ramp plus I
really<00:04:20.330> like<00:04:20.570> the<00:04:20.720> way<00:04:20.870> the<00:04:21.470> four<00:04:21.680> 20s<00:04:22.100> make

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.430 
really like the way the four 20s make
the<00:04:22.430> corals<00:04:22.760> glow<00:04:22.970> during<00:04:23.420> the<00:04:23.780> day<00:04:23.960> and
