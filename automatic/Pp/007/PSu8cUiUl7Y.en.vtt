00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.160 
because we're using a lot of portobello
mushrooms<00:01:41.880> this<00:01:42.030> time<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.570> they<00:01:42.659> steep<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:43.020> lot

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
mushrooms this time and they steep a lot

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.260 
mushrooms this time and they steep a lot
of<00:01:43.320> water<00:01:43.530> so<00:01:44.220> this<00:01:44.369> will<00:01:44.549> actually<00:01:44.700> absorb

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
of water so this will actually absorb

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.420 
of water so this will actually absorb
that<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.869> what<00:01:46.530> I've<00:01:46.619> got<00:01:46.649> in<00:01:46.890> my<00:01:47.009> pan<00:01:47.250> is<00:01:47.399> just
