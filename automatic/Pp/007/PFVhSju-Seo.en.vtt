00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:11.039
 From the director who wants to watch the world explode 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.719
 and studies that allow him to do so 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.162
 the dumbest and most incoherent movie in the Transformers series is coming ... 

00:00:17.163 --> 00:00:20.233
 what really tells us a lot. 

00:00:20.234 --> 00:00:24.868
 Did he ... hit the guy by car? 

00:00:24.868 --> 00:00:27.689
 Transformers: Age of Doom. 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.879
 Prepare for a completely new series discovery, 

00:00:30.884 --> 00:00:32.279
 with a completely new cast 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:33.530
 all new enemies, 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.859
 and awesome new allies 

00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:39.947
 just to end up in the same lengthy piece of shit where else 

00:00:39.948 --> 00:00:40.994
 we will not have 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.840
 concepts 

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:45.279
 What 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:48.019
 happens. 

00:00:48.509 --> 00:00:51.710
 "Oh my Boooz!" 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.420
 If Michael Bay, can repeat the shot, we can repeat the jokes about the film. 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:03.280
 Shia Laboeuf is gone, and neither you nor Bumblebee or Optimus Prime will care 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.409
 where to divide. 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.870
 Instead, we'll get an American Texan named Cade Yeager. 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.530
 A guest doing everything to sound intelligently. 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.329
 This is a Simplex movie projector. very rare. " 

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:17.159
 "who taught you solder? I did it, that's what I'm doing!" 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.539
 And he is an inventor. 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.109
 "I know you have a conscience, because you are an inventor, like me." 

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:22.450
 "I have to patent it!" 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.000
 "Some things should not be invented." 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.109
 "This is what the best inventors are doing." 

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:27.719
 "I am an inventor, this may be my chance. 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.639
 If I know their technology, we will not worry about money! " 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.150
 You are an inventor. We caught it. 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.329
 In a series that is known for young hot women, 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:40.590
 get ready for something smaller 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.280
 where the hot film girl is a minor 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.849
 "honey, your shorts are getting shorter" 

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:49.379
 where her boyfriend is an adult and will literally stop the movie 

00:01:49.383 --> 00:01:51.583
 to explain why they can make a mistake 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.870
 "This is a 17-year-old girl, how old are you?" 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:55.189
 "20." 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:56.149
 "She is a minor." 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.260
 "We are protected by Romeo and Juliet's law." 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
 "We met when I was in my second year. 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:02.298
 "Not at all." 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:07.929
 "We are under juvenile law, Act 2705-3." 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.909
 If only they put in so much effort to justify the plot of what 

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:13.919
 they did to justify sex with a minor. 

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:18.589
 The transformers are back and are finished with these movies like us. 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.900
 "This is not our fight! We're leaving from here!" 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.698
 "See you, for now." 

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:24.560
 Particularly Optimus Prime. 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.138
 "We have finished defending humanity." 

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:29.409
 "Autobots, we're done." 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:33.524
 Watch the biggest feast produced by Michael Bay 

00:02:33.527 --> 00:02:34.527
 who is so lazy ... 

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:37.310
 that he did not even fix those green monitors. 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.689
 going from day to night it would be a day again. 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:42.500
 and left the Sears Tower visible in the background 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.449
 in HONG KONGU. 

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:48.069
 Prepare for the next sequel that you hoped would be better 

00:02:48.078 --> 00:02:51.149
 but instead, you'll get exactly the same 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.639
 having more 

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:54.699
 unrealistic explosions 

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:57.299
 interspersed hilarious jokes 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.849
 during an endless sunset 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:04.039
 near the American flags. 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.240
 Listen, why not write the rest of this trailer in Chinese? 

00:03:12.353 --> 00:03:14.453
 Thank you, great American foreboding voice. 

00:03:14.477 --> 00:03:17.277
 Exactly like in the movie, 

00:03:18.002 --> 00:03:20.101
 Third and last part of this Honorable One. 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.025
 He will satisfy the Chinese audience 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.149
 in order to increase its international attractiveness 

00:03:24.786 --> 00:03:25.073
 What? 

00:03:25.798 --> 00:03:28.997
 So watch as Micheal Bay shamelessly hitting us ... 

00:03:29.491 --> 00:03:31.794
 transfers shares to China for no reason. 

00:03:33.253 --> 00:03:36.390
 Presenting all the Chinese people as strong and heroic people 

00:03:36.391 --> 00:03:39.360
 Creating from the Chinese women, the action film heroine ... 

00:03:39.365 --> 00:03:43.111
 and showing the communist parties as effective and decisive 

00:03:43.822 --> 00:03:45.322
 "We must call our government to help us" 

00:03:45.331 --> 00:03:48.479
 Because now the Americans are making up for Micheal Bay's nonsense 

00:03:48.503 --> 00:03:50.624
 he decided to make a movie for us. 

00:03:50.648 --> 00:03:53.518
 It's all your fault, American pigs! 

00:03:53.542 --> 00:03:55.898
