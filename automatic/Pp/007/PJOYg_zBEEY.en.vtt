 astroscope laboratory i'm victor leonid 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.100
 choosing quality and reliable binoculars 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.490
 we sometimes don't attach much importance 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.949
 its lightness and compactness these two 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.769
 characteristics sometimes at the expense of 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.349
 another is a sign of product class 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.920
 the only thing worth paying here 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.870
 attention so much to the quality of performance 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:36.510
 in our review we will help to meet 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.079
 you closer with such binoculars from the company

 feel it hard but at the same time and very 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.140
 durable however the manufacturer took care 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.520
 about the comfort of users and in the area 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.950

 categories water proof rough 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.050
 the surface keeps the binoculars from slipping 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.590
 out of hand and reliably protect from moisture not 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.840

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:20.580
 its center of gravity is shifted to the eyepiece this 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.959
 due to the aluminum part of the body 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.420

 Binoculars are made according to the access por-ra scheme 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.330
 I will not let go very easily 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.870
 Binoculars has focus on the central 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.760
 axes 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.459
 she carried rubberized 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.299
 wheel that rotates tight but 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.430
 however, has no backlash 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:21.280
 minimum focusing distance 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:23.769
 is 5 meters on the right eyepiece 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.390
 there is a plastic wheel for 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:28.540
 diopter correction 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.970
 comfortable overhangs to rotate will help you 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.069
 select the desired value in the range of 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:37.129
 minus 4 to plus four diopters 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:41.180
 between points distance for this model 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:44.109

 optics namely application 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.599
 ecological glass and like an eye which 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:05.569
 does not contain 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:07.819
 lead and arsenic eyepieces ophthalmic 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:10.010
 lenses are made on wide angle 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:13.639
 they have a quality scheme 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:16.160
 enlightenment blue except this in 

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:18.769
 cooler design included aspherical 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.949
 elements that eliminate distortion in 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:24.860
 image at the edge of the field of view of the eyepieces 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:27.070
 binoculars have plastic eye flaps with 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.479
 adjustable in 3 positions 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.759
 the output of binoculars is perfect 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:34.820
 round shape has a diameter 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:37.789
 5 millimeters takeaway pupil is 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.789
 12 millimeters and ensure sufficient 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:41.990
 comfort of observation 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:43.220
 binocular image 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.650
 is natural 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:48.050
 does not wear color distortion box 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:50.389
 image of the device with high quality and 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:53.419
 whole diameter due to the application 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:55.909
 aspherical elements can be said 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:58.940
 managed to get rid of one hundred percent 

00:04:55.909 --> 00:05:01.300
 the curvature of the field also increases 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.770
 sharpness and contrast pictures 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.810
 I want to note very well 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.800
 corrected chromatism he becomes 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.039
 noticeable 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:12.320
 only in very bright conditions 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:15.139
 where the boundaries of the objects of observation are 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:18.550
 high contrast at the very edge of the field 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:21.889
 subtle astigmatism is present 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:25.400
 image brightness is the same throughout 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:28.610
 field except perhaps very thin 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.260
 stripes on the very edge of the binoculars 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:33.170
 has a field of view 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:36.110
 which is 114 meters on 

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:38.510
 kilometer is six half degrees 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:41.150
 gross gross equivalent 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:44.210
 evening time recommended binoculars 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:49.640
 good but bright 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:51.980
 this model summing up I want 

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:53.300
 note the high quality of performance 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:56.360
 binocular mechanics 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:58.550
 covering robert m categories vater proof 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:01.100
 will protect your binoculars like 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.840
 short-term immersion in water and 

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:05.180
 with shocks and blows small 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:08.480
 amplitude this model is fine 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:11.810
 suitable for hunting, fishing and tourism 

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:14.050
 day and twilight time however 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:16.300
 exit pupil of 5 millimeters not 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:18.250
 has to full night 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:20.900
 astronomical observations 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:23.330
 worth noting the fact that the application 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.050
 glass and both eye and aspheric 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.750
 items 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:30.380
 allows you to get a clear contrast 

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:32.060
 image across the image field with 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:33.200
 You had a technical review from 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:38.030
 astroscope labs 

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:40.030
 see you soon in our store 

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:40.030
