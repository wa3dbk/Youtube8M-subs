hopefully some software companies follow
this<00:00:30.110> I<00:00:30.259> mean<00:00:30.380> patents<00:00:31.009> are<00:00:31.790> the<00:00:32.180> idea<00:00:32.809> of<00:00:32.989> them

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
this I mean patents are the idea of them

is a good idea they're here to help us

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.770 
is a good idea they're here to help us
create<00:00:36.789> technology<00:00:37.789> but<00:00:37.910> I<00:00:37.940> think<00:00:38.149> Elon<00:00:38.480> Musk

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
create technology but I think Elon Musk

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.079 
create technology but I think Elon Musk
and<00:00:39.019> the<00:00:39.410> group<00:00:39.620> at<00:00:39.859> Tesla<00:00:40.340> are<00:00:40.760> really<00:00:40.940> taking

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:41.089 
and the group at Tesla are really taking

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:42.819 
and the group at Tesla are really taking
things<00:00:41.359> to<00:00:41.480> the<00:00:41.539> next<00:00:41.600> level<00:00:41.839> by<00:00:42.230> making<00:00:42.589> this

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
things to the next level by making this

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:44.529

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:51.289 
their hat UNS they won't sue as long as

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:53.829 
their hat UNS they won't sue as long as
there<00:00:52.160> were<00:00:52.280> some<00:00:52.429> conditions<00:00:52.850> if<00:00:53.149> they<00:00:53.570> can't

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:53.839 
there were some conditions if they can't

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:55.869 
there were some conditions if they can't
copy<00:00:54.140> the<00:00:54.350> car<00:00:54.559> you<00:00:54.949> can't<00:00:55.249> make<00:00:55.399> the<00:00:55.579> exact

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
copy the car you can't make the exact

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:58.180 
copy the car you can't make the exact
same<00:00:56.059> looking<00:00:56.690> car<00:00:56.989> but<00:00:57.559> you<00:00:57.649> can<00:00:57.829> take<00:00:57.980> the

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
same looking car but you can take the

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.189 
same looking car but you can take the
technology<00:00:58.940> that<00:00:58.969> Tesla<00:00:59.449> has<00:00:59.600> developed<00:01:00.019> in

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
technology that Tesla has developed in

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:03.729 
technology that Tesla has developed in
the<00:01:00.730> electric<00:01:01.730> car<00:01:01.879> arena<00:01:02.239> and<00:01:02.929> and<00:01:03.350> put<00:01:03.589> that

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
the electric car arena and and put that

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.670 
the electric car arena and and put that
into<00:01:03.800> your<00:01:04.100> own<00:01:04.489> car<00:01:05.420> design<00:01:05.810> and<00:01:06.260> move

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
into your own car design and move

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.740 
into your own car design and move
forward<00:01:06.920> so<00:01:07.280> I<00:01:07.310> was<00:01:07.670> kind<00:01:07.759> of<00:01:07.850> my<00:01:08.540> gears

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
forward so I was kind of my gears

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:09.999 
forward so I was kind of my gears
returning<00:01:09.259> and<00:01:09.439> I<00:01:09.470> was<00:01:09.560> thinking<00:01:09.829> you<00:01:09.979> know

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:10.009 
returning and I was thinking you know

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:12.010 
returning and I was thinking you know
why<00:01:10.340> what's<00:01:10.700> the<00:01:10.790> motivation<00:01:11.149> for<00:01:11.390> this<00:01:11.689> right

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
why what's the motivation for this right

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.770 
why what's the motivation for this right
and<00:01:12.290> I<00:01:12.409> was<00:01:12.439> thinking<00:01:12.860> about<00:01:13.659> Epic<00:01:14.659> Games

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
and I was thinking about Epic Games

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.340 
and I was thinking about Epic Games
which<00:01:15.290> is<00:01:15.439> a<00:01:15.470> game<00:01:15.950> studio<00:01:16.460> who<00:01:17.329> also<00:01:17.630> does

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
which is a game studio who also does

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.069 
which is a game studio who also does
gain<00:01:19.100> engine<00:01:19.520> technology<00:01:20.060> now<00:01:20.210> a<00:01:20.240> game<00:01:20.869> engine

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:21.079 
gain engine technology now a game engine

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:23.410 
gain engine technology now a game engine
is<00:01:21.530> kind<00:01:22.189> of<00:01:22.250> all<00:01:22.399> of<00:01:22.520> the<00:01:22.610> pieces<00:01:22.880> that<00:01:23.090> make<00:01:23.360> a

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
is kind of all of the pieces that make a

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.230 
is kind of all of the pieces that make a
game<00:01:23.750> a<00:01:23.780> lot<00:01:24.259> of<00:01:24.439> you<00:01:24.530> know<00:01:24.560> that<00:01:25.340> the<00:01:25.909> Unreal

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
game a lot of you know that the Unreal

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.550 
game a lot of you know that the Unreal
Engine<00:01:26.420> and<00:01:26.750> that's<00:01:26.869> that's<00:01:27.110> what<00:01:27.290> I<00:01:27.380> pick

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
Engine and that's that's what I pick

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.020 
Engine and that's that's what I pick
made<00:01:27.710> so<00:01:27.829> I<00:01:27.860> thought<00:01:28.009> okay<00:01:28.670> well<00:01:28.850> maybe

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
made so I thought okay well maybe

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.550 
made so I thought okay well maybe
they're<00:01:29.270> following<00:01:29.570> the<00:01:29.719> same<00:01:29.899> model<00:01:30.259> that

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
they're following the same model that

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.260 
they're following the same model that
that<00:01:30.829> that<00:01:31.159> they<00:01:31.399> did<00:01:31.640> and<00:01:31.820> I<00:01:31.880> think<00:01:32.030> they<00:01:32.119> kind

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
that that they did and I think they kind

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.240 
that that they did and I think they kind
of<00:01:32.360> stumbled<00:01:32.659> into<00:01:32.780> it<00:01:32.930> so<00:01:33.049> they<00:01:33.170> made<00:01:33.469> the

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
of stumbled into it so they made the

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.670 
of stumbled into it so they made the
game<00:01:34.479> unreal<00:01:35.479> yeah<00:01:35.840> right<00:01:36.020> which<00:01:36.170> was<00:01:36.350> a<00:01:36.380> huge

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
game unreal yeah right which was a huge

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.350 
game unreal yeah right which was a huge
hit<00:01:37.009> yeah<00:01:37.340> and<00:01:37.490> then<00:01:37.820> that<00:01:37.969> made<00:01:38.119> everybody

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
hit yeah and then that made everybody

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.389 
hit yeah and then that made everybody
else<00:01:38.689> want<00:01:39.110> to<00:01:39.350> use<00:01:39.649> their<00:01:39.950> game<00:01:40.130> engine

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 
else want to use their game engine

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:42.370 
else want to use their game engine
technology<00:01:40.909> which<00:01:41.149> launched<00:01:41.750> their<00:01:42.200> game

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
technology which launched their game

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.350 
technology which launched their game
engine<00:01:42.710> business<00:01:43.219> so<00:01:43.520> obviously<00:01:44.000> the<00:01:44.210> same

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
engine business so obviously the same

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.510 
engine business so obviously the same
idea<00:01:44.630> here<00:01:44.659> is<00:01:44.840> they<00:01:45.439> had<00:01:45.799> this<00:01:45.920> huge<00:01:46.130> hit<00:01:46.490> with

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
idea here is they had this huge hit with

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.020 
idea here is they had this huge hit with
this<00:01:46.820> car<00:01:47.119> to<00:01:47.780> make<00:01:47.869> underlying<00:01:48.439> um<00:01:49.030> electric
