it's<00:00:32.270> kind<00:00:32.450> of<00:00:32.480> a<00:00:32.570> throwback<00:00:32.719> to<00:00:32.960> that<00:00:33.200> game

00:00:33.369 --> 00:00:33.379 
it's kind of a throwback to that game

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:35.290 
it's kind of a throwback to that game
but<00:00:34.010> one<00:00:34.190> thing<00:00:34.370> notable<00:00:34.760> about<00:00:34.910> that<00:00:35.120> game

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
but one thing notable about that game

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.160 
but one thing notable about that game
that<00:00:36.100> completely<00:00:37.100> blows<00:00:37.730> my<00:00:38.660> mind<00:00:38.899> that<00:00:38.989> they

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
that completely blows my mind that they

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.290 
that completely blows my mind that they
managed<00:00:39.440> to<00:00:39.469> pull<00:00:39.710> this<00:00:39.829> off<00:00:40.039> is<00:00:40.750> that<00:00:42.100> if<00:00:43.300> you

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
managed to pull this off is that if you

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.540 
managed to pull this off is that if you
play<00:00:44.600> reigns<00:00:44.960> of<00:00:45.140> power<00:00:45.170> and<00:00:45.710> you<00:00:46.010> hold<00:00:46.250> down<00:00:46.489> a

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:15.439 
every single one of them somehow they

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:17.590 
every single one of them somehow they
got<00:01:15.469> this<00:01:15.799> past<00:01:16.039> the<00:01:16.189> censors<00:01:16.509> probably<00:01:17.509> the

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
got this past the censors probably the

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.669 
got this past the censors probably the
fact<00:01:17.840> that<00:01:17.959> you<00:01:18.109> have<00:01:18.259> to<00:01:18.380> hold<00:01:18.469> down<00:01:18.649> a

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
fucking completely insane button

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.840 
fucking completely insane button
combination<00:01:20.959> i<00:01:21.020> think<00:01:21.200> it's<00:01:21.289> like<00:01:21.399> ABC<00:01:22.399> start

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
combination i think it's like ABC start

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.719 
combination i think it's like ABC start
up<00:01:23.060> right<00:01:23.810> or<00:01:24.109> some<00:01:24.649> bullshit<00:01:25.039> on<00:01:25.249> the<00:01:25.399> second

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
up right or some bullshit on the second

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:27.669 
up right or some bullshit on the second

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
fucking basically have to roll through

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:56.060 
fucking basically have to roll through
the<00:01:49.920> Rings<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.310> keep<00:01:50.430> your<00:01:50.580> speed<00:01:50.760> going<00:01:55.070> if

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
the Rings to keep your speed going if

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.560 
the Rings to keep your speed going if
you<00:01:56.250> time<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.490> right<00:01:56.640> then<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.120> get<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.360> speed

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
you time it right then you get the speed

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:58.730 
you time it right then you get the speed
boost<00:01:57.780> if<00:01:57.900> you<00:01:57.990> don't<00:01:58.140> time<00:01:58.380> it<00:01:58.470> right<00:01:58.560> where

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
boost if you don't time it right where

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:59.540 
boost if you don't time it right where
you<00:01:58.800> roll<00:01:58.979> right<00:01:59.100> through<00:01:59.160> and<00:01:59.369> you<00:01:59.430> go

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
you roll right through and you go

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:00.620 
you roll right through and you go
through<00:01:59.729> it<00:01:59.850> then<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.119> don't<00:02:00.150> get<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.450> speed

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
through it then you don't get to speed

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
through it then you don't get to speed
boost<00:02:02.180> yeah<00:02:03.180> I<00:02:03.300> like<00:02:03.930> if<00:02:04.110> you<00:02:04.229> consider<00:02:04.560> the

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
boost yeah I like if you consider the

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.320 
boost yeah I like if you consider the
censorship<00:02:04.950> of<00:02:05.220> the<00:02:05.310> day<00:02:05.490> where<00:02:06.000> people<00:02:06.240> were
