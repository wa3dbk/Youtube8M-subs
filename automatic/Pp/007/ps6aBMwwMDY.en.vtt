00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.040
 pack to see what is a little 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.250

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.590
 let's take a moment to install the 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.160
 this device we read the 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:26.329

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:29.700
 the device is this one that is of color 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:34.709

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:38.030
 we are going to remove the film and to 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.030
 install the battery 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.230
 obviously device that is not a 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.519
 monocoque then the shell opens 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:49.530
 removable the entrance for the sim 1 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.389

 the sim reminder on the battery and 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:07.049
 let's try to see if it really turns on 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.480
 minimum thickness for this device e 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:11.400
 it is also very very light afterwards 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.170
 having put on the battery we make a 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.370
 quick tour 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.819
 here we have the power button 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.819

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:25.439
 volume rocker at the top instead 

00:03:22.499 --> 00:03:28.079
 micro usb port with 3 mm jack and a half 

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:30.329
