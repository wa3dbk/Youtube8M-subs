00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.139 
now on YouTube so I'm just going to
explain<00:00:42.059> this<00:00:42.450> server<00:00:43.640> don't<00:00:44.640> mind<00:00:44.850> the

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
explain this server don't mind the

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.889 
explain this server don't mind the
random<00:00:45.870> movements<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.770> video<00:00:47.270> because<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.780> you

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
random movements the video because I you

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.889 
random movements the video because I you
recorded<00:00:49.860> this<00:00:49.980> using<00:00:50.430> upload<00:00:50.879> studio<00:00:51.510> and

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
recorded this using upload studio and

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.410 
recorded this using upload studio and
stuff<00:00:52.170> so<00:00:53.100> I<00:00:53.129> had<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.640> overlay<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.120> voice

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
stuff so I had to overlay the voice

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.930 
stuff so I had to overlay the voice
after<00:00:54.989> I've<00:00:55.079> recorded<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.770> so<00:00:55.920> it's<00:00:56.730> kind<00:00:56.910> of

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
after I've recorded it so it's kind of

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.069 
after I've recorded it so it's kind of
off<00:00:57.710> anyways<00:00:58.710> I<00:00:59.100> got<00:00:59.910> about<00:01:00.090> ten<00:01:00.420> games<00:01:00.719> in<00:01:00.960> the

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
basically it's like a PC sort of server

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.010 
basically it's like a PC sort of server
I<00:01:46.829> try<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.549> get<00:01:47.759> as<00:01:47.850> close<00:01:48.060> as<00:01:48.299> I<00:01:48.450> possibly

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
I try to get as close as I possibly

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.700 
I try to get as close as I possibly
could<00:01:49.409> -<00:01:50.159> what<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.310> PC<00:01:50.759> server<00:01:51.000> looks<00:01:51.810> like<00:01:52.049> but

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
could - what a PC server looks like but

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.859 
could - what a PC server looks like but
of<00:01:52.799> course<00:01:52.829> we<00:01:53.250> don't<00:01:53.369> have<00:01:53.570> command<00:01:54.570> blocks

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
of course we don't have command blocks

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.109 
of course we don't have command blocks
and

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
and

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.709 
and
you<00:01:56.719> know<00:01:56.840> plugins<00:01:57.409> or<00:01:57.590> nothing<00:01:57.890> so<00:01:58.820> basically

00:01:59.709 --> 00:01:59.719 
you know plugins or nothing so basically

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:05.050 
you know plugins or nothing so basically
I<00:02:00.140> got<00:02:00.350> as<00:02:00.829> close<00:02:01.280> as<00:02:01.609> this<00:02:02.240> is<00:02:02.570> that<00:02:03.670> used<00:02:04.670> you

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
I got as close as this is that used you

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:12.460 
I got as close as this is that used you
uh<00:02:06.729> let's<00:02:07.729> see<00:02:07.880> here<00:02:09.729> so<00:02:10.900> the<00:02:11.900> only<00:02:11.989> problem

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
whatever killing people outside of PvP

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.250 
whatever killing people outside of PvP
rooms<00:02:33.290> and<00:02:34.599> that's<00:02:35.599> pretty<00:02:35.810> much<00:02:36.049> the<00:02:36.230> only

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
rooms and that's pretty much the only

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.229 
rooms and that's pretty much the only
rule<00:02:36.680> in<00:02:36.799> the<00:02:36.890> whole<00:02:37.010> game<00:02:37.220> everything<00:02:38.000> you

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
rule in the whole game everything you

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.059 
rule in the whole game everything you
don't<00:02:38.360> have<00:02:38.569> to<00:02:38.720> build<00:02:38.989> to<00:02:39.260> play<00:02:39.470> any<00:02:39.769> of<00:02:39.950> these

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
don't have to build to play any of these

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:42.250 
don't have to build to play any of these
games<00:02:40.130> so<00:02:41.120> no<00:02:41.420> one's<00:02:41.599> allowed<00:02:41.780> to<00:02:41.959> build<00:02:42.140> in

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
games so no one's allowed to build in

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.600 
games so no one's allowed to build in
the<00:02:42.319> whole<00:02:42.470> game<00:02:42.650> so<00:02:42.890> I<00:02:42.920> have<00:02:43.160> to<00:02:43.280> worry<00:02:43.489> about

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
the whole game so I have to worry about

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:44.880 
the whole game so I have to worry about
griefing<00:02:44.209> or<00:02:44.360> nothing

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
griefing or nothing

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.100 
griefing or nothing
so<00:02:45.890> the<00:02:46.160> only<00:02:46.280> thing<00:02:46.700> I<00:02:47.060> got<00:02:47.510> to<00:02:47.599> do<00:02:47.720> of<00:02:48.049> course

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
so the only thing I got to do of course

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.990 
so the only thing I got to do of course
is<00:02:48.470> make<00:02:48.620> sure<00:02:48.799> people<00:02:49.310> are<00:02:49.400> attacking<00:02:49.760> each

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
is make sure people are attacking each

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.330 
is make sure people are attacking each
other<00:02:50.120> outside<00:02:50.510> the<00:02:50.540> arena's<00:02:50.959> so<00:02:51.799> every<00:02:52.129> game

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
other outside the arena's so every game

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.289 
other outside the arena's so every game
is<00:02:52.610> is<00:02:52.849> fully<00:02:53.500> automatically<00:02:54.500> resettable<00:02:55.299> so

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
is is fully automatically resettable so

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.630 
is is fully automatically resettable so
like<00:02:56.569> I<00:02:56.810> never<00:02:57.170> have<00:02:57.440> to<00:02:57.620> go<00:02:57.769> reset<00:02:58.220> any<00:02:58.459> of

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
like I never have to go reset any of

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.190 
like I never have to go reset any of
them<00:02:58.790> so<00:02:59.060> people<00:02:59.209> can<00:02:59.540> play<00:02:59.720> them<00:02:59.870> they<00:03:00.019> can

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
them so people can play them they can

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.650 
them so people can play them they can
play<00:03:00.350> them<00:03:00.500> continually<00:03:01.160> without<00:03:02.030> stopping

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
play them continually without stopping

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.300 
play them continually without stopping
as<00:03:02.750> much<00:03:02.959> as<00:03:03.139> they<00:03:03.260> want<00:03:03.530> so<00:03:03.829> they<00:03:03.980> have<00:03:04.160> their

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310
