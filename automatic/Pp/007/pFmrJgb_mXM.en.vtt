00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.919
 the facelift or facelift or 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.260
 rhytidectomy is a surgery and effective in 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.960
 face rejuvenation 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.990
 the technique I propose repositioning the 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.590
 facial volumes and flaccid withdrawal 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.779
 reducing wrinkles and furrows is 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.080
 suitable for elderly people 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:28.380
 and great facial aging 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.560
 genetics fire the sun exposure 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.360
 and poor diet are some of the 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.680
 factors that accelerate the 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.620
 aging 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.800
 with age the skin loses part of its 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:45.090
 collagen and elastic fibers becoming 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:48.270
 flaccid wrinkles without shine and softness 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.910
 the deep tissues also suffer from 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.699
 aging and factors such as the action of 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.940
 cause the fat to fall 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.910
 and changes the face shape in the 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.120
 youth the region the voluminous tide 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:06.119
 illuminated the lower eye region is 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.810
 well filled and the mandibular contour 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:12.810
 thus defined the face has a format 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.390
 triangle with apex down 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.600
 already in the aged face it is possible to notice 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.880
 a drop in facial tissues with the 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.850
 displacement of malaria culture in 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.180
 lower eye area loses volume 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:30.439
 form if the known nasolabial juice 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:34.140
 like Chinese mustache the jaw region 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:38.130
 loses its definition and the neck becomes 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.680
 flaccid pre-surgical recommendations 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.200

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:01.979
 ordered laboratory tests some 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.450

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.969

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.640
 tell your doctor the medicines you 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.830
 you use normally because some should 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.040
 be suspended as in the case of 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.019
 anticoagulants on hot days 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.000

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.209
 alcoholic beverages and the fun tells the 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.219
 case of influenza and illness before

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:33.510
 solid and liquid food 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.180
 the time of the hospitalization surgery and the 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.590
 type of anesthesia will be informed by the 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.930

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.939
 work takes place in a few days 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.959
 other specific recommendations 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:51.359
 concerning curative care 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:53.879

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:58.799
 by your doctor according to your case the 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.109
 patience and caring are key 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:03.659
 in the postoperative period 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:06.540
 over a few months you can see 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:08.939
 a more natural and definitive result 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.879
 complications are rare due to 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:14.489
 preparation performed in the preoperative period 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:15.629
 care offered during and after the 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.700
 surgery 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:20.609
 plastic surgery is one of the 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.819
 to gain more self-confidence and 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:26.609

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:28.949
 about your expectations with your doctor and 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:31.680
 I see that it can really be done in your 

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:35.099
 if then perfection does not exist 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:37.519
 but the results are worth it together 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:40.349
 may discuss surgical techniques 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:43.229
 existing and best suited for the 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:45.690
 your case because you must always respect 

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:47.579
 the anatomy of each person 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.720
 there is no plastic surgery without 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:50.400
 scars 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.129
 each person has a process of 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.799
 different healing that does not 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:59.189
 of the doctor but in the organism 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:00.629
 you should seek better results within 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:03.299
 of your reality 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:07.379
 without expecting to look like 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:11.430
 someone famous or that you admire technique 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:14.970
 to the face is constituted by 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:17.759
 layer of fat skin and muscles that 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:20.940
 extend above facial bones 

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:24.840
 Let's see now how the 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:27.270
 The facelift surgery begins with 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.830
 a detachment of facial skin and 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.680
 neck 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:34.129
 South then held repositioning 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:37.879
 of deep tissues and the excess of 

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:40.449
 skin removed in some cases can be 

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:43.099
 the association of liposuction with 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:45.379
 for removing excess fat 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:48.319
 located in the neck 

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:50.599
 the use of a drain may be necessary to 

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:53.030
 the removal of fluids that form 

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:55.219
 below the skin, facilitating the 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.080
 healing and promoting 

00:04:55.219 --> 00:05:00.169
 faster recovery 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.460
 its removal is done on the following days 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:04.520
 procedure 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:07.430
 the size of the scars varies according to 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:10.129
 with the degree of skin flaccidity so 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:13.039
 general is discreet and hidden inside 

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:16.069
 of the hair and around the ears 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:18.229
 the scars mature and stay 

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:20.840
 less visible over time 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:22.279
 It may take a few months for the 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.460
 final result 

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:28.520
 the face lift does not prevent the process 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:31.279
 aging but decreases sagging 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:33.979
 of the skin of the face and neck 

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:34.909
 maintaining a youthful appearance for many 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:38.210
 years 

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:40.639
 post-surgical recommendations is 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:43.699
 advisable rest with bedside 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:46.310
 and use of cold packs for 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:49.129
 decrease the initial swelling 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:51.889
 follow your doctor's advice regarding 

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:54.310
