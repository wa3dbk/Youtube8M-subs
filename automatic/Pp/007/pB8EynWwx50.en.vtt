00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.840
 you start looking for the limit then 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.880
 when 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.880
 when the master of the mallet comes to you 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.420
 how hard is preparing the marathon at 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.880
 end is a day and is what tops you 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.220
 because the marathon what has one thing 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.480
 is that it puts you in your place we go a 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.720
 kilometer before one kilometer after 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:28.660
 because it puts you in your place does not end the 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.330
 career that could be better posed to 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.920
 we would be that it was a career a 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.890
 rhythm 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.260
 intermediate for them to go now 3 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.489
 now 4 and then there would be someone who 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.250
 was far superior to the rest of that 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:44.309
 the burst you have to go out and make a mark 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.309
 personal 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.530
 you have to perform a little 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.370
 and from now on we began to 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:02.930
 train a lot less and two weeks 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.930
 of more than 200 km 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.240
 where does it start? 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.430
 but when but when below the 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.550
 Habits of the room look like a 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.510
 grandfather 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:17.400
 then as you see they are also more 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:20.690
 rejuvenated half that low and start 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.690
 training is an ordeal 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.200
 but it seems you do not have 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:35.480
 every day without fail cooking 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.320
 I come here this is a stretcher and 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.320
 someone else 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.720
 to suffer that 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.180
 look 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.620
 this milk
