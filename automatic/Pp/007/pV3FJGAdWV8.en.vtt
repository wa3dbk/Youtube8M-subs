00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
if you go to panda express you can get

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.229 
if you go to panda express you can get
like<00:02:16.680> one<00:02:16.950> entree<00:02:17.340> or<00:02:17.459> two<00:02:17.640> entrees<00:02:18.060> and

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
like one entree or two entrees and

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.430 
like one entree or two entrees and
entree<00:02:19.140> is<00:02:19.349> a<00:02:19.409> serving<00:02:19.980> so<00:02:20.450> I<00:02:21.450> think<00:02:22.230> it's

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
entree is a serving so I think it's

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.839 
entree is a serving so I think it's
shocking<00:02:22.890> that<00:02:22.920> it's<00:02:23.129> that<00:02:23.280> low<00:02:23.459> but<00:02:23.670> I<00:02:23.700> think

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
shocking that it's that low but I think

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.490 
shocking that it's that low but I think
it's<00:02:23.970> because<00:02:24.030> they<00:02:24.269> pack<00:02:24.629> it<00:02:24.659> in<00:02:24.930> with<00:02:25.080> a<00:02:25.110> ton

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
it's because they pack it in with a ton

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.199 
it's because they pack it in with a ton
of<00:02:25.530> broccoli<00:02:26.040> yeah<00:02:26.250> one<00:02:26.700> fast<00:02:27.000> food
