00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
talk about so much that I didn't want to

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.330

and there are 72 slots here which is
divided<00:00:56.489> across<00:00:56.760> two<00:00:57.030> different<00:00:57.300> pages<00:00:57.480> if

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
divided across two different pages if

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.990 
divided across two different pages if
you<00:00:58.530> then<00:00:58.680> swaps<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.039> AMA<00:00:59.219> page<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.730> again

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
you then swaps the AMA page you again

have another 72 slots which is actually
more<00:01:02.609> than<00:01:02.670> double<00:01:03.030> given<00:01:03.390> that<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.539> weapon

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
more than double given that the weapon

more than double given that the weapon
column<00:01:04.019> right<00:01:04.110> now<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.530> little<00:01:04.619> bit<00:01:04.860> bigger

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
column right now is a little bit bigger

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.649 
column right now is a little bit bigger
than<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.220> armor<00:01:05.460> one<00:01:05.640> so<00:01:06.270> we're<00:01:06.390> offers<00:01:06.600> you

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
getting a lot more space for armor as

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.950 
getting a lot more space for armor as
well<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.610> if<00:01:08.700> we<00:01:08.790> then<00:01:08.939> move<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.479> items

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
well and if we then move to the items

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.149 
well and if we then move to the items
page<00:01:10.080> or<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.260> general<00:01:10.439> page<00:01:10.770> you'll<00:01:11.070> see

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
page or the general page you'll see

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.710 
page or the general page you'll see
there<00:01:11.700> aren't<00:01:11.820> quite<00:01:12.060> as<00:01:12.090> many<00:01:12.270> slots<00:01:12.479> here

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
there aren't quite as many slots here

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.630 
there aren't quite as many slots here
there's<00:01:12.900> only<00:01:12.990> 36<00:01:13.530> but<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.890> reason<00:01:14.040> for<00:01:14.549> this

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
there's only 36 but the reason for this

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.429 
there's only 36 but the reason for this
is<00:01:14.850> because<00:01:14.909> all<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.049> things<00:01:16.229> that<00:01:16.290> would

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
is because all the things that would

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.660 
is because all the things that would
normally<00:01:16.470> take<00:01:16.799> up<00:01:16.950> your<00:01:17.009> space<00:01:17.220> here<00:01:17.460> like

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
normally take up your space here like

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.330 
normally take up your space here like
shaders<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.150> emblems<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.200> ships<00:01:19.409> they<00:01:20.070> are

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
shaders and emblems and ships they are

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.590 
shaders and emblems and ships they are
all<00:01:20.520> going<00:01:20.759> into<00:01:21.090> what<00:01:21.240> is<00:01:21.360> known<00:01:21.540> as

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
all going into what is known as

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.270 
all going into what is known as
collections<00:01:22.350> now<00:01:22.530> actually<00:01:22.799> have<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:22.920> separate

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
collections now actually have a separate

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.920 
collections now actually have a separate
video<00:01:23.369> on<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.729> little<00:01:23.970> bit<00:01:24.090> later<00:01:24.330> but

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
video on that a little bit later but

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.510 
video on that a little bit later but
basically<00:01:24.990> collections<00:01:25.950> are<00:01:26.130> these<00:01:26.310> sort<00:01:26.490> of

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
basically collections are these sort of

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.130 
basically collections are these sort of
screens<00:01:26.850> which<00:01:27.060> you'll<00:01:27.270> find<00:01:27.479> over<00:01:27.689> near<00:01:27.900> evil

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
screens which you'll find over near evil

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.020 
screens which you'll find over near evil
avanti<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.100> basically<00:01:29.250> go<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.579> those<00:01:29.790> and

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
avanti and you basically go to those and

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.460 
avanti and you basically go to those and
once<00:01:30.150> you<00:01:30.240> interact<00:01:30.570> with<00:01:30.630> them<00:01:30.869> they<00:01:31.350> will

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
once you interact with them they will

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.109 
once you interact with them they will
allow<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.829> take<00:01:32.009> out<00:01:32.159> any<00:01:32.460> of<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.610> emblems

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
allow you to take out any of the emblems

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.149 
allow you to take out any of the emblems
ships<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:33.930> shaders<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:34.590> have<00:01:34.710> currently<00:01:35.040> a

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
ships and shaders you have currently a

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.770 
ships and shaders you have currently a
quiet<00:01:35.430> which<00:01:35.670> means<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:36.000> no<00:01:36.150> longer<00:01:36.180> need<00:01:36.600> to

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
quiet which means you no longer need to

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.789 
quiet which means you no longer need to
store<00:01:36.990> them<00:01:37.110> in<00:01:37.140> your<00:01:37.290> vault<00:01:37.470> you<00:01:37.650> can

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
store them in your vault you can

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.289 
store them in your vault you can
dismantle<00:01:38.100> all<00:01:38.340> these<00:01:38.610> ones<00:01:38.820> because<00:01:39.119> once

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
dismantle all these ones because once

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.999 
dismantle all these ones because once
you've<00:01:39.450> unlocked<00:01:39.659> one<00:01:39.960> is<00:01:40.140> unlocked<00:01:40.799> in<00:01:40.890> your

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
you've unlocked one is unlocked in your

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.859 
you've unlocked one is unlocked in your
collection<00:01:41.130> which<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:42.030> can<00:01:42.180> then<00:01:42.210> get<00:01:42.570> later

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
collection which you can then get later

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.780 
collection which you can then get later
so<00:01:43.439> basically<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:44.130> only<00:01:44.280> thing<00:01:44.610> you'll<00:01:44.729> be

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.609 
so basically the only thing you'll be
keeping<00:01:44.939> in<00:01:45.210> your<00:01:45.329> materials<00:01:45.750> thing<00:01:45.930> I<00:01:46.079> like
