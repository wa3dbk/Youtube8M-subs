spelled with the K obviously was short
for<00:00:47.400> something<00:00:47.580> but<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:47.910> kind<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.239> forget<00:00:48.480> when

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
for something but I kind of forget when

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.470 
for something but I kind of forget when
he<00:00:49.080> told<00:00:49.290> me<00:00:49.500> but<00:00:49.800> anyway<00:00:50.580> he<00:00:50.879> built<00:00:51.120> this<00:00:51.239> base

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
he told me but anyway he built this base

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.180 
he told me but anyway he built this base
at<00:00:51.720> the<00:00:51.870> airfield<00:00:52.350> which<00:00:52.470> is<00:00:52.590> kind<00:00:52.890> of<00:00:52.980> similar

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
at the airfield which is kind of similar

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.090 
at the airfield which is kind of similar
to<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.550> last<00:00:53.660> video<00:00:54.660> but<00:00:55.050> very<00:00:55.620> different<00:00:55.920> in

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
to the last video but very different in

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.890 
to the last video but very different in
its<00:00:56.250> own<00:00:56.400> way<00:00:56.610> it<00:00:57.059> has<00:00:57.210> five<00:00:57.600> million

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:57.900 
its own way it has five million

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.780 
its own way it has five million
components<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:58.440> have<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:59.129> tower<00:00:59.460> which

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
components you have the tower which

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.729 
components you have the tower which
serves<00:01:00.059> as<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.270> great<00:01:00.570> vantage<00:01:00.840> point<00:01:01.320> the

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
serves as a great vantage point the

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.350 
serves as a great vantage point the
first<00:01:01.980> complex<00:01:02.580> is<00:01:02.699> just<00:01:02.730> kind<00:01:03.060> of<00:01:03.120> just<00:01:03.180> like

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:03.360 
first complex is just kind of just like

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.359 
first complex is just kind of just like
storage<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.259> that<00:01:04.680> kind<00:01:04.890> of<00:01:04.949> stuff

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
storage and that kind of stuff

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.010 
storage and that kind of stuff
the<00:01:05.610> second<00:01:05.970> complex<00:01:06.450> which<00:01:06.600> is<00:01:06.690> more<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:06.930> like

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
the second complex which is more of like

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.740 
the second complex which is more of like
a<00:01:07.280> back<00:01:08.280> porch<00:01:08.550> a<00:01:08.729> deck<00:01:08.970> stuff<00:01:09.210> like<00:01:09.390> that<00:01:09.540> and

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
a back porch a deck stuff like that and

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.200 
a back porch a deck stuff like that and
then<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.899> third<00:01:10.140> complex<00:01:10.860> which<00:01:11.220> is<00:01:11.399> on<00:01:11.850> top<00:01:12.090> of

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
then a third complex which is on top of

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.420 
then a third complex which is on top of
the<00:01:12.270> hangars<00:01:12.660> actually<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.350> all<00:01:13.920> this<00:01:14.220> is

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
the hangars actually and all this is

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.400 
the hangars actually and all this is
connected<00:01:14.940> by<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.420> bridge<00:01:15.930> that<00:01:16.080> looks

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:16.410 
connected by a bridge that looks

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.650 
connected by a bridge that looks
fantastic<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:17.310> even<00:01:17.820> have<00:01:17.940> a<00:01:17.970> greenhouse<00:01:18.390> in

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:18.660 
fantastic and even have a greenhouse in

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.060 
fantastic and even have a greenhouse in
the<00:01:18.750> back<00:01:18.960> but<00:01:19.170> I'll<00:01:19.259> get<00:01:19.410> to<00:01:19.440> that<00:01:19.530> later

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
the back but I'll get to that later

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.800 
the back but I'll get to that later
so<00:01:20.310> let's<00:01:21.030> get<00:01:21.180> right<00:01:21.300> into<00:01:21.509> it<00:01:21.600> you<00:01:21.780> have

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
so let's get right into it you have

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.930 
so let's get right into it you have
electric<00:01:22.440> fences<00:01:22.830> around<00:01:23.100> this<00:01:23.220> entire<00:01:23.640> base

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
electric fences around this entire base

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.700 
electric fences around this entire base
including<00:01:24.810> even<00:01:24.930> in<00:01:25.080> front<00:01:25.229> of<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.350> hangars

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
including even in front of the hangars

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.800 
including even in front of the hangars
because<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.460> zombies<00:01:26.670> actually<00:01:27.300> spawn<00:01:27.630> in

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
because the zombies actually spawn in

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.630 
because the zombies actually spawn in
there<00:01:27.990> so<00:01:28.229> it's<00:01:28.410> very<00:01:28.619> helpful<00:01:29.100> so<00:01:29.340> they<00:01:29.490> don't

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
there so it's very helpful so they don't

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.889 
there so it's very helpful so they don't
come<00:01:29.759> in<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:29.940> main<00:01:30.119> area<00:01:30.330> they'll<00:01:30.540> just<00:01:30.690> kill

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:30.899 
come in the main area they'll just kill

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:32.660 
come in the main area they'll just kill
themselves<00:01:31.290> automatically<00:01:31.800> by<00:01:32.280> running<00:01:32.460> into

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
themselves automatically by running into

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.160 
themselves automatically by running into
an<00:01:32.759> electric<00:01:33.030> fence<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.450> not<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:33.840> bright

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
an electric fence and not that bright

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.550 
an electric fence and not that bright
and<00:01:35.660> go<00:01:36.660> through<00:01:36.869> that<00:01:36.990> so<00:01:37.080> we're<00:01:37.200> gonna<00:01:37.289> start

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
and go through that so we're gonna start

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.320 
and go through that so we're gonna start
with<00:01:37.709> the<00:01:37.860> first<00:01:38.100> complex<00:01:38.759> it's<00:01:38.940> kind<00:01:39.149> of<00:01:39.179> like

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
with the first complex it's kind of like

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:40.730 
with the first complex it's kind of like
your<00:01:39.450> average<00:01:39.630> would<00:01:40.140> at<00:01:40.259> home<00:01:40.289> you<00:01:40.709> have

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
your average would at home you have

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.070 
your average would at home you have
storage<00:01:41.250> chests<00:01:41.759> at<00:01:42.149> the<00:01:42.360> end<00:01:42.539> there's

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
storage chests at the end there's

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.469 
storage chests at the end there's
multiple<00:01:43.500> rooms<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:44.220> pretty<00:01:44.729> much<00:01:44.910> go<00:01:45.179> all

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
multiple rooms that pretty much go all

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.540 
multiple rooms that pretty much go all
about<00:01:45.840> there's<00:01:46.470> windows<00:01:46.860> that<00:01:47.009> can<00:01:47.130> be<00:01:47.250> open

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
about there's windows that can be open

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.639 
about there's windows that can be open
and<00:01:47.670> closed<00:01:47.970> depending<00:01:48.539> on<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:48.959> situation

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
and closed depending on the situation

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.290 
and closed depending on the situation
and<00:01:49.830> this<00:01:50.220> whole<00:01:50.399> entire<00:01:50.670> base<00:01:50.940> is<00:01:51.149> pretty

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
and this whole entire base is pretty

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.990 
and this whole entire base is pretty
much<00:01:51.509> lit<00:01:51.720> up<00:01:51.840> by<00:01:51.990> both<00:01:52.229> torches<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.130> also

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
much lit up by both torches and also

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.940 
much lit up by both torches and also
lights<00:01:54.360> that<00:01:54.630> work<00:01:54.810> off<00:01:54.990> of<00:01:55.170> generators<00:01:55.740> and

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
lights that work off of generators and

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.529 
lights that work off of generators and
there's<00:01:56.610> also<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.819> second<00:01:57.119> entrance<00:01:57.300> to<00:01:57.450> the

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:57.539 
there's also a second entrance to the

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:59.059 
there's also a second entrance to the
house<00:01:57.690> that's<00:01:57.899> right<00:01:58.140> under<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.470> bridge<00:01:58.740> and

once<00:03:00.470> you<00:03:00.530> turn<00:03:00.680> around<00:03:00.799> and<00:03:00.980> go<00:03:01.040> out<00:03:01.220> and<00:03:01.400> this

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
once you turn around and go out and this

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.229 
once you turn around and go out and this
bridge<00:03:02.810> can<00:03:03.069> access<00:03:04.069> all<00:03:04.370> the<00:03:04.670> complexes

bridge can access all the complexes
we're<00:03:05.450> gonna<00:03:05.599> go<00:03:05.690> to<00:03:05.780> the<00:03:05.900> second<00:03:06.590> complex<00:03:06.890> but

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:07.099 
we're gonna go to the second complex but

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:08.289 
we're gonna go to the second complex but
we're<00:03:07.190> gonna<00:03:07.310> start<00:03:07.489> from<00:03:07.579> the<00:03:07.640> bottom<00:03:07.849> to<00:03:08.209> get

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
we're gonna start from the bottom to get

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:10.360 
we're gonna start from the bottom to get
to<00:03:08.420> this<00:03:08.540> one<00:03:08.780> it's<00:03:09.709> fairly<00:03:09.920> simple<00:03:10.310> the

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
to this one it's fairly simple the

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:11.890 
to this one it's fairly simple the
bottom<00:03:10.700> level<00:03:10.849> basically<00:03:11.329> serves<00:03:11.629> as<00:03:11.870> a

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
bottom level basically serves as a

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.839 
bottom level basically serves as a
garage<00:03:12.290> and<00:03:12.650> a<00:03:12.739> fueling<00:03:13.159> station<00:03:13.519> so<00:03:13.670> if<00:03:13.730> you

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:13.849 
garage and a fueling station so if you

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:15.520 
garage and a fueling station so if you
have<00:03:13.970> cars<00:03:14.269> they're<00:03:14.840> pretty<00:03:15.049> much<00:03:15.200> ready<00:03:15.260> to

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
have cars they're pretty much ready to

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.069 
have cars they're pretty much ready to
go<00:03:15.650> at<00:03:15.950> any<00:03:16.010> point<00:03:16.430> in<00:03:16.549> time<00:03:16.579> the<00:03:17.510> second<00:03:17.870> floor

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079

guests too close to you the top serves
this<00:03:24.980> more<00:03:25.159> of<00:03:25.190> like<00:03:25.280> a<00:03:25.400> back<00:03:25.609> porch<00:03:26.000> and<00:03:26.180> you

this more of like a back porch and you

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:27.940 
this more of like a back porch and you
can<00:03:26.420> actually<00:03:26.540> see<00:03:26.840> a<00:03:26.870> dock<00:03:27.230> in<00:03:27.260> the<00:03:27.500> distance

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950

can actually see a dock in the distance
and<00:03:28.069> this<00:03:28.220> was<00:03:28.400> built<00:03:28.700> just<00:03:28.909> in<00:03:29.329> case<00:03:29.569> Nelson

way and then we'll head over to the

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:54.280 
way and then we'll head over to the
third<00:03:52.699> complex<00:03:53.299> which<00:03:53.419> is<00:03:53.510> actually<00:03:53.930> on<00:03:54.079> top

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
third complex which is actually on top

third complex which is actually on top
of<00:03:54.500> a<00:03:54.590> hangar<00:03:55.010> there's<00:03:55.400> three<00:03:55.730> floors<00:03:55.910> with

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
this one all of them are pretty much

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.729 
this one all of them are pretty much
each<00:03:58.489> like<00:03:58.639> a<00:03:58.730> giant<00:03:59.150> room<00:03:59.480> and<00:03:59.750> there's<00:04:00.290> ramps

each like a giant room and there's ramps
that<00:04:00.769> serve<00:04:01.190> as<00:04:01.370> stairwells<00:04:01.910> and<00:04:02.180> when<00:04:02.750> you're

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
that serve as stairwells and when you're

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.599 
that serve as stairwells and when you're
at<00:04:02.959> the<00:04:03.109> top<00:04:03.410> you<00:04:03.560> have<00:04:03.590> a<00:04:03.709> deck<00:04:04.099> which<00:04:04.280> looks

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:04.609 
at the top you have a deck which looks

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:07.150 
at the top you have a deck which looks
over<00:04:04.940> the<00:04:05.090> main<00:04:05.569> deck<00:04:05.870> and<00:04:06.079> also<00:04:06.290> the<00:04:06.859> rest<00:04:07.040> of

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
over the main deck and also the rest of

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.979 
over the main deck and also the rest of
the<00:04:07.250> airfield<00:04:07.639> and<00:04:07.970> when<00:04:08.569> you<00:04:08.660> go<00:04:08.780> back<00:04:08.959> down

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
the airfield and when you go back down

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:11.199 
the airfield and when you go back down
you'll<00:04:09.500> see<00:04:09.769> another<00:04:10.280> bridge<00:04:10.730> and<00:04:11.000> that

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
you'll see another bridge and that

brings you to the other hangar this

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:14.920 
brings you to the other hangar this

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
could be kind of like a last resort if

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.839 
could be kind of like a last resort if
anything<00:04:15.349> goes<00:04:15.500> wrong<00:04:15.620> then<00:04:16.459> it<00:04:16.579> gives<00:04:16.699> you<00:04:16.820> a

question<00:05:29.450> for<00:05:29.900> you<00:05:29.960> is<00:05:30.080> why<00:05:30.740> did<00:05:30.980> you<00:05:31.100> build

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 
question for you is why did you build

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.870 
question for you is why did you build
the<00:05:31.460> base<00:05:31.639> at<00:05:31.910> the<00:05:31.940> airfield<00:05:32.480> I<00:05:33.730> think<00:05:34.730> it's

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 
the base at the airfield I think it's

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.350 
the base at the airfield I think it's
like<00:05:35.360> the<00:05:35.570> easiest<00:05:35.720> place<00:05:36.200> to<00:05:36.530> get<00:05:37.400> lots<00:05:38.090> of

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
like the easiest place to get lots of

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.700 
like the easiest place to get lots of
medical<00:05:39.260> stuff<00:05:39.560> and<00:05:39.800> also<00:05:40.720> guns<00:05:41.720> and<00:05:42.320> also<00:05:42.620> you
