mushi are not currently in China right

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.660 
mushi are not currently in China right
now<00:01:01.379> so<00:01:01.980> that<00:01:02.160> means<00:01:02.340> they're<00:01:02.460> usually

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
now so that means they're usually

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.329 
now so that means they're usually
playing<00:01:03.030> with<00:01:03.180> around<00:01:03.539> maybe<00:01:04.320> like<00:01:04.530> 120<00:01:05.189> to

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
playing with around maybe like 120 to

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.700 
playing with around maybe like 120 to
150<00:01:05.909> ping<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.330> there's<00:01:06.900> actually<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.290> lot<00:01:07.409> of

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
150 ping and there's actually a lot of

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.149 
150 ping and there's actually a lot of
difference<00:01:08.010> if<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.310> watched<00:01:09.950> mushi<00:01:10.950> play

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
difference if you watched mushi play

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.750 
difference if you watched mushi play
yesterday<00:01:11.850> so<00:01:11.909> I<00:01:12.450> think<00:01:12.869> that<00:01:13.409> with<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.369> lag

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
yesterday so I think that with the lag

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.570 
yesterday so I think that with the lag
factored<00:01:15.420> in<00:01:15.630> I'll<00:01:15.900> probably<00:01:16.170> say<00:01:16.710> it's<00:01:16.890> 60<00:01:17.310> 40

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
factored in I'll probably say it's 60 40

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.350 
factored in I'll probably say it's 60 40

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.840 
kind of unsure about this matchup I can
easily<00:01:45.630> see<00:01:45.990> DK<00:01:46.380> taking<00:01:46.740> this<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:47.100> zero<00:01:47.399> but<00:01:47.640> at

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
easily see DK taking this to zero but at

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.260 
easily see DK taking this to zero but at
122<00:01:48.750> odds<00:01:49.170> I'll<00:01:49.439> be<00:01:49.590> betting<00:01:49.950> on<00:01:50.100> vici<00:01:50.759> because

122 odds I'll be betting on vici because
I<00:01:51.329> think<00:01:51.540> it<00:01:51.630> should<00:01:51.750> be<00:01:51.810> like<00:01:51.990> 6040<00:01:52.590> with<00:01:52.829> the

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
I think it should be like 6040 with the

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.240 
I think it should be like 6040 with the
lag<00:01:53.670> factor<00:01:54.149> next<00:01:55.049> one<00:01:55.140> that<00:01:55.229> we<00:01:55.350> have<00:01:55.470> is<00:01:55.680> mi

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
verses for love and I think that these
