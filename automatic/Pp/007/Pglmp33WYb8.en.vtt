we looked at is how high school students

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:29.460 
we looked at is how high school students

and<00:00:29.740> we<00:00:29.890> specifically<00:00:30.460> looked<00:00:30.640> at<00:00:31.150> biology

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:31.600 
and we specifically looked at biology

and we specifically looked at biology

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.219 
different separately and what we found
was<00:00:38.170> is<00:00:38.739> that<00:00:39.190> the<00:00:39.909> student<00:00:40.269> evaluation<00:00:41.050> is

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:41.229 
was is that the student evaluation is

was is that the student evaluation is

and<00:00:44.199> all<00:00:44.500> of<00:00:44.680> the<00:00:44.830> sciences<00:00:45.430> were<00:00:45.760> under<00:00:46.210> rated

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
and all of the sciences were under rated

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.060 
and all of the sciences were under rated
by<00:00:47.019> their<00:00:47.589> male<00:00:48.339> students<00:00:49.320> whereas<00:00:50.320> the

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
by their male students whereas the

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.430 
by their male students whereas the
female<00:00:51.519> students<00:00:52.059> only<00:00:52.299> underrated<00:00:53.260> their

female students only underrated their

female students only underrated their
female<00:00:53.860> teachers<00:00:54.309> and<00:00:54.640> physics<00:00:55.119> so<00:00:56.080> we<00:00:56.500> were

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:56.650 
female teachers and physics so we were

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.180 
female teachers and physics so we were
finding<00:00:57.010> a<00:00:57.400> field<00:00:58.299> specific<00:00:58.989> disparity<00:00:59.830> for

females and across all of the sciences

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:06.120 
females and across all of the sciences
there<00:01:03.610> was<00:01:03.729> a<00:01:03.760> disparity<00:01:04.420> for<00:01:05.140> the<00:01:05.650> way<00:01:05.770> the

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
there was a disparity for the way the

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.709 
there was a disparity for the way the
male<00:01:06.340> students<00:01:06.880> were<00:01:07.030> raiding<00:01:07.420> their

male students were raiding their
teachers<00:01:09.329> they<00:01:10.329> used<00:01:10.479> to<00:01:10.570> think<00:01:10.810> that<00:01:10.869> it's

00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:11.079 
teachers they used to think that it's

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:13.020 
teachers they used to think that it's
because<00:01:11.380> girls<00:01:11.920> didn't<00:01:12.159> do<00:01:12.340> as<00:01:12.490> well<00:01:12.520> as<00:01:12.700> boys

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:16.789 
on tests that's just not true anymore
boys<00:01:15.789> and<00:01:15.939> girls<00:01:15.969> do<00:01:16.210> pretty<00:01:16.359> much

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
boys and girls do pretty much

studying physics as opposed to as

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.899 
studying physics as opposed to as
opposed<00:01:29.590> to<00:01:29.679> females<00:01:29.950> so<00:01:30.460> the<00:01:30.579> question

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
opposed to females so the question

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:33.330 
opposed to females so the question
remains<00:01:31.179> why<00:01:31.899> are<00:01:32.229> so<00:01:32.499> few<00:01:32.530> females<00:01:33.100> going

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
remains why are so few females going

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:34.919 
remains why are so few females going
into<00:01:33.490> physics<00:01:33.820> so<00:01:34.299> the<00:01:34.390> important<00:01:34.749> thing<00:01:34.899> for

00:01:34.919 --> 00:01:34.929 
into physics so the important thing for

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:37.410 
into physics so the important thing for
us<00:01:35.109> is<00:01:35.229> to<00:01:35.469> understand<00:01:35.979> that<00:01:36.700> this<00:01:36.969> bias<00:01:37.240> that

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
us is to understand that this bias that

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.120 
us is to understand that this bias that
we're<00:01:37.929> seeing<00:01:38.170> which<00:01:38.439> is<00:01:38.590> especially

we're seeing which is especially

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.779 
we're seeing which is especially

00:01:44.849 --> 00:01:44.859 
it at the high school level because we

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:46.800 
it at the high school level because we
