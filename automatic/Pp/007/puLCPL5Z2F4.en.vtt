ferrule is aluminum world's Mike right
now<00:00:49.910> is<00:00:50.239> working<00:00:50.449> on<00:00:50.690> Bush<00:00:50.960> number<00:00:51.170> four<00:00:51.589> back

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.619 
now is working on Bush number four back
there<00:00:52.129> but<00:00:52.790> we're<00:00:52.940> going<00:00:53.030> to<00:00:53.089> show<00:00:53.300> you<00:00:53.330> what

there but we're going to show you what
kind<00:00:53.809> of<00:00:53.989> corrosion<00:00:54.470> we<00:00:54.830> actually<00:00:55.250> find<00:00:55.580> in

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
kind of corrosion we actually find in

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.719 
kind of corrosion we actually find in
there<00:00:56.080> you<00:00:57.080> can<00:00:57.260> see<00:00:57.500> that<00:00:58.040> it<00:00:58.159> pulls<00:00:58.400> back<00:00:58.549> a

00:00:58.719 --> 00:00:58.729 
there you can see that it pulls back a

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:02.380 
there you can see that it pulls back a
little<00:00:59.059> bit<00:00:59.269> on<00:01:00.430> both<00:01:01.430> sides<00:01:01.790> but<00:01:02.030> that<00:01:02.180> goes

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
little bit on both sides but that goes

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.439 
little bit on both sides but that goes
all<00:01:03.080> the<00:01:03.140> way<00:01:03.320> to<00:01:03.379> about<00:01:03.799> here<00:01:04.190> I'm<00:01:05.000> gonna<00:01:05.180> come

all the way to about here I'm gonna come

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.230 
all the way to about here I'm gonna come
a<00:01:05.479> little<00:01:05.750> bit<00:01:06.049> closer<00:01:06.409> and<00:01:06.830> show<00:01:07.729> you<00:01:07.790> the<00:01:08.030> bad

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
a little bit closer and show you the bad

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.469 
a little bit closer and show you the bad
one<00:01:08.979> this<00:01:09.979> is<00:01:10.220> what<00:01:10.430> made<00:01:10.640> us<00:01:10.670> go<00:01:11.060> in<00:01:11.210> there<00:01:11.360> in

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
one this is what made us go in there in

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:14.020 
one this is what made us go in there in
the<00:01:11.570> first<00:01:11.600> place<00:01:12.190> it<00:01:13.190> looks<00:01:13.490> like<00:01:13.760> this<00:01:13.970> on

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
the first place it looks like this on

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.990 
the first place it looks like this on
the<00:01:14.360> car<00:01:14.600> which<00:01:14.869> doesn't<00:01:15.320> look<00:01:15.440> too<00:01:15.650> bad

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
the car which doesn't look too bad

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.890 
the car which doesn't look too bad
except<00:01:17.000> we've<00:01:17.150> got<00:01:17.270> a<00:01:17.299> good<00:01:17.570> amount<00:01:17.750> of

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
except we've got a good amount of

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.859 
except we've got a good amount of
corrosion<00:01:18.140> in<00:01:18.560> there<00:01:19.060> alright<00:01:20.060> if<00:01:20.450> you<00:01:20.600> own<00:01:20.690> an

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
corrosion in there alright if you own an

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:21.310 
corrosion in there alright if you own an
ELYX

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
ELYX

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.800 
ELYX
and<00:01:21.500> you<00:01:21.950> drive<00:01:22.219> anywhere<00:01:22.820> near<00:01:23.119> salt<00:01:23.539> water

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
and you drive anywhere near salt water

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.709 
and you drive anywhere near salt water
or<00:01:24.649> where<00:01:24.829> they<00:01:24.950> use<00:01:25.130> salt<00:01:25.460> on<00:01:25.670> the<00:01:25.789> roads<00:01:26.030> this

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:26.719 
or where they use salt on the roads this

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:32.529 
or where they use salt on the roads this
is<00:01:26.930> like<00:01:27.079> a<00:01:27.109> horror<00:01:27.530> story<00:01:29.799> it's<00:01:30.799> gone<00:01:31.539> it's

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:32.539 
is like a horror story it's gone it's

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:35.910 
is like a horror story it's gone it's
completely<00:01:33.409> gone<00:01:33.759> look<00:01:34.759> at<00:01:34.939> this

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
completely gone look at this

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.390 
completely gone look at this
and<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:37.420> corrosion<00:01:38.020> has<00:01:38.290> eroded<00:01:38.710> the<00:01:38.980> bond<00:01:39.190> of

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
and the corrosion has eroded the bond of

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.880 
and the corrosion has eroded the bond of
the<00:01:39.430> rubber<00:01:39.670> this<00:01:40.360> rubber<00:01:40.840> is<00:01:40.960> supposed<00:01:41.560> to<00:01:41.680> be

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
the rubber this rubber is supposed to be

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.000 
the rubber this rubber is supposed to be
100%<00:01:42.610> bonded<00:01:43.480> to<00:01:43.630> this<00:01:43.750> ferrule<00:01:44.140> and<00:01:44.260> it's

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 
100% bonded to this ferrule and it's

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.820 
100% bonded to this ferrule and it's
gone<00:01:45.520> so<00:01:46.420> aside<00:01:46.810> from<00:01:46.870> the<00:01:47.140> small<00:01:47.500> visible

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
gone so aside from the small visible

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.430 
gone so aside from the small visible
tears<00:01:48.340> we<00:01:48.550> could<00:01:48.730> see<00:01:48.940> the<00:01:49.720> corrosion<00:01:50.350> has

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
tears we could see the corrosion has

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.180 
tears we could see the corrosion has
caused<00:01:50.740> this<00:01:50.980> bush<00:01:51.280> to<00:01:51.880> essentially<00:01:52.510> fail

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
caused this bush to essentially fail

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.070 
caused this bush to essentially fail
let's<00:01:54.190> get<00:01:54.400> into<00:01:54.640> this<00:01:54.810> subframe<00:01:55.810> pushed

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
let's get into this subframe pushed

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.980 
let's get into this subframe pushed
together<00:01:56.290> and<00:01:56.860> see<00:01:57.040> exactly<00:01:57.370> what<00:01:57.580> we<00:01:57.850> find<00:01:58.150> up

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
together and see exactly what we find up

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.730 
together and see exactly what we find up
on<00:01:59.200> the<00:01:59.320> car<00:02:00.930> I'm<00:02:01.930> able<00:02:02.260> to<00:02:02.290> take<00:02:02.560> the

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
on the car I'm able to take the

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.860 
on the car I'm able to take the
screwdriver<00:02:03.040> where<00:02:03.550> it's<00:02:03.700> corroded<00:02:04.270> and

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.870 
screwdriver where it's corroded and

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.160 
screwdriver where it's corroded and
without<00:02:05.860> much<00:02:06.040> effort<00:02:06.630> we're<00:02:07.630> putting<00:02:07.930> it<00:02:08.020> in

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
without much effort we're putting it in

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.190 
without much effort we're putting it in
this<00:02:08.380> deep<00:02:09.060> let's<00:02:10.060> do<00:02:10.209> the<00:02:10.360> other<00:02:10.479> side<00:02:10.840> we'll

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
this deep let's do the other side we'll

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.540 
this deep let's do the other side we'll
do<00:02:11.350> the<00:02:11.470> same<00:02:11.709> thing<00:02:12.420> or<00:02:13.420> going<00:02:13.780> in<00:02:13.930> this<00:02:14.110> deep

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.330 

stick<00:02:17.270> a<00:02:17.300> knife<00:02:17.540> open<00:02:18.290> it<00:02:18.380> up<00:02:18.500> and<00:02:18.770> see<00:02:19.070> what<00:02:19.220> we

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
stick a knife open it up and see what we

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:29.890 
stick a knife open it up and see what we
really<00:02:19.370> have

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.259 

Wow<00:02:30.709> we're<00:02:31.040> floated<00:02:31.610> deeper<00:02:31.970> than<00:02:32.120> the

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
Wow we're floated deeper than the

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:35.710 
Wow we're floated deeper than the
screwdriver<00:02:32.810> went<00:02:33.110> in<00:02:34.330> let's<00:02:35.330> check<00:02:35.569> the

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
screwdriver went in let's check the

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:45.090 
screwdriver went in let's check the
other<00:02:35.750> side

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.060 

live<00:02:45.490> real<00:02:46.300> time<00:02:46.330> you're<00:02:47.170> seeing<00:02:47.500> it<00:02:47.710> when<00:02:47.860> we

live real time you're seeing it when we

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:53.220 
live real time you're seeing it when we
see<00:02:48.370> it<00:02:49.080> top<00:02:50.080> to<00:02:50.110> bottom<00:02:50.520> the<00:02:51.520> corrosion<00:02:52.230> has

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
see it top to bottom the corrosion has

00:02:53.230 --> 00:03:03.190 
see it top to bottom the corrosion has
taken<00:02:53.770> its<00:02:53.920> toll<00:02:54.010> on<00:02:54.570> this<00:02:55.570> subframe<00:02:56.350> push

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.990 

got<00:03:03.770> a<00:03:03.800> little<00:03:04.040> deeper<00:03:04.430> here<00:03:04.610> on<00:03:04.760> the<00:03:04.849> other
