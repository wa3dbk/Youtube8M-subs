00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:06.860
 Euro today I want to hear HK Christkind introduce 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.600
 a tripod head in 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.379
 Throws off the wheel 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:13.709
 it is a driven years 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:15.509
 this one has for 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.980
 in horizontal examine with vertical gift 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.400
 one each 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.680
 Gear function that means you turn this button here 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.710
 and then you can 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.529
 the axis 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.529
 Plus minus set 30 degrees 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.680
 conversely for the other side there is a bone here and then you can do that 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:36.850
 other side 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.480
 Federal Council sworn 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.960
 there is one for each of the two axes 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.360
 the balls 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.000
 and then precisely 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.380
 he can do something 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.400
 on the Libra legal status for example 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.420
 to the 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.990
 30 degrees swivel 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:00.270
 in addition to general yes but even if you need more offers this head 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.030
 fell 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.500
 the possibility 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.380
 open this button 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.380
 here again up to 60 degrees 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.000
 you can absolutely suffer here in Bern their position 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.220
 hold yours 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.290
 and if you have it from Unrecht state from gift you can through the 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.670
 additional 30 degrees here 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.770
 go up to the vertical 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.940
 Thus, even if one is no lesser than 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.940
 what to recommend is of course 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.600
 go up to portrait with their heads 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.940
 You can also do it here in Hamm 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.500
 the gearbox was for the own axis 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.930
 Here is the small gear which is driven by the button 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.590
 and then here 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.760
 over the rack 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:47.570
 this 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.340
 Schwenke performs 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.940
 the head 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.950
 unlike, for example, the shoots of Manfrotto 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.280
 the visitors drive a gear racks 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.340
 and no game operation 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.410
 that means it is theoretically possible 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.570
 and also in every position by hand 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.400
 to move again because I will return to this 

00:02:12.149 --> 00:02:15.149
 you can with great power 

00:02:15.149 --> 00:02:16.539
 here also 

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:18.689
 to move in that way 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:20.800
 by Rolf Breuer must be strength 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.379
 the along 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.869
 the turning ax tracks 

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:28.049
 normal forces then yes, for example, percent 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.169
 transversal or departure 

00:02:31.169 --> 00:02:34.299
 it's almost impossible to move him anyway 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:38.119
 Here for both axes in each case a kind of friction 

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:40.119
 which one can put a firm 

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:43.179
 and then the shoots get heavier 

00:02:43.179 --> 00:02:46.259
 You should have to hang in quite heavy equipment 

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:50.939
 For me and my camera equipment, the really open position 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:55.059
 completely sufficient I can not imagine how Cavalli shoots 

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:56.729
 should move 

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:58.860
 but the head is from Arcor 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.230
 a manufacturer in large format camera as well as on Christmas at ten 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.179
 intended 

00:03:03.179 --> 00:03:07.219
 and because it can build up a long bang ground of course that humor too 

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:08.919
 come to greater forces 

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:12.019
 for this has been 4 and adds her for each axis 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:14.209
 one 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.289
 Fiction ZDFneo 

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:19.280
 which has the head and added hard heads 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.989
 both below 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.389
 as well as above my swivel can 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:26.879
 So you can set the head so the amount would like to have 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:29.199
 and then 

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:31.779
 if you put him in the water, for example 

00:03:31.779 --> 00:03:33.659
 still 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:35.289
 the camera 

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:37.919
 regardless of horror 

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:41.109
 The two Schenk axes are characterized by these teardrop-shaped 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:43.339
 Buttons 

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:45.310
 an animal was too big yes 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.589
 after the turn, Jesus is loose and firm 

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:51.419
 us was when you dress properly 

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:53.090
 to Bernd Westhoff 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.849
 in the keys percent recess 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:57.509
 like that 

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:59.739
 both buttons are like that 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:00.979
 appropriate 

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:02.119
 that she 

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:06.460
 Open top down are also very thoughtful as I think 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.459
 Jamal Shuler can still feel in which direction 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:10.719
 you have to give 

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:12.759
 bi-chairman so attached 

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:15.199
 that she never 

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:18.670
 the cash-back many go out here Rees horizontal 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:23.190
 the legal in here have clamped around I take him in with the button Enke 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.430
 the cross may come 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.430
 around 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.659
 the head is delivered by Arcor with a stell couplings 

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:37.309
 this is compatible with two systems not the classic Arcor 

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:41.069
 Rail system and so the new narrow system of Arcor 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.680
 Percent the new narrow rails are primarily for little heads to whom 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.360
 p0 provided 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.759
 but percent unfortunately no longer compatible, of course, also prepare 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:55.139
 but how do they fit in with us? 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:59.520
 The fast pairing mechanism has two stages so it is completely closed 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.900
 with the button 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.370
 Pull back man can be met on one level 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.599
 that's normal now 

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:11.129
 a sheen has been lying around since i push him i want to do that dpa 

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:14.159
 So they come in and push their talk 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:15.319
 closed 

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:18.770
 Seebohm stuck 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:22.439
 and when one thinks to open a purchase completely one must do so 

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:24.449
 the hidden here 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:28.680
 pull the button by the knob and then you can take all the shots 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.680
 then I can take that up too 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.990
 Clutch can be for different 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.360
 substation 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.860
 Mosser be adapted by different manufacturers for this is one here 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.030
 small screw 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:47.389
 but the man then such a shit Randerath and how to turn 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:52.490
 you have to be very excited in front of this one called the boss of 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:53.249
 Evil off 

00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:56.439
 otherwise there is no need for everything 

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:59.229
 and so always hold on but act 

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:00.379
 the 

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:02.400
 settings 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.050
 learning requires 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.869
 otherwise no other tools or the like 

00:06:07.869 --> 00:06:11.329
 is as far as I can tell so far my shortly after foul 

00:06:11.329 --> 00:06:12.529
 of two days 

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:14.009
 for reliable 

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:17.870
 But how can you say it can only be at a healthy level of stress 

00:06:17.869 --> 00:06:21.289
 now, for example, his percent had only 

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:24.849
 The cash register can also be very similar to body dimensions 

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:28.969
 but if, for example, you have Arno Flex Klatten 

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:33.430
 like this one for this, this quick release is now way too far 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:35.550
 and they just fall out 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:39.240
 now of course you could adapt it by including on the measure 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.750
 of the No Fool experts that is of course only vändelbar if one 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:47.000
 either Ruderman is traveling communities at the same time several plates 

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.509
 Wants to use systems 

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:51.509
 is the little SUV hard to use 

00:06:52.619 --> 00:06:56.069
 So that was the cube from Arcor 

00:06:56.069 --> 00:07:00.940
 «A very thoughtful head very sturdy very sturdy to adjust very nicely 

00:07:00.939 --> 00:07:02.560
 a work 

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.029
 masters Merk 

00:07:04.029 --> 00:07:05.830
 you could say that too 

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:09.039
 unfortunately anything but cheap 

00:07:09.039 --> 00:07:11.039
 percent 

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:12.599
 somehow every penny worth
