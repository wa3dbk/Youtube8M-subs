00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:05.759
 what's up, stay, I'm a young wing 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.430
 we are in when with head we are in 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.430
 rebel transmission with the n4 16 in the 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:15.210
 Chinese side I take you with a look that I do not 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:17.310
 cobra is angled year started and the 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.560
 laser and the Russian side goes out there and what 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.240
 more confident that right now we see a 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.180
 to cross though that's what the 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.950
 let's find face 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.770
 go crosses one for her in the background 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:30.020
 crossing three cross what we will do 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:33.370
 obviously try to gain angle towards 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:35.600
 towards them and try to catch them by the 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.480
 side look that the first one works 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.790
 is on top of the building 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.470
 we are going to try to raise it to see if with a 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:47.210
 little of that he has not seen us and 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:50.120
 we can catch him in a 1 weather I have 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.190
 eaten of miracle my mother then let's go 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.600
 cure the one that would have been here with little 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.310
 really life with the drama 'the sun' 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.160
 behind first because the front because 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.930
 do not stop much bad we have three here 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.780
 I've killed two I'm missing one has little 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.980
 life would play ok we had had 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.800
 we must admit that we had a 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.960
 little luck but it has come out in it 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.420
 you see the play around here we have a 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.970
 couple no no no no no no no ok we are 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.009
 giving from the other building minimap 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.590
 it looks like a lot of people are coming 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.869
 around here and we here are 20 from 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.390
 life is going to be if we can heal a 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:25.460
 little and we recharged 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.350
 it seems to me that down but controlled in 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.330
 my team pretty much let's see if 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:33.000
 I can go up here and it seems that they are 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:35.540
 in the building in front it's worth 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.540
 ah 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.160
 I really do not know where it came from 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.550
 because I was looking at all the sides and 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:46.700
 I do not know if it has come up just when 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.980
 when I stopped looking 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.010
 humiliated and I want to know what to 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.360
 sometimes sometimes it happens sometimes though 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.180
 let's try to make all the decisions 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.850
 correct possible, well, this is what happens 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:02.270
 kind of things so I have a little 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.590
 below me or up at least because it's 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.380
 in my file for what I do not know is where 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.270
 is 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.780
 so we have one that is in 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:13.480
 Remosa minimap 100 is what can 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.940
 do not have to worry 184 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.680
 neither 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.140
 and now let's see where it is something else or 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.630
 what comes out really is not 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.210
 it's not good spam because there are enough 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.850
 snipers and others with which 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.410
 us with the m 4 and 16 from such a long 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.220
 distance because it is not that we have 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.590
 a lot to do 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.020
 I prefer to try to get a little closer and 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.340
 be a little more cautious let's see 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.410
 where are they all, it looks like they are 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.350
 in the building before it is in the 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.020
 window that we have to another really does not 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.700
 we are in the best position in the world 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:47.640
 let's leave here because right now 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:51.940
 as it is the dad we are surrounded to be 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:55.000
 absolutely surrounded by all 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.130
 so what I will do is try for 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.620
 a side I'm going to choose the side of 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.210
 the left that is one of those that most 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.570
 like not to say the one I like the most 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:06.700
 to to surround and that they are watching me 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:09.280
 from the house I would swear but well it seems 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.960
 that we have managed to get where 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.840
 we wanted to get him from here 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.400
 let's see what we do like that with a little 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.819
 of luck do not forget us why 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:21.400
 they leave us alone even if we cure 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:25.689
 my goal will be to go directly to the 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:27.740
 building of this vale 1 - same so that 

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:30.450
 not this 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:35.150
 for ccoo just 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.150
 to the door 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:41.480
 I was very touched of life 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.890
 really with so little life at best that 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.870
 I could have done I would like to close the 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.340
 door and try to leave while the 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.980
 Exit will open the door to 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:52.120
 enter the container and I also think that I have 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.549
 been the most successful decision but good 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:58.040
 the din of battle did not give me 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:04:00.469
 time to think that the 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.659
 the best decision is really to that tea 

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:04.640
 Life is only minimally well as 

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:09.819
 obviously you have all but all 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.819
 to lose as well as you do 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:17.530
 we have killed one another assistance 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:20.380
 I'll try not to shoot because there's a lot 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.060
 people around here but good shot but 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.650
 I will try to climb the building without doing 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.580
 a lot of noise but we have already killed 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.930
 two 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.930
 I suppose being on the minimap 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:35.009
 on the map is that it is full of people in 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:38.580
 the map but pomegranate 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:41.219
 it touched him he is touched of life I am not going to 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.770
 wish you because there are many people 

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:45.779
 around here and it really seems like the best 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.330
 idea I prefer to have a little control 

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:50.669
 from my area of ​​the map this area left 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:53.159
 and from here, my mother, the one that 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:56.039
 I hope a lot if Mexico shares 

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:59.249
 gmexico return to be what we put in 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:05:01.349
 now there were two months groping grenades 

00:04:59.249 --> 00:05:03.270
 it then I'll take my chances and I will 

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:06.119
 try to turn them around let's see if 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.129
 we got it appears that the time it 

00:05:06.119 --> 00:05:09.779
 we are getting now I pyro 

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:12.180
 I'm going to flip them directly 

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:13.780
 it's a kleim now let's see if 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.910
 we get 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.350
 Well obviously they are going to hear this 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:20.890
 but good 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:24.110
 I prefer to heal, I have four bullets 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:25.850
 my mother how am I really we are 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.110
 in a pretty fucking mothers position and 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:29.950
 women from my support support team 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.950
 of support about me 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:42.510
 all my team and I think the first one that 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:45.210
 let 's see is a doctor because we have the 16th 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:47.370
 which is of bursts really is not of my 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.960
 favorites so not to say that the weapons of 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.910
 burst I do not like them because I do not 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.160
 please but because I am very bad with 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:54.810
 them and that's why it took quite a few 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.760
 that is, how do you see one face with 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:58.070
 how human I am with those with weapons 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.050
 to bursts 

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.620
 with a bit of luck, you have to 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.570
 say it 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.780
 we got to try to get to the other 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:05.780
 building 

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:11.490
 comes from before 

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:13.470
 there it was happening to me that has decided to upload 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:15.600
 above that is what we will do 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:18.330
 get on the other side and try 

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:20.220
 kill him this was not a great record 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:22.229
 I do not think it's too far from here 

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:25.169
 they really have to improve the sky mine 

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:27.960
 do not hit pineapple fails I just ate 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:30.830
 to see if it comes through here and we get 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.830
 give you three many 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:36.539
 I really do not know if I'm happy or you know 

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:38.220
 bad that the map is finished because 

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:40.800
 I really do not know if I would have killed him 

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:42.510
 much this candle I think I think he 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.930
 I would have killed him but still 

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:46.699
 let's give him the benefit of the doubt 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:48.259
 let's see how we are doing 

00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:49.610
 I would swear that only dead twice I will have 

00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:53.150
 killed about twenty 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:56.330
 good increase 22 is not our bad 

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:59.090
 I would say so well this I hope that you 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:02.410
 have liked the video and see you in 

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:02.410
 another are people see you later
