00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:05.060
 Welcome to the game SV Darmstadt 98 against the Spielvereinigung 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.180
 Greuther Fürth 2 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.210
 the small shamrocks from Franconia arrive with proud breasts 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.400
 Böllenfalltor won the table 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.980
 and even in the last session the Fürth were a tough nut here 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.400
 but also our men around Zivojin Juskic Do not stumble 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.850
 hide clearly on the rise, the lilies are unbeaten since three matchdays 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.160
 and this time is the second home win ago 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.550
 after the 3 2 1 against Wohlen 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.230
 our lines start extremely confidently and even though it is in here 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.310
 Conclusion still haperte one felt the want here today necessarily a threesome 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.420
 Frenz Schaeffler tries to work here Lenzen refuses 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.000
 Tom quarters back 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.540
 but also playing strong with and so a lively game develops 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.620
 at Böllenfalltor 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.780
 the Darmstädter in forward gear Hessel plays her brilliant Zeitler free 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.650
 The situation seems clear at first 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.330
 the ball comes into the penalty area and is good luck you have a goal 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.330
 Eon to many viewers complain but in slow motion you can see him 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.280
 Just fist the ball away and Florian Uhl can not dissolve 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.560
 a clash that luckily nobody was hurt 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.430
 continues 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.600
 again a wonderful passing game of lilies 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.600
 The ball has come to be surreal 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.960
 Wikileaks 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.380
 the next scene for tongue-nipping 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.840
 he should get the ball 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.150
 and what does he do more here just fights off Doha 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.260
 one to zero 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
 madness 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.560
 the strong Sven Seidler 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.899
 Parted her old self-esteem of the world 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:53.359
 and crowns his performance with the one to zero for our lilies 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.750
 but that was not all 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.060
 in the next scene, the Darmstädter combine nicely in the 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.280
 Penalty of the Fürth 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.770
 New recruit Maximilian Mehring is on hand 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.770
 2 0 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.569
 Mehring a blessing for the lilies 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:12.740
 we have brilliant with Sven Sökler 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.740
 and gives the crew and structure 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.409
 2 0-residue despite good play that the Fürth naturally and so 

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:24.800
 At the end of the first half, they still play for the first goal 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.800
 but he was denied them 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:35.479
 then they were over for the first 45 minutes of their lilies 

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:38.479
 Spectators have not offered a holiday strong performance 

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:44.639
 and so we went in the second passage, the lilies almost with the 14 0 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:49.109
 and one but this afternoon completely satisfied every coach Zivojin 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:51.539
 Sketch there 

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:52.999
 Army would 

00:02:52.999 --> 00:02:55.189
 it could already and how it went 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:58.319
 and second half have been played forward 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:01.139
 you could already me 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:04.979
 maybe one or two goals scored maybe with the third goal 

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:07.359
 every player as well as Arno 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:10.359
 not yet 

00:03:12.249 --> 00:03:14.249
 or maybe her 

00:03:14.249 --> 00:03:16.889
 again by Florian a 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:18.359
 not even this time 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:19.969
 Next try 

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:21.839
 The ball is also surprised again 

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:24.839
 he is lying outside 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.330
 pushes the ball in the middle but passes are too late or what is that 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.699
 the referee pointed to the penalty spot 

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:35.790
 and also the stadium visitors are surprised what was going on 

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:39.439
 the slow motion reveals it is being pushed 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:42.109
 the 12 logically 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:45.699
 Soriano grabs the ball and starts but his shot parried the ball 

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:48.699
 Fürth goalkeeper one on 2 0 

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:52.469
 are 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.730
 You will find two lectures here 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.469
 One last Google did it work 

00:03:58.469 --> 00:04:00.639
 Unfortunately, this was not 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:04.649
 important that is too much for me every function Well then but still missing 

00:04:04.649 --> 00:04:07.029
 what exactly is the 3 2 by so 

00:04:07.029 --> 00:04:09.499
 careful 

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:12.299
 Soriano praises himself right here 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:16.039
 and instead of shooting himself, the disinterested one gets up 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:18.180
 3 c minor for our stores 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.409
 and at the same time the final score 

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:24.949
 The lilies can inspire their audience this afternoon 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:27.969
 and convince with a team performance we are here for 

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:30.969
 has not seen for a long time 

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:40.249
 She obviously liked that 

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:23.159
 Brennberg 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:42.589
 and the audience honored the offered Flex Fleming before which
