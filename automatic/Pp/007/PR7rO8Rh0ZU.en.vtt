00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:09.000
 in order for us to catch a plug 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:12.059
 cook bait 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 we need to have in our arsenal 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:20.130
 a whole range of elements 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.609
 this set of buckets means it doesn't matter what 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.000
 firms 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.000
 very comfortable and a bucket capacity of 40 liters 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:34.370
 either 25 liters bucket 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:37.410
 either 17 liters as in competitions 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.020
 the volume of the finished hillock is allowed 17 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.620
 liters it is better to have 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:49.829
 17 liter bucket so as not to have long 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:52.739
 talk judge sieve reckoning it 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.899
 can have several pieces of large sieve 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.899
 depending on the faction bait 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:01.020
 which use a fine sieve for that 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:08.159
 to grind the bait in the process 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:11.189
 preparations for today 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.520
 the bulk of the athletes switched from 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.740
 manually mixing the bait 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:22.409
 mechanically using a mixer 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:24.689
 and the screwdriver who leads him and him 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:29.700
 they do not need a screwdriver 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:32.939
 very powerful so how to interfere 34 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.850
 kilogram bait needed 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:39.030
 make a good effort so when 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.369
 choosing a screwdriver means a screwdriver 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:46.770
 should get a powerful voltage today 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:49.110
 absolutely not very critical but to 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.390
 he was powerful it on this need to pay 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:57.149
 attention how is this done we will show in 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:59.759
 Further, where does any one begin? 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.460
 fishing any fishing begins with 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.130
 cooking bait now we 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.789
 tell you how we do bait for 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.160
 catching the plug on the current in order to 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.410
 feed mixture 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:17.580
 engorged with water it needs 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.680
 certain time accordingly we 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.020
 first we start cooking 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.410
 prikormochnaya mixture light for 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.730
 prikormochnaya mixture will begin to draw water 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.330
 soak up coming to work 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.640
 state 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:33.210
 and at this moment we will deal 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:38.790
 other things we will lay out 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:41.630
 plug chair whales and in the process of layout 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:45.260
 equipment we will return to 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:47.580
 funny prikormki add water 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:52.140
 stir wipe if it is 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:53.870
 it is necessary but it is necessary to begin as if all 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:58.100
 process from prikormki 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:08.240
 accordingly we take bait 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:08.240
 pour out her big bucket big bucket 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:14.700
 mix it again 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:21.600
 take the next step to the left pour 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:23.930
 water pour water pour this into it 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.930
 water 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:38.770
 flavoring stir Stir mountain 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:41.350
 you need to clearly know what amount of bait 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:44.650
 you will knead and how much for this 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:47.800
 the volume of prikormki need water for 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:51.520
 all tanks that you use 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:54.520
 they must be of a certain size and 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:57.030
 you are working with them through some kind of 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:59.830
 time will be 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.959
 know clearly if you need to mix 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.790
 two kilograms bait how much for 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:06.010
 need this water if you need to mix 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:10.660
 4 kilograms of bait how much for this 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:12.330
 need water so our flavoring is already 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:17.430
 we are now dispersed 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:19.840
 Pour the first portion of water into our mix and 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:23.549
 mechanically mix and 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.549
 let's see what happens 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:38.940
 here somewhere a third of the water I fill 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.940
 bait and start to interfere 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:21.960
 Here we poured 1 serving of water and and now 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:24.980
 stirred prikormka we got on 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:30.900
 first look very crumbly 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:33.660
 but this is only the first stage we gave in 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:36.990
 will continue to use use 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:40.010
 the water that was left somewhere else two 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:41.370
 times but before you leave the bait 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:45.390
 to swell 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:52.820
 we have something else to do now we will take 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:56.160
 a smaller bucket we take the sieve is necessary and 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:06:04.350
 sift this bait and see what 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:09.740
 what turned out now we pour bait 

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:09.740
 and start to eat it means 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:19.810
 Here we see the whole bait which 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:22.599
 failed through something through a sieve she 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:24.580
 principle ok but turned out 

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:29.979
 a small number of these 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:34.240
 very sticky balls if it is now it 

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:37.500
 do not rub these balls through a fish sieve 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:39.539
 further after the collapse of the lump in water 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:42.069
 will these balls 

00:06:39.539 --> 00:06:45.009
 they will seek out in the water 

00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:49.449
 these balls fish will seek them out 

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:52.770
 they are first and foremost so we all 

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:54.870
 it carefully carefully carefully 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:57.340
 grind through a sieve 

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:59.669
 large factions that we left them 

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.669
 simply 

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:24.780
 exactly even repeat all these lumps 

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:24.780
 fray large fraction to blame 

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:53.380
 here we see lumps even turns out 

00:07:48.130 --> 00:08:00.910
 very large therefore it is very important that 

00:07:53.380 --> 00:08:00.910
 such tanks at the bottom have not been well it
