to charge it and it also has a built in
gyro<00:00:35.309> which<00:00:35.700> results<00:00:36.180> in<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.360> very<00:00:36.390> stable

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
gyro which results in a very stable

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.910 
gyro which results in a very stable
light<00:00:38.030> it's<00:00:39.030> super<00:00:39.870> lightweight<00:00:40.110> it<00:00:40.680> weighs

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
light it's super lightweight it weighs

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.799 
light it's super lightweight it weighs
in<00:00:41.250> at<00:00:41.520> about<00:00:41.640> four<00:00:42.239> point<00:00:42.750> four<00:00:42.960> ounces<00:00:43.590> and

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
in at about four point four ounces and

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.779 
in at about four point four ounces and
despite<00:00:45.809> its<00:00:46.020> size<00:00:46.670> it's<00:00:47.670> super<00:00:48.210> stable<00:00:48.480> and

despite its size it's super stable and

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:52.520 
despite its size it's super stable and
it's<00:00:50.789> just<00:00:51.270> slightly<00:00:51.539> larger<00:00:52.230> than<00:00:52.260> the

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
it's just slightly larger than the

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.090 
it's just slightly larger than the
world's<00:00:52.890> smallest<00:00:53.399> copter<00:00:54.440> RC<00:00:55.440> helicopter

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
world's smallest copter RC helicopter

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.930 
world's smallest copter RC helicopter
and<00:00:56.480> it's<00:00:57.480> stability<00:00:57.870> size<00:00:58.770> weight<00:00:59.460> make<00:00:59.789> it

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
and it's stability size weight make it

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.399 
and it's stability size weight make it
perfect<00:01:00.359> for<00:01:00.629> indoor<00:01:01.500> flight<00:01:02.809> it<00:01:03.809> does<00:01:04.110> use

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
perfect for indoor flight it does use

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.219 
perfect for indoor flight it does use
infrared<00:01:05.100> so<00:01:05.820> it's<00:01:06.240> not<00:01:06.540> really<00:01:07.049> good<00:01:07.200> for

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
infrared so it's not really good for

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.590 
infrared so it's not really good for
outside<00:01:07.830> because<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.610> sunlight<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.330> its

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
outside because of the sunlight and its

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.469 
outside because of the sunlight and its
size<00:01:10.580> we<00:01:11.580> make<00:01:11.790> it<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:11.939> little<00:01:12.119> bit<00:01:12.270> difficult

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
size we make it a little bit difficult

helicopter itself needs to charge for
about<00:01:25.259> 35<00:01:25.950> minutes<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.640> then<00:01:26.909> from<00:01:27.240> that

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
about 35 minutes and then from that

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.890 
about 35 minutes and then from that
you'll<00:01:27.600> get<00:01:27.780> about<00:01:27.900> five<00:01:28.409> minutes<00:01:28.799> of<00:01:28.950> flight

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
you'll get about five minutes of flight

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.390 
you'll get about five minutes of flight
pros<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.579> cyma<00:01:32.579> six<00:01:32.970> mini<00:01:33.299> copter<00:01:33.780> are

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
pros to the cyma six mini copter are

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.420 
pros to the cyma six mini copter are
amazing<00:01:35.400> stability<00:01:36.000> considering<00:01:36.659> its<00:01:36.810> size

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
amazing stability considering its size

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.730 
amazing stability considering its size
its<00:01:38.430> speed<00:01:39.210> is<00:01:39.509> pretty<00:01:39.810> fast<00:01:40.200> considering

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
its speed is pretty fast considering

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.819 
its speed is pretty fast considering
again<00:01:41.220> how<00:01:41.369> tiny<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:41.880> is<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:43.259> has<00:01:43.380> strong

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
again how tiny it is and it has strong

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.389 
again how tiny it is and it has strong
durable<00:01:44.250> bleeds<00:01:45.079> it's<00:01:46.079> also<00:01:46.290> good<00:01:46.829> for<00:01:47.100> both

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
durable bleeds it's also good for both

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.880 
durable bleeds it's also good for both
beginners<00:01:47.700> as<00:01:48.299> well<00:01:48.329> as<00:01:48.630> expert<00:01:49.380> pilots<00:01:51.890> it's

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
beginners as well as expert pilots it's

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.130 
beginners as well as expert pilots it's
only<00:01:53.159> about<00:01:53.369> 18<00:01:53.909> dollars<00:01:54.270> or<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.570> cost<00:01:54.810> is

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
only about 18 dollars or the cost is

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.550 
only about 18 dollars or the cost is
great<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.680> I<00:01:56.250> like<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.579> lot<00:01:57.170> cons<00:01:58.170> would

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
great and I like a lot cons would

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.310 
great and I like a lot cons would
include<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.549> controller<00:02:00.329> is<00:02:00.689> relatively

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
include the controller is relatively

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.359 
include the controller is relatively
small<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.390> the<00:02:03.390> infrared<00:02:03.869> limits<00:02:04.500> how<00:02:04.740> far<00:02:05.070> it

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
small and the infrared limits how far it

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.469 
small and the infrared limits how far it
can<00:02:05.640> fly<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:07.520> it<00:02:08.520> requires<00:02:08.970> you<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.149> fly<00:02:09.420> it

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
can fly and it requires you to fly it

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.070 
can fly and it requires you to fly it
indoors

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.809 

because<00:02:13.080> it<00:02:13.440> is<00:02:13.560> difficult<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.160> fly<00:02:14.280> in<00:02:14.610> the

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
because it is difficult to fly in the

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.390 
because it is difficult to fly in the
sunlight<00:02:15.270> so<00:02:15.599> overall<00:02:16.170> it's<00:02:16.650> a<00:02:16.800> great<00:02:16.920> copter

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
sunlight so overall it's a great copter

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.510 
sunlight so overall it's a great copter
and<00:02:17.430> I<00:02:17.670> would<00:02:17.819> highly<00:02:18.120> recommend<00:02:18.150> it<00:02:22.340> if<00:02:23.340> you
