 for 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.650
 2 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.240
 with the Pyrenees for decor a 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.829
 new training mission sachets 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.419
 for the crews of the 5th Regiment 

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:24.220
 fighter helicopters in afghanistan 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:25.840
 in mali in central africa 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.579
 it is this framework they are of all 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.230
 outdoor projections of france and 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:31.210
 it is here that they are taught the 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.489
 air techniques in combat including on 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.370
 this tactical simulator or six crews 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:38.230
 can lead a common mission 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.719
 the target is in one of three vehicles 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.550
 apparently there are three pick up two 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:43.899
 pick up white a dark pick-up color 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.329
 to define the mission 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:48.370
 the part between two tigers and two 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:50.260
 maneuver helicopters the goal 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.760
 to intercept the vehicle to stop the 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.819
 vehicle and make a deposit of 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.739
 commandos for the capture and the end 

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:57.129
 the authentication of the target the 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:58.749
 capture 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:00.729
 during the simulation exercise 

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:02.260
 the instructor modified at any time the 

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:03.370
 scenario and the reactions of different 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.340
 mission actors 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.170
 objective the acquisition of automatisms if 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.000
 we lack training if we do not know 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.280
 well prepared and well there we lose 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.250
 a lot of capacity in situation of 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.630
 fight under stress we have less 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.150
 of branches to hang on 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.590
 the situation is 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.150
 specific interventions that are 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.770
 also life-size tested 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.780
 building on already conducted missions 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.340
 in the field as the capture of one 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:31.990
 leaders of an armed terrorist group in 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:35.050
 mali to wait for them to move for 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.790
 identify the vehicle a tiger's 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.620
 cougar and members of the support group 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.780
 are mobilized and must 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.220
 coordinate their actions an exercise on 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.120
 tiger to stop the vehicle and 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.920
 secure the area 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.460
 cougars for the projection of 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.460
 ground crews 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.790
 the reality is we 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.330
 but how do you get off the war of 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.910
 brands 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.500
 and well landed in cant all these 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.660
 mechanical talks side of Antwerp where 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.000
 are the others 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.360
 the redoubt they show troops 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.580
 on the ground 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.330
 he will try to take into account the target 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.069
 and theirs as soon as they have mastered 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.230
 the cip is ready for the phase of 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.670
 recovery will occur we are at 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.630
 proximity needs to empty of three 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.050
 hours 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:42.320
 the third derby inhabitants share 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:44.120
 35 hours of waiting in vrp back to the 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.920
 base always drunk tiger escort 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.310
 responsible for securing the term mission 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.080
 of an operation in any real point of 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.810
 things that are traditionally played 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.820
 on Malian theaters for example 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.770
 actually was already played and we 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.720
 train just for the start 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.320
 next regiment to raise 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.600
 crews thing 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.520
 this permanent watch of the crews of the 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:08.230
 5th district is a real asset for 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.230
 the effectiveness of aero combat
