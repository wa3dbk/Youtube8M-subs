tunnel with Lance what we wanted to do
was<00:00:15.290> start<00:00:15.590> out<00:00:15.830> with<00:00:16.220> a<00:00:16.460> baseline<00:00:16.970> position

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:17.720 
was start out with a baseline position

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.670 
was start out with a baseline position
we<00:00:18.170> were<00:00:18.350> looking<00:00:18.740> at<00:00:20.260> you<00:00:21.260> know<00:00:21.380> let's<00:00:21.529> take

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:21.680 
we were looking at you know let's take

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.640 
we were looking at you know let's take
his<00:00:21.939> 2005<00:00:22.939> position<00:00:23.480> and<00:00:23.660> modify<00:00:24.590> it

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:24.650 
his 2005 position and modify it

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.249 
his 2005 position and modify it
primarily<00:00:25.279> looking<00:00:25.849> at<00:00:26.180> hand<00:00:27.050> positions<00:00:28.029> and

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:29.259 
primarily looking at hand positions and

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:32.740 
primarily looking at hand positions and
how<00:00:30.259> that<00:00:30.500> would<00:00:30.680> affect<00:00:31.070> his<00:00:31.669> his<00:00:32.390> drag

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
how that would affect his his drag

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.810 
how that would affect his his drag
coefficient<00:00:33.649> see<00:00:33.770> we<00:00:34.480> looked<00:00:35.480> at<00:00:36.820> three

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
coefficient see we looked at three

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.689 
coefficient see we looked at three
different<00:00:38.270> positions<00:00:38.530> tested<00:00:39.530> those<00:00:39.710> looked

00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:40.699 
different positions tested those looked

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:45.069 
different positions tested those looked
at<00:00:40.850> how<00:00:41.000> that<00:00:41.440> looked<00:00:42.440> on<00:00:42.680> his<00:00:43.120> 2005<00:00:44.120> bike<00:00:44.420> and

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079 
at how that looked on his 2005 bike and

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:51.959 
at how that looked on his 2005 bike and
his<00:00:45.379> new<00:00:45.920> bike<00:00:46.219> for<00:00:48.850> 2008<00:00:49.850> and<00:00:50.179> also<00:00:51.019> for

Lance has challenges is an athlete in
the<00:00:59.749> aerodynamic<00:01:00.530> position<00:01:00.949> the<00:01:01.070> time<00:01:01.280> trial

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:01.519 
the aerodynamic position the time trial

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:03.939 
the aerodynamic position the time trial
position<00:01:01.969> because<00:01:02.480> he<00:01:03.230> has<00:01:03.320> a<00:01:03.379> big<00:01:03.559> hump<00:01:03.800> in

position because he has a big hump in
his<00:01:04.070> back<00:01:04.280> which<00:01:04.640> actually<00:01:04.840> doesn't<00:01:05.840> serve

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
his back which actually doesn't serve

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.840 
his back which actually doesn't serve
him<00:01:06.170> very<00:01:06.409> well<00:01:06.710> from<00:01:06.920> an<00:01:07.100> aerodynamic

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
him very well from an aerodynamic

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.460 
him very well from an aerodynamic
standpoint<00:01:09.730> we<00:01:10.730> looked<00:01:10.970> at<00:01:11.200> boosting<00:01:12.200> his

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
standpoint we looked at boosting his

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.860 
standpoint we looked at boosting his
hands<00:01:13.130> up<00:01:13.280> so<00:01:13.670> he<00:01:13.790> actually<00:01:14.120> sort<00:01:14.480> of<00:01:14.570> hiding

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:14.870 
hands up so he actually sort of hiding

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.970 
hands up so he actually sort of hiding
behind<00:01:15.140> his<00:01:15.680> hands<00:01:16.540> in<00:01:17.540> essence<00:01:18.020> as<00:01:18.200> he's

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:18.980 
behind his hands in essence as he's

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.490 
behind his hands in essence as he's
riding<00:01:19.490> we<00:01:20.300> looked<00:01:20.540> at<00:01:20.690> that<00:01:20.840> we<00:01:21.140> looked<00:01:21.380> at

riding we looked at that we looked at
more<00:01:21.740> of<00:01:21.770> a<00:01:21.890> flat<00:01:22.220> hand<00:01:22.640> position<00:01:23.440> we<00:01:24.440> looked

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
more of a flat hand position we looked

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.780 
more of a flat hand position we looked
at<00:01:24.860> how<00:01:25.070> we<00:01:25.100> could<00:01:26.200> drop<00:01:27.200> his<00:01:27.500> his<00:01:27.920> chin<00:01:28.430> his

lets you just pull down we looked at all
these<00:02:53.280> different<00:02:54.020> positions<00:02:55.020> on<00:02:55.230> the<00:02:55.290> bike

these different positions on the bike

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.930 
these different positions on the bike

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
and we're able to come up with some

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.880 
and we're able to come up with some
conclusions<00:03:00.120> that<00:03:00.720> we<00:03:00.900> think<00:03:01.200> will<00:03:01.380> help<00:03:01.440> him

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
conclusions that we think will help him

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.600

for<00:03:02.600> 2009<00:03:03.800> some<00:03:04.800> of<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:04.980> findings<00:03:05.400> were
