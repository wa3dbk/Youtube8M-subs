SMS<00:02:26.570> app<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:27.110> only<00:02:27.350> thing<00:02:27.530> that<00:02:27.680> this<00:02:27.800> app<00:02:28.010> is

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130

SMS app the only thing that this app is
really<00:02:28.430> missing<00:02:28.640> and<00:02:28.880> I'm<00:02:28.970> not<00:02:29.120> sure<00:02:29.150> why<00:02:29.510> the

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
really missing and I'm not sure why the

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.540 
really missing and I'm not sure why the
developer<00:02:30.140> released<00:02:30.500> it<00:02:30.650> without<00:02:30.800> it<00:02:31.070> is<00:02:31.220> push

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.610 
developer released it without it is push

that's<00:03:30.470> basically<00:03:31.160> the<00:03:32.080> the<00:03:33.080> main<00:03:33.290> gist<00:03:33.650> of

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
that's basically the the main gist of

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.320 
that's basically the the main gist of
the<00:03:34.040> app<00:03:34.160> I'm<00:03:34.490> looking<00:03:34.790> to<00:03:34.910> see<00:03:35.060> if<00:03:35.150> there's

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
the app I'm looking to see if there's

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:36.730 
the app I'm looking to see if there's
anything<00:03:35.570> else<00:03:35.810> in<00:03:36.050> settings<00:03:36.500> that's

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:36.740 
anything else in settings that's

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.170 
anything else in settings that's
imperative<00:03:37.130> and<00:03:37.430> I<00:03:37.490> don't<00:03:37.700> think<00:03:37.910> there

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
imperative and I don't think there

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.390 
imperative and I don't think there
really<00:03:38.330> is<00:03:38.680> it's<00:03:39.680> pretty<00:03:39.980> straightforward

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
really is it's pretty straightforward

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.760 
really is it's pretty straightforward
and<00:03:40.970> simple<00:03:41.150> if<00:03:41.540> you<00:03:41.660> make<00:03:41.840> any<00:03:42.050> changes<00:03:42.470> in

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:42.770 
and simple if you make any changes in

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.110 
and simple if you make any changes in
settings<00:03:43.490> click<00:03:44.360> that<00:03:44.600> refresh<00:03:45.020> button<00:03:45.410> and

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
settings click that refresh button and

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.530 
settings click that refresh button and
it<00:03:47.120> resync<00:03:47.630> sever<00:03:47.870> ething<00:03:48.940> so<00:03:49.940> I<00:03:49.970> mean<00:03:50.390> it's

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
it resync sever ething so I mean it's

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.530 
it resync sever ething so I mean it's
it's<00:03:50.780> pretty<00:03:51.050> simple<00:03:51.380> all<00:03:51.680> together<00:03:51.860> and<00:03:52.540> then

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
it's pretty simple all together and then

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.690 
it's pretty simple all together and then
go<00:03:54.170> back<00:03:54.200> and<00:03:54.380> dial<00:03:54.710> pad<00:03:55.010> one<00:03:55.280> other<00:03:55.430> thing
