00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
not that difficult but the trick is that

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.950 
not that difficult but the trick is that
you<00:00:28.019> need<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.500> have<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:29.130> at<00:00:29.460> least<00:00:29.760> four<00:00:30.179> giant

souls<00:00:31.170> prep<00:00:31.980> five<00:00:32.309> is<00:00:32.520> preferable<00:00:33.059> but<00:00:33.450> I

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
souls prep five is preferable but I

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.569 
souls prep five is preferable but I
thought<00:00:34.200> fighting<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.800> ancient<00:00:35.100> dragon<00:00:35.460> was

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
thought fighting the ancient dragon was

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:36.680 
thought fighting the ancient dragon was
going<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:35.760> be<00:00:35.880> more<00:00:36.090> trouble<00:00:36.329> than<00:00:36.480> it<00:00:36.660> was

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
going to be more trouble than it was

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.319 
going to be more trouble than it was

though you need to be careful because he

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.240 
though you need to be careful because he
will<00:01:06.270> go<00:01:06.479> for<00:01:06.840> I<00:01:07.080> believe<00:01:07.409> if<00:01:07.920> one<00:01:08.070> hit

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
will go for I believe if one hit

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.070 
will go for I believe if one hit
connects<00:01:08.549> he'll<00:01:08.729> try<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:08.939> land<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.630> second<00:01:09.900> one

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.550 
it right after so that will definitely
kill<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.360> if<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.570> first<00:01:12.780> one<00:01:13.020> didn't<00:01:13.350> so

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.050 
don't know what his weaknesses are i
mean<00:01:34.619> i<00:01:34.650> just<00:01:34.920> use<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.159> charcoal<00:01:35.610> pine<00:01:35.850> resin

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
mean i just use the charcoal pine resin

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.640 
mean i just use the charcoal pine resin
which<00:01:36.360> is<00:01:36.479> fire<00:01:36.689> damage<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.350> seemed<00:01:37.590> to

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
which is fire damage and that seemed to

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.990 
which is fire damage and that seemed to
be<00:01:38.250> better<00:01:38.490> than<00:01:38.640> not<00:01:39.060> using<00:01:39.509> it<00:01:39.630> so<00:01:40.909> just<00:01:41.909> to

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
be better than not using it so just to

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.760 
be better than not using it so just to
remind<00:01:42.150> everyone<00:01:42.600> this<00:01:42.869> boss<00:01:43.320> fight<00:01:43.350> is

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
remind everyone this boss fight is

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.530 
remind everyone this boss fight is
actually<00:01:44.159> completely<00:01:44.399> optional<00:01:44.759> you<00:01:45.240> do<00:01:45.360> not

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
actually completely optional you do not

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.139 
actually completely optional you do not
have<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.960> fight<00:01:46.170> him<00:01:46.320> i<00:01:46.470> believe<00:01:46.500> i<00:01:47.040> wanted<00:01:48.030> to

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
have to fight him i believe i wanted to

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.969 
have to fight him i believe i wanted to
do<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.360> though<00:01:48.509> because<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.200> new<00:01:49.380> game+<00:01:49.740> he'll

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
do it though because a new game+ he'll

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.249 
do it though because a new game+ he'll
only<00:01:50.130> be<00:01:50.369> more<00:01:50.549> difficult<00:01:50.790> i<00:01:51.450> mean<00:01:51.840> in<00:01:52.110> this

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
only be more difficult i mean in this

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.780 
only be more difficult i mean in this
playthrough<00:01:52.619> which<00:01:53.070> is<00:01:53.189> my<00:01:53.310> first<00:01:53.549> one<00:01:53.759> I

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
playthrough which is my first one I

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.490 
playthrough which is my first one I
really<00:01:53.970> wanted<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.479> fight<00:01:54.780> every<00:01:55.290> boss

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
really wanted to fight every boss

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.749 
really wanted to fight every boss
possible<00:01:56.159> even<00:01:56.340> all<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.579> optional<00:01:57.119> ones<00:01:57.180> I

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
possible even all the optional ones I

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:01.539 
possible even all the optional ones I
would<00:01:59.759> only<00:01:59.880> go<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.180> heal<00:02:00.479> whenever<00:02:00.960> he

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
would only go to heal whenever he

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:03.740 
would only go to heal whenever he
whenever<00:02:02.549> vendrick<00:02:02.880> swings<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:03.270> sword<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.659> you

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
whenever vendrick swings a sword and you

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.450 
whenever vendrick swings a sword and you
dodge<00:02:03.930> roll<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:04.560> that's<00:02:04.770> normally<00:02:05.159> when<00:02:05.310> you

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
dodge roll and that's normally when you

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.310 
dodge roll and that's normally when you
would<00:02:05.579> squeeze<00:02:05.909> a<00:02:05.939> couple<00:02:06.090> hits<00:02:06.899> in<00:02:07.049> with<00:02:07.170> your

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
would squeeze a couple hits in with your

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.499 
would squeeze a couple hits in with your
sword<00:02:07.619> I<00:02:07.799> would<00:02:08.009> not<00:02:08.190> attack<00:02:08.789> that<00:02:09.030> time<00:02:09.270> and

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
sword I would not attack that time and

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.089 
sword I would not attack that time and
just<00:02:09.660> heal<00:02:10.020> that's<00:02:10.289> probably<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:10.920> safest

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
just heal that's probably the safest

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.760 
just heal that's probably the safest
time<00:02:11.489> to<00:02:11.550> heal

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.410 

and<00:02:15.770> this<00:02:16.069> is<00:02:16.190> basically<00:02:16.370> just<00:02:16.640> a<00:02:16.910> reminder

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
and this is basically just a reminder

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.660 
and this is basically just a reminder
but<00:02:17.780> there<00:02:17.930> are<00:02:18.050> five<00:02:18.319> giant<00:02:18.920> souls<00:02:19.160> that<00:02:19.459> will

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
but there are five giant souls that will

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.220 
but there are five giant souls that will
eat<00:02:19.970> for<00:02:20.180> each<00:02:20.330> soul<00:02:20.599> you<00:02:20.720> have<00:02:20.750> it<00:02:21.110> will

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
eat for each soul you have it will

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.380 
eat for each soul you have it will
reduce<00:02:21.590> vendrick<00:02:22.099> defense<00:02:22.580> by<00:02:22.760> a<00:02:22.790> significant

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
reduce vendrick defense by a significant

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.390 
reduce vendrick defense by a significant
amount<00:02:23.630> so<00:02:24.500> you<00:02:24.560> ideally<00:02:25.010> want<00:02:25.040> to<00:02:25.250> have<00:02:25.370> all

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
amount so you ideally want to have all

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.460 
amount so you ideally want to have all
five<00:02:25.819> but<00:02:26.209> you<00:02:26.420> don't<00:02:26.660> need<00:02:26.930> it<00:02:26.989> I<00:02:27.230> mean<00:02:27.349> I'm

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
five but you don't need it I mean I'm

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.440
