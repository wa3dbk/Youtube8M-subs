00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:08.040
 Tell me guys youtube marshal rambo 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.200
 here back with dashni bringing here 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.980
 tips for you that are in the game you 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.870
 who is entering the game and is with 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.990
 difficulty gaining lumen 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.720
 Who does not know is the game currency is that 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.900
 Bright square here is the coin 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.820
 what we wear is in the game this week 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.260
 having flag of iron the galera that 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.800
 likes to play with the three characters 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:35.219
 likes to get all the armor in this 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:38.160
 You end up spending quite lumen with 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.260
 equipment and weapons now too. 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.440
 in the middle we can strengthen the 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.930
 but it ends up spending a lot of lumen and 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.210
 where I would make the volume for those who did not 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.820
 knows how to steady is the art of 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.120
 same thing is a quick way 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.270
 people you go here in marketing and have 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.780
 the mission here is the exclusion zone 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.629
 This mission here will put you in the 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.820
 level 18 you have to put on the level 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.990
 hard I will explain why 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.970
 we're already starting light is difficult 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.490
 When will you see in life's enemies? 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:19.200
 yellow the enemies of yellow life them 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:21.630
 What gives you enough lumen is for you. 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.810
 this mission is the first mission when 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.990
 people arrive on Mars where we have the 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:31.530
 Our first meeting with the channels is 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.320
 It's raid guys that have enough 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.869
 ascending ascending energy fragment 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.840
 or radiant energy that is given to the radio 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.990
 of Croatian can exchange these objects here 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.509
 and if this one also can change for 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.299
 lumen there in the currency spokesman also 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.340
 Strange can not leave can not give you 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.570
 change these here to these objects here 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.549
 by lumen of here you will have one of the 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.750
 few teams that right does not happen 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:03.719
 Nothing, the sun, our ghost. 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:06.149
 speaking is the first mission here too 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:08.360
 that even better changes in your zone 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.360
 exclusion 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:17.470

 Try to see your friends for you. 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:24.490
 do with three people because you will see 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.980
 enough enemy and your friend finishes 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.410
 killing these enemies you finish 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.480
 gaining volume then with is you talk is 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.780
 much faster 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:38.920
 okay because this is the first mission zinha 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.870
 that demarcates people is going to get there 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.120
 where will we meet our 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.760
 first enemies and there we go 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.670
 to gain a lot of lumen can give people a chance 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.490
 fence here of floripa planets in thing 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:54.100
 five minutes you get around 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.420
 of 1,000 thousand and a few lumen yes it is 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.030
 enough fire 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.580
 I'll show you how you do it. 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.860
 I advise and that is the first place zinho 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:06.820
 we will enter here on the basis of 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:08.500
 ghost cowboys lately only serves 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:12.370
 to open doors and invest to make 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:14.890
 Anything else, beauty, we entered. 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.950
 here looking for something linked to the 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:21.670
 its great guidelines and now it will 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:24.990
 to reach our enemies, the ideal 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:30.160
 It is also up to you to have the 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:32.680
 refill is this from here is this from 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.450
 that allows your ghost connects 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.670
 networks to transmit the realization to 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.950
 catch more lumens enemies hard hard 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.550
 ten minutes so you better use this 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.940
 hence 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:45.430
 in this mission it will give you much more lumen 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.410
 if you do not have no worries 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.260
 do it here once or twice that 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:53.230
 surely your enemies will go 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:56.770
 drop one of these too they leave 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:59.680
 drop them dropa is call network chavez 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:02.140
 which gives 200 lumen giving gives 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:05.710
 collect a lot if you stay here some 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:08.350
 a half an hour you're going to have a 10 said 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:11.140

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:14.410
 enemies that comes will it ends up killing them 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:16.930
 These are the enemies of red life. 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.400
 if you do not have the key with code 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.280

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:48.570
 Look here, look, they did not drop anything. 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:49.919
 network keys or 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:52.229
 replenishment 

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:54.389
 you leave alone talking here that 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:56.520
 which gives less clouds and lets it kill you 

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:59.220
