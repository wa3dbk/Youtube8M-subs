00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.170 
until 12 59am so there is a bell um
roughly<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:31.109> week<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:32.130> half<00:00:32.160> I<00:00:32.669> believe<00:00:32.969> so

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
roughly a week and a half I believe so

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.700 
roughly a week and a half I believe so
around<00:00:33.510> there<00:00:33.719> they<00:00:33.870> used<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.290> keep<00:00:34.500> these

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710
