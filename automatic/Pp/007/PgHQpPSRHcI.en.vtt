00:00:41.279 --> 00:00:41.289 
came out into a boom pole apparently and

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:43.709 
came out into a boom pole apparently and
stand<00:00:41.590> easily<00:00:42.160> but<00:00:42.430> I'm<00:00:42.760> not<00:00:43.300> too<00:00:43.480> sure<00:00:43.629> how

00:00:43.709 --> 00:00:43.719 
stand easily but I'm not too sure how

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:45.420 
stand easily but I'm not too sure how
that<00:00:43.899> would<00:00:43.960> work<00:00:44.020> and<00:00:44.379> obviously<00:00:45.219> it's

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.430 
that would work and obviously it's

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.119 
that would work and obviously it's

yeah<00:00:48.129> just<00:00:48.399> a<00:00:48.489> fairly<00:00:49.090> standard<00:00:49.269> looking<00:00:49.660> box

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
yeah just a fairly standard looking box

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:52.349 
yeah just a fairly standard looking box
doesn't<00:00:50.079> really<00:00:50.289> feel<00:00:50.469> high<00:00:50.680> quality<00:00:51.359> it

00:00:52.349 --> 00:00:52.359 
doesn't really feel high quality it

stopped there OPEC come back here and

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:00.919 
stopped there OPEC come back here and
then<00:00:57.129> just<00:00:57.550> open<00:00:57.760> this<00:00:58.059> box<00:00:58.359> up<00:00:58.660> right<00:00:58.899> now<00:00:59.550> and

00:01:00.919 --> 00:01:00.929 
then just open this box up right now and

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:03.660 
then just open this box up right now and
there's<00:01:01.929> nothing<00:01:02.289> else<00:01:02.800> in<00:01:03.010> the<00:01:03.100> box<00:01:03.309> just

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
there's nothing else in the box just

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.820 
there's nothing else in the box just
this<00:01:03.910> piece<00:01:04.120> of<00:01:04.360> styrofoam<00:01:04.809> which<00:01:05.410> doesn't

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
this piece of styrofoam which doesn't

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.220 
this piece of styrofoam which doesn't
even<00:01:05.860> feel<00:01:06.100> like<00:01:06.160> nice<00:01:06.610> Tyra<00:01:06.910> foam<00:01:07.150> it<00:01:07.900> kind<00:01:08.170> of

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:08.230 
even feel like nice Tyra foam it kind of

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.830 
even feel like nice Tyra foam it kind of
just<00:01:08.380> feels<00:01:08.680> really<00:01:08.950> cheap<00:01:09.280> and<00:01:09.490> gross<00:01:09.840> plus

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
just feels really cheap and gross plus

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.620 
just feels really cheap and gross plus

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
that off there's steel tech instructions

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.450 
that off there's steel tech instructions
on<00:01:13.780> how<00:01:13.810> to<00:01:13.930> operate<00:01:14.500> the<00:01:14.620> microphone<00:01:15.040> if<00:01:15.370> you

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
on how to operate the microphone if you

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:16.650 
on how to operate the microphone if you
don't<00:01:15.610> know<00:01:15.670> how<00:01:15.790> to<00:01:15.850> operate<00:01:15.910> a<00:01:16.210> microphone

don't know how to operate a microphone

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.290 
don't know how to operate a microphone
you<00:01:16.870> probably<00:01:17.200> you<00:01:17.320> should<00:01:17.380> in<00:01:17.620> the<00:01:17.680> bottom

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:18.300 
you probably you should in the bottom

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.180 
you probably you should in the bottom
and<00:01:19.680> here<00:01:20.680> is<00:01:20.980> the<00:01:21.250> actual<00:01:21.400> microphone<00:01:22.150> itself

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 
and here is the actual microphone itself

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.720 
and here is the actual microphone itself
it<00:01:24.190> looks<00:01:24.430> pretty<00:01:24.700> cool<00:01:25.020> there<00:01:26.020> is<00:01:26.290> the<00:01:26.730> 3.5

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:27.730 
it looks pretty cool there is the 3.5

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.620 
it looks pretty cool there is the 3.5
millimeter<00:01:28.060> jack<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:30.130> windscreen<00:01:30.760> and<00:01:31.420> the

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
millimeter jack the windscreen and the

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.500 
millimeter jack the windscreen and the
actual<00:01:31.870> microphone<00:01:32.470> itself<00:01:32.620> it's<00:01:33.010> made

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:33.510 
actual microphone itself it's made

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.620 
actual microphone itself it's made
entirely<00:01:34.510> out<00:01:34.720> of<00:01:34.810> plastic<00:01:36.240> which<00:01:37.240> is<00:01:37.390> kind<00:01:37.600> of

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
entirely out of plastic which is kind of

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.050 
entirely out of plastic which is kind of
what<00:01:37.750> I<00:01:37.780> expected<00:01:38.350> says<00:01:39.130> a<00:01:39.160> petco<00:01:39.670> on<00:01:39.820> the<00:01:39.910> back

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
what I expected says a petco on the back

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.190 
what I expected says a petco on the back
there<00:01:40.270> might<00:01:40.420> be<00:01:40.450> a<00:01:40.540> little<00:01:40.630> bit<00:01:40.810> hard<00:01:40.990> to<00:01:41.050> see

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
there might be a little bit hard to see

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.290 
there might be a little bit hard to see
from<00:01:41.290> that<00:01:41.440> angle<00:01:41.560> and<00:01:41.830> there<00:01:42.580> is<00:01:42.820> the<00:01:42.850> only

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
from that angle and there is the only

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.760 
from that angle and there is the only
switch<00:01:43.690> on<00:01:43.810> the<00:01:43.840> device<00:01:44.110> which<00:01:44.290> is<00:01:44.440> the<00:01:44.560> power

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
switch on the device which is the power

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.470 
switch on the device which is the power
switch<00:01:45.010> I<00:01:45.310> don't<00:01:45.460> have<00:01:45.700> a<00:01:45.790> battery<00:01:46.060> and<00:01:46.330> there

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:46.480 
switch I don't have a battery and there

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.090 
switch I don't have a battery and there
yet<00:01:46.660> it<00:01:46.810> did<00:01:46.930> not<00:01:47.050> come<00:01:47.290> with<00:01:47.500> a<00:01:47.530> battery<00:01:47.710> and

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
yet it did not come with a battery and

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.040 
yet it did not come with a battery and
requires<00:01:48.970> a<00:01:49.060> battery<00:01:49.390> to<00:01:49.480> be<00:01:49.630> powered<00:01:49.900> on<00:01:49.990> and

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
requires a battery to be powered on and

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.920 
requires a battery to be powered on and
this<00:01:50.290> mounts<00:01:50.650> right<00:01:50.710> to<00:01:50.920> the<00:01:51.040> top<00:01:51.630> one<00:01:52.630> thing<00:01:52.870> I

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
this mounts right to the top one thing I

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.690 
this mounts right to the top one thing I
noticed<00:01:53.080> about<00:01:53.230> the<00:01:53.500> gate<00:01:53.680> that<00:01:53.710> is<00:01:54.160> kind<00:01:54.490> of<00:01:54.580> a

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
noticed about the gate that is kind of a

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.700 
noticed about the gate that is kind of a
concern<00:01:55.030> for<00:01:55.060> me<00:01:55.330> is<00:01:55.360> this<00:01:55.750> shock<00:01:56.080> mount<00:01:56.410> it's

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
concern for me is this shock mount it's

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
is through the opec of VMA and I guess

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.540 
is through the opec of VMA and I guess
the<00:02:50.260> phrase<00:02:50.380> will<00:02:50.650> be<00:02:50.739> the<00:02:50.920> quick<00:02:51.190> brown<00:02:51.400> fox

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
ahead and step back a little bit so you

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.009
