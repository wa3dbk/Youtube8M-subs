all day long the key to any recoil rig

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.440 
all day long the key to any recoil rig
is<00:00:13.620> balance<00:00:14.219> and<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.519> most<00:00:14.670> important<00:00:15.269> thing

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
is balance and the most important thing

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.109 
is balance and the most important thing
to<00:00:15.630> remember<00:00:15.690> is<00:00:16.170> that<00:00:16.680> your<00:00:16.859> eye<00:00:17.119> shoulder

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
to remember is that your eye shoulder

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.689 
to remember is that your eye shoulder
and<00:00:18.330> hand<00:00:18.930> placement<00:00:19.230> never<00:00:20.010> change<00:00:20.400> they

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
and hand placement never change they

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.240 
and hand placement never change they
will<00:00:20.820> always<00:00:20.970> be<00:00:21.270> in<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.539> same<00:00:21.750> spot<00:00:22.250> recoil

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
will always be in the same spot recoil
