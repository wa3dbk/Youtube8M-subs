00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:16.079
 Russian cryptography 

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:18.269
 used in modern dance 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:20.730
 particulars were constantine 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.199
 i will start with very simple elements 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.109
 who are strangely very good 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:25.300

 New Year's Eve 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.920
 let's start i will start gradually 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.620
 indicators small 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.220
 and our concern with you workouts we 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.440
 possibly co-owner of such skills 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.130
 and ability to dance 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.820

 3 years is the reason for the press responsibility 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.550
 hospital in any station and my students 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.110
 who are probably watching now 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.590
 screen but it would be nonsense because not 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.480
 I remember that I pay a lot to this 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.790
 element time 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.250
 what we need to 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.150
 master the moment please direct 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.360
 back disclosure rudd definitely not 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.190
 Not one line can be the eighth line with 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.560
 burns the Russian position for any 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.830
 dance and choreography 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.600
 Oriental dance including 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.490
 in order for us without a doubt we must 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.090
 just drop bets 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.360
 that would not sit and wait now I 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.990
 show, he will talk about how is 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.600
 at checkpoints Russians even 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.079
 small but even if asked in the bank 

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:26.930
 back that is to him for the time being a few more 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.240
 hundreds of thousands 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.170
 in other areas 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.250
 table surfaces 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.770
 if there is a client how to use 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.990
 elements of dance of course with dance 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.230
 use more dynamically 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.120
 we can do it 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.010
 and the values ​​of this element 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.070
 will demonstrate France 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.430
 we take a step 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.210
 truth for example all corps said 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.680
 stealing galliano in order to 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.640
 to demonstrate 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.830
 here we want to go real 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.210
 but do if them from time to time 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.130
 open the case are good to be fixed 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.210
 so if it's an element 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.010

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.200
 went down with me first 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.000
 and then bring daily state 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.169

 no matter what you have there to 

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:18.269
 holders further 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.099
 on the eve of it several more times 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:24.099
 but very soft to move 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:27.489
 if you are ready to make this move 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:28.589
