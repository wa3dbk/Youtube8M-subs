00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:06.100
 he is the first to leave 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.519
 Particularly a single sun of both times at several in Italy is number six 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:11.329
 and also number five 

00:00:11.329 --> 00:00:14.539
 that was against for Chinese people, they are the first to try to make it through the bend 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:16.820
 to come because then you are seated 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.980
 to be the first to take up that new job the czech republic martens principle 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.050
 Gertjan's by comes to vomiting abdominal pain seemingly no up to scratch 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.039
 awaiting an eighth ninth place in second place 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.199
 Jo of the works in charge while here 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.869
 the unfortunate ones are among others 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.940
 we are looking at asten's album 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.940
 they can of course forget the victory 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.500
 but I, among others, the number ten gertjan 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.610
 also no hopeful news 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.940
 the particular pity 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.650
 jackie martens with number two in second or third place on the expert 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.010
 strijbos are in front 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.520
 shoot me in second place 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.580
 and at home in first place with starting number a consul multiple 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:53.420
 world champion 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.320
 john van der beck 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.400
 hence the big men from now on in this final in the Ahoy sports palace 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.290
 smoothly over the double jump takes czech martens does not that saw 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:02.600
 the two Netherlands want to do that 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.130
 what i mean i just want all 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:05.059
 loose the battle 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.340
 on the pumping station the new allegri job that is now almost down the stairs 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.340
 out there we sat the market 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.580
 reasonable lead of 100 meters 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.869
 about the new candidate is for the last time 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.730
 can use sport at just about all jumps also two jump 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.400
 in one go and the other two perpetrators do not 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.860
 and then hitters 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.250
 jumps that it is very far in one go 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.810
 about which the post of vote 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.880
 and she immediately at the rear wheel of the caller offers that on the fourth 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.280
 place works with number ten geert jan van doorn in the rear avoiding there 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.280
 just left the leadership of willebrands 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.410
 but the lead 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.300
 it is still ongoing work 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.180
 leads with these two men just behind but this is the little man from the forest 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.590
 then from the band 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.190
 was world champion in the 125cc and 250cc class 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.650
 for fourth and fifth place 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.220
 buddy us with start number 4 just behind the belgians get used to the white 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.710
 and there are two roads that lead to rome 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.870
 that is why we also take a double 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:03.610
 here you see my chance 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.030
 that's where he comes and so he's just the number 5 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.520
 that is, that day were banned 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.659
 so what to Josien to fourth place 

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:12.459
 I am now one of the places where the drivers could catch up with 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:13.729
 multiple hits 

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:16.909
 and those that are slippery becomes slow to go second 

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:19.579
 then from work down again 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:22.749
 we're going to see if the cameraman that you see him in the food through the bend 

00:02:22.749 --> 00:02:24.569
 comes to mind at an almost torpedo 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.859
 he goes up the stairs and that he is there as a result 

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:29.879
 just now just with you either 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:32.829
 and watch now he is going to jump shares first there comes that more tasks takka 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:33.400
 takka takka 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.349
 and down the stairs 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.139
 then the new job 

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:37.219
 it goes out 

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:41.279
 in three months he will no longer be in Rotterdam ahoy that on the spot market 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:46.249
 and we will look at how the battle for leadership is, because tons of birch months 

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:49.799
 now it is just behind geert jan van doren pepe so almost a round none 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:50.669
 to give 

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:53.699
 ted jan van doorn row 

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:54.820
 one of the works is over 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.289
 NB Strijbos Staircase Trademark 

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:59.419
 that said forest can no longer reach it 

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:01.620
 due to a fall of the birch strijbos anyway 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.869
 windows but can of course at hema 

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:07.700
 because being very nice watch the two tenths ate 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.629
 Van Breukelen Strijbos is of course the first to take the blows 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:12.499
 and then one from the birch 

00:03:12.499 --> 00:03:15.769
 and beyond thorn, and he really won't 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.099
 it is not about never overtaking 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:21.279
 here you see that pirouette such a bag again ackers our cameraman it 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:25.150
 of the backs points out immediately if there is of course going to sail 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.409
 picquÃ© if i don't know what 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:29.620
 van doorn beyond great great 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:30.739
 and no more exciting 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:32.149
 this is my sons by the way 

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:35.309
 now in fourth place city just 18 centimeters 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.620
 you see with number two and that is now passing by but it is not inside by so 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.899
 stands against each other 

00:03:42.899 --> 00:03:44.249
 her shoulder yes 

00:03:44.249 --> 00:03:45.279
 japan does not diminish 

00:03:45.279 --> 00:03:47.460
 he first the report while the lambs 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.749
 shoot above that is a fact 

00:03:50.749 --> 00:03:54.539
 third place four and my shows and fifth but art exchange welcome 

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:57.079
 drive work and battle forest 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:00.719
 You work fine and Joos with his far jumps that America the Tiger is one 

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:01.779
 nickname 

00:04:01.779 --> 00:04:05.339
 municipalities bothered and the cats were able to win the leader forest ruling 

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:08.429
 hangs a small step on his motorcycle at the top 

00:04:08.429 --> 00:04:10.509
 he jumps on it again 

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:12.989
 to this end the family has overlooked the storage area should not be crazier 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.419
 are left after b 

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:18.419
 I remembered a song of the works in the lead with 38 with 11 

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:25.069
 financial newspaper 

00:04:25.069 --> 00:04:28.069
 tone of the church that goes it now goes across it 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.930
 keep the picture with, but better still 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.360
 opposition to the lead 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.360
 without work and just behind the competition 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:45.349
 much kidney man joost computer 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:48.569
 Sjekkie Martens with starting number 2 remains open and entered there 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:50.500
 touch look that is jacky martens 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.550
 while inside the white immediately sprint past 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.939
 so Jacky Martens now backwards 

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:57.150
 in europe there was music with a topper 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.520
 train was full in the ahoy sports palace 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.499
 but here again from the road 

00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:04.020
 for the last time it will fall 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.950
 He just took it from the birch I just wanted to say about the last time 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:09.479
 also the double track 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:12.270
 and the stairs on product 200 meters 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.699
 and with that he lost control of the wheel 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:17.699
 we will never check you there 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.900
 I am completely detached from the engine 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:29.009
 unbelievable 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:36.080
 strijbos that comes in second 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.679
 and this man with starting number four market timing even let go 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.170
 audience my son he is at third party that cz huge jump 

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:47.409
 the district 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:49.210
 by a top match against FC Twente 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.960
 bayern 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.960
 it's the first time in his career 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:01.960
 for fighters were killed the four were worldwide coming 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:08.430
 on symbian
