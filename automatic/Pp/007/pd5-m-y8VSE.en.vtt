00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.100
 hello and welcome to my 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.160
 first life i am katja burghardt 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.290
 our extraordinary tv experiment 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.450
 goes to the next round people 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.920
 tell us in a trance from her 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.599
 possible life 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.520
 they will not be there 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.260
 Maybe say so now and so 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.990
 think also the actress xenia 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.029
 seeberg and the casting director rolf 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:26.970
 Scheider and yet the two 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.910
 try under hypnosis in her 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.230
 to travel past 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.660
 admitted that was a lot now 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.390
 nonsense at once but that's how it is 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.809
 just when rtl blonde katja burkard from 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.219
 the leash is left xenia seeberg in 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.050
 Rotenburg in these days 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.059
 she is sure i was with this 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.579
 witch burning while she knows too 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:51.780
 this little church she says here 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:54.590
 I always prayed but that's over 300 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.590
 years ago 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.860
 also rolf scheider casting director and 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.140
 candidate at the rtl show let's dance 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.040
 looks under hypnosis pictures from a 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.500
 past time 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.870
 He sees a glassblower on the island 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.890
 murano in the 16th century and he too 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:14.120
 says i am this man here is mine 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.200
 workplace so a third-rate 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.780
 actress and a crazy 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.790
 So casting could now be witnesses 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.270
 for all of us having lived before 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.180
 to have 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.910
 even if that is the case 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.220
 the title of my first life is nonsense 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.140
 because maybe you have it before 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.220
 ever lived 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.790
 Maybe Katja Burkhard was at the end 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.680
 even eva and rolfe scheider adam but 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.229
 that would mean that we are both of them 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.280
 No, we forget that 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.380
 let's just quickly devote ourselves to the 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.170
 Reputable science Senius recirculation 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.150
 will take three to four hours 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:02:00.149
 Katja and Marc watch everything 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:02:02.250
 a side room in trance describes 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.899
 rolf alias giovanni a special one 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.150
 technique of glass blowing 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:11.110
 I am the glass place master 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:16.870
 i design patterns i do in ours 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:20.170
 factory creation ok cafe you have to 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:23.380
 a lot of glass missing bubbles and 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:26.930
 unbuckle and similar them all 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:31.549
 treat together one night 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:36.170
 you need from the oven, a glass blowing in 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:40.819
 and then you put on this glass piece 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:43.189
 Wood around then there was this technique 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:46.010
 then really can agree what 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:49.250
 Rolf under hypnosis sees this 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.590
 technology at that time really yes they existed 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.239
 and it is well known as before 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.469
 a few hundred years of glassblowing 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.599
 was practiced 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:58.370
 we control one of the local glass 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:00.349
 manufactories want us to 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.019
 production of the murano glass up close 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:07.150
 look and see if rolf this 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.150
 technology maybe even mastered 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:14.630
 kroll 45 o'clock and amazing rolf 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.190
 barely creates a passable glass ball 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.480
 someone succeeds right away without it 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.480
 any knowledge 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:26.400
 yes of bubbles understands what the rolfe 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.400
 Studio 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.220
 that his church 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.290
 who are doing very well 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.550
 still 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:04:01.080
 the child the historian has katja 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.820
 and rolf called the place where else 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.590
 one of the lion head mailboxes too 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.420
 For it is then planning a house wall 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.060
 not far from the marketplace 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.710
 So it really exists today 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.020
 of course, no one else slip in around 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:15.720
 to denounce people 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:18.180
 No, there is the television what 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.760
 you notice what both c promis have 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.410
 Strangely, the place lived in places 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.280
 still almost the same today 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.220
 exist 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.080
 what would rtl have done if woman 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.830
 sieberg seen a church in berlin 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.750
 or otherwise, that would probably be 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.850
 Did not happen because that's here 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.340
 Everything constructed humbug is likely 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:40.140
 be obvious and that's why you have 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.150
 yes, only the last television 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:44.460
 Houses can persuade here at all 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:52.110
 to leave empty spaces we drive the 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:54.630
 Pastor of the St. James Church is in the 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:59.400
 church he wandered around he stood by 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:05:01.170
 1504 to 575 Christian up here 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.790
 Pastor makes such a pancake 

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:07.680
 on the subject of reincarnation with not quite 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:10.470
 Demand from TV criticism TV 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.720
 Passenger guzmÃ¡n revealed that rtl him 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:15.180
 had actually asked about the subject of witches 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.080
 what it really is about where 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.930
 embezzle 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:23.040
 keeps living an earlier of retrieval 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:25.320
 he personally for abstrus giovanni so 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.090
 sees it rolf further piece with beginning 30 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.820
 but not as a victim of some places 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:31.560
 one of the 1000 degrees hot furnaces 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:40.470
 his fatality 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:45.000
 the oven clearly explodes this clear the 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:47.010
 burning glass everywhere rolfe trappers 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.520
 seems bad nightmares too 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:49.350
 to have 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.139
 but everyone would have it on his 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:53.639
 his details have all 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:56.130
 historians can confirm 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:59.010
 Rolf is completely convinced that he is here 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:05.250
 1530 lived as a glass artist giovanni 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:07.470
 his conclusion is so intense is that 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:09.690
 right word because how will it be 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:11.940
 katja burghardt go if you have a few 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:14.010
 should live again for centuries and 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:16.440
 then look back on her present life 

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:19.020
 she will find that she is listed 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:22.110
 or was a bad journalist 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:24.660
 Let's just hope that then the rtl building 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:27.380
 as a place of their past no more 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.380
 there
