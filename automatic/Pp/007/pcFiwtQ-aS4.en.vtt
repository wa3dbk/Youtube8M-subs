on<00:02:43.600> this<00:02:44.350> thing<00:02:44.650> the<00:02:44.830> way<00:02:44.860> it<00:02:45.010> looked<00:02:45.280> before

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
on this thing the way it looked before

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.970 
on this thing the way it looked before
it<00:02:46.150> wouldn't<00:02:46.480> hurt<00:02:46.900> be<00:02:47.170> very<00:02:47.440> beneficial<00:02:47.620> for

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
it wouldn't hurt be very beneficial for

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.220 
it wouldn't hurt be very beneficial for
that<00:02:48.220> sin<00:02:48.580> to<00:02:48.700> itself<00:02:49.090> because<00:02:49.600> his<00:02:49.780> style<00:02:50.080> is

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
that sin to itself because his style is

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.930 
that sin to itself because his style is
a<00:02:50.260> little<00:02:50.470> bit<00:02:50.620> different<00:02:51.070> and<00:02:51.310> he<00:02:51.640> wanted<00:02:51.850> to

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
a little bit different and he wanted to

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.610 
a little bit different and he wanted to
make<00:02:52.030> something<00:02:52.270> more<00:02:52.480> awesome<00:02:52.780> out<00:02:52.900> of<00:02:52.989> it<00:02:53.050> so

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
make something more awesome out of it so

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.310 
make something more awesome out of it so
instead<00:02:53.950> of<00:02:54.160> building<00:02:55.030> on<00:02:55.209> this<00:02:55.420> tattoo<00:02:55.780> he

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
instead of building on this tattoo he

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.140 
instead of building on this tattoo he
created<00:02:56.620> something<00:02:56.770> completely<00:02:57.250> new<00:02:57.459> and<00:02:57.640> put

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
created something completely new and put

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.640 
created something completely new and put
it<00:02:58.239> kind<00:02:58.480> of<00:02:58.510> in<00:02:58.630> the<00:02:58.720> background<00:02:58.900> so<00:02:59.410> it's<00:02:59.560> a

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
it kind of in the background so it's a

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.699 
it kind of in the background so it's a
background<00:03:00.130> piece<00:03:00.370> to<00:03:01.110> the<00:03:02.110> one<00:03:02.290> that<00:03:02.440> I<00:03:02.500> had

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
background piece to the one that I had

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.370 
background piece to the one that I had
before<00:03:02.920> and<00:03:03.310> it<00:03:04.209> kind<00:03:04.630> of<00:03:04.720> makes<00:03:04.959> the<00:03:05.140> old

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
before and it kind of makes the old

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.310 
before and it kind of makes the old
piece<00:03:06.000> disappear<00:03:07.000> into<00:03:07.300> the<00:03:07.600> new<00:03:07.900> piece<00:03:08.110> if

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
piece disappear into the new piece if

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.590 
piece disappear into the new piece if
that<00:03:08.560> makes<00:03:08.739> sense<00:03:08.980> and<00:03:09.220> we're<00:03:09.790> not<00:03:10.060> nearly

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
that makes sense and we're not nearly

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.690 
that makes sense and we're not nearly
finished<00:03:10.840> the<00:03:11.709> other<00:03:11.980> thing<00:03:12.160> he's<00:03:12.310> done<00:03:12.489> now

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.820 
right now and I really like that so if
we<00:04:01.030> take<00:04:01.150> a<00:04:01.209> closer<00:04:01.480> look<00:04:01.630> you<00:04:02.170> can<00:04:02.230> see<00:04:02.560> that

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830 
we take a closer look you can see that

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.460 
we take a closer look you can see that
all<00:04:03.400> the<00:04:03.790> little<00:04:04.030> patterns<00:04:04.480> are<00:04:04.840> made<00:04:05.200> up<00:04:05.320> of

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
all the little patterns are made up of

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.810 
all the little patterns are made up of
dots<00:04:06.420> so<00:04:07.420> you<00:04:07.930> can<00:04:08.110> see<00:04:08.500> that<00:04:08.769> it's<00:04:08.920> done<00:04:09.579> by

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
dots so you can see that it's done by

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.300 
dots so you can see that it's done by
hand<00:04:10.120> took<00:04:10.780> about<00:04:11.019> two<00:04:11.290> and<00:04:11.320> a<00:04:11.500> half<00:04:11.620> hours<00:04:12.010> to

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
hand took about two and a half hours to

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.340 
hand took about two and a half hours to
finish<00:04:12.340> this<00:04:12.820> pain<00:04:13.450> isn't<00:04:13.720> bad<00:04:14.110> at<00:04:14.320> all

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
finish this pain isn't bad at all

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.759 
finish this pain isn't bad at all
considering<00:04:15.190> it's<00:04:15.459> the<00:04:15.900> outside<00:04:16.900> of<00:04:17.079> my<00:04:17.290> upper

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
considering it's the outside of my upper

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.550 
considering it's the outside of my upper
arm<00:04:18.040> it's<00:04:18.549> enough<00:04:18.880> I<00:04:19.060> usually<00:04:19.780> never<00:04:19.959> bad<00:04:20.229> when

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
arm it's enough I usually never bad when

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.120 
arm it's enough I usually never bad when
it's<00:04:20.709> the<00:04:21.210> outside<00:04:22.210> of<00:04:22.300> the<00:04:22.390> arm<00:04:22.570> like<00:04:22.750> this

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
it's the outside of the arm like this

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.090 
it's the outside of the arm like this
but<00:04:24.130> I<00:04:24.160> think<00:04:24.520> it<00:04:24.610> hurts<00:04:24.760> even<00:04:25.120> less<00:04:25.360> when

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
but I think it hurts even less when

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:31.010 
but I think it hurts even less when
you<00:04:26.310> do<00:04:27.860> hand<00:04:28.860> poked<00:04:29.280> dot<00:04:29.730> work<00:04:30.000> so<00:04:30.450> I'm<00:04:30.630> super
