00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
find some buttons which I'll be

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.660 
find some buttons which I'll be
explaining<00:00:42.239> in<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.660> while<00:00:42.890> so<00:00:43.890> let's<00:00:44.309> plug<00:00:44.550> it

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
explaining in a while so let's plug it

00:00:44.670 --> 00:01:26.459 
explaining in a while so let's plug it
in<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.059> test<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.539> audio<00:00:45.809> quality

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:26.469 

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:28.929 

so<00:01:27.469> that<00:01:27.799> was<00:01:27.890> the<00:01:28.009> audio<00:01:28.310> and<00:01:28.549> it<00:01:28.850> was

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
so that was the audio and it was

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:31.300 
so that was the audio and it was
actually<00:01:29.299> quite<00:01:29.450> impressive<00:01:30.069> now<00:01:31.069> on<00:01:31.189> the

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
actually quite impressive now on the

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.699 
actually quite impressive now on the
buttons<00:01:31.700> we<00:01:32.420> can<00:01:32.600> see<00:01:32.780> the<00:01:32.959> brightness<00:01:33.200> which

00:01:33.699 --> 00:01:33.709 
buttons we can see the brightness which

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:35.260 
buttons we can see the brightness which
basically<00:01:34.130> lets<00:01:34.429> you<00:01:34.609> adjust<00:01:34.729> the<00:01:35.090> brightness

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
basically lets you adjust the brightness

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.709 
basically lets you adjust the brightness

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:38.719 
of the display we can also find the DST

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:41.289 
of the display we can also find the DST
which<00:01:39.289> allows<00:01:39.619> you<00:01:39.829> to<00:01:39.859> set<00:01:40.189> the<00:01:40.819> clock<00:01:41.090> to

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
which allows you to set the clock to

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:43.809 
which allows you to set the clock to
daylight<00:01:41.689> saving<00:01:42.109> time<00:01:42.140> and<00:01:42.649> we<00:01:43.429> have<00:01:43.670> the

00:01:43.809 --> 00:01:43.819 
daylight saving time and we have the

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:54.820 
daylight saving time and we have the
clock<00:01:44.060> button
