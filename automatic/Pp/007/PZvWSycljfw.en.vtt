Dino trim super cool new tremolo from

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.990 
Dino trim super cool new tremolo from
the<00:01:38.620> fine<00:01:38.800> folks<00:01:39.070> at<00:01:39.190> Keeley<00:01:39.550> they<00:01:39.700> make<00:01:39.820> lots

the fine folks at Keeley they make lots

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.250 
the fine folks at Keeley they make lots
of<00:01:40.180> great<00:01:40.360> pedals<00:01:40.690> and<00:01:40.810> so<00:01:40.900> I<00:01:40.930> was<00:01:41.110> really

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.260 
of great pedals and so I was really

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.830 
of great pedals and so I was really
excited<00:01:41.650> to<00:01:41.890> try<00:01:42.070> this<00:01:42.130> one<00:01:42.280> out<00:01:42.690> and<00:01:43.690> it

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
excited to try this one out and it

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.110 
excited to try this one out and it
sounds<00:01:44.140> so<00:01:44.320> cool<00:01:44.530> basically<00:01:45.190> it's<00:01:45.700> a<00:01:45.790> tremolo

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:46.120 
sounds so cool basically it's a tremolo

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.180 
sounds so cool basically it's a tremolo
with<00:01:46.270> a<00:01:46.330> few<00:01:46.510> different<00:01:46.780> modes<00:01:46.960> and<00:01:47.380> it's

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
with a few different modes and it's

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.340 
with a few different modes and it's
highly<00:01:48.490> controllable<00:01:49.120> by<00:01:49.390> the<00:01:49.450> way<00:01:49.840> you<00:01:49.900> play

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
highly controllable by the way you play

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.780 
highly controllable by the way you play
by<00:01:50.590> your<00:01:50.740> own<00:01:50.770> dynamics<00:01:51.430> and<00:01:51.550> your<00:01:51.640> pick

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
by your own dynamics and your pick

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.310 
by your own dynamics and your pick
attack<00:01:52.120> and<00:01:52.330> what<00:01:52.450> not<00:01:52.630> your<00:01:52.810> pick<00:01:52.990> attacks

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
attack and what not your pick attacks

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.140 
attack and what not your pick attacks
can<00:01:53.530> vary<00:01:53.770> the<00:01:53.979> rate<00:01:54.190> of<00:01:54.430> the<00:01:54.580> tremolo<00:01:54.820> and

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
can vary the rate of the tremolo and

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.990 
can vary the rate of the tremolo and
also<00:01:55.840> the<00:01:55.960> depth<00:01:56.200> of<00:01:56.380> the<00:01:56.470> tremolo<00:01:56.740> and<00:01:57.130> then

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
also the depth of the tremolo and then

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.640 
also the depth of the tremolo and then
there's<00:01:58.150> also<00:01:58.300> a<00:01:58.420> mode<00:01:59.200> that<00:01:59.410> actually

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
there's also a mode that actually

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.710 
there's also a mode that actually
features<00:01:59.950> harmonic<00:02:00.610> tremolo<00:02:01.060> for<00:02:01.270> that<00:02:01.390> super

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
features harmonic tremolo for that super

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.510 
features harmonic tremolo for that super
cool<00:02:02.050> like<00:02:02.259> sort<00:02:02.470> of<00:02:02.500> phase<00:02:02.740> Eve<00:02:02.979> IV<00:02:03.340> type

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
cool like sort of phase Eve IV type

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.359 
cool like sort of phase Eve IV type
effect<00:02:04.080> and<00:02:05.080> that<00:02:05.110> mode<00:02:05.740> also<00:02:05.950> features<00:02:06.100> a

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
effect and that mode also features a

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:08.430 
effect and that mode also features a
really<00:02:06.700> great<00:02:07.000> sounding<00:02:07.360> reverb<00:02:07.720> so<00:02:08.200> that<00:02:08.320> was

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
really great sounding reverb so that was

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.990 
really great sounding reverb so that was
on<00:02:08.560> the<00:02:08.649> first<00:02:08.830> guitar<00:02:09.070> part<00:02:09.459> on<00:02:09.640> the<00:02:09.790> song

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
on the first guitar part on the song

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.430 
on the first guitar part on the song
that<00:02:10.450> you<00:02:10.570> heard<00:02:10.690> at<00:02:10.840> the<00:02:10.899> beginning<00:02:11.020> of<00:02:11.350> the

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
that you heard at the beginning of the

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.979 
that you heard at the beginning of the
video<00:02:11.560> the<00:02:11.950> harmonic<00:02:12.940> Tremmel<00:02:13.270> mode<00:02:13.750> with<00:02:13.959> a

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
video the harmonic Tremmel mode with a

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:15.990 
video the harmonic Tremmel mode with a
healthy<00:02:14.380> dose<00:02:14.530> of<00:02:14.680> reverb<00:02:15.010> and<00:02:15.280> then<00:02:15.760> on<00:02:15.880> the

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
healthy dose of reverb and then on the

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.540 
healthy dose of reverb and then on the
second<00:02:16.360> guitar<00:02:17.050> part<00:02:17.290> that<00:02:17.500> came<00:02:17.709> in<00:02:17.980> you

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
second guitar part that came in you

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.390 
second guitar part that came in you
heard<00:02:18.700> me<00:02:18.820> use<00:02:19.030> the<00:02:19.390> variable<00:02:19.959> rate<00:02:20.400> tremolo

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
heard me use the variable rate tremolo

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.710 
heard me use the variable rate tremolo
mode<00:02:21.670> where<00:02:21.910> my<00:02:22.030> pick<00:02:22.239> attack<00:02:22.540> was

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
mode where my pick attack was

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.390 
mode where my pick attack was
controlling<00:02:23.080> the<00:02:23.230> rate<00:02:23.380> pick<00:02:23.770> harden<00:02:24.190> it<00:02:24.280> at

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
controlling the rate pick harden it at

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.490 
controlling the rate pick harden it at
speed<00:02:24.670> up<00:02:24.820> and<00:02:25.060> then<00:02:25.630> as<00:02:25.840> the<00:02:26.020> note<00:02:26.200> or<00:02:26.470> chord

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
speed up and then as the note or chord

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.350 
speed up and then as the note or chord
faded<00:02:27.100> out<00:02:27.190> you<00:02:27.370> hear<00:02:27.489> the<00:02:27.580> tremolo<00:02:27.790> slow<00:02:28.180> down

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
faded out you hear the tremolo slow down

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.449 
faded out you hear the tremolo slow down
so<00:02:28.750> it's<00:02:28.930> just<00:02:29.020> really<00:02:29.350> really<00:02:29.680> fun<00:02:29.980> and<00:02:30.250> you

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
so it's just really really fun and you

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:31.920 
so it's just really really fun and you
can<00:02:30.580> add<00:02:30.700> a<00:02:30.730> lot<00:02:30.910> of<00:02:31.060> sort<00:02:31.239> of<00:02:31.299> texture<00:02:31.720> and

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
can add a lot of sort of texture and

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.560 
can add a lot of sort of texture and
vibe<00:02:32.620> to<00:02:32.860> your<00:02:32.950> playing<00:02:33.190> using<00:02:33.489> a<00:02:33.970> tremolo

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
vibe to your playing using a tremolo

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.110 
vibe to your playing using a tremolo
like<00:02:34.810> this<00:02:35.019> so<00:02:35.620> let's<00:02:35.830> listen<00:02:36.040> to<00:02:36.370> once<00:02:37.060> again

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
like this so let's listen to once again

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.620 
like this so let's listen to once again
harmonic<00:02:37.840> tremolo<00:02:38.350> mode<00:02:38.610> so<00:02:39.610> load<00:02:39.820> outside<00:02:40.420> in

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
harmonic tremolo mode so load outside in

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.539 
harmonic tremolo mode so load outside in
the<00:02:40.690> mix<00:02:40.900> of<00:02:41.049> that<00:02:41.140> song<00:02:41.470> so<00:02:42.190> you<00:02:42.250> can<00:02:42.370> really

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
the mix of that song so you can really

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:44.370 
the mix of that song so you can really
hear<00:02:42.790> what<00:02:43.510> it's<00:02:43.630> doing<00:02:43.870> without<00:02:44.080> any<00:02:44.260> other

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
hear what it's doing without any other

00:02:44.380 --> 00:03:23.280 
hear what it's doing without any other
stuff<00:02:44.650> going<00:02:44.830> on<00:02:44.950> here<00:02:45.130> we<00:02:45.310> go

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.449 

okay<00:03:24.290> so<00:03:24.349> once<00:03:24.530> again<00:03:24.620> that<00:03:24.860> was<00:03:24.950> harmonic

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
okay so once again that was harmonic

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.820 
okay so once again that was harmonic
tremolo<00:03:26.000> mode<00:03:26.300> and<00:03:26.660> in<00:03:27.019> harmonic<00:03:27.470> tremolo

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
tremolo mode and in harmonic tremolo

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:29.080 
tremolo mode and in harmonic tremolo
mode<00:03:28.010> you<00:03:28.129> also<00:03:28.220> get<00:03:28.430> that<00:03:28.519> great<00:03:28.730> sounding

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
mode you also get that great sounding

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.030 
mode you also get that great sounding
reverb<00:03:29.540> and<00:03:29.810> the<00:03:30.110> reverb<00:03:30.379> is<00:03:30.500> controlled<00:03:30.890> by

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
reverb and the reverb is controlled by

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.250 
reverb and the reverb is controlled by
this<00:03:31.099> shape<00:03:31.489> knob<00:03:31.790> right<00:03:32.269> here<00:03:32.330> now<00:03:33.019> when<00:03:33.170> you

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
this shape knob right here now when you

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.110 
this shape knob right here now when you
flip<00:03:33.470> from<00:03:33.620> harmonic<00:03:34.099> tremolo<00:03:34.489> mode<00:03:34.700> over<00:03:34.970> to

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
flip from harmonic tremolo mode over to

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.000 
flip from harmonic tremolo mode over to
either<00:03:35.360> variable<00:03:35.780> rate<00:03:36.170> motor<00:03:36.440> variable

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
either variable rate motor variable

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.800 
either variable rate motor variable
depth<00:03:37.250> mode<00:03:37.580> which<00:03:38.030> is<00:03:38.180> these<00:03:38.510> two<00:03:38.660> other

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
depth mode which is these two other

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.300 
depth mode which is these two other
positions<00:03:39.260> on<00:03:39.380> this<00:03:39.500> little<00:03:39.650> mini<00:03:39.890> toggle

let's<00:03:53.720> check<00:03:53.900> out<00:03:53.989> now<00:03:54.170> the<00:03:54.230> second<00:03:55.069> guitar

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
let's check out now the second guitar

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.770 
let's check out now the second guitar
part<00:03:55.580> in<00:03:55.700> that<00:03:55.819> song<00:03:56.030> from<00:03:56.209> the<00:03:56.330> beginning<00:03:56.599> of

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
part in that song from the beginning of

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.319 
part in that song from the beginning of
the<00:03:56.840> video<00:03:57.190> in<00:03:58.190> that<00:03:58.370> I<00:03:58.430> use<00:03:58.640> variable<00:03:59.120> rate

00:03:59.319 --> 00:03:59.329 
the video in that I use variable rate

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:01.780 
the video in that I use variable rate
mode<00:03:59.569> so<00:03:59.930> once<00:04:00.079> again<00:04:00.200> when<00:04:00.410> I<00:04:00.440> pick<00:04:00.739> hard<00:04:00.980> the

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
mode so once again when I pick hard the

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.610 
mode so once again when I pick hard the
rate<00:04:02.000> increases<00:04:02.510> and<00:04:02.900> gets<00:04:03.049> real<00:04:03.230> stuttery

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
rate increases and gets real stuttery

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.620 
rate increases and gets real stuttery
and<00:04:03.920> as<00:04:04.069> the<00:04:04.370> quarter<00:04:04.670> note<00:04:04.849> fades<00:04:05.239> or<00:04:05.450> if<00:04:05.540> I

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
and as the quarter note fades or if I

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.690 
and as the quarter note fades or if I
pick<00:04:05.870> softer<00:04:06.349> the<00:04:06.500> tremolo<00:04:06.709> slows<00:04:07.130> down<00:04:07.400> so

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
pick softer the tremolo slows down so

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.250 
pick softer the tremolo slows down so
that's<00:04:07.760> just<00:04:07.910> a<00:04:08.030> really<00:04:08.599> really<00:04:08.720> cool<00:04:08.989> sound

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
that's just a really really cool sound

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.750 
that's just a really really cool sound
let's<00:04:09.709> listen<00:04:09.980> to<00:04:10.040> that<00:04:10.069> once<00:04:10.370> again<00:04:10.610> now<00:04:10.730> I

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
let's listen to that once again now I

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.580 
let's listen to that once again now I
should<00:04:11.060> mention<00:04:11.269> I<00:04:11.450> added<00:04:11.780> a<00:04:11.959> little<00:04:12.290> bit<00:04:12.440> of

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
should mention I added a little bit of

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.789 
should mention I added a little bit of
slap<00:04:12.920> echo<00:04:13.130> to<00:04:13.340> this<00:04:13.579> sound<00:04:13.880> just<00:04:14.090> for<00:04:14.799> you

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
know just a vibe it up a little bit even

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.650 
know just a vibe it up a little bit even
more<00:04:18.410> and<00:04:18.799> I<00:04:18.889> used<00:04:19.070> a<00:04:19.160> diamond<00:04:19.400> delay<00:04:20.329> for<00:04:20.540> that

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
more and I used a diamond delay for that

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:48.100 
more and I used a diamond delay for that
okay<00:04:21.019> here<00:04:21.139> we<00:04:21.200> go

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.750 

let's<00:04:49.110> check<00:04:49.230> out<00:04:49.380> variable<00:04:49.920> depth<00:04:50.190> mode<00:04:50.490> now

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
let's check out variable depth mode now

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.060 
let's check out variable depth mode now
on<00:04:51.090> the<00:04:51.330> Keely<00:04:51.840> Dinah<00:04:52.050> trim<00:04:52.380> so<00:04:52.560> in<00:04:52.650> this<00:04:52.830> mode

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
on the Keely Dinah trim so in this mode

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.370 
on the Keely Dinah trim so in this mode
when<00:04:53.640> I<00:04:53.670> pick<00:04:53.940> hard<00:04:54.210> the<00:04:54.750> depth<00:04:55.020> is<00:04:55.170> going<00:04:55.290> to

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
when I pick hard the depth is going to

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.560 
when I pick hard the depth is going to
get<00:04:55.500> real<00:04:55.740> pronounced<00:04:56.280> and<00:04:56.430> deep<00:04:56.610> and<00:04:56.850> then

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
get real pronounced and deep and then

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.180 
get real pronounced and deep and then
it's<00:04:57.720> the<00:04:57.810> chord<00:04:58.080> fades<00:04:58.380> and<00:04:58.560> the<00:04:58.650> note<00:04:58.830> fades

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
it's the chord fades and the note fades

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.430 
it's the chord fades and the note fades
or<00:04:59.580> as<00:04:59.880> I<00:05:00.000> pick<00:05:00.210> lighter<00:05:00.480> the<00:05:00.930> depth<00:05:01.170> is<00:05:01.350> going

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
or as I pick lighter the depth is going

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:31.909 
or as I pick lighter the depth is going
to<00:05:01.560> be<00:05:01.740> less<00:05:02.130> pronounced

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:34.230
