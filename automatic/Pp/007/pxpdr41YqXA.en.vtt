 Hello friends, I'm Raúl Treviño, writer and comic artist. On this occasion 

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:12.500
 I will give tips to be able to draw explosions in our comics with ink and latex. 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.520
 In this channel I show my work processes and give advice of interest for applicants 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.519
 to draw comics. 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:25.359
 The materials he used were a 3H pencil. 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.720
 A cut or quilted pen so that it does not hurt our fingers in case 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.780
 to use it for a long time. A pen to define details. 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:44.990
 Japanese Sumi ink of the brand KAIMEI for manga. And pivot latex with its rubber for 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.239
 Remove it once it dries. Some of these materials can be found in my store, 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.030
 below I leave the link. 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.309
 With the help of the ruler and the vanishing point, I draw the strokes with the latex to cover 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:06.250
 the areas that I do not want to affect with black ink. I find it very fun to use the mask 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.159
 of latex, because personally, using white ink to make these effects, is not 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:17.570
 I like you I like to preserve the color of paper and the accidental effects that can be 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.250
 achieve using this technique. 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:27.350
 To draw explosions is very simple and fun. It's about splicing spheres some 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:34.350
 with others and visualize them from back to front. Whether marking or imagining a starting point, 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:41.119
 that is, causing the action to start from a central point outwards. 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:47.590
 With the ink I begin to shape the spheres, but without completing them, we will only ink 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.950
 the top part of the sphere, since the bottom part, is where the light or the 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.729
 fire. 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:01.710
 We load the brush with ink and draw, but let's play a little with the texture of the brush. 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:08.030
 Well, it will help us to diffuse the smoke from the explosion. I love this effect, because 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:14.069
 when the brush runs out of ink, it gives us very nice accidental textures. 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:20.110
 At the same time, we should consider drawing flashes or pointed bursts to suggest 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:26.560
 internal explosions that we can not see between the explosion and the fire. This will give you more 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.220
 life to the explosion. And pieces of stones and speed lines will give you an effect 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.460
 more dynamic and realistic. 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.800
 Here we can see how the explosion was, if you observe, the action comes from the center 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:47.050
 of the page. The vanishing point starts right in the face of the character. 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:52.129
 This drawing of the Ultrapato will be published in the artbook of La Mole, one of the conventions 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:57.209
 of the largest and most important comics in Mexico, and some of the characters that inspired and marked 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:02.849
 the youth of many over there in the 90's. This artbook will also contain drawings 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:09.340
 of other very talented and high quality professional artists. So I wait for you from 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:16.110
 March 13 to 15, 2015 at the World Trade Center in Mexico City. Buying 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:22.280
 this artbook will be helping the association Proayuda de niños con cáncer. If they acquire it 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:28.840
 I will sign them and we can talk for a while. Edgar Delgado will also be at the event, 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:35.170
 creator of Ultrapato and colorist of the Spiderman comic. And the best, they can acquire 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.860
 the Ultrapato comic published by Fixión Narrators. For those who do not live in Mexico, 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.209
 I leave the link below to ask for it online. 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:50.950
 On the other hand, I wanted to draw a passive scene for the character, but energetic in its environment. 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:56.280
 At the same time, with the coat broken, I suggest that Ultrapto is having a battle, not 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:03.189
 we know with whom or what kind of threat, but because this gives some mystery to the 

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:08.459
 The layer was another of my favorite parts of inking, since I also applied latex 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:15.329
 to cover certain areas. As you can see, I'm removing the latex and it starts to look 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:22.010
 the effect caused by the explosion. And smart, they are like flashes of light that pass through 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.760
 of the layer. 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:30.230
 Never forget to add pieces of stone in the air, as this will always give a feeling 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.230
 of movement. 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:37.880
 At the time of inking the hair, we must do it with safe strokes, without fear, for 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:43.470
 that if we do them with insecurity, they will come out crooked and with little naturalness. 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:49.510
 In this drawing I wanted to concentrate on the graphic. And I chose to give importance to the silhouettes 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:55.040
 to obtain a clear scene with visual force. This work in the graph is 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:01.000
 As important as the values ​​in color, you must clearly define the forms for 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.820
 that our scenes have a lot of strength, no matter how little or how much detail we put 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:12.600
 in them. Well, if we have a clear graphic, we will impact the viewer more. 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:21.300
 And since it's a full-color artbook, I gave it color digitally and here I show you the final piece. 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:27.660
