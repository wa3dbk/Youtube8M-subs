you can see the double push here that

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.410 
you can see the double push here that
we're<00:00:55.829> starting<00:00:56.219> with<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.670> then<00:00:57.270> we're

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
we're starting with and then we're

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
combination you can see from the

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.399 
combination you can see from the
traditional<00:01:06.090> routine<00:01:06.479> so<00:01:06.689> everything's

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
traditional routine so everything's

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.920 
traditional routine so everything's
modified<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:08.220> apply<00:01:09.119> on<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.420> Thai<00:01:09.659> pads

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
and the belly pad so we're going more

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.039 
and the belly pad so we're going more
into<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.750> atonement<00:01:13.140> conditioning<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.189> the

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049

into the atonement conditioning and the
impact<00:01:16.049> training<00:01:16.590> so<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.250> can<00:01:17.430> see<00:01:17.670> we're<00:01:17.850> at

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
impact training so you can see we're at

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.179 
impact training so you can see we're at
the<00:01:18.000> second<00:01:18.390> phase<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.500> training<00:01:19.710> here<00:01:20.070> -

to direct yourself to

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.399 
to direct yourself to
so<00:01:31.640> I've<00:01:32.060> got<00:01:32.270> Cameron<00:01:32.720> here<00:01:32.900> on<00:01:32.990> a<00:01:33.020> drilling

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
so I've got Cameron here on a drilling

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:36.340 
so I've got Cameron here on a drilling
exercise<00:01:34.159> which<00:01:34.939> is<00:01:34.970> teaching<00:01:35.509> instability

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
exercise which is teaching instability

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.960 
exercise which is teaching instability
and<00:01:36.939> two<00:01:37.939> hand<00:01:38.240> timing<00:01:38.960> blocking<00:01:39.970> leading

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
and two hand timing blocking leading

into the last punch before the foot hits

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.969 
into the last punch before the foot hits
the<00:01:43.340> ground<00:01:43.570> so<00:01:44.570> it's<00:01:44.720> all<00:01:44.930> about<00:01:45.200> timing<00:01:45.680> and

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
the ground so it's all about timing and

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.240 
the ground so it's all about timing and
training<00:01:46.610> and<00:01:46.759> conditioning<00:01:47.409> to<00:01:48.409> teach

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
training and conditioning to teach

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.399 
training and conditioning to teach
yourself<00:01:49.700> the<00:01:50.270> position<00:01:50.750> your<00:01:50.899> body<00:01:51.049> needs<00:01:51.320> to

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
yourself the position your body needs to

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:53.999 
yourself the position your body needs to
be<00:01:51.500> in<00:01:51.740> when<00:01:52.520> you're<00:01:52.670> applying<00:01:53.060> the<00:01:53.360> technique

be in when you're applying the technique

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.219 
be in when you're applying the technique
so<00:01:55.009> keep<00:01:55.909> in<00:01:56.090> mind<00:01:56.119> we're<00:01:56.539> doing<00:01:56.750> bits<00:01:57.049> and

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
so keep in mind we're doing bits and

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.710 
so keep in mind we're doing bits and
pieces<00:01:57.470> of<00:01:57.710> that<00:01:57.890> routine<00:01:58.399> and<00:01:58.700> we're<00:01:59.360> taking

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
pieces of that routine and we're taking

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.990 
pieces of that routine and we're taking
it<00:01:59.840> through<00:02:00.080> step<00:02:01.070> at<00:02:01.220> a<00:02:01.310> time

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
it through step at a time

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.450 
it through step at a time
drilling<00:02:02.390> each<00:02:02.659> routine<00:02:03.170> taking<00:02:04.130> it<00:02:04.250> to<00:02:04.369> his

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
drilling each routine taking it to his

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.109 
drilling each routine taking it to his
next<00:02:04.789> one

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
next one

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.210

joining<00:02:05.390> them<00:02:05.600> all<00:02:05.750> together<00:02:05.960> and<00:02:06.770> then

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
joining them all together and then

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.830 
joining them all together and then
putting<00:02:07.580> them<00:02:07.700> all<00:02:07.880> together<00:02:08.060> at<00:02:08.390> the<00:02:08.420> end<00:02:08.509> as

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
putting them all together at the end as

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.570 
putting them all together at the end as
you'll<00:02:09.019> see<00:02:11.470> so<00:02:12.470> here<00:02:12.650> you<00:02:12.769> can<00:02:12.920> see<00:02:13.130> Cameron

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.080 
you'll see so here you can see Cameron
with<00:02:13.730> the<00:02:13.910> hooks<00:02:14.510> now<00:02:15.430> instead<00:02:16.430> of<00:02:16.549> the<00:02:16.700> elbows

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
with the hooks now instead of the elbows

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.750 
with the hooks now instead of the elbows
so<00:02:17.480> we're<00:02:17.630> just<00:02:17.660> giving<00:02:18.200> him<00:02:18.440> variations<00:02:19.280> and

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
so we're just giving him variations and

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.180 
so we're just giving him variations and
giving<00:02:20.690> him<00:02:20.810> a<00:02:20.900> little<00:02:21.080> bit<00:02:21.170> better<00:02:21.650> option

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
giving him a little bit better option

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.120 
giving him a little bit better option
whether<00:02:22.489> it's<00:02:22.700> a<00:02:22.819> book<00:02:23.030> or<00:02:23.209> a<00:02:23.630> nail<00:02:24.140> box<00:02:24.410> so<00:02:25.010> we

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
whether it's a book or a nail box so we

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.979 
whether it's a book or a nail box so we
want<00:02:25.310> to<00:02:25.400> Train<00:02:25.610> both<00:02:25.880> for<00:02:26.180> short<00:02:26.450> range<00:02:26.660> and

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
want to Train both for short range and

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:30.789 
want to Train both for short range and
long<00:02:27.290> range<00:02:28.600> make<00:02:29.600> sure<00:02:29.840> we<00:02:29.989> combine<00:02:30.620> those

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:30.799 
long range make sure we combine those

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:34.330 
long range make sure we combine those
two<00:02:31.069> techniques<00:02:31.930> so<00:02:32.930> you'll<00:02:33.500> see<00:02:33.830> us<00:02:33.860> go

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
through the next technique here is the

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.430 
through the next technique here is the
last<00:02:36.920> phase<00:02:37.310> of<00:02:37.690> five<00:02:38.690> animals<00:02:39.079> where<00:02:39.320> we

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
last phase of five animals where we

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.760 
last phase of five animals where we
enter<00:02:39.799> and<00:02:40.239> roll<00:02:41.239> the<00:02:41.390> two<00:02:41.570> punches<00:02:41.989> over

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
watch the whole combination as Cameron

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:59.710 
watch the whole combination as Cameron
does<00:02:53.000> it<00:02:53.180> now<00:02:53.500> push<00:02:54.500> across<00:02:58.360> so<00:02:59.360> it's<00:02:59.540> the

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
does it now push across so it's the

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.210 
does it now push across so it's the
whole<00:03:00.530> routine<00:03:01.130> of<00:03:01.340> the<00:03:01.490> five<00:03:02.360> animals<00:03:02.720> on<00:03:02.840> the

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
routine again you can see it would be

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.660 
routine again you can see it would be
applied<00:03:08.990> completely<00:03:09.530> different<00:03:10.010> it's

this<00:04:37.530> technique<00:04:37.860> comes<00:04:38.070> from<00:04:38.250> the<00:04:38.340> uppercut

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
this technique comes from the uppercut

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.529 
this technique comes from the uppercut
smashes<00:04:39.389> down<00:04:39.889> presses<00:04:40.889> out<00:04:41.130> it<00:04:42.000> comes<00:04:42.180> down

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:42.539 
smashes down presses out it comes down

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:46.129 
smashes down presses out it comes down
and<00:04:42.960> then<00:04:43.949> forces<00:04:44.460> out<00:04:44.639> so<00:04:45.539> here<00:04:45.780> you'll<00:04:45.960> see

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:46.139 
and then forces out so here you'll see

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:50.270 
and then forces out so here you'll see
Cameron<00:04:46.650> applying<00:04:47.039> it<00:04:47.600> back<00:04:48.600> push<00:04:48.930> hammer<00:04:49.500> so

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
Cameron applying it back push hammer so

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.060 
Cameron applying it back push hammer so
we're<00:04:50.430> looking<00:04:50.639> at<00:04:50.789> some<00:04:50.970> inside<00:04:52.070> application

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
we're looking at some inside application

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.340 
we're looking at some inside application
we're<00:04:53.340> getting<00:04:53.550> Cameron<00:04:54.000> to<00:04:54.180> memorize<00:04:55.020> and

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 
we're getting Cameron to memorize and

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:58.070 
we're getting Cameron to memorize and
drill<00:04:55.620> the<00:04:55.740> moves<00:04:55.979> and<00:04:56.449> then<00:04:57.449> as<00:04:57.660> we<00:04:57.840> apply

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
drill the moves and then as we apply

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.529 
drill the moves and then as we apply
more<00:04:58.410> video<00:04:58.680> footage<00:04:59.160> you'll<00:04:59.550> see<00:04:59.820> it<00:04:59.970> more<00:05:00.210> in

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:00.539 
more video footage you'll see it more in

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:03.560 
more video footage you'll see it more in
a<00:05:00.870> greater<00:05:01.260> application<00:05:02.210> so<00:05:03.210> here<00:05:03.449> you<00:05:03.539> see

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.570 
a greater application so here you see

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.629 
a greater application so here you see
myself<00:05:03.960> doing<00:05:04.440> the<00:05:04.650> moves<00:05:04.860> but<00:05:05.220> I'm<00:05:05.340> more

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:05.639 
myself doing the moves but I'm more

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:07.520 
myself doing the moves but I'm more
applying<00:05:06.030> the<00:05:06.210> hook<00:05:06.419> fist<00:05:06.750> rather<00:05:07.229> than<00:05:07.470> a

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
applying the hook fist rather than a

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.920 
applying the hook fist rather than a
hammer<00:05:07.770> fist<00:05:08.240> so<00:05:09.240> we're<00:05:09.419> changing<00:05:09.660> the

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
hammer fist so we're changing the

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.629 
hammer fist so we're changing the
dynamics<00:05:10.470> we're<00:05:10.830> changing<00:05:11.280> a<00:05:11.370> little<00:05:11.490> bit

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:11.639 
dynamics we're changing a little bit

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:15.110 
dynamics we're changing a little bit
moving<00:05:11.970> around<00:05:12.389> and<00:05:12.780> so<00:05:13.280> let's<00:05:14.280> go<00:05:14.430> back<00:05:14.460> to<00:05:14.639> WI

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
moving around and so let's go back to WI

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.670 
moving around and so let's go back to WI
let's<00:05:15.510> watch<00:05:15.690> the<00:05:15.840> boys<00:05:16.020> do<00:05:16.349> the<00:05:16.470> whole

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
let's watch the boys do the whole

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:22.089 
let's watch the boys do the whole
routine<00:05:17.630> in<00:05:18.630> his<00:05:18.780> traditional<00:05:19.320> sense

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:22.099 

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:29.170 

footwork<00:05:24.440> allows<00:05:25.440> them<00:05:25.710> to<00:05:25.860> move<00:05:26.010> forward

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.790 

memorize<00:05:30.180> the<00:05:30.360> moves<00:05:30.599> then<00:05:31.380> you'll<00:05:31.530> be<00:05:31.710> able

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
memorize the moves then you'll be able

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.029 
memorize the moves then you'll be able
to<00:05:31.949> practice<00:05:32.190> it<00:05:32.520> non-stop<00:05:33.860> repetition<00:05:34.860> wise

00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:35.039 
to practice it non-stop repetition wise

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:38.659 
to practice it non-stop repetition wise
as<00:05:35.400> you<00:05:35.639> see<00:05:35.849> is<00:05:35.970> doing<00:05:36.150> on<00:05:36.360> the<00:05:36.389> hand<00:05:36.659> pads<00:05:37.669> so

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:38.669 
as you see is doing on the hand pads so

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:40.339 
as you see is doing on the hand pads so
Charlie<00:05:39.150> fights<00:05:39.389> a<00:05:39.479> lot<00:05:39.630> of<00:05:39.780> repetitious

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:40.349 
Charlie fights a lot of repetitious

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:44.240 
Charlie fights a lot of repetitious
movements<00:05:41.750> memorizing<00:05:42.750> so<00:05:43.680> you<00:05:43.860> can<00:05:44.099> then

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
movements memorizing so you can then

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:50.120 
movements memorizing so you can then
apply<00:05:44.370> with<00:05:44.940> flurry<00:05:45.360> and<00:05:45.960> combination<00:05:49.130> okay

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:50.130 
apply with flurry and combination okay

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:51.620 
apply with flurry and combination okay
so<00:05:50.280> here<00:05:50.610> we<00:05:50.639> have<00:05:50.820> the<00:05:50.940> guys<00:05:51.150> individually

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:51.630 
so here we have the guys individually

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:56.149 
so here we have the guys individually
chasing<00:05:52.470> the<00:05:52.590> technique<00:05:52.979> down<00:05:55.159> practicing

00:05:56.149 --> 00:05:56.159 
chasing the technique down practicing

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:58.279 
chasing the technique down practicing
their<00:05:56.310> footwork<00:05:56.639> and<00:05:56.880> moving<00:05:57.330> straight<00:05:58.080> line

00:05:58.279 --> 00:05:58.289
