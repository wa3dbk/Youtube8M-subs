give my children breast milk and I know
that<00:01:50.189> for<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.399> lot<00:01:50.610> of<00:01:50.820> moms<00:01:51.000> out<00:01:51.180> there<00:01:51.240> working

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
that for a lot of moms out there working

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.420 
that for a lot of moms out there working
or<00:01:51.810> not<00:01:51.960> there<00:01:52.140> are<00:01:52.290> many<00:01:52.320> many<00:01:52.860> challenges

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
or not there are many many challenges

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.980 
or not there are many many challenges
but<00:01:53.790> I<00:01:53.850> think<00:01:53.909> here's<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.420> important<00:01:54.840> point

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
but I think here's the important point

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.230 
but I think here's the important point
mom<00:01:55.470> shouldn't<00:01:55.890> feel<00:01:56.040> guilty<00:01:56.070> about<00:01:56.460> not
