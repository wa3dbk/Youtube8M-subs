00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:16.320
 I live online make me one 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.970
 true 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.010
 they demand I am super happy because in 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.310
 this time they will show you how to see a 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:30.800
 beautiful beautiful hairstyle and it's super easy 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.440
 and fast you will not take more than five 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.890
 minutes doing it and it's great because I 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.739
 I hate to take long in the hair I do not 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.360
 love at first seems as if 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.920
 they would have been very enthusiastic about 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.219
 hairstyle 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:49.329
 but it's not easy then if you want 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:49.329
 learn how to do it 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:55.909
 The first thing I did was comb my hair 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.129
 hair so he did not have anything of 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:02.019
 knots so I recommend you do it 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.019
 because this will be your x mo easier 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:07.750
 now this hair in half 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.950
 on one side meals make a mini braid 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:15.140
 French until the middle of the head and 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.619
 then you end up with a normal braid of 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:24.110
 3 kv and options with a gummie alone 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:27.220
 he does not love mayte to do exactly what 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.220
 same to the other side 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.700
 I like to always comb a little 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.410
 the braids because they look with more 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.410
 volume and more gorditas 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.990
 now you put back all the hair 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.880
 and one of the two braids you hold 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.259
 with a rubber band and you remove both 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.259
 previous rubbers 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.350
 having all the hair in the part of 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.929
 back they will make a braid of three 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.760
 ends and the base cast aside 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.099
 You can also change this braid 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.810
 three ends for a tang braid the 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.459
 point is that you will own these 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.170
 Styles if you have any hair left 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.200
 disheveled you can put it in its place 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.810
 with some hooks I'm a 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.060
 little in the front and is ready 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.040
 super easy you can also add 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.140
 some accessories I for example you 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.120
 I added some flowers but you 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:37.670
 you can add whatever you want you can 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.670
 be a little bow a little bow I do not know 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:53.300

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:53.300

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.430
