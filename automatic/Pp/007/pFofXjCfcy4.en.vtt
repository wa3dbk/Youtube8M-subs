time<00:05:52.770> I<00:05:53.190> was<00:05:53.550> expecting<00:05:53.820> it<00:05:54.060> to<00:05:54.150> be<00:05:54.180> a<00:05:54.270> much

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:54.479 
time I was expecting it to be a much

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:57.529 
time I was expecting it to be a much
closer<00:05:54.900> race<00:05:55.219> but<00:05:56.219> ogbonna<00:05:56.580> losses<00:05:57.300> and<00:05:57.479> the

00:05:57.529 --> 00:05:57.539 
closer race but ogbonna losses and the

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:01.040 
closer race but ogbonna losses and the
nati<00:05:58.169> of<00:05:58.409> wins<00:05:58.650> it's<00:05:58.919> 2-nil<00:05:59.370> to<00:05:59.550> tots<00:05:59.819> I<00:06:00.150> also

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.050 
nati of wins it's 2-nil to tots I also

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:02.570 
nati of wins it's 2-nil to tots I also
had<00:06:01.380> a<00:06:01.409> bit<00:06:01.620> of<00:06:01.650> struggle<00:06:01.979> to<00:06:02.219> choose<00:06:02.430> between

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 
had a bit of struggle to choose between

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.580 
had a bit of struggle to choose between
this<00:06:02.940> category<00:06:03.479> but<00:06:03.990> i<00:06:04.020> think<00:06:04.229> the<00:06:04.349> volley

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:04.590 
this category but i think the volley

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:07.219 
this category but i think the volley
settled<00:06:05.099> it<00:06:05.190> in<00:06:05.280> the<00:06:05.400> end<00:06:05.550> so<00:06:05.880> three<00:06:06.300> nil<00:06:06.509> to

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:07.229 
settled it in the end so three nil to

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:09.230 
settled it in the end so three nil to
team<00:06:07.440> of<00:06:07.650> the<00:06:07.800> season<00:06:08.250> because<00:06:08.639> 9<00:06:08.819> Colin's

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 
team of the season because 9 Colin's

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.899 
team of the season because 9 Colin's
actually<00:06:09.659> really<00:06:10.080> good<00:06:10.259> in<00:06:10.469> a<00:06:10.620> CDM<00:06:11.009> spot<00:06:11.340> but

00:06:11.899 --> 00:06:11.909 
actually really good in a CDM spot but

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:14.180 
actually really good in a CDM spot but
Pogba<00:06:12.360> his<00:06:12.930> stats<00:06:13.199> just<00:06:13.500> don't<00:06:13.710> lie<00:06:13.889> they're

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:14.190 
Pogba his stats just don't lie they're

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:16.459 
Pogba his stats just don't lie they're
ridiculously<00:06:14.849> good<00:06:15.150> and<00:06:15.360> now<00:06:16.050> coming<00:06:16.259> up<00:06:16.409> to

00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:16.469 
ridiculously good and now coming up to

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:20.450 
ridiculously good and now coming up to
the<00:06:16.729> composition<00:06:17.729> Vidal<00:06:18.719> was<00:06:18.750> good<00:06:19.460> but

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:20.460 
the composition Vidal was good but

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.999 
the composition Vidal was good but
unfortunately<00:06:21.180> Maria<00:06:21.750> was<00:06:22.020> just<00:06:22.289> better<00:06:22.530> you

00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:23.009 
unfortunately Maria was just better you

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:24.680 
unfortunately Maria was just better you
know<00:06:23.159> having<00:06:23.550> the<00:06:23.669> skill<00:06:23.969> moves<00:06:24.210> in<00:06:24.360> the<00:06:24.449> pace

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:24.690 
know having the skill moves in the pace

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.390 
know having the skill moves in the pace
and<00:06:24.930> stuff<00:06:25.139> like<00:06:25.289> that<00:06:25.349> acting<00:06:25.889> kind<00:06:26.130> of<00:06:26.219> like

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 
and stuff like that acting kind of like

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.459 
and stuff like that acting kind of like
a<00:06:26.430> winger<00:06:26.789> out<00:06:26.940> on<00:06:27.120> that<00:06:27.270> wide<00:06:27.479> cam<00:06:27.780> position<00:06:28.289> I

00:06:28.459 --> 00:06:28.469 
a winger out on that wide cam position I

00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:31.219 
a winger out on that wide cam position I
just<00:06:29.219> meant<00:06:29.460> that<00:06:29.580> he<00:06:30.300> was<00:06:30.419> better<00:06:30.659> so<00:06:31.080> that's

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:31.229 
just meant that he was better so that's

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:34.610 
just meant that he was better so that's
31<00:06:31.639> now<00:06:32.639> who<00:06:32.819> can<00:06:33.000> it<00:06:33.120> come<00:06:33.300> down<00:06:33.569> to<00:06:33.599> here<00:06:34.169> this

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:34.620 
31 now who can it come down to here this

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.149 
31 now who can it come down to here this
is<00:06:34.800> kind<00:06:35.099> of<00:06:35.190> an<00:06:35.310> important<00:06:35.729> one<00:06:35.880> strike<00:06:36.630> is

00:06:37.149 --> 00:06:37.159 
is kind of an important one strike is

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:39.890 
is kind of an important one strike is
it's<00:06:38.159> so<00:06:38.430> difficult<00:06:38.669> it<00:06:39.120> really<00:06:39.449> is<00:06:39.659> so

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:39.900 
it's so difficult it really is so

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:40.380 
it's so difficult it really is so
difficult

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:40.390 
difficult

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:41.850 
difficult
think<00:06:40.660> I'm<00:06:40.810> going<00:06:40.960> to<00:06:41.020> have<00:06:41.140> to<00:06:41.200> give<00:06:41.470> a<00:06:41.500> point

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:41.860 
think I'm going to have to give a point

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.670 
think I'm going to have to give a point
to<00:06:42.010> each<00:06:42.190> side<00:06:42.610> and<00:06:42.940> call<00:06:43.180> it<00:06:43.330> a<00:06:43.390> draw<00:06:43.720> because

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:44.680 
to each side and call it a draw because

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.130 
to each side and call it a draw because
they're<00:06:45.670> both<00:06:45.910> phenomenal<00:06:46.660> players<00:06:46.930> they're

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:47.140 
they're both phenomenal players they're

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:49.530 
they're both phenomenal players they're
so<00:06:47.320> different<00:06:47.620> it's<00:06:48.040> difficult<00:06:48.520> to<00:06:48.820> to<00:06:49.360> sort

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:49.540 
so different it's difficult to to sort

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.600 
so different it's difficult to to sort
of<00:06:49.630> compare<00:06:50.080> them<00:06:50.290> and<00:06:50.410> so<00:06:51.280> we're<00:06:51.430> going<00:06:51.520> to

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:51.610 
of compare them and so we're going to

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:53.280 
of compare them and so we're going to
give<00:06:51.730> a<00:06:51.760> point<00:06:52.060> to<00:06:52.150> each<00:06:52.300> one<00:06:52.600> and<00:06:52.900> that<00:06:53.080> makes

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:53.290 
give a point to each one and that makes

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:56.820 
give a point to each one and that makes
it<00:06:53.500> 4-2<00:06:54.120> to<00:06:55.120> team<00:06:55.390> of<00:06:55.570> the<00:06:55.720> season<00:06:56.200> which<00:06:56.440> means

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:56.830 
it 4-2 to team of the season which means

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.790 
it 4-2 to team of the season which means
that<00:06:57.250> the<00:06:58.000> gods<00:06:58.270> are<00:06:58.570> with<00:06:58.600> us<00:06:58.870> today<00:06:59.050> and<00:06:59.650> it

00:06:59.790 --> 00:06:59.800 
that the gods are with us today and it

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.560 
that the gods are with us today and it
does<00:07:00.010> prove<00:07:00.340> that<00:07:00.580> some<00:07:00.790> of<00:07:00.910> these<00:07:01.000> TV<00:07:01.300> this
