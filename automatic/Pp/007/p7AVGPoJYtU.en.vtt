00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
I saw a TED talk dr. Boaz all mug he

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.840 
I saw a TED talk dr. Boaz all mug he
demonstrated<00:01:00.840> this<00:01:00.960> technology<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:02.670> blew

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
demonstrated this technology and it blew

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.640 
demonstrated this technology and it blew
my<00:01:02.970> mind<00:01:03.000> it<00:01:03.300> looked<00:01:03.450> like<00:01:03.540> magic<00:01:03.960> he<00:01:04.199> actually

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
my mind it looked like magic he actually

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.040 
my mind it looked like magic he actually
sells<00:01:04.980> these<00:01:05.220> mostly<00:01:06.060> for<00:01:06.390> scientific

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.050 
sells these mostly for scientific

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.810 
sells these mostly for scientific
demonstration<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:07.830> thought<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.610> this<00:01:08.670> would

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
demonstration I thought that this would

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.000 
demonstration I thought that this would
be<00:01:08.880> an<00:01:09.180> amazing<00:01:09.360> presentation<00:01:10.110> in<00:01:10.560> the

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
be an amazing presentation in the

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.320 
be an amazing presentation in the
restaurant<00:01:11.400> I<00:01:11.490> think<00:01:11.580> that<00:01:11.820> sounds<00:01:12.090> amazing

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
restaurant I think that sounds amazing

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.300 
restaurant I think that sounds amazing
just<00:01:12.930> enough<00:01:13.110> for<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.320> liquid<00:01:13.770> nitrogen<00:01:14.040> to

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
just enough for the liquid nitrogen to

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:27.050 
just enough for the liquid nitrogen to
absorb<00:01:14.640> into<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.910> sponge<00:01:25.940> definitely<00:01:26.940> I've

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
absorb into the sponge definitely I've

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.340 
absorb into the sponge definitely I've
never<00:01:27.240> had<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.450> participation<00:01:28.050> like<00:01:28.170> that

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
never had a participation like that

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.710 
never had a participation like that
before<00:01:28.740> right<00:01:28.950> there's<00:01:29.670> essentially<00:01:30.300> a

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
before right there's essentially a

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:37.040 
before right there's essentially a
cracker<00:01:31.320> dough<00:01:35.000> small<00:01:36.000> hole<00:01:36.210> put<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.840> filling

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.650 
cracker dough small hole put the filling
in<00:01:37.170> honey<00:01:37.770> butter<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.250> we're<00:01:38.970> gonna<00:01:39.060> do<00:01:39.270> suck

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:39.660 
in honey butter and we're gonna do suck

all<00:01:50.860> I<00:01:50.980> can<00:01:51.160> think<00:01:51.190> about<00:01:51.370> right<00:01:51.520> now<00:01:51.700> is<00:01:51.790> back

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
all I can think about right now is back

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.640 
all I can think about right now is back
to<00:01:52.180> the<00:01:52.240> future<00:01:52.270> that<00:01:52.870> with<00:01:52.960> the<00:01:53.050> hoverboards

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 
to the future that with the hoverboards

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.100 
to the future that with the hoverboards
and<00:01:53.910> it's<00:01:54.910> literally<00:01:55.210> a<00:01:55.330> hoverboard<00:01:55.660> for

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
and it's literally a hoverboard for

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.810 
and it's literally a hoverboard for
perfect<00:01:56.620> I<00:01:56.770> think<00:01:57.040> that<00:01:57.220> there<00:01:57.370> is<00:01:57.460> a<00:01:57.490> lot<00:01:57.730> of

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
perfect I think that there is a lot of

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.250 
perfect I think that there is a lot of
people<00:01:58.060> giving<00:01:58.270> a<00:01:58.330> lot<00:01:58.480> more<00:01:58.630> thoughts<00:01:58.840> of<00:01:59.020> to

00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.260 
people giving a lot more thoughts of to

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.680 
people giving a lot more thoughts of to
presentations<00:01:59.950> and<00:02:00.940> doing<00:02:01.180> more<00:02:01.300> interesting

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
presentations and doing more interesting

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:02.910 
presentations and doing more interesting
any<00:02:01.810> other<00:02:01.930> bit<00:02:02.080> of<00:02:02.110> thing<00:02:02.440> I<00:02:02.620> mean<00:02:02.800> now<00:02:02.890> that

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
any other bit of thing I mean now that

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.260 
any other bit of thing I mean now that
this<00:02:03.160> is<00:02:03.340> out<00:02:03.460> there<00:02:03.670> people<00:02:03.910> are<00:02:04.090> really

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
this is out there people are really

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.550 
this is out there people are really
gonna<00:02:04.360> start<00:02:04.660> rethinking<00:02:04.810> how<00:02:05.170> to<00:02:05.230> play<00:02:05.440> these

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
gonna start rethinking how to play these

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.029 
gonna start rethinking how to play these
things<00:02:05.770> I<00:02:06.010> agree

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.800 

magic<00:02:10.819> I<00:02:10.849> don't<00:02:11.120> like<00:02:11.269> understanding<00:02:11.720> the

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
magic I don't like understanding the

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.059 
magic I don't like understanding the
science<00:02:12.049> behind<00:02:12.260> it<00:02:12.349> cuz<00:02:12.530> it<00:02:12.650> just<00:02:12.830> is<00:02:12.920> more

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
science behind it cuz it just is more

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:14.470 
science behind it cuz it just is more
magical<00:02:13.430> yeah<00:02:13.790> I<00:02:13.819> don't<00:02:14.090> even<00:02:14.150> want<00:02:14.360> to<00:02:14.420> know

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
magical yeah I don't even want to know

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.720 
magical yeah I don't even want to know
don't<00:02:14.780> tell<00:02:14.959> me<00:02:15.140> I<00:02:15.170> don't<00:02:15.439> what<00:02:16.189> approach<00:02:16.459> you

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
don't tell me I don't what approach you

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.460 
don't tell me I don't what approach you
don't<00:02:16.760> understand<00:02:17.299> it<00:02:17.420> anyway<00:02:17.750> but<00:02:18.140> just

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
don't understand it anyway but just

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:29.110 
don't understand it anyway but just
please<00:02:18.680> put<00:02:18.860> this<00:02:18.950> on
