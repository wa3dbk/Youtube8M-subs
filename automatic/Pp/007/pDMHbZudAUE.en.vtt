00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.379
 I do not know how many of you here actually like to be interviewed working with people 

00:00:07.608 --> 00:00:09.939
 Is it something that urges you to wake up every morning and say 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.079
 I really like to go and need to clean someone new 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.739
 Assistant or seller, factory products 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.379
 Or product manager? 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.169
 If we always want to be the right person 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.979
 Look at them and assume they are the right person 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.879
 Because we do not want to meet the next 50 people 

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:36.459
 Then ask questions that ensure they are the right person 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.769
 The appointment holds an opportunity to win 50% 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.669
 I do not know what you all are or what your chances were 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.399
 But if you turn back and say, 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.319
 How much error has been committed from 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.159
 Percentage of people who hired them? 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.214
 It is a risky operation 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.229
 You have to take this into account 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.369
 I think you have to spend a lot of time, in particular 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.129
 Try to make sure you are not making mistakes 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.089
 It turns out that the errors 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.939
 In people caused a corporate downturn 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.189
 So some research was done with a group of people 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.369
 From the Young Presidents Organization 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:25.989
 The estimate was that hiring people - the bad person cost $ 500,000 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.269
 But from my experience, the company often costs the whole 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.459
 The company loses because bad people do 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.109
 Making bad decisions 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.264
 They appoint other bad people 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.089
 So, one of your tasks as an entrepreneur is 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.649
 Recognize that you may be making a mistake 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.509
 Then be quick to try to resolve those errors 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.269
 People do not change 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.719
 You have to treat them with respect 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.604
 You have to give them the opportunity 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.554
 You have to provide them with your comments 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.514
 But in the end, your organization depends on the existence of great people 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.310
 You have to be tough
