 barcelona minecraft and today we are here 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.339
 with the ix the administrator of our 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.849
 faction server and our 

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:19.080
 server survival sun hello to all 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.289
 that we bring boyer ix today we bring the 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.230
 sorry 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:24.780
 the sniper rifle the sniper 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.870
 rifle 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:31.170
 agree this steel voice we have 

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:33.570
 here is the slider live loud and that we 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.210
 allow us to do this basically we 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.730
 allows remote shooting 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.980
 if we click right it makes us a 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.960
 small zoom that can also be enlarged 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.780
 if we have the optician it's a bit like that 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.110
 Check to 6 with control and right click 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.540
 we can do here a researched like this and 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.630
 makes guys that do a lot of damage 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:58.060
 but it takes time to recharge the noise 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.260
 It is also cured if the noise of this 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.970
 of 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.400
 from land and far 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.830
 you see, in fact, that my 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.380
 ammo counter now he pointed that 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.520
 cow in a couple of seconds extra dead 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.620
 As you can see I can not move now 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.690
 I'm giving like crazy I can not 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.970
 move while aiming for what with efe 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.520
 while you're after some you can not 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.070
 vote and we aim for the cow I do not know if there 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.900
 a villa in the middle 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.160
 and he is already dead 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:31.390
 the cri but the best endures a little more 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:34.190
 two are missing basically what you see 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:37.220
 It also has a recharge time but 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.900
 in comparison to rock &amp; lounge os 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.140
 we need the last time it seems more 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:46.010
 short 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:47.960
 yes I think it's more accurate I think it's a 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.580
 little longer 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.170
 but good is good because it can be done 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:55.020
 accurate retreats 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.260
 at a distance it does not seem that we have 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.250
 to worry about the subject d 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:04.250
 from the fall of baba 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.230
 oh yes that is calculated does not seem to be 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.170
 that not since it has perfectly straight 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:11.000
 that you can put some map and far away 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.590
 example on the beach in front of the 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.190
 house where we are now to see here 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.190
 wait for me to do at night 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.970
 and everything shoot from afar to see if there 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.970
 fall now or bullet 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:31.230
 there you have it 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:34.000
 I do not see it we go too far maybe 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.750
 yes up here on the beach 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.750
 Where are you 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.299
 before here this tree is a good 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:50.370
 site for place I'm not but next 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:52.590
 because I'm maimed so I also and 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.310
 so it seems let me put your 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.180
 same height 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:01.219
 and let's see 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.219
 forgive the egg center over here 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:05.180
 has been generated 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:12.420
 to see if there is 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.290
 so it seems now I'm going to make a 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.290
 shot is very flat 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:22.920
 it is as straight as it can be another case is 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:27.000
 that while it is recharging if we 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.890
 We change the inventory, we change 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.350
 what we have in the hand of the inventory 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:34.230
 Efe that separated if the remembered one stops 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.060
 for that is fine is realistic 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.340
 if you can do it with two there 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.540
 shooting infinitely to exact by 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.519
 example 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.230
 well here you have the krafft eo in the 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:47.819
 this chest we will see grace 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.819
 It is also a bit expensive 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.849
 you need crystal good glass like 

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:55.859
 these gas points are called panels of 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:59.129
 crystal glass walls to make the 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:04:01.930
 point the focus 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:04.680
 are not the proper technicalities about 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.680
 snipers 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.750
 have a technical name 3 copy that has 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:14.430
 mounted on top of the case I think it's 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:16.829
 the look will no longer be the goal the 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.419
 target we have the surprise goal 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:24.720
 also as something that shoot so 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:26.160
 good look if you notice is he 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:30.570
 it's funny how it's built 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:33.930
 because there are 22 steel ingots that 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:35.639
 they seem could be the cannon no other 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.800
 below as doing a little 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:40.979
 so cannon way with the butt the 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:45.860
 lever as trigger if the dispenser 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:48.020
 behind and above the mounted family 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.520
 it's very graphic it does not need to be 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.090
 you learn directly what you can do 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.090
 without more 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.270
 you have a pair of eyes of enders good 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.140
 one but 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.140
 it's okay 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.910
 to shoot my stars 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:13.470
 they are not these 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:16.140
 we will kill world 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:18.590
 if you can stop working, so 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.590
 seems to be 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.360
 well we have chances to fail 

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:25.280
 also by what I see 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.169
 if he keeps shooting there zombie that super 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.710
 well there in the head 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:29.710
 he has not given 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:36.660
 well I'm not sure 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:43.709
 I do not think it is holding back none 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:54.680
 and we are going to say that it is past 

00:05:56.529 --> 00:06:01.349
 apparently does not stop me from sucking from 

00:05:58.839 --> 00:06:01.349
 underwater 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:12.120
 Remember that if you do not do the zoom 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:16.010
 I would swear that everything we are going to see 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.010
 it's true it does not shoot under the water 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:23.440
 this has almost because I'm 

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:26.790
 shooting himself with crazy ice 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.790
 if I'm giving the bugs 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:35.660
 of agreement as this one is of the arms 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:37.760
 that go against the server and what 

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:39.950
 I give you a grace that you have is that 

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:42.639
 although you have ammunition always 

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:44.590
 you can use it as a telescope 

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:46.689
 to see I do not know I do not know why you think 

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:48.639
 zoom in like this to see if there are people away 

00:06:46.689 --> 00:06:51.249
 what he has said that is armed or 

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:55.120
 something like that a small are but yes that 

00:06:51.249 --> 00:06:57.270
 you can take advantage of the sniper as a 

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.400
 optical aid 

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:01.170
 Well, that's these other souls that 

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.670
 you will find and we still have some 

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:04.920
 how many more to explain we hope that 

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:06.960
 keep watching the channel to see if 

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:08.400
 there are new videos and to play in the 

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.690
 server you already know barcelona maker 

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.100
 dotcom may and cons and all the 

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:15.470
 necessary information 

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:15.470
 goodbye the hug everyone goodbye a hunt
