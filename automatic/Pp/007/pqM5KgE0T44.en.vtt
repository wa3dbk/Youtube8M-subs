00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.859
 Hello today I wanted to show you how 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.740
 to use a guitar with a guitar 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.059
 Tuning fork can tune 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:13.080
 I have my guitar for that now 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:16.529
 completely upset pretty much 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.800
 oblique so that a tuning fork the the 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:23.910
 has dead as you may know 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.190
 the one work and here is the one 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.780
 tone on 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:32.730
 and then there are still a few everywhere 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:33.930
 there are many sounds that have voices 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.240
 works so easy 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:41.420
 that hard and then holds it to the corpus 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:43.980
 then you hear the death of the guitar 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.830
 now you have to serve on the guitar 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.170
 and looking for exactly in the pitch 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:51.480
 is like the tuning fork 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:56.360
 in that case, that is down here 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.360
 fifth bunch on the side is one 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.839
 Now you have a clear one 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.839
 difference 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.140
 then you have to 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:20.740
 until the tone coincides with the sound 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.740
 do another 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.010
 you can hear it is still there 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.010
 difference 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:38.970
 so now the tones are over one now 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.280
 you have to change the other tones of the stage 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.350
 even with the property 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.800
 match 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:49.229
 Now we know that this page is here 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:53.090
 we have to have the right tone now 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:59.420
 grab and look here in the fifth fret 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:59.420
 that these two sides sound the same 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.560
 then we have to go to the side 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.560
 rotate 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.540
 I did too much 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.460
 now they agree well that 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.120
 Same word on the next page 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:39.430
 made 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:42.780
 only that at the side about it in the 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.780
 fourth bunch must grab 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.730
 hmm 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.890
 I can 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.860
 med 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.560
 so now the doors are closing in and out 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.900
 Now we have the exception here 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.780
 had grabbed that in the fourth bunch 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.100
 will be in the stages above it is always in the 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:07.860
 fifth bunch seized 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.860
 good at the sides 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:15.210
 the same thing done here too 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.850
 and if you've gone through it all 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:19.230
 up here again over a fifth 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.630
 then you have the guitar 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:23.130
 fully tuned yes and that will 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.280
 then also better than me 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.890
 but just with a tuning fork that can 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.210
 ever take some time 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.980
 if you like, I'll show you how 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.810
 you do that with a tuner 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:37.040
 You can do that very easily 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.040
 thank you for watching
