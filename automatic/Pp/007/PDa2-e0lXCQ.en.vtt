tank references we read this story it

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.540 
tank references we read this story it
makes<00:00:07.290> me<00:00:07.410> think<00:00:07.680> that<00:00:07.740> someone<00:00:08.309> merely

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
makes me think that someone merely

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.400 
makes me think that someone merely
hacked<00:00:08.940> a<00:00:09.090> YouTube<00:00:09.480> channel<00:00:09.510> to<00:00:09.900> give<00:00:10.230> out

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
hacked a YouTube channel to give out

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.740 
hacked a YouTube channel to give out
viruses<00:00:10.950> to<00:00:11.070> viewers<00:00:11.670> for<00:00:11.940> shock<00:00:12.150> value<00:00:12.240> I

viruses to viewers for shock value I

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.660 
viruses to viewers for shock value I
mean<00:00:13.200> after<00:00:13.349> all<00:00:13.530> there<00:00:13.980> are<00:00:14.070> probably<00:00:14.400> ways

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
mean after all there are probably ways

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.400 
mean after all there are probably ways
to<00:00:14.910> make<00:00:15.089> it<00:00:15.120> so<00:00:15.389> you<00:00:15.480> can<00:00:15.750> make<00:00:15.929> your<00:00:16.020> YouTube

to make it so you can make your YouTube
page<00:00:16.590> look<00:00:16.890> demonic<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:17.640> have<00:00:17.880> other<00:00:18.180> details

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
page look demonic and have other details

to<00:00:18.779> scare<00:00:19.020> your<00:00:19.140> viewers<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:20.010> given<00:00:20.400> that

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490

this channel was apparently in the early
times<00:00:22.410> at<00:00:22.560> YouTube<00:00:22.920> it<00:00:23.189> is<00:00:23.490> plausible<00:00:23.820> that

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
times at YouTube it is plausible that

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.189

this<00:02:30.870> was<00:02:31.050> disgusting<00:02:31.710> so<00:02:32.040> I<00:02:32.070> decided<00:02:32.460> to

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
this was disgusting so I decided to

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.940 
this was disgusting so I decided to
pause<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:32.940> video<00:02:33.060> it<00:02:33.960> didn't<00:02:34.260> let<00:02:34.410> me<00:02:34.560> because

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
pause the video it didn't let me because

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.070 
pause the video it didn't let me because
it<00:02:35.130> wasn't<00:02:35.280> responding<00:02:35.760> I<00:02:36.060> decided<00:02:36.840> then<00:02:37.050> to

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
it wasn't responding I decided then to

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.110 
it wasn't responding I decided then to
close<00:02:37.380> Internet<00:02:37.740> Explorer<00:02:38.280> but<00:02:38.820> it<00:02:38.970> went

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
close Internet Explorer but it went

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.570
