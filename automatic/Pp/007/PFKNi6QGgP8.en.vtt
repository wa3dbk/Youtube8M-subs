00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
my favorite new ideas as far as a

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.900 
my favorite new ideas as far as a
technique<00:00:09.990> is<00:00:10.530> concerned<00:00:11.070> it<00:00:11.340> involves

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
technique is concerned it involves

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.759 
technique is concerned it involves
barring<00:00:12.540> with<00:00:12.719> your<00:00:12.840> third<00:00:13.049> finger<00:00:13.080> across

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
barring with your third finger across

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.890 
barring with your third finger across
two<00:00:14.099> adjacent<00:00:14.400> strings<00:00:14.940> in<00:00:15.240> this<00:00:15.420> case<00:00:15.660> with

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
two adjacent strings in this case with

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.810 
two adjacent strings in this case with
this<00:00:16.020> look<00:00:16.170> I'm<00:00:16.289> going<00:00:16.410> to<00:00:16.500> show<00:00:16.680> you<00:00:16.820> we're

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
this look I'm going to show you we're

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.640 
this look I'm going to show you we're
going<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:18.000> just<00:00:18.090> be<00:00:18.210> barring<00:00:18.600> across<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.500> B

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
going to just be barring across the B

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.970 
going to just be barring across the B
and<00:00:19.830> E<00:00:19.949> string<00:00:20.250> at<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.520> 17th<00:00:21.270> fret<00:00:21.980> we're

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
and E string at the 17th fret we're

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.200 
and E string at the 17th fret we're
going<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.160> be<00:00:23.220> playing<00:00:23.340> in<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.670> key<00:00:23.880> of<00:00:23.910> a

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
going to be playing in the key of a

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.500 
going to be playing in the key of a
major<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.550> lick<00:00:26.550> I'm<00:00:26.880> going<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.180> play<00:00:27.330> it

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
major and the lick I'm going to play it

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.410 
major and the lick I'm going to play it
at<00:00:27.630> first<00:00:27.810> just<00:00:28.109> slowly<00:00:29.000> before<00:00:30.000> we<00:00:30.330> actually

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
at first just slowly before we actually

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.450 
at first just slowly before we actually
played<00:00:30.720> over<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:30.960> progression<00:00:31.500> so<00:00:32.279> you<00:00:32.340> can

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
played over the progression so you can

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:44.050 
played over the progression so you can
get<00:00:32.520> idea<00:00:32.820> of<00:00:32.910> where<00:00:33.090> it's<00:00:33.210> going

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:44.060 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.880 

and<00:00:44.150> what<00:00:44.990> were<00:00:45.080> the<00:00:45.110> progression<00:00:45.560> it<00:00:45.650> sounds

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
and what were the progression it sounds

00:00:45.890 --> 00:01:12.120 
and what were the progression it sounds
pretty<00:00:46.040> cool<00:00:46.220> let's<00:00:46.430> check<00:00:46.610> it<00:00:46.700> out

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.859 

I<00:01:12.189> just<00:01:12.909> check<00:01:13.060> that<00:01:13.180> one<00:01:13.390> out<00:01:13.479> a<00:01:13.659> little

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
I just check that one out a little

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:15.480 
I just check that one out a little
slower<00:01:14.350> this<00:01:14.590> plate<00:01:14.860> of<00:01:14.979> the<00:01:15.039> progressions

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
slower this plate of the progressions

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:28.660 
slower this plate of the progressions
the<00:01:15.700> little<00:01:15.909> slower

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.710 

alright<00:01:29.670> so<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:30.000> practice<00:01:30.390> this<00:01:30.510> technique

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
alright so to practice this technique

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.080 
alright so to practice this technique
start<00:01:31.260> off<00:01:31.350> very<00:01:31.470> slow<00:01:31.950> paying<00:01:32.820> special

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
start off very slow paying special

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.200 
start off very slow paying special
attention<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.600> your<00:01:33.780> third<00:01:33.990> finger<00:01:35.210> when

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
attention to your third finger when

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.960 
attention to your third finger when
you're<00:01:36.360> not<00:01:36.480> barring<00:01:37.260> the<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.370> E<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:38.640> B

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
you're not barring the the E and B

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.910 
you're not barring the the E and B
string<00:01:39.330> you<00:01:39.900> want<00:01:40.080> to<00:01:40.200> just<00:01:40.380> play<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.740> B

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
string you want to just play the B

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.540 
string you want to just play the B
string<00:01:41.220> with<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:42.180> tip<00:01:42.420> of<00:01:42.540> your<00:01:42.690> third<00:01:42.900> finger

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
string with the tip of your third finger

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.130 
string with the tip of your third finger
that<00:01:44.550> way<00:01:44.730> it<00:01:44.910> allows<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.390> E<00:01:45.420> string<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.930> ring

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
that way it allows the E string to ring

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.690 
that way it allows the E string to ring
below<00:01:46.470> when<00:01:46.830> you<00:01:46.920> want<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.190> grab<00:01:47.310> some<00:01:47.370> of<00:01:47.640> the

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
below when you want to grab some of the

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.370 
below when you want to grab some of the
notes<00:01:47.880> with<00:01:48.090> either<00:01:48.300> you're<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.630> second<00:01:49.140> finger

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
notes with either you're a second finger

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.230 
notes with either you're a second finger
where<00:01:49.530> your<00:01:49.680> first<00:01:49.920> finger<00:01:50.160> so<00:01:50.910> just<00:01:51.090> practice

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
where your first finger so just practice

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.570 
where your first finger so just practice
this<00:01:51.510> very<00:01:51.750> slow<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:53.100> should<00:01:53.250> sound<00:01:53.430> like

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
this very slow and it should sound like

00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:16.460 
this very slow and it should sound like
this

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.950 

a<00:02:16.530> you<00:02:17.250> can<00:02:17.400> turn<00:02:17.550> us<00:02:17.730> into<00:02:17.880> a<00:02:18.030> you<00:02:18.600> know<00:02:18.720> pretty

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
a you can turn us into a you know pretty

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.410 
a you can turn us into a you know pretty
