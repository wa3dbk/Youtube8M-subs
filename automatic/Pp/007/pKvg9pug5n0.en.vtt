00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:19.789 
back from the year before and kind of

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:22.210 
back from the year before and kind of
just<00:01:20.630> get<00:01:20.869> those<00:01:21.049> cobwebs<00:01:21.440> out<00:01:21.860> of<00:01:22.009> the<00:01:22.100> way

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
just get those cobwebs out of the way

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.520 
just get those cobwebs out of the way
and<00:01:22.520> I<00:01:22.759> mean<00:01:23.030> for<00:01:23.299> me<00:01:23.330> I<00:01:23.450> don't<00:01:23.780> go<00:01:24.020> in<00:01:24.200> with<00:01:24.380> any

expectation<00:01:25.310> into<00:01:25.520> sold<00:01:25.729> and<00:01:25.880> I<00:01:25.940> think<00:01:26.149> it's

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
expectation into sold and I think it's

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.630 
expectation into sold and I think it's
sort<00:01:26.539> of<00:01:26.659> a<00:01:26.720> bonus<00:01:27.080> race<00:01:27.319> and<00:01:27.649> it's<00:01:28.159> really<00:01:28.429> fun
