in the top of the seal of the mask and

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
this will just create a little a little

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.420 
this will just create a little a little
track<00:00:55.110> I<00:00:55.140> guess<00:00:55.410> for<00:00:55.590> water<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:55.950> trickle<00:00:56.190> in

why snore thing around could be can be a

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.990 
why snore thing around could be can be a
little<00:00:58.740> bit<00:00:58.860> annoying<00:00:59.100> so<00:00:59.340> just<00:00:59.730> give<00:00:59.850> your

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
little bit annoying so just give your

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.630 
little bit annoying so just give your
brow<00:01:00.150> white<00:01:00.510> when<00:01:00.720> you<00:01:00.810> pop<00:01:00.990> your<00:01:01.140> mask<00:01:01.320> on

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
another very common one is we smile and

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.130 
another very common one is we smile and
underwater<00:01:05.909> it's<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.450> very<00:01:06.659> common<00:01:06.960> thing<00:01:07.079> to

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
underwater it's a very common thing to

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.419 
underwater it's a very common thing to
do<00:01:07.380> but<00:01:07.560> if<00:01:07.679> you<00:01:07.770> can't<00:01:07.979> avoid<00:01:08.219> it

do but if you can't avoid it
I<00:01:08.520> know<00:01:08.609> it's<00:01:08.850> hard<00:01:08.999> it<00:01:09.659> probably<00:01:09.990> is<00:01:10.079> a<00:01:10.109> better

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:10.259 
I know it's hard it probably is a better

bit of a moustache that will create
difficulty<00:01:25.439> in<00:01:25.619> creating<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.069> seal<00:01:26.310> at<00:01:26.789> the

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
difficulty in creating a seal at the

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:32.629 
moustache a little bit of Vaseline on it
and<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:32.069> all<00:01:32.189> assists<00:01:32.490> in<00:01:32.609> creating

00:01:32.629 --> 00:01:32.639 
and and that all assists in creating

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:34.459 
and and that all assists in creating
that<00:01:33.119> seal<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.479> then<00:01:33.960> you'll<00:01:34.170> have<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.319> much

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:34.469
