00:00:00.355 --> 00:00:03.735
 are you ready? 

00:00:03.735 --> 00:00:08.075
 Come here 喔

00:00:08.075 --> 00:00:14.075
 This picture is called Wolf Wolf 300 LOL 

00:00:14.075 --> 00:00:16.815
 Welcome everyone to watch the tower of the gods! I am JC! 

00:00:16.815 --> 00:00:21.435
 Thank you very much for participating in the last Magic Stone event! 

00:00:21.435 --> 00:00:27.735
 The answer is still filtering! Please be patient! 

00:00:27.735 --> 00:00:33.695
 Today we play this....wood bigbang 

00:00:33.695 --> 00:00:40.975
 Victory (seungri) 

00:00:40.975 --> 00:00:45.095
 A friend told me that it’s so dark and strong. 

00:00:45.095 --> 00:00:49.535
 Then let me give it a try! 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:57.580
 He said that madness = high attack and high blood 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.480
 R1 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.160
 To save a skill 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:17.860
 Also, in fact, the combo can tell us whether the second attack will kill us... 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.120
 What is the strong lol? 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.380
 Just turn high combo and ok 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:36.480
 Plus this madness = Mozu 2 times attack, 1.5 times life and reply 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:47.580
 Here are three gg me... not afraid, can second their 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.920
 ....Super strong 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:02:05.780
 I didn't want to liberate him at first... but now I have changed it! 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:14.640
 If you can, you can save your skills. 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.360
 Root........ 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:28.140
 Here is the second of him.... And I want to know, how much blood can a group of beads return? 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.900
 Back full... 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.340
 Because the Mozu’s own reply is quite high. 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:41.180
 Let's try this team! 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:54.440
 With this team, there is a little bit of black emperor with a feeling of self! 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.560
 Same color 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.560
 In fact, this team is really strong enough. 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:14.020
 Here....no messing in is a good thing~ because I hate two seconds to turn LOL 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:20.460
 Look, the water is mad and 100000.... 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:30.060
 Super high attack 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:43.720
 So many days will be! Goodbye! 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.840
 The leader is not jumping 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:04:01.100
 That saves the skill, he cd 3 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.540
 Yes! 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:16.300
 Have skills to open it~ haha 

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.820
 Let’s open it yourself. 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:36.400
 Yes.... 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.958
 ......... 

00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.578
 Turning wrong.... 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:42.420
 Zero day drop 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:43.460
 No more, no more, no more, no more. 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:44.900
 With the possession, there is 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.520
 LOL 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.160
 The dark mad team is super strong and doesn't want to disappoint me! Hahahaha 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.680
 Turn the wrong bead to win 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.640
 Let's try this team! 

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:01.880
 Also participated in the event last time~ Please be patient! 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.600
