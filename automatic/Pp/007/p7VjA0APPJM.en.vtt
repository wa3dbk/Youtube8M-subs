00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 
I'm going to use a mix of carob powder

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.390 
I'm going to use a mix of carob powder
and<00:01:36.850> cacao<00:01:37.479> now<00:01:38.110> you<00:01:38.170> can<00:01:38.439> use<00:01:38.590> raw<00:01:38.860> or<00:01:39.130> roasted

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400

that's<00:01:39.820> your<00:01:40.000> choice<00:01:40.240> but<00:01:40.570> carrot<00:01:41.409> powder<00:01:41.670> is

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
that's your choice but carrot powder is

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.840 
that's your choice but carrot powder is
very<00:01:43.840> sweet<00:01:44.619> and<00:01:44.920> it<00:01:45.040> doesn't<00:01:45.430> contain<00:01:45.670> any

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
very sweet and it doesn't contain any

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.780 
very sweet and it doesn't contain any
stimulants<00:01:46.780> so<00:01:47.470> I<00:01:47.500> like<00:01:47.890> to<00:01:48.070> combine<00:01:48.280> both

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
since cacao does contain stimulants and

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.600 
since cacao does contain stimulants and
it's<00:01:51.430> quite<00:01:51.700> bitter<00:01:52.229> then<00:01:53.229> just<00:01:53.650> a<00:01:53.890> little<00:01:54.430> bit

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610
