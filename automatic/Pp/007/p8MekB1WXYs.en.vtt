 the park up to reopen it 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.690
 can always figure out what you're looking at 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.940
 Manpower needed hands and it needed 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.850
 is already a force act and you can 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.710

 temperatures during rain and storm and that 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.899
 one feels also here in 55 meters height 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.700

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.700

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.010
