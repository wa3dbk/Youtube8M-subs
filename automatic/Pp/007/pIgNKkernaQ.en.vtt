through the middle just to keep it

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.969 
through the middle just to keep it
together<00:01:25.030> you're<00:01:25.390> going<00:01:25.510> to<00:01:25.570> find<00:01:25.900> that<00:01:26.770> the

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
together you're going to find that the

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:29.490 
together you're going to find that the
pieces<00:01:27.400> will<00:01:27.550> want<00:01:27.729> to<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.990> fly<00:01:29.140> about

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
pieces will want to to fly about

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.620 
pieces will want to to fly about
separately<00:01:29.979> if<00:01:30.220> you<00:01:30.340> don't<00:01:30.580> secure<00:01:31.450> them

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
separately if you don't secure them

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.270 
separately if you don't secure them
together<00:01:31.810> so<00:01:32.229> you<00:01:32.320> can<00:01:32.440> secure<00:01:32.740> them<00:01:32.950> however

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
together so you can secure them however

and<00:02:11.200> I<00:02:11.290> will<00:02:11.470> show<00:02:11.739> you<00:02:11.800> that<00:02:12.070> but<00:02:12.310> what<00:02:12.370> I<00:02:12.489> want

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
and I will show you that but what I want

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.750 
and I will show you that but what I want
to<00:02:12.880> show<00:02:13.090> you<00:02:13.150> is<00:02:14.010> is<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:15.250> process<00:02:15.670> of

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
to show you is is the process of

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.699 
to show you is is the process of
crinkling<00:02:16.239> up<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:16.510> petals<00:02:16.750> before<00:02:17.350> it<00:02:17.470> gets

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
crinkling up the petals before it gets

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.309 
crinkling up the petals before it gets
wet<00:02:18.120> just<00:02:19.120> to<00:02:19.239> save<00:02:19.450> time<00:02:19.480> for<00:02:19.930> the<00:02:19.989> video<00:02:20.260> so

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
wet just to save time for the video so

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.199 
wet just to save time for the video so
what<00:02:20.590> you<00:02:20.680> want<00:02:20.860> to<00:02:21.010> do<00:02:21.190> once<00:02:21.850> it's<00:02:22.030> your

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
what you want to do once it's your

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.300 
what you want to do once it's your
chosen<00:02:22.720> color<00:02:22.989> you're<00:02:23.680> just<00:02:23.920> going<00:02:24.070> to<00:02:24.100> get

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
chosen color you're just going to get

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.759 
chosen color you're just going to get
each<00:02:24.579> layer<00:02:24.910> and<00:02:25.209> you're<00:02:25.540> going<00:02:25.810> to<00:02:25.840> bring

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
each layer and you're going to bring

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:28.350 
each layer and you're going to bring
them<00:02:26.980> together<00:02:27.160> towards<00:02:27.790> the<00:02:27.940> middle<00:02:28.180> and

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
them together towards the middle and

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.509 
them together towards the middle and
crinkle<00:02:28.840> them<00:02:28.959> up<00:02:29.079> so<00:02:29.380> now<00:02:29.620> on<00:02:29.829> to<00:02:30.040> the<00:02:30.190> next

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
crinkle them up so now on to the next

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:33.420 
crinkle them up so now on to the next
layer<00:02:31.019> and<00:02:32.019> just<00:02:32.410> sprinkle<00:02:32.890> them<00:02:32.980> up<00:02:33.130> in<00:02:33.310> the

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
layer and just sprinkle them up in the

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:40.070 
layer and just sprinkle them up in the
middle<00:02:33.670> now<00:02:34.540> on<00:02:34.690> to<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:34.959> next<00:02:35.200> layer

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.630 

it's<00:02:41.080> not<00:02:41.260> really<00:02:41.560> fiddly<00:02:41.830> you've<00:02:42.250> just<00:02:42.489> got

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
it's not really fiddly you've just got

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.979 
it's not really fiddly you've just got
to<00:02:42.670> try<00:02:42.940> and<00:02:43.000> find<00:02:43.150> each<00:02:43.360> separate<00:02:43.810> there

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
to try and find each separate there

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:45.839 
to try and find each separate there
guess<00:02:44.620> it<00:02:44.769> wouldn't<00:02:45.040> matter<00:02:45.220> if<00:02:45.430> you<00:02:45.550> did<00:02:45.730> more

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849 
guess it wouldn't matter if you did more

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:47.580 
guess it wouldn't matter if you did more
than<00:02:45.910> one<00:02:46.209> there<00:02:46.390> at<00:02:46.510> a<00:02:46.569> time<00:02:46.780> and<00:02:47.379> you're<00:02:47.530> just

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
than one there at a time and you're just

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.770 
than one there at a time and you're just
going<00:02:47.890> to<00:02:48.010> build<00:02:48.099> up<00:02:48.370> the<00:02:48.550> flour<00:02:51.180> until<00:02:52.180> all

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
going to build up the flour until all

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.930 
going to build up the flour until all
layers<00:02:53.110> have<00:02:53.560> been<00:02:53.590> crinkled<00:02:54.310> towards<00:02:54.760> the

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
layers have been crinkled towards the

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.410 
layers have been crinkled towards the
middle<00:02:55.709> crinkled<00:02:56.709> being<00:02:57.040> a<00:02:57.190> very<00:02:57.550> specialist

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
middle crinkled being a very specialist

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.050 
middle crinkled being a very specialist
