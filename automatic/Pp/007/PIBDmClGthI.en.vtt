 basic program commands to create a new project the application game 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:28.739
 - failed 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.229
 we already have here 

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:33.160
 initial project 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.160
 at last 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.850
 I know it's this 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.450
 local bishop

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.920
 We are going to close 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.380
 and now our project 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.710
 aracaju se 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.530
 in Santa Catarina 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.440
 this fear 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.750
 the House 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.740
 these lands 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.960
 but they have their application 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.960
 after friday 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 the extension object 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.990
 each extension 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.340
 station temperature 

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:10.999
 throughout its 

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:18.189
 there was suspension 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.709
 I liked the app 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:38.569
 if it is suspended 

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:47.889
 the commissioner 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.609
 and here we have the pretension to start from objects 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:55.569
 the assets 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:57.899
 mainly to create 

00:02:57.899 --> 00:03:00.519
 luiz the ahmadis 02 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:03.519

 can of paint 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.809
 heart 

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:39.739
 but ended today changing the image of an asset 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:41.319
 the article 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:44.319
 now it will be shown like this 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:48.389
 and if he had written in the selection 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:51.449
 they learn to give movement without this timinho 

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:54.449

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:13.689
 it's a separate window 

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:15.379

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.240
 the accs 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.199
 the two endings 

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:23.069
 can be said 

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:25.400
 if it were necessary 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.400
 changes stressed 

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:31.089

 You'll save what they could. 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.089
 if you are only a 

00:06:36.089 --> 00:06:39.089
 to change it at home 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:44.210
 Rafael 

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:47.169
 You will create a fence 

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:49.509
 approved for use 

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:52.509
 I at my run team in salvador 

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:58.510
 on the process return to the group to locate two files 

00:07:00.339 --> 00:07:02.490
 until the early afternoon the controller 

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:05.069
 my file that you assemble with people 

00:07:05.069 --> 00:07:08.069
 counting on the clicks eliabe that application 

00:07:09.889 --> 00:07:11.449
 bioactive 

00:07:11.449 --> 00:07:14.449
 as it has already been programmed with its eight injections 

00:07:18.699 --> 00:07:20.650
 the other reason is a file 

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:24.990
 baldwin this year I say I am safety advice ever since 

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:27.010
 it's a stable day file 

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:29.449
 of the entire project was created 

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:31.039
 from the customers' side 

00:07:31.039 --> 00:07:33.930
 the multimedia guide runs away 

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:37.490
 and already prepares the interface for you and gives you your game designed 

00:07:43.439 --> 00:07:47.240
 at this time you learned how to save media documents 

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.929
 to boeing documents 

00:07:48.929 --> 00:07:51.429
 compiled and xlt will be played 

00:07:51.429 --> 00:07:54.429
 and it would be an explosion hit the project 

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.259
 Next class we will open 

00:07:57.259 --> 00:07:58.960
 south multimedia program 

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.870
