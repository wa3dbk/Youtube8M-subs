00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:26.000
 very rewarding because it was the merit of 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.970
 students 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.430
 effort and because each 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.590
 not only at school but at home too. 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.540
 many people have accessed the 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.320

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.360
 whole day 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.090
 but it's not just studying the whole day is a 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:44.120
 set is the teachers become their 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:48.520

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.520

 platform type of case has no internet 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.570

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:33.340
 show shows it will show 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.500

 behind the difficulties at NASA 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.740
 difficulty is the big goal is that it is 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.440
