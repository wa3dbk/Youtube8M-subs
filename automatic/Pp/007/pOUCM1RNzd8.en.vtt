00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.100
 r with this freight and sports to touch someday why not the jackpot these are 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.180
 treasure hunters for them heritage days 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.890
 it's all year long it's even a source of income 

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.030
 some do not hesitate to switch to metal detector 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.609
 archaeological sites freshly discovered they are called then 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.220
 looters christophe sites that squeeze and alexey the same rank investigation 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.340
 beginning of June the National Institute for Preventive Archaeological Research 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.140
 the press is suitable 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.410
 to the football that his teams perform on a Gallic farm his finished part in the 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.909
 green 

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:32.039
 the next night 

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:35.399
 the site is massacred by looters armed with metal detectors and 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:36.179
 pickaxes 

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:39.289
 who ruminates in a few hours the meticulous work of archaeologists 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.630
 attracted by words but to the effigy of the Gallic emperor posthumus shown 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.200
 by the researchers they found in the local press a plan of access to 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.880
 sites that were not kept 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.420
 they moved they observed they looted like windy zara jussiê 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.500
 2064 year ago 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.960
 what happened to them 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.010
 it is perfectly scandalous it is a certainty fruits in progress 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.670
 so 100 e just lighten by precaution jean-claude was already 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.490
 passed to the detector along undrawn areas and so that I think that 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:10.020
 summer 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.820
 it states the damage is relatively limited the detectors of 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.690
 metals have spread in France for 25 years 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.880
 the number of points in France is estimated at 300,000 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.980
 that's how we call them familiarly 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.050
 which three months ago was taking place the championship of France detection in 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.450
 Parisian region 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.630
 if for most users it's a hobby often 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.000
 combined with a real historical interest 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.980
 it is obvious that faith is a formidable object in bad hands 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:35.840
 intentioned 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.860
 and that's why the law is clear 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.020
 but the little teaser of the material allowing the detection of objects 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.090
 metal to the word search effect 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.360
 an immense and objects that may be interested prehistory history 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.540
 wheel archeology without first obtaining an authorization 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.330
 administrative 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.110
 and as these authorizations are delivered drop by drop by 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.300
 prefectures nobody asks him 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.609
 archeological sites are obviously prohibited to detection 

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:01.440
 as well as several departments 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.960
 hair manners do not often declare objects found material 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.600
 is increasingly performing the detection of deeper and deeper 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.600
 up to 80 centimeters with this device 

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:16.399
 it's a girlfriend it's a molding of 

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:19.619
 the wise twilight this moment recognized 

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:24.039
 that we have montréal because celebrations of our detector 

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:27.069
 and able to detect some very important 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:31.809
 very deeply it is more and more precise and hare time distinguish 

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:34.279
 same pole the precious metals of 

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:37.389
 closed since that will surely be a feather 

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:41.179
 more powerful will increase the risks associated with its great good of 

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:44.179
 pro-cnt sources for purpose of parra 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.560
 and in Africa the most beautiful pieces are usually found on the sites 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.669
 archaeological discovered by detection 

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:53.259
 he will combine the afp got to know 

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:56.529
 those who find them two goals away not out of fear of the policeman 

00:02:56.529 --> 00:02:59.529
 some of these parts the interested on my mini-pc 

00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:12.089
 he said he had because from 

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:14.589
 if we declare from the outset in the departments that are suffering from 

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:15.639
 detection 

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:18.480
 I do not see how we can do it 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.760
 as for him said edi rama has found that excellent and will not ensure the 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.399
 royalty management 

00:03:23.399 --> 00:03:26.749
 wallace spearmon biya we have to do 

00:03:26.749 --> 00:03:29.779
 because he risks on the internet the legislation is for now 

00:03:29.779 --> 00:03:31.019
 like that 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.019
 6% and the legislation is a bit more 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:35.630
 we could perhaps 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:36.719
 extracts 

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:39.719
 100% control 

00:03:40.529 --> 00:03:42.699
 we have a little more discreet prison 

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:45.699
 akira 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:48.989
 to get an idea of ​​what can happen 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.879
 just go for a ride on the auction site on the internet every 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:53.899
 specialist discussion forums 

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:56.909
 this is of course not all been found by chance bickering about 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:58.119
 archaeological sites 

00:03:58.119 --> 00:04:01.409
 and most of the time the sellers do not even know what it's worth 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:05.829
 this rare or insufficiently merovingian coin has gone to 800 iso 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:07.949
 it is probably necessary that if more 

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:10.949
 so the prospectors all the scoundrels certainly not 

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:15.239
 the two categories Indian there are people working within 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.709
 associations 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:18.659
 of 

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:23.179
 % prospectors stand and who abide by the law and then next to 

00:04:23.179 --> 00:04:27.399
 you have a number of areas of individuals that picks up annual fees 

00:04:27.399 --> 00:04:29.599
 knowingly to the current law 

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:32.720
 but to loot archaeological sites and to resell it 

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:36.080
 their finds from what has become more expensive easier now with 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.039
 Internet 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:40.509
 and among the promoters of an ethically responsible detection of life 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:43.919
 the confusers of detection magazines 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:47.110
 well aware that some scoundrels are doing considerable harm not only 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.050
 heritage but also the detection of leisure 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.050
 he advocates for a real dialogue with archaeologists 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:56.230
 on each side and returns to extremes 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.020
 sit extreme archelogs hate prospectors some 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.420
 state inspectors that archaeologists nantes it would take it 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.660
 that tonight a table like and already say try to discuss happen to a 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:05.650
 compromise 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.030
 indeed the prospectors should sign a kind of charter that commits them to 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.790
 do not go to the sites but another side the prospectors should 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:18.460
 have the right supposed to be harassed by a water fit and 9 others for that 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.020
 to be able to detect a little to know about the famous sesame pennautier and to 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.180
 amy strattice authorization 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.620
 most of the objects found are cans 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.960
 capsules stride armrests 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.120
 the prospector rarely makes a fortune against a journalist arise the 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.909
 find 

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:40.080
 he is arrested because all these local craftsmen of the 2nd century BC 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.629
 outside of course 

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:43.330
 he has for ten thousand euros 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.360
 alas the prospector is facing his conscience I declare that I look 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:48.819
 I think 

00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:52.800
 that the destruction due to major development works are globally 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.060
 more worrying blow than that of metal detectors every year 

00:05:57.059 --> 00:06:01.659
 in development this account 1000 new hectares of the French territory that 

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:05.490
 means a comfortable square meter world my player past the shovels 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:09.309
 mechanical and the archaeologists follows the fire comes on about 15% 

00:06:09.309 --> 00:06:12.309
 to drop surface 

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:16.849
 all these pieces found illegally deserve to be 

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:17.600
 investigated 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.909
 to learn more about history 

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:22.330
 a useful legislative arrangement needed for the moment 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:25.469
 it's the status quo 

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:28.939
 so françois de mazières question adista terence for or against 

00:06:28.939 --> 00:06:30.240
 frying pans 

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.250
 the time the report is very well done because gives them all 

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:34.449
 response elements 

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:37.569
 - although there are excesses that are very dangerous and should be avoided 

00:06:37.569 --> 00:06:41.039
 that they have treasures that disappear because people 

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:44.550
 not the good idea to go to declare them on the contrary by taking advantage of 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:45.710
 a shop 

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:48.520
 prices broken by the way like cytokines must certainly do 

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:49.879
 evolve the regulations 

00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:53.099
 I think I'm not a specialist issue the specialist of 

00:06:53.099 --> 00:06:55.680
 the interview and he was there at what the president will say 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.680
 which is the national research institute for preventive archeology 

00:06:59.499 --> 00:07:02.279
 which certainly has some amenities to do because he too has people from 

00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:05.550
 very good wills who want to discover things and constraints 

00:07:05.549 --> 00:07:09.629
 to involve as many as possible in their discovery when it was 

00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:12.759
 addressed during this broadcast there is the problem of heritage 

00:07:12.759 --> 00:07:13.590
 exist 

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:17.130
 it is necessary to discover protected from ground but also the patrimony that 

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:20.560
 creates that will be created in the future and you're passionate about it too 

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:24.070
 and and says you work since you're going to open next March she has 

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:25.069
 city ​​chaillot 

00:07:25.069 --> 00:07:30.780
 the concept to heritage and and architecture% and c it's important for 

00:07:30.779 --> 00:07:32.949
 we too, to be concerned about heritage tomorrow 

00:07:32.949 --> 00:07:34.400
 I think it's French 

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:38.100
 it's often we do not oppose people who love heritage to those who love 

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:39.749
 the contemporary architect 

00:07:39.749 --> 00:07:42.499
 and basically if we look good it's a bit nonsense
