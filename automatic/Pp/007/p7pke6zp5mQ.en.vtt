we put it here on buried hairs okay and

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.340 
we put it here on buried hairs okay and
then<00:01:21.680> and<00:01:22.680> this<00:01:22.950> has<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.340> be<00:01:23.659> here<00:01:24.659> for<00:01:25.259> about

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
then and this has to be here for about

then and this has to be here for about
one<00:01:26.009> hour<00:01:26.119> or<00:01:27.119> about<00:01:27.299> an<00:01:27.600> hour<00:01:27.720> one<00:01:28.290> hour<00:01:28.409> then

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
one hour or about an hour one hour then

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.870 
one hour or about an hour one hour then
the<00:01:29.280> salt<00:01:29.720> goes<00:01:30.720> in<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.549> it<00:01:32.670> has<00:01:32.850> a

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
the salt goes in and and it has a

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.170 
the salt goes in and and it has a
balancing<00:01:33.540> effect<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:34.229> it<00:01:34.350> takes<00:01:34.650> away<00:01:35.180> this

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
balancing effect and it takes away this

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.219 
balancing effect and it takes away this
inflammatory<00:01:37.159> pain<00:01:38.540> so<00:01:39.540> it<00:01:39.630> draws<00:01:39.810> out<00:01:40.079> the

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
inflammatory pain so it draws out the

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.770 
inflammatory pain so it draws out the
information<00:01:40.500> yeah<00:01:41.250> yeah<00:01:41.640> oh<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:42.450> does<00:01:42.630> is

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
information yeah yeah oh it does is

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.410 
information yeah yeah oh it does is
sawdust<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.649> so<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.189> salt<00:01:44.399> goes<00:01:44.670> goes<00:01:45.180> goes

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
sawdust and so the salt goes goes goes

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.770 
sawdust and so the salt goes goes goes
in<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.380> salt<00:01:46.710> can<00:01:47.460> can<00:01:47.939> go<00:01:48.149> through<00:01:48.540> there

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
in the salt can can go through there

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.389 
in the salt can can go through there
through<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.920> skin<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.490> in<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.420> body<00:01:52.009> okay<00:01:53.040> so

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
through the skin and in the body okay so
