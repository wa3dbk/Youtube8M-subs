braid<00:00:22.050> we're<00:00:22.439> going<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.619> start<00:00:22.800> with<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:22.920> large

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
braid we're going to start with a large

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.160 
braid we're going to start with a large
section<00:00:23.550> at<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:23.939> top<00:00:23.970> front<00:00:24.600> of<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.779> hair<00:00:24.990> and

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
section at the top front of the hair and

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.750 
section at the top front of the hair and
divide<00:00:25.529> that<00:00:25.800> into<00:00:25.980> three<00:00:26.099> even<00:00:26.730> sections

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
divide that into three even sections

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.269 
divide that into three even sections
you'll<00:00:27.660> begin<00:00:27.930> with<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.320> regular<00:00:28.800> braid<00:00:28.949> and

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
you'll begin with a regular braid and

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.669 
you'll begin with a regular braid and
then<00:00:29.670> proceed<00:00:30.090> like<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.300> French<00:00:30.630> braid<00:00:30.869> except

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
then proceed like a French braid except

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.430 
then proceed like a French braid except
you're<00:00:32.279> gonna<00:00:32.369> drop<00:00:32.940> this<00:00:33.329> piece<00:00:33.570> out<00:00:33.899> and

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
you're gonna drop this piece out and

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.950 
you're gonna drop this piece out and
take<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.250> whole<00:00:35.640> new<00:00:35.670> one<00:00:36.090> rather<00:00:36.420> than<00:00:36.719> adding

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
take a whole new one rather than adding

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.319 
take a whole new one rather than adding
to<00:00:37.290> it<00:00:37.440> cross<00:00:37.890> that<00:00:38.070> over<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.399> center<00:00:38.730> take<00:00:39.300> a

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
to it cross that over the center take a

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.450 
to it cross that over the center take a
piece<00:00:39.540> from<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.870> top<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.469> add<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:40.770> in<00:00:40.890> like<00:00:41.430> a

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
piece from the top and add it in like a

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.910 
piece from the top and add it in like a
regular<00:00:41.700> French<00:00:42.149> braid<00:00:42.379> then<00:00:43.379> take<00:00:43.710> that

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
regular French braid then take that

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.600 
regular French braid then take that
right<00:00:44.550> piece<00:00:44.910> drop<00:00:45.840> that<00:00:46.050> out<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.770> take<00:00:47.340> new

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
right piece drop that out and take new

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.729 
right piece drop that out and take new
hair<00:00:47.879> instead<00:00:48.210> this<00:00:48.989> is<00:00:49.170> going<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.469> have<00:00:49.620> you
