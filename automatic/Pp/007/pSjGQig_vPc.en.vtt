00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.900 
the Flex rating is a 3 on the 1 to 10
fluctuating<00:00:49.920> scale<00:00:50.190> it's<00:00:50.340> gonna<00:00:50.460> be<00:00:50.610> quite<00:00:50.850> a

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
fluctuating scale it's gonna be quite a

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.240 
fluctuating scale it's gonna be quite a
bit<00:00:51.090> softer<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.719> it's<00:00:51.870> going<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.140> flex<00:00:52.559> very

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
bit softer and it's going to flex very

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.580 
bit softer and it's going to flex very
consistently<00:00:54.120> now<00:00:54.780> one<00:00:55.020> thing<00:00:55.199> I<00:00:55.289> notice

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
consistently now one thing I notice

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.069 
consistently now one thing I notice
about<00:00:55.800> this<00:00:55.980> is<00:00:56.039> that<00:00:56.730> some<00:00:57.180> soft<00:00:57.510> boards<00:00:57.930> will

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
about this is that some soft boards will

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.590 
about this is that some soft boards will
like<00:00:58.230> flat<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.219> will<00:00:59.370> be<00:00:59.730> really<00:01:00.090> really<00:01:00.120> soft

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
like flat it will be really really soft

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.729 
like flat it will be really really soft
when<00:01:00.899> you're<00:01:00.989> pressing<00:01:01.260> them<00:01:01.559> or<00:01:01.710> just

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
when you're pressing them or just

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.290 
when you're pressing them or just
cruising<00:01:02.309> on<00:01:02.399> them<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.820> then<00:01:03.149> they'll

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
cruising on them and then they'll

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.789 
cruising on them and then they'll
they'll<00:01:03.719> be<00:01:03.840> like<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.019> dead<00:01:04.290> spot<00:01:04.559> where<00:01:04.710> it

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
they'll be like a dead spot where it

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.130 
they'll be like a dead spot where it
stops<00:01:05.100> flexi<00:01:05.519> well<00:01:05.970> this<00:01:06.090> thing<00:01:06.299> will<00:01:06.510> won't

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
stops flexi well this thing will won't

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.080 
stops flexi well this thing will won't
really<00:01:07.409> get<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.740> point<00:01:08.430> where<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:08.700> stops

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
really get to a point where it stops

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.179 
really get to a point where it stops
flexing<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:09.960> will<00:01:10.110> continue<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.710> flex<00:01:10.950> all<00:01:11.159> the

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
flexing it will continue to flex all the

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.890 
flexing it will continue to flex all the
way<00:01:11.340> through<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:11.909> that's<00:01:12.390> because<00:01:12.689> of<00:01:12.810> that
