already<00:01:07.049> as<00:01:07.229> well<00:01:10.159> so<00:01:11.159> get<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.369> little<00:01:11.430> bit<00:01:11.640> more

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
already as well so get a little bit more

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.560 
already as well so get a little bit more
turbo<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.330> use<00:01:12.750> that<00:01:13.020> but<00:01:13.740> uh<00:01:14.299> you<00:01:15.299> can<00:01:15.450> tell

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
turbo and use that but uh you can tell

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.670 
turbo and use that but uh you can tell
by<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.780> graphics<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.350> like<00:01:16.470> I<00:01:16.530> said<00:01:16.650> I

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
by the graphics and like I said I

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.160 
by the graphics and like I said I
decided<00:01:17.430> not<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.640> record<00:01:17.970> in<00:01:18.119> 4k<00:01:18.360> I<00:01:18.540> was<00:01:18.840> going

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170

guy<00:02:05.850> on<00:02:06.060> a<00:02:06.090> course<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:07.640> see<00:02:08.640> if<00:02:08.729> we<00:02:08.880> can't<00:02:09.179> be

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
guy on a course and see if we can't be

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:25.000 
guy on a course and see if we can't be
successful<00:02:09.990> here<00:02:10.590> a<00:02:10.619> little<00:02:10.800> bit

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:31.589 

I<00:02:25.069> mean<00:02:25.670> we're<00:02:25.790> getting<00:02:25.879> our<00:02:26.030> butt<00:02:26.269> kicked

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:34.220 

and<00:02:32.230> we<00:02:32.560> got<00:02:32.709> crunch<00:02:33.010> didn't<00:02:33.249> make<00:02:33.370> it<00:02:33.459> through

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
and we got crunch didn't make it through

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.720 
and we got crunch didn't make it through

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
so there's almost no way that I'm gonna

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.759 
so there's almost no way that I'm gonna
actually<00:02:37.030> catch<00:02:37.389> up<00:02:37.420> here<00:02:37.810> but<00:02:38.230> that's<00:02:38.379> okay

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.210 
that I'm recording this on a Galaxy s5

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.450 
that I'm recording this on a Galaxy s5
because<00:03:02.210> why<00:03:02.840> not<00:03:03.080> he's<00:03:03.920> got<00:03:04.100> an<00:03:04.190> awesome

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:04.460

because why not he's got an awesome
camera<00:03:05.080> so<00:03:06.080> now<00:03:06.320> that<00:03:06.380> the<00:03:06.650> spaceship<00:03:07.190> is

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
camera so now that the spaceship is

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:13.350 
camera so now that the spaceship is
taking<00:03:07.730> off

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:24.450 

just<00:03:13.900> jump<00:03:14.170> this<00:03:14.350> way

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:24.460 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.520 

oh<00:03:24.550> maybe<00:03:25.480> I<00:03:25.630> still<00:03:25.840> haven't<00:03:26.020> gotten<00:03:26.200> my<00:03:26.260> three

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
oh maybe I still haven't gotten my three

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.830 
oh maybe I still haven't gotten my three
seconds<00:03:26.920> to<00:03:26.980> air<00:03:27.130> time<00:03:27.340> so<00:03:27.670> I<00:03:28.450> have<00:03:28.600> to<00:03:28.690> make

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
seconds to air time so I have to make

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:47.820 
seconds to air time so I have to make
that<00:03:28.960> work<00:03:29.200> this<00:03:29.380> time

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.650 

I<00:03:47.920> should<00:03:48.610> have<00:03:48.700> used<00:03:48.790> the<00:03:48.910> Cadillac<00:03:49.390> it's<00:03:49.570> a

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
I should have used the Cadillac it's a

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.600 
I should have used the Cadillac it's a
little<00:03:49.870> bit<00:03:49.960> faster<00:03:50.380> than<00:03:50.410> the<00:03:50.560> Tesla<00:03:51.070> is<00:03:51.250> but

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
little bit faster than the Tesla is but

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.080 
little bit faster than the Tesla is but
that's<00:03:51.910> alright<00:03:53.430> so<00:03:54.430> here's<00:03:54.610> what<00:03:54.730> I<00:03:54.760> wanted
