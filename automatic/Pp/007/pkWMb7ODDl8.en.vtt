00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.240 
things of course if I look if I could
have<00:01:52.380> written<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.619> rest<00:01:52.770> again<00:01:52.979> I<00:01:53.070> would<00:01:53.159> have

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
have written the rest again I would have

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.830

just<00:01:53.369> had<00:01:53.399> her<00:01:53.549> up<00:01:53.670> there<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.000> if<00:01:54.299> she<00:01:54.479> went<00:01:54.689> to

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
just had her up there and if she went to

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.050 
just had her up there and if she went to
keen<00:01:55.079> should<00:01:55.229> have<00:01:55.320> been<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.560> keen<00:01:55.799> but<00:01:56.060> you

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
keen should have been to keen but you

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.120 
keen should have been to keen but you
know<00:01:57.180> she's<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.420> speed<00:01:57.719> finish<00:01:58.079> I<00:01:58.200> wanted<00:01:58.469> to<00:01:58.530> to

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
try and save her energy but she finished

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.480 
try and save her energy but she finished
third<00:02:03.240> she<00:02:03.450> should<00:02:03.630> have<00:02:03.719> won

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
third she should have won

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
they got me out of the equation pretty

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.809 
they got me out of the equation pretty
early<00:02:24.860> went<00:02:25.860> very<00:02:26.040> slow<00:02:26.250> at<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.459> horses<00:02:26.730> that

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
early went very slow at the horses that

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.790 
early went very slow at the horses that
came<00:02:26.970> around<00:02:27.209> me<00:02:27.390> I<00:02:27.569> mean<00:02:28.080> it<00:02:28.170> was<00:02:28.290> really

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
came around me I mean it was really

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:29.809 
came around me I mean it was really
crawled<00:02:29.040> around<00:02:29.190> the<00:02:29.340> horses<00:02:29.610> that<00:02:29.670> came

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
crawled around the horses that came

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.530 
crawled around the horses that came
around<00:02:30.000> me<00:02:31.730> they<00:02:32.730> didn't<00:02:33.030> they<00:02:33.269> didn't

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
around me they didn't they didn't

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.470 
around me they didn't they didn't
improve<00:02:34.080> the<00:02:34.230> positions<00:02:34.650> they<00:02:35.069> sat<00:02:35.480> mid

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
improve the positions they sat mid

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.630 
improve the positions they sat mid
divisional<00:02:37.080> for<00:02:37.769> the<00:02:37.860> back<00:02:38.010> of<00:02:38.160> a<00:02:38.250> very<00:02:38.430> slow

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
divisional for the back of a very slow

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.180 
divisional for the back of a very slow
pace<00:02:38.850> so<00:02:39.200> it<00:02:40.200> was<00:02:40.350> just<00:02:40.440> one<00:02:40.650> those<00:02:40.769> maneuvers

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
pace so it was just one those maneuvers

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.340 
pace so it was just one those maneuvers
that<00:02:41.340> was<00:02:41.489> very<00:02:41.840> it<00:02:42.840> was<00:02:42.930> very<00:02:42.989> annoying

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
that was very it was very annoying

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.070 
that was very it was very annoying
because<00:02:43.739> it<00:02:43.860> didn't<00:02:44.040> help<00:02:44.190> anyone<00:02:44.569> he<00:02:45.569> or<00:02:45.780> he

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
because it didn't help anyone he or he

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
because it didn't help anyone he or he
was<00:02:46.200> detrimental<00:02:46.709> for<00:02:47.100> me<00:02:48.410> so<00:02:49.410> I'm<00:02:49.620> sure<00:02:49.980> the

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
was detrimental for me so I'm sure the

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.000 
was detrimental for me so I'm sure the
winner<00:02:50.250> is<00:02:50.400> a<00:02:50.430> very<00:02:51.209> good<00:02:51.390> filly<00:02:51.600> but<00:02:52.010> you

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
winner is a very good filly but you

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.800 
winner is a very good filly but you
reckon<00:02:53.250> yours<00:02:53.430> is<00:02:53.519> better<00:02:53.670> she<00:02:54.000> should<00:02:54.720> have

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
reckon yours is better she should have

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.270 
reckon yours is better she should have
won<00:02:54.870> it<00:02:54.930> simple<00:02:55.380> as<00:02:55.440> that<00:02:55.620> I<00:02:55.920> know

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
won it simple as that I know

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.210 
won it simple as that I know
anyway<00:02:57.120> it's<00:02:58.080> interesting<00:02:58.380> that<00:02:58.650> you<00:02:58.799> you<00:02:59.069> had

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
anyway it's interesting that you you had

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.559 
anyway it's interesting that you you had
the<00:02:59.370> golden<00:02:59.610> opportunity<00:02:59.730> to<00:03:00.180> talk<00:03:00.420> about

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
the golden opportunity to talk about

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.210 
the golden opportunity to talk about
pretty<00:03:00.840> much<00:03:00.959> any<00:03:01.170> great<00:03:01.680> moment<00:03:02.040> of<00:03:02.130> the

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
pretty much any great moment of the

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.470 
pretty much any great moment of the
season<00:03:02.549> and<00:03:02.670> that's<00:03:02.790> the<00:03:02.940> one<00:03:03.090> thing<00:03:03.269> that's

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
season and that's the one thing that's

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.089
