oiling<00:01:09.119> which<00:01:09.299> is<00:01:09.479> cool<00:01:10.070> tool<00:01:11.070> is<00:01:11.159> about<00:01:11.280> ten

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
oiling which is cool tool is about ten

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.520 
oiling which is cool tool is about ten
percent<00:01:11.580> more<00:01:11.970> than<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.210> stock<00:01:12.510> filter<00:01:13.290> and

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
percent more than the stock filter and

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.320 
percent more than the stock filter and
cosworth<00:01:14.490> grains<00:01:14.700> up<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:14.970> ninety<00:01:15.240> eight

cosworth grains up to ninety eight

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.480 
cosworth grains up to ninety eight
percent<00:01:15.360> efficiency<00:01:16.110> so<00:01:16.979> it's<00:01:17.130> going<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.280> keep

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
percent efficiency so it's going to keep

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.340 
percent efficiency so it's going to keep
