00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.150
 in today's conversation 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.440
 the primary grenades I have 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.600
 now found a picture where you all 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.920
 can recognize well and then awarded 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.270
 I'll explain the effect to you shortly because 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.400
 we also have some new grenades with us 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.600
 where you probably have 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.740
 could not imagine anything at all 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.689
 because I could also before me completely under 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.740
 introduce and have in the first place 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.710
 we the flatrate so the 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.899
 splinter grenade and we already know 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.250
 from purchasing quantities and who has the 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.540
 can be easily thrown and that 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.100
 it's still a special thing about her 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.230
 so that can be here longer in 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.149
 hold the hand and then the 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.620
 thus throw could shorten the timer 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.700
 that the opponent quali no more chance 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.620
 to run away from it 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.090
 in the second place again an old one 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.550
 admittedly this text the end effect 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.110
 is already relatively well known and 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.520
 it will be a strong one again 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.530
 previous call of duty part night 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.559
 Expiration of the timer thus explode the 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.820
 petit and then yes it will explode 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.219
 will probably be that again 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.960
 you have pulled walls so to speak, that you 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.519
 which can then wrap up again without 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.950
 that can explode over with it 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.360
 the played did not know but that 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.320
 is very likely with the sentix 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.670
 to be like that again, I still have it 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.140
 not seen but it has always been 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.760
 so and why should that change that 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.200
 also is a sentix from the 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.820
 especially that they oppose and 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.860
 so that we can adhere to the enemies 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.570
 the strong ones and yes they know that 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.860
 probably almost everyone 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.090
 I noticed that all 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.549
 looks different somehow looks like 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.960
 now I'm so long out there I am 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.549
 curious if that changed anything 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.990
 how it is thrown, whether it's always 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.479
 still how are being thrown at or whether 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.850
 which now like such a drawer and the 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.710
 The soldier somehow threw something else 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.259
 if that 's just a way around two 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.759
 So I remember that very much 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.140
 elongated and that's why I could 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.670
 Imagine that they are so much more 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.570
 is flung then not anyway a 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.360
 ball is thrown 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.439
 but unfortunately I do not have any there yet 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.479
 I have not found out anything yet 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.850
 found and therefore we still have to 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.770
 wait for a third place back in 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.299
 Although well-known that quiet live and 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.740
 it looks a bit different too 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.659
 in the previous collective the parts 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.829
 because of that looks kind of 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.090
 a butcher knife I find it 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.860
 does not look like the previous ones 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.869
 he was so thin and 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.129
 maybe even two had that sound 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.740
 He has such a thick grip when I 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.740
 the 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.690
 Really recognize but that's it 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.950
 not so important to the defect of the 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.210
 altimeter can say that it 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.530
 probably an instant kill again 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.030
 So if you are going to do somebody 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.990
 then he will probably hit 100 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.270
 be dead by a percent 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.220
 it is almost one hundred percent that can 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.100
 say because if that was not true then 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.420
 would that be really bad and therefore 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.520
 that will be for sure again 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.140
 and where I'm not sure yet 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.520
 if you pick it up again with plunderer 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.930
 So if you can plunderer in mw3 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.570
 So equipped, one could the 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.980
 wurfmesser pick up again and was 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.060
 It was also the only premiere 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.250
 you could pick it up like that 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.780
 and I'm not sure if that 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.300
 are also gonna be like that again 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.860
 we'll see a fourth 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.260
 They have something new, namely that 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.450
 aig and that is the abbreviation for 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.340
 improvised explosive device as 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.870
 improvised speak charge so to speak 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.600
 this is a battle for the common 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.070
 terrorists and they do it often 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.510
 be used in attacks when the 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.340
 people have no access to the right one 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.810
 explosive we have determined 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.670
 then they build somebody there 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.890
 shit together and tilt there 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.300
 any households rhine and 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.050
 in something like that is that the idea 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.150
 also be 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.620
 Therefore, I can not exactly what 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.360
 Idea because it has a lot 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.150
 There are different types of ideas 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.440
 does not give the idea and that behaves 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.630
 always the same, there are many 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.550
 different varieties but what I like 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.930
 from live streams and trailers and such 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.680
 seen it behaves much like 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.350
 the c4 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.560
 So keep sinners and still can 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.120
 are similarly thrown and there are 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.040
 but not to objects like that 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.780
 c4 so that c4 can also come there 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.850
 By the way, that's easy 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.380
 stick walls and it will 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.550
 probably can not do that 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.510
 will probably be the difference 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.830
 Maybe you can do it a bit 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.750
 although not really 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.000
 looks round but probably will 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.860
 it just has that effect so then 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.270
 we can do it 50 to the c4 and the effect 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.710
 is actually relatively well known 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:55.900
 and it just explodes after it 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:57.220
 the detonator has triggered because I have to 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.930
 any case note that it again 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.550
 as in black ops 2 will go that way 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.720
 you move a cup twice that is yes 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.120
 always different from console too 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.010
 consoles and from pc to pc so from the 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.510
 attitude and it will be like that 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.120
 go that one suspects ace twice 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.770
 can and can not be denied 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.060
 igniter the soldier pulls the sinner 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.650
 not and therefore the weapon is even 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.000
 not gone and that was a black ops up 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.229
 every case very strong it was one of the 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.049
 many reasons why so much so 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:21.989
 Overboard was the work the ghost 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.240
 I give thunderstorms when I want 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.680
 why was the goal actually in too 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.120
 places where you could pull the detonator 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.280
 not too strong that was actually 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.300
 balanced and why this here now 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.099
 make it strong again 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.389
 but probably the c4 will then 

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:36.240
 but not such a high explosive power 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:37.319
 have because it is likely that 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.789
 black ops wise learned a bit 

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:39.780
 where have it been quite high 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:42.389
 had explosive force 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.710
 and well but sitting again like that 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:45.120
 he will be explosive with unfortunately still 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.229
 no information about it and that 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.330
 we will see only then if that 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:49.410
 Game is out there, though I can only 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.120
 must say that the four next ball 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.590
 team black ops 2 can be thrown 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.199
 That's where you come in for the 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.240
 half the world annoying and in cottbus for that 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:59.220
 he may be like mw3 that there are a few here 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.319
 Co-operation works as it does 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.669
 Realistic is yes and otherwise you can 

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:04.710
 say as just said it's 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:07.530
 objects and possibly it can 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.150
 even adhere to enemies because that's how it is 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.650
 a bit more blatantly separate from the idea 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.729
 but I would know that I have 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.220
 never seen one with a 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:15.840
 So much was said that is not 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.099
 Of course I could not 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.419
 I think so well, I think so 

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:20.880
 does not fit us much work the 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:22.560
 Nevertheless , we still have options like this 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.840
 Last year there was the canister bomb 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.250
 so the canister bomb and above have 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.979
 I unfortunately no information in real 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:30.449
 but so many can find out 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:32.159
 me in the trailers and livestreams 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:33.930
 I saw that a part was short 

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:36.030
 after it is thrown or exploded so 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:39.060
 because at least the trailers so that 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.539
 one there had indeed times hard time fully 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.190
 short 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:42.570
 and what I also noticed 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:44.190
 that this will not be thrown very far 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:45.840
 It may be even shorter than that too 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.180
 many have the idea to be thrown 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.770
 So it just does not fly very far 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.930
 because it's probably relative too 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:53.310
 may be difficult, it will, however, a 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.289
 very high explosive force so I'm mine 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.610
 Almost sure that the the 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:58.469
 Primary grenade with the highest 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.639
 Explosive will be without me 

00:05:58.469 --> 00:06:02.009
 play here or that I have 

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:04.289
 have any statistics but so 

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:05.430
 just sat in the trailers and yes 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:06.360
 each case six very interesting 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.190
 primarily advised 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.960
 which of course is striking that it 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:11.669
 another scene still another claymore 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.990
 There and yes here are the opinion 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:15.330
 a bit split, many say 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:17.130
 cds - find the claim very well and there 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:18.750
 There are people like me who actually 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:20.009
 more likely to be the claim so 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.810
 the first one at a time 

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:24.120
 chance to escape but the deadlock 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:25.590
 if there someone fed the war camp 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.810
 the countries the nip or tactically good 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:28.380
 has placed and how easy is 10 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:30.300
 chance 

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.620
 that was not just shit because it was 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.240
 just a real fighter tool 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:34.589
 but was in the year is 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.030
 most likely no jam and 

00:06:34.589 --> 00:06:37.340
 can 

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:38.840
 nicole for the big give something to everyone 

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.160
 case the gameplay bit change 

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.900
 is above all things free for all where 

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.760
 the people otherwise like the tactics 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:46.550
 I recognize myself in this building 

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:48.170
 or in this room and then suddenly 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:49.880
 because not smart, and then there's ne is 

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:53.180
 mine and yes that was definitely 

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:54.680
 pretty much free for all and me 

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.880
 as free for all players I see 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.110
 probably will ghost in itself 

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.730
 play for everyone because I'm in the 

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:00.650
 finals like to be free for everyone 

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:02.360
 play because somehow he's that good 

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:03.770
 Can play on sand and that makes me 

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:06.860
 fun and there I am with distance on 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:08.420
 best in it and for me that 

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:09.890
 plays offensively and that actually 

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:11.150
 does not play that he misjudges there 

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:13.430
 and usually no 

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:16.070
 It's actually clothes for me 

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:17.390
 practical and that's why I have to say 

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:19.190
 that I like that you are the one 

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:20.180
 both things have taken out but 

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:21.680
 I think it's really the first one 

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:23.180
 The two were not called call of duty 

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.160
 and therefore have the very old ones there 

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.720
 i have no idea about it i believe it 

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.790
 is the first head digital where the things 

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.200
 did not write in it around the year 

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:32.120
 Please tell me what you think about it 

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:34.130
 the good thing is that we did not claim 

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.090
 and no spd are there and that's it 

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:36.260
 video over I hope you have it 

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:38.090
 I like it if you like it 

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:41.140
 I am happy with myself and why 

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:41.140
 it was pure people today
