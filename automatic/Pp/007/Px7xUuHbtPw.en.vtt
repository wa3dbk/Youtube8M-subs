70 mile an hour that is your indicated
airspeed<00:00:11.880> that's<00:00:12.450> what<00:00:12.599> you're<00:00:12.780> reading<00:00:12.929> from

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
airspeed that's what you're reading from

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.519 
airspeed that's what you're reading from

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
your airspeed indicator the next one I

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.429 
your airspeed indicator the next one I
want<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:16.740> mention<00:00:16.890> is<00:00:17.250> true<00:00:18.150> airspeed<00:00:18.439> true

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
want to mention is true airspeed true

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:20.929 
want to mention is true airspeed true
our<00:00:19.590> speed<00:00:19.800> this<00:00:19.920> one<00:00:20.130> I<00:00:20.160> always<00:00:20.340> have<00:00:20.640> trouble

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
our speed this one I always have trouble

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.460 
our speed this one I always have trouble
remember<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:21.539> I<00:00:21.570> have<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:21.840> always<00:00:21.960> look<00:00:22.199> it<00:00:22.350> up

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
remember and I have to always look it up

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.000 
remember and I have to always look it up
true<00:00:23.369> airspeed<00:00:23.609> is<00:00:24.150> your<00:00:24.600> air<00:00:24.840> speed<00:00:25.019> relative

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
true airspeed is your air speed relative

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.300 
true airspeed is your air speed relative
to<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.789> surrounding<00:00:27.420> air<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:28.470> then<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.189> next

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
to the surrounding air and then the next

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.150 
to the surrounding air and then the next
one<00:00:29.490> I<00:00:29.550> want<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.150> mention<00:00:30.330> is<00:00:31.160> calibrated

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
one I want to mention is calibrated

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.680 
one I want to mention is calibrated
airspeed<00:00:33.140> calibrated<00:00:34.140> airspeed<00:00:34.320> is

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
airspeed calibrated airspeed is

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.549 
airspeed calibrated airspeed is
indicated<00:00:36.690> airspeed<00:00:38.180> corrected<00:00:39.180> for

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
indicated airspeed corrected for

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:42.500 
indicated airspeed corrected for
installation<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.800> instrument<00:00:41.460> errors<00:00:41.850> so

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
installation and instrument errors so

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.600 
installation and instrument errors so
those<00:00:43.350> are<00:00:43.500> your<00:00:43.530> three<00:00:43.680> air<00:00:44.070> speeds<00:00:44.370> then

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
those are your three air speeds then

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.069 
those are your three air speeds then
they're<00:00:45.149> up<00:00:45.239> here<00:00:45.300> in<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.539> background<00:00:45.989> this

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
they're up here in the background this

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.840 
they're up here in the background this
is<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.289> page<00:00:46.800> from<00:00:46.950> my<00:00:47.039> notebook<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.700> thought

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
is a page from my notebook and I thought

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.060 
is a page from my notebook and I thought
it'd<00:00:47.940> be<00:00:47.969> fun<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.480> throw<00:00:49.379> up<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.559> page<00:00:49.770> of<00:00:49.920> that

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
it'd be fun to throw up a page of that

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.790 
it'd be fun to throw up a page of that
and<00:00:50.430> let's<00:00:50.640> see<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.120> original<00:00:51.930> version<00:00:52.350> the

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
and let's see the original version the

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.470 
and let's see the original version the
one<00:00:52.949> that<00:00:53.070> we<00:00:53.129> have<00:00:53.340> transcribed<00:00:54.090> in<00:00:54.329> that

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
one that we have transcribed in that

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.939 
one that we have transcribed in that
we're<00:00:54.870> getting<00:00:54.960> prepared<00:00:55.320> right<00:00:55.530> now<00:00:55.680> so

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
we're getting prepared right now so

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.350 
we're getting prepared right now so
that's<00:00:56.610> going<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.820> be<00:00:56.879> some<00:00:57.030> pretty<00:00:57.149> cool

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
that's going to be some pretty cool

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.420 
that's going to be some pretty cool
stuff<00:00:57.420> so<00:00:58.219> remember<00:00:59.219> those<00:00:59.370> three<00:00:59.579> air<00:00:59.699> speeds

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
stuff so remember those three air speeds

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.600 
stuff so remember those three air speeds
calculated<00:01:02.870> indicated<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.080> true<00:01:04.890> no<00:01:05.489> the

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
calculated indicated and true no the

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.910 
calculated indicated and true no the
difference<00:01:05.700> is<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.240> three<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.780> like<00:01:07.770> I

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
difference is to the three and like I

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.700 
difference is to the three and like I
said<00:01:07.979> very<00:01:08.460> simply<00:01:08.930> they're<00:01:09.930> not<00:01:10.110> real<00:01:10.320> real

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
said very simply they're not real real

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.410 
said very simply they're not real real
tough<00:01:10.979> but<00:01:11.280> in<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:12.060> heat<00:01:12.240> of<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.360> moment

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
tough but in the heat of the moment

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.600 
tough but in the heat of the moment
those<00:01:13.409> one<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.710> those<00:01:13.830> things<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.280> can

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
those one of those things that can

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.490 
those one of those things that can
really<00:01:14.880> trip<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.330> guy<00:01:15.509> up<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:15.869> that<00:01:16.020> simple

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
really trip a guy up is that simple

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.740
