going<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.539> talk<00:00:27.779> about<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:28.609> what<00:00:29.609> I<00:00:29.640> would

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
going to talk about is what I would

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.260 
going to talk about is what I would
classify<00:00:30.300> as<00:00:30.480> potassium<00:00:31.320> based

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270

desensitizing toothpaste now this
particular<00:00:35.870> type<00:00:36.870> of<00:00:36.899> desensitizer<00:00:37.739> is<00:00:38.370> the

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
particular type of desensitizer is the

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.549 
particular type of desensitizer is the
most<00:00:38.790> widely<00:00:39.059> available<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.809> it's<00:00:40.140> based<00:00:40.379> on

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
most widely available and it's based on

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.450 
most widely available and it's based on
the<00:00:40.829> principle<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:42.290> if<00:00:43.290> you<00:00:43.620> surround<00:00:44.070> these

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
the principle that if you surround these

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.810 
the principle that if you surround these
very<00:00:44.730> sensitive<00:00:44.969> nerves<00:00:45.660> that<00:00:45.840> are<00:00:46.820> exposed

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
exposed dentin like exposed roots if you

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.470 
exposed dentin like exposed roots if you
expose<00:00:52.620> them<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:52.890> lots<00:00:53.280> of<00:00:53.460> potassium<00:00:53.820> what

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
expose them to lots of potassium what

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.260 
expose them to lots of potassium what
ends<00:00:54.690> up<00:00:54.750> happening<00:00:54.809> is<00:00:55.350> these<00:00:55.530> nerves<00:00:55.920> are

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
ends up happening is these nerves are

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.510 
ends up happening is these nerves are
depolarized<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.600> in<00:00:58.260> time<00:00:58.530> become<00:00:59.250> less

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
depolarized and in time become less

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.599 
depolarized and in time become less
sensitive<00:01:00.289> unfortunately<00:01:01.289> although<00:01:02.100> this<00:01:02.430> is

sensitive unfortunately although this is
very<00:01:02.879> effective<00:01:04.700> oftentimes<00:01:05.700> it<00:01:05.909> takes<00:01:05.939> about

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
very effective oftentimes it takes about

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.320 
very effective oftentimes it takes about
2<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.659> 4<00:01:06.990> weeks<00:01:07.260> for<00:01:07.890> you<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.040> get<00:01:08.310> some<00:01:08.939> sort<00:01:09.240> of

in and reduce sensitivity that way and
there<00:01:48.360> are<00:01:48.479> two<00:01:48.829> basic<00:01:50.149> classes<00:01:51.149> of

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
there are two basic classes of

from them and then there's also the mi
pase<00:02:01.770> which<00:02:02.040> uses<00:02:02.490> a<00:02:02.790> milk<00:02:03.540> protein<00:02:03.829> which<00:02:04.829> is

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
pase which uses a milk protein which is

way<00:02:09.679> and<00:02:10.009> this<00:02:10.640> last<00:02:10.940> part<00:02:11.270> which<00:02:11.480> is<00:02:11.510> an

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
way and this last part which is an

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.780 
way and this last part which is an
amorphous<00:02:12.650> calcium<00:02:13.220> phosphate<00:02:14.060> and<00:02:15.790> what's

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
amorphous calcium phosphate and what's

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.550 
amorphous calcium phosphate and what's
really<00:02:17.030> great<00:02:17.300> about<00:02:17.360> these<00:02:17.690> two<00:02:17.900> faces<00:02:18.350> it

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
really great about these two faces it

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.949 
really great about these two faces it
provides<00:02:19.160> more<00:02:19.520> of<00:02:19.610> an<00:02:19.760> instantaneous<00:02:20.360> relief

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
provides more of an instantaneous relief

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.140 
provides more of an instantaneous relief
and<00:02:21.200> you<00:02:21.590> can<00:02:21.740> even<00:02:21.950> just<00:02:22.220> take<00:02:22.400> some<00:02:22.670> on<00:02:22.880> your

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
and you can even just take some on your

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.480 
and you can even just take some on your
finger<00:02:23.330> simply<00:02:24.200> and<00:02:24.410> rub<00:02:24.620> it<00:02:24.740> onto<00:02:24.890> sensitive

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
finger simply and rub it onto sensitive

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.970 
finger simply and rub it onto sensitive
areas<00:02:25.910> to<00:02:26.450> help<00:02:26.690> provide<00:02:27.290> some<00:02:27.530> relief<00:02:27.650> and

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
areas to help provide some relief and

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.490 
areas to help provide some relief and
plug<00:02:28.250> up<00:02:28.430> those<00:02:28.580> pores<00:02:28.910> in<00:02:29.150> the<00:02:29.180> meantime<00:02:29.500> but

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
plug up those pores in the meantime but

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.440 
plug up those pores in the meantime but
both<00:02:30.890> of<00:02:31.069> these<00:02:31.190> categories<00:02:31.640> are<00:02:32.090> widely

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
both of these categories are widely

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.570 
both of these categories are widely
available<00:02:32.540> and<00:02:33.110> if<00:02:33.920> you're<00:02:34.069> interested<00:02:34.489> in

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
available and if you're interested in

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.220 
available and if you're interested in
more<00:02:34.790> of<00:02:34.819> an<00:02:34.970> instantaneous<00:02:35.390> relief<00:02:35.840> which<00:02:36.020> I

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
more of an instantaneous relief which I

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.010 
more of an instantaneous relief which I
particularly<00:02:36.680> prefer<00:02:36.860> to<00:02:37.610> try<00:02:37.850> first<00:02:38.270> then<00:02:38.989> I

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
particularly prefer to try first then I

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.540 
particularly prefer to try first then I
would<00:02:39.319> go<00:02:39.410> with<00:02:39.530> these<00:02:39.709> calcium<00:02:40.160> based<00:02:40.400> these

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
would go with these calcium based these

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.460 
would go with these calcium based these
sensitizers<00:02:41.180> if<00:02:41.630> that<00:02:41.810> doesn't<00:02:42.140> work<00:02:42.230> for<00:02:42.290> you

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
sensitizers if that doesn't work for you

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.420 
sensitizers if that doesn't work for you
why<00:02:43.130> don't<00:02:43.190> you<00:02:43.340> try<00:02:44.110> the<00:02:45.110> other<00:02:45.800> class<00:02:46.130> which

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
why don't you try the other class which

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.070 
why don't you try the other class which
would<00:02:46.550> be<00:02:46.640> the<00:02:46.730> potassium<00:02:47.030> desensitize<00:02:47.900> errs

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
would be the potassium desensitize errs

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.750 
would be the potassium desensitize errs
but<00:02:48.470> it's<00:02:48.590> going<00:02:48.739> to<00:02:48.830> take<00:02:48.980> a<00:02:49.130> little<00:02:49.489> bit

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
but it's going to take a little bit

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.780 
but it's going to take a little bit
longer<00:02:50.000> so<00:02:50.360> I<00:02:51.140> hope<00:02:51.620> everyone<00:02:52.250> found<00:02:52.610> that

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
longer so I hope everyone found that

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.330 
longer so I hope everyone found that
helpful<00:02:53.180> today<00:02:53.300> and<00:02:53.660> I<00:02:54.470> hope<00:02:54.680> everyone<00:02:55.010> here
