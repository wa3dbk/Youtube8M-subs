it<00:04:50.860> this<00:04:51.370> is<00:04:51.550> the<00:04:51.939> first<00:04:52.180> time<00:04:52.360> in<00:04:52.539> a<00:04:52.629> long<00:04:52.659> time

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
it this is the first time in a long time

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.709 
it this is the first time in a long time
that<00:04:53.529> I<00:04:53.740> didn't<00:04:54.189> use<00:04:54.370> my<00:04:54.550> webcam<00:04:54.699> I<00:04:55.180> figured

that I didn't use my webcam I figured

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:57.360 
that I didn't use my webcam I figured
that<00:04:55.870> it<00:04:56.020> would<00:04:56.139> be<00:04:56.319> better<00:04:56.469> to<00:04:56.650> not<00:04:56.949> use<00:04:57.189> the

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
that it would be better to not use the

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.369 
that it would be better to not use the
webcam<00:04:57.580> because<00:04:58.000> it's<00:04:58.150> so<00:04:58.360> atmospheric<00:04:58.509> and

00:04:59.369 --> 00:04:59.379 
webcam because it's so atmospheric and

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:01.469 
webcam because it's so atmospheric and
not<00:04:59.740> a<00:04:59.770> lot<00:04:59.949> of<00:05:00.009> stuff<00:05:00.340> happens<00:05:00.729> I<00:05:00.939> did<00:05:01.090> record

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:01.479 
not a lot of stuff happens I did record

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:03.659 
not a lot of stuff happens I did record
my<00:05:01.719> webcam<00:05:02.139> and<00:05:02.379> so<00:05:02.800> there<00:05:02.979> were<00:05:03.310> a<00:05:03.340> few

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:03.669 
my webcam and so there were a few

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:05.820 
my webcam and so there were a few
moments<00:05:03.849> that<00:05:04.300> I<00:05:04.330> used<00:05:04.659> it<00:05:04.870> without<00:05:05.289> my<00:05:05.620> light

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
moments that I used it without my light

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.800 
moments that I used it without my light
I<00:05:06.099> am<00:05:06.370> using<00:05:06.669> my<00:05:06.789> life<00:05:07.000> right<00:05:07.270> now<00:05:07.300> just

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
but usually I did not use my light to

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.360 
but usually I did not use my light to
immerse<00:05:13.810> myself<00:05:14.020> a<00:05:14.349> little<00:05:14.439> bit<00:05:14.740> more<00:05:14.979> in<00:05:15.189> the
