00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
the desktop desktop choose it was

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.020 
the desktop desktop choose it was
already<00:03:22.410> there<00:03:22.530> or<00:03:22.680> whatever<00:03:22.799> and<00:03:23.730> then<00:03:23.910> you

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
already there or whatever and then you

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.350 
already there or whatever and then you
just<00:03:24.150> click<00:03:24.269> start<00:03:24.630> and<00:03:25.790> depending<00:03:26.790> on<00:03:26.940> how

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
just click start and depending on how

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.870 
just click start and depending on how
big<00:03:27.600> the<00:03:27.630> file<00:03:28.049> is<00:03:28.350> in<00:03:29.220> might<00:03:29.489> take<00:03:29.700> a<00:03:29.730> little

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
big the file is in might take a little

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.870 
big the file is in might take a little
while<00:03:30.110> but<00:03:31.130> it<00:03:32.130> shouldn't<00:03:32.489> take<00:03:32.549> too<00:03:32.700> long

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
while but it shouldn't take too long

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.610 
while but it shouldn't take too long
because<00:03:33.269> it's<00:03:33.600> not<00:03:33.840> like<00:03:34.110> it's<00:03:34.410> not<00:03:34.590> a

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
because it's not like it's not a

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.800 
because it's not like it's not a
gigabyte<00:03:35.070> movie<00:03:35.459> so<00:03:35.730> it<00:03:36.420> won't<00:03:36.600> take<00:03:36.780> very

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
gigabyte movie so it won't take very

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.300 
gigabyte movie so it won't take very
long

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.790 

so<00:03:41.940> transformers<00:03:42.750> is<00:03:42.989> a<00:03:43.020> pretty<00:03:43.290> long<00:03:43.500> movie

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
so transformers is a pretty long movie

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.680 
so transformers is a pretty long movie
soon<00:03:44.190> it<00:03:44.910> looks<00:03:45.060> like<00:03:45.150> it's<00:03:45.330> gonna<00:03:45.420> take<00:03:45.660> a

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
soon it looks like it's gonna take a

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.940 
soon it looks like it's gonna take a
little<00:03:45.810> off<00:03:46.400> anyways<00:03:47.400> um<00:03:47.720> so<00:03:48.720> I<00:03:49.260> already<00:03:49.620> did
