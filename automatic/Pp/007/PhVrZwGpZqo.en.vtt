is<00:00:46.840> very<00:00:47.080> simple<00:00:47.320> if<00:00:48.600> you<00:00:49.600> are<00:00:49.930> u<00:00:50.860> prime<00:00:51.190> R

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:51.490 
is very simple if you are u prime R

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:55.979 
is very simple if you are u prime R
prime<00:00:51.820> F<00:00:52.060> prime<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:53.710> that<00:00:53.980> brings<00:00:54.700> me<00:00:54.940> to<00:00:55.660> a

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
prime F prime and that brings me to a

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.770 
prime F prime and that brings me to a
shape<00:00:56.320> on<00:00:56.560> the<00:00:56.860> top<00:00:57.190> face<00:00:57.430> you<00:00:58.420> don't<00:00:58.450> have<00:00:58.660> to

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
shape on the top face you don't have to

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.060 
shape on the top face you don't have to
line<00:00:58.930> up<00:00:59.050> that<00:00:59.200> corner<00:00:59.380> piece<00:00:59.680> but<00:01:00.010> I<00:01:00.220> did<00:01:00.989> this

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
line up that corner piece but I did this

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.039 
line up that corner piece but I did this
although<00:01:03.070> it<00:01:03.190> may<00:01:03.310> not<00:01:03.460> be<00:01:03.839> recognizable<00:01:04.839> is

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049 
although it may not be recognizable is

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:10.530 
although it may not be recognizable is
the<00:01:05.860> soon<00:01:07.470> for<00:01:08.470> the<00:01:08.650> soon<00:01:09.150> you<00:01:10.150> can<00:01:10.330> tell

the soon for the soon you can tell

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.300 
the soon for the soon you can tell
because<00:01:10.659> you<00:01:10.960> have<00:01:11.170> only<00:01:11.380> one<00:01:11.530> corner<00:01:12.159> piece

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
because you have only one corner piece

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.300 
because you have only one corner piece
flat<00:01:12.700> and<00:01:13.060> a<00:01:13.870> little<00:01:14.170> tip<00:01:14.380> when<00:01:14.950> you're<00:01:14.979> done

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
of these pieces flat so how you know

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.789 
of these pieces flat so how you know
which<00:01:28.030> way<00:01:28.180> to<00:01:28.240> start<00:01:28.479> with<00:01:28.600> the<00:01:28.720> soon<00:01:28.960> is<00:01:29.200> if

which way to start with the soon is if

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:32.940 
which way to start with the soon is if
it's<00:01:30.100> anti<00:01:30.490> soon<00:01:30.729> or<00:01:30.909> soon<00:01:31.180> in<00:01:32.170> my<00:01:32.590> case<00:01:32.650> on

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
it's anti soon or soon in my case on

here I have a regular soon and ty soon

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.800 
here I have a regular soon and ty soon
see<00:01:36.580> those<00:01:36.729> three<00:01:37.000> corner<00:01:37.360> pieces<00:01:37.570> they're

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
see those three corner pieces they're

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.289 
see those three corner pieces they're
anti<00:01:38.260> soon<00:01:38.500> would<00:01:38.860> be<00:01:39.130> where<00:01:39.760> they're<00:01:39.880> on<00:01:40.090> the

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 
anti soon would be where they're on the

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:44.340 
anti soon would be where they're on the
left<00:01:40.540> so<00:01:41.530> I<00:01:41.890> have<00:01:42.369> an<00:01:42.670> anti<00:01:43.240> soon<00:01:43.540> and<00:01:43.810> how<00:01:44.320> I

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
left so I have an anti soon and how I

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.399 
left so I have an anti soon and how I
can<00:01:44.590> tell<00:01:44.860> is<00:01:45.070> when<00:01:45.130> I<00:01:45.940> lift<00:01:46.299> this<00:01:46.600> side<00:01:47.200> to

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
can tell is when I lift this side to

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:49.230 
can tell is when I lift this side to
start<00:01:47.740> the<00:01:47.890> algorithm<00:01:48.430> the<00:01:48.549> zune<00:01:48.790> algorithm

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240

have on here what I have on here is the

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:40.710 
have on here what I have on here is the
equivalent<00:03:39.370> now<00:03:39.759> of<00:03:39.790> what<00:03:40.090> I<00:03:40.120> have<00:03:40.299> on<00:03:40.329> here<00:03:40.659> is

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
equivalent now of what I have on here is

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.280 
equivalent now of what I have on here is
one<00:03:41.019> solid<00:03:41.259> side<00:03:41.680> and<00:03:42.040> then<00:03:42.819> these<00:03:43.689> edges<00:03:44.109> need

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
one solid side and then these edges need

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.580 
one solid side and then these edges need
to<00:03:44.409> be<00:03:44.500> moved<00:03:44.739> over<00:03:45.989> that<00:03:46.989> one<00:03:47.169> needs<00:03:47.379> to<00:03:47.470> go

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
to be moved over that one needs to go

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.439 
to be moved over that one needs to go
here<00:03:48.009> this<00:03:48.280> one<00:03:48.489> needs<00:03:48.609> to<00:03:48.729> go<00:03:48.909> over<00:03:49.000> there<00:03:49.180> and

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:49.449 
here this one needs to go over there and

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:50.789 
here this one needs to go over there and
that<00:03:49.659> will<00:03:49.780> need<00:03:49.900> to<00:03:49.959> score<00:03:50.109> it<00:03:50.199> there<00:03:50.349> that's

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
that will need to score it there that's

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:53.879 
that will need to score it there that's
called<00:03:51.009> a<00:03:51.099> three<00:03:51.430> edge<00:03:51.639> cycle<00:03:52.389> and<00:03:52.680> this<00:03:53.680> is

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:53.889 
called a three edge cycle and this is

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:57.059 
called a three edge cycle and this is
the<00:03:54.129> solid<00:03:54.370> face<00:03:54.689> same<00:03:55.689> is<00:03:55.810> right<00:03:55.930> here<00:03:56.199> so

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069 
the solid face same is right here so

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:59.249 
the solid face same is right here so
what<00:03:57.220> I'm<00:03:57.310> going<00:03:57.430> to<00:03:57.489> do<00:03:57.699> is<00:03:57.939> hold<00:03:58.750> the<00:03:58.870> solid

00:03:59.249 --> 00:03:59.259 
what I'm going to do is hold the solid

00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:02.909 
what I'm going to do is hold the solid
side<00:03:59.469> in<00:03:59.620> my<00:03:59.709> right<00:03:59.949> hand<00:04:00.340> and<00:04:01.379> move<00:04:02.379> the<00:04:02.709> side

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:02.919 
side in my right hand and move the side

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:05.159 
side in my right hand and move the side
opposite<00:04:03.489> of<00:04:03.639> the<00:04:03.759> solid<00:04:04.030> phase<00:04:04.180> two<00:04:04.900> times

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:05.169 
opposite of the solid phase two times

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:08.039 
opposite of the solid phase two times
and<00:04:05.530> then<00:04:06.459> I'm<00:04:06.759> going<00:04:07.000> to<00:04:07.030> look<00:04:07.359> at<00:04:07.599> the<00:04:07.840> side

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
and then I'm going to look at the side

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:10.559 
and then I'm going to look at the side
opposite<00:04:08.530> the<00:04:08.590> solid<00:04:08.919> phase<00:04:09.099> and<00:04:09.459> I'm<00:04:10.389> going

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
opposite the solid phase and I'm going

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:13.259 
opposite the solid phase and I'm going
to<00:04:10.599> see<00:04:10.930> since<00:04:11.530> this<00:04:11.889> edge<00:04:12.310> piece<00:04:12.819> needs<00:04:13.060> to<00:04:13.180> go

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
to see since this edge piece needs to go

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:16.050 
to see since this edge piece needs to go
there<00:04:13.750> we're<00:04:14.349> going<00:04:14.469> to<00:04:14.530> move<00:04:14.739> it<00:04:14.889> there<00:04:15.099> then

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
there we're going to move it there then

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.370 
there we're going to move it there then
I'm<00:04:16.209> going<00:04:16.959> to<00:04:17.019> bring<00:04:17.199> both<00:04:17.469> sides<00:04:17.829> down<00:04:19.229> do<00:04:20.229> an

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
I'm going to bring both sides down do an

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.649 
I'm going to bring both sides down do an
f2<00:04:20.919> and<00:04:22.050> bring<00:04:23.050> both<00:04:23.259> of<00:04:23.500> the<00:04:23.620> sides<00:04:23.770> back<00:04:24.219> up

00:04:24.649 --> 00:04:24.659 
f2 and bring both of the sides back up

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:27.620 
f2 and bring both of the sides back up
line<00:04:25.659> up<00:04:25.690> this<00:04:25.960> one<00:04:26.139> that's<00:04:26.320> sticking<00:04:26.590> out

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
line up this one that's sticking out

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.630 
line up this one that's sticking out
and<00:04:28.940> then<00:04:29.940> my<00:04:30.330> mirror<00:04:30.600> cube<00:04:30.900> is<00:04:30.990> solved<00:04:31.640> same

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
and then my mirror cube is solved same

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.120 
and then my mirror cube is solved same
thing<00:04:32.850> here<00:04:33.140> side<00:04:34.140> opposite<00:04:34.680> the<00:04:34.740> solid<00:04:35.040> phase

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
thing here side opposite the solid phase

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.740 
thing here side opposite the solid phase
2<00:04:35.340> times<00:04:35.610> the<00:04:35.910> piece<00:04:36.690> needs<00:04:36.930> to<00:04:37.020> go<00:04:37.110> there<00:04:37.370> down

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
2 times the piece needs to go there down

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:44.510 
2 times the piece needs to go there down
and<00:04:39.750> up<00:04:42.140> if<00:04:43.140> you<00:04:43.260> don't<00:04:43.560> have<00:04:43.860> a<00:04:43.890> solid<00:04:44.190> side

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
and up if you don't have a solid side

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.430 
and up if you don't have a solid side
for<00:04:44.820> example<00:04:45.210> your<00:04:45.420> cube<00:04:45.690> looks<00:04:45.810> like<00:04:46.050> this

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
for example your cube looks like this

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.310 
for example your cube looks like this
where<00:04:47.040> all<00:04:47.340> the<00:04:47.550> corners<00:04:48.000> are<00:04:48.150> lined<00:04:48.420> up<00:04:48.570> but

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
where all the corners are lined up but

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.770 
where all the corners are lined up but
none<00:04:49.590> of<00:04:49.620> the<00:04:49.770> faces<00:04:50.160> are<00:04:50.280> totally<00:04:50.700> flat<00:04:51.030> on

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
none of the faces are totally flat on

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.630 
none of the faces are totally flat on
the<00:04:51.900> sides<00:04:52.140> then<00:04:53.070> you're<00:04:53.220> going<00:04:53.310> to<00:04:53.370> do<00:04:53.520> that

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640 
the sides then you're going to do that

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.700 
the sides then you're going to do that
same<00:04:53.700> thing<00:04:54.270> again<00:04:54.780> as<00:04:55.020> if<00:04:55.200> you<00:04:55.320> did<00:04:55.500> have<00:04:55.680> a

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
same thing again as if you did have a

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.960 
same thing again as if you did have a
solid<00:04:55.980> side<00:04:57.560> same<00:04:58.560> thing<00:04:58.590> in<00:04:59.100> the<00:04:59.340> set<00:04:59.580> before

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
solid side same thing in the set before

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:01.700 
solid side same thing in the set before
where<00:05:00.240> if<00:05:00.330> you<00:05:00.480> do<00:05:00.660> it<00:05:00.780> where<00:05:01.140> if<00:05:01.260> you<00:05:01.350> didn't

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
where if you do it where if you didn't

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.340 
where if you do it where if you didn't
have<00:05:01.800> two<00:05:02.040> corners<00:05:02.490> lined<00:05:03.420> up<00:05:03.630> you're<00:05:04.200> going

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
have two corners lined up you're going

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.370 
have two corners lined up you're going
to<00:05:04.440> do<00:05:04.590> that<00:05:04.770> algorithm<00:05:05.070> and<00:05:06.140> we'll<00:05:07.140> give<00:05:07.260> you

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
to do that algorithm and we'll give you

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.730 
to do that algorithm and we'll give you
a<00:05:07.410> salt<00:05:07.650> face<00:05:07.970> and<00:05:08.970> go<00:05:09.750> ahead<00:05:09.990> and<00:05:10.260> finish<00:05:10.530> the

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
a salt face and go ahead and finish the

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.930 
a salt face and go ahead and finish the
cute<00:05:12.290> so<00:05:13.290> that's<00:05:13.380> basically<00:05:13.590> it<00:05:13.890> for<00:05:14.220> solving

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
cute so that's basically it for solving

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.110 
cute so that's basically it for solving
the<00:05:15.030> mirror<00:05:15.360> cube<00:05:15.630> like<00:05:16.110> I<00:05:16.230> said<00:05:16.530> it's<00:05:17.120> the

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
the mirror cube like I said it's the

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.090 
the mirror cube like I said it's the
very<00:05:18.630> similar<00:05:19.020> to<00:05:19.080> the<00:05:19.170> Rubik's<00:05:19.560> Cube<00:05:19.860> it

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
very similar to the Rubik's Cube it

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.790 
very similar to the Rubik's Cube it
basically<00:05:20.580> is<00:05:21.060> one<00:05:21.450> but<00:05:21.720> you<00:05:21.870> go<00:05:22.020> by<00:05:22.260> shape

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
basically is one but you go by shape

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.250 
basically is one but you go by shape
instead<00:05:23.250> of<00:05:23.460> color<00:05:23.730> so<00:05:24.690> you<00:05:24.780> shouldn't<00:05:25.110> really

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:25.260 
instead of color so you shouldn't really

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:26.930 
instead of color so you shouldn't really
have<00:05:25.530> a<00:05:25.560> problem<00:05:25.830> solving<00:05:26.340> it<00:05:26.490> if<00:05:26.670> you<00:05:26.790> can

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
have a problem solving it if you can

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.970 
have a problem solving it if you can
solve<00:05:27.120> a<00:05:27.300> regular<00:05:27.660> one<00:05:27.840> but<00:05:28.440> in<00:05:28.560> case<00:05:28.710> you<00:05:28.740> had

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:28.980 
solve a regular one but in case you had

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:31.820 
solve a regular one but in case you had
questions<00:05:29.670> or<00:05:30.060> things<00:05:30.510> like<00:05:30.660> that<00:05:30.780> that's<00:05:31.680> why

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
questions or things like that that's why

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.250 
questions or things like that that's why
