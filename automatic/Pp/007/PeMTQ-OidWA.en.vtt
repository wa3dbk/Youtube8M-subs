thigh and just repeat the process at

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.979 
thigh and just repeat the process at
that<00:01:00.739> point<00:01:01.039> will<00:01:01.219> basically<00:01:01.730> have<00:01:01.940> your<00:01:02.239> arm

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
that point will basically have your arm

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.950

stroke<00:01:03.500> for<00:01:04.039> the<00:01:04.070> backstroke<00:01:04.670> another<00:01:05.660> point

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
stroke for the backstroke another point

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.920 
stroke for the backstroke another point
to<00:01:06.110> note<00:01:06.140> is<00:01:06.470> to<00:01:06.800> rotate<00:01:07.100> your<00:01:07.399> shoulders<00:01:07.930> so

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
to note is to rotate your shoulders so

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.300 
to note is to rotate your shoulders so
basically<00:01:09.350> your<00:01:09.560> shoulder<00:01:09.860> touches<00:01:10.190> your

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
basically your shoulder touches your

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.400 
basically your shoulder touches your
chin<00:01:10.580> with<00:01:10.729> each<00:01:10.910> stroke<00:01:11.300> this<00:01:12.020> will<00:01:12.200> help

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.410 
chin with each stroke this will help

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:13.809 
chin with each stroke this will help
with<00:01:12.590> the<00:01:12.649> hydrodynamics<00:01:12.979> in<00:01:13.550> your<00:01:13.670> body

00:01:13.809 --> 00:01:13.819 
with the hydrodynamics in your body

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:15.520 
with the hydrodynamics in your body
flowing<00:01:14.240> through<00:01:14.420> the<00:01:14.479> water<00:01:14.690> and<00:01:14.990> will<00:01:15.380> also

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
flowing through the water and will also

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.350 
flowing through the water and will also
help<00:01:15.800> prevent<00:01:16.100> any<00:01:16.310> sort<00:01:16.490> of<00:01:16.580> injuries<00:01:17.090> to

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
help prevent any sort of injuries to

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.210 
help prevent any sort of injuries to
your<00:01:17.450> shoulders<00:01:17.840> as<00:01:18.140> you're<00:01:18.709> working<00:01:19.009> on<00:01:19.100> the

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
your shoulders as you're working on the

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.510 
your shoulders as you're working on the
backstroke<00:01:19.899> the<00:01:20.899> next<00:01:21.229> step<00:01:21.410> is<00:01:21.920> basically<00:01:22.130> to

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
backstroke the next step is basically to

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.910 
backstroke the next step is basically to
practice<00:01:22.880> your<00:01:23.030> kick<00:01:23.289> the<00:01:24.289> best<00:01:24.500> way<00:01:24.649> to<00:01:24.679> do

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
practice your kick the best way to do

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.059 
practice your kick the best way to do
this<00:01:25.099> is<00:01:25.399> to<00:01:25.670> perhaps<00:01:25.970> lean<00:01:26.360> on<00:01:26.509> the<00:01:26.599> stairs

00:01:27.059 --> 00:01:27.069 
this is to perhaps lean on the stairs

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:29.260 
this is to perhaps lean on the stairs
put<00:01:28.069> your<00:01:28.220> legs<00:01:28.399> out<00:01:28.550> in<00:01:28.700> front<00:01:28.729> of<00:01:28.970> you<00:01:29.060> and

00:01:31.059 --> 00:01:31.069 
practice that same flutter kick that you

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:33.430 
practice that same flutter kick that you

bend to the knees just enough to kind of

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.020 
bend to the knees just enough to kind of
feel<00:01:38.869> flexible<00:01:39.440> but<00:01:40.039> not<00:01:40.220> a<00:01:40.250> lot<00:01:40.550> as<00:01:40.729> to<00:01:40.880> where
