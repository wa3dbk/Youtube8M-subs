somebody looks like when being hit with
a<00:04:04.900> flamethrower<00:04:05.200> but<00:04:05.650> in<00:04:05.740> this<00:04:05.890> game<00:04:06.130> it's<00:04:06.640> a

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
a flamethrower but in this game it's a

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:18.569 
a flamethrower but in this game it's a
lot<00:04:06.970> of<00:04:07.000> fun

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.949 

as<00:04:19.579> you<00:04:19.700> can<00:04:19.760> see<00:04:19.940> on<00:04:20.060> screen<00:04:20.180> here<00:04:20.600> one<00:04:20.780> thing

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
as you can see on screen here one thing

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:22.540 
as you can see on screen here one thing
that<00:04:21.110> really<00:04:21.440> jumped<00:04:21.769> out<00:04:21.860> at<00:04:22.040> me<00:04:22.070> was<00:04:22.400> the

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
that really jumped out at me was the

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.100 
that really jumped out at me was the
camera<00:04:23.000> lens<00:04:23.210> focal<00:04:23.930> length<00:04:23.960> effects<00:04:26.110> things

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
camera lens focal length effects things

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.450 
camera lens focal length effects things
are<00:04:27.320> constantly<00:04:27.770> moving<00:04:27.950> in<00:04:28.190> and<00:04:28.370> out<00:04:28.400> of

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
focus depending on it through zoomed in

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.600 
focus depending on it through zoomed in
where<00:04:30.320> they<00:04:30.470> are<00:04:30.650> in<00:04:30.770> relation<00:04:31.190> to<00:04:31.220> you<00:04:33.610> here

where they are in relation to you here

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.100 
where they are in relation to you here
in<00:04:34.670> the<00:04:34.760> Xbox<00:04:35.210> with<00:04:35.390> the<00:04:35.480> left<00:04:35.690> trigger<00:04:35.900> you

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
in the Xbox with the left trigger you

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.480 
in the Xbox with the left trigger you
zoom<00:04:36.320> in<00:04:36.470> on<00:04:36.500> things<00:04:36.800> in<00:04:37.040> the<00:04:37.070> right<00:04:37.220> trigger

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
zoom in on things in the right trigger

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.460 
zoom in on things in the right trigger
you<00:04:37.730> fire<00:04:38.030> when<00:04:38.270> you<00:04:38.390> pull<00:04:38.600> back<00:04:38.810> from<00:04:38.990> zooming

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
you fire when you pull back from zooming

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.410 
you fire when you pull back from zooming
it<00:04:39.620> seamlessly<00:04:40.160> changes<00:04:40.610> focal<00:04:40.970> length<00:04:41.150> so<00:04:41.360> it

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:41.420 
it seamlessly changes focal length so it

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:49.150 
it seamlessly changes focal length so it
looks<00:04:41.630> very<00:04:41.690> nice<00:04:47.560> similar<00:04:48.560> to<00:04:48.710> what<00:04:48.860> they<00:04:49.010> use

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
looks very nice similar to what they use

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.790 
looks very nice similar to what they use
in<00:04:49.340> films<00:04:49.610> like<00:04:49.640> Black<00:04:49.940> Hawk<00:04:50.210> Down<00:04:50.480> and<00:04:50.800> Saving

Private Ryan the camera work in the game

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.590 
Private Ryan the camera work in the game
has<00:04:54.020> a<00:04:54.050> very<00:04:54.140> handheld<00:04:54.980> jerky<00:04:55.940> feel<00:04:56.240> to<00:04:56.480> it
