00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:07.870
 welcome to this space my name is 

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:10.870
 Luis Alfonso Dominguez I am a teacher 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:13.089
 graduated from the university tomógrafo I am 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.919
 retired professor from the department of 

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:17.260
 physics of the sound university and 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:19.570
 I am currently carrying out a 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.480
 project that is called challenging the 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:25.300
 human mind is a project in which 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:28.510
 we bring to the communities experiments 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:31.450
 scientists we carry everything 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:34.750
 what can one do to make the mind 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:35.830
 human development is a challenge to the 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.990
 human mind 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.090
 we are talking about puzzle 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:43.350
 wire wood experiments 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:45.730
 scientific optical illusions movies 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.480
 related to the development of 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:52.570
 mind today in this program I am going to 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:56.380
 present an experiment 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:59.380
 and it involves some properties some 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:01.000
 physical laws that in some way in the 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.700
 we've seen it but we're going to 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 do with materials 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:09.640
 home that we can locate a container 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.600
 how are we seeing this 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.390
 container 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.940
 is a 2 liter container can be a 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.570
 liter and a half can not be smaller 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:22.450
 matter the idea is to do an experiment 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:25.150
 to teach us some physics here 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:28.900
 I will also use I'm 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:30.700
 using a soft drink container 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.860
 plastic that is transparent you 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.110
 we remove it here you can see that still 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.650
 part of what we have also removed 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:41.080
 let's use when we go there are some 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.990
 high that are packaged true 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:48.640
 let's start precisely this and the 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:51.130
 idea is to introduce these these little balls 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.780
 that have sauce and we introduce it 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.340
 in 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.039
 here we can see 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:01.219
 this is not the process but what 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:03.020
 we did we had water and 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:05.569
 we introduce we doubled a 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.819
 little truth the sachet these can be 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:11.900
 see yes I hope you do not see the mark 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:13.540
 but let's introduce it and already this 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.700
 we would be seeing what I would be observing 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:21.230
 these same ones I can see here in this 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:23.120
 glass you see that you can grab a 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.970
 bag to test if it 's going to serve me 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:29.510
 or it will not serve me, I can not put 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:32.360
 another if in some cases it may be that 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:36.069
 the bag floats a little more or floats a 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:39.319
 little less I would like to take advantage here 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:42.140
 to see this phenomenon actually 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:44.930
 that we have is a bag that contains yes 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.900
 a liquid that can be the liquid of 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.599
 a sauce 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.360
 and in that case jalapeño peppers in this 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:56.170
 Tomato case that the normal thing that we have 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:59.409
 within that apart from this it is the 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:02.439
 liquid there is air if then we would have 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:05.650
 a bag with air then this done 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:08.560
 that the air that is contained goes to 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:11.680
 cause that in the liquid without that 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:15.519
 have we have a volume and 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:18.069
 displaced if in this case this volume 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:20.769
 we have us do just 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:23.889
 let the body float if we 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:26.139
 we had for example a stone if the 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:26.950
 density of the stone that we would have 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:29.560
 we 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:32.079
 truth makes the stone go towards 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.049
 down however we have cases like the 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:38.859
 wood true the wood in which this one 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:40.470
 fleet and it is by its lower density another 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:43.120
 way to make bodies float 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.889
 you know for example how it works 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.530
 a boat a boat that we 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:50.620
 we had are made in materials of 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.020
 iron but what we do is 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:56.890
 make a pretty volume 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:59.620
 big so that that volume evicted 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:02.200
 this evicted volume produces a 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.240
 force that is called thrust force or 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.090
 force right here actually what 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:09.550
 we have here is the strength of 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:12.670
 push the pushing force depends on the 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:16.120
 volume dislodged within the liquid the 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:19.030
 volume that would be occupying the object 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.440
 inside the liquid this would be the 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.480
 evicted volume 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.910
 the greater the volume evicted 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:27.520
 greater is the strength if I for example 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:31.480
 I'm seeing here in this case that the 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:33.310
 object is in balance is because the 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.270
 pushing force that is directed towards 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.630
 above 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.700
 and the weight of the liquid that we have 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:43.540
 us that deviated down are 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:46.150
 of equal magnitude in the event that the 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:48.100
 amount of fluid the weight is out 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.440
 greater than in the pushing force 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.569
 then the object would have to go 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.800
 down 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:57.669
 we are going to do this experiment 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:01.610
 taking it as I said here in the 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:07.620
 bottle nothing else this we already introduce it 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:10.590
 one what you can do to put 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.780
 and make the object fall towards 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:15.900
 below what we have to do is 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:18.419
 decrease the volume remember that the 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.580
 pushing force between the larger the 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:22.320
 volume the pushing force that is 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.270
 directed upwards is greater 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.400
 I want that I have to do I have 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.979
 to make this decrease its volume 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:32.220
 how can I decrease its volume I by 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:34.500
 example I can exert pressure with 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.100
 my hands for example here if you exercise a 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.949
 Pressure 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:40.050
 the volume will decrease there, remember 

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:43.919
 that also has air and then the 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:45.750
 air is understandable true he 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:47.550
 can compress the air very easily 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:49.740
 more than a liquid 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:52.080
 then inside the sachet 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.820
 that has air if I have cheese pressure 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.970
 then the volume that I would have 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:59.789
 diminishes one way of doing it would be in 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:02.500
 the bottle in the bottle if I exercise 

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:04.810
 pressure on one of the sides 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:07.270
 and me is that his pressure on some 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:09.400
 sides this pressure by the principle of 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:13.360
 pascal that is also present here is 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:14.980
 transmits equally to all yes to all the 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.050
 liquid that is inside the bottle 

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:19.450
 for example if I press here the 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:21.130
 pressure is transmitted to all points 

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:23.800
 of the bottle but in particular about 

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:26.710
 the little bag is to say that instead of me 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.660
 is pressing with the hand the 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:31.600
 little bag of this what I'm doing 

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:33.340
 here when I speak and this here with the 

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:36.940
 same liquid I'm exercising a 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:40.660
 pressure and then I can do true 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:43.390
 I can make the volume decrease 

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:46.390
 then the pushing force is lower and 

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:49.180
 I can make the object go down 

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:51.850
 down yes because that's what it was 

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:54.940
 happening what I am causing is 

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:56.860
 compress the air decreased the volume 

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:58.380
 by decreasing the volume the force of 

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:01.810
 push that is directed upwards 

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:04.180
 decreases and then the weight of the liquid 

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:06.100
 to do his own work that is to go 

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:08.740
 down not if you can see it 

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:10.509
 I'm really going to press here 

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:14.120
 at the moment it is pressing I am 

00:07:10.509 --> 00:07:17.150
 exercising the pascal principle 

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:19.430
 and logically I can do true here 

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:23.080
 I am exerting a pressure I can do 

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:25.520
 that this goes down or goes up to my will 

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:28.340
 using the principles of physics 

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:30.290
 what principles are I using I'm 

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:32.930
 using the with flexibility of the 

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:35.479
 gases that in this case is the air that 

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:38.389
 we have content within this 

00:07:35.479 --> 00:07:41.660
 little bag and apart from that we have the 

00:07:38.389 --> 00:07:44.419
 push force true and also 

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:46.250
 we have the principle of 

00:07:44.419 --> 00:07:48.409
 archimedes that is related to the 

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:50.739
 pushing force 

00:07:48.409 --> 00:07:55.239
 then thank you very much and we are waiting for you 

00:07:50.739 --> 00:07:55.239
 to present you with new experiments
