00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
get a little tingly and so if you know

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.830 
get a little tingly and so if you know
your<00:00:37.350> Anatomy<00:00:37.829> you<00:00:38.700> start<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.480> think<00:00:39.719> well

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
your Anatomy you start to think well

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.270 
your Anatomy you start to think well
that<00:00:39.899> sounds<00:00:40.320> like<00:00:40.410> kind<00:00:40.680> of<00:00:40.770> like<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:41.040> nerve

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
that sounds like kind of like a nerve

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.619 
that sounds like kind of like a nerve
issue<00:00:41.550> so<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.780> problem<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:43.469> in<00:00:44.340> my<00:00:44.520> hand<00:00:44.850> you

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
issue so the problem is in my hand you

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.869 
issue so the problem is in my hand you
know<00:00:45.750> that<00:00:45.989> what's<00:00:46.410> showing<00:00:46.770> up<00:00:46.920> is<00:00:47.129> my<00:00:47.550> hand

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
know that what's showing up is my hand

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.310 
know that what's showing up is my hand
is<00:00:48.059> in<00:00:48.180> this<00:00:48.300> event<00:00:48.510> it's<00:00:48.690> much<00:00:48.870> weaker<00:00:49.110> than

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
is in this event it's much weaker than

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.470 
is in this event it's much weaker than
my<00:00:49.649> left<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.070> it's<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.370> complication<00:00:50.910> really

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
my left and it's a complication really

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.910 
my left and it's a complication really
all<00:00:51.629> this<00:00:51.780> started<00:00:52.140> back<00:00:52.320> in<00:00:52.379> fourth<00:00:52.739> grade

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
all this started back in fourth grade

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.040 
all this started back in fourth grade
when<00:00:53.160> I<00:00:53.219> fell<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:53.760> took<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.750> head<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:54.989> the

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
when I fell and took the head of the

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.209 
when I fell and took the head of the
radius<00:00:55.559> off<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.250> so<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.899> issue<00:00:58.109> actually<00:00:58.649> is

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
radius off and so the issue actually is

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.510 
radius off and so the issue actually is
not<00:00:59.399> my<00:01:00.120> hand<00:01:00.449> though<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.680> source<00:01:01.949> is<00:01:02.190> not<00:01:02.309> my

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
not my hand though the source is not my

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.280 
not my hand though the source is not my
hand<00:01:02.850> it's<00:01:03.210> I've<00:01:03.390> been<00:01:03.539> here<00:01:03.750> with<00:01:03.899> my<00:01:04.080> owner

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
hand it's I've been here with my owner

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.260 
hand it's I've been here with my owner
nerve<00:01:04.769> there's<00:01:05.100> something<00:01:05.489> going<00:01:05.760> on<00:01:05.880> in<00:01:06.150> the

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
nerve there's something going on in the

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.899 
nerve there's something going on in the
elbow<00:01:06.630> here<00:01:06.900> probably<00:01:07.260> some<00:01:08.040> arthritis<00:01:08.220> is

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
elbow here probably some arthritis is

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.600 
elbow here probably some arthritis is
the<00:01:09.030> best<00:01:09.240> guess<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:10.080> is<00:01:10.439> keeping<00:01:11.100> it<00:01:11.280> from

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
the best guess that is keeping it from

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.609 
the best guess that is keeping it from
functioning<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.299> it's<00:01:12.540> deteriorating<00:01:13.350> here

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
functioning and it's deteriorating here

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.740 
functioning and it's deteriorating here
but<00:01:13.799> it<00:01:13.920> shows<00:01:14.159> up<00:01:14.400> here<00:01:14.760> so<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.420> performance

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
but it shows up here so the performance

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.140 
but it shows up here so the performance
principle<00:01:16.439> is<00:01:16.619> always<00:01:17.340> look<00:01:17.520> for<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.850> source

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
principle is always look for the source

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.630 
principle is always look for the source
if<00:01:18.600> I<00:01:18.750> was<00:01:19.380> going<00:01:19.590> in<00:01:19.680> for<00:01:19.710> hand<00:01:20.070> surgery<00:01:20.310> which

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
if I was going in for hand surgery which

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.130 
if I was going in for hand surgery which
on<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.880> one<00:01:21.030> hand<00:01:21.210> would<00:01:21.360> make<00:01:21.540> sensipsych

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
on the one hand would make sensipsych

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.230 
on the one hand would make sensipsych
I've<00:01:22.320> got<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.530> problem<00:01:22.770> with<00:01:22.920> my<00:01:23.159> hand<00:01:23.430> but

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240

elbow<00:01:26.280> surgery<00:01:26.549> because<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.270> source<00:01:27.540> of<00:01:27.780> it

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
elbow surgery because the source of it

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.170 
elbow surgery because the source of it
is<00:01:28.229> up<00:01:28.829> here<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.430> I'm<00:01:29.549> looking<00:01:29.729> with<00:01:30.060> the

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
ball or popping up or over over swinging

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.210 
ball or popping up or over over swinging
somehow<00:01:51.210> whatever<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.750> symptom<00:01:52.140> is<00:01:52.290> try<00:01:53.159> and

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
somehow whatever the symptom is try and

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.030 
somehow whatever the symptom is try and
look<00:01:53.399> at<00:01:53.549> least<00:01:53.790> one<00:01:54.299> layer<00:01:54.829> deeper<00:01:55.829> it's<00:01:55.920> like

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
look at least one layer deeper it's like

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.330 
look at least one layer deeper it's like
why<00:01:56.310> why<00:01:56.729> is<00:01:56.790> that<00:01:57.030> happening<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:58.219> for<00:01:59.219> me

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
why why is that happening and for me

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.649 
why why is that happening and for me
it's<00:01:59.520> like<00:01:59.640> trace<00:01:59.909> it<00:02:00.060> back<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.240> a<00:02:00.390> thought

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
it's like trace it back to a thought

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.350 
it's like trace it back to a thought
what<00:02:00.840> is<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.110> thinking<00:02:01.439> going<00:02:02.399> on<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:02.820> even

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
what is the thinking going on and even

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.350 
what is the thinking going on and even
deeper<00:02:03.840> what's<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.560> emotion<00:02:05.189> going<00:02:05.969> on<00:02:06.180> and

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
deeper what's the emotion going on and

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.419 
deeper what's the emotion going on and
if<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:06.570> saw<00:02:06.719> and<00:02:07.380> even<00:02:07.740> deeper<00:02:08.009> than<00:02:08.039> that<00:02:08.310> is

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
if you saw and even deeper than that is

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.859 
if you saw and even deeper than that is
a<00:02:08.459> belief<00:02:08.759> so<00:02:08.970> you<00:02:09.060> can<00:02:09.179> look<00:02:09.360> for<00:02:09.539> my

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
a belief so you can look for my

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.869 
a belief so you can look for my
video<00:02:10.049> I<00:02:10.110> did<00:02:10.349> just<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.649> other<00:02:10.739> day<00:02:10.830> about<00:02:11.400> the

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
video I did just the other day about the

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:14.539 
video I did just the other day about the
different<00:02:12.209> layers<00:02:12.390> of<00:02:12.659> performance<00:02:13.489> but<00:02:14.489> I

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549 
different layers of performance but I

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:15.949 
different layers of performance but I
hate<00:02:14.700> for<00:02:14.879> now<00:02:15.000> I<00:02:15.030> will<00:02:15.150> just<00:02:15.180> say<00:02:15.450> look<00:02:15.629> one

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
hate for now I will just say look one

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.619 
hate for now I will just say look one
layer<00:02:16.170> deeper<00:02:16.799> and<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.940> second<00:02:18.299> thing<00:02:18.450> I<00:02:18.540> want

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
layer deeper and the second thing I want

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:20.630 
layer deeper and the second thing I want
to<00:02:18.780> share<00:02:19.470> is<00:02:19.739> that<00:02:19.769> what<00:02:20.280> they're<00:02:20.430> going<00:02:20.580> to

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
to share is that what they're going to

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.380 
to share is that what they're going to
do<00:02:20.879> is<00:02:21.269> move<00:02:22.110> my<00:02:22.560> own<00:02:23.099> are<00:02:23.310> nerve<00:02:23.610> from<00:02:24.000> here

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
do is move my own are nerve from here

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.110 
do is move my own are nerve from here
over<00:02:24.870> to<00:02:25.110> here<00:02:25.459> they're<00:02:26.459> going<00:02:26.640> to<00:02:26.730> take<00:02:26.940> it<00:02:27.060> a

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
over to here they're going to take it a

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.149 
over to here they're going to take it a
different<00:02:27.420> route<00:02:27.599> it's<00:02:27.780> it's<00:02:28.159> being

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:29.159 
different route it's it's being

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:31.759 
different route it's it's being
compromised<00:02:29.760> again<00:02:30.000> somehow<00:02:30.390> here<00:02:30.810> and<00:02:30.989> so

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
compromised again somehow here and so

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.979 
compromised again somehow here and so
they're<00:02:31.980> going<00:02:32.099> to<00:02:32.220> move<00:02:32.519> it<00:02:32.700> excuse<00:02:33.659> me

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
they're going to move it excuse me

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:35.960 
they're going to move it excuse me
so<00:02:34.409> what<00:02:35.220> does<00:02:35.340> has<00:02:35.459> that<00:02:35.640> relate<00:02:35.879> to

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
so what does has that relate to

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.550 
so what does has that relate to
performance<00:02:36.090> well<00:02:36.540> sometimes<00:02:36.900> we<00:02:37.079> get<00:02:37.230> stuck

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
performance well sometimes we get stuck

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.559 
performance well sometimes we get stuck
in<00:02:37.739> a<00:02:37.829> rut<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:38.310> a<00:02:38.610> rut<00:02:38.790> that<00:02:38.819> isn't<00:02:39.209> working

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
in a rut and a rut that isn't working

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.119 
in a rut and a rut that isn't working
but<00:02:39.690> we<00:02:39.810> don't<00:02:39.959> know<00:02:40.200> it<00:02:40.379> the<00:02:40.530> doctor<00:02:40.860> said<00:02:41.010> hey

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
but we don't know it the doctor said hey

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:44.210 
but we don't know it the doctor said hey
you<00:02:41.190> must<00:02:41.519> not<00:02:42.209> be<00:02:42.420> a<00:02:42.450> big<00:02:42.660> complainer<00:02:43.170> and<00:02:43.680> I

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
you must not be a big complainer and I

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.440 
you must not be a big complainer and I
said<00:02:44.430> well<00:02:44.579> why<00:02:44.700> is<00:02:44.760> that<00:02:44.879> he<00:02:45.060> said<00:02:45.209> well<00:02:45.359> you

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
said well why is that he said well you

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.759 
said well why is that he said well you
know<00:02:45.540> you<00:02:45.989> could<00:02:46.200> have<00:02:46.260> been<00:02:46.410> in<00:02:46.530> here<00:02:46.650> a<00:02:46.709> long

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
know you could have been in here a long

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.830 
know you could have been in here a long
time<00:02:47.129> ago<00:02:47.400> and<00:02:47.549> your<00:02:47.910> hand<00:02:48.239> wouldn't<00:02:48.540> be<00:02:48.660> in<00:02:48.720> as

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
time ago and your hand wouldn't be in as

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.449 
time ago and your hand wouldn't be in as
bad<00:02:49.019> shape<00:02:49.319> as<00:02:49.530> it<00:02:49.560> was<00:02:49.799> but<00:02:49.950> it<00:02:50.069> was<00:02:50.099> just<00:02:50.280> a

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
bad shape as it was but it was just a

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.220 
bad shape as it was but it was just a
gradual<00:02:50.910> thing<00:02:51.209> it<00:02:51.420> was<00:02:51.510> always<00:02:51.690> like<00:02:51.930> just

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
gradual thing it was always like just

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.569 
gradual thing it was always like just
that's<00:02:52.680> just<00:02:52.890> how<00:02:53.040> it<00:02:53.220> is

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
that's just how it is

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:55.280 
that's just how it is
we've<00:02:54.090> come<00:02:54.239> to<00:02:54.390> accept<00:02:54.629> things<00:02:54.870> that<00:02:55.109> just

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
we've come to accept things that just

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.080 
we've come to accept things that just
that's<00:02:55.650> how<00:02:55.829> it<00:02:56.010> is<00:02:56.129> and<00:02:56.310> they<00:02:56.370> can<00:02:56.400> gradually

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
that's how it is and they can gradually

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.789 
that's how it is and they can gradually
deteriorate<00:02:57.870> so<00:02:58.019> it's<00:02:58.170> good<00:02:58.319> to<00:02:58.349> have<00:02:58.530> some

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
deteriorate so it's good to have some

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.069 
deteriorate so it's good to have some
kind<00:02:59.010> of<00:02:59.069> experience<00:02:59.549> that<00:02:59.849> brings<00:03:00.420> awareness

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
kind of experience that brings awareness

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:03.860 
kind of experience that brings awareness
of<00:03:01.290> what<00:03:02.250> is<00:03:02.430> actually<00:03:02.670> going<00:03:03.030> on<00:03:03.239> versus<00:03:03.690> what

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
of what is actually going on versus what

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.750 
of what is actually going on versus what
could<00:03:04.200> go<00:03:04.650> on<00:03:04.859> and<00:03:05.129> that's<00:03:05.280> a<00:03:05.430> lot<00:03:05.609> of<00:03:05.640> the

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
could go on and that's a lot of the

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.910 
could go on and that's a lot of the
exercises<00:03:06.359> in<00:03:06.510> my<00:03:06.659> programs<00:03:07.109> are<00:03:07.620> really

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
exercises in my programs are really

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.099 
exercises in my programs are really
designed<00:03:08.340> to<00:03:08.549> die<00:03:09.150> are<00:03:09.209> you<00:03:09.420> out<00:03:09.629> of<00:03:09.659> a<00:03:09.840> rut

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:10.109 
designed to die are you out of a rut

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:11.809 
designed to die are you out of a rut
take<00:03:10.349> you<00:03:10.530> out<00:03:10.739> of<00:03:10.950> someplace<00:03:11.310> that's<00:03:11.579> not

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
take you out of someplace that's not

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:13.819 
take you out of someplace that's not
working<00:03:12.060> and<00:03:12.420> move<00:03:12.930> you<00:03:13.109> to<00:03:13.260> a<00:03:13.290> place<00:03:13.620> that's

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
working and move you to a place that's

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:16.970 
working and move you to a place that's
better<00:03:14.099> for<00:03:14.220> you<00:03:14.459> and<00:03:15.139> thirdly<00:03:16.139> the<00:03:16.560> the<00:03:16.799> last

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
better for you and thirdly the the last

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.280 
better for you and thirdly the the last
point<00:03:17.340> is<00:03:17.579> how<00:03:18.090> is<00:03:18.269> it<00:03:18.389> going<00:03:18.599> to<00:03:18.660> happen<00:03:18.780> well

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
point is how is it going to happen well

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.020 
point is how is it going to happen well
the<00:03:19.410> surgeon<00:03:19.620> is<00:03:19.829> going<00:03:19.859> to<00:03:20.069> cut<00:03:20.220> me<00:03:20.400> with<00:03:20.970> a

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
the surgeon is going to cut me with a

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.839 
the surgeon is going to cut me with a
knife<00:03:21.150> he's<00:03:21.930> going<00:03:22.230> to<00:03:22.319> take<00:03:22.500> a<00:03:22.530> knife<00:03:22.849> maybe

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:23.849 
knife he's going to take a knife maybe

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:26.000 
knife he's going to take a knife maybe
similar<00:03:24.329> to<00:03:24.480> this<00:03:24.599> one<00:03:24.780> I'm<00:03:24.900> not<00:03:25.049> sure<00:03:25.349> but

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
similar to this one I'm not sure but

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:31.129 
similar to this one I'm not sure but
he'll<00:03:26.940> cut<00:03:27.329> then<00:03:28.519> basically<00:03:29.519> from<00:03:29.819> here<00:03:30.139> to

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:31.139 
he'll cut then basically from here to

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:33.349 
he'll cut then basically from here to
here<00:03:31.620> just<00:03:32.160> to<00:03:32.280> get<00:03:32.400> in<00:03:32.519> there<00:03:32.730> and<00:03:32.910> move<00:03:33.150> the

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
here just to get in there and move the

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:36.409 
here just to get in there and move the
nerve<00:03:33.599> and<00:03:34.430> when<00:03:35.430> I<00:03:35.459> think<00:03:35.579> about<00:03:35.819> this<00:03:36.239> I

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:36.419 
nerve and when I think about this I

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:39.170 
nerve and when I think about this I
think<00:03:36.690> about<00:03:37.190> focus<00:03:38.190> because<00:03:38.730> this<00:03:38.879> will<00:03:39.090> be

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
think about focus because this will be

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.939 
think about focus because this will be
very<00:03:39.299> focused<00:03:39.780> as<00:03:39.900> you<00:03:39.930> compare<00:03:40.410> this<00:03:40.650> to<00:03:40.919> a

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:40.949 
very focused as you compare this to a

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:44.270 
very focused as you compare this to a
spoon<00:03:41.370> and<00:03:41.730> the<00:03:42.510> spoon<00:03:43.040> especially<00:03:44.040> on<00:03:44.160> the

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
spoon and the spoon especially on the

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.059 
spoon and the spoon especially on the
bottom<00:03:44.430> here<00:03:44.879> is<00:03:45.030> all<00:03:45.449> rounded<00:03:46.230> means<00:03:46.859> like

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
bottom here is all rounded means like

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:48.949 
bottom here is all rounded means like
well<00:03:47.280> I'll<00:03:47.579> focus<00:03:47.970> some<00:03:48.180> over<00:03:48.389> here<00:03:48.690> and<00:03:48.870> I'll

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
well I'll focus some over here and I'll

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.449 
well I'll focus some over here and I'll
focus<00:03:49.290> somewhere<00:03:49.530> here<00:03:49.949> oh<00:03:50.099> and<00:03:50.129> over<00:03:50.340> here

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
focus somewhere here oh and over here

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.490 
focus somewhere here oh and over here
and<00:03:50.760> yeah<00:03:50.879> yeah<00:03:51.329> and<00:03:51.599> this<00:03:51.780> is<00:03:51.930> important<00:03:52.349> too

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
and yeah yeah and this is important too

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.150 
and yeah yeah and this is important too
of<00:03:52.680> course

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
of course

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.159 
of course
but<00:03:53.579> I've<00:03:53.669> got<00:03:53.819> these<00:03:53.970> other<00:03:54.180> things<00:03:54.480> that<00:03:55.049> I'm

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:55.169 
but I've got these other things that I'm

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:57.530 
but I've got these other things that I'm
paying<00:03:55.410> attention<00:03:55.919> to<00:03:56.099> also<00:03:56.519> and<00:03:57.060> the<00:03:57.180> result

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
paying attention to also and the result

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.069 
paying attention to also and the result
is<00:03:57.750> you<00:03:58.579> know<00:03:59.579> no<00:03:59.819> damage<00:04:00.239> even<00:04:00.389> the<00:04:00.629> tip<00:04:00.840> is

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
is you know no damage even the tip is

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:02.780 
is you know no damage even the tip is
that<00:04:01.109> go<00:04:01.349> that's<00:04:01.590> a<00:04:01.650> little<00:04:01.829> bit<00:04:01.980> better<00:04:02.160> but

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
that go that's a little bit better but

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:08.240 
that go that's a little bit better but
it<00:04:02.940> still<00:04:03.239> really<00:04:04.169> isn't<00:04:05.690> anywhere<00:04:06.690> near<00:04:07.250> what

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
it still really isn't anywhere near what

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.089 
it still really isn't anywhere near what
this<00:04:08.459> is<00:04:08.760> in<00:04:09.000> terms<00:04:09.660> of<00:04:09.870> focus<00:04:10.290> and<00:04:10.470> that's<00:04:10.919> how

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:11.099 
this is in terms of focus and that's how

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:13.220 
this is in terms of focus and that's how
performance<00:04:11.639> goes<00:04:11.819> and<00:04:12.090> success<00:04:12.510> goes<00:04:12.810> really

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
performance goes and success goes really

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.550 
performance goes and success goes really
if<00:04:13.620> you're<00:04:13.799> able<00:04:14.040> to<00:04:14.069> be<00:04:14.310> really<00:04:14.819> focused<00:04:15.720> then

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
if you're able to be really focused then

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.920 
if you're able to be really focused then
you<00:04:17.099> are<00:04:17.400> going<00:04:17.820> to<00:04:18.000> have<00:04:18.180> your<00:04:18.329> best<00:04:18.479> chances

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
you are going to have your best chances

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
you are going to have your best chances
if<00:04:19.109> she<00:04:19.229> doesn't<00:04:19.530> guarantee

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
if she doesn't guarantee

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.440 
if she doesn't guarantee
success<00:04:20.340> doesn't<00:04:20.610> you<00:04:20.850> know<00:04:20.970> just<00:04:21.330> because

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
success doesn't you know just because

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:22.970 
success doesn't you know just because
the<00:04:21.570> guys<00:04:21.720> got<00:04:21.960> a<00:04:21.990> sharp<00:04:22.260> scalpel<00:04:22.410> today

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:22.980 
the guys got a sharp scalpel today

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.290 
the guys got a sharp scalpel today
doesn't<00:04:23.280> mean<00:04:23.310> that<00:04:23.520> surgery<00:04:24.180> will<00:04:24.270> be

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
doesn't mean that surgery will be

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.600 
doesn't mean that surgery will be
successful<00:04:24.960> but<00:04:25.860> it'll<00:04:26.100> be<00:04:26.160> well<00:04:26.340> be<00:04:26.490> better

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
successful but it'll be well be better

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.310 
successful but it'll be well be better
off<00:04:26.850> than<00:04:27.060> if<00:04:27.090> he<00:04:27.270> tries<00:04:27.570> to<00:04:27.600> cut<00:04:27.930> me<00:04:28.110> with<00:04:28.290> a

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
off than if he tries to cut me with a

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.060 
off than if he tries to cut me with a
spoon

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
spoon

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.310 
spoon
so<00:04:29.610> those<00:04:30.120> are<00:04:30.240> three<00:04:30.510> performance

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
so those are three performance

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.230 
so those are three performance
principles<00:04:31.800> that<00:04:32.100> I<00:04:32.370> was<00:04:32.640> thinking<00:04:32.910> about<00:04:33.000> as

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
principles that I was thinking about as

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.060 
principles that I was thinking about as
I<00:04:33.360> was<00:04:33.510> getting<00:04:33.630> ready<00:04:33.930> for<00:04:34.200> it<00:04:34.320> today<00:04:34.470> and<00:04:34.920> I

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
I was getting ready for it today and I

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.030 
I was getting ready for it today and I
just<00:04:35.250> wanted<00:04:35.460> to<00:04:35.580> pass<00:04:35.790> them<00:04:36.090> on<00:04:36.560> so<00:04:37.560> one<00:04:37.830> is

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
just wanted to pass them on so one is

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.730 
just wanted to pass them on so one is
look<00:04:38.250> a<00:04:38.370> layer<00:04:38.550> deeper<00:04:39.030> than<00:04:39.570> what<00:04:40.170> what<00:04:40.530> does

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
look a layer deeper than what what does

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.610 
look a layer deeper than what what does
you're<00:04:41.010> seeing<00:04:41.720> on<00:04:42.720> your<00:04:42.960> eye<00:04:43.110> level<00:04:43.380> that's

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
you're seeing on your eye level that's

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.680 
you're seeing on your eye level that's
just<00:04:43.800> that's<00:04:44.280> a<00:04:44.430> huge<00:04:44.700> point<00:04:45.030> that<00:04:45.270> so<00:04:45.480> much<00:04:45.660> of

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
just that's a huge point that so much of

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.020 
just that's a huge point that so much of
what<00:04:45.840> my<00:04:46.140> world<00:04:46.410> is<00:04:46.710> is<00:04:47.070> dealing<00:04:47.640> with<00:04:47.760> what's

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
what my world is is dealing with what's

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.570 
what my world is is dealing with what's
underneath<00:04:48.500> what<00:04:49.500> everyone<00:04:49.890> else<00:04:50.070> is<00:04:50.280> seeing

underneath what everyone else is seeing

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.760 
underneath what everyone else is seeing
whatever<00:04:50.790> we<00:04:51.090> can<00:04:51.240> see<00:04:51.480> with<00:04:52.200> the<00:04:52.320> naked<00:04:52.470> eye

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
whatever we can see with the naked eye

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.240 
whatever we can see with the naked eye
and<00:04:53.070> then<00:04:53.670> look<00:04:53.910> to<00:04:54.030> take<00:04:54.240> a<00:04:54.500> get<00:04:55.500> jarred

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
and then look to take a get jarred

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.760 
and then look to take a get jarred
yourself<00:04:56.760> into<00:04:57.180> a<00:04:57.210> new<00:04:57.540> more<00:04:57.990> efficient<00:04:58.500> route
