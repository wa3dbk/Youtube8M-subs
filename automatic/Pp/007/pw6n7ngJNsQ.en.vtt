check whichever win Super Bowl how do
you<00:02:35.769> find<00:02:35.950> them<00:02:36.099> but<00:02:36.609> that's<00:02:36.879> the<00:02:37.000> only<00:02:37.180> way<00:02:37.299> I

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:37.329 
you find them but that's the only way I

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:38.819 
you find them but that's the only way I
believe<00:02:37.629> he<00:02:37.780> saves<00:02:38.019> his<00:02:38.170> job<00:02:38.379> but<00:02:38.560> if<00:02:38.620> we<00:02:38.709> get

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:38.829 
believe he saves his job but if we get

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:40.199 
believe he saves his job but if we get
in<00:02:38.920> the<00:02:38.980> playoffs<00:02:39.159> we<00:02:39.760> weren't<00:02:39.970> that<00:02:40.030> good<00:02:40.150> a

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
in the playoffs we weren't that good a

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:41.490 
in the playoffs we weren't that good a
football<00:02:40.540> team<00:02:40.689> we<00:02:40.810> might<00:02:40.930> we<00:02:41.170> probably<00:02:41.319> would

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
football team we might we probably would

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.630 
football team we might we probably would
have<00:02:41.530> lost<00:02:41.680> the<00:02:41.829> first<00:02:42.010> round<00:02:42.159> because<00:02:42.459> we've

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
have lost the first round because we've

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.750 
have lost the first round because we've
been<00:02:42.730> on<00:02:42.819> the<00:02:42.940> road<00:02:43.090> but<00:02:44.340> we've<00:02:45.340> been<00:02:45.489> at<00:02:45.579> Green

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
been on the road but we've been at Green

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.789 
been on the road but we've been at Green
Bay<00:02:45.790> which<00:02:46.659> we've<00:02:47.049> seen<00:02:47.290> the<00:02:47.379> success<00:02:47.500> the

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
Bay which we've seen the success the

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:49.080 
Bay which we've seen the success the
Bears<00:02:47.980> have<00:02:48.099> against<00:02:48.310> Green<00:02:48.459> Bay<00:02:48.489> lately<00:02:48.849> so

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
Bears have against Green Bay lately so

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.430 
Bears have against Green Bay lately so
it<00:02:49.420> would<00:02:49.540> have<00:02:49.629> been<00:02:49.720> a<00:02:49.750> tough<00:02:49.930> place<00:02:50.109> to<00:02:50.290> win

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
it would have been a tough place to win

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.009 
it would have been a tough place to win
for<00:02:50.680> us<00:02:50.799> but<00:02:51.220> um<00:02:51.370> I<00:02:51.609> really<00:02:52.150> believe<00:02:52.329> that<00:02:52.359> mine

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
for us but um I really believe that mine

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:54.750 
for us but um I really believe that mine
was<00:02:53.139> made<00:02:53.260> up<00:02:53.409> before<00:02:53.680> that<00:02:53.799> game<00:02:53.950> ok<00:02:54.519> fair

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
was made up before that game ok fair

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.990 
was made up before that game ok fair
enough

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
enough

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.910 
enough
I've<00:02:55.150> always<00:02:55.329> viewed<00:02:55.599> it<00:02:55.780> as<00:02:55.900> if<00:02:56.560> you<00:02:56.709> made

minimum ten and six and you lose your

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:06.780 
minimum ten and six and you lose your

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
job but the way he turned things around

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.179
