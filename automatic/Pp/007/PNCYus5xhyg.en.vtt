00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.040
 it's normal is not a thing that looks 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.839
 every day that we do here this is 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.610

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.059
 history of maritime salvage-- da 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:54.100
 Access to teach what is training 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.110
 rescue donor of the helicopter here 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.059
 is where swimmers start 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.350
 rescue those who tomorrow when 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:01.660
 let's have an emergency on a ship in 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.610
 a sailboat let's call on the radio 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.610
 phone those who are going to download are these 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.789
 guys that today start their 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.800
 learning 

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:12.340
 you have to have a special pasta you have to 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:14.220
 be different I think a rescue 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.870
 he is a normal person 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.400
 simply that it has a clear vocation 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:21.070
 of the help service to others 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:24.130
 we came to see this afternoon what we are going to 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.600
 see is the full rescue exercise 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.560
 simulating that you jump from a 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.000
 helicopter 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.740
 you have to swim by approaching a 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.420
 life raft where there is a 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.880
 survivor and install that 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.470
 survivor and then by basket 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.170
 of rescue evacuate it to the safety of 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.180
 helicopter is one of the parties in another 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.490
 let's see a simulate a helicopter 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.650
 that falls into the water if another party 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.900
 of training is the simulation of 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.120
 that you are flying in a helicopter 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.650
 maritime rescue and for the reason 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.480
 be the helicopter rushes into the 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.100
 water and it is the training of 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.840
 skills that allow you to go out with 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.730
 life of the helicopter cabin in 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.950
 if you fall apart from the 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:03.280
 flares and smoke cans if they are 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:06.100
 normal signaling materials 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.140
 for what is our work and it 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.119
 uses both on our part and for 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.010
 part of the people who need 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.020
 help and I said before that is the 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.610
 first time this is shown if it is the 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.240
 first time maritime rescue 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.760
 access the press to have the 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.050
 direct knowledge recording images and 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.610
 taking pictures of what is the 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.720
 rescue swimmer training 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.440
 Well, they want to be because they are going to 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.030
 see step by step thank you and now we go back 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.400
 to see how those swimmers work 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.230
 maritime salvage rescuers that 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.239
 for the first time they have been able to record today 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.489
 some television cameras those of 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:42.370
 connection asturias two exercises we 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:45.450
 proposed to see them in action and to 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.450
 let's go immediately 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.930
 there are only 150 rescue swimmers in 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.150
 españa 'imagine that it should not be anything 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.860
 easy to get it they are the first 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.050
 who attend if second a boat as 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.120
 recent santana our coasts or the 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.319
 Mar Marin sent and does it many times 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.050
 in the harshest conditions 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:05.390
 sometimes imaginable weather 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.980
 at night and in extreme situations 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.270
 André is one of those aspirants who 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.670
 train these days in the center 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.170
 jovellanos now with waves andrés is more 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.209
 difficult it's still me but the truth 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.290
 that does not get a little more 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.870
 complicated the beginning of the week 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.220
 is being a bit light for us 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.770
 that we are used to water and that 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.780
 and today we have to do the 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.760
 Evening practices also from 9 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.580
 until 11 and a half so let's see how 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.550
 is presented to others, this is almost 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.989
 as for heroes this is how it is done 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:34.190
 from outside a little complicated that 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.830
 soon for us that we carry 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.840
 me since I was 12 years old and I'm surfing and 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.940
 that acquisition swimming the truth that 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.830
 I love water and that and perfect 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.360
 you have in the future as a swimmer 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.040
 rescue will have to try the truth 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.440
 that I would like to have changed 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.079
 a lot of being here a pool with sun 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.069
 and that at night with a cyclogenesis 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:54.550
 of these 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:56.800
 this winter to her 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:59.230
 you have to think differently but 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.970
 well you have to try cyclogenesis and 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.010
 rescues aerial signage 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.470
 accidents dives to great 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.630
 depth are the day to day of the 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.910
 rescue swimmers now imagine yourself 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.460
 a helicopter falls overboard one 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:15.610
 rescue swimmer logically has to 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:18.600
 know how to get out attentive are reviewing the 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.600
 emergency signs 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.680
 they just gave the ready 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.930
 the helicopter rushes over 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.930
 Water 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:36.090
 they look at the windows they place a hand in 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.520
 a fixed point to know where they are going to 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.819
 leave the soon by helicopter starts at 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.819
 overturn 

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:46.029
 now although we may not be 

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:48.129
 seeing inside are soldiers in the 

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:50.619
 safety belt with the hand that 

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:51.939
 they had in the serving window of 

00:04:50.619 --> 00:04:54.389
 guide to get out of the 

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:54.389
 helicopter 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:05:02.139
 and they have managed to get out of the helicopter 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:02.139
 thanks to a breathing device 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:06.410
 gives the signal that it is ok and now 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.090
 would start another phase that would be the 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:11.090
 survival but here those who train 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:13.130
 is to leave the chain for two 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:15.590
 weeks these young people will be trained to 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:17.570
 get your dream and this is just the 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:19.220
 first step two years of career 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:20.960
 professional and a lot of effort and 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.060
 dedication still separate them from their 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.590
 objective in asturias have a great 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.720
 place to form this center 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:29.120
 jovellanos in gijón and train and 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.490
 train but always with something very clear 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:35.110
 in his head the reality always always 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.110
 will overcome the hobby
