00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.850
 good afternoon dear fishermen yesterday 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:11.010
 there was a question from people involved 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.820
 Fedor how to make something a feeder on 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.699
 flow 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:22.560
 not demolished fedor enough 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.630
 long ago such an idea was born everybody knows that 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.080
 can insert 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:30.480
 wire feeder as a mustache 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:35.430
 aluminum or copper and it will 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:37.309
 to land when pebble 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.800
 it will be an operation and not give 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:44.719
 feeders seems canvas click on 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:48.200
 The condition of the problem was such that 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:50.820
 you are afraid of a symmetrical loop and afraid 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.370
 sweep over the snap-over here that's mustache 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.860
 sticking so you needed something 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.670
 come up with 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:01.280
 Yesterday such an idea was born controversially . 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:06.570
 and i will explain 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:10.610
 since the water was obtained that I want 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:13.860
 here takes with 100 flipping through the wire 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:19.890
 poured spring led pin 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:23.060
 such two tips are bent so 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:28.320
 slightly in lead 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:33.079
 feeders bore hole and this 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.079
 spring short self tapping am 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:41.660
 screwed screwed here it is 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.110
 to 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:48.600
 bent our edges looking at the loop 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.850
 what is the point here we have these whiskers 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:55.230
 but how to make them not cling 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:02:03.720
 snap well here's an idea born such 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:05.990
 everyone knows carp wiki there are skaters who 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:10.710
 taking advantage of these things there are two 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:12.810
 soluble mesh 2 soluble filament like 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:16.080
 make everything fast enough 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:21.420
 on the pond you can here and bow me here 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:22.320
 two sleeves with a piece tied possible and 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.130
 to the right of the thread 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:29.160
 impose a loop of small diameters 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.830
 somewhere a centimeter is enough neck 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:35.370
 keep that in the box so that the moisture does not 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.860
 would somehow happen you 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.200
 slaughtering the feeder 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.050
 mustache in combat 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.780
 so say the provisions wear a loop 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.989
 and you have a mustache and that's great 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.780
 tied up need less and hold you mustache 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.910
 over there in this position or if 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:58.040
 less will loop in this position then 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:02.040
 there are no longer stick up sides and will not 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:05.040
 confused snap ie as it were already 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.930
 overlap snap minimized in 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.900
 further possible in any case even 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.480
 when just feed the grain it comes down 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.540
 to the minimum here now we will see how 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:24.300
 it will most likely happen 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:25.790
 enough a piece cut off let's see how 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:30.720
 thats going to happen 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:34.020
 oops and all that you already have grouser 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.530
 opened literally until the feeder reached 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:39.250
 to the bottom it was not dissolved 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:45.040
 that is, after splashdown 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:47.440
 it 's about three to four seconds if 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:54.460
 the depth of the place of catching more you can just 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:55.900
 Twice wrapped or well that is it 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:04:00.209
 Yet experimentally 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:04.480
 what thickness you need is calculated 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:06.700
 make was fasteners to dissolve 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:11.080
 for the time while the feeder was brought 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:14.050
 until it falls on one just behind 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:16.900
 several casts and you will be equal 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.709
 calculate if you know the pit you 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.870
 will calculate 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.000
 depending on the strength of the current how much 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.230
 you need to forward upstream to throw 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.150
 to feed 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:28.150
 you have developed in the place where you 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:32.169
 planned to catch a pit or bump 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:35.560
 so on due to this you quickly 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:39.760
 read how much time it takes 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:42.580
 the opening of the hooks and so he opened it 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.860
 will be lying at the bottom of the operation nowhere 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.660
 not going anywhere 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:49.030
 Now the decision has matured not know on 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:54.360
 how much it will be relevant will show 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:57.970
 practice hope guys if not tested 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:00.580
 then they will write off saying that from this 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:04.660
 It turned out if you do not something here 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:07.060
 like you can always turn out 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:11.860
 screw and the same applies to the original 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:16.690
 as a fountain in her holes grouser 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:18.580
 that again can be done if it is for you 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.229
 don't disturb ace and unscientific excavator 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.300
 can do with copper wire with 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:27.240
 annealed 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:29.979
 so that it bends aluminum Alice 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:33.550
 the beauty of this lug is that he 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:37.300
 even the case of constricted 1 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:39.669
 if somewhere he will stand up prokasta 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.690
 sheets she just plain with very 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:44.819
 a little effort 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:49.810
 she will bend go around not hook that is 

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:54.009
 hooked on this grunt oil 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:56.590
 that is, how would this lug not 

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:59.800
 allowing the feeders to roll onto 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:02.770
 bottom on the wall for he just did not 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:06.190
 will cling to some obstacles 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:08.909
 snags or rare stones and so on then 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:11.620
 there is no harm 

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:14.349
 But that's all I think the rest of the 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:17.710
 Think yourself ideas as I hope hopefully 

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:21.150
 and ideas how we see the workers see 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:21.150
 what are you the bottom of the reservoir while
