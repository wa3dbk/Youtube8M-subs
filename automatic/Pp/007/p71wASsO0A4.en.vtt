 can be available only on xbox one and 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.469
 we can not find 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:46.309

 if it's a camouflage that say more 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.740
 that on xbox one so the camouflage the 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.600
 spectrum is actually I'm here too 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.330
 today to tell you how 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.930
 have it on xbox 360 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.960
 so here we are going to start 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.210
 go to practice so simply 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:26.670
 you must log in at all 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:28.799
 first time to your xbox one so or 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.950
 so at the xbox or a buddy like you 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.630
 want 6 to that of a friend you have to 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.759
 transfer your profile so have the 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.470
 password and limeil of your account 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.060
 microsoft 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.500
 so there's nothing more against more 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.170
 easy nothing more complicated no matter 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.500
 what is easier 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:48.090
 just he just has to be 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.820
 transferred to normally that you will see 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.840
 on the internet the tutorial to transfer the 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.920
 for now I can not because he 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.890
 is already transferred so here is 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.960
 so you transfer your profile after 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.990
 if your friend at call of duty kids is 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.729
 great is what it takes anyway 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.399
 so you started ghost so as I 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.739
 done here's not against me though I 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:13.209
 I'm over 360 so actually done the same 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:16.790
 so you have in the multiplayer so 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.650
 simply it's easy to anything 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.390
 simpler 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.989
 so of course while using your 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.720
 xbox 360 / lawal profile so you 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:31.250
 put xbox live 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:33.739
 so that's just so 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:37.030
 profile recovery we are waiting on 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:40.989
 wait, we're waiting for the most boring stuff 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:44.120

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:47.870
 in banon your two soldiers just like everything 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:50.540

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.900
 there simply down you have your 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.690
 armed 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.060
 so your 360 weapons so what you 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.080
 did on ghost or so everything 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.549
 simply if you have not yet 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.320
 played ghost and you start there 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:02.450
 play you're going to stay on your 60 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.180

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.480
 anything so that's all 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.970
 simply you have your classes so 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.010
 that you find here so not everything 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.470
 just you select here it is 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:20.060
 so no the equipment so you go 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:21.890
 on to say camouflage is everything 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.900
 simply you will choose it 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.120
 normally it will be down right 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.940
 so as you see I'm not because 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.670

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.480
 explain so you select him 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.420
 normally that's you the master so 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:38.060
 camouflage is a pretty camouflage 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.290
 well I find so I did I did 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.980
 several gameplay I was told that 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.750
 many wanted this camouflage and she 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.069
 wanted to know how to get it so I 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.390
 tell me bah let's do a little tutorial 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:52.220
 so that's it 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.670
 that's why I'm here too 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.590
 today 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.239
 so that's it then you select 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.030
 camouflage so that's it's done you 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:00.799
 have camouflage on your everything 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.750
 just your weapon so you do 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:03.890
 that certain to all your classes a penny 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.060
 you want like this moment 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.470
 you are quiet you have not 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.480
 obliged to return to your friend for 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.050
 return to the lawan home to hand over the 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.730
 camouflage 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.620
 so now when it's done 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.630
 not just you leave the one 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.150
 you are disconnecting your profile 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.079
 so you leave the game will be saved 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.090
 do not worry you 're a 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.709
 camouflage to back up and everything 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.590

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:27.140
 it's back on 360 launched ghost and 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:30.430
 there normally if you go back here 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:33.919
 you will find this your equipment 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:37.250
 accompanied by your spectrum camouflage 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:40.460
 so just here for now 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:42.020

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.580
 you only have it on man and that's the 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.800
 only way to have it for now 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.250
 from what I've seen and from what 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:51.380
 I tried to do so 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:53.330
 this is a tutorial very very short so 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:56.419
 how to have the spectrum camouflage 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:58.180
 especially on 60 the sierre part of the one 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:01.340
 so simply 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:04.520
 so here is voili voili and then 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:06.890
 So here I am, I tell you 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.260
 next for a brand new video 

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:11.890
 so 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:16.930
 if I explain to you it will be a video 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:19.660

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.060
 there for now I have a little break 

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.560
 on my channel normally it's a 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.120
 video a week but I think I 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:40.030
 will have a little break in by 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.380
 course because it's true 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:44.710
 that I have more time for 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.940
 the moment but good game later do not you 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.760
 do not worry as soon as I have 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.710
 better material more time I 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.090
 could do a lot better as a video 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.460
 so much more in any case 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:56.800
