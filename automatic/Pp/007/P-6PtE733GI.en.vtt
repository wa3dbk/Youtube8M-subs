hey everybody today we're going to apply

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.590 
hey everybody today we're going to apply
those<00:00:15.770> three<00:00:16.430> disparate<00:00:16.760> string<00:00:17.060> major

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:17.600 
those three disparate string major

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.920 
those three disparate string major
scales<00:00:18.040> to<00:00:19.040> some<00:00:19.640> technique<00:00:20.060> exercises<00:00:20.510> we're

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:20.930 
scales to some technique exercises we're

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.660 
scales to some technique exercises we're
going<00:00:21.050> to<00:00:21.110> work<00:00:21.260> on<00:00:21.440> some<00:00:21.740> alternate<00:00:22.520> picking

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:22.670

lessons and this is going to really let

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.790 
lessons and this is going to really let
us<00:00:26.600> get<00:00:26.779> a<00:00:26.810> handle<00:00:26.900> on<00:00:27.700> our<00:00:28.700> picking<00:00:29.300> technique

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:29.800 
us get a handle on our picking technique

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.130 
us get a handle on our picking technique
and<00:00:30.800> getting<00:00:31.580> these<00:00:31.669> forms<00:00:32.180> going<00:00:32.780> around<00:00:33.020> the

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
and getting these forms going around the

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.730 
and getting these forms going around the
neck<00:00:34.300> when<00:00:35.300> I<00:00:35.329> do<00:00:35.450> these<00:00:35.690> exercises<00:00:36.230> I'm<00:00:36.710> going

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:36.740 
neck when I do these exercises I'm going

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.520 
neck when I do these exercises I'm going
to<00:00:36.920> do<00:00:37.010> them<00:00:37.190> with<00:00:37.340> one<00:00:37.579> of<00:00:37.730> the<00:00:37.820> forms<00:00:38.270> and<00:00:38.530> but

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
to do them with one of the forms and but

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.729 
to do them with one of the forms and but
they<00:00:39.680> all<00:00:39.890> can<00:00:40.670> be<00:00:40.790> taken<00:00:41.150> through<00:00:41.420> all<00:00:42.260> of<00:00:42.320> the

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
they all can be taken through all of the

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:44.050 
they all can be taken through all of the
forms<00:00:43.100> and<00:00:43.250> that's<00:00:43.640> where<00:00:43.790> you're<00:00:43.880> going<00:00:44.000> to

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:44.060 
forms and that's where you're going to

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.940 
forms and that's where you're going to
get<00:00:44.120> the<00:00:44.240> most<00:00:44.390> out<00:00:44.570> of<00:00:44.630> them<00:00:44.810> if<00:00:44.900> you<00:00:44.990> can<00:00:45.170> find

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:45.950 
get the most out of them if you can find

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.040 
get the most out of them if you can find
the<00:00:46.100> time<00:00:46.280> to<00:00:46.460> do<00:00:46.550> that<00:00:46.790> at<00:00:47.300> least<00:00:47.480> do<00:00:47.660> a<00:00:47.690> couple

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
the time to do that at least do a couple

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.080 
the time to do that at least do a couple
of<00:00:48.080> forms<00:00:48.350> a<00:00:48.470> day<00:00:48.650> and<00:00:48.890> you'll<00:00:49.520> really<00:00:49.730> start

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
of forms a day and you'll really start

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.350 
of forms a day and you'll really start
seeing<00:00:50.150> your<00:00:50.540> technique<00:00:51.410> just<00:00:51.650> take<00:00:52.490> off<00:00:52.700> okay

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
out with exercise number one that is on

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.990 
out with exercise number one that is on
the<00:01:02.800> music<00:01:03.800> printout<00:01:04.189> that<00:01:04.430> you<00:01:04.670> can<00:01:04.790> download

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
the music printout that you can download

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.469 
the music printout that you can download
from<00:01:05.269> the<00:01:05.360> site<00:01:05.659> and<00:01:05.960> it<00:01:06.890> is<00:01:06.920> a<00:01:07.330> you<00:01:08.330> know<00:01:08.360> a

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
from the site and it is a you know a

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.679 
from the site and it is a you know a
rather<00:01:09.110> simple<00:01:09.680> six<00:01:10.400> note<00:01:10.700> pattern<00:01:11.420> it's

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:11.689 
rather simple six note pattern it's

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:14.109 
rather simple six note pattern it's
we're<00:01:12.439> going<00:01:12.590> to<00:01:12.650> do<00:01:12.860> all<00:01:13.040> these<00:01:13.250> and<00:01:13.610> the

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
we're going to do all these and the

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:16.810 
we're going to do all these and the
route<00:01:14.360> all<00:01:15.020> these<00:01:15.350> exercises<00:01:15.799> are<00:01:16.159> built<00:01:16.609> off

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
route all these exercises are built off

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.440 
route all these exercises are built off
of<00:01:16.880> the<00:01:17.570> route<00:01:17.810> the<00:01:18.200> shape<00:01:18.380> of<00:01:18.530> all<00:01:18.619> the<00:01:18.740> route

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
of the route the shape of all the route

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.960 
of the route the shape of all the route
and<00:01:20.689> the<00:01:21.590> key<00:01:21.770> of<00:01:21.860> G<00:01:21.979> off<00:01:22.189> of<00:01:22.340> G<00:01:24.759> so<00:01:25.759> we're<00:01:25.880> going

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
and the key of G off of G so we're going

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.039 
and the key of G off of G so we're going
to<00:01:26.030> start<00:01:26.240> this<00:01:26.360> one<00:01:26.420> right<00:01:26.659> here<00:01:26.840> on<00:01:26.960> the

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
to start this one right here on the

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:29.020 
to start this one right here on the
second<00:01:27.409> string<00:01:27.680> and<00:01:27.830> it's<00:01:28.700> going<00:01:28.820> to<00:01:28.880> be<00:01:29.000> a

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
second string and it's going to be a

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.010 
second string and it's going to be a
Down<00:01:29.360> stroke

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
Down stroke

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.600 
Down stroke
so<00:01:30.740> it's<00:01:30.830> going<00:01:30.920> to<00:01:30.979> be<00:01:31.070> very<00:01:31.250> important<00:01:31.549> to

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
so it's going to be very important to

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.120 
so it's going to be very important to
follow<00:01:31.759> the<00:01:32.030> picking<00:01:32.360> here<00:01:32.869> the<00:01:33.560> down<00:01:33.770> stroke

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
follow the picking here the down stroke

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.249 
follow the picking here the down stroke
the<00:01:34.700> with<00:01:35.360> your<00:01:35.479> first<00:01:35.659> finger<00:01:35.930> is<00:01:35.960> the<00:01:36.080> fifth

the with your first finger is the fifth

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:39.100 
the with your first finger is the fifth
fret<00:01:36.940> upstroke<00:01:37.970> whether<00:01:38.479> your<00:01:38.690> third<00:01:38.930> finger

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
fret upstroke whether your third finger

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.279 
fret upstroke whether your third finger
at<00:01:39.350> seven<00:01:39.820> I'm<00:01:40.820> in<00:01:41.030> down<00:01:41.240> stroke<00:01:41.570> with<00:01:42.259> your

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:42.289 
at seven I'm in down stroke with your

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:45.820 
at seven I'm in down stroke with your
pinky<00:01:42.680> at<00:01:42.799> the<00:01:42.890> 8th<00:01:43.039> and<00:01:43.759> then<00:01:44.560> over<00:01:45.560> to<00:01:45.710> the

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
pinky at the 8th and then over to the

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.679 
pinky at the 8th and then over to the
first<00:01:46.039> string<00:01:46.460> you're<00:01:47.090> going<00:01:47.240> to<00:01:47.299> do<00:01:47.390> the<00:01:47.509> same

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
first string you're going to do the same

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:50.920 
first string you're going to do the same
thing<00:01:47.990> in<00:01:48.140> the<00:01:48.369> in<00:01:49.369> the<00:01:49.610> left<00:01:50.030> hand<00:01:50.360> but<00:01:50.810> the

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
thing in the in the left hand but the

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.809 
thing in the in the left hand but the
right<00:01:51.140> hand<00:01:51.439> is<00:01:51.619> going<00:01:51.979> to<00:01:52.189> now<00:01:52.340> start<00:01:52.580> with<00:01:52.729> an

00:01:52.809 --> 00:01:52.819 
right hand is going to now start with an

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:55.120 
right hand is going to now start with an
upstroke<00:01:53.530> then<00:01:54.530> a<00:01:54.560> down

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
upstroke then a down

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.850 
upstroke then a down
then<00:01:55.850> an<00:01:55.940> up<00:01:56.119> so<00:01:57.080> you'll<00:01:57.229> see<00:01:57.350> that<00:01:57.500> what<00:01:57.679> that

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
then an up so you'll see that what that

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.620 
then an up so you'll see that what that
keeps<00:01:58.159> us<00:01:58.340> complete<00:01:58.729> alternate<00:01:59.149> picking<00:01:59.330> by

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
keeps us complete alternate picking by

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:09.430 
keeps us complete alternate picking by
going<00:02:02.799> down<00:02:03.799> up<00:02:04.280> down<00:02:05.179> up<00:02:05.679> down<00:02:06.679> up<00:02:07.929> okay<00:02:08.929> so

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
going down up down up down up okay so

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.140 
going down up down up down up okay so
now<00:02:09.739> that<00:02:09.769> should<00:02:10.160> be<00:02:10.190> a<00:02:10.280> repetitive<00:02:10.610> exercise

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
now that should be a repetitive exercise

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:20.640 
now that should be a repetitive exercise
so<00:02:11.420> you<00:02:11.480> should<00:02:11.630> be<00:02:11.720> playing<00:02:11.900> it<00:02:12.049> like<00:02:12.170> this

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.410 

and<00:02:21.650> then<00:02:21.830> you<00:02:22.010> can<00:02:22.160> finally<00:02:22.370> it<00:02:22.580> slowly<00:02:22.910> built

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
and then you can finally it slowly built

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:37.420 
and then you can finally it slowly built
speed<00:02:23.690> into<00:02:23.990> it

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.770 

and<00:02:38.430> then<00:02:38.610> it's<00:02:39.060> a<00:02:39.150> good<00:02:39.300> idea<00:02:39.390> to<00:02:39.600> start

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
and then it's a good idea to start

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.600 
and then it's a good idea to start
taking<00:02:39.990> it<00:02:40.200> across<00:02:40.320> the<00:02:40.680> form<00:02:40.950> so<00:02:41.130> do<00:02:41.280> it<00:02:41.310> a<00:02:41.460> few

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
taking it across the form so do it a few

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.270 
taking it across the form so do it a few
times<00:02:41.880> like<00:02:42.570> twice<00:02:42.990> on<00:02:43.200> each<00:02:43.230> one<00:02:43.590> and<00:02:43.800> then

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
times like twice on each one and then

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.280 
times like twice on each one and then
when<00:02:44.670> we<00:02:44.760> move<00:02:44.940> it<00:02:45.060> down<00:02:45.270> we<00:02:45.840> just<00:02:46.080> follow

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
when we move it down we just follow

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.680 
when we move it down we just follow
those<00:02:46.590> fingerings<00:02:47.070> but<00:02:47.760> just<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.480> same

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
those fingerings but just the same

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.570 
those fingerings but just the same
pattern

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.130 

all<00:02:53.360> those<00:02:53.570> two<00:02:53.750> strings<00:02:54.020> and<00:02:54.260> these<00:02:54.410> two

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
all those two strings and these two

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:02.670 
all those two strings and these two
then<00:02:56.710> these<00:02:56.920> two<00:02:57.930> and<00:02:58.930> then<00:02:59.020> elastic<00:03:01.500> so<00:03:02.500> we'll

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
then these two and then elastic so we'll

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:18.500 
then these two and then elastic so we'll
have<00:03:02.800> like<00:03:02.950> something<00:03:03.220> like<00:03:03.340> this

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.180 

so<00:03:19.510> you<00:03:19.630> can<00:03:19.900> really<00:03:20.440> do<00:03:20.650> that<00:03:20.680> and<00:03:20.950> build<00:03:21.070> up

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
so you can really do that and build up

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:31.430 
so you can really do that and build up
some<00:03:21.220> speed

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.440 

okay<00:03:32.440> now<00:03:32.740> let's<00:03:32.890> go<00:03:32.980> on<00:03:33.130> to<00:03:33.300> exercise<00:03:34.300> number

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
okay now let's go on to exercise number

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.990 
okay now let's go on to exercise number
two<00:03:34.750> it<00:03:35.220> starts<00:03:36.220> kind<00:03:36.400> of<00:03:36.520> with<00:03:36.670> the<00:03:36.790> same

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
two it starts kind of with the same

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.610 
two it starts kind of with the same
thing<00:03:37.300> five<00:03:37.570> seven<00:03:37.990> eight<00:03:38.080> on<00:03:38.200> the<00:03:38.290> second

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
thing five seven eight on the second

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.560 
thing five seven eight on the second
string<00:03:40.950> then<00:03:41.950> we<00:03:42.400> go<00:03:42.520> over<00:03:42.850> and<00:03:42.880> just<00:03:43.210> hit<00:03:43.390> an

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
string then we go over and just hit an

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.750 
string then we go over and just hit an
upstroke<00:03:44.080> on<00:03:44.260> the<00:03:44.350> five<00:03:44.590> and<00:03:45.010> then<00:03:45.550> come<00:03:45.730> back

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
upstroke on the five and then come back

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.020 
upstroke on the five and then come back
down<00:03:46.950> to<00:03:47.950> the<00:03:48.070> eighth<00:03:48.220> on<00:03:48.459> the<00:03:48.490> seventh<00:03:48.940> of<00:03:49.000> the

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
down to the eighth on the seventh of the

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.140 
down to the eighth on the seventh of the
second<00:03:49.360> string<00:03:49.560> then<00:03:50.560> the<00:03:50.590> seven<00:03:51.040> that's<00:03:51.910> kind

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
second string then the seven that's kind

00:03:52.150 --> 00:04:01.700 
second string then the seven that's kind
of<00:03:52.180> a<00:03:52.240> little<00:03:52.390> Paul<00:03:52.870> Gill<00:03:53.110> bullet

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:01.710 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.750 

we're<00:04:02.710> going<00:04:02.830> to<00:04:02.890> put<00:04:03.010> a<00:04:03.040> little<00:04:03.220> extension<00:04:03.580> on

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
we're going to put a little extension on

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.970 
we're going to put a little extension on
that<00:04:03.940> we're<00:04:04.150> going<00:04:04.240> to<00:04:04.300> do<00:04:04.420> that<00:04:04.600> lick<00:04:04.980> and

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
that we're going to do that lick and

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.610 
that we're going to do that lick and
then<00:04:06.180> do<00:04:07.180> the<00:04:07.300> one<00:04:07.450> from<00:04:07.600> exercise<00:04:07.960> one<00:04:08.260> after

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
then do the one from exercise one after

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.330 
then do the one from exercise one after
it<00:04:09.900> so<00:04:10.900> kind<00:04:11.050> of<00:04:11.170> extend<00:04:11.560> it<00:04:11.680> so<00:04:11.860> we<00:04:12.010> got<00:04:12.160> this

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
it so kind of extend it so we got this

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.640 
it so kind of extend it so we got this
now

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.340 

so<00:04:16.650> we<00:04:16.740> got<00:04:16.860> down<00:04:17.160> up<00:04:17.580> down<00:04:17.970> up<00:04:18.390> down<00:04:18.420> up<00:04:19.140> down

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
so we got down up down up down up down

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:31.500 
so we got down up down up down up down
up<00:04:19.800> down<00:04:20.040> up<00:04:20.459> down<00:04:20.520> up

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:50.790 

and<00:04:32.080> you<00:04:32.380> take<00:04:32.560> that<00:04:32.680> across<00:04:32.860> the<00:04:33.070> farms<00:04:49.800> okay

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
and you take that across the farms okay

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.710 
and you take that across the farms okay
let's<00:04:51.430> go<00:04:51.550> to<00:04:51.670> exercise<00:04:52.060> number<00:04:52.330> three<00:04:52.540> this

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
let's go to exercise number three this

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.050 
let's go to exercise number three this
is<00:04:52.780> only<00:04:53.080> a<00:04:53.230> one<00:04:53.530> string<00:04:53.860> pattern<00:04:54.250> and<00:04:54.460> it's<00:04:54.910> in

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
is only a one string pattern and it's in

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.660 
is only a one string pattern and it's in
four<00:04:55.390> is<00:04:55.570> not<00:04:55.720> sixes<00:04:56.290> this<00:04:56.920> is<00:04:57.100> kind<00:04:57.310> of<00:04:57.430> real

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:57.670 
four is not sixes this is kind of real

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:59.490 
four is not sixes this is kind of real
reminiscent<00:04:58.270> of<00:04:58.330> what<00:04:58.510> /<00:04:58.810> -<00:04:58.840> Chi<00:04:59.140> does<00:04:59.320> this

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
reminiscent of what / - Chi does this

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.300 
reminiscent of what / - Chi does this
lick<00:04:59.800> a<00:04:59.830> lot

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
lick a lot

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.160 
lick a lot

Sean / - you have dreams either so it
just<00:05:02.890> starts<00:05:03.220> you<00:05:03.790> still<00:05:04.060> want<00:05:04.240> to<00:05:04.270> use<00:05:04.330> the

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:04.510 
just starts you still want to use the

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:05.850 
just starts you still want to use the
same<00:05:04.720> three<00:05:05.200> strings<00:05:05.440> but<00:05:05.560> you're<00:05:05.680> going<00:05:05.800> to

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
same three strings but you're going to

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.290 
same three strings but you're going to
start<00:05:06.130> on<00:05:06.280> the<00:05:06.400> one<00:05:06.610> in<00:05:06.850> the<00:05:07.390> middle<00:05:07.750> and<00:05:08.220> pick

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
start on the one in the middle and pick

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.070 
start on the one in the middle and pick
the<00:05:10.300> seven<00:05:10.720> first<00:05:11.640> then<00:05:12.640> eight<00:05:12.910> then<00:05:13.240> back

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
the seven first then eight then back

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.980 
the seven first then eight then back
down<00:05:14.110> to<00:05:14.380> seven<00:05:14.740> then<00:05:15.700> five<00:05:15.810> that's<00:05:16.810> the

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
down to seven then five that's the

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.450 
down to seven then five that's the
complete<00:05:17.380> pattern<00:05:17.560> so<00:05:17.860> we<00:05:17.950> have<00:05:18.070> this<00:05:18.370> town<00:05:19.380> up

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
complete pattern so we have this town up

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.170 
complete pattern so we have this town up
down<00:05:21.460> up<00:05:22.560> so<00:05:23.560> we<00:05:23.920> play<00:05:24.100> that<00:05:24.280> back<00:05:24.490> to<00:05:24.670> like

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
down up so we play that back to like

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:30.000 
down up so we play that back to like
four<00:05:25.420> times<00:05:25.570> in<00:05:25.780> a<00:05:25.810> row<00:05:28.620> you<00:05:29.620> see<00:05:29.650> how<00:05:29.830> I'm

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.010 
four times in a row you see how I'm

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:33.440 
four times in a row you see how I'm
exiting<00:05:30.550> that<00:05:30.700> first<00:05:30.940> one

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:33.450 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:35.960 

that's<00:05:34.050> something<00:05:34.440> he<00:05:34.500> does<00:05:34.650> a<00:05:34.680> lot<00:05:34.890> to<00:05:34.970> help

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:35.970 
that's something he does a lot to help

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.420 
that's something he does a lot to help
you<00:05:36.060> find<00:05:36.330> the<00:05:36.510> beat<00:05:36.690> so<00:05:37.320> you<00:05:37.980> can<00:05:38.130> just<00:05:38.280> do

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
you find the beat so you can just do

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:39.740 
you find the beat so you can just do
that<00:05:38.580> in<00:05:38.730> succession<00:05:39.120> and<00:05:39.420> then<00:05:39.510> take<00:05:39.720> it

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
that in succession and then take it

00:05:39.750 --> 00:06:00.560 
that in succession and then take it
across<00:05:40.050> the<00:05:40.230> strings<00:05:58.520> okay<00:05:59.520> now<00:06:00.270> let's<00:06:00.450> get<00:06:00.510> to

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:00.570 
across the strings okay now let's get to

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:01.670 
across the strings okay now let's get to
the<00:06:00.660> last<00:06:00.840> one<00:06:01.020> this<00:06:01.110> last<00:06:01.290> one's<00:06:01.530> a<00:06:01.590> little

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 
the last one this last one's a little

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.590 
the last one this last one's a little
bit<00:06:01.860> more<00:06:01.890> disjointed<00:06:02.220> a<00:06:02.850> little<00:06:03.360> bit<00:06:03.450> more

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 
bit more disjointed a little bit more

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.020 
bit more disjointed a little bit more
difficult<00:06:04.110> and<00:06:04.290> we're<00:06:04.740> going<00:06:04.860> to<00:06:04.890> be<00:06:05.040> starting

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:06.030 
difficult and we're going to be starting

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:07.850 
difficult and we're going to be starting
in<00:06:06.270> this<00:06:06.420> the<00:06:06.900> third<00:06:07.170> and<00:06:07.440> this<00:06:07.560> is<00:06:07.680> going<00:06:07.800> to

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860 
in this the third and this is going to

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.920 
in this the third and this is going to
be<00:06:07.980> in<00:06:08.070> sixes<00:06:08.430> again<00:06:08.760> but<00:06:09.480> this<00:06:09.600> is<00:06:09.750> going<00:06:09.840> to

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930 
be in sixes again but this is going to

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:11.240 
be in sixes again but this is going to
kind<00:06:10.110> of<00:06:10.170> come<00:06:10.350> across<00:06:10.440> strings<00:06:10.950> and<00:06:11.160> make

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:11.250 
kind of come across strings and make

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:12.830 
kind of come across strings and make
your<00:06:11.370> fingers<00:06:11.640> do<00:06:11.760> some<00:06:11.970> weird<00:06:12.180> combinations

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:12.840 
your fingers do some weird combinations

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.320 
your fingers do some weird combinations
so<00:06:13.080> this<00:06:13.830> is<00:06:13.980> getting<00:06:14.730> slightly<00:06:15.150> more

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:15.330 
so this is getting slightly more

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:16.580 
so this is getting slightly more
difficult<00:06:15.420> not<00:06:15.840> everything<00:06:16.170> is<00:06:16.260> in<00:06:16.350> a<00:06:16.410> row

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:16.590 
difficult not everything is in a row

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:18.620 
difficult not everything is in a row
anymore<00:06:16.830> we're<00:06:17.790> going<00:06:17.910> to<00:06:17.970> start<00:06:18.300> and<00:06:18.540> you

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:18.630 
anymore we're going to start and you

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.000 
anymore we're going to start and you
have<00:06:18.750> to<00:06:18.840> cross<00:06:19.050> strings<00:06:19.410> more<00:06:19.620> on<00:06:19.740> this<00:06:19.860> one

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.010 
have to cross strings more on this one

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:23.450 
have to cross strings more on this one
too<00:06:20.160> so<00:06:20.270> that's<00:06:21.270> also<00:06:22.230> really<00:06:22.710> adds<00:06:22.950> to<00:06:23.190> the

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460 
too so that's also really adds to the

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:24.950 
too so that's also really adds to the
difficulty<00:06:23.880> we're<00:06:24.450> going<00:06:24.570> to<00:06:24.630> start<00:06:24.810> with<00:06:24.870> a

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:24.960 
difficulty we're going to start with a

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.230 
difficulty we're going to start with a
Down<00:06:25.140> stroke<00:06:25.440> on<00:06:25.620> the<00:06:25.710> seven<00:06:26.070> on<00:06:26.880> the<00:06:27.030> first

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:27.240 
Down stroke on the seven on the first

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.380 
Down stroke on the seven on the first
string<00:06:27.480> then<00:06:28.050> five<00:06:28.350> on<00:06:28.680> the<00:06:28.740> first<00:06:28.950> string<00:06:29.130> and

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:29.390 
string then five on the first string and

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:34.640 
string then five on the first string and
then<00:06:30.390> eight<00:06:30.660> then<00:06:31.640> go<00:06:32.640> back<00:06:32.910> to<00:06:32.940> the<00:06:33.270> five<00:06:33.650> so

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:34.650 
then eight then go back to the five so

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:37.940 
then eight then go back to the five so
we<00:06:34.740> had<00:06:34.830> a<00:06:34.860> little<00:06:36.200> B<00:06:37.200> coming<00:06:37.410> across<00:06:37.650> and

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:37.950 
we had a little B coming across and

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:39.380 
we had a little B coming across and
strings<00:06:38.220> a<00:06:38.310> lot<00:06:38.460> there<00:06:38.700> then<00:06:39.060> you<00:06:39.180> come<00:06:39.360> back

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:39.390 
strings a lot there then you come back

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:42.230 
strings a lot there then you come back
down<00:06:39.660> to<00:06:39.900> the<00:06:40.020> second<00:06:40.530> and<00:06:40.740> play<00:06:41.370> the<00:06:41.580> last<00:06:41.790> two

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240 
down to the second and play the last two

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.070 
down to the second and play the last two
notes

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:44.080 
notes

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.840 
notes
on<00:06:44.530> the<00:06:44.620> way<00:06:44.740> down<00:06:44.770> with<00:06:45.220> that<00:06:45.340> string<00:06:45.610> so<00:06:45.639> we

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:45.850 
on the way down with that string so we

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:56.629 
on the way down with that string so we
have

00:06:56.629 --> 00:06:56.639 

00:06:56.639 --> 00:06:59.279 

and<00:06:57.639> then<00:06:58.539> you<00:06:58.629> have<00:06:58.750> to<00:06:58.840> trace<00:06:59.110> the

00:06:59.279 --> 00:06:59.289 
and then you have to trace the

00:06:59.289 --> 00:07:01.200 
and then you have to trace the
fingerings<00:06:59.740> on<00:06:59.919> the<00:07:00.009> way<00:07:00.129> down<00:07:00.370> this<00:07:00.909> string

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:01.210 
fingerings on the way down this string

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:07.980 
fingerings on the way down this string
is<00:07:01.270> going<00:07:01.360> to<00:07:01.419> be<00:07:03.270> seven<00:07:04.270> five<00:07:06.330> and<00:07:07.330> then<00:07:07.569> seven

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:07.990 
is going to be seven five and then seven

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:22.480 
is going to be seven five and then seven
in<00:07:08.139> the<00:07:08.259> back<00:07:08.469> and<00:07:08.919> then<00:07:10.680> five<00:07:11.680> four

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:22.490 

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:25.879 

okay<00:07:23.520> so<00:07:24.180> take<00:07:24.389> these<00:07:24.539> exercises<00:07:25.319> start<00:07:25.710> them

00:07:25.879 --> 00:07:25.889 
okay so take these exercises start them

00:07:25.889 --> 00:07:28.730 
okay so take these exercises start them

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:28.740 
slow use a metronome on the beats follow

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.350 
slow use a metronome on the beats follow
the<00:07:28.949> rhythms<00:07:29.250> and<00:07:29.370> the<00:07:29.490> exercises<00:07:29.910> that<00:07:30.210> we're

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:30.360 
the rhythms and the exercises that we're

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.640 
the rhythms and the exercises that we're
going<00:07:30.479> to<00:07:30.539> keep<00:07:30.690> going<00:07:30.750> with<00:07:31.169> this<00:07:31.319> a<00:07:31.440> little

bit these make for great warm-ups great

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:36.800 
bit these make for great warm-ups great
technique<00:07:34.979> exercises<00:07:35.520> or<00:07:36.270> whatever<00:07:36.569> we're

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:36.810 
technique exercises or whatever we're

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:39.860 
technique exercises or whatever we're
just<00:07:36.960> trying<00:07:37.110> to<00:07:37.169> get<00:07:37.289> your<00:07:37.410> hands<00:07:37.680> down<00:07:38.870> to

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:39.870 
just trying to get your hands down to

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:41.779 
just trying to get your hands down to
play<00:07:40.080> in<00:07:40.139> these<00:07:40.380> in<00:07:40.680> a<00:07:41.130> very<00:07:41.310> comfortable

00:07:41.779 --> 00:07:41.789 
play in these in a very comfortable

00:07:41.789 --> 00:07:44.230 
play in these in a very comfortable
manner<00:07:42.000> so<00:07:42.630> when<00:07:42.780> we<00:07:42.900> start<00:07:43.319> taking<00:07:43.470> it<00:07:43.770> to<00:07:43.889> the

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:44.240 
manner so when we start taking it to the

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.390 
manner so when we start taking it to the
to<00:07:45.240> the<00:07:45.330> keys<00:07:45.599> and<00:07:45.930> everything<00:07:46.400> everything

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:47.400 
to the keys and everything everything

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.029 
to the keys and everything everything
feels<00:07:47.970> very<00:07:48.060> comfortable<00:07:48.389> to<00:07:48.780> you<00:07:48.900> okay<00:07:49.380> so

00:07:50.029 --> 00:07:50.039 
feels very comfortable to you okay so

00:07:50.039 --> 00:07:51.770 
feels very comfortable to you okay so
try<00:07:50.580> to<00:07:50.610> maybe<00:07:50.849> practice<00:07:51.060> this<00:07:51.360> with<00:07:51.509> a<00:07:51.539> clean

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:51.780 
try to maybe practice this with a clean

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:54.499 
try to maybe practice this with a clean
tone<00:07:51.990> too<00:07:52.199> and<00:07:52.800> try<00:07:52.979> not<00:07:53.099> to<00:07:53.159> hide<00:07:53.909> behind<00:07:54.120> a

00:07:54.499 --> 00:07:54.509 
tone too and try not to hide behind a

00:07:54.509 --> 00:07:57.170 
tone too and try not to hide behind a
distortion<00:07:55.409> tone<00:07:55.680> all<00:07:55.830> the<00:07:55.919> time<00:07:56.099> okay<00:07:56.580> talk

00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:57.180 
distortion tone all the time okay talk
