00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.980

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.029
 so after a period of no opinion 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:28.270
 About books I was here for you. 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:30.759
 This is a book I read last year in 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.290
 truth in December but since then I 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:34.030
 I was anxious and curious to 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.180
 share with you what I found 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:40.870
 his bill was released by the publisher 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:44.739
 This is a great edition. 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:46.960
 cover and was written by two authors 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:49.989
 but are not any two authors I 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.120
 I'm talking about bad play and rita. 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:55.290
 the two authors are being super 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:58.780
 are already having a legion of fans 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.760
 and this is the first book that is 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.370
 reading both of the game while 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.710
 fullerton I chose this book for 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.979
 get amboim milk mainly 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.530
 because it is because of the theme that he 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:13.060
 proposed is according to the synopsis and 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.869
 some drawings I had ever seen 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.100
 before 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:21.340
 well while a bad one writes about a 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.560
 character named ibrahim letter sound 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.560
 write about the character too 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.170
 called wilson and he intercalates the 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.990
 chapters of the book then the first and 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.410
 presented to us is the ideal're bad 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:39.039
 and heard from a green 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:42.060
 how can I say it 's rather unsalted 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:44.140
 I can not say and if you will repair 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.479
 that this book has left me somewhat 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.759
 confused and that's why it was so 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.819
 eager to share with you and 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:54.399
 know what you think of him too 

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:57.310
 It left a little confusing for me. 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:59.080
 full of ups and downs in fact had the 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.940
 who thought he was phenomenal could not 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.869
 stop reading and had time to 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:08.200
 just me who else is going on there 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:11.349
 the car then the rildo of bad is to stay in 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.310
 However without salt not so 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:14.739
 can get more 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.050
 of his own life can not do 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:20.230
 his own choices because he picks up and 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.480
 mainly the consequences not 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:26.650
 so he stays there with the costume is 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:29.590
 extra figurine of the book than 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:33.099
 Your best friend is Tallinn. 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:36.610
 cup coop is the character in this book 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:40.510
 here is the most charismatic character 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.920
 But I could feel empathy like this. 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.540
 You know that character you want. 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.430
 know in real life that character 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.069
 Can you understand some 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.410
 feelings right you see there 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:52.330
 that in that scene and everything and 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:57.160
 santarém cup 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:03:00.160
 only that it falls cup is a giant being and 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:03.940
 super high super wide player 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.840
 American football is extrovert and yesterday 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.760
 sexual 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.269
 He is the best friend of this humble man. 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:13.090
 green that is heterosexual and reserved there 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:14.769
 in his own right as I said this 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.489
 Friendship is very interesting, it's cool. 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:20.500
 this relationship is how they 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:24.070
 They got tatá and they're teenagers. 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:26.019
 then at the school where they got such 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.810
 sexuality in that 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:33.459
 No, the characters are involved. 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:35.680
 I thought it was cool, but it's one thing. 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:38.170
 from shoulder to always irritated me 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.810
 his writing was in the description of the team 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:44.170
 occupy the whole time I think every 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:46.840
 two pages of the chapters of the bad gift 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:50.639
 he gets discovered taiko for the guy 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:54.760
 Chicao extrovert of fumbling 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:58.000
 panic for a fun big man 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.950
 No one leaves people, I already understand what he 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.379
 was great says b 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:05.439
 Just so I got a little annoyed with 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:06.430
 This is even worried that you wanted to read it. 

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:08.709
 very 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.989
 this book because she was furious when 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.940
 he saw the approach is precisely this 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:15.579
 homosexuality in a way that 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.440
 popular for teenagers and they 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:19.690
 I think there has to be more literature 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.699
 about this very popular 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:25.389
 I think this theme has to be dealt with 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:28.600
 one way and the other people 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:31.330
 able to connect with these 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:34.449
 characters know is to understand 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:37.150
 better to talk with some ideas and 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:39.270
 ridiculous things that people listen to and 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:42.520
 what is expected and cylinder and 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:46.270
 I found in São Paulo going from a 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:49.060
 light tone it's a bit more down 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:51.610
 well down writing to stand up 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.490
 problems here is a little heavier 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.990
 more dense compared to that of amboim 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:59.470
 especially I do not know if she 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:02.949
 also because he will be a boy 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:06.280
 very depressed and I remain disgusted with 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:10.270
 antisocial and setra and also was 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:15.340
 homosexual and then none of the 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:17.770
 two rivers I found charismatic at last 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:21.849
 I could not feel empathy for part 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:24.550
 neither one but it's got one thing 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:28.180
 interesting from the chapters of the athlete 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:31.120
 I do not know if you 'll see more. 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:34.060
 their chapters with him begin with 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:37.180
 lowercase letters and proper names 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:39.940
 also add Hindu cross ie they have no 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:42.190
 uppercase letters in the book chapter and 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:46.780
 around at least most chapters 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:49.300
 well in the book trade is somewhat confusing 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:52.960
 You stay without losing , in fact. 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:55.680
 proposed by two authors but 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:58.330
 of these two the river in a situation somewhat 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.970
 dramatic and from that meeting you 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:02.740
 read the answers to 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:04.599
 some things they described the 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:07.270
 beginning for me seemed a bit of 

00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:09.039
 connecta opinion a little and felt good 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:12.190
 in the end we will have some 

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:14.770
 answers that were a good part of 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:17.020
 nice reading I gotta be 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:19.509
 in some mattresses and sensational who 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:22.270
 that I found at least some lessons 

00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:24.129
 It's even a book that I point out is a 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:26.319
 book that is good 

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:28.479
 while cast three stars as good 

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:30.879
 because in fact I was in doubt that 

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:33.039
 the ups and downs of most important is 

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:36.280
 that the moral of the story at least 

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:38.139
 me in this limbo was the relationship ne 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.490
 What you can get out of a 

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:42.460
 relationship that the past 

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:44.919
 highlight in a relationship as one 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:47.440
 friendship relationship between friends 

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:50.259
 when the love relationship that the 

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:54.039
 most important of these relationships is 

00:06:50.259 --> 00:06:56.289
 in fact the experience gained is the 

00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:59.949
 growth is what you 

00:06:56.289 --> 00:07:03.400
 learns from one another is the 

00:06:59.949 --> 00:07:07.650
 exchange is made much more important than 

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:10.569
 which is the sexual context and a context 

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:13.750
 romantic thing indeed 

00:07:10.569 --> 00:07:17.020
 keep an eye on that basis so that 

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:20.020
 new edition will the name a destination of 

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:22.930
 john green and baffle and please who 

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:25.270
 I already told anyone who is reading all good 

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:27.190
 exchange experience with me because if 

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:30.580
 I thought you found it confusing too. 

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:32.529
 time these ups and downs or is 

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:34.690
 really because I might have 

00:07:32.529 --> 00:07:37.060
 adapting to this new plantar genus 

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:38.820
 now entering this world and maybe 

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:41.550
 maybe a little disjointed 

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:46.950
 Who liked it so far did not come here. 

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:51.530
 must run away with marcinho and until the next 

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:51.530
 but does not like obvious crosses 

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:56.420
 the middle 

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:02.150
 nobody
