00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
a little bit too long but I think you

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.940 
a little bit too long but I think you
guys<00:01:36.270> get<00:01:36.540> what<00:01:36.720> I'm<00:01:36.810> driving<00:01:37.140> at<00:01:37.530> some<00:01:37.829> of

these<00:01:38.040> tracks<00:01:38.369> they<00:01:38.850> feel<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.150> little<00:01:39.479> bit

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
these tracks they feel a little bit

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.710 
these tracks they feel a little bit
fresher<00:01:40.020> than<00:01:40.680> others<00:01:41.189> in<00:01:41.430> fact<00:01:41.939> this<00:01:42.329> album

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
fresher than others in fact this album

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.569 
fresher than others in fact this album
does<00:01:42.869> feel<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.110> little<00:01:43.259> bit<00:01:43.649> dated<00:01:44.009> in<00:01:44.310> some

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
does feel a little bit dated in some

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.730 
does feel a little bit dated in some
ways<00:01:44.790> your<00:01:45.270> body<00:01:45.479> is<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.780> weapon<00:01:46.200> was<00:01:46.380> released

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
ways your body is a weapon was released

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.550 
ways your body is a weapon was released
as<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:46.979> single<00:01:47.220> in<00:01:47.689> 2013<00:01:48.689> definitely<00:01:49.290> one<00:01:49.409> of<00:01:49.500> my

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
as a single in 2013 definitely one of my

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.319 
as a single in 2013 definitely one of my
favorites<00:01:49.920> on<00:01:50.040> this<00:01:50.430> record<00:01:50.790> but<00:01:51.000> does<00:01:51.180> it

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
favorites on this record but does it

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.289 
favorites on this record but does it
necessarily<00:01:51.509> find<00:01:52.439> its<00:01:52.680> spot<00:01:53.100> at<00:01:53.340> home<00:01:53.790> here

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
necessarily find its spot at home here

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.660 
necessarily find its spot at home here
on<00:01:54.509> glitterbug<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.290> don't<00:01:55.740> really<00:01:55.860> think<00:01:55.950> so<00:01:56.460> it

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
on glitterbug I don't really think so it

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.100 
on glitterbug I don't really think so it
just<00:01:56.850> seems<00:01:57.060> like<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:57.420> was<00:01:57.509> included<00:01:57.990> because

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
just seems like it was included because

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.920 
just seems like it was included because
they<00:01:58.710> released<00:01:59.159> it<00:01:59.369> and<00:01:59.549> then<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.270> album<00:02:00.659> took

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
they released it and then the album took

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.319 
they released it and then the album took
almost<00:02:01.560> another<00:02:01.829> year<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:02.340> a<00:02:02.430> half<00:02:02.670> from<00:02:03.090> that

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
almost another year and a half from that

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.389 
almost another year and a half from that
point<00:02:03.719> of<00:02:03.990> release<00:02:04.350> there's<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.130> vein

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
point of release there's a vein

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.100 
point of release there's a vein
connecting<00:02:06.030> all<00:02:06.180> of<00:02:06.210> these<00:02:06.479> tracks<00:02:06.810> like

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
connecting all of these tracks like

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.419 
connecting all of these tracks like
they're<00:02:07.259> all<00:02:07.380> meeting<00:02:07.860> somewhere<00:02:08.250> in<00:02:08.310> the

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
they're all meeting somewhere in the

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.669 
they're all meeting somewhere in the
same<00:02:08.759> creative<00:02:09.209> space<00:02:09.569> at<00:02:09.780> least<00:02:09.810> tracks<00:02:10.319> 1

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
same creative space at least tracks 1

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.950 
same creative space at least tracks 1
through<00:02:10.920> 6<00:02:11.280> in<00:02:11.489> concluding<00:02:11.879> what<00:02:12.150> this<00:02:12.330> is<00:02:12.510> not

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
through 6 in concluding what this is not

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.690 
through 6 in concluding what this is not
party<00:02:13.260> that<00:02:13.500> one's<00:02:13.710> definitely<00:02:13.950> more<00:02:14.370> synth

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
party that one's definitely more synth

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.130 
party that one's definitely more synth
driven<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:15.180> then<00:02:15.270> we<00:02:15.360> get<00:02:15.510> a<00:02:15.570> little<00:02:15.750> bit<00:02:15.930> more

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
driven and then we get a little bit more

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.890 
driven and then we get a little bit more
out<00:02:16.590> of<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.890> box<00:02:17.160> with<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.730> track<00:02:18.030> Isabel

out of the box with the track Isabel

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.140 
out of the box with the track Isabel
definitely<00:02:19.320> kind<00:02:19.950> of<00:02:19.980> a<00:02:20.100> ballad<00:02:20.520> style<00:02:20.730> track

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
definitely kind of a ballad style track

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.660 
definitely kind of a ballad style track
and<00:02:21.360> dedicated<00:02:22.050> to<00:02:22.230> this<00:02:22.500> girl<00:02:22.740> named<00:02:23.010> Isabel

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
and dedicated to this girl named Isabel

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.570 
and dedicated to this girl named Isabel
obviously<00:02:24.420> it's<00:02:24.810> one<00:02:25.170> that<00:02:25.410> did<00:02:25.920> not<00:02:26.130> really

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
obviously it's one that did not really

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.090 
obviously it's one that did not really
sink<00:02:27.060> in<00:02:27.300> until<00:02:27.330> probably<00:02:28.110> about<00:02:28.410> the<00:02:28.740> fifth

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
sink in until probably about the fifth

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.250 
sink in until probably about the fifth
listen<00:02:29.700> for<00:02:29.940> me<00:02:30.060> at<00:02:30.270> first<00:02:30.570> this<00:02:30.870> track<00:02:31.110> was

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
listen for me at first this track was

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.320 
listen for me at first this track was
kind<00:02:31.560> of<00:02:31.650> off-putting<00:02:31.920> did<00:02:32.670> not<00:02:32.820> care<00:02:33.090> for<00:02:33.120> the

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
kind of off-putting did not care for the

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.850 
kind of off-putting did not care for the
lead<00:02:33.480> singers<00:02:33.780> vocals<00:02:34.260> here<00:02:34.410> on<00:02:34.530> this<00:02:34.680> one

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
lead singers vocals here on this one

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.980 
lead singers vocals here on this one
felt<00:02:35.310> like<00:02:35.460> he<00:02:35.610> was<00:02:35.730> just<00:02:35.760> forcing<00:02:36.450> it<00:02:36.600> it<00:02:36.750> felt

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
felt like he was just forcing it it felt

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.450 
felt like he was just forcing it it felt
a<00:02:37.080> little<00:02:37.170> bit<00:02:37.350> contrived<00:02:37.800> and<00:02:38.130> I<00:02:38.190> was<00:02:38.310> just

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
a little bit contrived and I was just

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:39.890 
a little bit contrived and I was just
like<00:02:38.610> ah<00:02:38.850> seriously

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
like ah seriously

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.530 
like ah seriously
but<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.320> more<00:02:40.590> I<00:02:40.860> hear<00:02:41.520> it<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:42.240> light

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
but the more I hear it the light

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.540 
but the more I hear it the light
instrumental<00:02:43.110> that<00:02:43.620> fits<00:02:43.890> along<00:02:44.070> with<00:02:44.370> this

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
instrumental that fits along with this

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.570 
instrumental that fits along with this
song<00:02:44.820> does<00:02:45.690> kind<00:02:46.320> of<00:02:46.380> make<00:02:46.500> me<00:02:46.560> warm<00:02:47.010> up<00:02:47.190> to<00:02:47.460> it

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
song does kind of make me warm up to it

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.910 
song does kind of make me warm up to it
it<00:02:47.670> makes<00:02:47.820> me<00:02:48.030> at<00:02:48.150> least<00:02:48.420> want<00:02:48.960> to<00:02:49.140> try<00:02:49.500> and

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
it makes me at least want to try and

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.130 
it makes me at least want to try and
like<00:02:50.190> this<00:02:50.430> thing<00:02:50.750> unfortunately<00:02:51.750> that<00:02:51.900> track

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
like this thing unfortunately that track

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.750 
like this thing unfortunately that track
is<00:02:52.320> still<00:02:52.560> among<00:02:52.740> my<00:02:52.920> least<00:02:53.130> favorites<00:02:53.550> along

is still among my least favorites along

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.460 
is still among my least favorites along
with<00:02:53.910> the<00:02:54.000> closer<00:02:54.240> curveballs<00:02:54.960> and<00:02:55.260> then<00:02:55.380> of

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
with the closer curveballs and then of

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.830 
with the closer curveballs and then of
course<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:55.830> track<00:02:56.070> headspace<00:02:56.730> which<00:02:57.150> is<00:02:57.390> one

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
course the track headspace which is one

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.210 
course the track headspace which is one
of<00:02:57.870> those<00:02:58.020> ones<00:02:58.290> I<00:02:58.410> was<00:02:58.500> talking<00:02:58.830> about<00:02:58.890> and

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
of those ones I was talking about and

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.380 
of those ones I was talking about and
when<00:02:59.310> it<00:02:59.400> comes<00:02:59.520> to<00:02:59.730> the<00:02:59.820> lyrical<00:03:00.210> content

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
when it comes to the lyrical content

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.480 
when it comes to the lyrical content
that's<00:03:00.840> kind<00:03:01.050> of<00:03:01.080> a<00:03:01.200> downfall<00:03:01.470> for<00:03:02.040> me<00:03:02.190> it<00:03:02.430> just

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
that's kind of a downfall for me it just

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.820 
that's kind of a downfall for me it just
gets<00:03:02.850> a<00:03:02.940> little<00:03:03.090> bit<00:03:03.300> flat<00:03:03.720> and<00:03:04.080> lifeless<00:03:04.320> in

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
gets a little bit flat and lifeless in

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.710 
gets a little bit flat and lifeless in
terms<00:03:05.040> of<00:03:05.190> its<00:03:05.340> instrumental<00:03:05.940> as<00:03:06.090> well<00:03:06.360> it's

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
terms of its instrumental as well it's

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.330 
terms of its instrumental as well it's
like<00:03:06.900> I<00:03:07.020> was<00:03:07.140> talking<00:03:07.500> about<00:03:07.590> you<00:03:07.890> know<00:03:08.040> it's

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
like I was talking about you know it's

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.100 
like I was talking about you know it's

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
you bring something new to the table or

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.570 
you bring something new to the table or
you<00:03:10.170> bring<00:03:10.380> a<00:03:10.530> fresh<00:03:10.800> sound<00:03:11.130> at<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:11.490> beginning

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
you bring a fresh sound at the beginning

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:12.950 
you bring a fresh sound at the beginning
of<00:03:11.880> the<00:03:11.970> record<00:03:12.240> but<00:03:12.330> you<00:03:12.390> kind<00:03:12.720> of<00:03:12.750> keep

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 
of the record but you kind of keep

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.870 
of the record but you kind of keep
trying<00:03:13.680> to<00:03:13.830> emulate<00:03:14.250> that<00:03:14.400> throughout<00:03:14.760> the

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
trying to emulate that throughout the

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.940 
trying to emulate that throughout the
record<00:03:15.240> and<00:03:15.420> it<00:03:15.480> just<00:03:15.690> doesn't<00:03:15.960> really<00:03:16.530> have

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
record and it just doesn't really have

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.310 
record and it just doesn't really have
that<00:03:17.190> injection<00:03:17.640> of<00:03:17.940> life<00:03:18.210> that<00:03:18.630> it<00:03:19.020> needs

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
that injection of life that it needs

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.380 
that injection of life that it needs
from<00:03:19.650> track<00:03:19.890> to<00:03:19.920> track<00:03:20.100> the<00:03:20.550> Wombats<00:03:20.970> I<00:03:21.150> feel

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.350

might<00:04:26.220> be<00:04:26.310> the<00:04:26.460> one<00:04:26.610> that<00:04:26.760> takes<00:04:26.940> the<00:04:27.180> cake

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
might be the one that takes the cake

might be the one that takes the cake
