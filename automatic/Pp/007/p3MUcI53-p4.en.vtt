00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.410
 nej 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:07.999
 suddenly it is there 

00:00:07.999 --> 00:00:09.609
 this man 

00:00:09.609 --> 00:00:11.189
 this occupied 

00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:12.999
 this one will 

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:15.999
 and different 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.329
 Companies work 

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:24.219
 past the times we knew already here comes the aesthetic covenant 

00:00:24.219 --> 00:00:27.219
 tangible shorts 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:33.739
 who had hoped that what had been presented at the fashion shows for years 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.600
 Admittedly, being a catwalk guide is admittedly a sizable one 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.600
 he has to be very brave this summer 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.040
 That was about five years on 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.870
 and this summer explodes desperately and you have to have one 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.030
 Clearly, they could be staying in the next two or three years 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.120
 we men 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.600
 to see or see Leipzig for sport 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.140
 Lauren will not be reinforced by a real one 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.820
 The fashion shops offer pretty much every conceivable summer 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.050
 Creations at everything seems to be possible 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.040
 we are completely wild 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.040
 around ornaments wants to spot three quarters of 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.560
 However, by designers like Marc Checkbox then you then not synonymous 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.510
 can completely abdun 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.150
 around the one, they would be three quarters Sportster percent 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.160
 super-gau or menswear 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:36.150
 the supergau of menswear you can see these days quite often 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.420
 the street because 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.299
 May the charts that are so handy 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:42.490
 HBH 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.490
 how do you actually see them? 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.270
 St 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.950
 that is not meant evil but not continuation 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.100
 for the individual shorts for men the children a smile Tino 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.470
 dull 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.130
 would have 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.310
 So basically 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.190
 the test car could be big 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.000
 We were not complied with as an entertainer was overwhelmed because 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.950
 another analyst greasy continue APA I know that too 

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:17.149
 Neumarkt 

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:19.879
 big talent 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:25.959
 even an absolute logo Philipp Laux to better fit shorts is emphasized 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.290
 Schulte Chance will be clear Modric 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.510
 It is common with 6 11 recently still reality causes wear 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.619
 speaker 

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:39.669
 t-shirts Terrain Forts around and thus the most beautiful 

00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:43.139
 pull through that makes no sense whatsoever for pulp 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:48.230
 to combine a jacket that it is easier that is wrong 

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:53.549
 and who wants to do nothing wrong wearing t-shirt is best only there 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.389
 where they really get a grip
