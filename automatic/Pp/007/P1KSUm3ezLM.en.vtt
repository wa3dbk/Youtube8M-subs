Gameboy<00:01:03.220> light<00:01:03.520> you<00:01:04.000> know<00:01:04.119> I'm<00:01:04.270> a<00:01:04.300> big<00:01:04.630> fan<00:01:04.660> of

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:04.990

Gameboy light you know I'm a big fan of
the<00:01:05.290> AAA<00:01:07.110> flip<00:01:08.110> it<00:01:08.259> back<00:01:08.410> over<00:01:08.440> and<00:01:09.040> you<00:01:09.280> see<00:01:09.460> a

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
the AAA flip it back over and you see a

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.240 
the AAA flip it back over and you see a
whole<00:01:09.790> pile<00:01:10.030> of<00:01:10.060> buttons<00:01:10.479> on<00:01:10.630> the<00:01:10.750> left<00:01:10.960> side

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
whole pile of buttons on the left side

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.859 
whole pile of buttons on the left side
that's<00:01:12.250> because<00:01:12.640> while<00:01:12.850> some<00:01:13.150> games<00:01:13.360> play<00:01:13.810> in

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
that's because while some games play in

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:17.520 
that's because while some games play in
horizontal<00:01:14.619> mode<00:01:15.030> others<00:01:16.030> go<00:01:16.690> full<00:01:17.020> verticle

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
horizontal mode others go full verticle

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.730 
horizontal mode others go full verticle
I<00:01:18.509> think<00:01:19.509> this<00:01:19.630> was<00:01:19.780> the<00:01:19.810> first<00:01:19.930> system<00:01:20.440> to<00:01:20.560> do

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
I think this was the first system to do

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.590 
I think this was the first system to do
it<00:01:20.890> and<00:01:21.070> that's<00:01:21.399> pretty<00:01:21.640> damn<00:01:21.910> innovative<00:01:24.600> the

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
it and that's pretty damn innovative the

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.749 
it and that's pretty damn innovative the
sound<00:01:25.899> on<00:01:26.110> the<00:01:26.229> wonderswan<00:01:26.619> color<00:01:26.800> isn't

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
sound on the wonderswan color isn't

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:29.580 
sound on the wonderswan color isn't
terrible<00:01:28.180> either<00:01:28.509> but<00:01:29.080> it's<00:01:29.200> a<00:01:29.320> little<00:01:29.470> bit

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
terrible either but it's a little bit

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.600
