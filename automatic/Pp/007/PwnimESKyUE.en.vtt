dealing<00:01:31.080> with<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:31.229> tutorial<00:01:31.799> involves

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
dealing with it tutorial involves

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.520 
dealing with it tutorial involves
explosives<00:01:32.850> with<00:01:33.390> in<00:01:33.510> Minecraft<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:34.170> like<00:01:34.380> to

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
explosives with in Minecraft I like to

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.679 
explosives with in Minecraft I like to
go<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.680> my<00:01:34.890> options<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.460> just<00:01:35.820> turn<00:01:36.090> off<00:01:36.119> TNT

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
go to my options and just turn off TNT

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.050 
go to my options and just turn off TNT
as<00:01:37.049> you<00:01:37.170> can<00:01:37.290> see<00:01:37.470> I<00:01:37.500> have<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.770> done<00:01:37.920> here<00:01:38.189> TNT

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
as you can see I have it done here TNT

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.240 
as you can see I have it done here TNT
explodes<00:01:39.689> off<00:01:40.020> it's<00:01:40.650> just<00:01:40.830> easier<00:01:41.189> when

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
explodes off it's just easier when

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.410 
explodes off it's just easier when
you're<00:01:41.460> dealing<00:01:41.640> with<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:42.000> so<00:01:42.150> that<00:01:42.299> it

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
you're dealing with it so that it

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.969 
you're dealing with it so that it
doesn't<00:01:42.570> blow<00:01:42.780> up<00:01:42.810> half<00:01:43.170> way<00:01:43.229> throughs<00:01:43.619> if<00:01:43.860> you

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
doesn't blow up half way throughs if you

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.100 
doesn't blow up half way throughs if you
make<00:01:44.159> some<00:01:44.369> kind<00:01:44.580> of<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.670> redstone<00:01:45.000> mistake<00:01:45.509> now

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
make some kind of a redstone mistake now

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.570 
make some kind of a redstone mistake now
the<00:01:46.170> redstone<00:01:46.560> is<00:01:46.590> going<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:46.979> be<00:01:47.040> involved<00:01:47.490> in

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
the redstone is going to be involved in

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.820 
the redstone is going to be involved in
this<00:01:47.700> is<00:01:47.909> up<00:01:48.240> above<00:01:48.540> here<00:01:48.930> so<00:01:49.350> we<00:01:49.470> need<00:01:49.650> a

on the back of this i'm going to put
down<00:02:27.569> a<00:02:27.810> comparator<00:02:28.530> like<00:02:28.980> so<00:02:29.520> now<00:02:30.209> next<00:02:30.750> I'm

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
down a comparator like so now next I'm

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.440 
down a comparator like so now next I'm
going<00:02:30.930> to<00:02:31.200> dig<00:02:31.560> down<00:02:31.770> two<00:02:32.280> holes<00:02:32.580> I'm<00:02:33.000> going<00:02:33.390> to

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
going to dig down two holes I'm going to

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.780 
going to dig down two holes I'm going to
get<00:02:33.569> my<00:02:33.720> redstone<00:02:34.170> dust<00:02:34.620> I'm<00:02:34.920> gonna<00:02:35.130> place<00:02:35.340> one

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
get my redstone dust I'm gonna place one

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.820 
get my redstone dust I'm gonna place one
bit<00:02:35.970> of<00:02:36.000> redstone<00:02:36.269> dust<00:02:36.540> here<00:02:36.930> and<00:02:37.080> one<00:02:37.620> but<00:02:37.800> a

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
bit of redstone dust here and one but a

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.830 
bit of redstone dust here and one but a
redstone<00:02:38.160> dust<00:02:38.430> here<00:02:38.760> now<00:02:39.180> when<00:02:39.390> you<00:02:39.450> open<00:02:39.750> the

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
redstone dust here now when you open the

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.479 
redstone dust here now when you open the
chest<00:02:40.110> and<00:02:40.290> take<00:02:40.500> out<00:02:40.680> your<00:02:40.800> item<00:02:41.160> it's<00:02:41.340> going

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
chest and take out your item it's going

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.520 
chest and take out your item it's going
to<00:02:41.550> send<00:02:41.760> a<00:02:41.910> signal<00:02:42.269> crudest<00:02:42.840> block<00:02:43.050> to<00:02:43.500> the

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
to send a signal crudest block to the

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.259 
to send a signal crudest block to the
comparator<00:02:44.040> down<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.430> red<00:02:44.580> stone<00:02:44.790> and<00:02:45.030> it's

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
comparator down the red stone and it's

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.449 
comparator down the red stone and it's
going<00:02:45.480> to<00:02:45.660> activate<00:02:46.019> TT<00:02:46.680> once<00:02:46.980> we<00:02:47.130> have<00:02:47.280> it<00:02:47.310> all

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
going to activate TT once we have it all

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.150 
going to activate TT once we have it all
hooked<00:02:47.760> up<00:02:48.030> so<00:02:48.810> what<00:02:48.989> next<00:02:49.260> we<00:02:49.739> are<00:02:49.830> going<00:02:50.010> to

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
hooked up so what next we are going to

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.460 
hooked up so what next we are going to
get<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:50.640> block<00:02:51.030> of<00:02:51.209> our<00:02:51.299> choice<00:02:51.510> we're<00:02:52.230> going

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
get the block of our choice we're going

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.340 
get the block of our choice we're going
to<00:02:52.590> place<00:02:52.860> an<00:02:53.069> over<00:02:53.459> the<00:02:53.549> redstone<00:02:54.360> like<00:02:54.780> so

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
to place an over the redstone like so

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.740 
to place an over the redstone like so
then<00:02:56.040> we're<00:02:56.250> going<00:02:56.370> to<00:02:56.459> dig<00:02:56.760> down<00:02:57.000> two<00:02:57.569> blocks

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
then we're going to dig down two blocks

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.440 
then we're going to dig down two blocks
here<00:02:58.410> and<00:02:58.560> we<00:02:59.280> can<00:02:59.430> just<00:02:59.549> dig<00:02:59.730> out<00:02:59.850> all<00:02:59.880> of<00:03:00.150> this

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
here and we can just dig out all of this

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.449 
here and we can just dig out all of this
right<00:03:00.840> here<00:03:01.140> it's<00:03:01.319> much<00:03:01.560> easier<00:03:01.590> to<00:03:02.010> work<00:03:02.400> with

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
right here it's much easier to work with

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.780 
right here it's much easier to work with
if<00:03:03.330> you<00:03:03.510> do<00:03:03.840> this<00:03:04.049> so<00:03:04.620> just<00:03:05.010> get<00:03:05.130> rid<00:03:05.250> of<00:03:05.340> all<00:03:05.640> of

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
if you do this so just get rid of all of

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.880 
if you do this so just get rid of all of
this<00:03:06.060> and<00:03:06.330> we're<00:03:07.140> going<00:03:07.260> to<00:03:07.290> place<00:03:07.500> down<00:03:07.680> a

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
this and we're going to place down a

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.059 
this and we're going to place down a
redstone<00:03:08.250> torch<00:03:08.370> a<00:03:08.849> piece<00:03:09.780> of<00:03:09.930> redstone<00:03:10.620> and

redstone torch a piece of redstone and

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:12.979 
redstone torch a piece of redstone and
then<00:03:11.549> we're<00:03:11.700> gonna<00:03:11.819> place<00:03:12.060> down<00:03:12.299> or<00:03:12.540> the

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
then we're gonna place down or the

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
Spencer now remember to put down a

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:18.500 
Spencer now remember to put down a
dispenser<00:03:15.959> and<00:03:16.110> not<00:03:16.739> a<00:03:16.980> dropper<00:03:17.610> some<00:03:18.239> reason

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
dispenser and not a dropper some reason

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.360 
dispenser and not a dropper some reason
it<00:03:18.630> won't<00:03:18.780> go<00:03:18.900> down<00:03:18.930> for<00:03:19.230> me<00:03:19.290> there<00:03:19.560> we<00:03:19.680> go<00:03:19.829> now

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
it won't go down for me there we go now

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.699 
it won't go down for me there we go now
we<00:03:20.880> need<00:03:21.090> to<00:03:21.120> put<00:03:21.239> am<00:03:21.540> some<00:03:21.989> flint<00:03:22.290> and<00:03:22.410> steel

into this so we can place our flint and

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.259 
into this so we can place our flint and
steel<00:03:25.049> then<00:03:25.769> in<00:03:25.980> front<00:03:26.370> of<00:03:26.549> this<00:03:26.730> we<00:03:27.030> are<00:03:27.150> going

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269

make<00:03:48.780> the<00:03:48.900> explosion<00:03:49.380> bigger<00:03:49.560> of<00:03:49.799> course<00:03:50.010> you

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
make the explosion bigger of course you

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.050

can put in as much TNT as you want and
this<00:03:54.060> doesn't<00:03:54.329> seem<00:03:54.569> to<00:03:54.750> be<00:03:54.840> going<00:03:55.049> here<00:03:55.350> for
