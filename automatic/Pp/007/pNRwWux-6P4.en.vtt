00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.750
 I returned a mass they dissolved with 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.350
 this hot despite 160,000 serious in 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.690
 this kitchen 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.689
 this time we will not turn on the oven 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.779
 indeed we prepare something sweet good 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.779
 and above all a fresh kind of ice cream 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.140
 it will be worth a cheese cake coffe cupcake to come 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.009
 out 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.050
 discover the whole we start with three 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.940
 row temperature poles 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.140
 environment and just the weapons that leave 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.360
 out five minutes to the three stakes of 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.140
 ask you to combine two packs from 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.180
 170 grams of condensed milk 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:52.800
 sweetened and this fun rule 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:01:03.809
 and very sweet and we join him to his 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:06.060
 philadelphia we also add 80 ml of cream 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.189
 fresh to assemble so not the one that 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.670
 we use for macaroni but that which 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.560
 we use to assemble and end with 2 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.090
 teaspoons of grated rind of 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.049
 lemon and I put a little more because it is 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.970
 the lemon likes and so this is it 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.990
 few simple ingredients and now 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.990
 we operate instead 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.539
 we mix at low speed because we don't 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:30.890
 we clearly want to splash milk 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:33.109
 although really good that will be 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.170
 rewarded what little I have 

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:38.210
 accidentally spilled accounts is not 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.520
 carlo with lady will hold a little I'll get the 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:45.110
 bowl 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:46.819
 we amalgamate everyone well 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.020
 how many ingredients until 

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:50.020
 compound is homogeneous 

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:58.640
 once the mixture is nice smooth 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:01.700
 and homogeneous we transfer into a container 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.829
 and we suggest it for about four hours or 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:11.769
 until the mixture is beautiful 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:14.480
 money helping us with a food processor 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:17.060
 literally pulverize a pan 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.069
 and half are these trays from 125 here 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.459
 grams of raspberries or if we can we can 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:24.500
 what the strawberries and blueberries the blackberries is not 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:29.200
 then naples reminds the summer then one 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.200
 nobody and no tank takes it from me 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:03:01.640
 let's see something I don't know what time whim 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.920
 I still love you strangely with your hands in 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.769
 shape when we were kids 3 cookies 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.650
 saiwa gold the classic ones we leave gods 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:14.209
 brits were quite big and therefore not 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:15.769
 too quickly for them to understand each other 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.680
 time our ice cream is almost there 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:22.640
 solidified here it is I'm doing a 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.860
 little effort I transfer it back to the 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.630
 mixer bowl and we begin to make 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.380
 go there himself fine when the 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:32.900
 composed 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:34.760
 come back soft once you almost like 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.190
 by magic our ice cream because of 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:40.250
 ice cream it is is standing back 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:44.329
 soft we add our biscuits 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:50.450
 then such grated saiwa sheets and 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:51.950
 our raspberry puree once 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.780
 frontier in transfer for the last 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.069
 time our compound inside the 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.190
 same container we used 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:04:01.730
 to freeze our first time 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:04.690
 ice cream and let it freeze again 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.690
 completely 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:13.810
 another operation we will do will be that 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.300
 to dissolve in the microwave or bain-marie 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.610
 exchanges that make chocolate microwaves 

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:20.410
 we put the fudge drops in the 

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.660
 do it microwave interval of 30 seconds 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.640
 always mixing myself after about one 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.190
 minute then 30 seconds thirty seconds 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.690
 I get a nice chocolate clearly 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.660
 quality of the raw material is 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.760
 very important we take some baking cups 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.380
 the ones that certainly have silicone 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.120
 don't like them much but for this type 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.220
 of things are phenomenal 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.590
 so we want you clearly 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:44.920
 quite consistent with ours 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:47.370
 teaspoon we tell a quantity of 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:49.960
 dark chocolate and we put it 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:52.650
 inside both in the edges and 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:56.080
 especially on the bottom of ours 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:05:03.610
 we discover it completely 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:11.020
 clearly inside once 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:12.310
 covered once everything is covered 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.900
 it also concerns backlight that there is not 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.180
 they are holes and therefore I must not see 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.430
 no red because I pilot red 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.980
 inside we transfer everyone 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.780
 pertini in the refrigerator for about 10 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:24.580
 minutes a quarter of an hour to solidify e 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:27.040
 then we repeat the same operation one 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:29.410
 second time then a second layer 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.910
 of chocolate inside the piero 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:33.670
 holds that clearly they will be then to the 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:36.820
 end our baking cups for a 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:39.340
 special ice cream a solidified fashion 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:43.120
 here is how they come about with 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:45.700
 be very careful lifting the paper cups 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.440
 here comes a baking cups the 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.390
 chocolate let's remember it came out carlo con 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.550
 this heat is less possible and left 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:52.990
 always fridge more in the fridge and friend 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.490
 of our chocolate 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:56.470
 well meanwhile but now we proceed 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.849
 to the last part 

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:01.610
 about a quarter of an hour before serving 

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:04.069
 our ice cream cheese cake albo it 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:07.069
 we take the freezer out of the refrigerator 

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:09.560
 our ice cream we leave it slightly 

00:06:07.069 --> 00:06:11.479
 soften with our infallible 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.610
 vegetable wall we will collect one 

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:16.879
 maximum two balls we are lever 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:18.379
 inside the baking cups and then we try 

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:20.060
 everything on the table if we want 

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:21.949
 we can decorate with a fresh raspberry 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.210
 with some syrup 

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:25.400
 to me comes to mind of amarena ad 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:27.430
 example but let's unleash the 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.430
 fantasy
