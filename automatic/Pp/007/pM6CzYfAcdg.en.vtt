00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:23.869
 order to be 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:23.869
 Oh Oh Oh 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:48.070
 wae ee 5 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:52.720
 For're just saw it just an 8-bit music when playing the 800 party headquarters r0 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:56.860
 I'm just going to literally hang out with Koon. 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:01:02.949
 Trust me both hands with your left hand here before. 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:04.390
 If you look very good, when you laugh slowly, here's the mute and the capital is cut 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:07.229
 Here, 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.229
 Run your hand. 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.890
 Well Lets move to the left, where hers 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:25.679
 I'm sure that is coming to play a song like this 8pt 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:29.490
 8 Vito lot so you see it'll be almost as 8-bit music 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:31.469
 Slowly old societies can be hit, but if you slow it down , 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:36.240
 Truck 1 2 3 

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:40.350
 But you can beat it, but the 8-bit people answer most of the songs 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.849
 Helper If you want to be fast, 8bit will warm up and your name will change. 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.950
 It's changed. 

00:01:41.849 --> 00:01:51.409
 In this way, the songs that go way if the important thing here is shaped 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.409
 The exact strokes that are continuous 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:03.840
 And I got three of these things right before the precise code fingering . 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:07.500
 This is because the spoon is a little younger , 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:14.040
 Just grab normally only guess juneunde 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:14.790
 And then again, this is the code that should be caught 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.500
 Can I Know that 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:24.660
 This is not geuraeyaji missteps did a very grungy sound so certain 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:28.620
 The boy came out with a little more blunt sound 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.570
 It comes with purity, and if it does not mean it's not clean. 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.260
 Stroke is less clear 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:38.040
 But I just hit it with a really big pick. 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:40.790
 So when she brings out a little cloth can not catch the first issue well on the left 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.790
 For example , 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.280
 I have to go this way . 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:52.350
 5 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:55.970
 Oh , I only have a few voices, and sometimes, 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.970
 You can not do this by touching the line. 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:05.739
 I appreciate it. I like it. 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:09.959
 Precisely because it is not exactly fit 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:09.959
 Spit slowly 8 and practice slowly too 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.040
 oo ah 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:22.730
 Oo 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:23.569
 Oh, I always tell you, but it's the hardest to practice slowly. 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.129
 It's hard 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.129
 But you must do it. 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.420
 tera 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.640
 were 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.640
 Ah 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:52.840
 That way, now in the middle, like the Korean 800 , 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:54.310
 Now that we have to give this fact, we can change Stoke . 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:59.350
 Except that. 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:03.820
 Today ditch appropriate Lute considerable problems when playing this Mint and 8-bit 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:08.410
 We are going to use from the previous time and catch the correct code 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:12.570
 If you start with stretching exercises, you will pay the full amount 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.570
 You 'll be very helpful when you play .
