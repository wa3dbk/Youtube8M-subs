00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:17.230 
5s head-to-head so these are probably

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.020 
5s head-to-head so these are probably
going<00:00:17.440> to<00:00:17.530> be<00:00:17.650> the<00:00:17.920> two<00:00:18.190> hottest<00:00:18.640> selling

back now which is nice to see but
plastic<00:00:37.450> is<00:00:37.540> still<00:00:37.570> plastic<00:00:38.260> so<00:00:38.380> the<00:00:38.470> iphone

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800 
plastic is still plastic so the iphone

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.190 
plastic is still plastic so the iphone
just<00:00:39.040> feel<00:00:39.280> a<00:00:39.310> little<00:00:39.489> bit<00:00:39.610> more<00:00:39.760> premium<00:00:40.200> not

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:55.270 
actually heart rate sensor underneath so

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.350 
actually heart rate sensor underneath so
kind<00:00:55.840> of<00:00:55.899> something<00:00:56.140> the<00:00:56.230> iphone<00:00:56.500> doesn't<00:00:56.649> got

folks but this camera stack to stick out
a<00:01:03.700> little<00:01:03.850> bit<00:01:04.149> both<00:01:04.719> have<00:01:04.959> beautiful

00:01:05.699 --> 00:01:05.709 
a little bit both have beautiful

00:01:05.709 --> 00:01:08.609 
a little bit both have beautiful
displays<00:01:06.069> 1080p<00:01:07.060> obviously<00:01:07.450> on<00:01:07.569> the<00:01:07.600> on<00:01:08.380> the

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619 
displays 1080p obviously on the on the

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:10.679 
displays 1080p obviously on the on the
s5<00:01:09.039> against<00:01:09.549> apples<00:01:09.880> Retina<00:01:10.149> display<00:01:10.509> and

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:10.689 
s5 against apples Retina display and

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:12.749 
s5 against apples Retina display and
they<00:01:11.049> both<00:01:11.170> also<00:01:11.499> now<00:01:11.829> have<00:01:11.859> fingerprint

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
they both also now have fingerprint

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:14.459 
they both also now have fingerprint
scanners<00:01:13.119> so<00:01:13.299> we<00:01:13.420> got<00:01:13.569> touch<00:01:13.749> ID<00:01:13.959> on<00:01:14.170> the<00:01:14.229> 5s

00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:14.469 
scanners so we got touch ID on the 5s

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:15.779 
scanners so we got touch ID on the 5s
which<00:01:14.889> is<00:01:15.039> you<00:01:15.369> know<00:01:15.399> we're<00:01:15.609> all<00:01:15.700> familiar

00:01:15.779 --> 00:01:15.789 
which is you know we're all familiar

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:18.120 
which is you know we're all familiar
with<00:01:16.090> works<00:01:16.600> brilliantly<00:01:17.020> it's<00:01:17.889> like<00:01:18.100> a

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
with works brilliantly it's like a

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.819 
with works brilliantly it's like a
swiping<00:01:18.850> motion<00:01:19.240> though<00:01:19.450> on<00:01:19.569> the<00:01:19.600> and<00:01:20.289> the<00:01:20.499> s5

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:20.829 
swiping motion though on the and the s5

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:22.349 
swiping motion though on the and the s5
so<00:01:21.009> it's<00:01:21.159> not<00:01:21.310> quite<00:01:21.459> as<00:01:21.670> comfortable<00:01:21.880> to<00:01:22.209> use

00:01:22.349 --> 00:01:22.359 
so it's not quite as comfortable to use

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:24.510 
so it's not quite as comfortable to use
I<00:01:22.509> don't<00:01:22.659> think<00:01:22.889> you<00:01:23.889> manage<00:01:24.159> them<00:01:24.340> in<00:01:24.429> the

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
I don't think you manage them in the

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.699 
I don't think you manage them in the
same<00:01:24.729> kind<00:01:24.999> of<00:01:25.090> way<00:01:25.270> you<00:01:25.869> can<00:01:26.020> register<00:01:26.229> more

00:01:26.699 --> 00:01:26.709 
same kind of way you can register more

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:31.230 
same kind of way you can register more
than<00:01:26.829> one<00:01:26.979> fingerprint<00:01:27.490> on<00:01:29.039> both<00:01:30.039> but<00:01:30.789> the<00:01:30.939> s5

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
than one fingerprint on both but the s5

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.120 
than one fingerprint on both but the s5
you<00:01:31.509> can<00:01:31.659> actually<00:01:31.810> use<00:01:32.020> the<00:01:32.649> fingerprint

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
you can actually use the fingerprint

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.219 
you can actually use the fingerprint
authentication<00:01:33.909> toupees<00:01:34.479> in<00:01:34.689> paypal<00:01:35.079> and<00:01:35.170> I

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
authentication toupees in paypal and I

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:36.779 
authentication toupees in paypal and I
kind<00:01:35.439> of<00:01:35.469> like<00:01:35.619> that<00:01:35.829> wish<00:01:36.069> Apple<00:01:36.459> have<00:01:36.609> maybe

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:36.789 
kind of like that wish Apple have maybe

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:39.120 
kind of like that wish Apple have maybe
gone<00:01:36.999> on<00:01:37.149> board<00:01:37.359> with<00:01:37.630> with<00:01:38.469> maybe<00:01:38.679> paypal<00:01:39.099> or

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
gone on board with with maybe paypal or

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.919 
gone on board with with maybe paypal or
some<00:01:39.429> other<00:01:39.549> payment<00:01:40.149> companies<00:01:40.329> so<00:01:40.719> that<00:01:40.749> we

00:01:40.919 --> 00:01:40.929 
some other payment companies so that we

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:43.409 
some other payment companies so that we
could<00:01:41.049> use<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:42.130> fingerprint<00:01:42.729> for<00:01:42.969> more<00:01:43.209> than

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:43.419 
could use the fingerprint for more than

00:01:43.419 --> 00:01:48.279 
could use the fingerprint for more than
just<00:01:43.799> apples<00:01:44.799> apples<00:01:45.669> own<00:01:45.819> apps<00:01:46.060> and<00:01:46.270> content

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:48.289 
just apples apples own apps and content

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:50.810 
just apples apples own apps and content
so<00:01:49.289> different<00:01:49.590> in<00:01:49.649> design<00:01:49.770> different<00:01:50.759> in

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
so different in design different in

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.810 
so different in design different in
execution<00:01:51.420> but<00:01:52.109> this<00:01:52.259> is<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.500> choice<00:01:52.679> that

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
execution but this is the choice that

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.490 
execution but this is the choice that
many<00:01:53.820> of<00:01:53.969> us<00:01:54.060> will<00:01:54.210> be<00:01:54.270> left<00:01:54.570> with<00:01:54.780> until<00:01:55.380> the

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
many of us will be left with until the

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.620 
many of us will be left with until the
iphone<00:01:55.829> 6<00:01:56.039> comes<00:01:56.369> out<00:01:56.579> we'll<00:01:57.149> take<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.329> look<00:01:57.509> at

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
iphone 6 comes out we'll take a look at

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.270
