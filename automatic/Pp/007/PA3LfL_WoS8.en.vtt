now when it comes to the ps4 we know

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.499 
now when it comes to the ps4 we know
that<00:01:35.159> Sony<00:01:35.369> has<00:01:35.460> been<00:01:35.700> developing<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.299> for

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
that Sony has been developing it for

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.140 
that Sony has been developing it for
quite<00:01:37.079> a<00:01:37.140> while<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.860> we<00:01:38.070> are<00:01:38.220> all<00:01:38.400> curious<00:01:38.759> to

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
quite a while and we are all curious to

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.700 
quite a while and we are all curious to
see<00:01:39.299> what<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:39.689> winds<00:01:39.960> up<00:01:40.020> looking<00:01:40.170> like<00:01:40.350> but

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
see what it winds up looking like but

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:41.810 
see what it winds up looking like but
something<00:01:41.070> that<00:01:41.189> I<00:01:41.220> thought<00:01:41.430> was<00:01:41.490> kind<00:01:41.700> of

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
something that I thought was kind of

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.760 
something that I thought was kind of
interesting<00:01:41.970> is<00:01:42.540> that<00:01:42.869> they<00:01:43.140> were<00:01:43.200> discussing

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
interesting is that they were discussing

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.210 
interesting is that they were discussing
how<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.579> other<00:01:44.930> Playstations<00:01:45.930> one<00:01:46.740> two<00:01:47.009> and
