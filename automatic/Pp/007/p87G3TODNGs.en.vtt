impressive<00:01:24.960> like<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:25.170> said<00:01:25.409> I'm<00:01:25.500> pretty<00:01:25.680> sure

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
impressive like I said I'm pretty sure

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.649 
impressive like I said I'm pretty sure
this<00:01:26.070> is<00:01:26.189> my<00:01:26.220> most<00:01:26.490> kills<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.060> ghosts<00:01:27.450> thus

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
of what it deserves I guess not the

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.080 
of what it deserves I guess not the
greatest<00:02:38.130> game<00:02:38.280> in<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.400> world<00:02:38.580> that<00:02:38.730> also<00:02:38.880> has

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
greatest game in the world that also has
