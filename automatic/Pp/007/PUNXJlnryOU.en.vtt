00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
for this map because I was pretty much

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.830 
for this map because I was pretty much
the<00:02:34.079> update<00:02:34.670> and<00:02:35.670> when<00:02:36.269> you're<00:02:36.390> playing<00:02:36.630> on

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
which is another good place to camp now

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.230 
which is another good place to camp now
if<00:03:55.470> you<00:03:55.620> get<00:03:55.770> the<00:03:55.950> bc's<00:03:56.340> poem<00:03:56.670> that's<00:03:56.850> a<00:03:57.030> really

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.240 
if you get the bc's poem that's a really

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.110 
if you get the bc's poem that's a really
good<00:03:57.420> place<00:03:57.600> to<00:03:57.720> camp<00:03:57.900> just<00:03:58.140> be<00:03:58.350> wary<00:03:58.560> because

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
good place to camp just be wary because

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.510 
good place to camp just be wary because
there's<00:04:00.120> not<00:04:00.360> a<00:04:00.420> lot<00:04:00.660> of<00:04:00.690> cover<00:04:01.020> and<00:04:01.260> it<00:04:02.250> can

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:02.520 
there's not a lot of cover and it can

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.830 
there's not a lot of cover and it can
either<00:04:03.360> make<00:04:03.840> you<00:04:03.870> or<00:04:04.050> break<00:04:04.200> you<00:04:04.410> because

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
either make you or break you because

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.470 
either make you or break you because
it's<00:04:06.840> kind<00:04:07.440> of<00:04:07.530> tough<00:04:07.740> to<00:04:07.820> do<00:04:08.820> that<00:04:09.030> camp<00:04:09.360> thing

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
it's kind of tough to do that camp thing

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:15.620 
it's kind of tough to do that camp thing
area<00:04:10.820> so<00:04:11.820> i'm<00:04:13.160> also<00:04:14.160> on<00:04:14.790> this<00:04:14.940> map<00:04:15.180> if<00:04:15.450> you

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
area so i'm also on this map if you

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.370 
area so i'm also on this map if you
spawn<00:04:15.990> a<00:04:16.200> what<00:04:17.130> I<00:04:17.160> suggest<00:04:17.760> is<00:04:17.970> going<00:04:18.420> in<00:04:18.600> just

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
spawn a what I suggest is going in just

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.580 
spawn a what I suggest is going in just
camping<00:04:20.040> the<00:04:20.160> bookstore<00:04:20.670> and<00:04:20.989> also<00:04:21.989> watching

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
camping the bookstore and also watching

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.940 
camping the bookstore and also watching
over<00:04:23.040> C<00:04:23.280> and<00:04:23.600> if<00:04:24.600> you<00:04:24.990> do<00:04:25.170> that<00:04:25.200> you<00:04:25.560> can<00:04:25.770> really

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
over C and if you do that you can really

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.530 
over C and if you do that you can really
just<00:04:26.190> get<00:04:26.370> a<00:04:26.400> good<00:04:26.610> vantage<00:04:26.760> point<00:04:27.270> on<00:04:27.420> this

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
just get a good vantage point on this

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.920 
just get a good vantage point on this
map<00:04:27.780> and<00:04:28.320> you<00:04:29.000> can<00:04:30.000> just<00:04:30.180> pretty<00:04:30.510> much<00:04:30.660> cover

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
map and you can just pretty much cover

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.460
