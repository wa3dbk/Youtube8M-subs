00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
you need to be toxic but for the most

part<00:00:39.510> Slyke<00:00:40.079> he<00:00:40.950> did<00:00:41.129> you<00:00:41.250> go<00:00:41.700> FK<00:00:41.969> for<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.629> while

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
part Slyke he did you go FK for a while

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.660 
part Slyke he did you go FK for a while
and<00:00:43.050> he<00:00:43.170> fed<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.500> quite<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:43.829> few<00:00:43.920> kills<00:00:44.309> but<00:00:44.640> I

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
and he fed to quite a few kills but I

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.360 
and he fed to quite a few kills but I
mean<00:00:44.989> going<00:00:45.989> too<00:00:46.170> much<00:00:46.200> into<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.620> one<00:00:46.770> so<00:00:47.070> I

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
mean going too much into that one so I

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.250 
mean going too much into that one so I
blew<00:00:47.910> my<00:00:47.940> ghost<00:00:48.329> here<00:00:48.629> for<00:00:48.930> that<00:00:49.079> could

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
blew my ghost here for that could

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.380 
blew my ghost here for that could
perhaps<00:00:49.410> catch<00:00:49.800> up<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.219> Caitlyn<00:00:50.910> or<00:00:51.030> something

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
perhaps catch up to Caitlyn or something

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.600 
perhaps catch up to Caitlyn or something
but<00:00:51.600> um<00:00:51.750> I'm<00:00:52.260> too<00:00:52.590> low<00:00:52.860> dad<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.219> do<00:00:53.309> anything

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
but um I'm too low dad to do anything

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.369 
but um I'm too low dad to do anything
but<00:00:53.699> that's<00:00:53.879> okay<00:00:54.120> because<00:00:54.149> this<00:00:54.930> has<00:00:55.350> a

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
but that's okay because this has a

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.740 
but that's okay because this has a
pretty<00:00:55.949> short<00:00:56.190> cooldown<00:00:56.460> it's<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.270> need<00:00:57.510> like

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
pretty short cooldown it's a need like

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.439 
pretty short cooldown it's a need like
three<00:00:58.710> minutes<00:00:58.920> as<00:00:59.219> opposed<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.730> flash<00:01:00.059> having

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
three minutes as opposed to flash having

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:07.520 
three minutes as opposed to flash having
like<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.750> five<00:01:01.079> minute<00:01:01.440> cooldown<00:01:02.930> so<00:01:06.530> it's

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
like a five minute cooldown so it's

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.440 
like a five minute cooldown so it's
build<00:01:07.830> that<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:08.070> go<00:01:08.310> is<00:01:08.580> pretty<00:01:08.850> much<00:01:08.939> i<00:01:09.150> get<00:01:09.210> my

pretty<00:01:32.040> much<00:01:32.130> scream<00:01:32.460> over<00:01:32.729> there<00:01:32.850> i<00:01:34.640> know<00:01:35.640> i

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
pretty much scream over there i know i

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.120 
pretty much scream over there i know i
have<00:01:36.299> no<00:01:36.540> idea<00:01:36.659> what<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.079> new<00:01:37.500> alpha<00:01:37.890> strike

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
have no idea what the new alpha strike

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.460 
have no idea what the new alpha strike
is<00:01:38.369> like<00:01:38.549> almost<00:01:38.970> as<00:01:39.329> opening<00:01:39.810> is<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.110> have<00:01:40.229> one

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
is like almost as opening is to have one

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.859 
is like almost as opening is to have one
i<00:01:42.560> think<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.649> fact<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:43.979> he<00:01:44.310> might<00:01:45.240> refreshes

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
i think the fact that he might refreshes

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.840 
i think the fact that he might refreshes
his<00:01:46.140> building<00:01:46.619> is<00:01:46.710> like

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
his building is like

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.140 
his building is like
every<00:01:48.390> kill<00:01:48.900> or<00:01:49.290> assist<00:01:50.009> as<00:01:50.400> a<00:01:50.460> place<00:01:50.880> like

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
every kill or assist as a place like

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.749 
every kill or assist as a place like
only<00:01:51.450> when<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:52.740> has<00:01:52.950> this<00:01:53.130> whole<00:01:53.369> film<00:01:53.580> on<00:01:53.670> or

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
only when it has this whole film on or

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.149 
only when it has this whole film on or
whatever<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.750> I<00:01:55.170> just<00:01:55.680> think<00:01:55.830> that<00:01:55.950> it's

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
whatever and I just think that it's

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.870 
whatever and I just think that it's
pretty<00:01:56.400> stupid<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:58.310> the<00:01:59.310> fact<00:01:59.580> that<00:01:59.670> his

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
pretty stupid and the fact that his

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.810 
pretty stupid and the fact that his
friggin<00:02:00.540> i'm<00:02:01.049> pretty<00:02:01.290> sure<00:02:01.470> that<00:02:01.500> his<00:02:01.860> his

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
friggin i'm pretty sure that his his

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.780 
friggin i'm pretty sure that his his
ultimate<00:02:03.390> last<00:02:03.630> heaps<00:02:04.080> longer<00:02:04.409> now<00:02:04.580> like<00:02:05.580> it

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
ultimate last heaps longer now like it

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.029 
ultimate last heaps longer now like it
just<00:02:05.820> feels<00:02:06.360> like<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:06.810> lasts<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.320> lot<00:02:07.409> longer<00:02:07.470> so

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
just feels like it lasts a lot longer so
