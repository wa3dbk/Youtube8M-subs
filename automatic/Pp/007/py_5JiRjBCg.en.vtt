00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.550
 hello everyone was so what are we 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.389
 is here today for my first 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.309
 video on youtube 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.719
 how to get some players 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.130
 free in the career mode of 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.740
 fifa 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:18.330
 so it's a pretty simple bug that I have 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.619
 discovery there is no video that in 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.630
 speak on youtube this is the first 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.820
 video that talks about this bug let's go 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.490
 take an English club and I'll go 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.750
 show how this is going on how 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.869
 make this bug 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.450
 just so you go in 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.000
 transfer obviously sought players 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.090
 we will just start with 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.520
 three arsenal players 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.670
 so here is exactly the same 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.840
 manipulations as in this video 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.930
 here we go on jo ann campbell 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.090
 approached for purchase we will propose 0 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.320
 euros and we will submit the offer in fact 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.079
 we will not touch down just submit 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:01:00.329
 the offer like that here is the second 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:02.670
 player is serge the shelter here is the same 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.930
 zero euro summed bids is the 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.159
 third player is a player 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:11.640
 really good oxlade chamberlain 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:12.720
 this is oxlade chamberlain so this bug 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.729
 works with other players 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.560
 so I will give you the list I will you 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.780
 will give the complete list of all 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:23.310
 players with whom this bug works 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.530
 so we will continue they will 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.420
 refuse arsenal will refuse you go 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.409
 see that there will be a second step 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.390
 for this bug 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.820
 we will make a new offer that you 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.729
 do submit new offer 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:38.280
 and there you rock with a kidney or done 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.890
 a loan offer have made field offer 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.540
 Loan 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.490
 so after they refused your 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.740
 offer d 01 euros you make a 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.870
 new offer that's going to be an offer of 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.790
 ready simply you will see that 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:53.720
 it will work I'm doing this for my 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:55.550
 three players here then I'm going 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.310
 move slowly and wait for the 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:01.580
 arsenal response regarding his players 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:05.690
 so the bug will work you go the 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:07.759
 see transfers accepted amount of 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:11.750
 transfer and rural so you do not have 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:13.880
 more than proposed the contract for the 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.459
 player here you put that when me 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:20.120
 I put five years for everyone 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:22.430
 here is for serge in April you propose 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.209
 after the contract pretty quiet they 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.470
 will accept 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.970
 so I want to clarify that if you 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.720
 do this bug with a french club 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.940
 chamberlain 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.860
 he may not accept a 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.870
 championship where they do not refuse everything 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:37.690
 just to go he refuses so here 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:41.239
 you will see that they will accept 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.950
 accepted proposition here it is a bus 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:44.930
 that worked and precisely you have 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.450
 seen on the video I do not know if you have 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.799
 seen they say they keep hop this blog 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.489
 also works with this player from 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:53.269
 Manchester United 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:56.090
 it also works with the top loos 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:59.480
 the players we will try it for free 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.010
 when I told you the list will be on 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.570
 my youtube channel on my facebook or 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.700
 on my twitter anyway I you 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.769
 will inform i think i will you 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.989
 will inform on the youtube channel or on 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:10.280
 my facebook rather which I was worth a 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.720
 report team for you 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:17.480
 see that these players there are well 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:18.680
 free arrivals there I had to 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.400
 get rid of a player to be able to 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.220
 accept 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.579
 joel campbell what my workforce was 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.970
 full so we'll go in the report to 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:29.180
 team 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:32.480
 this time to show you 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.790
 so one this bug there frankly it is 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:38.269
 very simple when you could see it 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.900
 so yes recently arrived from arsenal for 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:43.189
 zero euro 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.629
 it's really huge bug it was great 

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:45.980
 surprised but that I discovered there are 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:47.180
 super long anyway but that's 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.409
 just that I hesitated to do this 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:53.659
 video of fear that some people 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:55.819
 here is a little bit this bug appropriate 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:57.349
 this bug so this bug 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:59.510
 you will see that it works with 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:01.129
 elvin except that he was loaned a club 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.689
 Brazilian knowing that the championship 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:03.859
 Brazilian is not in the game you 

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:05.659
 do not go see it in your way 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:10.220
 so bakary konÃ© it works with 

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:13.459
 him also so we will move forward we will 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:15.019
 i can not do a max one will go 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:16.340
 to make a match so that we will not 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:17.570
 start the match it's just for you 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.320
 show that the players are well in 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.269
 my team 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.979
 this is how I told you I had 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.990
 just afraid that some people 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:26.060
 take over this bug and get some views 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.470
 and for example, it's them who 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.979
 have as soon as they discovered this blog is 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.000
 all while nada does nothing at all 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:36.020
 so if you ever want to make a 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:39.470
 video on this bug inform me or put 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:41.419
 my name in the description or whatever 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.470
 thing because it's true that it would be 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:44.630
 a little weird if some 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.789
 youtuber say yes it's me who has it 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.550
 it was I who discovered this blog is 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:52.010
 everything while they made the video 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:54.889
 after me you see it would be a little 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:57.530
 montage says do you see I rather see you 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:59.449
 it would be a little weird 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.849
 Here it's just right 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:05.659
 I was just scared of that 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:08.259
 so I'm going to show you all this the 

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:11.630
 video will soon come to an end 

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:13.639
 okay and I mentioned all the points 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.860
 that I wanted to discuss with you I'm going 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:19.039
 do a tutorial on how 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:21.050
 boost the potential of some young people 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:23.030
 players so young players who have 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:25.400
 a potential of at least 75 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:27.860
 we can boost them up to 90 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.060
 potential it's amazing so if you 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.370
 have a day in your team that has a 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:33.050
 potential of 75 you can boost it 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.479
 up to 90 how to know if one day a 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:37.639
 potential of 75 thanks to a site that 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:38.660
 is called sophie fa.com anyway 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:42.530
 I tell you 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:44.270
 later on so that was all for 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:45.950
 me today I hope this bug is going 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.480
 make you happy I hope you 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:50.000
 go make very good choices of 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:53.080
 career and I tell you to the next 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.080
