very slow and methodically and that

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.200 
very slow and methodically and that
feels<00:01:17.290> terrific<00:01:17.560> again<00:01:18.520> we're<00:01:18.729> going<00:01:18.850> to<00:01:19.000> do

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
feels terrific again we're going to do

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.660 
feels terrific again we're going to do
this<00:01:19.979> similarly<00:01:20.979> to<00:01:21.160> doing<00:01:21.430> the<00:01:21.490> lat

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
this similarly to doing the lat

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.100 
this similarly to doing the lat
pull-downs<00:01:21.940> we're<00:01:22.660> not<00:01:22.780> going<00:01:22.930> to<00:01:22.960> really

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
pull-downs we're not going to really

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.139 
pull-downs we're not going to really
count<00:01:23.380> repetitions<00:01:24.070> we're<00:01:24.580> just<00:01:24.850> going<00:01:25.119> to

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:25.149 
count repetitions we're just going to

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:26.880 
count repetitions we're just going to
keep<00:01:25.390> going<00:01:25.600> until<00:01:25.990> we<00:01:26.590> can<00:01:26.740> no<00:01:26.770> longer

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
keep going until we can no longer

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.270 
keep going until we can no longer
perform<00:01:27.340> in<00:01:27.820> this<00:01:28.030> perfect<00:01:28.360> line<00:01:28.750> or<00:01:29.280> until

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
muscles and the body start coming into

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.430 
muscles and the body start coming into
play<00:01:33.940> and<00:01:34.210> that's<00:01:34.690> when<00:01:34.869> we<00:01:34.960> know<00:01:35.110> it's<00:01:35.289> time

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
play and that's when we know it's time

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.560 
play and that's when we know it's time
to<00:01:35.649> take<00:01:35.830> it<00:01:35.860> to<00:01:36.220> take<00:01:36.550> a<00:01:36.580> step<00:01:36.880> back<00:01:37.090> and<00:01:37.360> relax

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
to take it to take a step back and relax

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.499 
to take it to take a step back and relax
now<00:01:40.570> I'm<00:01:40.780> moving<00:01:41.020> very<00:01:41.200> slow<00:01:41.530> methodical

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
now I'm moving very slow methodical

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.850 
now I'm moving very slow methodical
occasionally<00:01:43.509> you<00:01:44.110> could<00:01:44.259> change<00:01:44.500> up<00:01:44.740> the

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
occasionally you could change up the

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.449 
occasionally you could change up the
speed<00:01:45.160> and<00:01:45.310> it'll<00:01:45.520> feel<00:01:45.670> really<00:01:46.119> good<00:01:47.250> so<00:01:48.250> long

00:01:48.449 --> 00:01:48.459 
speed and it'll feel really good so long

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:50.330 
speed and it'll feel really good so long
as<00:01:48.640> you're<00:01:48.789> continuing<00:01:49.360> in<00:01:49.450> the<00:01:49.509> same<00:01:49.690> form

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
as you're continuing in the same form

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:57.610 
as you're continuing in the same form
this<00:01:51.340> is<00:01:51.490> what<00:01:51.640> they<00:01:51.729> call<00:01:51.910> pumping<00:01:52.179> iron

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:57.620 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.300 

that<00:01:58.620> feels<00:01:58.860> good

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
that feels good

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.880 
that feels good
I<00:01:59.570> think<00:02:00.570> it's<00:02:00.690> very<00:02:00.810> important<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.380> focus<00:02:01.560> on

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
movements that are very important to

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.870 
movements that are very important to
back<00:02:21.750> development<00:02:22.350> the<00:02:23.010> first<00:02:23.250> exercise<00:02:23.700> we

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
back development the first exercise we

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.060 
back development the first exercise we
did<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.120> lat<00:02:24.300> pulldown<00:02:24.570> it's<00:02:25.560> terrific<00:02:25.890> for

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
did the lat pulldown it's terrific for

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.160 
did the lat pulldown it's terrific for
width<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.820> second<00:02:27.210> exercise<00:02:27.390> that<00:02:27.870> we<00:02:27.960> did

width the second exercise that we did

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
width the second exercise that we did
was<00:02:28.770> terrific<00:02:29.040> for<00:02:29.990> the<00:02:30.990> middle<00:02:31.860> of<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.010> back

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
was terrific for the middle of the back

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.060 
was terrific for the middle of the back
and<00:02:32.430> depth<00:02:33.120> inside<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.870> back<00:02:34.050> this<00:02:34.800> third

exercise<00:02:35.370> that<00:02:35.700> we're<00:02:35.850> going<00:02:35.970> to<00:02:36.120> do<00:02:36.330> is

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
exercise that we're going to do is

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.140 
exercise that we're going to do is
called<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.440> dumbbell<00:02:37.980> row<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.610> dumbbell<00:02:39.000> row

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
called the dumbbell row the dumbbell row

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.150 
called the dumbbell row the dumbbell row
is<00:02:39.330> an<00:02:39.450> excellent<00:02:39.810> movement<00:02:40.350> and<00:02:40.470> it<00:02:40.770> actually

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
is an excellent movement and it actually

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.620 
is an excellent movement and it actually
will<00:02:41.280> encompass<00:02:41.580> both<00:02:41.850> of<00:02:42.270> those<00:02:42.360> things

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
will encompass both of those things

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.120 
will encompass both of those things
it'll<00:02:42.960> actually<00:02:43.110> bring<00:02:43.470> some<00:02:43.680> width<00:02:43.920> to<00:02:44.100> the

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
it'll actually bring some width to the

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.530 
it'll actually bring some width to the
back<00:02:44.370> and<00:02:44.550> also<00:02:44.700> work<00:02:44.940> the<00:02:44.970> muscles<00:02:45.420> in<00:02:45.510> the

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
back and also work the muscles in the

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.090 
back and also work the muscles in the
middle<00:02:45.810> of<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:45.960> back<00:02:46.140> but<00:02:46.650> what's<00:02:46.830> really

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
middle of the back but what's really

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.700 
middle of the back but what's really
important<00:02:47.790> is<00:02:48.420> that<00:02:48.480> we<00:02:48.630> relaxed<00:02:49.200> everything

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
important is that we relaxed everything

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.130 
important is that we relaxed everything
else<00:02:49.920> we<00:02:50.460> try<00:02:50.670> to<00:02:50.730> keep<00:02:50.940> very<00:02:51.270> very<00:02:51.480> composed

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
else we try to keep very very composed

else we try to keep very very composed
let<00:02:52.830> all<00:02:53.100> of<00:02:53.130> the<00:02:53.400> air<00:02:53.610> out<00:02:53.640> try<00:02:54.300> to<00:02:54.330> relax

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
let all of the air out try to relax

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.510 
let all of the air out try to relax
keep<00:02:55.140> the<00:02:55.320> muscles<00:02:55.680> around<00:02:55.770> the<00:02:56.040> neck<00:02:56.280> these

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
keep the muscles around the neck these

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.130 
keep the muscles around the neck these
are<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:56.760> trapezius<00:02:57.330> muscles<00:02:57.690> try<00:02:57.870> to<00:02:57.930> keep

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
are the trapezius muscles try to keep

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.229 
are the trapezius muscles try to keep
these<00:02:58.320> relaxed<00:02:58.890> and<00:02:59.310> keep<00:02:59.490> our<00:02:59.670> chest<00:02:59.880> up<00:03:00.120> at

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
these relaxed and keep our chest up at

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:01.940 
these relaxed and keep our chest up at
all<00:03:00.360> times<00:03:00.630> with<00:03:00.900> a<00:03:00.930> very<00:03:01.170> good<00:03:01.320> posture<00:03:01.620> and

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
all times with a very good posture and

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.490 
all times with a very good posture and
perform<00:03:02.640> our<00:03:02.820> back<00:03:03.000> movements<00:03:03.600> not<00:03:04.140> a<00:03:04.200> lot<00:03:04.410> of

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
perform our back movements not a lot of

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.920 
perform our back movements not a lot of
tension<00:03:04.709> in<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:04.980> hands<00:03:05.400> relaxed<00:03:06.390> keep<00:03:06.780> the

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
tension in the hands relaxed keep the

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.600 
tension in the hands relaxed keep the
thumbs<00:03:07.170> on<00:03:07.320> the<00:03:07.350> opposite<00:03:07.920> sides<00:03:08.130> of<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:08.400> bar

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
thumbs on the opposite sides of the bar

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.490 
thumbs on the opposite sides of the bar
so<00:03:09.120> we're<00:03:09.270> actually<00:03:09.420> using<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:09.930> hand<00:03:10.290> as

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
so we're actually using the hand as

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.890 
so we're actually using the hand as
almost<00:03:10.739> like<00:03:10.860> a<00:03:11.010> hook<00:03:11.430> to<00:03:12.060> pull<00:03:12.420> the<00:03:12.660> weights

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
almost like a hook to pull the weights

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.170 
almost like a hook to pull the weights
and<00:03:13.200> let<00:03:13.739> the<00:03:13.890> back<00:03:14.130> do<00:03:14.340> all<00:03:14.489> of<00:03:14.670> the<00:03:14.760> movement

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
and let the back do all of the movement

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.150 
and let the back do all of the movement
instead<00:03:15.630> of<00:03:15.750> forcing<00:03:16.380> the<00:03:16.470> weights<00:03:16.650> up<00:03:16.890> we're

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
instead of forcing the weights up we're

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.190 
instead of forcing the weights up we're
really<00:03:17.370> stressing<00:03:17.970> out<00:03:18.150> let<00:03:18.630> me<00:03:18.720> show<00:03:18.900> you<00:03:18.959> how

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
really stressing out let me show you how

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:29.650 
really stressing out let me show you how
to<00:03:19.260> do<00:03:19.500> the<00:03:19.920> dumbbell<00:03:20.190> row

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.130 

again<00:03:30.200> it's<00:03:30.350> really<00:03:30.410> a<00:03:30.680> two-part<00:03:31.070> movement

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
again it's really a two-part movement

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.620 
again it's really a two-part movement
pulling<00:03:33.140> once<00:03:33.910> going<00:03:34.910> twice

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
pulling once going twice

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.740 
pulling once going twice
letting<00:03:36.290> the<00:03:36.380> back<00:03:36.590> engage<00:03:37.360> by<00:03:38.360> really

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
letting the back engage by really

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.680 
letting the back engage by really
bringing<00:03:39.140> my<00:03:39.260> shoulder<00:03:39.830> up<00:03:40.130> and<00:03:40.760> back<00:03:41.360> at<00:03:41.600> the

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
bringing my shoulder up and back at the

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.020 
bringing my shoulder up and back at the
same<00:03:41.900> time<00:03:42.200> and<00:03:42.500> then<00:03:43.430> pulling<00:03:43.670> the<00:03:43.820> weights

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
same time and then pulling the weights

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.550 
same time and then pulling the weights
out<00:03:46.330> the<00:03:47.330> most<00:03:47.570> important<00:03:48.080> things<00:03:48.320> that<00:03:48.440> I

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
out the most important things that I

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.410 
out the most important things that I
keep<00:03:48.740> everything<00:03:48.950> relaxed<00:03:49.670> around<00:03:49.790> my<00:03:50.030> neck<00:03:50.240> I

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
keep everything relaxed around my neck I

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.040 
keep everything relaxed around my neck I
see<00:03:50.630> folks<00:03:51.110> in<00:03:51.290> the<00:03:51.380> gym<00:03:51.590> doing<00:03:51.770> this<00:03:52.040> alive<00:03:53.050> it

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 
see folks in the gym doing this alive it

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:55.510 
see folks in the gym doing this alive it
really<00:03:54.260> doesn't<00:03:54.500> do<00:03:54.620> anything<00:03:54.950> we're<00:03:55.220> really

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:55.520 
really doesn't do anything we're really

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.970 
really doesn't do anything we're really
trying<00:03:55.940> to<00:03:56.060> pull<00:03:56.300> back<00:03:56.570> at<00:03:56.960> the<00:03:57.170> same<00:03:57.380> time<00:03:57.710> as

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
trying to pull back at the same time as

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.980 
trying to pull back at the same time as
we're<00:03:58.160> pulling<00:03:58.340> up

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:02.990 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:04.900 

it<00:04:03.500> doesn't<00:04:03.800> matter<00:04:03.980> that<00:04:04.100> the<00:04:04.310> elbow<00:04:04.610> doesn't

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
it doesn't matter that the elbow doesn't

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.720 
it doesn't matter that the elbow doesn't
come<00:04:05.030> up<00:04:05.180> very<00:04:05.360> high<00:04:05.630> it<00:04:06.140> really<00:04:06.380> doesn't<00:04:06.730> so

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
come up very high it really doesn't so

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.190 
come up very high it really doesn't so
long<00:04:07.910> as<00:04:08.060> we're<00:04:08.210> engaging<00:04:08.510> the<00:04:08.750> muscles<00:04:09.110> in

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
long as we're engaging the muscles in

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.930
